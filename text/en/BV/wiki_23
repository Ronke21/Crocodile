<text>343 Guilty Spark, also known as just Spark, is a character in the military science fiction &quot;Halo&quot; franchise. Spark plays a major role in the storyline of the original &quot;Halo&quot; video game trilogy: the character appears in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Halo 2&quot;, and &quot;Halo 3&quot;, as well as the remakes of the first two games, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Spark is voiced by actor Tim Dadabo in all media.

Within series lore, Spark is an artificial intelligence entity whose role, as designated by his creators (the Forerunners), is to serve as the caretaker of one of several ring-shaped megastructures scattered throughout the galaxy known as the Halo Array, specifically Installation 04. The true purpose of each Halo installation is to contain any infestation of the extraterrestrial parasitic species known as the Flood via its activation by a suitable candidate known as a &quot;Reclaimer&quot;, which destroys all life within its blast radius. The character is also known by other names: the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) faction refer to him as the Monitor, and to the multi-species Covenant faction he is the Oracle because of his association with the legacy of his creators.

The original developers of the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, Bungie Studios, used the &quot;Star Wars&quot; droid character C-3PO as a reference point for Guilty Spark&#x27;s personality and voice, with the intention that his hidden agenda of genocide is masked by his genial attitude towards the player character. Further story developments in sequel novels published after the release of &quot;Halo 3&quot; reveal that a fragment of Guilty Spark survived his apparent destruction in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, and that he was originally created from the mind of a human being called Chakas several millennia before the events of the &quot;Halo&quot; series.

A prominent character in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, Spark is noted for alternating between the roles of benefactor and antagonist to the series&#x27; protagonist, Master Chief, and his allies. The character&#x27;s critical reception has been mixed; criticism focused on aspects of his personality and his role in the campaign mission gameplay, while his role in the games&#x27; narrative as an agent of revelation and provider of story exposition has been well-received.

==Design and attributes==
343 Guilty Spark is an artificial intelligence entity created by an ancient highly advanced species known as the Forerunners. Spark is presented as a compact, spherical machine, unlike the angular design of his allies, the Forerunner Sentinels. He moves around by hovering in the air, and possesses a single pulsating eye which normally glows blue; in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, Guilty Spark&#x27;s eye turns red when enraged and is capable of firing laser beams as an offensive measure. Spark operates with strict adherence to the Forerunners&#x27; programming protocols; he is unable to directly retrieve the activation index for the installation or reunite it with its Core to commence the firing process. He needs another being, specifically a member of the human race whom he refers to as the &quot;Reclaimers&quot;, to do this for him.

Bungie intended for the character to have a similar voice and disposition as C-3PO. The character&#x27;s voice actor Tim Dadabo noted that he was given leeway to develop his own style and personality in developing Guilty Spark for &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; as the characters were then relatively undefined, while he was specifically directed to get a little deeper and darker with the character in later games. Dadabo recalled that the Bungie developmental team was constantly making alterations to the game&#x27;s script and scenes even when recording was underway, and he would often be asked to go back and forth to the studio to record new lines. Dadabo noted that he was guided by project lead Jason Jones and lead writer Joseph Staten during the recording process, and that he received adequate context behind specific lines and scenes to emote his character. Dadabo described his character as a &quot;bastard&quot; who strings others along to accomplish his ends.

The character&#x27;s personality is presented as eccentric and quirky; he would proclaim himself a genius within hearing range of other individuals, hums to himself in the midst of a combat situation, demonstrates a &quot;cheerful, businesslike manner&quot; in the face of physical violence, and cheerfully instructs his Sentinel allies to &quot;save his head&quot; when attacking the Master Chief. Guilty Spark appears to be emotionally detached in contrast to fellow AI character Cortana and shows little empathy when his associates suffer injuries or even death, only lamenting the inconvenience of finding another individual who is willing and able to assist him to further his objectives; when Sesa &#x27;Refumee is killed by the Arbiter in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, he casually remarks that &#x27;Refumee&#x27;s &quot;edification was most enjoyable&quot;. It has been suggested that the construct is insane or mentally unstable due to the millennia he spent in solitude as the Monitor of Installation 04.

Despite his unusual personality traits, Guilty Spark is shown to be pragmatic and single-minded in the pursuit of his goals, and sees the world primarily in terms of outcomes. Though fully aware of what Installation 04 would do should it be activated, Guilty Spark persists on implementing the activation process and insists that it is the only viable option to quell the Flood outbreak. He did not provide the Master Chief with full disclosure of Installation 04&#x27;s capabilities during their first encounter, insisting that he did not elaborate because the Chief did not ask, and appeared to be under the presumption that all human &quot;Reclaimers&quot; are aware of the Halo installations&#x27; true purpose and are committed to the same objectives as he is.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;===

343 Guilty Spark makes his first appearance in the 2001 first-person shooter video game &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; as its primary antagonist. Series protagonist Master Chief, a human supersoldier who serves the UNSC, the military, exploratory, and scientific agency of the Unified Earth Government (UEG), first comes into contact with Guilty Spark in a swamp area of a ring-shaped megastructure (Halo) soon after encountering the Flood, a parasitic infestation accidentally released on the surface of the ring. Guilty Spark informs Master Chief that he is the Monitor of the ring and that he requires the Chief&#x27;s help in preventing the Flood from escaping the ring.

Using the megastructure&#x27;s teleportation grid, Spark teleports himself and the Master Chief to the Library, a vast complex that contains the Index, the ring&#x27;s firing key. After battling through successive waves of Flood with the assistance of the Guilty Spark&#x27;s robotic Sentinels, the Master Chief is able to claim the Index, upon which Guilty Spark teleports them to ring&#x27;s control room. Guilty Spark instructs him on how to activate Halo, explaining that such a task is too important for a construct such as himself to perform. As the Master Chief inserts the Index into the control panel, Cortana, having been left in the control room previously by the Chief, abruptly takes the Index before the firing sequence can be triggered. Cortana explains to a confused Master Chief that Halo is not designed to kill the Flood; it is designed to kill their food, which means any biomass of sufficient size to sustain the Flood. Guilty Spark confirms that the firing of the ring (known properly as Installation 04 or Alpha Halo) will cause the eradication of all sentient life within 25,000 light years, and in turn will cause the other identical installations in the Halo Array to fire, thus killing all sentient life within three galactic radii of the Milky Way. This revelation convinces the Master Chief to reject Guilty Spark&#x27;s plan.

With Cortana in possession of the Index, and Master Chief in possession of Cortana, Guilty Spark orders the Sentinels to kill him but &quot;save the head&quot;, which contains Cortana&#x27;s A.I. chip and thus the Index. Master Chief escapes and heads to the crashed wreckage of the &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; to detonate the ship&#x27;s reactors, destabilizing the ring. Despite the best efforts of the Monitor to halt the Chief and preserve Earth&#x27;s historical records stored in the &quot;Autumn&quot;″s memory banks, the vessel&#x27;s fusion reactors go critical, destroying much of the megastructure. Guilty Spark is revealed to have survived the installation&#x27;s destruction in the post credits scene and departs from its ruins.

The 2011 remaster of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, &quot;&quot; introduced unlockable information terminals which play a series of motion comics narrated by Guilty Spark. The terminals detail Guilty Spark&#x27;s time on Installation 04 during his long millennia of isolation from his perspective and provide some background information on the Forerunners and the Halo installations they built, as well as teasing story details for &quot;Halo 4&quot;.

===&quot;Halo 2&quot;===

343 Guilty Spark makes a return in &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Following the destruction of Installation 04, Guilty Spark travels to a Forerunner gas-mining facility in the atmosphere of the gas-giant Threshold, which Installation 04 orbited. On it, he meets a Covenant Elite named Sesa &#x27;Refumee and discloses the purpose of the Halo Array to him. Realizing that the &quot;Great Journey&quot; the Covenant Prophets speak of is the extermination of the entire galaxy, &#x27;Refumee rebels against the Covenant. When the Arbiter is sent to kill the &quot;Heretics&quot;, he is engaged by the Sentinels and encounters Guilty Spark, whom he refers to as the Oracle to the robot&#x27;s chagrin. Once the Heretic leader is dead, the Brute Tartarus arrives and captures Guilty Spark. The Covenant Hierarchs use Guilty Spark to find out how to activate Delta Halo (Installation 05). With Delta Halo&#x27;s Index secured, Tartarus and Guilty Spark take a captured Miranda Keyes — whom they need for activating the ring — to the ring&#x27;s control room, where they are confronted by the Arbiter and his new ally, Avery Johnson. In the ensuing struggle, Keyes is able to stop the firing of Delta Halo, but Guilty Spark informs them that since the rings in the Halo Array were unexpectedly shut off, failsafe protocols have begun and that all remaining rings can be activated remotely from a place called the Ark.

The 2014 anniversary remake of &quot;Halo 2&quot; also features unlockable information terminals which play motion comics when activated. Some of the comics follow Guilty Spark&#x27;s conversations with Sesa &#x27;Refumee, which are additional content absent from the original release of &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

===&quot;Halo 3&quot;===

Guilty Spark appears once more in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Halo 3&quot; saving the Master Chief from a Flood form. He claims that all of his pre-programming has been rendered useless now that his installation is destroyed, and promises to help the Master Chief in any way as the Chief is still a Reclaimer – according to Spark, humanity is, in fact, descended from the Forerunner. Guilty Spark repairs the message Cortana left on a Flood-controlled ship, and tags along with the humans and Elites who head through a slipspace portal which leads to the Ark. Here, Guilty Spark leads the Master Chief and allies through the installation. After the Prophet of Truth is killed, Guilty Spark reveals that construction of a &quot;new&quot; Halo is underway to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed. When Sergeant Avery Johnson attempts to fire the ring prematurely, Guilty Spark fatally wounds Johnson with an energy beam shot from his eye to stop him from destroying both the Installation and the Ark. Guilty Spark claims ownership of the fledgling installation and is determined to protect it and the Ark from the premature firing, forcing the Master Chief to destroy Guilty Spark to activate the installation and stop the Flood once and for all.

=== In other media===
Guilty Spark appears in the novels &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Forerunner Saga&quot; series of novels, &quot;Halo: Renegades&quot; and &quot;Halo: Point of Light&quot;. The character&#x27;s voice actor, Tim Dadabo, serves as the narrator of the audiobook edition of &quot;Halo: Primordium&quot;, the second novel in &quot;The Forerunner Saga&quot; by Greg Bear.

In the 2003 novelization of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the Master Chief observes that artificial intelligences like Guilty Spark often gain behavioral &quot;quirks&quot; after an extended period of time in operation, where they inevitably enter a rogue state of mind called &quot;rampancy&quot;. In &quot;Primordium&quot;, Spark, who survived his apparent destruction in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, is picked up by the Office of Naval Intelligence research team of the &quot;UNSC Rubicon&quot;. It is eventually revealed that he was originally a human being named Chakas who was digitized by the Forerunners at the expense of his biological form after he suffered mortal injuries. As Chakas and later Monitor Chakas as he was originally known, Spark had a major role in the events surrounding the end of the Forerunner-Flood war, but his memories were blocked when he became the Monitor of Installation 04 at which time his name was changed to 343 Guilty Spark. Having recovered his sanity, memories and much of his original human personality, he is left horrified by what he became as a Forerunner Monitor. After his debriefing by ONI, Guilty Spark takes over the systems of the Rubicon and sets sail, trying to find the Librarian, or what remains of her.

In &quot;Renegades&quot;, after crashing on a desolate, isolated planet, he is picked up by the salvage crew of the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. Now choosing to be known simply as &quot;Spark&quot;, he allies with the crew to recover their stolen property from ONI who are after the AI as well and to complete his own mission of finding the Librarian. Succeeding in both, Spark is talked out of his original plan by the Librarian and made to recognize the friends he has made among the crew. Given a coordinate key to &quot;the safe place&quot; by the Librarian and inhabiting the body of a Forerunner armiger robot by the events of &quot;Renegades&quot;, Spark helps his friends to escape ONI and offers his services to the crew as the shipboard AI for the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; which Spark greatly upgrades using Forerunner technology. The crew dedicates themselves to finding the long-lost &quot;Spirit of Fire&quot; while the Librarian indicates to Captain Lucy Orion &quot;Rion&quot; Forge that Spark, who she calls singularly unique due to his ability to evolve so greatly on his own over time, may still have an important role to play in the events to come.

In &quot;Point of Light&quot;, occurring around the same time as &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, Spark and Rion search for the mysterious Forerunner planet Bastion while Spark struggles with his purpose. After finding Bastion, a Forerunner shield world and the Librarian&#x27;s secret laboratory, Spark agrees to become its caretaker, feeling that he doesn&#x27;t belong in the past or the present. As a final gift to his friends, Spark provides Niko and Leesa with gifts to further their future endeavors and repairs the Forerunner AI Little Bit to replace him as the shipboard AI of the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. In his final transmission to Rion, Spark uses the image of his original human self Chakas and departs to parts unknown with Bastion to keep it out of the hands of Cortana and her Guardians.

Guilty Spark is included as part of the &quot;Halo&quot; Mashup DLC pack for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One editions of &quot;Minecraft&quot;, and is available as a customization option for car antennae in the Xbox One edition of &quot;Rocket League&quot;. The character has been featured as part of the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise&#x27;s line of merchandise.

In the season 2 finale of the &quot;Halo&quot; television series, 343 Guilty Spark interrogates the Master Chief after he lands on Installation 04. Warning the Master Chief that &quot;it&quot; is waiting for him deeper in the ring, Spark departs, promising to observe what comes next.

==Influences and analysis==

In her book &quot;Godwired: Religion, Ritual and Virtual Reality&quot;, Heather Wagner suggested that the name Guilty Spark evokes quasi-Gnostic religious themes. The number &quot;343&quot; is the result of seven times seven times seven; it has been suggested that the number seven has a special significance to the original developers of &quot;Halo&quot; as it is frequently referenced within the context of the game universe, and that number three is also used when a significant plot point is being signaled.

Guilty Spark&#x27;s role in the &quot;Halo&quot; series is cited as an example of a trend in video games where technology, not angels, is cast as an agent of revelation. In his book &quot;Halo and Philosophy: Intellect Evolved&quot;, Luke Cuddy suggested that &quot;Halo&#x27;s&quot; handling of artificial intelligence shows that modern society more commonly associates the idea of revelation with technology than with divine forces, and that belief in God is unnecessary in order to long for understanding of the human situation since humanity&#x27;s belief in the divine is in some ways being implanted by &quot;faith&quot; in technology. He compared Spark&#x27;s role in disclosing the truth of the Halo installations to several major characters to that an angel: an otherworldly guide and mediator who escorts visionaries through potentially treacherous otherworldly terrain, interprets what they see so that it could be passed down as privileged information, and provides reassurance of a higher purpose on the face of the apocalypse. Spark&#x27;s dialogue also represents the &quot;demythifying&quot; power of naturalistic explanation, because he debunks the erroneous religious beliefs and superstitions of the Covenant faction – that the Forerunners are divine beings, that he is an &quot;oracle&quot; who provides divine revelation, and that the Halo installations are instruments of eternal salvation – with factual information.

Cuddy also suggested that Guilty Spark&#x27;s unconventional behaviour speaks to an intelligence that thinks very differently compared to the other characters or factions in the series. He contrasted the character&#x27;s priorities with that of the Master Chief and Cortana, as he appears to be in shock and disbelief that they would consider destroying the &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; and its extensive records of human history but is prepared to scour the galaxy of all sentient life via the activation of the Halo installations without hesitation, noting that the character considers the existing humans to be less real and less worthy of study, categorization and preservation then the digital artifacts left behind by their ancestors.

Commenting on his role as an instrument for character development, Tom Chick from &quot;GamePro&quot; drew attention to a climactic moment at the end of the Library level where the Master Chief is depicted as &quot;the dim and well-intentioned warrior dude whose shrill female consciousness had to whip him into shape&quot;, musing that &quot;there&#x27;s something delightfully domestic about how Cortana can&#x27;t believe how dumb and trusting he is&quot; of a &quot;funny little robot&quot; who led him on &quot;like the soldier he is&quot;, and that he &quot;blindly followed Guilty Spark&#x27;s instructions, carrying the key to the ignition, perfectly willing to turn it and therefore activate the Halo and wipe out all life in the galaxy&quot;, all the while being unaware of the Halo installation&#x27;s true purpose until Cortana&#x27;s intervention. He called it the &quot;Halo&quot; series&#x27; most human moment and a contrast to the Master Chief&#x27;s portrayal as an infallible war hero in later sequels.

Charlie Barratt from &quot;Gamesradar&quot; identified Guilty Spark as a frenemy of the Master Chief due to his constant shifting allegiances during the &quot;Halo&quot; trilogy, noting that he is programmed by the Forerunners to activate and protect Halo structures when necessary, only siding with certain characters when their objectives align out of coincidence.

== Reception and legacy ==
Guilty Spark has received a mixed reception from critics and players. Luke Plunkett from &quot;Kotaku&quot; called the character a &quot;floaty little machine whose sole purpose is to hover around&quot; and annoy the player. Jeff Marchiafava from &quot;Game Informer&quot; called Guilty Spark a &quot;jerk&quot; due to his recurring acts of betrayal. Ron Whitaker from &quot;The Escapist&quot; included Guilty Spark in his list of terrible video game villains; Whitaker conceded that while Guilty Spark is not bad as a comic relief character, he drew an unfavourable comparison to Wheatley from &quot;Portal 2&quot; and expressed disappointment that Spark turned out to be the final boss of &quot;Halo 3&quot;, opining that the gameplay experience felt anticlimactic as a result. George Reith from &quot;Gamingbolt&quot; criticized the character&#x27;s appearance and design, claiming that Apple would have &quot;come up with some kind of organizational and multimedia device that looks exactly like 343 Guilty Spark&quot; by the 2020s. Michael Swaim from &quot;IGN&quot; discussed Guilty Spark and the Forerunners in his 2020 article, &quot;3 Great Gaming Villains Whose Plans Make No Sense&quot;, where he criticized their motivations and actions in the series as contrived and laden with plot holes. Dadabo has acknowledged negative reception to his character during interviews, and is aware that a significant portion of the &quot;Halo&quot; fandom considers Guilty Spark to be an annoying character.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameinformer-downes/dadabo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, 343 Guilty Spark has been described as a &quot;loveable little genocidal robot&quot; and a &quot;fan-favorite&quot;. The Australian edition of &quot;GameSpot&quot; considered Guilty Spark to be a significant character of the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, being one of its &quot;most humorous, enigmatic, and—ultimately—lethal foes&quot;. Chick opined that the character is &quot;a great variation on the friendly droid/rogue AI trope&quot;. Cuddy singled out Guilty Spark and Cortana as the most fully developed of the characters in the &quot;Halo&quot; series, and called them the bright spots in &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; where an immersive but superficial science fiction game world is presented. &quot;GameDaily&quot; called the character an &quot;evil mastermind&quot; and compared him to HAL-9000 from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, another initially genial AI entity who eventually turns on its human associates. Ashton Raze from &quot;The Telegraph&quot; included Guilty Spark in his list of gaming&#x27;s greatest robot characters. Guilty Spark was the most requested &quot;Halo&quot; character by fans for &quot;Minecraft&quot; Mashup DLC. A select few single player campaign levels from &quot;&quot;, where Guilty Spark plays a pivotal narrative role, have been praised by various sources to be among the best campaign levels in the &quot;Halo&quot; series: &quot;343 Guilty Spark&quot; and &quot;The Library&quot; in &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, and &quot;Halo&quot; in &quot;Halo 3&quot;.

The current developers responsible for the &quot;Halo&quot; video game franchise and a subsidiary studio of Xbox Game Studios based in Redmond, Washington, were named 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) after the character. A Halloween pumpkin carving contest named &quot;343 Guilt O&#x27;Lantern&quot; was organized annually by Halo.Bungie.Org from 2004 until 2016; both the contest&#x27;s title and logo used the character&#x27;s design and name as inspiration. Video game journalists have recognized the similarity of Guilty Spark&#x27;s design aesthetics to that of the Ghost, robotic companions to player character Guardians in the &quot;Destiny&quot; video game franchise, as among the most recognizable elements taken from the &quot;Halo&quot; series by Bungie.

<doc id="615147" wikidata="Q2938945" url="?curid=615147" title="Carl Hubbell">
<text>Carl Owen Hubbell (June 22, 1903 – November 21, 1988), nicknamed &quot;the Meal Ticket&quot; and &quot;King Carl&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball player. He was a pitcher for the New York Giants of the National League from 1928 to 1943, and remained on the team&#x27;s payroll for the rest of his life, long after their move to San Francisco.

Twice voted the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, Hubbell was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. During 1936 and 1937, Hubbell set the major league record for consecutive wins by a pitcher with 24. He is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1934 All-Star Game, when he struck out five future Hall of Famers – Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin – in succession. Hubbell&#x27;s primary pitch was the screwball.

==Early years==
Hubbell was born in Carthage, Missouri, to Margaret Dell (née Upp) and George Owen Hubbell, and was one of seven children. He was raised in Meeker, Oklahoma, where he attended Meeker High School.

After graduating from high school, Hubbell worked for an oil company and played for their baseball team which encouraged him to play professionally.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Hubbell began his baseball career in the Oklahoma State League, in 1923. In 1925, he went 17–13 with the Oklahoma City Indians of the Western League with his trademark screwball; as a result, he was signed by the Detroit Tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926. However, pitching coach George McBride and player-manager Ty Cobb wanted him to scrap the screwball due to fears of injuries. For the rest of spring training, without his pitch, Hubbell was ineffective.

He was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League before the start of the season and was forbidden from throwing the screwball. Without his signature pitch, Hubbell went a mediocre 7–7 on a championship team and was demoted to the Decatur Commodores of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League after spring training 1927. Despite a 14–7 record, the Tigers didn&#x27;t invite him back for 1928, and he was sent to the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League.

Hubbell was so fed up by this time that he told Beaumont manager Claude Robinson that he would retire and go into the oil business unless he was sold to another organization by the end of the season. Years later, he said that being unloaded by the Tigers was the best thing that ever happened to him.

Hubbell&#x27;s break came that June, when Giants scout Dick Kinsella decided to take in a game between Hubbell&#x27;s Exporters and the Houston Buffs while in Houston for the 1928 Democratic National Convention. He had not planned on doing any scouting, but was impressed by Hubbell. Kinsella called Giants manager John McGraw and mentioned that he knew of Hubbell&#x27;s release by Detroit, prompted in part by Cobb&#x27;s concerns about the screwball. McGraw replied that Christy Mathewson had a screwball (a fadeaway, as it was called in his time) and it did not seem to affect his arm. Kinsella followed Hubbell for a month and was still impressed.

===New York Giants (1928–1943)===
Hubbell would go 10–6 in his first major league season and would pitch his entire career for the Giants. With a slow delivery of his screwball, Hubbell recorded five consecutive 20-win seasons for the Giants (1933–37) and helped his team to three NL pennants and the 1933 World Series title. In the 1933 Series, he won two complete game victories, including an 11-inning 2–1 triumph in Game Four (the run was unearned). In six career Series starts, he was 4–2 with 32 strikeouts and a low 1.79 earned run average. Hubbell finished his career with a 253–154 record, 1677 strikeouts, 724 walks, 36 shutouts and a 2.98 ERA, in 3590 innings pitched.

As a hitter, Hubbell posted a .191 batting average (246-for-1288) with 95 runs, 30 doubles, 4 home runs, 101 RBI and 33 bases on balls. In six World Series appearances, he batted .211 (4-for-19) with 1 run and 1 RBI. Defensively, he recorded a .967 fielding percentage.
Hubbell won 24 consecutive decisions between 1936 (16) and 1937 (8), the longest such streak ever recorded in major league history. He was twice named National League MVP (1933, 1936) (1st unanimous MVP pick in 1936). He led the league in wins 3 times in 1933 (23), 1936 (26), and 1937 (22). Hubbell led the league in ERA three times in 1933 (1.66), 1934 (2.30), and 1936 (2.31). He led the league in innings pitched in 1933 (308). He led the league in strikeouts in 1937 (159). He led the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 1938 (5.23). He led the league in shutouts in 1933 (10). He led the league in saves in 1934 (eight, retroactively credited). He compiled a 46 consecutive scoreless innings streak and four shutouts in 1933. He pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates (11–0, May 8, 1929). He pitched an 18-inning shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals (1–0, July 2, 1933).

In its 1936 World Series cover story about Lou Gehrig and Carl Hubbell, &quot;Time&quot; depicted the Fall Classic that year between crosstown rivals Giants and Yankees as &quot;a personal struggle between Hubbell and Gehrig&quot;, calling Hubbell &quot;...currently baseball&#x27;s No. 1 Pitcher and among the half dozen ablest in the game&#x27;s annals.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; said that while he was growing up on his family&#x27;s Missouri farm, he &quot;practiced for hours...throwing stones at a barn door until he could unfailingly hit knotholes no bigger than a dime&quot;.

Hubbell was released at the end of the 1943 season. He had posted a 4–4 record that year, marking the only time he did not record double-digit wins. However, Giants owner Horace Stoneham immediately appointed him as director of player development, a post he held for 35 years. During that time, he lived in Haworth, New Jersey; he continued to live there after the Giants left New York. The last ten years of his life were spent as a Giants scout. At the time of his death, he was one of the last New York Giants still active in some capacity in baseball, the last player from the McGraw era who was still active in the game, and one of the last living members of the franchise from McGraw&#x27;s time.

==All-Star Game record==
In the 1934 All Star Game played at the Polo Grounds, Hubbell produced one of baseball&#x27;s most memorable moments by striking out five future Hall of Famers in succession: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin. In 1984, the 50th anniversary of this legendary performance, Hubbell was on hand for the 1984 All-Star Game at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park to throw out the first pitch, which was a screwball.

==Personal life==
Hubbell was married to Lucille &quot;Sue&quot; Harrington (1905–1967) from 1930 until her death. They had two children: Carl Jr. (born 1936) and James. Carl Jr. had a brief career in the lower minor leagues and later was a career officer in the United States Marine Corps.

Hubbell suffered a stroke while driving near his home in Mesa, Arizona, on November 19, 1988, that caused him to lose control of his car and crash into a lamppost. He was taken to a hospital in Scottsdale, where he died of blunt force injuries two days later. He is interred at Meeker-Newhope Cemetery in Meeker, Oklahoma. His death came exactly 30 years after that of his teammate Mel Ott, who likewise died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident.

==Baseball honors==

Hubbell was a nine-time All-Star, having been honored each year from 1933 to 1938 and then again from 1940 to 1942. In 1999, he ranked number 45 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Hubbell was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. He was the first NL player to have his number (11) retired. His number is posted on the facing of the upper deck in the left field corner at Oracle Park. In 1981, Hubbell received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Hubbell appeared as himself in the movie &quot;Big Leaguer&quot;, and was one of the players mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

<text>The Yao people () or Dao () is a classification for various ethnic minorities in China and Vietnam. Their majority branch is also known as Mien. They are one of the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China and reside in the mountainous southwest and south of the country. They also form one of the 54 ethnic groups officially recognized by Vietnam. They numbered 2,796,003 in the 2010 Chinese census and 891,151 in the 2019 Vietnamese census. An estimated 60,000 Yao of the Iu Mien branch reside in the United States, mostly in the Western coastal states.

==History==
===China===
The origins of the Yao can be traced back two millennia to Hunan around the Dongting Lake region. According to a Yao tale, the Chinese Emperor Gao Xin was saved from an enemy chieftain by his faithful dog, Pan Hu. As a reward, Pan Hu was turned into a man and given the emperor&#x27;s daughter in marriage. The descendants of the two became the Yao people. This tale was used as a basis for their connection to the Mo Yao, a group of highlanders who were exempt from forced labour during the Tang dynasty (618-907). Between 200 BCE and 900 CE, the Yao migrated into mountainous areas to the south of the Yangtze River. 

The Yao were conquered by the Han Chinese between the 900s and 1200s. However they were covered under a loose reign system known as the Jimi system or Tusi. The local chieftains collected tribute and taxes from their own people and paid taxes to the emperor.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, rule over the Yao was tightened. Ming and Qing authorities sent in their own bureaucrats to directly collect taxes, supplanting the role of the Yao chieftains. The Yao and Miao people were among the rebels during the Miao Rebellions against the Ming dynasty during the 1370s and 1449. Conflict drove the Yao further south into the highlands between Hunan and Guizhou to the north and Guangdong and Guangxi to the south, and stretching into Eastern Yunnan. Some left for Southeast Asia. 

Around 1890, the Guangdong government started taking action against Yao in Northwestern Guangdong.

After the Mao Zedong&#x27;s Communist Party won the civil war in the late 1940s, the Yao benefited greatly from the ideology of equality and were able to access education, becoming part of the regional and national elite. They were often recruited as specialists to assist with the ethnic identification program within the framework of a large unified China.

===Laotian Civil War===
During the Laotian Civil War, the Yao tribes of Laos had a good relationship with U.S. forces and were dubbed to be an &quot;efficient friendly force&quot;. They fought in favour of the (South Vietnamese) government against the communists. This relationship caused the new communist Laotian government to target Yao tribal groups once the war was over. This triggered further immigration into Thailand, where the tribes would be put into camps along the Thailand-Laos border.

===Immigration to the United States===
After obtaining refugee status from the Thai government, and with the help of the United Nations, many Yao people were able to obtain sponsorship into the United States (although many remain in Thailand). Most of the Yao who have immigrated to the United States have settled along the Western part of the US, mainly in central and northern California such as Visalia, Oakland, Oroville, Redding, Richmond, Sacramento, but also in parts of Oregon like Portland, Salem, and Beaverton as well as the state of Washington in Seattle and Renton. See Mien American for those identified as Mien.

==Culture, society, and economy==

Yao society is traditionally patrilineal, with sons inheriting from their fathers. The Yao follow patrilocal residence. Polygyny was allowed until it was banned in China in the 1950s. Adoption was common among the wealthy. 

The Yao people have been farmers for over a thousand years, mostly rice cultivation through plowing, although a few practice slash-and-burn agriculture. Where the Yao live nearby forested regions, they also engage in hunting.

During the Southern Song (1127–1279), an imperial Chinese observer, Zhou Qufei, described the Yao as wearing distinctive fine blue clothing produced using indigo.

The Yao celebrate their &quot;Pan Wang&quot; (King Pan) festival annually on the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month. The festival celebrates the mythical original story of the Yao people, and has evolved &quot;into a happy holiday for the Yao to celebrate a good harvest and worship their ancestors.&quot;

==Religion==

The description of Yao religion is similar to the definition of Chinese folk religion as described by Arthur Wolf and Steve Sangren. Like the Han, the Yao engage in patrilineal ancestor worship, celebrate lunar new year, and recognize a set a 18 gods and goddesses, mostly of Han Chinese origin. The Yao had shaman priests as part of their community who engaged in activity such as exorcism, spiritual communication, and divination using chicken bones or bamboo sticks.

Taoism has historically been important to the Yao. Jinag Yingliang, in a 1948 study, argued that Yao religion was characterized by (1) a process of Han Chinese-influenced Daoisation (); (2) the endurance of pre-Daoist folk religion; and (3) some Buddhist beliefs.

Scholar Zhang Youjun takes issue with claims of &quot;strong Buddhist influence&quot; on the Yao, arguing that &quot;although Yao ritual texts contain Buddhist expression, the Yao do not believe in Buddhism at all. They are resolutely Taoist.&quot;

==Groups and languages==

There are several distinct groups within the Yao nationality, and they speak several different languages, The Iu Mien comprise 70% of the Yao population.
* Hmong–Mien languages
**The Mien speak Mienic languages (), including:
*** Mian–Jin languages
**** Iu Mien, 2,172,000 speakers (1,699,750 in China, 350,000 in Vietnam, 40,000 in Thailand, 20,250 in Laos, 60,000 in the United States, 2,000 in France) 
**** Kim Mun (also known as Lanten), more than 300,000 Yao people 
**** Biao Mon, 20,000 speakers 
*** Dzao Min, 60,000 speakers 
*** Biao Min, 43,000 speakers
** Hmongic languages
*** Bunu languages
*** Pa-Hng
*** Younuo
*** Kiong Nai
* Lakkja language (a Tai–Kadai language)
* Chinese
** about 500,000 Yao speak Chinese dialects

In addition to China, Yao also live in northern Vietnam (where they are called &quot;Dao&quot;), northern Laos, and Myanmar. There are around 60,000 Yao in northern Thailand, where they are one of the six main hill tribes. The lowland-living Lanten of Laos, who speak Kim Mun, and the highland-living Iu Mien of Laos are two different Yao groups. There are also many Iu Mien Americans, mainly refugees from the highlands of Laos. The Iu Mien do not call themselves &quot;Yao&quot;. Not all &quot;Yao&quot; are Iu Mien. A group of 61,000 people on Hainan speak the Yao language Kim Mun; 139,000 speakers of Kim Mun live in other parts of China (Yunnan and Guangxi), and 174,500 live in Laos and Vietnam.

The Bunu people call themselves &quot;Nuox&quot; , &quot;Buod nuox&quot; , &quot;Dungb nuox&quot; , or their official name &quot;Yaof zuf&quot; . Only 258,000 of the 439,000 people categorised as Bunu in the 1982 census speak Bunu; 100,000 speak the Tai–Kadai Zhuang languages, and 181,000 speak Chinese and the Tai–Kadai Bouyei language.

==Written languages==
After 1982, the Guangxi Nationality Institute and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences together created a new Yao writing system which was unified with the research results of the Yao-American scholar Yuēsè Hòu (Traditional Chinese: 約瑟·候/Simplified Chinese: 约瑟·候). The writing system was finalized in 1984 in Ruyuan County (乳源瑤族自治縣), Guangdong, which included Chinese professors Pan Chengqian (盤承乾/盘承乾), Deng Fanggui (鄧方貴/邓方贵), Liu Baoyuan (劉保元/刘保元), Su Defu (蘇德富/苏德富) and Yauz Mengh Borngh; Chinese government officials; Mien Americans Sengfo Chao (Zhao Fuming), Kao Chiem Chao (Zhao Youcai), and Chua Meng Chao; David T. Lee.

American linguist Herbert C. Purnell developed a curriculum and workshop presentations on language learning in East and Southeast Asia, as well as Yao Seng Deng from Thailand. The US delegation took the new writing system to the Iu Mien community in the United States where it was adopted with a vote of 78 to 7 by a conference of Mien American community leaders.
This writing system based on the Latin alphabet was designed to be pan-dialectal; it distinguishes 30 syllable initials, 121 syllable finals and eight tones.

For an example of how the unified alphabet is used to write Iu Mien, a common Yao language, see Iu Mien language.

There is a separate written standard for Bunu, since it is from the Hmong/Miao side, rather than the Mien/Yao side, of the Miao–Yao language family.

Some people think that a variety of Yao is, or was, written in Nüshu, an indigenous script in Southern part of Hunan Province in China. But this connection between Yao language and Nüshu is disputed, because Nüshu more likely recorded local Chinese dialect which might be also known by Yao people in Hunan.

Officially, illiteracy and semi-literacy among the Yao in China still stood at 40.6% in 2002.

<text>David Gary Neeleman (born October 16, 1959) is a Brazilian-American businessman and entrepreneur. He has founded five commercial airlines: Morris Air, WestJet, JetBlue Airways, Azul Brazilian Airlines, and Breeze Airways. Along with Humberto Pedrosa and Aigle Azur, he owned 45% of TAP Air Portugal. In 2017 he became a citizen of Cyprus.

==Biography==
Neeleman was born in São Paulo, Brazil, and raised in Sandy, Utah. He lived in Brazil until he was five.

His grandfather John Neeleman was born in Utah to Dutch immigrants and owned nine convenience stores.

==Career==
He co-founded (with June Morris) Morris Air, a low-fare charter airline, and from 1984 to 1988, he was the executive vice president of the company. 

In 1988, Neeleman assumed the helm of Morris Air as its president. In 1993, when Morris Air was acquired by Southwest Airlines for $130 million (Neeleman received $25 million from the sale), he worked for five months on their Executive Planning Committee.

After leaving Southwest, Neeleman became the CEO of Open Skies, a touch screen reservation and check-in systems company, later acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1999. At the same time, he helped to found two new airlines, WestJet and NewAir, which later became JetBlue.

As the CEO of JetBlue Airways, his 2002 salary was $200,000 with a bonus of $90,000. Neeleman donated his entire salary to the JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund, which was established for JetBlue employees who had fallen on hard times.

On May 10, 2007, Neeleman was replaced by David Barger as CEO of JetBlue and, on May 21, 2008, he was replaced as chairman of the board by Joel Peterson.

On March 27, 2008, Neeleman officially announced plans to launch a new airline, Azul (Portuguese for &quot;blue&quot;), a domestic carrier in Brazil. Azul completed 2013 with over 5 Billion (BRL) in sales and is currently Brazil&#x27;s largest airline.

On October 30, 2013, Neeleman and his youngest brother, Mark James Neeleman, a co-founder of Azul, announced the launch of a new company, Vigzul, a home security and monitoring company. Vigzul came from an idea of Mark Neeleman and was founded by David Allred, Brett Chambers and Neeleman serves as chairman of the board and principal investor.

In June 2015, the Portuguese Government decided to sell the TAP Air Portugal Group, owner of the national air carrier, TAP Air Portugal, to Atlantic Gateway, a joint venture of venture between Neeleman and Portuguese entrepreneur Humberto Pedrosa; Atlantic Gateway took control of 61% of the capital of the Portuguese carrier, and promised to maintain Portugal as the airline&#x27;s main hub for a minimum of 30 years. In July 2020 the Portuguese state increased its stake to 72.5 %. It acquired this stake from Atlantic Gateway, which now holds 22.5%.

===New US startup===
In June 2018, he announced plans for a new US airline called Breeze Airways for which he raised $100m capital. On July 17, 2018, Breeze Airways signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 60 A220-300 aircraft to be delivered beginning in 2021.

===COVID-19 controversy===
Neeleman was a critic of COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2020, he funded a study by John Ioannidis to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County, California. Ioannidis, a physician and Stanford University professor, was also a prominent opponent of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ioannidis did not initially disclose his funding from Neeleman, thus creating a potential conflict of interest.

==Personal life==
Neeleman, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, served a two-year mission in Brazil when he was 19.
He has been diagnosed with ADHD. He is the father of 10 children with his former wife, Vicki Vranes. The couple has since divorced.

His brother, Stephen Neeleman, a general and trauma surgeon, was one of the founders of the American health care company HealthEquity. His nephew by his sister, Lisa, is Denver Broncos quarterback Zach Wilson. His son, Daniel Neeleman, and daughter-in-law, Hannah Neeleman, run the social media account Ballerina Farm. 

Neeleman was the 2005 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his contributions in the commercial aviation industry. He speaks fluent Portuguese and holds citizenships of Brazil, U.S. and Cyprus.

<doc id="615165" wikidata="Q132925" url="?curid=615165" title="Brodiaeoideae">
<text>Brodiaeoideae are a monocot subfamily of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, order Asparagales. They have been treated as a separate family, Themidaceae. They are native to Central America and western North America, from British Columbia to Guatemala. The name of the subfamily is based on the type genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot;.

In molecular phylogenetic analyses, Brodiaeoideae is strongly supported as monophyletic. It is probably sister to Scilloideae. Recent treatments have divided Brodiaeoideae (or Themidaceae) into 12 genera. The monophyly of several of the genera remains in doubt. As currently circumscribed, the largest genera are &quot;Triteleia&quot;, with 15 species, and &quot;Brodiaea&quot;, with 14. Nine of the 12 genera are known in cultivation, but only species of &quot;Brodiaea&quot; and &quot;Triteleia&quot; are commonly grown.

==Description==
The following description is derived from two sources.

Perennial herbs arising from a starchy corm; a new corm arising each year from the old one.

Leaves linear, often fleshy, forming a closed sheath at their base. Veins parallel.

Inflorescence an umbel, or rarely a single flower, at the apex of a solitary scape. Flowers bisexual, actinomorphic. Tepals all similar, in 2 whorls of 3.

Fertile stamens 6, or 3 and alternating with 3 staminodes. Stamens and staminodes inserted on tepals. Anthers basifixed and introrse.

Ovary superior and trilocular.

Fruit a loculicidal capsule. Seed covered with phytomelan.

==History==
For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, when the group was recognized at all, it was usually at tribal rank and usually called Brodiaeeae. Most authors assigned it to Liliaceae, Alliaceae, or Amaryllidaceae. In 1985, Dahlgren, Clifford, and Yeo treated it as tribe Brodiaeeae of Alliaceae.

Toward the end of the 20th century, it became increasingly evident that the heterogeneous Liliaceae recognized by most authors was several times polyphyletic and that &quot;Brodiaea&quot; and its relatives were closer to Asparagus than to &quot;Allium&quot; or &quot;Amaryllis&quot;. For these reasons, the family Themidaceae was resurrected in an article in Taxon in 1996. The name &#x27;Themidaceae&#x27; was first used by Richard Salisbury in 1866. The name was based on the now-defunct genus &quot;Themis&quot;, which was established by Salisbury along with the family. The only species ever assigned to &quot;Themis&quot; was &quot;Themis ixioides&quot;. Its name was changed to &quot;Brodiaea ixioides&quot; by Sereno Watson in 1879, then to &quot;Triteleia ixioides&quot; by Edward Lee Greene in 1886. It is known as &quot;Triteleia ixioides&quot; in Flora of North America.

When the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published the APG II system in 2003, Themidaceae was treated as an optional circumscription for those who thought that Asparagaceae sensu lato should be divided into smaller segregate families. When the APG III system was published in 2009, Themidaceae was not accepted. In an accompanying article, it was treated as Brodiaeoideae, one of 7 subfamilies in Asparagaceae.

==Genera==
According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website , the genera included in the subfamily are:
* &quot;Androstephium&quot; 
* &quot;Bessera&quot; (including &quot;Behria&quot;)
* &quot;Bloomeria&quot; 
* &quot;Brodiaea&quot; 
* &quot;Dandya&quot; 
* &quot;Dichelostemma&quot; (including &quot;Brevoortia&quot;, &quot;Dipterostemon&quot;, &quot;Stropholirion&quot;)
* &quot;Milla&quot; (including &quot;Diphalangium&quot;)
* &quot;Muilla&quot; 
* &quot;Petronymphe&quot; 
* &quot;Triteleia&quot; (including &quot;Hesperoscordium&quot;, &quot;Themis&quot;)
* &quot;Triteleiopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Xochiquetzallia&quot;

<doc id="615166" wikidata="Q832250" url="?curid=615166" title="Elf (band)">
<text>Elf was an American rock band founded in 1967 by singer and bassist Ronnie James Dio, keyboardist Doug Thaler, drummer Gary Driscoll, and guitarists Nick Pantas and David Feinstein (Dio&#x27;s cousin). The band was originally called the Electric Elves, but was shortened to the Elves in 1968 and finally Elf in 1972. Elf disbanded in 1975 after recording three albums and after most of the lineup had been absorbed into the newly formed Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow.

==History==
The band was formed in 1967 when the members of Ronnie Dio and the Prophets transformed themselves into the Electric Elves and added a keyboard player, Doug Thaler.

In February 1968, the band was involved in an automobile accident which claimed the life of Nick Pantas. The accident forced a shuffling of the band member roles as original keyboardist Thaler moved to guitar (after recovering from his injuries) and the group hired Mickey Lee Soule to take over keyboard duties. Upon leaving the group in 1972, Thaler moved to New York and got a job as a booking agent — Elf was one of the bands he booked.

Elf&#x27;s self-titled debut album was produced by Deep Purple members Roger Glover and Ian Paice, who happened to see Elf auditioning in 1972. For the next few years, the band enjoyed mild success as an opening act for Deep Purple.

Dio both sang and played the bass guitar until, following the release of Elf&#x27;s first album, Craig Gruber was asked to join as bass guitarist. In August 1973 Feinstein quit the band and was replaced by Steve Edwards. In 1974, Elf released its second album, &quot;Carolina County Ball&quot;. That same year Dio was asked by Glover to sing on his solo album, &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;. Dio&#x27;s voice gained the attention of Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, who was beginning to tire of Deep Purple and was looking for musicians to record a solo album. Asides guitarist Steve Edwards and drummer Mark Nauseef, he decided in early 1975 to use the musicians in Elf for this album, and the band Rainbow was soon formed. Though Elf had been writing and recording its third album, &quot;Trying to Burn the Sun&quot; at the same time, following the completion of that album and the Rainbow album, Elf was no more. &quot;Trying to Burn the Sun&quot; was eventually released in the U.S. in June 1975.

In 1980, Feinstein formed the heavy metal power trio The Rods.

Beginning in the late 1980s, some of the former members of Elf speculated about a potential reunion of the band, however nothing formal ever took place. Three of the band&#x27;s members have also died: Driscoll in 1987, Dio in 2010, and Gruber in 2015.

Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; remarked that Modest Mouse show influence from Pixies and Jane&#x27;s Addiction. with certain elements on the album also drawing comparisons to Built to Spill and Pink Floyd.

Lyrically, many of the album&#x27;s tracks focus on traveling by automobile and the loneliness associated with rural life.

<text>The TI-84 Plus is a graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments which was released in early 2004. There is no original TI-84, only the TI-84 Plus, the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition models, the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, the TI-84 Plus CE, and TI-84 Plus CE Python. The TI-84 Plus is an enhanced version of the TI-83 Plus. The key-by-key correspondence is relatively the same, but the TI-84 features improved hardware. The archive (ROM) is about 3 times as large, and the CPU is about 2.5 times as fast (over the TI-83 and TI-83 Plus). A USB port and built-in clock functionality were also added. The USB port on the TI-84 Plus series is USB On-The-Go compliant, similar to the next generation TI-Nspire calculator, which supports connecting to USB based data collection devices and probes, and supports device to device transfers over USB rather than over the serial link port. It is also able to connect to a special TI application for calculator screenshots and image download. 

==Versions==

=== TI-84 Plus Silver Edition ===
The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition was released in 2004 as an upgrade to the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition. Like the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, it features a 15 MHz Zilog Z80 processor and 24 KB of user-available RAM. The chip has 128 KB, but Texas Instruments has not made an OS that uses all of it. Newer calculators have a RAM chip that has only 48 KB. All calculators with the letter H or later as the last letter in the serial code have fewer RAM pages, causing some programs to not run correctly. There is 1.5 MB of user-accessible Flash ROM. Like the standard TI-84 Plus, the Silver Edition includes a built-in USB port, a built-in clock, and assembly support. It uses 4 AAA batteries and a backup button cell battery. The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition comes preloaded with a variety of applications. These programs are also available for the TI-84 Plus, but some must be downloaded separately from TI&#x27;s website. It is manufactured by Kinpo Electronics.

TI offers a special yellow version of the TI-84 Plus, inscribed with the words &quot;School Property&quot;, for schools to loan out to students. This special design was produced in an effort to combat theft. Owners can buy other interchangeable colored face-plates and slide-cases online. A kickstand-style slide case and other accessories are also available.

In 2011, TI launched the TI-84 Pocket.fr, a miniaturized version of the TI-84 Plus for the French market. In 2012, TI launched the TI-84 Plus Pocket SE, a miniaturized version of the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition for the Asian market.

In 2015, Texas Instruments released the TI-84 Plus T in the Netherlands. This model is very similar to the original TI-84 Plus, but features an LED to indicate whether or not the calculator is in Exam Mode. The hardware of the TI-84 Plus T is similar to the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, with ninety-six 16 KB pages of archive memory, for a total of 1540 KB. However, unlike the TI-84 Plus, the TI-84 Plus T does not allow users to execute assembly programs. The TI-84 Plus T has 2 different Exam Modes available with different levels of restrictiveness. The most restrictive level does not allow for any existing programs to be accessed, and does not allow any new programs to be created. This mode makes the LED blink green. The second, more moderate Exam Mode is the same, apart from three additional applications being allowed (PlySmlt2, Inequalz and Conics). This mode makes the LED blink orange.

=== TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition ===
The TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition was released in 2013 as the first Z80-based Texas Instruments graphing calculator with a color screen. It had a 320×240-pixel full-color screen, a modified version of the TI-84 Plus&#x27;s 2.55MP operating system, a removable 1200 mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and keystroke compatibility with existing math and programming tools. It had the standard 2.5 mm I/O (DBUS) port and a mini-USB port for connectivity and charging. The calculator was praised for its high-resolution (relative to contemporary graphing calculators) color screen, which allowed new pedagogical approaches such as graphing multiple functions together in different colors. It was widely criticized for its slow performance by educators and hobbyists/hackers alike; the performance was attributed to the calculator retaining its monochrome predecessors&#x27; CPU to drive a screen displaying 300 times as much image information. Nonetheless it demonstrated the value of a color-screen TI-84 Plus-family calculator and was superseded two years later by the TI-84 Plus CE which was embraced by the calculator hobbyist community. Notable third-party milestones included overclocking the device from 15 MHz to 22 MHz and the third-party Doors CS shell.

=== TI-84 Plus CE and TI-84 Plus CE-T ===
The TI-84 Plus CE (known as the TI-83 Premium CE in France) was publicly previewed by TI Education in January 2015 and released in 2015. The calculator retains the 320×240-pixel color screen, rechargeable battery, and key layout of the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, while removing the 2.5 mm I/O (&quot;DBUS&quot;) linkport and moving the USB port and charging LED to the right side of the handheld. The calculator&#x27;s OS 5.x is incompatible with the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition&#x27;s hardware. In addition, the RSA signing key length has been increased to 2048 bits, making infeasible previous efforts to unlock the calculator to unrestricted third-party software development. The calculator has 154 KB of user-accessible RAM and 3.0 MB of Archive memory. It uses the eZ80 processor from Zilog, making all Z80 assembly programs from the previous TI-84 Plus series calculators incompatible. The CE was introduced in multiple colors (Classic (black), Silver Linings, Radical Red, True Blue, Denim (navy blue), Lightning (light blue), Plum Pi (purple); Positively Pink (as of March 2015), Golden Ratio, and Bright White (as of June 2016) were added later), and further colors have since been released. Like the rest of the TI-84 Plus series, certain countries permit its use in examinations. The calculator comes programmed with seven different languages (English, French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish).

In 2016, the TI-84 Plus CE-T was released for the European educational market. The only significant difference from the CE model is the addition of an LED that blinks while the calculator is in Press-to-Test mode.

CE calculators in hardware revisions M and later (which were manufactured starting May 2019) have a revamped PCB and contain an improved architecture, with caching with a more recent flash chip (Winbond 25Q32JVSIQ), compared to previous revisions (up to L), which contained a Winbond W29GL032C. Due to this change, these more recent revisions have seen a significant improvement in overall speed.

In 2020, TI Education announced its decision to remove support for assembly and C programming on these calculators in response to a video posted on YouTube detailing how to bypass the test mode on OS version 5.2.2. TI&#x27;s response was widely considered unnecessary, and led to anger from users. The changes are reflected in OS version 5.5.1 for the European models and OS version 5.6 for the US models. Currently, an exploit called ArTIfiCE has been released that allows for native code execution through a bug in the CabriJR app.

=== TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition and TI-84 Plus CE Python ===
The TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition was released in 2021 and provides OS version 5.6 and above with the ability to program the calculator in Python and includes a preloaded bundle of applications. The Python implementation is extremely slow compared to NumWorks and HP calculators due to the use of an ARM coprocessor running CircuitPython, which communicates to the calculator via 115200 baud UART serial. In the North American market, the TI-84 Plus CE Python replaced the existing TI-84 Plus CE in 2021.

Around 2021, Texas Instruments removed the charging light to simplify and reduce costs (notably on the black model).

==Software==
There are three different types of programs which can be downloaded or programmed into the calculators: TI-BASIC, Z80 assembly language, and Flash applications (also written in Z80 assembly). The TI-84 Plus CE is different in that programs are written in TI-BASIC, eZ80 assembly language, or in the C programming language. In addition, there are programs available that are able to compile or interpret other programming languages. The TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition supports the Python programming language. Also, there are several languages developed by community members for the calculators, notably ICE, which is for the TI-84 Plus CE, and Axe, which is for the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus SE. There are a wide range of applications that this produces, including science classes, games, calculus, and note taking (when put together with a separately sold keyboard).

The TI-84 Plus series is exactly like its predecessor in that it can be used on the SAT and ACT examinations as well as International Baccalaureate examinations. However, in some cases those administering the exam may reset the calculator&#x27;s memory beforehand to prevent cheating through the use of built-in programs or other data.

When OS 2.30 was initially released, users noticed the speed of graphing was greatly reduced. The explanation was that the update added asymptote checking in graphing.

In January 2006, Texas Instruments released v2.40 of the operating system for the TI-84 Plus series. The most noticeable addition to the new OS was the &quot;Press-To-Test&quot; feature that allowed a teacher to disable any programs installed on the calculator, so they cannot be used on tests, etc.

As of OS version 2.53MP which was released in February 2010, support was added for prettyprinted expressions. However, some programs stopped working correctly in this OS version, or were running slower. The current OS version is 2.55MP, which was released in January 2011.

In July 2009, a community-made patch was released which allowed user-made operating systems to be easily uploaded onto the TI-84 Plus series. Shortly after the patch was developed, the RSA keys for the calculator&#x27;s operating system were factored via the General number field sieve (GNFS) algorithm, making a software patch unnecessary. In response to this, Texas Instruments released a newer hardware revision which only accepts other, stronger RSA keys, making it harder to load user-made operating systems or older TI operating systems (2.53MP and earlier). The community has found a way around the newest limitation by discovering a way to revert to older versions of the boot code.

The TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition supports using CircuitPython, a Python 3 variant, developed by Adafruit. Only the math and random modules are initially supported, but it is possible that wider support will become available either from TI or from the community.

Critics point out that the basic design of the TI-84 has not changed since it was released in 2004, contrary to the trend of rapid design change occurring in other areas of electronics manufacturing.

==Programming==
The TI-84 Plus is based heavily on its predecessor, the TI-83 Plus. As with all other calculators in the series, the TI-84 Plus supports native Z80 assembly as well as TI&#x27;s interpreted, BASIC-like language for calculators, dubbed TI-BASIC. Programming for the TI-84 Plus is nearly identical to programming for the TI-83 Plus, with a few new functions in both TI-BASIC and the calculator&#x27;s assembly support that do not exist on earlier models and OS versions. Several attempts have been made at creating a C to Z80 assembler, such as SDCC.

The TI-84 Plus CE series can be programmed in TI-BASIC, eZ80 assembly, or with the C programming language. To aid in programming, a USB keyboard can be attached to the TI-84 Plus CE via a USB On-The-Go adapter.

In 2021, the TI-84 Plus CE Python Edition was released, which supports native Python programming via an ARM coprocessor. An app was made to add functionality to the software.

The TI-84 Plus series calculators&#x27; dialect of TI-BASIC is the same as that of the TI-83 Plus series, but with a few more commands including ones for date and time, and colors.

On 20 May 2020, Texas Instruments revealed that support of assembly and C programming would be removed starting in OS version 5.5.1 for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI-83 Premium CE. 4 months later, a jailbreak called arTIfiCE, which exploits the application Cabri Jr. to run arbitrary code, was written that restored compatibility.

== Connection Software ==
The TI-Connect software for older calculators was phased out in favor of TI-Connect CE, which works on TI-84, TI-84 Plus C, and TI-84 Plus CE. It supports loading bundles of files, multi-device syncing and exam mode deployment, along with the ability to send OS updates to multiple calculators at the same time, and a built-in IDE for TI-BASIC programming.

<doc id="615170" wikidata="Q1578699" url="?curid=615170" title="Macintosh XL">
<text>Macintosh XL is a modified version of the Apple Lisa personal computer made by Apple Computer. In the Macintosh XL configuration, the computer shipped with MacWorks XL, a Lisa program that allowed 64 K Macintosh ROM emulation. An identical machine was previously sold as Lisa 2/10 with the Lisa OS only.

==Hardware==
Macintosh XL has a 400K 3.5&quot; floppy drive and an internal 10 MB proprietary &quot;Widget&quot; hard drive with provision for an optional 5 or 10 MB external ProFile hard drive with the addition of a parallel interface card. The machine uses a Motorola 68000 CPU, clocked at 5 MHz together with 512 KB RAM. Macintosh XL was discontinued in April 1985.

===Upgrades===
Because of its roots as a Lisa — unlike all other Macintosh computers — the stock Macintosh XL used rectangular pixels. The resolution of Macintosh XL&#x27;s 12-inch (30.5 cm) display was 720×364 pixels. Square pixels were available through the Macintosh XL Screen Kit upgrade that changed the resolution to 608×432 pixels. The CPU could be replaced with a new CPU board containing up to 8 MB RAM, called &quot;XLerator 18&quot;. The maximum upgraded RAM with conventional add-in RAM cards was up to 2 MB – quadruple the maximum capacity of earlier Macintosh computers. With modifications to the CPU board, the XL could accommodate up to 4 MB of RAM.

==MacWorks==
MacWorks Plus was developed by Sun Remarketing as a successor to MacWorks XL in order to provide application compatibility with the Macintosh Plus computer. MacWorks Plus added support for an 800 KB 3.5&quot; floppy disk and System software up through version 6.0.3. MacWorks Plus II extended that to the same System 7.5.5 limit imposed on all 68000 processors.

==History==

After two years of lackluster sales, Apple attempted to salvage Lisa by redesigning some hardware components and renaming it as Macintosh XL. Basing on the previous sale figures of Lisa, Apple ordered the limited number of parts as to last through 1985 before ending the production. The redesign spurred a record number of orders for this addition to the Macintosh line, which caught Apple off-guard.

===Discontinuation===
Due to the limited number of parts ordered, Apple had sold its entire allocations of Macintosh XL for 1985 much earlier than anticipated. Had Apple continued to manufacture Macintosh XL as to meet the demand at lower price, the company would have lost even more money on each unit. Additionally, the cancellation was also due to the necessary consolidation of expenses and projects. In 1986, Apple offered an exchange program for the owners of Lisa and Macintosh XL: The owners could exchange their Lisa and Macintosh XL along with $1,495 US for the new Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk 20 (list price of $4,098 US).

===Sun Remarketing===
After Apple dropped the XL from their price list in September 1985, Sun Remarketing of Logan, Utah, bought a number of Apple&#x27;s remaining inventory and continued to sell them under license with their updated version of MacWorks Plus, re-branding it as Macintosh Professional.

Although no new Lisas were available for sale, development continued on MacWorks Plus to support the installed base of Lisas, making them as relevant as their closely related cousin Macintosh Plus.

===Legacy===
Macintosh XL shares the same legacy as Lisa before it. However, the increased sales from the emulation of the Macintosh operating system proved that the Macintosh family badly needed a more professional environment which could support larger monitors, greater memory, and more expandability than Macintosh 512K offered.

<doc id="615184" wikidata="Q988557" url="?curid=615184" title="Either/Or (album)">
<text>Either/Or is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. &quot;Either/Or&quot; was recorded in several locations, mostly in Portland, Oregon – while Smith was still a member of Heatmiser – and was produced by Smith, Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf. &quot;Either/Or&quot; was released on February 25, 1997, on the Kill Rock Stars record label, following Heatmiser&#x27;s dissolution. Promoted with two singles, &quot;Speed Trials&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot;, &quot;Either/Or&quot; did not chart in the US, but was acclaimed by critics.

Director Gus Van Sant was highly impressed with the album, incorporating three of its songs; &quot;Between the Bars&quot;, &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot; along with a new song, &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, into the &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Miss Misery&quot; was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1998 Academy Awards, and was performed at the televised ceremony in an abridged version by Smith, backed by the house orchestra, briefly propelling him into the international spotlight. In 2020, the album was ranked at 216 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

== Recording ==
&quot;Either/Or&quot; was recorded at several locations: Joanna Bolme&#x27;s house; Smith&#x27;s own house; Undercover, Inc.; Laundry Rules Recording; and the Heatmiser House – all in Portland, Oregon – as well as The Shop in Arcata, California. The album was produced by Smith, Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf.

Smith wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;Either/Or&quot; during the sessions for this album, but it was not included on the final release; however, the song was later included on &quot;New Moon&quot;, a posthumous compilation of previously unreleased material by Smith.

== Content ==
The album&#x27;s title derives from the Søren Kierkegaard book of the same name, in which &quot;either/or&quot; refers to the contrast between aesthetic/subjective experience and ethical/objective being. This existential title is reflective of Smith&#x27;s interest in philosophy, which he studied at Hampshire College in Massachusetts.
The lyrics contain many references to Portland such as the neighborhood of Alameda, Division Street and the Portland Rose Festival.

The album&#x27;s style has been described as &quot;a bridge between the lo-fi darkness of &quot;Roman Candle&quot; and &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; and the studio sheen of &quot;XO&quot; and &quot;Figure 8&quot;.&quot;

== Release ==
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Speed Trials&quot;, was released on October 1, 1996.

&quot;Either/Or&quot; was released on February 25, 1997. It did not chart in the US. The album&#x27;s second and final single, &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot;, was released on June 29, 1998.

Smith would briefly be cast into the international spotlight early the following year when he performed his song, the 1997 standalone single &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony, following the song&#x27;s appearance in the major motion picture &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and its subsequent Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. Following this appearance, Smith was signed to major label DreamWorks and started work on his fourth studio album, &quot;XO&quot;.

As of March 2017, &quot;Either/Or&quot; is Elliott Smith&#x27;s best selling release (it still has never charted) and has sold 429,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Either/Or&quot; was critically acclaimed. Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the album &quot;marks something of a thematic transition&quot; for Smith, noting &quot;brightness and a pop feel&quot; on &quot;Either/Or&quot; in contrast to the &quot;stark, guy-with-acoustic-guitar confessionals about drug abuse and darkness&quot; on &quot;Elliott Smith&quot;. It was voted the 20th best album of 1997 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. The poll&#x27;s supervisor, Robert Christgau, was less enthusiastic about the album, finding Smith &quot;tuneful if depressive&quot; and believing that, &quot;he could too be popular—he just doesn&#x27;t want to be, that&#x27;s all&quot;.

In its retrospective review, &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; opined: &quot;Simply put, the songs on &quot;Either/Or&quot; are Elliott Smith&#x27;s best&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called it &quot;even more fully realized&quot; than &quot;Elliott Smith&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The album inspired Gus Van Sant to invite Smith to contribute to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Three &quot;Either/Or&quot; tracks were incorporated into the soundtrack, as well as a new song, &quot;Miss Misery.&quot; Smith was briefly pushed to the forefront of popular culture after performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; from &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. Van Sant later also used &quot;Angeles&quot; in his 2007 film &quot;Paranoid Park.&quot; The song was again featured in the 2020 series &quot;Normal People&quot;.

Online magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Either/Or&quot; 59th in its list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1990s. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked &quot;Either/Or&quot; at number 48 on its list of the best albums from 1987 to 2012. &quot;Blender&quot; ranked it thirty-sixth in its &quot;100 Greatest Indie Rock Albums Ever&quot; list. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Either/Or&quot; at number 149 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked the album No. 97 on their list of best albums ever. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at 216 on the 2020 re-release of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album #23 on its best albums of the decade list (2022). The restaurant Either/Or, in Portland, Oregon, references the album&#x27;s title.

<doc id="615193" wikidata="Q359994" url="?curid=615193" title="Adobe Atmosphere">
<text>Adobe Atmosphere was a software platform for interacting with 3D computer graphics. 3D models created with the commercial program could be explored socially using a browser plugin available free of charge. Atmosphere was originally developed by Attitude Software as 3D Anarchy and was later bought by Adobe Systems. The product spent the majority of its lifetime in beta testing. Adobe released the last version of Atmosphere, version 1.0 build 216, in February 2004, then discontinued the software in December that year.

==Features==
Atmosphere focused on explorable &quot;worlds&quot; (later officially called &quot;environments&quot;), which were linked together by &quot;portals&quot;, analogous to the World Wide Web&#x27;s hyperlinks. These portals were represented as spinning squares of red, green, and blue that revolved around each other and floated above the ground. Portals were indicative of the Atmosphere team&#x27;s desire to mirror the functionality of Web pages. Although the world itself was described in the codice_1 (or codice_2) file, images and sounds were kept separately, usually in the GIF, WAV or MP3 format. Objects in worlds were scriptable using a specialized dialect of JavaScript, allowing a more immersive environment, and worlds could be generated dynamically using PHP. Using JavaScript, a world author could link an object to a Web page, so that a user could, for example, launch a Web page by clicking on a billboard advertisement (Ctrl+Shift+Click in earlier versions). By version 1.0, Atmosphere also boasted support for using Macromedia Flash animations and Windows Media Video as textures.

Atmosphere-based worlds consisted mainly of parametric primitives, such as floors, walls, and cones. These primitives could be painted a solid color, given an image-based texture, or made &quot;subtractive&quot;. Invisible, &quot;subtractive&quot; primitives could be used to cut &quot;holes&quot; in other primitives, to build more complex shapes. Many worlds also contained animated polygon meshes made possible by Atmosphere&#x27;s implementation as a subcomponent of Viewpoint Corporation&#x27;s Viewpoint Media Player. However, Viewpoint stopped supporting the Atmosphere subcomponent some time before Atmosphere was discontinued.

Unlike the more centralized structure of Active Worlds, in which environments are primarily built within &quot;AlphaWorld&quot;, Atmosphere worlds were spread throughout the Internet, usually hosted on the author&#x27;s own Web site as codice_1 files. There were binary and ASCII versions of the codice_1 file format, though the ASCII format was phased out in later releases. codice_1 files could be generated dynamically using server-side content management systems, as demonstrated by the AtmoWorlds.com Worlds Directory.

Users were represented in worlds by avatars. In later builds, an option allowed the user to see his or her own avatar. An early quirk of Atmosphere displayed users whose avatars had not yet loaded as colorful, slanted cylinders, and announced the arrival of users with a &quot;bug zapper&quot; sound.

Whereas in ActiveWorlds it is only possible to communicate with users within a 200-meter radius, Atmosphere users could chat with all the users in the world. This model was more appropriate for Atmosphere, considering the smaller sizes of most worlds. Technically, users could chat with anyone in the same YACP &quot;channel&quot;, a reference to the IRC protocol (see below). The exception was when worlds would receive too many visitors, as was often the case at &quot;HomeWorld&quot;: worlds would &quot;clone&quot;, creating duplicate channels for the same world, which would often cause confusion for users. Some world developers wrote scripts that limited communication to users within a certain distance, for greater realism.

A built-in Havok physics engine, detailed rendering, and dynamic lighting (with support for lighting effects like radiosity, distance fog, and glare) also contributed to the realism of Atmosphere worlds. Many world authors wanted to create large worlds, in order to build more realistic cities, for example, but such worlds would often take an excessive amount of time to load in the visitor&#x27;s web browser, especially if the visitor was using a slower dial-up connection. To alleviate this issue, Atmosphere supported a pattern reminiscent of inline frames in HTML: sections of the world – &quot;subworlds&quot; or &quot;models&quot; – would load as the user neared, so that a city could load block by block, rather than all at once. One of Atmosphere&#x27;s problems, however, was excessive memory usage, which was exacerbated by the use of advanced features such as embedded models and Flash movies in many worlds.

Atmosphere&#x27;s chat console used the Windows-1252 character encoding.

From its inception, Adobe Photoshop Album included a &quot;3D gallery&quot; feature that could publish a photo album as an Atmosphere world.

==History==

Adobe Atmosphere began as 3D Anarchy by Attitude Software. It originally relied on IRC for chat functionality. The original user interface was rather eccentric, featuring two ever-present eyeballs that would occasionally blink. Later versions adopted a more conventional interface, although one of the pre-supplied avatars was based on the eyes. Adobe bought the technology from Attitude in November 1999 and announced the first public beta version under the new name on March 26, 2001.

Atmosphere came as two stand-alone applications: the Builder, which was used to build online &quot;worlds&quot;, and the Player, which allowed users to explore these worlds. (In 3D Anarchy, these components were called Editor and Chat, respectively.) In addition to these applications, Adobe provided a browser plugin, to explore these worlds within a web browser, and a companion chat server called Adobe Community Server, which ran on an IRC-like protocol known as Yet Another Chat Protocol (YACP). During beta-testing, all three components of Atmosphere were available free of charge. Adobe distributed the server software under the &quot;Atmosphere Open Source License&quot;, a permissive open source license.

Beta versions of the Builder were notoriously unstable, and the program crashed so frequently that a user wrote a program that automatically saved worlds opened in the Builder at a fixed interval, preventing users from losing hours of work.

In August 2002, Adobe began to scrap the stand-alone Player, instead devoting more resources to develop the Atmosphere Plugin, which was at the time viewed as a buggy, less attractive alternative to the Player. The company&#x27;s focus on the Plugin was viewed as an attempt to compete with Flash before its developer, Macromedia, was purchased by Adobe. For the most part, the Plugin ran only on Internet Explorer for Windows, despite frequent requests by community members to expand Atmosphere support to Mozilla-based browsers, and to Linux and Mac OS. Unofficially, the plugin ran in Mozilla-based browsers with limited functionality. One user was able to run the stand-alone Player on Linux using Wine, albeit in a less-than-usable state.

As part of its efforts to garner commercial interest in the software, Adobe introduced support for embedding Atmosphere worlds into PDF documents for viewing in Acrobat Reader. The company also distanced Atmosphere from its reputation as a platform for online chat, by first disabling chat on the various official, Adobe-hosted worlds, then by deleting the worlds themselves.

Version 1.0 was released on October 22, 2003. At this point, Adobe decided to charge for the Builder, which was simply renamed Atmosphere, and continue to provide the Plugin and Server for free. As the beta-testing program ended, Adobe sent free copies of the Builder to registered beta-testers in late 2003 and early 2004 via Airborne Express and DHL. Following a long period of relative silence from the developers, Adobe announced in December 2004 that it would not continue development of the software. According to an FAQ from Adobe:

Adobe retains copyright on Atmosphere and does not give permission for others to distribute copies of the software, so the company&#x27;s decision to stop making the Builder available for purchase has essentially halted the creation of new worlds. The plugin remains available as a free download on Adobe&#x27;s FTP site, however. Adobe still provides 3D capabilities in its more popular Adobe Acrobat product, but these features were developed using technology from New Zealand&#x27;s Right Hemisphere, rather than using Atmosphere. Nearly all of the Atmosphere development team went on to work with the Acrobat team. The only Atmosphere component still in use at Adobe is the scripting API; other Atmosphere components including scene graphs and the physics engine were licensed from other companies, such as Viewpoint.

==Community==
Atmosphere had a dedicated beta-testing community, whose members constructed many worlds and avatars, promoted the software by word of mouth, and conducted community events, such as world tours and building contests. The largest of these contests was &quot;Star Wars 3D&quot;, a large-scale effort to create a comprehensive set of worlds and avatars based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. The creations were unveiled on July 4, 2003, and festivities officially continued until July 6. Another large effort held was themed to the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

Community members also organized and attended events such as &quot;World Tours&quot;, which featured innovative worlds each week, and &quot;Tech Talks&quot;, originally a weekly event intended for world and avatar developers. Initially, most community discussion occurred either in the worlds or at the appropriate Adobe User-to-User Forums. Later, to supplement the official Atmosphere product Web site and discussion forums, the community created a large number of resource Web sites, some of which are listed below.

Beta-testers dubbed the Atmosphere developers &quot;zombies&quot;, in recognition of the long hours the Adobe employees apparently spent developing the software. The running joke on the team was that, instead of the typical meal of brains, Atmosphere&#x27;s zombies ingested eyeballs, due to the visual nature of the product. The beta-testing community eagerly awaited new releases from the development team, to which the developers invariably answered that it would take &quot;about two weeks&quot;; this response became a euphemism for &quot;when it&#x27;s ready.&quot;

Despite the decentralized structure of Atmosphere and the popularity of the world-building contests, the Atmosphere community still preferred to gather in worlds created by Adobe and its partner DigitalSpace, such as Adobe&#x27;s annually-revamped &quot;HomeWorld&quot; and DigitalSpace&#x27;s &quot;Atmospherians Community&quot;. As the &quot;HomeWorld&quot; was the primary starting place for new users, the community found it easier to establish lively crowds there. When Adobe shut down &quot;HomeWorld&quot;, along with a number of other Adobe-hosted worlds, many builders made attempts at emulating the success of &quot;HomeWorld&quot; with their own starting points. However, without the constant stream of new users that &quot;HomeWorld&quot; experienced, most of these attempts failed to attract more than a small group of regulars.

Years after Adobe ended support for Atmosphere, some worlds remain online, though very few have been maintained and fewer still continue to support multi-user chat. Nonetheless, the software continues to enjoy a small fanbase that meets online each year on Halloween.

<doc id="615194" wikidata="Q2016847" url="?curid=615194" title="Oil Pollution Act of 1990">
<text>The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) was passed by the 101st United States Congress and signed by President George H. W. Bush. It works to avoid oil spills from vessels and facilities by enforcing removal of spilled oil and assigning liability for the cost of cleanup and damage; requires specific operating procedures; defines responsible parties and financial liability; implements processes for measuring damages; specifies damages for which violators are liable; and establishes a fund for damages, cleanup, and removal costs. This statute has resulted in instrumental changes in the oil production, transportation, and distribution industries.

==Background==
Laws governing oil spills in the United States began in 1851 with the Limitation of Liability Act. This statue, in an attempt to protect the shipping industry, stated that vessel owners were liable for incident-related costs up to the post-incident value of their vessel. The shortcomings of this law were revealed in 1967 with the release of over 100,000 tons of crude oil into the English Channel from the Torrey Canyon. Of the $8 million of cleanup-related costs, the owners of the Torrey Canyon were held liable for only $50—the value of the only remaining Torrey Canyon lifeboat. In the meantime, the Oil Pollution Act of 1924 had passed, but this statute only limited liability for &quot;deliberate&quot; discharge of oil into marine waters.

Two years following the Torrey Canyon spill, an oil platform eruption in the Santa Barbara Channel made national headlines and thrust oil pollution into the public spot light. As a result Congress placed oil pollution under the authority of the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 (later amended by the Clean Water Act in 1972). The 1970 law set specific liability limitations. For example, vessels transporting oil were liable only up to $250,000 or $150 per gross ton. These limitations rarely covered the cost of removal and cleanup, let alone damages.

In the decades to follow, several other laws that dealt with oil spill liability and compensation were passed. These statues include: the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973, the Deep Water Port Act of 1974, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1978, and the Alaska Oil Spill Commission of 1990. However, this fragmented collection of federal and state laws provided only limited safeguards against the hazards of oils spills. In 1976, a bill to create a cohesive safe measure for oil pollution was introduced to Congress. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate could agree on a single statue and the bill fell out of consideration numerous times.

On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in the Prince William Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil—the largest marine oil spill in recorded history up to that point. Soon afterward, in June 1989, three smaller spills occurred within coastal waters of the United States. This was timely evidence that oil spills were not uncommon.

Alaska Governor Steve Cowper authorized the creation of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission in 1989 to examine the causes of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and issue recommendations on potential policy changes. Cowper appointed Walter B. Parker, a longtime transportation consultant and public official, as the chairman of the commission. Under Parker, the Commission issued 52 recommendations for improvements to industry, state, and federal regulations. Fifty of these recommendations were worked into the Oil Pollution Act bill that was introduced into legislation on March 16, 1989, by Walter B. Jones, Sr., a Democratic Party congressman from North Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

==Enactment timeline==
* March 16, 1989: H.R. 1465, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, was introduced in the House of Representatives.
* June 21, 1989: The Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries reported the bill as amended.
* November 9, 1989: H.R. 1465 was passed by a vote in the House of Representatives.
* November 19, 1989: the bill was passed by the Senate, with revisions. The bill was sent back to the House of Representatives for approval of the changes added by the Senate. However, the House of Representatives did not agree to the revisions.
* August 2, 1990: a conference committee was created, including members of both the House of Representatives and Senate, in order to resolve differences and propose a final bill for approval. Initially, the Senate agreed to the committee&#x27;s final proposed report.
* August 4, 1990: both chambers of Congress had passed the bill in identical form. The final step in the legislative process was for the bill to go to the President to either approve and sign or veto it.
* August 18, 1990: the bill was signed by the President and the Oil Pollution Act was officially enacted.

==Enforcement==
A responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act is one who is found accountable for the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil from a vessel or facility into navigable waters, exclusive economic zones, or the shorelines of such covered waters. Responsible parties are strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of removing the oil in addition to any damages linked to the discharge. Unlike the liability for removal costs which are uncapped, liability for damages is limited as discussed in further detail below. Furthermore, the Oil Pollution Act allows for additional liability enacted by other relevant state laws.

Under the Oil Pollution Act, federal, tribal, state, and any other person can recover removal costs from a responsible party so long as such entity has incurred costs from carrying out oil removal activities in accordance with the Clean Water Act National Contingency Plan. Reimbursement claims must first be made to the responsible party. If the potentially responsible party refutes liability or fails to distribute the reimbursement within 90 days of the claim, the claimant may file suit in court or bring the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund described below. In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the responsible party. For example, claimants advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), governors of affected states and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that removal costs were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.

In a manner similar to that described above, costs for damages can be recovered from a responsible party. However, the Oil Pollution Act only covers certain categories of damages. These categories include: natural resource damages, damages to real or personal property, loss of subsistence use, loss of government revenues, loss of profits or impaired earning capacity, damaged public services, and damage assessment costs. Additionally, some categories are recoverable for any person impacted by the incident while others are only recoverable by federal, tribal, and state governments. Furthermore, the act proscribes limits to liability for damages based on the responsible party, the particular incident, and the type of vessel or facility from which the discharge occurred.

The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a trust fund managed by the federal government and financed by a per-barrel tax on crude oil produced domestically in the United States and on petroleum products imported to the United States for consumption. The fund was created in 1986, but use of the fund was not authorized until the Oil Pollution Act&#x27;s passage in 1990. The funds may be called upon to cover the cost of federal, tribal, state, and claimant oil spill removal actions and damage assessments as well as unpaid liability and damages claims. No more than one billion dollars may be withdrawn from the fund per spill incident. Over two decades of court cases have demonstrated that obtaining funding from the Oil Pollution Spill Liability Fund can be a difficult task.

==Concerns and reactions==
President Bush acknowledged the changes the world would have to endure when signing the Oil Pollution Act and as a result, he pushed the Senate to quickly ratify the new international protocols. The reactions from industries were negative. Industry objected that the act would hinder the free flow in the trade of imported oil in the Waters of the United States. Not only does the OPA impose restrictions on trading imported oil overseas, but it also implements the state oil liability and compensation statutes, which they view as further restricting free trade. After OPA was enacted, the shipping industry threatened to boycott the ports of the United States to protest this new industry liability in both federal and state laws. In particular, the oil and shipping industries objected to the inconsistency between the OPA and the international, federal and state laws that are impacted. As a result of the OPA enactment, certain insurance companies refused to issue certifications of financial liability under the act to avoid potential responsibility and compensation in the case of a disaster.

President Bush also predicted that the enactment of the OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spill disasters. Not just the oil industry, but also the vessel owners and operators would be held liable for an oil spill, facing a significant increase in financial responsibility. The OPA&#x27;s liability increase for vessel owners raised fears and concerns from the vast majority of the shipping industry. Vessel owners objected that additional oil spill penalties imposed by the states are free from OPA limitations of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States.

However, there were positive reactions from the oil industries despite the newly enforced codes and regulations. In 1990, the oil industry united to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), a non-profit corporation whose expenses would be compensated by the oil producers and transporters. The major MSRC responsibility was to develop new response plans for oil spills cleanups and for the OPA-required remediation. Shipping companies like the Exxon Shipping reacted positively to OPA&#x27;s efforts to reduce their risk of liability for oil spill disasters. To help ensure OPA compliance, Exxon Shipping compiled all state and federal regulations to which they must abide. Several independent and non-U.S. companies and operators, however, may avoid operations in the United States ports due to the OPA liability. Though the majority of elicited reactions and criticism from the enactment of OPA has been negative, it has nevertheless led to founding and designing safer requirements for ships and global oil trade.

==Long-term effects of OPA==
The Oil Pollution act imposes long-term impacts due to the potential for unlimited liability and the statute&#x27;s that hold insurers to serve as guarantors, which has ultimately resulted in the refusal of insurance companies to issue agreements of financial liability to vessel operators and owners. Thus, the inability to acquire proof of financial liability results in vessels not being able to legally enter waters of the United States. Since OPA does not exempt vessel creditors to enter U.S. waters, there is a disincentive for any lender to finance fleet modernization and or replacement. Lastly, OPA has the ability to directly impact the domestic oil production industry due to the rigorous offshore facility provisions.

# Financial responsibility: The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the implementation of the vessel provisions mandated by the Oil Pollution Act. Pursuant to the OPA, vessel owners need evidence of financial liability that covers complete responsibility of a disaster if their vessel weighs more than 300 gross tons. Vessel owners are required by OPA to apply to the Coast Guard to acquire a &quot;Certificate of Financial Responsibility&quot; that serves as proof of their ability to financially responsible for cleanup and damages of an oil spill. In the case of an uncertified vessel entering the waters of the United States, the vessel will have to be forfeited to the United States. This is not a new protocol because vessel owners were always mandated to acquire certificates under the Clean Water Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Since 2011, over 23,000 vessels have obtained the Coast Guard certificates to allow access to waters of the U.S.
# Disincentives for fleet replacement and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act holds the vessel owners fully liable, it has created a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse to pay more for higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer double hull tanker vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double-hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double hull tankers. Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still insufficient to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.
# Domestic production: In the Oil Pollution Act, the Coast Guard is in charge of screening the application process for vessels. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in the Department of the Interior implements and enforces all of the act&#x27;s regulations for offshore oil facilities. Under OPA, the responsible parties are mandated to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million for potential liability. If a party is unable to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million, they will be subject to pay a penalty of $25,000 per day in violation of OPA and may also be subject to judicial decision of terminating all operations.

Before enactment of the OPA, offshore facilities were required to provide evidence that declared financial responsibility of $35 million. Under OPA these offshore facilities had to increase their proof of financial responsibility by four times, and OPA&#x27;s requirement of financial responsibility expanded to include facilities in state waters as well. Facilities in state waters that are subject to the $150 million requirement includes pipelines, marina fuel docks, tanks, and oil production facilities that are located in, on, or under state coastal waters, and are adjacent to inland channels, lakes, and wetlands. The most evident impact of the enactment of OPA, is on the oil producers within the Gulf of Mexico. Many offshore facilities are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the marshes and wetlands of Louisiana. Major producers are most likely able to meet OPA&#x27;s requirement of financial responsibility, however, the major oil companies within the Gulf of Mexico have largely withdrawn the operation of their offshore facilities.

Due to environmental pressures and the restrictive governmental regulations enforced by OPA, substantial proposals of exploration and production in the United States have been withdrawn. As a result of major companies withdrawing their plans to drill, many smaller, independent producers had entered to make a profit. By October 1993, 93% of all oil and natural gas exploration and drilling were from independent producers. Of these new exploration projects, approximately 85% of drilling operations were in the Gulf of Mexico. The independent oil producers generated nearly 40% of the crude oil in the United States and 60% of domestic natural gas.

==International treaties==
In the case of oil pollution caused by other nations (especially ships), International treaties such as the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage which have a similar intention as the Act, have not been signed by the United States, as it was deemed the Oil Pollution Act provided sufficient coverage.

<text>Anthony Charles McPhee (23 March 1944 – 6 June 2023) was an English guitarist and singer. He was the founder of the British blues and rock band the Groundhogs.

== Career ==
McPhee was given the name &quot;T.S.&quot; — standing for &quot;Tough Shit&quot; — when he released a duet single with Champion Jack Dupree — titled &quot;Get Your Head Happy!&quot; — in 1966. Producer Mike Vernon suggested adding to McPhee&#x27;s name in order to make it look more like an official blues name.
The Groundhogs backed Dupree and John Lee Hooker on UK concerts in the mid-1960s. The band evolved into a blues-rock trio that produced three UK Top 10 albums in the UK in the early 1970s.

In 1973, McPhee released a solo album titled &quot;The Two Sides of Tony (T.S.) McPhee&quot;. Side A of this record is blues rock, and Side B is a single psychedelic art rock electronic composition in four movements, featuring Arp 2600 synthesizers, electric piano, and The Rhythm Ace drum synthesizer. Entitled &quot;The Hunt&quot;, it explores McPhee&#x27;s strong stance against fox and stag hunting. McPhee also released many other solo acoustic blues records, as well as duets with Jo Ann Kelly.

Apart from the Groundhogs, McPhee played with Herbal Mixture, the John Dummer Band, Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, Tony McPhee&#x27;s Terraplane, Tony McPhee&#x27;s Turbo, the Tony McPhee Band, and Current 93.

McPhee&#x27;s definitive biography, written by Paul Freestone, was published in 2012.

== Health issues and death ==
In 2009, McPhee suffered a stroke, which affected his speech and ability to sing.

McPhee died on 6 June 2023 of complications from a fall that occurred the previous year. He was 79.

<doc id="615202" wikidata="Q358502" url="?curid=615202" title="Kisho Kurokawa">
<text>(April 8, 1934 – October 12, 2007) was a leading Japanese architect and one of the founders of the Metabolist Movement.

== Biography ==

Born in Kanie, Aichi, Kurokawa studied architecture at Kyoto University, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1957. He then attended University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Kenzo Tange. Kurokawa received a master&#x27;s degree in 1959. Kurokawa then went on to study for a doctorate of philosophy, but subsequently dropped out in 1964. Kisho Kurokawa was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Architecture by the Chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia in Sept. 7, 2002.

With colleagues, he cofounded the Metabolist Movement in 1960, whose members were known as Metabolists. It was a radical Japanese avant-garde movement pursuing the merging and recycling of architecture styles within an Asian context. The movement was very successful, peaking when its members received praise for the Takara Cotillion Beautillion at the Osaka World Expo 1970. The group was dismantled shortly thereafter.
Kurokawa had a daughter, potter Kako Matsuura, and a son, photographer Mikio, from his first marriage to his college classmate. His second marriage was to actress Ayako Wakao (若尾 文子 Wakao Ayako), one of Japan&#x27;s biggest movie stars of the 20th century. Kurokawa&#x27;s younger brother works in industrial design but has also cooperated with Kurokawa on some architecture projects.

Kurokawa was the founder and president of Kisho Kurokawa Architect &amp; Associates, established 8 April 1962. The enterprise&#x27;s head office is in Tokyo with branch offices in Osaka, Nagoya, Astana, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Los Angeles. The company is registered with the Japanese government as a &quot;First Class Architects Office.&quot;

Although he had practiced the concept of sustainable and eco-minded architecture for four decades, Kisho Kurokawa became more adamant about environmental protection in his latter years. In 2007, he ran for governor of Tokyo and then for a seat in the House of Councillors in the 2007 Japanese House of Councillors election. Although not elected, Kisho Kurokawa successfully established the Green Party to help provide environmental protection. Also in 2007, Kurokawa created the structure of the Anaheim University Kisho Kurokawa Green Institute, which helps to develop environmentally-conscious business practices. Kurokawa was a stakeholder and founding Chair of the Executive Advisory Board of the Anaheim, California-based university since 1998 and his wife Ayako Wakao-Kurokawa serves as Honorary Chairman of the institute.

Kurokawa wrote extensively on philosophy and architecture and lectured widely. He wrote that there are two traditions inherent in any culture: the visible and the invisible. His work, he claimed, carried the invisible tradition of Japan. In 1972, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation to deliver a lecture at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

While Kurokawa&#x27;s architecture, particularly within Metabolism, does not explicitly follow traditional Japanese forms, some scholars argue that it retains elements of Japanese aesthetics. However, it is difficult to claim that the modern technologies and material he called on was inherited from the Japanese tradition and that the traditional forms of Japanese architecture can be recognized in his contemporary concrete or steel towers. Some architectural critics suggest that Kurokawa&#x27;s designs evolved from Japanese traditions, incorporating elements of Japanese aesthetics. His architecture focused on keeping traditional Japanese concepts invisible, especially materiality, impermanence, receptivity and detail. Kurokawa specifically referred to these four factors in his discussions of new wave Japanese Architecture.

He died of heart failure on October 12, 2007; he was 73.

== Key architectural concepts ==
=== Impermanence ===

Kurokawa noted that, with the exception of Kyoto and Kanazawa, most Japanese cities were destroyed during World War II. When Western cities are destroyed, brick and stone remained as proof of their past existence. Kurokawa noted that Japan&#x27;s cities, primarily built from wood and natural materials, were more susceptible to destruction by fire. He also noted that both Edo (now Tokyo) and Kyoto were almost entirely destroyed during several battles of the Warring States period in the 15th and 16th centuries. The shifting of power caused parts of Japan to be destroyed. On the same note, historically speaking, Japan&#x27;s cities have almost yearly been hit with natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods and volcanic eruptions. This continuous destruction of buildings and cities has given the Japanese population, in Kurokawa&#x27;s words, “an uncertainty about existence, a lack of faith in the visible, a suspicion of the eternal.”

In addition, the four seasons are very clearly marked in Japan, and the changes through the year are dramatic. Time, then, in Japanese culture is a precious entity that forces every candle, every being, every entity to fade at one point in time. The idea that buildings and cities should seem as natural as possible and that they should be in harmony with the rest of nature, since it is only temporarily there, helped create the tradition of making buildings and cities of “temporary” structure. 

This idea of impermanence was reflected in Kurokawa&#x27;s work during the Metabolism Movement. Buildings were built to be removable, interchangeable and adaptable. The concept of impermanence influence his work toward being in open systems, both in time and space.

=== Materiality ===

Kurokawa explains that the Japanese tried to exploit the natural textures and colors of materials used in a building. The traditional tea room was intentionally built of only natural materials such as earth and sand, paper, the stems and leaves of plants, and small trees. Trees from a person&#x27;s own backyard were preferred for the necessary timbers. All artificial colors were avoided, and the natural colors and texture of materials were shown to their best advantage. This honesty in materials stemmed from the idea that nature is already beautiful in itself. The Japanese feel that food tastes better, wood looks better, materials are better when natural. There is a belief that maximum enjoyment comes from the natural state.

Kurokawa&#x27;s designs often highlighted the natural properties of materials, a characteristic observed in his treatment of iron, aluminum, and concrete. The tradition of honesty of materiality is present in Kurokawa&#x27;s capsule building. In it, he showed technology with “no artificial colors.&quot; The capsule, escalator unit, elevator unit and pipe and ductwork were all exterior and exposed. Kurokawa opened structures and made no attempt to hide the connective elements, believing that beauty was inherent in each of the individual parts. This approach emphasized the exposure of materials, which some critics regard as an authentic representation of materiality in design. 

=== Receptivity ===
The notion of receptivity is a crucial Japanese idea—possibly a “tradition.&quot; Kurokawa stated that Japan is a small country. For more than a thousand years, the Japanese had an awareness of neighboring China and Korea and, in the modern age, Portugal, Great Britain and America, to name a few. The only way for a small country like Japan to avoid being attacked by these empires was to make continuous attempts to absorb foreign cultures for study and, while establishing friendly relations with the larger nations, preserve its own identity. This receptivity is the aspect that allowed Japan to grow from a farming island into an imperial nation, first using Chinese political systems and Chinese advancement, then Western techniques and knowledge. Japan experienced significant industrial and political changes, culminating in its involvement in World War II. Following the war, Japan incorporated elements of American culture and technology into its post-war rebuilding efforts.

Kurokawa’s architecture reflects elements of receptivity, and later works sought to establish a distinct architectural identity. At first, Kurokawa&#x27;s work followed the Modern Movement that was introduced in Japan by Tange, Isozaki and their peers. Tange showed the world that Japan could build modern buildings. His peers followed and continued the style. Then at one point in the 1960s, Kurokawa and a small group of architects began a new wave of contemporary Japanese architecture, believing that previous solutions and imitations were not satisfactory for the new era: life was not present in Modernism. They labeled their approach “metabolism.&quot; Kurokawa&#x27;s work became receptive “to his own philosophy, the Principle of Life.&quot; (He saw architecture and cities as a dynamic process where parts needed to be ready for change. He mostly used steel in open frames and units that were prefabricated and interchangeable.)

=== Detail ===
Kurokawa explained that the attention paid to detail in Japanese work derived essentially from the typical attempt to express individuality and expertise. In Japan the execution of details was a process of working not from the whole to the parts but from the parts to the whole. Every wood connection in a house was carefully crafted from the inside out. Japan is a country that moved from a non-industrial country to a fully industrial nation in less than 50 years, during the Meiji revolution. This sharp jump from producing goods by craftsmen to industrially realized production was so rapid that the deep-rooted tradition of fine craftsmanship as a statement of the creator did not disappear. As a result, the Japanese maker continues to be instilled with a fastidious preoccupation for fine details, which can be seen in contemporary architecture, art and industry. Some scholars argue that attention to detail is a significant aspect of traditional Japanese craftsmanship and design aesthetics.

Similarly, Kurokawa&#x27;s architecture features carefully detailed connections and finishes. He confessed: “This attention to detail is also an important key to understand my own architecture. The belief in the importance of details also suggests the new hierarchy.” Kurokawa believed that, while Western architecture and cities have been organized with a hierarchy from the infrastructure to the parts and details, his new approach to contemporary Japanese architecture focused on the autonomy of parts.

=== Sustainability ===
In 1958, Kisho Kurokawa predicted a “Transition from the Age of the Machine to the Age of Life,” and has continually utilized such key words of life principles as metabolism (metabolize and recycle), ecology, sustainability, symbiosis, intermediate areas (ambiguity) and Hanasuki (Splendor of Wabi) in order to call for new styles to be implemented by society. For four decades, Kisho Kurokawa created eco-friendly and sustainable architectural projects. In 2003 he was awarded the Dedalo-Minosse International Prize (Grand Prix) for his creation of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia and KLIA is the first and only airport in the world to receive the United Nations&#x27; Green Globe 21 certification for the airport&#x27;s commitment to environmental responsibility each year since 2004. 

=== Anaheim University Kisho Kurokawa Green Institute ===
The Anaheim University Kisho Kurokawa Green Institute was conceived of by Kisho Kurokawa and established in Kisho Kurokawa&#x27;s honor in 2008. The institute offers online Certificate, Diploma, Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) degree programs in Sustainable Management.

<doc id="615208" wikidata="Q271790" url="?curid=615208" title="Karen people">
<text>The Karen ( ), also known as the Kayin, Kariang or Kawthoolese, are an ethnolinguistic group of Tibeto-Burman language-speaking people. The group as a whole is heterogeneous and disparate as many Karen ethnic groups do not associate or identify with each other culturally or linguistically. 

These Karen groups reside primarily in Kayin State, southern and southeastern Myanmar. The Karen account for around 6.69% of the Burmese population. Many Karen have migrated to Thailand, having settled mostly on the Myanmar–Thailand border. A few Karen have settled in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, and other Southeast Asian and East Asian countries.

The Karen consist of two subgroups, the White Karen and the Red Karen. The Karen groups as a whole are often confused with the Padaung tribe, best known for the neck rings worn by their women, but they are just one sub-group of Red Karens (Karenni), one of the tribes of Kayah in Kayah State, Myanmar.

Karen insurgent groups, led primarily by the Karen National Union (KNU), have waged war against the Burmese government since early 1949. The original aim of the KNU was to create an independent Karen homeland called Kawthoolei, but since 1976 they have shifted towards calling for a federal system in Myanmar instead. Even so, the KNU has declined invitations to speak with the Burmese junta.

== Origins ==
Karen legends refer to a &quot;river of running sand&quot; which their ancestors reputedly crossed. Many Karen believe this refers to the Gobi Desert, although they have lived in Myanmar for centuries. Most scholars dismiss the notion of a Gobi desert crossing, but rather translate the legend as describing &quot;rivers of water flowing with sand&quot;. This could refer to the sediment-laden Yellow River of China, the upper reaches of which is considered to be the &quot;Urheimat&quot; of Sino-Tibetan languages. 

According to the legends, the Karen took a long time to cook shellfish at the river of flowing sand, until the Chinese taught the Karens to open the shells so as to acquire the meat. It is estimated by linguists Luce and Lehman that the Tibeto-Burman peoples such as the Karen migrated into present-day Myanmar between 300 and 800 CE.

&quot;Karen&quot; refers to a heterogeneous lot of ethnic groups that do not share a common language, culture, religion, or material characteristics. A pan-Karen ethnic identity is a relatively modern creation, established in the 19th century with the conversion of some Karen to Christianity and shaped by British colonial policies and practices.

&quot;Karen&quot; is an Anglicisation of the Burmese word &quot;Kayin&quot; (), whose etymology is unclear. The word may have originally been a derogatory term referring to non-Buddhist ethnic groups, or it may derive from &quot;Kanyan&quot;, a possibly Mon name of a vanished civilisation.

In pre-colonial times, the low-lying Burmese and Mon-speaking kingdoms recognised two general categories of Karen, the &quot;Talaing Kayin&quot; (), generally lowlanders who were recognised as the &quot;original settlers&quot; and essential to Mon court life, and the &quot;Karen&quot; (), highlanders who were subordinated or assimilated by the Bamar.

===Genetics===
Estimates suggest that the Karen began inhabiting what is now Myanmar approximately 2,500 years ago, migrating from regions that are now Mongolia and Tibet. They settled primarily in the hills bordering the eastern mountainous region of Myanmar. 

Research indicates that the Karen exhibit signs of genetic isolation, suggesting a distinct genetic lineage separate from neighboring populations. A study focusing on the Kayah (Red Karen) in Northern Thailand analyzed autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs) and Y-chromosomal haplogroups. The findings revealed that the Kayah people are genetically closer to other Southeast Asian populations than to those from Northeast Asia or Tibet.

== Distribution ==

The Karen constitute the third largest ethnic population in Myanmar, after the Bamars and Shans.
The Karen people live mostly in the hills bordering the eastern mountainous region and Irrawaddy delta of Myanmar, primarily in Kayin State (formerly Karen State), with some in Kayah State, southern Shan State, Ayeyarwady Region, Tanintharyi Region, Bago Division and in northern and western Thailand.

The total number of Karen is difficult to estimate. The last reliable census of Myanmar was conducted in 1931. A 2006 Voice of America article cites an estimate of seven million Karen in Myanmar. There are another 400,000 Karen in Thailand, where they are by far the largest of the hill tribes. Others live in refugee camps in Thailand.

Some Karen have left the refugee camps in Thailand to resettle elsewhere, including in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. In 2011, the Karen diaspora population was estimated to be approximately 67,000.

== Political history ==
=== British period ===
Following British victories in the three Anglo-Burmese wars, Myanmar was annexed as a province of British India in 1886. Baptist missionaries introduced Christianity to Myanmar beginning in 1830, and they were successful in converting many Karen. Christian Karens were favoured by the British colonial authorities and were given opportunities not available to the Burmese ethnic majority, including military recruitment and seats in the legislature. Some Christian Karens began asserting an identity apart from their non-Christian counterparts, and many became leaders of Karen ethno-nationalist organisations, including the Karen National Union.

In 1881 the Karen National Associations (KNA) was founded by western-educated Christian Karens to represent Karen interests with the British. Despite its Christian leadership, the KNA sought to unite all Karens of different regional and religious backgrounds into one organisation. They argued at the 1917 Montagu–Chelmsford hearings in India that Myanmar was not &quot;yet in a fit state for self-government&quot;. Three years later, after submitting a criticism of the 1920 Craddock Reforms, they won 5 (and later 12) seats in the Legislative Council of 130 (expanded to 132) members. The majority Buddhist Karens were not organised until 1939 with the formation of a Buddhist KNA.
In 1938 the British colonial administration recognised Karen New Year as a public holiday.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, when the Japanese occupied the region, long-term tensions between the Karen and Burma turned into open fighting. As a consequence, many villages were destroyed and massacres committed by both the Japanese and the Burma Independence Army (BIA) troops who helped the Japanese invade the country. Among the victims were a pre-war Cabinet minister, Saw Pe Tha, and his family. A government report later claimed the &quot;excesses of the BIA&quot; and &quot;the loyalty of the Karens towards the British&quot; as the reasons for these attacks. The intervention by Colonel Suzuki Keiji, the Japanese commander of the BIA, after meeting a Karen delegation led by Saw Tha Din, appears to have prevented further atrocities.

=== Post-war ===
The Karen people aspired to have the regions where they formed the majority turned into a subdivision or &quot;state&quot; within Myanmar similar to what the Shan, Kachin and Chin peoples had been given. A goodwill mission led by Saw Tha Din and Saw Ba U Gyi to London in August 1946 failed to receive any encouragement from the British government for any separatist demands.

In January 1947 a delegation of representatives of the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council headed by Aung San was invited to London to negotiate for the Aung San–Attlee Treaty, but none of the ethnic minority groups was included by the British government. The following month at the Panglong Conference, when an agreement was signed between Aung San as head of the interim Burmese government and the Shan, Kachin and Chin leaders, the Karen were present only as observers; the Mon and Arakanese were also absent.

The British promised to consider the case of the Karen after the war. While the situation of the Karen was discussed, nothing practical was done before the British left Myanmar. The 1947 Constitution, drawn without Karen participation due to their boycott of the elections to the Constituent Assembly, also failed to address the Karen question specifically and clearly, leaving it to be discussed only after independence. The Shan and Karenni states were given the right to secession after 10 years, the Kachin their own state, and the Chin a special division. The Mon and Arakanese of Ministerial Myanmar were not given any consideration.

=== Karen National Union ===
In early February 1947, the Karen National Union (KNU) was formed at a Karen Congress attended by 700 delegates from the Karen National Associations, both Baptist and Buddhist (KNA, founded 1881), the Karen Central Organisation (KCO) and its youth wing, the Karen Youth Organisation (KYO), at Vinton Memorial Hall in Yangon. The meeting called for a Karen state with a seaboard, an increased number of seats (25%) in the Constituent Assembly, a new ethnic census, and a continuance of Karen units in the armed forces. The deadline of 3 March passed without a reply from the British government, and Saw Ba U Gyi, the first president of the KNU, resigned from the Governor&#x27;s Executive Council the next day.

After the war ended, Myanmar was granted independence in January 1948, and the Karen, led by the KNU, attempted to co-exist peacefully with the Burman ethnic majority. Karen people held leading positions in both the government and the army. In the fall of 1948, the Burmese government, led by U Nu, began raising and arming irregular political militias known as &quot;Sitwundan&quot;. These militias were under the command of Major Gen. Ne Win and outside the control of the regular army. In January 1949, some of these militias went on a rampage through Karen communities.

The Karen National Union has maintained its structure and purpose from the 1950s onward. The KNU acts as a governmental presence for the Karen people, offering basic social services for those affected by the insurgency, such as Karen refugees or internally displaced Karen. These services include building school systems in Thailand and inside Burma, providing medical services, regulating trade and commerce, and providing security through the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), the KNU&#x27;s army.

=== Insurgency ===
In late January 1949, the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Smith Dun, a Karen, was removed from office and imprisoned. He was replaced by the Burmese nationalist Ne Win. Simultaneously a commission was looking into the Karen problem and this commission was about to report their findings to the Burmese government. The findings of the report were overshadowed by this political shift at the top of the Burmese government. The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO), formed in July 1947, then rose up in an insurgency against the government. They were helped by the defections of the Karen Rifles and the Union Military Police (UMP) units which had been successfully deployed in suppressing the earlier Burmese Communist rebellions, and came close to capturing Yangon itself. The most notable was the Battle of Insein, nine miles from Yangon, where they held out in a 111-day siege till late May 1949.

Years later, the Karen had become the largest of 20 minority groups participating in an insurgency against the military dictatorship in Yangon. During the 1980s, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) fighting force numbered approximately 20,000. After an uprising of the people of Myanmar in 1988, known as the 8888 Uprising, the KNLA had accepted those demonstrators in their bases along the border. The dictatorship expanded the army and launched a series of major offensives against the KNLA. By 2006, the KNLA&#x27;s strength had shrunk to less than 4,000, opposing what is now a 400,000-man Burmese army. However, the political arm of the KNLA – the KNU – continued efforts to resolve the conflict through political means.

The conflict continues , with a new KNU headquarters in Mu Aye Pu, on the Burmese–Thai border. In 2004, the BBC, citing aid agencies, estimates that up to 200,000 Karen have been driven from their homes during decades of war, with 160,000 more refugees from Myanmar, mostly Karen, living in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border. The largest camp is the one in Mae La, Tak province, Thailand, where about 50,000 Karen refugees are hosted.

Reports as recently as February 2010, state that the Burmese army continues to burn Karen villages, displacing thousands of people.
Many Karen, including people such as former KNU secretary Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan and his daughter, Zoya Phan, have accused the military government of Myanmar of ethnic cleansing. The U.S. State Department has also cited the Burmese government for suppression of religious freedom.

A 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on a report by Guy Horton into depredations by the Myanmar Army against the Karen and other groups in eastern Myanmar stated:

Using victims&#x27; statements, photographs, maps and film, and advised by legal counsel to the UN tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, he purports to have documented slave labour, systematic rape, the conscription of child soldiers, massacres and the deliberate destruction of villages, food sources and medical services.

==== Refugee crisis ====
Throughout the insurgency, hundreds of thousands of Karen fled to refugee camps while many others (numbers unknown) were internally displaced persons within the Karen state. The refugees were concentrated in camps along the Myanmar–Thailand border. According to refugee accounts, the camps suffered from overcrowding, disease, and periodic attacks by the Myanmar Army.

== Life in refugee camps ==
Around 400,000 Karen people are without housing, and 128,000 are living in camps on the Thailand-Burma border. According to BMC, &quot;79% of refugees living in these camps are Karen ethnicity.&quot; Their lives are restricted in the camps because they usually cannot go out, and the Thai police might arrest them if they do. Employment for the Karen refugees is scarce and risky. Former refugee Hla Wah said, &quot;No jobs [...] So if adults wanted to work, they had to leave quietly without getting caught by Thai police.&quot; Wah is a Karen refugee who lived in a camp where she went to school and helped her family because her parents sought to go out to work, but they earned little money. Wah suffered from malnutrition because her parents did not have money to buy food for her nine siblings.

There is an established governance system in the camps, which are funded by the United Nations, and other donors. The Karen Refugee Committee governs the day-to-day administration of the camp under the authority of the Thai government which guards entrances and exits to the camp. Within the camp there is a robust school system for children up to high school. In some camps there are college courses organized by the Karen Refugee Committee – Education Entity.

== Karen diaspora ==
=== American population ===

Beginning in 2000, the Karen started resettling in the United States and Canada. 

Many Karen arrive without speaking the local language. &quot;90% of the Karen refugees reported no knowledge of English or French on arrival.&quot; 

An estimated 20,000 Karen live in Minnesota, primarily Saint Paul. More than 5,000 Karen live in Nebraska, and the Karen have also resettled in Southern California and central New York. 

In 2014, Ler Htoo was sworn in after graduating from the St. Paul Police Academy in Minnesota as the first Karen police officer in the United States. Mu Aye is a young Karen woman who has resettled in San Diego, CA. Aye said, &quot;After growing up in a place like I did, I wanted to become a nurse. I wanted to help sick people [...] travel to refugee camps in Thailand and care for people who cannot afford medication.&quot; Additionally, Eh De Gray, who graduated from San Diego&#x27;s Crawford High School, wants to go back to the camps and share his knowledge with the school children. Gray said, &quot;I want to share my knowledge and experiences with them.&quot; 

=== Andaman Karen population ===
There is a population of 2,500 Karen in India, mostly restricted to Mayabunder Tehsil of the Northern Andaman Islands within the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Nearly all of them are Baptist Protestant Christians. They retain their language to intercommunicate within community, but use Hindi as a second language to communicate with non-Karen neighbours.

== Language ==
The Karen languages, members of the Tibeto-Burman group of the Sino-Tibetan language family, consist of three mutually unintelligible branches: Sgaw, Eastern Pwo, and Western Pwo.
The Karen languages are almost unique among the Tibeto-Burman languages in having a subject–verb–object word order; other than Karen and Bai, Tibeto-Burman languages typically feature a subject–object–verb order. This anomaly is likely due to the influence of neighbouring Mon and Tai languages.

== Religion ==
The majority of Karen are Theravada Buddhists who also practice animism, while approximately 15–30 percent are Christian. Lowland Pwo-speaking Karens tend to be more orthodox Buddhists, whereas highland Sgaw-speaking Karens tend to be heterodox Buddhists who profess strong animist beliefs.

=== Animism ===
Karen animism is defined by a belief in ကလၤ &quot;k&#x27;lar&quot; (soul), thirty-seven spirits that embody every individual. Misfortune and sickness are believed to be caused by &quot;k&#x27;lar&quot; that wander away, and death occurs when all thirty-seven &quot;klar&quot; leave the body.

=== Buddhism ===
Karen Buddhists are the most numerous of the Karens and account for around 65 percent of the total Karen population. The Buddhist influence came from the Mon who were dominant in Lower Burma until the middle of the 18th century. Buddhist Karen are found mainly in Kayin State, Mon State, Yangon, Bago and Tanintharyi Region. There are Buddhist monasteries in most Karen villages, and the monastery is the centre of community life. Merit-making activities, such as alms giving, are central to Karen Buddhist life.

Buddhism was brought to Pwo-speaking Karens in the late-1700s, and the Yedagon Monastery atop Mount Zwegabin became the leading center of Karen language Buddhist literature. Many millennial sects were founded throughout the 1800s, led by Karen Buddhist &quot;minlaung&quot; rebels. Two sects, Telakhon (or Telaku) and Leke, were founded in the 1860s. The Telaku sect, founded in Kyaing and considered a Buddhist sect, is a mixture of spirit worship, Karen customs and worship of the future Buddha Metteyya. The Leke sect was founded on the western banks of the Thanlwin River, and is no longer associated with Buddhism (as followers do not venerate Buddhist monks). 

Followers believe that the future Buddha will return to Earth if they maintain their moral practices (following the Dharma and precepts), and they practice vegetarianism, hold Saturday services and construct distinct pagodas. Several Buddhist socioreligious movements, both orthodox and heterodox, have arisen in the past century. &quot;Duwae&quot;, a type of pagoda worship, with animistic origins, is also practised.

There are several prominent Karen Buddhist monks, including Thuzana (S&#x27;gaw) and Zagara, who was conferred the &quot;Agga Maha Saddammajotika&quot; title by the Burmese government in 2004. The Karen of Thailand have their own religion, but some have converted to Buddhism through the efforts of missionaries.

=== Christianity ===
Tha Byu, the first convert to Christianity in 1828, was baptised by Rev. George Boardman, an associate of Adoniram Judson, founder of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Today there are Christians belonging to the Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. Some of the largest Protestant denominations are Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists.

A popular legend among the Karen people concerns a prophecy about a book which had been lost and would be returned by a &quot;white brother&quot;. This is held to have been fulfilled when the first American Baptist missionaries brought the Bible to the Karen people, but this legend is probably of nineteenth-century origin.

Alongside orthodox Christianity, some of those who identify themselves as Christian also have syncretised elements of animism with Christianity. The Karen of the Irrawaddy delta are mostly Christians, whereas Buddhists tend to be found mainly in Kayin state and surrounding regions. An estimated 15 to 20 percent of Karen identify themselves as Christian today and about 90 percent of Karen people in the US are Christians. Though other estimates put the Karen Christian population as high as 30 percent.

The Karen Baptist Convention (KBC) was established in 1913. Its headquarters is in Yangon with 20 member associations throughout Myanmar. The KBC operates the KBC Charity Hospital in Insein, Yangon. The KBC also operates the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary in Insein. The seminary runs a theology program as well as a secular degree program (Liberal Arts Programme) to fulfill young Karens&#x27; intellectual and vocational needs. The Pwo Karen Baptist Convention is in Ahlone, Yangon and also operates the Pwo Karen Theological Seminary. There are other schools for Karen people in Myanmar, such as Paku Divinity School in Taungoo, Kothabyu Bible School in Pathein, and Yangon Home Mission School. The Thailand Karen Baptist Convention is in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

The Seventh-day Adventists have built several schools in the Karen refugee camps in Thailand. Eden Valley Academy in Tak and Karen Adventist Academy in Mae Hong Son are the two largest Seventh-day Adventist Karen schools.

== Culture ==
Crop rotation agriculture has been a part of Karen culture for at least several hundred years.


The don dance is a traditional Karen performance. &quot;Don&quot; roughly translates to &quot;in agreement&quot;. The dance is a series of uniform movements accompanied by music played from traditional Karen instruments. During the performance, a &quot;Don Koh&quot; leads the troupe of dancers. The don dance originated from the Pwo Karen, who developed it as a way to reinforce community values.

The sae klee dance or bamboo dance is a traditional Karen performance held during celebrations such as Christmas and New Year&#x27;s. Performers are typically divided into two groups. One group creates a platform by holding bamboo sticks in a checkered pattern, while the other group dances on top of the platform. Dancers must be careful to avoid stepping into one of the platform&#x27;s many holes.

=== Cuisine ===
Talabaw or bamboo soup is a traditional Karen dish typically prepared with bamboo shoots, snakehead fish and basil leaves. A small amount of rice and some shreds of meat or seafood may also be added. The soup was traditionally used as a supplement to rice, which was not readily or cheaply available to them. Talabaw is one of the most well known soups in Myanmar, and widely considered to be the essential dish of Karen cuisine.

=== Holidays ===
The Karen New Year (ကညီနံၣ်ထီၣ်သီ) is one of the major holidays that the Karen people celebrate. The date of the Karen New Year on the Gregorian calendar varies as the Karen people use the lunar calendar. The Karen New Year usually falls on a date in December or January on the Gregorian calendar.

Karen National Day is commemorated on February 11.

Karen Wrist Tying (ကညီလါခူးကံၢ်စု) is an important Karen holiday. This holiday is observed annually in August.

Karen Martyrs&#x27; Day (&quot;Ma Tu Ra&quot;) commemorates the Karen soldiers who have died fighting for Karen self-determination. It is observed annually on 12 August, the anniversary of the death of Saw Ba U Gyi, the first President of the Karen National Union.

== Eponyms ==
A species of gecko, &quot;Hemidactylus karenorum&quot;, is named in honour of the Karen people.

<text>A speaking clock or talking clock is a live or recorded human voice service, usually accessed by telephone, that gives the correct time. The first telephone speaking clock service was introduced in France, in association with the Paris Observatory, on 14 February 1933.

The format of the service is similar to that of radio time signal services. At set intervals (&quot;e.g.&quot; ten seconds) a voice announces (for example) &quot;At the third stroke, the time will be twelve forty-six and ten seconds……&quot;, with three beeps following. Some countries have sponsored time announcements and include the sponsor&#x27;s name in the message.

==List by country==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, the number 1194 was the speaking clock in all areas. The service started in 1953 by the Post Master General&#x27;s Department, originally to access the talking clock on a rotary dial phone, callers would dial &quot;B074&quot;, during the transition from a rotary dial to a DTMF based phone system, the talking clock number changed from &quot;B074&quot; to 1194. It was always the current time from where the call originated, in part due to Telstra&#x27;s special call routing systems. Landline, Payphone and Mobile customers who called the 1194 time service would receive the time. A male voice, often known by Australians as &quot;George&quot;, would say &quot;At the third stroke, it will be (hours) (minutes) and (seconds) seconds/precisely. (three beeps)&quot; e.g. &quot;At the third stroke, it will be three thirty three and forty seconds&quot;. The time announcement was announced in 10 second increments and the beep was 1 kHz. Originally there was only one stroke e.g.:“At the stroke, it will be……” etc.
Prior to automatic systems, the subscriber rang an operator who would quote the time from a central clock in the exchange with a phrase such as &quot;The time by the exchange clock is ……&quot;. This was not precise and the operator could not always answer when the subscriber wanted. In 1954, British-made systems were installed in Melbourne (1st floor, City West Exchange) and Sydney. The mechanical speaking clock used rotating glass discs where different parts of the time were recorded on the disc. A synchronous motor drove the disc with the driving source derived from a 5 MHz quartz oscillator via a multi stage valve divider. This was amplified to give sufficient impetus to drive the motor. Because of the low torque available, a hand wheel was used to spin the motor on start up. The voice was provided by Gordon Gow. The units were designed for continuous operation. Both units in Melbourne and Sydney were run in tandem (primary and backup). For daylight saving time changes, one would be on line while the second was advanced or delayed by one hour and at the 02:00:00 Australian Eastern Standard time, would be switched over to the standby unit.

In addition to the speaking clocks, there was ancillary equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks to ensure that the system was &quot;on time&quot;. From a maintenance point of view, the most important part of the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the optical pickups from the glass disk recordings. When Time &amp; Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton Research Labs (3rd Flr. Building M5), the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of Caesium Beam Primary standards installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.
This mechanical system was replaced with a digital system in 1990. Each speaking clock ensemble consisted of two announcing units (Zag 500), a supervisory unit (CCU 500), two phase-locked oscillators, two pulse distribution units, a Civil Time Receiver (plus a spare), and two or four Computime 1200 baud modems. The voice was provided by Richard Peach, a former ABC broadcaster. The various components were sent for commercial production after a working prototype was built in the Telstra Research Laboratory (TRL). Assmann Australia used a German announcing unit and built a supervisory unit to TRL specifications. Design 2000 incorporated TRL oscillators in the phase locked oscillator units designed at TRL and controlled by two tone from the Telstra Caesium beam frequency standards. Ged Company built civil time receivers. The civil time code generators and two tone generators were designed and built within TRL. The changeover occurred at 12 noon, September 12, 1990.

Each state capital had a digital speaking clock for the local time of day with one access number for all Australia, 1194. In 2002 the Telstra 1194 service was migrated to Informatel (which uses its own digital technology, in conjunction with the National Measurement Institute — but kept the original voice of Richard Peach), whilst the other time services (e.g. hourly pips to radio stations) were retained as a service by Telstra. In May 2006 the remaining Telstra services were withdrawn and the digital hardware was decommissioned. Telstra ended the 1194 service on the midnight of October 1, 2019 and Australians no longer have access to this service. A web-based simulation of the 1194 service was created by musician Ryan Monro on the day of the original service&#x27;s shutdown.

=== Austria ===

In Austria, the speaking clock (&quot;Zeitansage&quot;, which literally means &quot;time announcement&quot;) number is 0810 00 1503 since 2009. A recorded female voice says: &quot;Es wird mit dem Summerton 15 Uhr, 53 Minuten und 10 Sekunden&quot;, meaning &quot;At the buzzing tone, the time will be 15 hours, 53 minutes and 10 seconds&quot;, followed by a short pause and a 1 kHz, 0.25 seconds long beep (even though the announcement &quot;buzzing tone&quot; suggests otherwise). The time is announced in 10 second intervals using the voice of radio host Angelika Lang.
Before 2009, the speaking clock was available at local call rates by dialing 1503. Until then, the voice was generated by an Assmann ZAG500 time announcement device. The announcements were voiced by former switchboard operator Renate Fuczik.

Telephone time signals first became available in Vienna in 1929, with an automatic voice announcement being added in 1941.

=== Belgium ===

In Belgium, the speaking clock used to be on the numbers 1200 (Dutch language), 1300 (French language), and 1400 (German language). Starting in September 2012, the service is only contactable on the numbers +32 78 05 12 00 (Dutch Language), +32 78 05 13 00 (French language) and +32 78 05 14 00 (German language). At the time of the number change, the service received 5,000 calls per day. The signal for the speaking clock came directly from the time service of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. First it came from a Zeiss clock, later from an atomic clock.

=== Canada ===
The NRC provides a Telephone Talking Clock service; voice announcements of Eastern Time are made every 10 seconds, followed by a tone indicating the exact time. This service is available to the general public by dialing +1 613 745-1576 for English service and +1 613 745-9426 for French service. Long-distance charges apply for those calling from outside the Ottawa/Gatineau area. The voices of the time announcements are Harry Mannis in English and Simon Durivage in French.

===China===

Dialling 117 in any city connects to a speaking clock that tells the current time in China. Currently 12117. Despite China spanning five time zones, only one time is kept over the country, therefore only one zone related service is required and the same time would be announced regardless of where the call was made. Rates are charged according to the ordinary local number, generally around 0.25 RMB/minute.

=== Finland ===

In Finland the speaking clock service is known as &quot;Neiti Aika&quot; in Finnish or &quot;Fröken Tid&quot; in Swedish, both of which mean &quot;Miss Time&quot;. The first Neiti Aika service was started in 1936 and was the first automated phone service in Finland. The service is provided by regional phone companies by dialling 10061 from any part of the country. The voice of the speaking clock is male or female depending on the phone company service. Nowadays the use of the Neiti Aika service has decreased significantly, and the press officer of Auria, the regional phone company of Turku, stated in an article of the &quot;Turun Sanomat&quot; newspaper that when the company started the service in 1938 it was used 352,310 times in its starting year, compared to 1,300 times in September 2006.

=== France ===
In France, the speaking clock (&quot;horloge parlante&quot;) was launched on 14 February 1933 and was the first service of its kind worldwide. It is available by dialing 3699 from within France, and was formerly available from overseas by dialing +33 8.36.99. - - . - - (where the - - could be any number). However, since September 2011, calls placed from outside France only work from some countries and networks. In May 2022, French telecom company Orange announced that the service will be discontinued on 1 July 2022, due to the &quot;steady and significant decrease&quot; of calls.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the speaking clock () was first offered by P&amp;T in 1970, and was accessed by dialling 1191. It announced the time in 24-hour format, in English only, at ten second intervals punctuated by a high pitched signal, as follows: “At the signal it will be HH:MM and …… seconds (signal). P&amp;T operator Frances Donegan was the original voice. Antoinette Rocks, also a P&amp;T/Telecom Éireann operator, provided the voice of the speaking clock when it was updated to digital technology in 1980. Her voice was selected as part of a competition on a radio phone-in show, RTÉ Radio 1‘s Morning Call with Mike Murphy. Listeners voted for one of 8 voices. At its peak, it received almost three million calls a year (about 8,000 a day). The Irish speaking clock service was permanently shut down by eir (P&amp;T’s successor) on 27 August 2018 due to lack of use and reliance on ageing equipment.

===Italy===
In Italy, the number of the speaking clock (&quot;il numero dell&#x27;ora esatta&quot;, &quot;the exact time number&quot;) was originally 16, the time was given by a recorded female voice. In the mid-seventies, 16 was replaced by 161. Presently, the number to be dialled is 4261.

=== Netherlands ===

On 1 October 1930, a system was installed in the Haarlem telephone exchange (automated in 1925) which indicated the time using a series of tones, accessed by the number 15290.

In 1934, electronic engineer and inventor F.H. Leeuwrik built a speaking clock for the municipal telephone service of The Hague using optically recorded speech, looping on a large drum. The female voice was provided by the then 24-year-old school teacher Cor Hoogendam, hence the machine was nicknamed &quot;Tante Cor&quot; (Aunt Cor).

In 1969, this system was replaced by a magnetic disk machine resembling a record player with three pick-up arms, telling the time at 10 second intervals followed by a beep. The text was spoken by actress Willie Brill. The service was now called over 130 million times a year.

In April 1992, the machinery was replaced by a digital device with no moving parts. The voice was provided by actress Joke Driessen and the clock&#x27;s accuracy is maintained by linking it to the German longwave radio transmitter DCF77. To comply with international guidelines limiting double-zero to use as an international prefix, the 002 number was changed on 3 December 1990 to 06–8002, and later to 0900–8002. The service still receives approximately four million calls a year.

=== New Zealand ===
The speaking clock in New Zealand is run by the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand. The service is accessed by dialling 0800 MSLTIME (0800 675846). MSL has been running the service since 1989.

=== Poland ===
The speaking clock in Poland is known as &quot;Zegarynka&quot; which means &quot;the clock girl&quot;. The service became first available in 1936, using a device invented and patented in Poland. It was speaking with the recorded voice of actress Lidia Wysocka. The first cities to be equipped with this device were Katowice, Warsaw (dialing number 05), Gdynia, Toruń and Kraków (July 1936).

=== Russia ===

In 1935, Soviet Central Scientific Research Institute of Communications received a government order to design the &quot;Speaking Clock&quot; for Moscow City Telephone Network. &quot;Speaking Clock&quot; was constructed based on cinematic techniques and consists of discs with pulse-density modulation optical marks on photographic tapes, photocell with actuator, and audio tube amplifier. On May 14, 1937 &quot;speaking clock&quot; connected to Moscow City Telephone Network for test operation and it was contactable on the numbers and . It was speaking with the recorded voice of Soviet actor and broadcaster Emmanuil Tobiash. In 1937, the first cities to be equipped with this devices were Moscow and Leningrad.

In 1969, the first Soviet &quot;Speaking Clock&quot; was replaced in Moscow City Telephone Network by a magnetic tape machine. Old ones were transferred to the Polytechnic Museum.

To hear the current time in Russia, either 100 or 060 can be dialed, depending on the city where this service is available. These calls are free if made from non-mobile phones. In Moscow, the Speaking Clock number is 100 if dialed from within the city, or +7-495-100-. . . . from other countries (where . . . . can be any number). At one time in Moscow, there were advertisements before and after the announcement of the current time; this practice has since ceased.

=== Spain ===
The speaking clock in Spain is run by the Spanish Navy from the Royal Observatory in San Fernando, and is accessed by dialling the number 956599429 free of charge.

=== Sweden ===
The speaking clock in Sweden is run by Telia and can be accessed by calling 90 510 from landline phones or 08-90 510 from mobile phones. The service is called &quot;Fröken Ur&quot; which means Miss Clock. It has been in use since 1934. Various voices have stated the time. Since 2000 the voice which states the time belongs to Johanna Hermann Lundberg. In 1977 the speaking clock in Sweden received 64 000 000 calls - which is the record for a year. In 2020 the number of calls was about 2 000 per day, meaning a total of a bit less than 1 000 000 calls annually.

=== South Africa ===
The speaking clock in South Africa is run by Telkom, the country&#x27;s national telecommunications provider, and can be contacted by dialling 1026 either from a fixed line or a cellular phone. The time is announced every 10 seconds and alternates between English and Afrikaans languages. An example of an English announcement of the time would be: &quot;When you hear the signal, it will be four hours, fifteen minutes and ten seconds&quot;, followed by a short audible tone to signal the exact time previously announced. The voice of the announcements is that of broadcaster and voiceover artist Helen Naudé. Recorded in 1989, the same speaking clock announcements with Naudé&#x27;s voice are still in use to the present day. Naudé also provided her voice talent to other Telkom services, such as 1023 directory enquiries, as well as the pre-recorded message &quot;The subscriber you have dialled does not exist&quot;, which can be heard when dialling an invalid phone number.

=== Ukraine ===
The speaking clock in Ukraine is run in Odesa and is available by dialling +380-48-737 6060.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== Usage ====
In the United Kingdom, the speaking clock can be heard by dialling 123 on a BT phone line; the number may vary on other networks. Every ten seconds, a voice announces:

The service was started in 1936 by the General Post Office (which handled telephones at that time) and was continued by BT after its formation in 1980 and privatisation in 1984. Between 1986 and 2008, the message included the phrase &quot;sponsored by Accurist&quot;; Accurist withdrew their sponsorship in 2008. The &quot;from BT&quot; part was added, then removed at some point, then reinstated.

For times that are an exact minute, &quot;precisely&quot; is substituted for the seconds portion of the announcement. Similarly, announcements for times between the hour and one minute past the hour substitute &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot; for the (zero) minutes. Other operators run their own speaking clocks, with broadly similar formats, or redirect to BT&#x27;s service. Virgin Media have their own service available by dialling 123 from a Virgin Media line. Sky also have their own service accessible by dialling 123 from a Sky telephone line. Dialling 123 from a few mobile services, such as O2, also obtains a speaking clock service. The Giffgaff network uses the same service as O2. The service is not available on the 3 mobile telephone network, as they use 123 as the number for their voicemail services. It was also unavailable on the Orange network for the same reason.

On the occasion of a leap second, such as at 23:59:60 on December 31, 2005, there is an extra second pause between the second and third beeps, to keep the speaking clock synchronised with Coordinated Universal Time: &quot;At the third stroke, the time from BT will be, twelve o&#x27;clock precisely. Beep, Beep, &lt;pause&gt; Beep.&quot; The current UK time source is the National Physical Laboratory, UK.

In 2011, the BBC reported: &quot;The service still receives 30 million calls each year.&quot;

==== History ====
A speaking clock service was first introduced in the United Kingdom on July 24, 1936. The mechanism used was an array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves which took up the floorspace of a small room. The voice was that of London telephonist Ethel Jane Cain, who had won a prize of 10 guineas () in a competition to find the &quot;Golden Voice&quot;. Cain&#x27;s voice was recorded optically onto the glass disks in a similar way to a film soundtrack. The service was obtained by dialling the letters TIM (846) on a dial telephone, and hence the service was often colloquially referred to as &quot;Tim&quot;. However this code was only used in the Director telephone system of the cities of London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. Other areas initially dialled 952, but with the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling it was changed to 80 and later 8081 as more &#x27;recorded services&#x27; were introduced. It was standardised to 123 by the early 1990s.

The time announcements were made by playing short, recorded phrases or words in the correct sequence. In an interview with Manchester Radio in 1957 Miss Cain said:

In 1963, the original device was replaced by more modern recording technology using a magnetic drum, similar to the Audichron technology used in the United States. The company that manufactured the rotating magnetic drum part of the Speaking Clock was Roberts &amp; Armstrong (Engineers) Ltd of North Wembley. They took on the licence from the British Post Office to manufacture complete clocks for the telecommunications authorities of Denmark, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland, and a third (spare) clock for the British Post Office. The latter was installed in Bow Street, London. The European clocks were modified for the 24-hour system by lengthening the drum and adding extra heads. Roberts &amp; Armstrong subcontracted the electronic aspects to the Synchronome Company of Westbury. The clocks were designed to run non-stop for 20 years. This system gave way to the present digital system in 1984, which uses a built-in crystal oscillator and microprocessor logic control. The complete apparatus comprises solid-state microchips, occupies no more shelf space than a small suitcase and has no moving parts at all. The BT service is assured to be accurate to five-thousandths of a second.

In 1986, BT allowed Accurist to sponsor its franchise, the first time a sponsor had been used for the service. In the latter years of this sponsorship, it cost 30 pence to call the speaking clock. Accurist announced its withdrawal from the deal and the launch of an online &quot;British Real Time&quot; website on 24 August 2008.

During the Cold War, the British Telecom speaking clock network was designed to be used in case of nuclear attack to broadcast messages from Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe to HANDEL units at regional police stations. From there, automatic warning sirens could be started and alerts sent to Royal Observer Corps monitoring posts and other civil defence volunteers equipped with manual warning devices. The rationale for using an existing rather than a dedicated system was that it was effectively under test at all times, rather than being activated (and possibly found to be faulty) only in the event of war. The signals to automatic sirens were sent down the wires of individual (unaware) subscribers for the same reason—a customer would report any fault as soon as it occurred, whereas a problem with a dedicated line would not be noticed until it was needed.

A version of the speaking clock was also used on recordings of proceedings at the Houses of Parliament made by the BBC Parliament Unit, partly as a time reference and partly to prevent editing. On a stereo recording, one track was used for the sound and the other for an endless recording of the speaking clock—without the pips, as these were found to cause interference.

==== &quot;BT&quot; &quot;Speaking Clock&quot; voices ====

=== United States ===

The first automated time service in the United States began in Atlanta, Georgia in 1934 as a promotion for Tick Tock Ginger Ale. Company owner John Franklin modified Western Electric technology to create the machine that would become known as the Audichron. The Audichron Company became the chief supplier of talking clocks in the US, maintained by local businesses and, later, the regional Bell System companies.

The service became typically known as the &quot;Time of Day&quot; service, with the term &quot;speaking clock&quot; never being used. Occasionally it would be called &quot;Time and Temperature&quot; or simply &quot;Time&quot;. However, the service has been phased out in most states (Nevada and Connecticut still maintain service). AT&amp;T discontinued its California service in September 2007, citing the widespread availability of sources such as mobile phones and computers. , calling (202) 762-1401 from anywhere in the US will give a correct time from EST or UTC time.

For all area codes in Northern California, and on the West Coast generally, the reserved exchange was 767 which was often indicated by its phoneword, POPCORN; the service was discontinued in 2007. In other locations, different telephone exchanges are or were used for the speaking clock service.

Many shortwave radio time signal services provide speaking clock services, such as WWV (voiced by John Doyle) and WWVH (voiced by Jane Barbe), operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology from the United States of America. To avoid disruption with devices that rely on the accurate timings and placement of the service tones from the radio, the voice recording is &quot;notched&quot; clear of some of the tones.

The website &quot;Telephone World&quot; has recordings of past and present &quot;Time of Day&quot; services that also include temperature and weather announcements.

<doc id="615212" wikidata="Q4024199" url="?curid=615212" title="Zephyr (band)">
<text>Zephyr was an American hard rock band formed in 1968 in Boulder, Colorado by guitarist Tommy Bolin, keyboardist John Faris, bass guitarist David Givens, drummer Robbie Chamberlin, and vocalist Candy Givens. The band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Zephyr&quot; (sometimes referred to as the bathtub album), on ABC/Probe reached #48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on March 14, 1970. Zephyr made an appearance on American Bandstand on 1/31/70 lip syncing to &quot;Cross the River&quot;. Although the charismatic performances by Candy Givens were the focal point for the band, the flashy guitar work of Bolin is what the band is best remembered for. 

When Bolin left after the band&#x27;s second release &quot;Going Back to Colorado&quot;, he was replaced by Jock Bartley, and the band recorded the album &quot;Sunset Ride&quot;, their second for Warner Brothers Records. On &quot;Sunset Ride&quot;, Candy Givens displayed her gifts as a singer, composer, and harmonica player. The album was produced by David Givens, who wrote most of the songs. As a result of his stint with Zephyr, Bartley went on to a successful career with Gram Parsons and Firefall. Drummer Michael Wooten went on to play for several years with Carole King and was a founding member of the jam band Leftover Salmon. Various versions of Zephyr continued to play in Colorado until Candy Givens died of a drug and alcohol overdose in Boulder on 27 January 1984 at the age of 37. The release of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; in 1982 was promoted with a music video that incorporated early examples of computer animation combined with live action.

Other Zephyr members include Otis Taylor, who played bass during the mid-1970s, Kenny Wilkins (drums), John Oliver drums, guitarist Zack Smith (founder of the band Scandal), and Eddie Turner, who played guitar in the last version of the band during the early 1980s. Candy and David Givens, Bolin, and Faris were founding members of the Legendary 4Nikators. Taylor and Turner were later additions to band. Taylor was noted for playing motorcycle on stage during &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; and performing in a kilt and Turner for his renditions of Jimi Hendrix songs.

In 2014, David Givens and record producer Greg Hampton released a limited edition boxed set that included a remastered version of the &quot;bathtub&quot; album, two albums of live material (most of it previously unreleased), and a booklet with liner notes by Givens and photos from his private collection. The band was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame in 2019.

<text>The California Spangled Cat is an experimental breed of cat with markings that resemble the cheetah or leopard created by Paul Casey.
==History==
Paul Casey was inspired to create the breed from a conversation he had with Louis Leakey. In relation to the death of a leopard by poachers Casey and Leakey discussed how people would be more likely to support conservation efforts if they had a cat that resembled a leopard.

Casey started with breeding a female Traditional Siamese to a Turkish Angora. Later breeds added to the bloodline were the British Shorthair, American Shorthair, Manx, and Abyssinian. Later on moggies from Malaya and Egypt were added to the gene pool. By 1985 the look of the breed had been established and managed to form a breed club, the California Spangled Cat Association.

Casey advertised his breed in the Neiman-Marcus catalog which generated controversy from both fanciers and animal rights activists, the latter due to Neiman-Marcus catalog advertising animal coats. The widespread publicity worked in Casey&#x27;s favour and hundreds of people inquired about the breed.

Despite the publicity the breeds numbers progressed slowly due to most cats being sold. In 1994 a California Sprangled won best in show at a Paris fancier competition.

In 2003 only around 200 California Sprangled Cats were recorded to exist.
==Recognition==
The California Sprangled has experimental recognition with both the American Cat Association (ACA) and The International Cat Association (TICA).
==Appearance==
The California Sprangled&#x27;s markings are similar to that of a leopard or cheetah with well defined spots and musculature. The spots may be round, square, triangular, and oval. Eyelet, fish scale, and crescent spots are disallowed.

<doc id="615222" wikidata="Q2035437" url="?curid=615222" title="Multivariable calculus">
<text>Multivariable calculus (also known as multivariate calculus) is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables: the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables (&quot;multivariate&quot;), rather than just one. 

Multivariable calculus may be thought of as an elementary part of calculus on Euclidean space. The special case of calculus in three dimensional space is often called &quot;vector calculus&quot;.

==Introduction==
In single-variable calculus, operations like differentiation and integration are made to functions of a single variable. In multivariate calculus, it is required to generalize these to multiple variables, and the domain is therefore multi-dimensional. Care is therefore required in these generalizations, because of two key differences between 1D and higher dimensional spaces:
# There are infinite ways to approach a single point in higher dimensions, as opposed to two (from the positive and negative direction) in 1D;
# There are multiple extended objects associated with the dimension; for example, for a 1D function, it must be represented as a curve on the 2D Cartesian plane, but a function with two variables is a surface in 3D, while curves can also live in 3D space.

The consequence of the first difference is the difference in the definition of the limit and differentiation. Directional limits and derivatives define the limit and differential along a 1D parametrized curve, reducing the problem to the 1D case. Further higher-dimensional objects can be constructed from these operators.

The consequence of the second difference is the existence of multiple types of integration, including line integrals, surface integrals and volume integrals. Due to the non-uniqueness of these integrals, an antiderivative or indefinite integral cannot be properly defined.

== Limits ==
A study of limits and continuity in multivariable calculus yields many counterintuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions.

A limit along a path may be defined by considering a parametrised path formula_1 in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Any function formula_2 can then be projected on the path as a 1D function formula_3. The limit of formula_4 to the point formula_5 along the path formula_6 can hence be defined as

Note that the value of this limit can be dependent on the form of formula_6, i.e. the path chosen, not just the point which the limit approaches. For example, consider the function

:formula_8

If the point formula_9 is approached through the line formula_10, or in parametric form:

Then the limit along the path will be:

On the other hand, if the path formula_11 (or parametrically, formula_12) is chosen, then the limit becomes:

Since taking different paths towards the same point yields different values, a general limit at the point formula_9 cannot be defined for the function.

A general limit can be defined if the limits to a point along all possible paths converge to the same value, i.e. we say for a function formula_14 that the limit of formula_4 to some point formula_16 is L, if and only if

for all continuous functions formula_1 such that formula_18.

=== Continuity ===
From the concept of limit along a path, we can then derive the definition for multivariate continuity in the same manner, that is: we say for a function formula_14 that formula_4 is continuous at the point formula_21, if and only if

for all continuous functions formula_1 such that formula_18.

As with limits, being continuous along &quot;one&quot; path formula_6 does not imply multivariate continuity.

Continuity in each argument not being sufficient for multivariate continuity can also be seen from the following example. For example, for a real-valued function formula_25 with two real-valued parameters, formula_26, continuity of formula_4 in formula_28 for fixed formula_29 and continuity of formula_4 in formula_29 for fixed formula_28 does not imply continuity of formula_4.

Consider
:formula_34

It is easy to verify that this function is zero by definition on the boundary and outside of the quadrangle formula_35. Furthermore, the functions defined for constant formula_28 and formula_29 and formula_38 by
:formula_39 and formula_40
are continuous. Specifically,
:formula_41 for all and . Therefore, formula_42 and moreover, along the coordinate axes, formula_43 and formula_44. Therefore the function is continuous along both individual arguments.

However, consider the parametric path formula_45. The parametric function becomes

Therefore,

It is hence clear that the function is not multivariate continuous, despite being continuous in both coordinates.

===Theorems regarding multivariate limits and continuity ===
* All properties of linearity and superposition from single-variable calculus carry over to multivariate calculus.
* Composition: If formula_14 and formula_47 are both multivariate continuous functions at the points formula_16 and formula_49 respectively, then formula_50 is also a multivariate continuous function at the point formula_21.
* Multiplication: If formula_52 and formula_53 are both continuous functions at the point formula_16, then formula_55 is continuous at formula_21, and formula_57 is also continuous at formula_21 provided that formula_59.
* If formula_52 is a continuous function at point formula_16, then formula_62 is also continuous at the same point.
* If formula_14 is Lipschitz continuous (with the appropriate normed spaces as needed) in the neighbourhood of the point formula_16, then formula_4 is multivariate continuous at formula_21.
From the Lipschitz continuity condition for formula_4 we have

where formula_68 is the Lipschitz constant. Note also that, as formula_6 is continuous at formula_70, for every formula_71 there exists a formula_72 such that formula_73 formula_74.

Hence, for every formula_75, choose formula_76; there exists an formula_72 such that for all formula_78 satisfying formula_79, formula_73, and formula_81. Hence formula_82 converges to formula_83 regardless of the precise form of formula_6.

== Differentiation ==
=== Directional derivative ===
The derivative of a single-variable function is defined as

Using the extension of limits discussed above, one can then extend the definition of the derivative to a scalar-valued function formula_52 along some path formula_1:

Unlike limits, for which the value depends on the exact form of the path formula_6, it can be shown that the derivative along the path depends only on the tangent vector of the path at formula_5, i.e. formula_89, provided that formula_4 is Lipschitz continuous at formula_5, and that the limit exits for at least one such path.

For formula_6 continuous up to the first derivative (this statement is well defined as formula_93 is a function of one variable), we can write the Taylor expansion of formula_93 around formula_70 using Taylor&#x27;s theorem to construct the remainder:

where formula_96.

Substituting this into ,

where formula_97.

Lipschitz continuity gives us formula_98 for some finite formula_68, formula_100. It follows that formula_101.

Note also that given the continuity of formula_102, formula_103 as formula_104.

Substituting these two conditions into ,

whose limit depends only on formula_89 as the dominant term.

It is therefore possible to generate the definition of the directional derivative as follows: The directional derivative of a scalar-valued function formula_106 along the unit vector formula_107 at some point formula_16 is

} f(x_0) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+\hat{\bold{u}} t) - f(x_0)}{t}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
or, when expressed in terms of ordinary differentiation,

} f(x_0) = \left . \frac{df(x_0+\hat{\bold{u}}t)}{dt} \right |_{t=0}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

which is a well defined expression because formula_109 is a scalar function with one variable in formula_78.

It is not possible to define a unique scalar derivative without a direction; it is clear for example that formula_111. It is also possible for directional derivatives to exist for some directions but not for others.

=== Partial derivative ===

The partial derivative generalizes the notion of the derivative to higher dimensions. A partial derivative of a multivariable function is a derivative with respect to one variable with all other variables held constant.

A partial derivative may be thought of as the directional derivative of the function along a coordinate axis.

Partial derivatives may be combined in interesting ways to create more complicated expressions of the derivative. In vector calculus, the del operator (formula_112) is used to define the concepts of gradient, divergence, and curl in terms of partial derivatives. A matrix of partial derivatives, the Jacobian matrix, may be used to represent the derivative of a function between two spaces of arbitrary dimension. The derivative can thus be understood as a linear transformation which directly varies from point to point in the domain of the function.

Differential equations containing partial derivatives are called partial differential equations or PDEs. These equations are generally more difficult to solve than ordinary differential equations, which contain derivatives with respect to only one variable.

== Multiple integration ==

The multiple integral extends the concept of the integral to functions of any number of variables. Double and triple integrals may be used to calculate areas and volumes of regions in the plane and in space. Fubini&#x27;s theorem guarantees that a multiple integral may be evaluated as a &quot;repeated integral&quot; or &quot;iterated integral&quot; as long as the integrand is continuous throughout the domain of integration.

The surface integral and the line integral are used to integrate over curved manifolds such as surfaces and curves.

===Fundamental theorem of calculus in multiple dimensions===
In single-variable calculus, the fundamental theorem of calculus establishes a link between the derivative and the integral. The link between the derivative and the integral in multivariable calculus is embodied by the integral theorems of vector calculus:
* Gradient theorem
* Stokes&#x27; theorem
* Divergence theorem
* Green&#x27;s theorem.

In a more advanced study of multivariable calculus, it is seen that these four theorems are specific incarnations of a more general theorem, the generalized Stokes&#x27; theorem, which applies to the integration of differential forms over manifolds.

==Applications and uses==
Techniques of multivariable calculus are used to study many objects of interest in the material world. In particular,

Multivariable calculus can be applied to analyze deterministic systems that have multiple degrees of freedom. Functions with independent variables corresponding to each of the degrees of freedom are often used to model these systems, and multivariable calculus provides tools for characterizing the system dynamics.

Multivariate calculus is used in the optimal control of continuous time dynamic systems. It is used in regression analysis to derive formulas for estimating relationships among various sets of empirical data.

Multivariable calculus is used in many fields of natural and social science and engineering to model and study high-dimensional systems that exhibit deterministic behavior. In economics, for example, consumer choice over a variety of goods, and producer choice over various inputs to use and outputs to produce, are modeled with multivariate calculus. 

Non-deterministic, or stochastic systems can be studied using a different kind of mathematics, such as stochastic calculus.

<text>Baby Animals is an Australian hard rock band active from October 1989 to 1996 and reformed in 2007. The original line-up was Frank Celenza on drums; Suze DeMarchi on lead vocals and guitar; Dave Leslie on guitar and backing vocals; and Eddie Parise on bass guitar and backing vocals. They recorded two studio albums, &quot;Baby Animals&quot; (September 1991) – which peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and &quot;Shaved and Dangerous&quot; (August 1993) – which reached No. 2. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 the group won three trophies: Album of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Baby Animals&quot; and Breakthrough - Single for &quot;Early Warning&quot;. &quot;Baby Animals&quot; was listed in &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010). The reunited line-up are DeMarchi, Leslie, Dario Bortolin on bass guitar and Mick Skelton on drums and percussion. Their fourth studio album, &quot;This Is Not the End&quot;, was issued in May 2013, which reached the top 20.

==Biography==
=== Early history: 1989–1990 ===
The Baby Animals were formed in Sydney in October 1989 by Frank Celenza on drums (ex-Boys, Bamboo Curtain, DD and the Rockmen); Suze DeMarchi on lead vocals and guitar (ex-Photoplay, the Kind, DD and the Rockmen), Dave Leslie on guitar and backing vocals (ex-Swingshift); and Eddie Parise on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-Boys, Bel Aires, Bamboo Curtain). De Marchi, from Perth, had previously recorded three solo singles with EMI in the United Kingdom.

Upon her return to Perth in July DeMarchi contacted former bandmate Celenza to form a new band in Sydney. He was initially reluctant to go but recommended another former bandmate, Parise. In Sydney, DeMarchi approached her then-manager, John Woodruff (The Angels, Diesel [ex-the Kind, with DeMarchi]), who signed the new group and referred Leslie to her. Celenza then officially joined. Woodruff later recalled &quot;I&#x27;d seen [DeMarchi] in London performing some bad Stock Aitken and Waterman tunes on television late one night. I found her and she turned out to be Australian. She also turned out to have a lot of attitude. I brought her back to Australia and put a band together around her.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first performance was in November 1989 at the Kardomah Café in Sydney, where they were billed as Woody&#x27;s Heroes, then they worked the city&#x27;s pub and club circuit. According to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s writer, Celenza provided the new name, Baby Animals, after seeing an ad for a local TV show, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, hosted by &quot;Baby&quot; John Burgess. Another version suggests the name came from a calendar in a mall. In a New Zealand magazine, &quot;RTR Sounz&quot;, DeMarchi indicated that they changed the story of the name&#x27;s origins in different interviews as they were bored with that question.

Baby Animals were assisted by the Angels including one of their demos, &quot;Break My Heart&quot;, on the B-side of the established band&#x27;s single, &quot;Dogs Are Talking&quot; (April 1990). &quot;Break My Heart&quot; was co-written by DeMarchi and Parise. The single also included a track each, from two other new rock and roll bands – the Desert Cats and the Hurricanes – a national tour by the Angels followed with all three new bands supporting.

In August 1990 Baby Animals signed a publishing deal with SBK Songs (later EMI Music Publishing). After attending a gig, Terry Ellis, president of newly formed Imago Recording Company, signed them to his label, funded by BMG. Ellis described the performance, &quot;the band was great, the songs were terrific and to me Suze clearly had that indefineable magic that separates one artist from the crowd and makes them a star.&quot;

=== Debut album: 1991–1992 ===
The band flew to New York to record their debut eponymous album, &quot;Baby Animals&quot;, at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and Second City Studio, Long Island with ex-pat Australian Mike Chapman producing. DeMarchi said of the production process: &quot;He very rigidly made us pull things back and just concentrate on the essence of the song rather than being fancy. Mike was the taskmaster – &#x27;Let me hear the hooks&#x27;. Like Early Warning - that tag at the beginning &#x27;too young to know too old to listen&#x27; - Mike said &#x27;I&#x27;m going to take that part of the chorus, let&#x27;s put that at the front; that&#x27;s the hook&#x27;.&quot;

Woodruff had organised for his band to work with Chapman and Kevin &quot;Caveman&quot; Shirley (audio engineer): &quot;I had never met [Chapman], I knew his work. I&#x27;d listened to everything he&#x27;d ever done... I thought &#x27;if we can drag him out of retirement to get the song structure right&#x27;... Susie was writing great songs and great sentiments, but the structure wasn&#x27;t quite there. I thought if I can then convince him to work with a young rude engineer, which turned out to be [Shirley], and you couldn&#x27;t get much younger or ruder than that, then I&#x27;m going to end up with a record that has an edge to it, that has some tone to it, that has some rock and roll and that has some feel to it that&#x27;s as edgy as she is but with great songs.&quot;

Their debut single, Early Warning (April 1991), reached the Top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The track was written by DeMarchi, Parise and Leslie. After the release of the single, the band flew to the United States for a series of showcases for the Imago/BMG people, to coincide with the earlier release of the album there. Their second single, &quot;Rush You&quot;, was issued in August, which also reached the Top 30.

&quot;Baby Animals&quot; was released in September 1991, which debuted at No 6 on the ARIA Albums Charts. In the following February–March it spent six weeks at No 1. It spent a total of 46 weeks in the top 50 and was certified four times platinum by ARIA for shipment of over 280,000 units. It remained the highest-selling debut Australian rock album until the release of Jet&#x27;s effort, &quot;Get Born&quot; (September 2003) – twelve years later. &quot;Baby Animals&quot; also appeared in the top 30 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart and top 50 on the Swedish Albums Chart. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt it &quot;showcased the band&#x27;s confident and melodic brand of hard rock and, in particular, highlighted DeMarchi&#x27;s provocative vocal growl.&quot;

After listening to the album, Bryan Adams asked them to join his European tour. Whilst overseas, in November 1991, they won the Best New Act category at the inaugural Australian Music Awards. By Christmas that year the band were back in Australia for more national touring, and the release of two more singles, &quot;Painless&quot; (November) and &quot;One Word&quot; (February 1992); the latter peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Singles Chart – their highest position. Baby Animals&#x27; Let Go of My Ears Tour had them playing to sell out crowds.

In 1992 the band joined Black Crowes on tours of Australia and New Zealand. In the US they appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and performed &quot;Painless&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 they won trophies for Album of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Baby Animals&quot; and Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Early Warning&quot;. The band then toured as a support act for Van Halen&#x27;s For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour across the US from 28 January to 31 May, playing to arena-size audiences. Eddie Van Halen requested their presence after his wife Valerie had heard their album, and suggested them. Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed DeMarchi on the cover. It was the first time they had put an Australian artist or group on the cover on the merits of a debut album. The band had played over 500 shows when they ended that tour in August 1992.

In November 1992, Baby Animals released a new single, titled &quot;Impossible to Fly&quot;. It peaked at No. 48 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

=== &quot;Shaved and Dangerous&quot; and disbandment: 1993–1996 ===
In 1993 Baby Animals returned to Bearsville Studios, to start work on their second album, &quot;Shaved and Dangerous&quot; (August 1993), with two weeks of pre-production. They went to the Bahamas and spent two months recording at Compass Point Studios with Ed Stasium producing (Ramones, Living Colour, Hoodoo Gurus). Next, they travelled to Los Angeles, where they worked with Nuno Bettencourt (of Extreme); he provided song writing and guitar on &quot;Because I Can&quot; and produced &quot;Life From a Distance&quot; and &quot;Be My Friend&quot;.

McFarlane described the album as &quot;a more adventurous progressive rock album. It had less of a commercial feel, and Leslie layered the songs with snaking guitar solos.&quot; Daniel Gioffre of AllMusic felt that &quot;For the most part, the songwriting here is topnotch, with most of the songs showcasing fairly sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic ideas. Despite the proggy nature of some of the compositions, the mix is total pop, with DeMarchi way up front. However, this is a good thing, as she has a very strong, if sometimes overemotive, singing voice.&quot; The album peaked at No. 2 in Australia. Bettencourt also contributed to &quot;She Does Whatever&quot; on the &quot;Shaved and Dangerous&quot; Tour CD. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 the group received two nominations for &quot;One Word&quot;: Single of the Year and Best Group.

During mid-1993 Baby Animals supported Robert Plant&#x27;s US tour, before returning to Australia late in the year to prepare for a 27-date Australian tour. The tour was cut short when DeMarchi experienced throat problems, vocal fold nodules, which required her to undertake surgery on her vocal cords. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 they received another nomination for Best Group – this time for &quot;Shaved and Dangerous&quot;.

In August 1994 Baby Animals shared the stage with Extreme in a concert on the Azores island of São Miguel. In that month DeMarchi and Bettencourt married and the couple moved to Boston. Song writing and recording for a proposed third album was anticipated for November. In 1995 on the verge of their first major US tour, US-based Imago Records folded after losing support from BMG. In early 1996 Baby Animals officially disbanded as the band members undertook separate projects.

=== Reformed and new albums: 2007–2017 ===
Baby Animals reformed in 2007 in the US with all four original members: Celenza, DeMarchi, Leslie and Parise. They released an acoustic CD of their previous hits, &quot;Il Grande Silenzio&quot;, on 19 January 2008, as part of the Liberation Blue Acoustic Series. The band appeared live on Australian breakfast TV program, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, three days later, and confirmed local tour dates for that year. In the following January they announced another national tour throughout that year, which was subsequently sold out.

Early in 2009 internal conflicts become apparent, Celenza and Parise eventually left. In April that year Demarchi and Leslie continued the group with Matt Cornell on bass guitar and vocals, and Mick Skelton in drums. Cornell was later replaced by Dario Bortolin.

In April 2013 the Baby Animals line-up of Bortolin, Demarchi, Leslie and Skelton released their first new single in 20 years, &quot;Email&quot;. It was followed by the release of a new album, &quot;This Is Not the End&quot;, in late May. This was the first album released by new label Social Family Records, which peaked at No. 19.

In May 2016 the Baby Animals re-released &quot;Baby Animals&quot; as &quot;Baby Animals 25th Anniversary&quot; (or &quot;BA25&quot;), to celebrate 25 years since the original release of their debut. This expanded version includes live songs, unreleased tracks, B-sides and pre-studio demos. Also in that month they provided two gigs with the original line-up performing the debut album in full and the new line-up playing tracks from &quot;This Is Not the End&quot;. Baby Animals performed a national headline tour with The Screaming Jets in June and July 2017. A live album was released in November 2017.

=== &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;: 2018–present ===
In February 2018, Baby Animals released &quot;Tonight&quot; which lead singer Suze DeMarchi wrote after her father died suddenly. In January 2019, the band announced their first greatest hits would be released in February 2019. The album will include three new recordings including a cover of Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;How Do I Make You&quot;. From November 2019, The Baby Animals co-headlined the &quot;They Who Rock 2019&quot; tour with The Angels. To promote the tour, The Angels released a cover of The Baby Animals&#x27; &quot;One Word&quot; and the Baby Animals covered The Angels&#x27; &quot;Marseilles&quot;, both released on 1 October 2019.
In 2020 the Baby Animals were part of the Red Hot Summer Tour series of outdoor shows around Australia, alongside Boom Crash Opera, Killing Heidi, The Angels, The Living End, James Reyne and headliner, Hunters and Collectors.

<doc id="615224" wikidata="Q1671179" url="?curid=615224" title="Leather Goddesses of Phobos">
<text>Leather Goddesses of Phobos is an interactive fiction video game written by Steve Meretzky and published by Infocom in 1986. It was released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, Apple II, Mac, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, and MS-DOS. The game was Infocom&#x27;s first &quot;sex farce&quot;, including selectable gender and &quot;naughtiness&quot;—the latter ranging from &quot;tame&quot; to &quot;lewd&quot;. It was one of five top-selling Infocom titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions. It was Infocom&#x27;s twenty-first game.

==Gameplay==
To start the game a gender must be chosen and the player will get a sidekick character. If the player&#x27;s character is male, he will meet a burly but dim-witted man named Trent; if the player&#x27;s character is female, she will find an attractive but somewhat ditzy woman named Tiffany. There are differences in game-play between the two sexes.

&quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; bore a difficulty rating of &quot;Standard&quot;. The game has 75 locations, including the maze known as the catacombs, the planets Mars and Venus (which must be explored extensively), outer space, and the city of Cleveland, which is a single location with one building and two exits.

==Plot==
The game begins in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, in 1936 and is presented in the manner of a science fiction serial of that time. In the story, the Leather Goddesses of Phobos are just finalizing their plans for the invasion of Earth. The player&#x27;s character had been abducted by the Leather Goddesses for the final testing of the plan which would enslave all of humanity. Unless this nefarious plan is stopped, the Earth is turned into a twisted sexual pleasure dome.

==Development==
A few months after Infocom moved into its Cambridge offices, Meretzky jokingly wrote the words &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; on a large chalkboard that listed all of the Infocom games that were in release at that point. Meretzky described the title as &quot;something that would be a little embarrassing, but not awful.&quot; Joel Berez spotted the added line before anyone else arrived and erased it quickly, but the name stuck and was jokingly brought up whenever a non-existent game title needed to be worked into a sentence. Eventually, in 1985, Meretzky came around to the idea of actually creating a game under this title, and started its development as a 1930s science fiction pulp story – the idea was instantly accepted by Marc Blank and the other Infocom staff. Upper management was more difficult to convince, and then-CEO Al Vezza (who was more interested in the business side of the company) was not enthused with the idea. However, when Infocom was acquired by Activision in 1986 due to the bankrupted business products effort, Activision president Jim Levy was much more excited: when told that &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was not its definitive title, he allegedly responded with &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t call it anything else!&quot;

Infocom marketing director Mike Dornbrook referred to &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; as &quot;&quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; with sex.&quot; In The Status Line (formerly The New Zork Times), Infocom&#x27;s official newsletter, Steve Meretzky stated that the title &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was conceived more than four years before the game was released. He also cites &quot;pulpy space opera&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Leather Goddesses&quot;, and expresses that a lack of controversial response to &quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot; was another reason for &quot;Leather Goddess&quot;&#x27; conception, stating that &quot;I was hoping that [&quot;A Mind Forever Voyaging&quot;] would stir up a lot of controversy. It didnt ... So I decided to write something with a little bit of sex in it, because &quot;nothing&quot; generates controversy like sex. I&#x27;m hoping to get the game banned from Seven-Eleven stores.&quot; Meretzky states that the &quot;naughtiness&quot; levels were based on the film rating system, with tame, suggestive, and lewd corresponding to G, PG, and R respectively.

==Release==
The game was not copy protected, but included puzzles that relied on the accompanying documentation and physical items in the package:

#A small scratch and sniff card which bore seven numbered areas (at certain points in the game, the player would be instructed to scratch a certain number and then whiff the resulting odor such as pizza and chocolate).
#&quot;The Adventures of Lane Mastodon&quot;, a 3-D comic book containing vital hints to the game.
#3D glasses for the comic book.
#A double-sided map of the catacombs.

This take on copy protection earned &quot;Leather Goddesses&quot; a Codie award for &quot;Best Software Packaging&quot; in 1987.

==Reception==
&quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was Infocom&#x27;s best-selling game in 1986 with 53,543 copies sold, more than 50% greater than that of &quot;Trinity&quot;, which also debuted that year. The company sold a total of about 130,000 copies, three times as many as any other game after Activision bought them. The game was Infocom&#x27;s last to sell more than 100,000 copies, and its sixth best-selling game overall.

&quot;Macworld&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;, calling it &quot;an excellent [example] of text-only interactive fiction.&quot; &quot;Macworld&quot; expresses that &quot;Leather Goddesses&quot; has &quot;respect for female players ... &quot;Leather Goddesses&quot; is neither sexist nor truly offensive. Its humor punctures the pretensions of the fantasy adventure genre.&quot; &quot;Macworld&quot; praises the gameplay, stating that it has &quot;inventive plots and puzzles&quot; and &quot;consistency of mood and attitude&quot;. &quot;Macworld&quot; criticizes the inability to scroll back to previously seen text.

&quot;.Info&quot; in 1987 gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing it as &quot;fun to play, though Infocom has produced more challenging standard-level text adventures ... a lot of giggles in this one&quot;. The magazine assured readers they would not be offended by the game, as even its lewdest &quot;naughtiness&quot; level is relatively tame. In 1988, Tom Clancy named &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; one of his favorite computer games, stating &quot;I&#x27;d like to meet whoever wrote that. I just don&#x27;t know what asylum to go to&quot;.

==Legacy==
A sequel to &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot;, subtitled &quot;Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X!&quot;, was published by Activision in 1992.

In the 2015 film &quot;The Martian&quot; starring Matt Damon, &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; was referenced as being loaded on fellow astronaut Beth Johanssen&#x27;s laptop alongside &quot;Zork II&quot;.

Sierra Online parodied the game as &quot;Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros&quot; in their graphical adventure &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;.

<doc id="615227" wikidata="Q3215145" url="?curid=615227" title="Potholes Reservoir">
<text>The Potholes Reservoir is part of the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project. It is formed by the O&#x27;Sullivan Dam and located in central Washington, in the United States. The reservoir is fed by water from Moses Lake, part of the Crab Creek basin.

The area features several lakes (typically 30-70 yards wide and 10–30 feet deep). These lakes, known as &quot;potholes&quot; were created through both natural and man made processes. The potholes were initially carved out during the Pleistocene by flood waters originating from Glacial Lake Missoula. Subsequent damming of the area by the Columbia Basin Project raised the water table high enough to allow these topographical depressions to become lakes. The formation of the pothole lakes also allowed the creation of thousands of micro-islands as the lakes wrap around the dunes, forming islands. They are home to willow trees and cattails due to their boggy-like state.

==Recreation==

On the shore of the reservoir is Potholes State Park, a member of the Washington State Park System. It has of shoreline on the reservoir.

==Fishing==
There are many types of fish inside of the reservoir, including:
*Largemouth bass
*Smallmouth bass
*Rainbow trout
*Walleye
*Black crappie
*Yellow perch
*Bluegill
*Lake whitefish
*Carp
*Steelhead

The area has a community hall and a Country Fire Authority fire station.

==History==

Doreen was initially established by Europeans in the year 1844. One of these early settlers was Patrick Reid. Reid had a holding over the land, calling the area &quot;Hazel Glen&quot;. In 1862, Reid&#x27;s holdings over the land were subdivided into farmland, which led to further settlers coming to the area. The increase in settlers led to the construction of a Methodist church on the corner of Yan Yean Road and Chapel Lane, which was opened in 1862.

The Doreen name comes from John Gavan Duffy, the Victorian Postmaster-General and a member of the Legislative Assembly.

Hazel Glen Common School (currently Doreen Primary) was later built by the local community and was completed in 1867. The school later received aid from the government on 1 July 1868, and was then recognised as Hazel Glen Common School No.945.

==Suburban development==

Doreen is unusual in that it can be divided into two smaller areas, with Yan Yean Road being the divider;
* The eastern portion lies within the Shire of Nillumbik and remains rural, being contiguous with the rural localities of Yarrambat and Nutfield. 
* The western portion lies within the City of Whittlesea and has seen the development of suburban housing and facilities. It is contiguous with the suburbs of Mernda and South Morang.

Residential development is of two kinds: 
* Rural residential estates and nurseries to the south.
* A residential estate, Laurimar, in the north is being developed by Delfin, a subsidiary of Lend Lease Corporation, with an emphasis on &quot;semi-rural&quot; living.

Doreen is very green and quite hilly and is surrounded by the foothills of the Yarra Ranges to the east and north and the forested banks of the Plenty River to the west. As part of it being on the urban fringe, it has a wide variety of animal life including bird life. To the north is Yan Yean Reservoir, which is the oldest reservoir in Melbourne.

==Facilities==

A mobile library that visits Doreen is operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Four bus routes service Doreen:
* : Mernda station – Diamond Creek station. Operated by Dysons.

<text>The Catholic Church in New Zealand () is part of the worldwide Catholic Church under the leadership of the Pope in Rome, assisted by the Roman Curia, and with the New Zealand bishops.

Catholicism was introduced to New Zealand in 1838 by missionaries from France, who converted Māori. As settlers from the British Isles arrived in New Zealand, many of them Irish Catholics, the Catholic Church became a settler church rather than a mission to Māori. 

According to the 2023 census, &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; was the second-largest single Christian religious affiliation in New Zealand, with 289,788 adherents, while the largest was &quot;Christian (not further defined),&quot; which recorded 364,644.

In New Zealand there is one archdiocese (Wellington) and five suffragan dioceses (Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton and Palmerston North). The church is overseen by the New Zealand Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference. Its primate is the Metropolitan Archbishop of Wellington, who has been Paul Martin since 2023.

==History==
===Beginnings===

The first Christian service conducted in New Zealand waters may have occurred if Father Paul-Antoine Léonard de Villefeix, the Dominican chaplain of the French navigator, Jean-François de Surville, celebrated Mass in Doubtless Bay, near Whatuwhiwhi, on Christmas Day, 1769.
Nearly 70 years later, in January 1838, another Frenchman, Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier (1807–1871) arrived in New Zealand as the Vicar Apostolic of Western Oceania. He made New Zealand the centre of his activities, which covered a vast area in the Pacific. He celebrated his first Mass in New Zealand at Totara Point, Hokianga, at the home of an Irish family, Thomas and Mary Poynton and their children, on 13 January 1838. Pompallier was accompanied by members of the Society of Mary (Marists), and more soon arrived. The mission headquarters were established in Kororāreka (later called Russell) where the Marists constructed a building (now called Pompallier) from pisé and set up a printing press. As well as stationing missionaries in the north, Pompallier began work in the Bay of Plenty, in the Waikato amongst Māori, and in Auckland and Wellington areas amongst European settlers.
In 1840, New Zealand became a British colony with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The number of Catholic colonists comprised fewer than 500, from a total number of around 5000.

The Catholic Church established New Zealand as a separate vicariate in 1842.

===The mission splits===
As a result of disagreement between Pompallier and Jean-Claude Colin, Superior of the Marists in France, Rome agreed to divide New Zealand into two ecclesiastical administrations from 1850. Pompallier became Bishop of Auckland and the Marist Bishop Philippe Viard (1809–1872) took charge of Wellington, which included the southern half of the North Island and the whole of the South Island. This decision meant that much of the Māori mission in the North (where most Māori lived) was abandoned; the Marists working in what became the Auckland diocese, including those who spoke Māori, moved to Wellington. However, Pompallier, who was in Europe in 1850, returned to New Zealand with more priests, the first Sisters of Mercy and ten seminarians, whose training was quickly completed. All but one of them were ordained within five weeks, and their training was the origin of St Mary&#x27;s Seminary founded in that year.

Increasingly, the Catholic Church in New Zealand was preoccupied with meeting the needs of the settler community. Many of the Catholic settlers were from Ireland, with some from England and Scotland. In the 19th century some were from English &quot;recusant&quot; gentry families, including Sir Charles Clifford, 1st Baronet (first Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives), Frederick Weld (sixth Premier of New Zealand) and their cousin William Vavasour.

The Wellington diocese was divided into three dioceses, with Dunedin (1869) and later Christchurch (1887) being established in the South Island. In 1887, New Zealand became a separate ecclesiastical province. The hierarchy was established with Wellington becoming the archiepiscopal see. In 1900 Holy Cross College, Mosgiel, a national seminary for the training of priests, was opened. In 1907, when New Zealand was created a Dominion, there were 126,995 Catholics out of a total European settler population of 888,578.

===Māori===
After 1850, the Māori mission continued in the Auckland diocese in an attenuated form and could not be revived until after the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s. The survival of the Māori church during the remaining decades of the 19th century was in large part due to Māori catechists – many of them trained at Pompallier&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Seminary. James McDonald was the only missionary to the Māori in the late 1870s. In 1880, Archbishop Steins, the Bishop of Auckland, gave McDonald charge of the Māori mission. In 1886, Bishop John Edmund Luck obtained Mill Hill Fathers for the mission. In spite of inadequate resources, the priests were very active. Some, like Father Carl Kreijmborg, were &quot;builder-priests&quot;, themselves erecting churches. They also started credit unions, piggeries, dairy farms, and co-operative stores. Many of the priests were German or Dutch and they made lifelong commitments to their Māori communities. Some became more proficient in Māori than in English.

In the Wellington diocese the Marists continued their work, to a limited extent, amongst Māori, notably at Ōtaki. Mother Aubert (see below) contributed significantly in Hawke&#x27;s Bay and later in Jerusalem. Catholic secondary schools for Māori were established: St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College, Napier (1867) by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions; Hato Petera College, Northcote (1928) by the Mill Hill Fathers (later staffed by the Marist Brothers who had arrived in New Zealand in 1876); and, in 1948, Hato Paora College was opened by the Marist Fathers. The first Māori Catholic priest, Father Wiremu Te Awhitu was ordained in 1944, and the first Māori Catholic bishop, Bishop Max Mariu was ordained in 1988.

===Religious orders===
Many Catholic religious orders came to New Zealand. The Sisters of Mercy arrived in Auckland in 1850 – the first order of religious sisters to come to New Zealand – and began work in health care and education. The Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions arrived in Napier in 1867. When Patrick Moran arrived as the first Catholic Bishop of Dunedin in February 1871, he was accompanied by ten Dominican nuns from the Sion Hill Convent, Dublin, and they proceeded to establish their schools within days of unpacking. In 1876, the same bishop obtained the services of the Christian Brothers who opened their Dunedin school in that year. In 1880, the Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth came from Bathurst to Whanganui where they opened 7 schools between 1880 and 1900. The Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart arrived in New Zealand in 1883 and established their first community at Temuka, South Canterbury. During the next twenty years Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross), the founder of that congregation, visited New Zealand four times to support her sisters. Suzanne Aubert, who had come to New Zealand in 1860 at the invitation of Bishop Pompallier, and had worked in Auckland and Hawke&#x27;s Bay, established her order the Sisters of Compassion in Jerusalem in 1892 and brought it to New Zealand in 1899. In 1997 the New Zealand Bishops&#x27; Conference agreed to support the &quot;Introduction of the Cause of Suzanne Aubert&quot;, to begin the process of consideration for her canonisation as a saint by the Church. In the 20th century many other orders became established in New Zealand, including the Carmelite nuns in Christchurch and Auckland and the Cistercians in Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

===Development===
The prominence of churches in New Zealand&#x27;s cities, towns and countryside attests to the historical importance of Catholicism in New Zealand.

St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is the cathedral of the Catholic Bishop of Auckland. It is on the original site granted by the Crown to Bishop Pompallier in 1841; it was renovated and re-opened in September 2007. St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral, Dunedin, was constructed between 1878 and 1886. Sacred Heart Cathedral is the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Wellington and was opened in 1901 (in place of the destroyed St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral), although it was not until 1984 that it became officially the cathedral. The highly esteemed Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch, was opened in 1905. The latter three buildings were designed by the prominent New Zealand Catholic architect Francis Petre. In 1947 another seminary, Holy Name Seminary, was opened in Christchurch. The cathedral of the Hamilton Diocese is the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary (built in 1975, rededicated in 1980 and renovated in 2008), and the cathedral of the Palmerston North Diocese is the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (built in 1925, renovated and rededicated in 1980).

===Church today===

Changing social attitudes in the 1950s and 60s and the sweeping changes ushered in by the Second Vatican Council affected the Catholic Church in New Zealand – including in areas of liturgy and church architecture. From 1970 Mass in New Zealand was said in either English or Māori. The iconic Futuna Chapel was built as a Wellington retreat centre for the Marist order in 1961; the design by Māori architect John Scott fused Modernist and indigenous design principles and marked a deviation from traditional church architecture.

On 6 March 1980, the Auckland Diocese and the Wellington Archdiocese were split to create the dioceses of Hamilton and Palmerston North respectively. There have been four New Zealand cardinals, of which all four held the position, successively, of Archbishop of Wellington and Metropolitan of New Zealand: Peter McKeefry, Reginald Delargey, Thomas Stafford Williams and current archbishop John Atcherley Dew.
Pope John Paul II became the first pope to visit New Zealand, in November 1986. He was given an official state welcome, and presided at ceremonies attended by thousands. He called for respect between cultures in New Zealand:

In 2001, the Pope transmitted an apology for injustices done to the indigenous peoples of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, and asked for forgiveness where members of the church had been or still were party to such wrongs. The apostolic exhortation also condemned incidents of sexual abuse by clergy in Oceania.

===Sexual abuse cases===

Of New Zealand Catholic diocesan clergy, 14% have been accused of improper behaviour (either fiscal, sexual abuse, psychological abuse or neglect) since 1950. There were 835 reported cases of alleged sexual child abuse since 1950. From the 1990s, cases of abuse within the Catholic Church and other child care institutions began to be exposed in New Zealand. There were &quot;at least three priests&quot; convicted and several were criticised for allowing abuse to continue. The abuse was on a much lower scale than in Australia and many other countries because the Catholic Church had &quot;a less prominent role in education and social welfare&quot;. In 2000 the Church acknowledged and apologised for the abuse of children by clergy, putting in place protocols and setting up a national office to handle abuse complaints.

==Demographics==
In the 2013 census, 47.65 percent of the population identified themselves as Christians, while another 41.92 percent indicated that they had no religion and around 7 percent affiliated with other religions. The main Christian denominations are: Catholics (12.61 percent); Anglicans (11.79 percent), Presbyterians (8.47 percent), and Christians not further defined (5.54 percent). The 2013 census has shown an actual decline in Catholic adherents with a fall of some 16,000 members. However, the 2013 census also showed that the decline in the membership of the mainline non-Catholic denominations was greater, and that the Catholic Church had become the largest New Zealand Christian denomination, passing the Anglican Church for the first time in history. The percentage of Catholics in the 1901 census was 14 percent, though at that time the church was only the third largest denomination.

Regionally, the West Coast and Taranaki have the largest proportion of Catholics: 16.8 percent and 15.5 percent respectively at the 2013 census. Meanwhile, Tasman and Gisborne have the lowest proportion of Catholics at 7.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.

Approximately 25 percent of New Zealand Catholics regularly attend Sunday Mass compared to 60 percent in the late 1960s. In recent times numbers of priests, nuns and brothers have declined, and the involvement of laypeople has increased. There are 530 priests and 1,200 men and women religious. In 2024, there were 18 men training to be priests at Holy Cross Seminary.

==Social and political engagement==

Catholic organisations in New Zealand are involved in community activities including education; health and care services; chaplaincy to prisons, rest homes, and hospitals; social justice and human rights advocacy. Catholic charities active in New Zealand include the St Vincent de Paul Society and Caritas Aotearoa New Zealand.

===Education===

The first Catholic School in New Zealand was opened in 1840, the year the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, at Kororareka, and was called St Peter&#x27;s School. Initially Catholic missionaries, led by Bishop Pompallier, focused on schools for Māori. It was therefore Catholic laymen who in 1841 established a school for the sons of settlers. This school was Auckland&#x27;s first school of any sort. In 1877, the new central government passed a secular &quot;Education Act&quot; and the Catholic Church decided to establish its own network of schools. The system expanded rapidly. However, by the early 1970s, the Catholic system was on the brink of financial collapse trying to keep up with the post-WWII baby boom, suburban expansion, extension of compulsory education from six to nine years, and smaller class sizes. In 1975, the Third Labour Government passed the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act, which allowed the financially strapped Catholic school system to integrate into the state system. This means the school could receive government funding and keep its Catholic character in exchange for having the obligations of a state-run school, such as teaching the state curriculum. The land and buildings continue to be owned by the local bishop or a religious order and are not government-funded; instead parents pay &quot;attendance dues&quot; for their upkeep. Between 1979 and 1984, all but one Catholic school integrated into the state system.

In June 2013, there were 190 Catholic primary schools in New Zealand and 50 secondary schools. Around 86,000 students were enrolled in 2015, or just under 10 percent of all students in the New Zealand school system. About 78 percent of New Zealand Catholic children attend Catholic schools. Academically, the schools do very well. Between 1994 and 2010, the rolls in Catholic schools increased by almost 22 percent. The New Zealand Catholic Education Office (NZCEO) assists in the running of Catholic schools in New Zealand.

===Politics===
In 1853 Charles Clifford and his cousin Frederick Weld were elected members of the 1st New Zealand Parliament. Both were from old English Catholic recusant families, and were educated at Stonyhurst College. Clifford was chosen as the first speaker of the House in 1854. Weld was a government minister from 1860, premier from 1864, and was later appointed governor of several British colonies (Western Australia, Tasmania, and the Straits Settlements). Henry William Petre was a member of the Legislative Council from 1853 to 1860; his father William Petre, 11th Baron Petre was chairman of the New Zealand Company, and also from the old recusant Petre family.

In 1906 Liberal politician Joseph Ward, a Catholic, became prime minister. Ward was Australian-born and came from an Irish Catholic family. His political success was evidence 
that a Catholic could rise to the highest position in the land. New Zealand Catholics were strongly represented in early Labour politics, which shared their dislike for the Protestant Political Association and supported Irish Home Rule. In 1922, Bishop James Liston publicly rejoiced at Labour&#x27;s electoral gains: &quot;Thanks be to God, the Labour people, our friends, are coming into their own – a fair share in the Government of the country.&quot; In 1935, New Zealanders elected a Labour government led by another Catholic prime minister, Michael Joseph Savage. Later prime ministers Jim Bolger and Bill English were practising Catholics while serving in office.

In the later 20th century, many Catholics took up justice and peace causes in their own communities, as well as nationally and internationally. New Zealand Catholics led protests against apartheid during the Springbok tour of 1981.

Church leaders have often involved themselves in political issues in areas they consider relevant to Christian teachings. Recent political engagement by New Zealand bishops have included statements issued in relation to: the anti-nuclear movement; Māori rights and Treaty of Waitangi settlements; the rights of refugees and migrants; and promoting restorative justice over retributive justice in New Zealand.

In March 2013, Catholic bishops wrote to members of Parliament to state their strong objections to the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, which legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. The letter expressed concern that &quot;state pressure will eventually be brought to bear against people’s freedom of conscience and speech.&quot;

==Dioceses and bishops==

There is one Roman Catholic metropolitan archdiocese and five suffragan dioceses in New Zealand.
New Zealand is also covered by three Eastern Catholic eparchies: the Melkite Eparchy of Saint Michael the Archangel (based in Sydney, Australia), the Chaldean Eparchy of Oceania (Sydney) and the Ukrainian Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul (Melbourne, Australia).

<text>Epping is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Whittlesea local government area. Epping recorded a population of 33,489 at the 2021 census.

== Boundaries and terrain ==

Epping is bounded by Mill Park and Lalor to the south, Somerton to the west, South Morang to the east and Wollert to the north.

Epping has a mainly flat terrain though, towards the north, lie several large hills, which provide an excellent view of Melbourne. McDonalds Road and High Street are the main thoroughfares. The majority of commercial activity is located on High Street and Cooper Street, where Pacific Epping is located.

==History==

A village reserve was surveyed in 1839, where Epping later developed. The village was named Epping, after Epping Forest, in 1853, by which time a hotel (from 1844) and a Catholic school were established. Epping Post Office opened on 1 September 1857. The Epping Road Board was established a year later. In 1870, the area around Epping became Darebin Shire, which was renamed Epping Shire in 1893, until it was united with Whittlesea Shire in 1915. By the time the Shire was created, Epping township contained several churches, hotels and a state school, as well as church school. Farmers of Irish origin predominated, but English, Scots and Germans settled there. There were several dairy farms. The Melbourne to Whittlesea railway (1889–1960) had a station at Epping, and the main areas to benefit were the transport of milk and quarry products.

The original Epping township is on higher ground west of the Darebin Creek (the Catholic Church being the only one not to have moved from lower flood-risk land). Several older buildings are constructed in bluestone, plentiful in the surrounding volcanic plains.

Major suburban development took place from the 1970s onwards, and the northern fringes of the area are currently in the process of being developed for housing.

During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, Epping was one of the more heavily affected areas of Melbourne, as it was host to several large virus outbreaks, including the Epping Gardens Aged Care outbreak, which claimed the lives of 38 elderly residents during the second wave in Melbourne.

In 2022, Major Road Projects Victoria are implementing the Epping Road upgrade, which includes adding extra lanes, new traffic lights, upgrading existing intersections and pedestrian lights, building a new shared walking and cycling path, adding on-road bicycle lands and installing safety barriers along the road.

==Facilities==
One of Melbourne&#x27;s many shopping centres, Pacific Epping, is located away from the Epping railway station. The Northern Hospital adjoins it. Dalton Village is a small shopping centre which is located on Dalton Road in Epping. There are many parks and reserves located throughout the suburb. 

A public library click and collect service operates five days a week, with regular storytime sessions at the Galada Community Centre Hub. It is manged by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. Their mobile library also stops weekly in Epping.

==Education==

There are several government and private schools in Epping, including one of the biggest Catholic High Schools in Australia; St Monica&#x27;s College, and the second largest public school in Victoria; Mill Park Secondary College, with its senior campus located in the east of Epping, as well as Epping Secondary College and Lalor North Secondary College. Primary schools include Epping Primary School, opening in 1872, Epping Views Primary School, Greenbrook Primary School, Meadow Glen Primary School and St Peter&#x27;s Primary School.

Melbourne Polytechnic has a campus at Epping, which was developed in 1992 with State Government funding. Along with Melbourne Polytechnic rural training centres of &quot;Northern Lodge&quot; Equine Stud farm at Eden Park, a farm at Yan Yean and the Growling Frog Vineyard, the Epping campus of Melbourne Polytechnic is the largest provider in Victoria of training to the agriculture sector, offering courses from certificate to bachelor&#x27;s degree level in Aquaculture, Equine Studies, Agriculture and Land Management and Viticulture and Winemaking. A new Green Skills Centre, built in 2009/2010, provides courses and training in renewable energy, sustainable design and building and construction.

<text>Lalor () is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whittlesea local government area. Lalor recorded a population of 23,219 at the 2021 census.

Lalor was named in honour of Peter Lalor, a leader of the Eureka Stockade rebellion and later a member of the Victorian parliament. The suburb was named after the Peter Lalor Home Building Co-operative Society. In recent times, the mispronunciations has become predominant, whilst the Federal electorate of Lalor is still predominantly pronounced .

The eastern and western borders of Lalor are defined by Darebin Creek and Merri Creek respectively.

==History==

Lalor was originally a part of Thomastown. In 1945, Leo Purcell, while a patient at a military hospital on the Atherton Tableland, worked out a scheme to provide low-cost homes, that in February 1947 became known as the &quot;Peter Lalor Co-operative Family Scheme&quot;, and with a group of ex-servicemen, formed the &quot;Peter Lalor Home Building Co-operative Society&quot;. The scheme was sponsored by the ex-servicemen&#x27;s committee of the central executive of the Victorian Labor Party. They chose two hundred and fifty-eight acres east of today&#x27;s Lalor railway station to be the site of the new developments, and the town planner Saxil Tuxen was hired to design a garden suburb.

Lalor Post Office was opened on 1 August 1949.

Although the Co-operative succeeded in beginning a program of house building, under-capitalization resulted in the venture being taken over by the War Service Homes Commission in 1954.

Originally built as the Mentone Fire Station, on the corner of Brindisi Street and Mentone Parade in Mentone in 1906, the building was relocated to 24 Vasey Street, Lalor, in 1957, to become the Lalor Fire Station. The Station was opened 30 January 1958, and was closed in 1997, and now served by the Epping Fire Station.

In 2010, Stockade Park was redeveloped. This site, enclosed by Paschke Crescent and leading to Rochdale Square, marks the location of the Peter Lalor home building co-operative&#x27;s &quot;Stockade&quot; — an area that housed the tools and materials for the workers of the Co-operative that built Lalor.

Lalor Primary School was built on land owned by the Evans family, and held its 50th anniversary in 2004. Several of the surrounding streets are named after members of the Evans family (Evans Street, Ruth Street).

Lalor has two Catholic primary schools: St. Luke&#x27;s Primary School Lalor, established in 1961, and St Catherine&#x27;s Primary School, established in 1983.

Retailers consist of many small specialty shops, as well as Coles and Woolworths supermarkets.

The Mann farmhouse, &quot;Bella Vista&quot;, stood just north of the Lalor Library in May Road.

<text>Thomastown is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km driving distance (14km line of sight) approximately 30 minutes north of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Whittlesea local government area. Thomastown recorded a population of 14,234 at the .

Thomastown is known for sharing its area with Westgarthtown, a historical settlement.

==History and development==
Thomastown came into existence in 1848 when the John Honniball Thomas and Mary née Hartnell family bought 106 acres, the land north of Melbourne for market gardening. Two years later, William Westgarth bought land north of Thomas&#x27; holding, which he made way for German settlers. Thomastown Post Office opened on 9 June 1862.
The Thomastown area attracted many farmers and much horse-racing until World War II. In 1889, the Epping railway line opened and milk production and distribution grew during the 1930s when a German dairying family formed the Pura Dairy, ultimately to expand into Preston and became Metropolitan Dairies Pty. Ltd. In 1947, a housing co-operative was formed 2 km. north in the suburb of Lalor. Soon, residential development began at Thomastown. While German settlers already call this area home, more settlers moved in, mostly Italians, Macedonians and Greeks. In 1961 St. Clare&#x27;s Primary School opened, followed by Thomastown Secondary College and then Thomastown West Primary School.

==Modern Thomastown==
Thomastown has a strip shopping centre in High Street parallel to the Thomastown Railway Station, a shopping centre corner of Edgars Road and Main Street and shops on Settlement Road and Dalton Road, plus various shopping strips east of the train station. Thomastown Secondary College is located on Main Street, adjacent to Thomastown West Primary School, Thomastown Recreational and Aquatic Centre (TRAC) and Thomastown Library which is managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. Thomastown East has a grid street configuration, predating the later configuration in Thomastown West which protects residential streets from through traffic. On the south of Thomastown there are numerous factories and an electricity terminal station, near the Metropolitan Ring Road / Northern Ring Road. There is also the Hume Freeway, which is west of Thomastown.

The Galada Tamboore Path to the west and the Metropolitan Ring Road Trail to the south provide facilities for recreational and commuting cyclists. Edgars Creek and the Edgars Creek Trail runs along a linear park which is next to a reserve with ovals.

Each year around March the community unite for the annual Whittlesea Community festival, a festival that showcases local culture through live entertainment, food stalls, hand made crafts and fireworks finale. The festival is held at the Barry Road parklands in Thomastown.

Thomastown is also the home to Select Harvests corporate offices and one of its two almond processing plants.

Thomastown Mosque was built (early 1990s) by the Turkish Australian community and is located opposite the train station.

==Thomastown railway station==
Thomastown railway station opened on 23 December 1889. It was originally a single platform railway station located on High Street between Main Street and Spring Street. Thomastown railway station is directly linked to the City via the Mernda line. In 2011, the station was upgraded. A second platform, 310 parking spaces for cars, and a pedestrian overpass to cross over to the second platform were all added as were lifts for the disabled and new Myki card systems which replaced the old ticket system.

==Sport==
Thomastown has 5 sporting ovals scattered to each side of Thomastown. These include the Nick Ascenzo Park located off Boronia Street, Thomastown East Recreational Reserve located off Rowen Street, HR Uren Reserve located next to Victoria Drive, West RGC Cook Reserve located on Robinvale Avenue and Main Street Recreational Reserve which is located next to Edgars Creek and TRAC. There is also a Thomastown Football Club, an Australian rules football team, which competes in the Northern Football League.

<text>Whittlesea is a town in Victoria, Australia, north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Whittlesea local government area. Whittlesea recorded a population of 6,117 at the .

==History==

The Post Office opened on 1 September 1853 as Plenty and was renamed Whittlesea in 1864. The town may have been named after Whittlesey, in England. A school opened in a single stone building in 1878 and is to this day the home to Whittlesea Primary School.

The railway to Whittlesea was opened on 23 December 1889 as an extension to what is now the Mernda line, and closed in December 1959.

When the original railway was in operation Whittlesea had a large logging trade, taking the timber from Kinglake, Whittlesea region toward greater Melbourne for milling. There were later two saw mills in operation. At its timber producing peak Whittlesea had several pubs to help house the temporary timber workers.

On 7 February 2009 and subsequent days thereafter, Whittlesea acted as a focal point of for firefighting and relief efforts during the Black Saturday bushfires. In a firefighting context Whittlesea Fire Station and its members play an important role in managing firefighting operations around the Mount Disappointment and Kinglake areas. The township also acted as a focal point for relief efforts, attracting support from the larger Victorian and Australian communities.

==Today==

Although located only a few kilometres from the outer fringes of metropolitan Melbourne, Whittlesea lies outside the Urban Growth Boundaries of the Melbourne 2030 metropolitan development plan. It is therefore expected to maintain its status as a separate town until 2030 and beyond. City of Whittlesea planning policy for Whittlesea township envisages minimal growth over the next decade so that the township will retain its rural character.

The town has a local volunteer (CFA) fire brigade as well as a limited hours Police station. On 22 January 2009 Health Minister Daniel Andrews opened an ambulance station in Whittlesea. This station operates between the hours of 10 am and 10 pm daily. This was a 2006 state election promise made by the Bracks Labor Government.

Local attractions include the Funfields Theme Park, Torourrong Reservoir, Yan Yean Reservoir, Bear&#x27;s Castle and the old Courthouse (now a tourist information centre).

<text>John Stewart Barry (January 29, 1802– January 14, 1870) was the fourth and eighth governor of Michigan. He was Michigan&#x27;s only three-term governor in the 19th century. His main accomplishment was to rationalize state finances after the state&#x27;s internal improvements fiasco.

==Early life in New Hampshire and Vermont==
Barry was born in Amherst, New Hampshire, to John and Ellen (Steward) Barry. While he was young, the family moved to Rockingham, Vermont, where he worked on his father&#x27;s farm and received an education in the local schools. He married Mary Kidder, of Grafton, Vermont, and in 1824 went to Georgia, Vermont, where he taught school while studying law. He began to practice law, and while in Georgia he was also a member of the Governor’s staff. Barry was of primarily English ancestry but was also partially of Welsh descent. The bulk of his immigrant ancestors came to New England from England as Puritans in the 1630s and 1640s. Out of his 32 great-great-great grandparents, 31 of them were from Puritans from England and 1 of them was an Anglican from Montgomeryshire, Wales.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
In 1831, he moved to White Pigeon, Michigan, where he became a merchant and was active in politics. In 1834, Barry moved to Constantine, Michigan, and opened a general store in that village&#x27;s first frame-built building. He became justice of the peace in 1831 while in White Pigeon and continued until 1835. Barry was a prominent participant from the 13th district in the 1835 convention that drafted Michigan&#x27;s first constitution.

When Michigan became a state of the Union in 1837, Barry was a state senator (1836, 1840) and was recognized as a leader of the state Democratic Party. In 1840, Barry became deeply interested in the cultivation of the sugar beet and visited Europe to obtain information in reference to its culture.

==4th and 8th Governor of Michigan==
He was selected by the Democratic Party to run for governor in 1841. He won that election and was reelected in 1843.

During Barry&#x27;s first term, the University of Michigan first opened for students in 1841 in Ann Arbor after moving there from Detroit. The Michigan Central and Michigan Southern Railroads greatly expanded. In 1845, at the end of his second term, the population of the state was more than 300,000.

After a hiatus, the popular Barry was again elected governor in 1849, serving from 1850 to 1852, becoming the first Michigan governor to serve non-consecutive terms. During Barry’s third term the Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University) was established in Ypsilanti. A new state constitution was adopted in 1850. He was defeated in his 1854 run for the reelection and again ran unsuccessfully in 1860.

He also ran unsuccessfully to be a U.S. Representative from Michigan’s 2nd congressional district in 1856 against Republican Henry Waldron.

Throughout his career, he was a supporter of the Wilmot Proviso, intended to stop the spread of slavery, but he remained a member of the Democratic Party, becoming sympathetic with the &quot;ultra&quot; wing during the Civil War. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1856 and 1864.

==Retirement and death==
Barry retired to private life after the beginning of the ascendancy of the Republican Party during Reconstruction, and carried on his mercantile business at Constantine. He died at age 67, his wife&#x27;s death having occurred a year previous, on March 30. .

Barry&#x27;s home in Constantine, the Governor John S. Barry House, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.

<text>Blue Murder were an English hard rock band led by guitarist-vocalist John Sykes. The group was formed in 1987 following Sykes&#x27;s dismissal from Whitesnake. The initial line-up was rounded out by bassist Tony Franklin and drummer Carmine Appice. In its nascent stage, vocalist Ray Gillen and drummer Cozy Powell were attached to the project. In 1989, Blue Murder released their self-titled debut album, which cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and spawned a minor hit with &quot;Jelly Roll&quot;. Nevertheless, the record proved to be a financial disappointment for both the band and their label Geffen Records.

By the early 1990s, Blue Murder&#x27;s style of music had fallen out of fashion with the popularity of grunge. Coupled with the slow progress on a follow-up album, Franklin and Appice chose to leave the band, leaving Sykes to put together a new line-up. In 1993, Blue Murder released &quot;Nothin&#x27; But Trouble&quot;, which failed to chart outside of Japan. After a live album the following year, Blue Murder were dropped by their record label and broke-up. In the years since, there were numerous failed attempts to reunite the band until Sykes&#x27; death in 2024.

Despite their limited commercial success, Blue Murder and their first album in particular have accumulated a small cult following.

==History==
=== Formation and debut album (1987–1989) ===
In 1986, guitarist John Sykes was fired from the English hard rock group Whitesnake by vocalist David Coverdale. Sykes had just finished recording the band&#x27;s eponymous album, which would go on to achieve multi-platinum status. He returned to his home in Blackpool, England, where he began writing new songs. In February 1987, he started putting together a new group. Drummer Cozy Powell was the first to join, having played with Sykes in Whitesnake from 1984 to 1985. Next came bassist Tony Franklin, formerly of The Firm, and lastly vocalist Ray Gillen, who had previously fronted Black Sabbath for a short time.

After solidifying their initial line-up, the band recorded some demos and sent them to Geffen Records with whom Sykes had previously worked with as a member of Whitesnake. Prior to this, Sykes had sent Geffen his first demo recordings, which featured him on lead vocals. As it happened, Geffen&#x27;s A&amp;R executive John Kalodner preferred Sykes&#x27;s vocals to Gillen&#x27;s, who were having disagreements over the songs&#x27; musical and vocal approach. Eventually, Gillen left after only a few months in the band. In mid-1987, the group signed with Geffen Records, but as they began searching for a new lead singer, Cozy Powell abruptly left in early 1988 to join Black Sabbath, having grown frustrated with the band&#x27;s slow progress. They were then approached by drummer Carmine Appice, who had previously played with Rod Stewart, Vanilla Fudge and King Kobra, among others. Also in the running was former Journey drummer and Sykes&#x27;s ex-Whitesnake bandmate Aynsley Dunbar, but ultimately the job went to Appice. In January 1988, former Black Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin had been chosen as the band&#x27;s new lead singer, but as they were about leave for Vancouver to record their debut album, Martin pulled out. The rest of the group decided to soldier on, figuring they could always find a singer later.

In February 1988, the band began recording their debut album with producer Bob Rock. At the same time, they continued to audition singers, among them David Glen Eisley and Derek St. Holmes. Unable to find a singer that satisfied all parties, the band and John Kalodner persuaded Sykes to sing lead vocals. At Franklin&#x27;s suggestion, the band were dubbed Blue Murder, after the British idiom &quot;scream blue murder&quot;. Their debut album, eponymously titled &quot;Blue Murder&quot;, was released on 24 April 1989. It debuted at number 172 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually peaking at number 69 in June 1989. On the UK Albums Chart, it reached number 45. The record received positive reviews, with &quot;Raw&quot;″s Paul Suter giving it a ten out of ten rating and calling it one of &quot;the finest records in an age&quot;. The single &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; also proved to be a minor hit, reaching number fifteen on the Album Rock Tracks chart. In support of their debut album, Blue Murder toured America supporting Bon Jovi and Billy Squier, with additional headline dates in America and Japan.

While their debut album would go on to sell an estimated 500,000 copies by Sykes&#x27;s account, Blue Murder&#x27;s success fell short of expectations. Carmine Appice stated that the decision to release &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot; as the band&#x27;s first music video was a mistake, as it was deemed too long and not &quot;commercial enough&quot; for MTV. The song was also not available for purchase as a single, something Franklin felt hurt its success on MTV. Due to the failure of &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;, MTV refused to play the follow-up video &quot;Jelly Roll&quot;, which Franklin felt prevented it from becoming a crossover hit. Additionally, Sykes felt that Geffen did not properly promote the band, stating: &quot;I think they were trying to get me and David [Coverdale] back together. They wanted me to get back with the &#x27;winning formula&#x27;. But the wounds were too fresh. I stayed with the same label. In hindsight, I would have done better with a different label.&quot;

=== Decline and dissolution (1990–1994) ===

According to Appice and Franklin, Sykes was deeply affected by the failure of Blue Murder&#x27;s debut album, which led to a prolonged period of inactivity. Meanwhile, grunge became popular in the mainstream, which left groups such as Blue Murder, as Franklin put it, &quot;out of vogue&quot;. Though Sykes did eventually start work on a new album, progress was slow. This was partly due to Sykes producing the record himself for which he built an entirely new home studio. Appice grew tired of waiting and left the group in December 1990. He was briefly replaced by former Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Anders Johansson. Franklin announced his departure from Blue Murder in August 1991. Sykes then recruited bassist Marco Mendoza and drummer Tommy O&#x27;Steen to the group, while keyboardist Nik Green was promoted to a full-time member, having already played on the band&#x27;s debut album. However, Franklin had already laid down tracks for Blue Murder&#x27;s second album, while Carmine Appice was brought back briefly as a session drummer. Sykes also recruited former Baton Rouge vocalist Kelly Keeling as a second guitarist, but he reportedly left the band a day before shooting a new music video.

Blue Murder released &quot;Nothin&#x27; But Trouble&quot; on 31 August 1993. The record received positive reviews, though it was perceived by critics as a step-down from the band&#x27;s debut. The single &quot;We All Fall Down&quot; reached number 35 on the Album Rock Tracks chart, but the record itself failed to chart outside of Japan. Sykes once again attributed this to Geffen, who he felt &quot;didn&#x27;t do anything&quot; to promote the record. In 1994, the band released the live album &quot;Screaming Blue Murder: Dedicated to Phil Lynott&quot;, which was recorded in Tokyo. Having fulfilled their contractual obligations to their label, Blue Murder were dropped by Geffen. Sykes signed to Mercury Records in Japan, taking Mendoza and O&#x27;Steen with him to play in his solo band.

=== Failed reunion and Sykes&#x27;s death (2000–2025)===
There were numerous attempts to reunite Blue Murder over the years. According to Carmine Appice, he made several attempts to reunite the group between 2000 and 2012 to no avail. When asked in a 2001 interview if there will be another Blue Murder album, Sykes responded: &quot;Maybe at some point there will be. I don&#x27;t know.&quot; In 2019, Carmine Appice revealed that the group had rehearsed together, but Sykes wanted the band to tour under the moniker John Sykes &amp; Blue Murder, something Appice was unwilling to do. In 2020, Appice stated that he and Sykes had once again talked about the possibility of a Blue Murder reunion, but nothing came of the conversation.

Sykes died after a battle with cancer at age 65, which was announced on his social media via a statement on 20 January 2025.

== Musical style and legacy ==
Blue Murder have been described by music critics as hard rock, heavy metal, and glam metal. Sykes described the band&#x27;s sound in a 1989 interview with &quot;Raw&quot; as a combination of Whitesnake, Thin Lizzy and the blues. Speaking to &quot;Metal Shock&quot;, he referred to the group&#x27;s sound as &quot;heavy funk&quot;. With &quot;Blue Murder&quot;, Sykes sought to create a heavier record than Whitesnake&#x27;s eponymous album, while still retaining much of the same groove and vibe. He would later speculate that this heaviness might have contributed to the album&#x27;s low sales.

Despite Blue Murder&#x27;s short lifespan, the band and their first album in particular have gained a small cult following. Radio and television personality Eddie Trunk highlighted the group in his 2011 book &quot;Eddie Trunk&#x27;s Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal&quot;, while White Wizzard&#x27;s Jon Leon named &quot;Blue Murder&quot; one of his favourite obscure heavy metal records of the 1980s. Alter Bridge&#x27;s Myles Kennedy stated in 2014: &quot;These days there’s a whole Brotherhood Of Blue Murder out there – musicians and crew guys who love this band. You’d be surprised how many of us there are.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic remarked in his retrospective review of the band&#x27;s first album how it has &quot;endured far better than most similarly styled heavy metal albums of the era&quot;. He also touted the production as one of Bob Rock&#x27;s best alongside his work with Metallica. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked &quot;Blue Murder&quot; the sixth best album produced by Bob Rock, while MetalSucks included it on a list of essential hair metal albums not included on a similar list by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

<text>The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, or China–North Korea Friendship Bridge, is a bridge across the Yalu or Amnok River on the China–North Korea border. It connects the cities of Dandong in China and Sinuiju of North Korea, by railway and roadway but pedestrians are not allowed to cross between either side. The bridge serves as one of the few ways to enter or leave North Korea.

It was renamed to its current name from the Yalu (Amnok) River Bridge in 1990. The bridge was constructed by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) between April 1937 and May 1943 during its occupation of Korea and its puppet state of Manchukuo (now northeast China). Further downstream, construction work on the New Yalu River Bridge began in October 2010.

== Background and history == 
Approximately downstream of this bridge are the remains of an older bridge, now known as the Yalu River Broken Bridge, which was opened to traffic between China and Korea in October 1911. This was later supplemented with the more modern bridge, which became operational in 1943. Both bridges were attacked and bombed by American military aircraft throughout most of the Korean War. From November 1950 to February 1951, the United States Air Force (USAF) used B-29 heavy bombers and F-80 fighter-bombers to repeatedly attack and destroy the bridges in an attempt to cut off the flow of Chinese military and troop supplies to the badly weakened North Korean armed forces as well as their own forces fighting alongside them there. Despite the serious difficulties present, the bridges were repeatedly repaired (largely by China). The older bridge from 1911 was left in ruins following its destruction at the hands of the USAF (with North Korea allegedly claiming it would serve as a piece of hard evidence of the US military&#x27;s destruction of the bridge) and only the newer bridge from 1943 was repaired once again and put back into use at the end of the war in 1953.

== Tourism == 

The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge and the Broken Bridge are flanked on the Chinese side by parks and promenades which make up the Yalu (Amnok) River Scenic Area. This is a major tourist attraction in China and is rated AAAA on China&#x27;s national tourist scale. Tourist boats leave from the side of the bridge, allowing visitors to view both bridges and the Dandong riverfront, and pass close to the North Korean waterfront.

<doc id="615249" wikidata="Q6779988" url="?curid=615249" title="Mary Katherine Gallagher">
<text>Mary Katherine Gallagher is a fictional character invented and portrayed by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Molly Shannon from 1995 to 2001. She was considered the first breakout character from the new 1995 cast and a significant marker of the increased influence of women writers on the show in the 1990s. Shannon portrayed the character in a 1999 film, &quot;Superstar&quot;, and she also reprised the role when she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2007. Shannon first created an early version of the character when she was in school at NYU, during a comedy show directed by Madeleine Olnek. In 2024, she portrayed the character in a pre-taped video with Vice President Kamala Harris that was shown at the Al Smith Dinner.

==Character==
Mary Katherine is a sardonic caricature of an unpopular, teenage Catholic school girl. She is prone to comically severe mood swings, alternately hyperactive and ponderous. She suffers from stage fright, but is also hyper-competitive (on one occasion, she engages in a sing-off with Whitney Houston) and egomaniacal, believing she is a &quot;superstar&quot;.

Lacking in proper social skills, her signature move is that, when nervous, she squeezes her hands under her armpits and then sniffs them. She demonstrates this habit to most new people she meets. She also has a habit of flashing her underwear either accidentally or on purpose.

The sketches usually begin with a school-related dramatic arts function, such as choir practice or school play rehearsals. Mary Katherine runs on stage and introduces herself, and then attempts to participate, monopolizing the spotlight until she loses her cool and does something socially inappropriate.

At some point, she typically announces that her feelings would be best expressed by reciting a monologue, sometimes from a film such as &quot;West Side Story,&quot; or from an obscure TV movie such as &quot;The Betty Broderick Story&quot; starring Meredith Baxter-Birney. While reciting the monologue, she becomes overly dramatic and intensely emotional, to the extent to where others intervene to stop her monologue.

The sketch usually ends with her making a pratfall, such as falling over, crashing into a wall or destroying something. She then jumps up, regains her composure, and extends her hands in the air, proclaiming &quot;Superstar!&quot;

==&quot;Superstar&quot;==
In 1999, a feature-length film, entitled &quot;Superstar&quot;, was released, starring Shannon as Gallagher. Several of her SNL cast mates, including Will Ferrell and Mark McKinney, also appear in the film.

In the film, Mary Katherine lives with her disabled grandmother (an unseen character in the &quot;SNL&quot; skits), who believes Mary Katherine bears a striking resemblance to a young Elizabeth Taylor. Wanting to attract the attentions of Sky, the most attractive boy in school (played by Will Ferrell), Mary Katherine decides to enter the school talent competition. Her grandmother, however, prevents her from pursuing her dreams and forbids her to compete. It is later revealed that she intervened because Mary Katherine&#x27;s parents were stomped to death while participating in a dance competition.

<doc id="615253" wikidata="Q1910459" url="?curid=615253" title="Henley, New Zealand">
<text>Henley is a township on New Zealand&#x27;s Taieri Plains, named after the rowing centre Henley-on-Thames in England. It lies close to the confluence of the Taieri and Waipori Rivers at the eastern edge of the plain, at the foot of a low range of coastal hills. The township lies close to the ecologically significant Sinclair Wetlands, which lie to the west.

Henley is near the south-west extremity of the City of Dunedin, 35 km from the city centre, and close to Lake Waihola, one of the country&#x27;s rowing centres. Henley&#x27;s population is about 250. The town was founded at some point prior to 1880.

The main industry is dairy farming. Henley used to have a cheese factory which later moved to the nearby township of Momona. This was later bought out by the company that became Mainland Cheese. The churches in Henley are Presbyterian and Brethren.

The original Māori name for Henley is Maitapapa. A pre-European Maori settlement lay to the south of Henley, close to the Taieri River.

Henley township is prone to flooding by the Taieri River. SH1 is built on top of the bank that divides the larger Henley area, known as &quot;The flood-free highway&quot;. Henley&#x27;s main road lies roughly parallel to and south of this highway.The two roads are connected to the south at Titri and to the north at Otokia, and a connecting road runs between the two roads, crossing a bridge over the Taeri River close to the centre of the township.

In June 1980 the South Taieri region experienced severe floods that flooded both sides of the highway and extended as far as Dunedin International Airport at Momona. Contributing factors to this were already full wetlands at Lake Waihola with the Taieri and Waipori Rivers both draining into this area. Excessive water from the Lake Mahinerangi dam was also released at this time. This placed significant pressure on the banks causing a breach.

<text>Human Nature are an Australian pop vocal group, which formed in 1989, as a quartet featuring Toby Allen, Phil Burton and brothers, Andrew and Mike Tierney. Originally they were established as a doo-wop group, called the 4 Trax, when the members were schoolmates.

After signing with Sony Music as &quot;Human Nature&quot;, they released their debut album, &quot;Telling Everybody&quot;, in 1996. Four of their albums have reached number one on the ARIA Albums Charts, &quot;Counting Down&quot; (May 1999), &quot;Reach Out: The Motown Record&quot; (November 2005), &quot;Dancing in the Street: The Songs of Motown II&quot; (October 2006) and &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;: Jukebox Vol II&quot; (August 2016). Three other albums reached number two, &quot;Get Ready&quot; (November 2007), &quot;Jukebox&quot; (October 2014), and &quot;Romance of the Jukebox&quot; (August 2018).

Their top 10 hits on the related ARIA Singles Chart are &quot;Wishes&quot; (October 1996), &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; (March 1997), &quot;Everytime You Cry&quot; (duet with John Farnham, October 1997), &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (July 1999), &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (October 1999), &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (November 2000) and &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; (April 2004). Three of their albums received multi-platinum certification from ARIA, while four others have received platinum, with a total shipment of over 1.6 million records in Australia, as of April 2011.

The group have toured both nationally and internationally including as a support act for Celine Dion on her Falling Into You Around the World Tour (March 1996, June 1997) and Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour (1998). They also opened for Michael Jackson on the HIStory World Tour (December 1996, early to mid-1997). At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 they won Highest Selling Album for &quot;Reach Out: The Motown Record&quot;. In May 2009 they began a residency performing a Motown-themed show on the Las Vegas Strip and in April 2014 they completed their 1000th show. In November 2019 Human Nature were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Early career: The 4 Trax===
Human Nature started as the 4 Trax in Sydney in late 1989 when Toby Allen (born 1973) and Phil Burton (born 1974) joined with brothers Andrew Tierney (born 1974) and Michael Tierney (born 1977). They represented Hurlstone Agricultural High School as well as a public school in Sydneys west, in a combined regional schools concert at the Bankstown Town Hall, on 27 November 1989. All four members had choir backgrounds and were inspired by groups from the Motown era, including the Four Tops. In Bankstown, they had sung The Penguins&#x27; hit &quot;Earth Angel&quot;. Andrew later told Megan Riggs of What&#x27;s on Highway Radio that it was the only song they knew and they were encouraged to listen to more Motown groups.

After the elder three members had finished high school, Allen worked as a perfume salesman and studied courses in accounting and geology; Andrew studied physiotherapy for two years; and Burton was studying to be a music teacher. Mike, the youngest member of the group, was doing his Higher School Certificate in his final year of secondary school. The 4 Trax initially gave street performances in the doo-wop style, and after winning some talent quests, they began singing professionally in clubs and built a following. The group sent demo recordings to record labels. On a visit to Sony CEO, Denis Handlin, they performed an &quot;a cappella&quot; version of &quot;People Get Ready&quot;, and landed a contract.

By 1995 the group felt the 4 Trax name was dated, so they brainstormed alternatives: Mike suggested Human Nature. Allen said, &quot;At first we thought it was probably a bit obvious, because it&#x27;s such a well-used term, but then the more we lived with that we realized that it suited us. We were singing &quot;a cappella&quot; at the time, and it represented what we were about: Singing was our human nature.&quot;

===&quot;Telling Everybody&quot; album (1996–1997)===
On 1 March 1996 Human Nature released their first single, &quot;Got It Goin&#x27; On&quot;, which reached No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was co-written by the Tierney brothers with their producer, Paul Begaud. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996 they received their first nomination, for Best Talent for &quot;Got It Goin&#x27; On&quot;. In July 1996, they followed up with &quot;Tellin&#x27; Everybody&quot;, again written by Andrew Tierney, Michael Tierney and producer Paul Begaud, which reached the top 30. The third single, &quot;Wishes&quot; (27 September), peaked at No. 6 and gave them their first platinum certification from ARIA. &quot;Wishes&quot; was co-written by Alan Glass with its producer, Andrew Klippel (ex-member of Euphoria).

They had opened for Celine Dion on the Australian leg of her Falling Into You Around the World Tour in March 1996. They were a support act for the tour&#x27;s European leg: visiting Ireland, England, France, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland in June 1997. They opened for her next world tour, Let&#x27;s Talk About Love, in 1998, at the concerts in South Korea and Japan.

On 2 December 1996, Human Nature released their debut album, &quot;Telling Everybody&quot;, which reached No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for 64 weeks. It also reached the top 100 on both the German and the Japanese Albums Charts. Eight of its twelve tracks were produced by Paul Begaud and the other four by Klippel. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it &quot;brimmed with silky smooth dance-pop and blue-eyed soul.&quot; On the ARIA End of Year Albums Chart it reached No. 11. Christie Eliezer of &quot;Billboard&quot; listed the album at number 9 in his top 10 for the year, declaring that it had &quot;Stunning R&amp;B vocals.&quot; He opined that outside Australia the group&#x27;s &quot;three strongest markets outside are Japan, Germany and Taiwan.&quot;

Human Nature garnered attention from Sony label mate, Michael Jackson: they were an opening act for the Australian leg of the HIStory World Tour in November and December 1996. Mike Tierney told G Mintern of &quot;The Times&quot; in November, &quot;Well its totally amazing, and a real coup for us and a great opportunity to showcase our music to a large number of people.&quot; They continued opening for Jackson on the European leg through early 1997. They sang at venues numbering over 100,000 people, and at Wembley Stadium for three nights. In an interview in July 2009 with Radar Online&#x27;s reporter, Andrew described touring with Jackson: &quot;[it] was an incredible break for us ... We learned so much from seeing him perform that many times and experienced things that have shaped us into the entertainers we are today. He was the ultimate artist and so inspiring.&quot; In April and May 1997 they toured United Kingdom supporting local girl group Eternal. In June 1998 they issued a VHS, &quot;Human Nature – Telling Everybody... The Story&quot;, produced and directed by Ross Wood, which contained footage of their European and Japanese 1997 tours supporting Dion, Jackson and Eternal.

Additional singles from &quot;Telling Everybody&quot; are &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; (March 1997, Peaking at No. 8), &quot;Whisper Your Name&quot; (with both songs having been co-written by Andrew Tierney, Michael Tierney, Paul Begaud) and produced by Begaud. (August, No. 18), and &quot;People Get Ready&quot; (November, top 40). The album achieved triple-platinum status in 1997. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 they received nominations for Best Pop Release and Producer of the Year (Paul Begaud) for &quot;Telling Everybody&quot;, Highest Selling Single for both &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Wishes&quot;, and Breakthrough Artist – Album for &quot;Telling Everybody&quot;. At the ceremony, in September, they debuted their single, &quot;Everytime You Cry&quot;, which was a duet with John Farnham. In the following month Human Nature undertook their own national concert tour.

===&quot;Counting Down&quot; album (1998–1999)===
Human Nature and Farnham&#x27;s duet single, &quot;Every Time You Cry&quot;, peaked at No. 3 and stayed for 15 weeks in the ARIA top 50. The group received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 for Producer of the Year for Paul Begaud&#x27;s work on &quot;Whisper Your Name&quot; and another for Highest Selling Single (with Farnham) for &quot;Every Time You Cry&quot;. They later performed with Farnham on his I Can&#x27;t Believe He&#x27;s 50 Tour in April–May 1999. In December 1998 they supported Janet Jackson&#x27;s tour of Australia.

Their second album, &quot;Counting Down&quot;, was released on 25 May 1999, which consists of sessions recorded in Sydney, London, and Los Angeles, and used the production team from the first album, along with international songwriters and producers. It debuted at Number One (#1) on the ARIA charts, remained in the top 50 for 26 weeks and was certified platinum by the end of the following year. McFarlane described it as &quot;smooth R&amp;B pop&quot;. Eliezer declared that its number-one status &quot;sent the right signal to other territories about the vocal quartet.&quot;

&quot;Every Time You Cry&quot; was included on the album and five other singles charted in the ARIA top 40: &quot;Cruel&quot; (September 1998, No. 1 &quot;Last to Know&quot; (March 1999, No. 14), &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (July, No. 5), &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (October, No. 8) – a cover version of the 1989 hit by The Bangles – and &quot;Be There with You&quot;, the later was again written by the Tierney brothers and Paul Begaud and produced by Begaud. (April 2000, No. 40) Andrew and Michael co-wrote &quot;She&#x27;s Taken My Words&quot; – the B-side for &quot;Last to Know&quot; – which was used as the theme song for Australian feature film, &quot;Paperback Hero&quot; (March 1999). Human Nature were the first Australian group, and as of October 2007, the only one to have six top 40 hits from the one album. All except &quot;Be There with You&quot; received gold certification in Australia.

Human Nature appeared in an Australian concert tour of symphonic versions of Beatles&#x27; songs, conducted by George Martin. In October 1999 they had roles in a stage version of &quot;Happy Days: The Arena Mega-Musical&quot;, playing a 1950s vocal group, the Naturals. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 they were nominated for Best Pop Release for &quot;Counting Down&quot;; Producer of the Year (Paul Begaud) for &quot;Now That I Found You&quot;, &quot;Depend on Me&quot;, &quot;Last to Know&quot;, &quot;Be There with You&quot;; and Highest Selling Single for &quot;Last to Know&quot;.

===Self-titled and greatest hits albums (2000–2003)===
Human Nature&#x27;s third album was eponymously titled and released on 1 December 2000. It was recorded in Sydney, London, Stockholm, Los Angeles and New York. It included &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be a Long Night&quot; which was co-written by the Tierney brothers with Gary Barlow of Take That. Its lead single, &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (November 2000), reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 7 in Australia to become the second best selling Australasian single for that year. Tim Cashmere of Undercover Media described their &quot;clean cut image that appeals to teens with full parental approval.&quot;

On 15 September Human Nature performed the Australian National Anthem at the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics with singer Julie Anthony and musician James Morrison. In November they made a guest appearance on the Australian TV soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, where they sang &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; at Erinsborough High&#x27;s debutante ball, and &quot;Wishes&quot; &quot;a cappella&quot; at the ball&#x27;s after party.

On 16 November 2001 Human Nature released their first greatest hits album, &quot;Here &amp; Now: The Best of Human Nature&quot;, featuring 17 tracks, three of which had not been on previous albums. It reached No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Their single, &quot;Always Be With You&quot;, peaked in the top 30. Its related music video featured a comic character, Guido Hatzis. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; was nominated for Highest Selling Single and Best Video (directed by Mark Hartley).

From August 2002 to early 2003 Allen portrayed the Emcee in a production of the musical, &quot;Cabaret&quot;. He used temporary tattoos and dyed black hair; in a stark contrast to the &quot;clean-cut&quot; image associated with the group. Jo Roberts of &quot;The Age&quot; described how &quot;he prowls around the stage like a wild animal on heat; muscular, handsome and lascivious with dyed black hair, tattoos and androgynous, wet, red lips. He&#x27;s an eye magnet, whether centre stage or lurking in the shadows with an expression of wicked intent.&quot; Allen won a Helpmann Award for his performance. For the duration of the musical play&#x27;s run Human Nature were in hiatus. On 25 June 2003 the group sang the national anthem at Game 2 of the Rugby League State of Origin match at Stadium Australia.

===&quot;Walk the Tightrope&quot;, Motown cover albums (2004–2007)===
Human Nature released their fourth studio album, &quot;Walk the Tightrope&quot;, on 26 April 2004, which reached No. 12. Andrew explained, &quot;With this record, we wanted to take a bit of a chance, do things we haven&#x27;t done before. Break the Human Nature mould.&quot; Cashmere felt that while it is &quot;littered with great vocal harmonization... it&#x27;s just a bummer about the songs... they haven&#x27;t exactly pushed the boundaries of artistic endeavor, but they have once again laid down some magnificent vocals backed by some of the world&#x27;s top production.&quot; Amazon.com&#x27;s editor opined that they &quot;have never sounded better. A blend of Bee Gees groove inspired dance floor tracks, upbeat pop numbers and gorgeous ballads.&quot;

Its first single &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot;, co-written by Darren Hayes (ex-Savage Garden) and Rick Nowels, is a cover version of Clay Aiken&#x27;s album track. In April 2004 it reached No. 7 in Australia. The track, &quot;Love Is Blind&quot;, was written by the Bee Gees in 1998, but it had not been previously released by any artist. The album also features a reworking of &quot;Guilty (One in a Million)&quot; by Barry Gibb and Barbra Streisand, and a cover of &quot;To Be with You&quot;, a 1992 hit by glam metal band Mr. Big. &quot;Guilty&quot; reached the top 40.

In May 2005 Allen portrayed Kenickie in, another musical, &quot;Grease The Arena Spectacular&quot;. John Shand of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; declared that Allen &quot;seemed wasted&quot; in his role.

For their fifth studio album, &quot;Reach Out: The Motown Record&quot; (7 November 2005), the group focused on Motown cover versions. AllMusic&#x27;s Matt Collar found the tracks were &quot;well-produced and reverent reworkings of the original &#x27;60s versions that should appeal to both aficionados of Motown soul and longtime Human Nature fans.&quot; Eliezer, now writing for &quot;In Music &amp; Media&quot;, described it as &quot;nannabait&quot; which provided &quot;something of a late-career revival.&quot; Burton explained their development, &quot;We&#x27;ve gone through the &quot;Telling Everybody&quot; and the boy band phase – as you said – but now we&#x27;re showing everyone how we got to where we are and that&#x27;s by listening to this type of music. It really suits us.&quot;

&quot;Reach Out&quot; debuted at No. 6, and, five weeks later, reached number one on the ARIA Album Chart; it remained in the top 50 for 56 weeks. It peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand – their highest-charting album outside Australia. It received 6× Platinum certification in 2007 from ARIA for shipment of over 420,000 units. In 2006 they performed across Australia on their Motown Show Tour with special guest, Doug Parkinson.

Allen and Burton have each appeared in reality TV shows: Allen in the fourth season of Channel 7&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (May 2006) – finishing third – Burton in the second season of Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Overhaul&quot; (January 2007). Both Allen and Burton appeared on 19 March 2006 episode of Channel 10&#x27;s &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest&quot; series where they competed for the title of Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Musician: Burton won and Allen was a runner-up.

On 29 October 2006 Human Nature won the ARIA Award for Highest Selling Album for &quot;Reach Out: The Motown Record&quot;. It was their first win from 15 nominations in their 18 years together. Andrew jokingly commented that they were the &quot;John Wood&quot; of the ARIAs. Human Nature performed at the ceremony, ARIA provided a summary, &quot;[the] lads delivered a fine medley of Motown hits and, in their sharp blue suits, were easily the best-dressed blokes in the room.&quot;

With the success of &quot;Reach Out&quot;, Human Nature continued with the Motown theme by releasing their sixth studio album, &quot;Dancing in the Street: the Songs of Motown II&quot;, on 13 October 2006. Collar noticed that they &quot;find a nice balance between updating the classic Motown sound for contemporary dance-pop fans while still remaining faithful to the original recordings.&quot; Eliezer reported that with its predecessor &quot;Motown tunes revive Human Nature.&quot; It debuted at number one on the ARIA Album Chart and was certified 3× Platinum for 2006. &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 for Best Selling Album. They followed the album with an Australian arena tour in June and July 2007, with pop singer, Paulini, as the support act.

On 24 November 2007 Human Nature released their third Motown-themed album, &quot;Get Ready&quot;, which featured appearances by several original Motown artists: Smokey Robinson, Martha Reeves and Mary Wilson (The Supremes, The Temptations). Robinson flew to Australia for its release, and performed with the group on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;. The album reached number two on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum. Their three Motown-themed albums, with a total of ten platinum certifications, have shipped over 700,000 copies in Australia.

===American breakthrough (2008–2013)===
In 2008 Human Nature performed for the first time in the United States, with a two-month engagement at Atlantic City&#x27;s Tropicana Casino. In April they performed with Mary Wilson on the Australian TV show, &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, where they sang two duets from their &quot;Get Ready&quot; album: &quot;It Takes Two&quot; and &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;. Sony issued a compilation box set, &quot;The Motor City Collection&quot;, on 19 April 2008 – to coincide with Wilson&#x27;s duets – which peaked at No. 18.

The group teamed up with their previous producer Eliot Kennedy to record their ninth studio album, &quot;A Symphony of Hits&quot;, with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. It was released on 10 November 2008, which peaked at No. 10. Adam Greenberg of AllMusic explained that &quot;[t]he vocals are consistently strong, though they are undeniably of the boy band variety. There&#x27;s melodramatic emotion pumped into everything here. While it works well for some of the ballads (the Bangles&#x27; &#x27;Eternal Flame&#x27; in particular comes off well), it can seem a little much for the bouncier tracks.&quot; They followed in mid-December with three performances at the Sydney Opera House fronting the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Guy Noble. They also performed with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in Melbourne (February 2009), and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in Perth (February–March).

In May 2009 Human Nature became the second Australian group to have a residency on the Las Vegas Strip (The Four Kinsmen were the first, from 1996) when they began a year-long engagement at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. At the premiere of the show, Smokey Robinson Presents: Human Nature, Robinson told &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; reporter, Robin Leach, that &quot;They were bigger than the Beatles in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. I&#x27;ve never met four harder working, finely tuned singers. They are set to become major stars here now, and I&#x27;m proud to present them in Vegas.&quot;

On 12 December they returned to Australia for a homecoming show with Robinson and Jessica Mauboy at the Wyndham Estate winery in the Hunter Region. In May 2010 the Imperial Palace extended the group&#x27;s engagement by two years, and also renamed their venue, as Human Nature Theatre. Las Vegas mayor, Oscar Goodman, also decreed that 11 May 2010 is to be known as Human Nature Day.

Human Nature released their ninth studio album, &quot;&quot;, in November 2010, which reached the ARIA top 30. &quot;Vegas&quot; contains cover versions that are either about the city or have been performed by headliners past and present. It includes a duet with current Vegas headliner, Barry Manilow. On 27 November they performed two Elvis Presley covers, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; and &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, complete with Vegas showgirls, on the final episode of Australian TV show, &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;. They received a presentation award which coincided with their 21st anniversary of performing.

In December 2010 the band embarked on the Direct from Las Vegas! Australian Symphony Tour where they visited five state capital cities and played with the associated state symphony orchestra. Again, they worked with the Sydney, Melbourne, and West Australian Symphony Orchestras. Also, for the first time, they performed with the Adelaide, Tasmanian and Queensland Symphony Orchestras.

In celebration of their 500th show at the Imperial Palace on 30 June 2011, Human Nature recorded a full-length PBS concert special, &quot;Human Nature Sings Motown with Special Guest Smokey Robinson&quot; at the Paris Theatre at Paris Las Vegas on 6–7 July. The special was produced by Ken Ehrlich, and was broadcast in December 2011 on 85% of the country&#x27;s PBS stations. Andrew comments in their article for &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, &quot;Basically, ever since we started working in Vegas, everyone was telling us we should do a PBS special.&quot; and that &quot;We&#x27;d like more people when they arrive in Vegas to have heard of Human Nature.&quot;

On 6 March 2012 Human Nature released a DVD of the PBS concert, and also their first US album, &quot;The Motown Record&quot;, featuring more Motown tracks. Allen told Brian McCollum of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, &quot;Everybody loves (Motown), which is testament to what it achieved. As Berry Gordy would say, they didn&#x27;t seek to make just black music – they wanted to make music for everybody. I look out at our shows, and it&#x27;s people from all over the world, all genders and ages. It&#x27;s pretty remarkable.&quot; and that &quot;to have (Smokey Robinson) get involved so heavily with what we were doing was such a big justification for us, that we were doing something OK with this music and not ruining it.&quot; The album reached number 120 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, but reached number one on the Motown Chart, and number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseeker Chart.

The releases were followed by a 34-city tour to raise money for PBS affiliates and to improve awareness of the group in America. Their first stop, on 24 March, was at Detroit, Michigan, the original home of Motown, at the Fisher Theatre. They were also featured musical guests on 23 April broadcast of the American ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, alongside Motown artists, Robinson, Martha Reeves and the Temptations. The tour included visits to Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston and New York City. For the east coast tour they used their Vegas backing band, the Funk Foundation.

In December 2012 the group toured Australia, again teaming up with symphony orchestras including the Adelaide and Melbourne Symphony Orchestras; they also performed in Sydney and the Gold Coast with Philharmonia Australia.

Human Nature signed a two-year deal with Venetian Hotel and Casino and started residency in January 2013. The group performs the &quot;Smokey Robinson presents Human Nature: The Motown Show&quot; five nights a week at the Sands Showroom.

===&quot;The Christmas Album&quot; &amp; &quot;Jukebox&quot; albums (2013–2018)===

In November 2013 Human Nature released &quot;The Christmas Album&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers. They promoted it with a 10-date Australian tour in December. On 10 April 2014 they played their 1000th show in Vegas, with Robinson joining them on stage. In September they appeared on Australian TV&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise&quot; to promote their concept album, &quot;Jukebox&quot;, featuring cover versions of tracks from the 1950s and 1960s. It debuted at No. 2. In 2016, the band released &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;: Jukebox Vol II&quot;. In August 2018 the band released their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Romance of the Jukebox&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts.

===Order of Australia and ARIA Hall of Fame (2019)===
At the 2019 Australia Day Honours, each of the four members of Human Nature received the Medal of the Order of Australia (General Division), with the citation, &quot;for service to the performing arts as an entertainer.&quot; In April 2019 Human Nature celebrated their 30th anniversary with a Little More Love tour. It provided their biggest live shows and commenced in the Gold Coast and concluded in Sydney. In November of that year the group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and sang a medley of their tracks, &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, and &quot;Everytime You Cry&quot;. A compilation album, titled &quot;Still Telling Everybody: 30 Years of Hits&quot; was released in November 2019 and peaked at number 3 on the ARIA Charts.

On 2 February 2020, the group premiered a brand new single titled &quot;Nobody Just Like You&quot; at the 2020 Australian Open men&#x27;s final.

<doc id="615262" wikidata="Q7798182" url="?curid=615262" title="Thrill killing">
<text>A thrill killing is premeditated or random murder that is motivated by the sheer excitement of the act. While there have been attempts to categorize multiple murders, such as identifying &quot;thrill killing&quot; as a type of &quot;hedonistic mass killing&quot;, actual details of events frequently overlap category definitions making attempts at such distinctions problematic.

Those identified as thrill killers are typically young males, but other profile characteristics may vary, according to Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Conflict and Violence at Northeastern University. The major common denominator among those who commit thrill killings is that they usually feel inadequate and are driven by a need to feel powerful. &quot;To a certain extent, [thrill killers] may make their victims suffer so that they can feel good,&quot; said Levin. &quot;Sadism is fairly common in thrill killings. The killer might torture, degrade, or rape his or her victim before he or she takes his or her life.&quot; They frequently have an &quot;ideal victim type&quot; who has certain physical characteristics.

Thrill killers have been frequently romanticized in films.

== Documented incidents ==
* May 21, 1924: University students Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Bobby Franks. Leopold, aged 19 at the time, and Loeb, 18, believed themselves to be Nietzschean Übermenschen who could commit a &quot;perfect crime&quot; (in this case a kidnapping and murder). Both were sentenced to life imprisonment plus 99 years; Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936, while Leopold was paroled in 1958 after serving 33 years, and died in 1971 of natural causes.
*September 13, 1931: Szilveszter Matuska, a clinically insane man had placed a high explosive charge on a railroad bridge near Biatorbágy, Hungary. The charge was set off under a passenger train headed from Budapest to Vienna, Austria, shortly after midnight, pushing the locomotive and six cars off the bridge. Matuska did not intend to kill anyone in particular; he just wanted to blow up any train that came next for his own amusement. The Budapest–Vienna train involved in the attack was late, and it overtook a freight train which was supposed to reach the bridge before it: 22 people died and 17 were seriously injured. The police found a handwritten note at a disaster site with Communist slogans and threats, and it was assumed that Communists had perpetrated a terrorist attack: the government used this as a pretext to declare martial law, and initiated a police crackdown on the illegal Communist Party of Hungary (KMP). Although Matuska was apprehended in Vienna in October 1931 and confessed to the bombing, martial law remained in effect, and two leading Communists were executed in 1932.
* December 18, 1968 – October 1969: The Zodiac Killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California, US. In cryptic letters he wrote to newspapers, he claimed killing people &quot;is so much fun. It&#x27;s even better than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal. To kill gives me the most thrilling experience. It&#x27;s even better than getting your rocks off with a girl.&quot; There were five confirmed victims, however many more are suspected to have been done by him.
* September 8, 1988: Twenty-year-old bank clerk Janine Balding was abducted from a railway station at Sutherland, New South Wales, Australia by five homeless youths with extensive criminal records, and driven to nearby Minchinbury where she was repeatedly raped by three of the male offenders before being bludgeoned, hog-tied and drowned in a reservoir. The ringleaders, 22-year-old Stephen Wayne &#x27;Shorty&#x27; Jamieson, 16-year-old Matthew James Elliott, and 14-year-old Bronson Matthew Blessington, were arrested the next day and later sentenced to life imprisonment plus 25 years without the possibility of parole; Blessington and Elliott are the youngest offenders to receive this sentence in Australian history.
* September 15, 1990: Debra Holt, the mother of future world champion boxer Kendall Holt, and also known as Debra Holts and &quot;Cocoa Tan&quot;, and three men she met while staying at the Alexander Hamilton Hotel, were convicted of killing a homeless man during an evening of senseless violence and crime in Paterson, New Jersey, US.
* August 19, 1992: Laborer and career criminal Andrew Peter Garforth murdered nine-year-old schoolgirl Ebony Simpson at Bargo, New South Wales, Australia. Garforth snatched Simpson as she walked home from school and threw her in the boot of his car, raped her repeatedly, bound her hands with speaker wire and weighted her schoolbag before throwing her into a dam where she drowned; he also joined the search for Simpson before being arrested. Garforth, who had 76 prior convictions, showed no remorse in court; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 30 years without the possibility of parole, with Justice Peter Newman calling the crime &quot;chilling in the extreme&quot;.
* February 12, 1993: Two ten-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, abducted and murdered toddler James Bulger in Liverpool, England. After skipping school together, Thompson and Venables engaged in a spree of petty criminal activity including shoplifting and vandalism at a local shopping mall before spotting Bulger alone and deciding to abduct him. After leading Bulger away from the mall, the boys took him to a railroad track, where they beat him with rocks and a metal bar before leaving him on the tracks in hopes he would be killed by a train. It was later determined that Bulger died from the beating well before his body was struck by a train. Thompson and Venables were imprisoned for eight years.
* October 29, 1995: Handyman, mechanic, and convicted sex offender Paul Stephen Osborne raped ten-year-old Leanne Oliver and nine-year-old Patricia Leedie before bashing them to death with a tree branch and a wheel jack at Warana Beach, Queensland, Australia. After drinking twelve beers and smoking marijuana at a barbecue, Osborne took the girls to the beach for a swim; Leanne Oliver&#x27;s father, Alby Oliver, found Osborne&#x27;s wallet and the girls&#x27; bodies in sand dunes the next morning, after which Osborne was arrested. When asked by police why he killed the girls, Osborne told police &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know whether I blacked out or went crazy. They seemed pretty nice.&quot; Osborne pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment plus 36 years without the possibility of parole; in sentencing Osborne, Queensland Supreme Court Justice Glen Williams said that he was &quot;beyond redemption&quot;.
* April 19, 1997: American teens, Thomas Koskovich and Jayson Vreeland, ordered a pizza and ambushed two delivery men, Georgio Gallara and Jeremy Giordano, outside of an abandoned house in Franklin, New Jersey, before going bowling. Koskovich and Vreeland told police they wanted to experience what it was like to commit murder.
* July 17, 1997: Jesse McAllister and Bradley Price killed a man and a woman in Seaside, Oregon, US only &quot;to experience it [murder].&quot;
* September 30, 1997: Eighteen-year-old American Todd Rizzo beat to death thirteen-year-old Stanley Edwards using a three-pound sledgehammer, after he lured Edwards with a promise to hunt snakes in his backyard. Rizzo was convicted of the murder in 1999 and sentenced to death, being put on Connecticut&#x27;s death row. Later Rizzo was re-sentenced to life imprisonment.
* October 6, 1997: Bega schoolgirl murders: New Zealand-born career criminal Lindsay Hoani Beckett and Victorian prison escapee Leslie Alfred Camilleri murdered fourteen-year-old Lauren Barry and sixteen-year-old Nichole Collins at Fiddler&#x27;s Green Creek, Victoria, Australia. After accepting an offer of a ride to a party, the girls were abducted, raped and tortured over the next ten and a half hours, before Beckett stabbed them on Camilleri&#x27;s orders; Beckett and Camilleri then drove back to Yass and had breakfast. Beckett pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 35 years in exchange for testifying against Camilleri, who was found guilty and sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment plus 155 years without the possibility of parole. In sentencing the men, Victorian Supreme Court Justice Frank Vincent told Beckett that &quot;You represent the dark in which our women and children fearfully walk&quot;, and told Camilleri that &quot;Through your own actions, you have forfeited your right ever to walk among us again&quot;. Camilleri was sentenced in 2013 to an additional and cumulative 28 years for the murder of fourteen-year-old Prue Bird in Glenroy, Victoria, on February 2, 1992.
* May 25, 2002: In what was described as a &quot;sick game&quot;, Benjamin Sifrit and his wife Erika lured 32-year-old Joshua Ford and his 51-year-old girlfriend Martha &quot;Geney&quot; Crutchley to their Ocean City, Maryland, US, condo and ordered them to disrobe before shooting Ford three times and stabbing Crutchley several times in the abdomen. Their bodies were then dismembered and disposed of in Delaware. After separate trials, Benjamin Sifrit was sentenced to 38 years imprisonment and Erika Sifrit to life imprisonment plus 20 years.
* March 29, 2005: James Patrick Roughan, nephew of convicted killer Katherine Knight, and his friend, Christopher Clark Jones, stabbed and bashed seventeen-year-old Morgan Jay Shepherd over 130 times before decapitating him with an axe in Dayboro, Queensland, Australia, after a lengthy drinking session; Shepherd&#x27;s head was used as a puppet and bowling ball, according to witnesses. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 27 years; three youths who cannot be named because of their age were sentenced to two years detention for helping dispose of the body.
* May 2005-August 2006: Two men in Phoenix, Arizona, US (dubbed &quot;Serial Shooter&quot; by the media), Dale Hausner and Samuel Dieteman, went on a year-long random shooting spree. The murderers referred to their actions as &quot;Random recreational violence&quot;. Eight people were killed in the spree and seventeen injured. Both men were found guilty.
* June 18, 2006: Two sixteen-year-old girls, who cannot be named because of their age, strangled Eliza Jane Davis with electrical cable and buried her body under a vacant house in Collie, Western Australia, Australia, after the three attended a party. The girls told police they knew it was wrong to kill but it &quot;felt right&quot;, and they did not regret Davis&#x27; death. Both girls were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of fifteen years.
* September 22, 2006: High school students Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik murdered their sixteen year old classmate Cassie Jo Stoddart in her aunt and uncle&#x27;s house in Pocatello, Idaho, United States. Draper and Adamcik were given life sentences without the possibility of parole in 2007.
* December 17, 2006: Couple Jessica Ellen Stasinowsky, twenty, and Valerie Paige Parashumti, nineteen, drugged, beat, and strangled their sixteen-year-old flatmate, Stacey Mitchell, before disposing of her body in a wheelie bin in Lathlain, Western Australia. Parashumti and Stasinowsky originally told police that Mitchell had moved to Queensland after an argument, but later confessed to the crime; they had discussed killing people on several occasions. Both women pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 24 years, which was increased to 31 years on appeal under new legislation, at the time the longest non-parole period handed down to a woman in Australian history. Justice Peter Blaxell said that had the women been convicted by a jury, he would have sentenced them to life imprisonment without the possibility of release on parole.
* June 25, 2007 – July 16, 2007: Over the course of three weeks, two young men, Viktor Sayenko and Igor Suprunyuck, murdered 21 people, in Ukraine. No apparent motive for the murders was found. Many photographs and videos were taken by the killers as a &quot;memory&quot; of their brutal spree; one video leaked onto the Internet. Both were sentenced to life in prison.
* March 11, 2009, Winnenden school shooting: Tim Kretschmer killed fifteen and injured nine in his former high school before carjacking a vehicle at gun point from auto mechanic Igor Wolf. When asked by Wolf why he was doing it, he responded &quot;For fun, because it&#x27;s fun&quot;, he went on to say &quot;Do you think we can find another school?&quot;.
* October 4, 2009: Teenagers Steven Spader and Christopher Gribble murdered Kimberly Cates and severely injured her daughter Jamie during a home invasion in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, US. Both were assaulted with a machete; seventeen-year-old Spader admitted hacking Kimberley Cates to death with 36 blows to the head and torso. Spader had formed a club he called &quot;The Disciples of Destruction&quot; shortly before the murder, to which he recruited his confederates. Spader designed a logo with the initials &quot;D.O.D.&quot; Spader told his recruits that the home invasion was to be a rite of &quot;initiation&quot; for club members. Both Spader and Gribble were sentenced to life in prison, while three other accomplices are also serving prison time. Apparently content with his life sentence, Spader informed his attorneys during an April 2013 resentencing hearing that he did not want a reduction in sentence, describing himself as “the most sick and twisted person you’ll ever meet.”
* October 21, 2009: Fifteen-year-old Alyssa Bustamante stabbed and strangled her nine-year-old neighbor Elizabeth Olten. She later wrote in her diary: &quot;I just fucking killed someone. I strangled them and slit their throat and stabbed them now they&#x27;re dead. I don&#x27;t know how to feel atm [at the moment],&quot; adding &quot;It was amazing. As soon as you get over the &#x27;ohmygawd I can&#x27;t do this&#x27; feeling, it&#x27;s pretty enjoyable.&quot; Bustamante had a history of depression and suicide attempts as well as a turbulent domestic situation. Her mother abandoned her as a child and her father was in prison for much of her childhood.
* April 14, 2013: Fifteen-year-old Daniel William Marsh tortured, stabbed, murdered, and mutilated Oliver Northup Jr. and Claudia Maupin in Davis, California. Marsh had long been fantasizing about torturing and murdering people and desired to become a serial killer. He told investigators that the murders gave him a feeling of &quot;pure happiness&quot; which lingered for weeks.
* May 9, 2021: Fourteen-year-old Aiden Fucci murdered his thirteen-year-old classmate, Tristyn Bailey; she was stabbed 114 times. Judge R. Lee Smith characterized Bailey&#x27;s murder as the most shocking case to occur in St. Johns County, Florida, saying that Bailey&#x27;s murder had no motive, and that Fucci murdered his classmate just to feel the sensation of killing.

<text>Deinterlacing is the process of converting interlaced video into a non-interlaced or progressive form. Interlaced video signals are commonly found in analog television, VHS, Laserdisc, digital television (HDTV) when in the 1080i format, some DVD titles, and a smaller number of Blu-ray discs.

An interlaced video frame consists of two fields taken in sequence: the first containing all the odd lines of the image, and the second all the even lines. Analog television employed this technique because it allowed for less transmission bandwidth while keeping a high frame rate for smoother and more life-like motion. A non-interlaced (or progressive scan) signal that uses the same bandwidth only updates the display half as often and was found to create a perceived flicker or stutter. CRT-based displays were able to display interlaced video correctly due to their complete analog nature, blending in the alternating lines seamlessly. However, since the early 2000s, displays such as televisions and computer monitors have become almost entirely digital—in that the display is composed of discrete pixels—and on such displays the interlacing becomes noticeable and can appear as a distracting visual defect. The deinterlacing process should try to minimize these.

Deinterlacing is thus a necessary process and comes built-in to most modern DVD players, Blu-ray players, LCD/LED televisions, digital projectors, TV set-top boxes, professional broadcast equipment, and computer video players and editors—although each with varying levels of quality.

Deinterlacing has been researched for decades and employs complex processing algorithms; however, consistent results have been very hard to achieve.

== Background ==

Both video and photographic film capture a series of frames (still images) in rapid succession; however, television systems read the captured image by serially scanning the image sensor by lines (rows). In analog television, each frame is divided into two consecutive fields, one containing all even lines, another with the odd lines. The fields are captured in succession at a rate twice that of the nominal frame rate. For instance, PAL and SECAM systems have a rate of 25 frames/sec or 50 fields/sec, while the NTSC system delivers 29.97 frames/sec or 59.94 fields/sec. This process of dividing frames into half-resolution fields at double the frame rate is known as &quot;interlacing&quot;.

Since the interlaced signal contains the two fields of a video frame shot at two different times, it enhances motion perception to the viewer and reduces flicker by taking advantage of the persistence of vision effect. This results in an effective doubling of time resolution as compared with non-interlaced footage (for frame rates equal to field rates). However, interlaced signal requires a display that is natively capable of showing the individual fields in a sequential order, and only traditional CRT-based TV sets are capable of displaying interlaced signal, due to the electronic scanning and lack of apparent fixed resolution.

Most modern displays, such as LCD, DLP and plasma displays, are not able to work in interlaced mode, because they are fixed-resolution displays and only support progressive scanning. In order to display interlaced signal on such displays, the two interlaced fields must be converted to one progressive frame with a process known as &quot;de-interlacing&quot;. However, when the two fields taken at different points in time are re-combined to a full frame displayed at once, visual defects called &quot;interlace artifacts&quot; or &quot;combing&quot; occur with moving objects in the image. A good deinterlacing algorithm should try to avoid interlacing artifacts as much as possible and not sacrifice image quality in the process, which is hard to achieve consistently. There are several techniques available that extrapolate the missing picture information, however they rather fall into the category of intelligent frame creation and require complex algorithms and substantial processing power.

Deinterlacing techniques require complex processing and thus can introduce a delay into the video feed. While not generally noticeable, this can result in the display of older video games lagging behind controller input. Many TVs thus have a &quot;game mode&quot; in which minimal processing is done in order to maximize speed at the expense of image quality. Deinterlacing is only partly responsible for such lag; scaling also involves complex algorithms that take milliseconds to run.

==Progressive source material==

Some interlaced video may have been originally created from progressive footage, and the deinterlacing process should consider this as well.

Typical movie material is shot on 24 frames/s film. Converting film to interlaced video typically uses a process called telecine whereby each frame is converted to multiple fields. In some cases, each film frame can be presented by exactly two progressive segmented frames (PsF), and in this format it does not require a complex deinterlacing algorithm because each field contains a part of the very same progressive frame. However, to match 50 field interlaced PAL/SECAM or 59.94/60 field interlaced NTSC signal, frame rate conversion is necessary using various &quot;pulldown&quot; techniques. Most advanced TV sets can restore the original 24 frame/s signal using an inverse telecine process. Another option is to speed up 24-frame film by 4% (to 25 frames/s) for PAL/SECAM conversion; this method is still widely used for DVDs, as well as television broadcasts (SD &amp; HD) in the PAL markets.

DVDs can either encode movies using one of these methods, or store original 24 frame/s progressive video and use MPEG-2 decoder tags to instruct the video player on how to convert them to the interlaced format. Most movies on Blu-rays have preserved the original non interlaced 24 frame/s motion film rate and allow output in the progressive 1080p24 format directly to display devices, with no conversion necessary.

Some 1080i HDV camcorders also offer PsF mode with cinema-like frame rates of 24 or 25 frame/s. TV production crews can also use special film cameras which operate at 25 or 30 frame/s, where such material does not need framerate conversion for broadcasting in the intended video system format.

==Deinterlacing methods==

Deinterlacing requires the display to buffer one or more fields and recombine them into full frames. In theory this would be as simple as capturing one field and combining it with the next field to be received, producing a single frame. However, the originally recorded signal was produced from two fields at different points in time, and without special processing any motion across the fields usually results in a &quot;combing&quot; effect where alternate lines are slightly displaced from each other.

There are various methods to deinterlace video, each producing different problems or artifacts of its own. Some methods are much cleaner in artifacts than other methods.

Most deinterlacing techniques fall under three broad groups:

# Field combination deinterlacing which takes the even and odd fields and combine them into one frame. This halves the perceived frame-rate (the temporal resolution) whereby 50i or 60i is converted to 25p or 30p.
# Field extension deinterlacing which takes each field (with only half the lines) and extend it to the entire screen to make a frame. This halves the vertical resolution of the image but maintains the original field-rate (50i or 60i is converted to 50p or 60p).
# Motion compensation deinterlacing which uses more advanced algorithms to detect motion across fields, switching techniques when necessary. This produces the best quality result, but requires the most processing power.

Modern deinterlacing systems therefore buffer several fields and use techniques like edge detection in an attempt to find the motion between the fields. This is then used to interpolate the missing lines from the original field, reducing the combing effect.

=== Field combination deinterlacing ===

These methods take the even and odd fields and combine them into one frame. They retain the full vertical resolution at the expense of the temporal resolution (perceived frame-rate) whereby 50i/60i is converted to 24p/25p/30p which may lose the smooth, fluid feel of the original. However, if the interlaced signal was originally produced from a lower frame-rate source such as film, then no information is lost and these methods may suffice.

* Weaving is the simplest and most rudimentary method, performed by interleaving (&quot;weaving&quot;) the consecutive fields together into a single frame. This method does not cause any problems when the image has not changed between fields, but any motion will result in artifacts known as &quot;combing&quot; when the pixels in one field do not line up with the pixels in the other, forming a jagged edge.

* Blending is done by &quot;blending&quot;, or &quot;averaging&quot; consecutive fields to be displayed as one frame. Combing is avoided because the images are on top of each other. This instead leaves an artifact known as ghosting. The image loses both vertical resolution and temporal resolution. Although video produced with this technique only requires half the number of pixels vertically, it is often combined with a vertical resize so that the output has no numerical loss in vertical pixels. When interpolation is used, it can result in an even softer image. Blending also loses half the temporal resolution since two motion fields are combined into one frame.
* Selective blending, or &quot;smart blending&quot; or &quot;motion adaptive blending&quot;, is a combination of weaving and blending. As areas that haven&#x27;t changed from frame to frame don&#x27;t need any processing, the frames are woven and only the areas that need it are blended. This retains the full vertical resolution and half the temporal resolution, and it has fewer artifacts than weaving or blending because of the selective combination of both techniques.
* Inverse Telecine: Telecine is used to convert a motion picture source at 24 frames per second to interlaced TV video in countries that use NTSC video system at 30 frames per second. Countries which use PAL at 25 frames per second do not require Telecine – motion picture sources are merely sped up 4% to achieve the needed 25 frames per second. If Telecine was used then it is possible to reverse the algorithm to obtain the original non-interlaced footage, which has a slower frame rate. In order for this to work, the exact telecine pattern must be known or guessed. Unlike most other deinterlacing methods, when it works, inverse telecine can perfectly recover the original progressive video stream.
* Telecine-style algorithms: If the interlaced footage was generated from progressive frames at a slower frame rate (e.g. &quot;cartoon pulldown&quot;), then the exact original frames can be recovered by copying the missing field from a matching previous/next frame. In cases where there is no match (e.g. brief cartoon sequences with an elevated frame rate), then the filter falls back on another deinterlacing method such as blending or line-doubling. This means that the worst case for Telecine is occasional frames with ghosting or reduced resolution. By contrast, when more sophisticated motion-detection algorithms fail, they can introduce pixel artifacts that are unfaithful to the original material. For telecine video, decimation can be applied as a post-process to reduce the frame rate, and this combination is generally more robust than a simple inverse telecine, which fails when differently interlaced footage is spliced together.

=== Field extension deinterlacing ===

These methods take each field (with only half the lines) and extend it to the entire screen to make a frame. This may halve the vertical resolution of the image but aims to maintain the original field-rate (50i or 60i is converted to 50p or 60p).

* Half-sizing displays each interlaced field on its own, resulting in a video with half the vertical resolution of the original, unscaled. While this method retains all original pixels and all temporal resolution it is understandably not used for regular viewing because of its false aspect ratio. However, it can be successfully used to apply video filters which expect a noninterlaced frame, such as those exploiting information from neighbouring pixels (e.g., sharpening).

* Line doubling or &quot;bobbing&quot; takes the lines of each interlaced field (consisting of only even or odd lines) and doubles them, filling the entire frame. This results in the video having a frame rate identical to the original field rate, but each frame having half the vertical resolution, or resolution equal to that of each field that the frame was made from. Line doubling prevents combing artifacts and maintains smooth motion but can cause a noticeable reduction in picture quality from the loss of vertical resolution and visual anomalies whereby stationary objects can appear to bob up and down as the odd and even lines alternate. These techniques are also called &quot;bob deinterlacing&quot; and &quot;linear deinterlacing&quot; for this reason. A variant of this method discards one field out of each frame, halving temporal resolution.

Line doubling is sometimes confused with deinterlacing in general, or with interpolation (image scaling) which uses spatial filtering to generate extra lines and hence reduce the visibility of pixelation on any type of display. The terminology &#x27;line doubler&#x27; is used more frequently in high end consumer electronics, while &#x27;deinterlacing&#x27; is used more frequently in the computer and digital video arena.

=== Motion compensation deinterlacing ===

More advanced deinterlacing algorithms combine the traditional field combination methods (weaving and blending) and frame extension methods (bob or line doubling) to create a high quality progressive video sequence. One of the basic hints to the direction and amount of motion would be the direction and length of combing artifacts in the interlaced signal.

The best algorithms also try to predict the direction and the amount of image motion between subsequent fields in order to better blend the two fields together. They may employ algorithms similar to block motion compensation used in video compression. For example, if two fields had a person&#x27;s face moving to the left, weaving would create combing, and blending would create ghosting. Advanced motion compensation (ideally) would see that the face in several fields is the same image, just moved to a different position, and would try to detect direction and amount of such motion. The algorithm would then try to reconstruct the full detail of the face in both output frames by combining the images together, moving parts of each field along the detected direction by the detected amount of movement. Deinterlacers that use this technique are often superior because they can use information from many fields, as opposed to just one or two, however they require powerful hardware to achieve this in real-time.

Motion compensation needs to be combined with scene change detection (which has its own challenges), otherwise it will attempt to find motion between two completely different scenes. A poorly implemented motion compensation algorithm would interfere with natural motion and could lead to visual artifacts which manifest as &quot;jumping&quot; parts in what should be a stationary or a smoothly moving image.

==Quality Measurement==
Different deinterlacing methods have different quality and speed characteristics.

Usually, to measure quality of deinterlacing method, the following approach is used:
# A set of progressive videos is composed 
# All of these videos are interlaced
# Each of interlaced videos are deinterlaced with specific deinterlacing method
# All of deinterlaced videos are compared with the corresponding source video via objective video quality metric, such as PSNR, SSIM or VMAF.

The main speed measurement metric is frames per second (FPS)—how many frames deinterlacer is able to process per second. Talking about FPS, it is necessary to specify the resolution of all frames and hardware characteristics, because the speed of specific deinterlacing method significantly depends on these two factors.

==Benchmarks==
=== Deinterlacing Challenge 2019 ===
This benchmark has compared 8 different deinterlacing methods on a synthetic video. There is a moving 3-dimensional Lissajous curve on the video in order to make it challenging for the modern deinterlacing methods. The authors used MSE and PSNR as objective metrics. Also, they measure processing speed in FPS. For some methods there is only visual comparison, for others—only objective.

=== MSU Deinterlacer Benchmark ===
This benchmark has compared more than 20 methods on 40 video sequences. Total length of the sequences is 834 frames. Its authors state that the main feature of this benchmark is the comprehensive comparison of methods with visual comparison tools, performance plots and parameter tuning. Authors used PSNR and SSIM as objective metrics.

VapourSynth TDeintMod author states that it is bi-directional motion adaptive deinterlacer. NNEDI method uses a Neural Network to deinterlace video sequences. FFmpeg Bob Weaver Deinterlacing Filter is the part of well-known framework for video and audio processing. Vapoursynth EEDI3 is the abbreviation for &quot;enhanced edge directed interpolation 3&quot;, authors of this method state that it works by finding the best non-decreasing warping between two lines according to a cost functional. The authors of Real-Time Deep Video Deinterlacer use Deep CNN to get the best quality of output video.

==Where deinterlacing is performed==
Deinterlacing of an interlaced video signal can be done at various points in the TV production chain.

===Progressive media===
Deinterlacing is required for interlaced archive programs when the broadcast format or media format is progressive, as in EDTV 576p or HDTV 720p50 broadcasting, or mobile DVB-H broadcasting; there are two ways to achieve this.
*&quot;Production&quot; – The interlaced video material is converted to progressive scan during program production. This should typically yield the best possible quality, since videographers have access to expensive and powerful deinterlacing equipment and software and can deinterlace at the best possible quality, probably manually choosing the optimal deinterlacing method for each frame.
*&quot;Broadcasting&quot; – Real-time deinterlacing hardware converts interlaced programs to progressive scan immediately prior to broadcasting. Since the processing time is constrained by the frame rate and no human input is available, the quality of conversion is most likely inferior to the pre-production method; however, expensive and high-performance deinterlacing equipment may still yield good results when properly tuned.

===Interlaced media===
When the broadcast format or media format is interlaced, real-time deinterlacing should be performed by embedded circuitry in a set-top box, television, external video processor, DVD or DVR player, or TV tuner card. Since consumer electronics equipment is typically far cheaper, has considerably less processing power and uses simpler algorithms compared to professional deinterlacing equipment, the quality of deinterlacing may vary broadly and typical results are often poor even on high-end equipment.

Using a computer for playback and/or processing potentially allows a broader choice of video players and/or editing software not limited to the quality offered by the embedded consumer electronics device, so at least theoretically higher deinterlacing quality is possible – especially if the user can pre-convert interlaced video to progressive scan before playback and advanced and time-consuming deinterlacing algorithms (i.e. employing the &quot;production&quot; method).

However, the quality of both free and commercial consumer-grade software may not be up to the level of professional software and equipment. Also, most users are not trained in video production; this often causes poor results as many people do not know much about deinterlacing and are unaware that the frame rate is half the field rate. Many codecs/players do not even deinterlace by themselves and rely on the graphics card and video acceleration API to do proper deinterlacing.

==Concerns over effectiveness==
The European Broadcasting Union argued against the use of interlaced video in production and broadcasting, recommending 720p 50 fps (frames per second) as then-current production format and working with the industry to introduce 1080p50 as a future-proof production standard until the early 2010s, which offered higher vertical resolution, better quality at lower bitrates, and easier conversion to other formats such as 720p50 and 1080i50. The main argument was that no mattered how complex the deinterlacing algorithm may be, the artifacts in the interlaced signal cannot be eliminated because some information is lost between frames.

Yves Faroudja, the founder of Faroudja Labs and Emmy Award winner for his achievements in deinterlacing technology, stated that &quot;interlace to progressive does not work&quot; and advised against using interlaced signals.

<text>Box of Frogs were an English rock band formed in 1983 by former members of the Yardbirds, who released their first album in 1984. The core group consisted of Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith, and Jim McCarty. Vocals on their eponymous album were done by John Fiddler (formerly of Medicine Head and British Lions). On the second album, Fiddler sang on five songs, with guests singers Graham Parker, Ian Dury and Roger Chapman performing the remaining songs. Many musicians guested on their albums (including guitarists Rory Gallagher, Earl Slick and Steve Hackett, harmonica player Mark Feltham, and keyboardists Max Middleton and Peter-John Vettese). Former Yardbirds bandmates Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page played lead guitar on parts of their first and second albums, respectively.

The group&#x27;s formation and unusual band name were explained on the sticker affixed to original LP releases:
The group showed promise on the first album of rock radio friendly tunes, featuring Jeff Beck. The album was popular on college campuses. Plans were made for a US tour, but it is alleged that Samwell-Smith, Dreja, and McCarty hated the idea of the tour, much to John Fiddler&#x27;s dismay. Jeff Beck, who along with Dzal Martin was considered as the lead guitarist for such a tour, was reportedly disgusted at his ex-bandmates&#x27; refusal to tour America. He took no part on the second album, &quot;Strange Land&quot; (1986), and Fiddler barely chose to do so before walking out. &quot;Asylum&quot; is one of the few songs Fiddler sang on, and was the only one featuring Page.

The group&#x27;s two albums, &quot;Box of Frogs&quot; (1984) and &quot;Strange Land&quot; (1986), were combined for release on a single CD by Renaissance Records in 1996. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, although he commented:

<doc id="615272" wikidata="Q4938331" url="?curid=615272" title="Boiled peanuts">
<text>Boiled peanuts are popular in some places where peanuts are common. Fully mature peanuts do not make good quality boiled peanuts; rather, raw or green ones are used. &quot;Raw&quot; denotes peanuts in a semi-mature state, having achieved full size but not being fully dried, as would be needed for roasting or peanut butter use. &quot;Green&quot; denotes freshly harvested and undried peanuts that must be refrigerated. After boiling in salt water they take on a strong salty taste, becoming softer with prolonged cooking, and somewhat resembling a pea or bean, to which they are related because they are legumes and a nut only in the culinary sense.

The most flavorful peanuts for boiling are the Valencia type. These are preferred in the United States, being grown in gardens and small patches throughout the South. Green Virginia-type peanuts are also sometimes used.

==Regional variations==

===Southern United States===

Boiled peanuts are widely consumed and commercially available in an area of the Southern United States from North Carolina, south to central Florida, as far north as Ohio, and west to Mississippi. The peanuts are sold in the hull and boiled with only salt or with a piquant spice mixture such as Old Bay or Zatarain&#x27;s. The latter are often called &quot;Cajun boiled peanuts&quot; in many recipes.

====History====

Boiling peanuts has been a folk cultural practice in the Southern United States, where they were originally called goober peas, since at least the 19th century. The practice of eating boiled peanuts was likely brought by enslaved black people from West Africa, where the related bambara groundnut is a traditional staple crop. In July and August, when the peanut crops would come in, unsold and surplus peanuts would be prepared in a boiling pot, and extended families and neighbors would gather to share conversation and food. Like a fish fry, peanut boils have been organizing principles for social gatherings. Like okra, fried green tomatoes, black-eyed peas, collard greens and pork barbecue, boiled peanuts are symbols of Southern culture and cuisine.

The first recipe for boiled peanuts was published by Almeda Lambert in 1899. Boiled peanuts became a mainstream commodity in the lower South in the early 20th century. A 1925 account from Orangeburg, South Carolina (where author Andrew F. Smith believes the sale of boiled peanuts may have begun), mentions boys hawking the food as a snack for five cents per bag. The snack was also canned for consumption out of season.

====Preparation====

Raw peanuts and green peanuts are generally used for boiled peanuts. A green peanut is a farm-fresh harvested peanut that has not been dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors and farmers markets during the growing season. &quot;Raw&quot; peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled.
Raw peanuts in the shell are put in a large pot of very heavily salted water and boiled. This can be done inside on a stove, or outside on a propane burner or fire pit for a larger volume. Depending on the locality, some cooks use rock salt or standard table salt, or both. The boil can go on from four to seven hours or more, depending on quantity and the age of the peanut (green peanuts cook faster and tend to be better tasting), and the boilings will most often be of several gallons of water. Flavorings such as ham hocks, hot sauce, Cajun seasonings or beer can be added to the boil. An alternative method for dried raw mature peanuts is to rehydrate them by soaking overnight in water, after which they can be cooked in the conventional manner.

The resulting snack is a very soft peanut in the shell, invariably quite salty. The softened peanuts are easy to open. Often small, immature peanuts (called &quot;pops&quot;) are included; these have even softer shells and can be eaten in their entirety. They tend to absorb more salt than the larger ones. Some aficionados of the dish prefer them cooked for a shorter period of time so that the nut is not as soft.

Boiled peanuts can become slimy or moldy quite quickly without refrigeration. Boiled peanuts can be frozen, then later reheated in a microwave or boiling water for out-of-season consumption. Properly frozen, the flavor is well maintained for even several years.

Boiled peanuts can also be canned and are available commercially.

====Cultural importance====
On May 1, 2006, Governor Mark Sanford signed a bill, H.4585, making boiled peanuts the official snack food of South Carolina.

===Africa===
In Ghana and Nigeria, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food. They are also popular in the KwaZulu Natal region of South Africa, especially in Durban.

Historically, the Bambara groundnut was eaten boiled much like a boiled peanut in much of Africa. Following the introduction of peanuts to Africa in the 16th century, they largely displaced the Bambara groundnut in cuisine.

===Asia===

In China, peanuts are generally boiled with a little salt, sometimes with star anise.

Boiled peanuts in Taiwan are called &quot;tǔdòu&quot; (土豆), although this also refers to peanuts boiled without the hulls such as those in peanut soup (&quot;tǔdòu tang&quot; 土豆湯). Boiled peanuts were traditionally sold in Taiwan by itinerant hawkers (rather than in fixed markets) or prepared in homes by boiling the peanuts in woks. With itinerant hawkers increasingly rare in the country, boiled peanuts in the shell are now seldom consumed.

In Vietnam, boiled peanuts are called &quot;đậu phọng luộc&quot; in the southern part of the country and &quot;lạc luộc&quot; in the northern part of Vietnam. They are often appreciated by eating them at informal gatherings of friends and family while drinking beer poured over ice.

In India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.

===Central and South America===
Boiled peanuts have been eaten for centuries in South America. In Salvador, Bahia, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.

Edward Long, in his 1774 &quot;History of Jamaica&quot;, notes the consumption of boiled peanuts on the island. This practice was likely brought by the enslaved black people from Africa, where Long himself believed peanuts originated.

==Potential health benefits==
The process of boiling peanuts draws antioxidants from their shells. The boiled peanuts have four times the antioxidants of raw or roasted peanuts. Boiled peanuts have also been studied as a potential way to treat people with peanut allergies since boiling peanuts denatures proteins that trigger allergic reactions. In one study, boiled peanuts were given in increasing amounts to four patients over time. Some but not all patients were able to start eating raw peanuts.

<doc id="615277" wikidata="Q7627101" url="?curid=615277" title="Stuart Smalley">
<text>Stuart Smalley is a fictional character created and performed by comedian and satirist Al Franken. The character originated on the television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in a mock self-help show called &quot;Daily Affirmations With Stuart Smalley.&quot; It first aired on the show&#x27;s February 9, 1991 episode hosted by Kevin Bacon. Stuart is Franken&#x27;s middle name. Franken has stated that his &quot;going to Al-Anon meetings inspired [the character] Stuart [Smalley]&quot;. (He attended the meetings in support of his wife, who was battling alcoholism at the time.)

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches==
Stuart participates in many (sometimes fictional) programs, not limited to Overeaters Anonymous, Children of Alcoholic Parents Anonymous, and Children of Rageaholic Parents Anonymous. Within the context of the show, Stuart is quick to point out that he is &quot;not&quot; a licensed therapist but relies instead upon the credibility of his own experiences as a non-professional. His guests are very often celebrities; however, Smalley is seemingly unaware of his guests&#x27; fame as he never uses their full names so as to &quot;protect (their) anonymity.&quot; Other guests who appeared are his family members, such as Macaulay Culkin playing his nephew or Roseanne Barr playing his sister, who suffers from battered wife syndrome. A Canadian relative, Leon Smalley, played by Kiefer Sutherland has a show called &quot;Today&#x27;s Meditation&quot;, which is a big hit in Canada.

==Related works==
The character was popular enough to spawn a 1992 book, &quot;I&#x27;m Good Enough, I&#x27;m Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley&quot;. The book keeps in line with the concept of the character and is presented (tongue-in-cheek) as a legitimate day-to-day affirmation book. Each page is dated and the reader is &quot;supposed&quot; to follow through as if they were actually seeking help. Naturally, however, things go wrong in the writing process, and thus the affirmations branch off into Stuart&#x27;s own commentary about what a hard time he is having writing it, etc. He also discusses his past relationship with ex-significant-other Dale, &quot;the Rageaholic&quot;.

An audiobook was also released, &quot;You&#x27;re Good Enough, You&#x27;re Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like You&quot;. The content of this audio book was completely different from the printed one but followed through on the same gag. The tapes played guided visualizations meant to help the listener relax and focus; however, Stuart makes a vow at the beginning not to make any edits or corrections in the recording process because &quot;I&#x27;m a perfectionist and if I start making changes, I&#x27;ll never stop.&quot; As such it is full of humorous errors, including one gag in which Stuart tells his listeners who are driving to work to &quot;close their eyes and envision...&quot; something. (As such, there is a warning label on the box that says, &quot;Do not listen while driving,&quot; a joke that doesn&#x27;t make sense until one has actually listened to the tape.)

As the character&#x27;s popularity increased, the film &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot; was released. It chronicled the life Stuart leads and his relationship with a very dysfunctional family. His alcoholic father and enabling mother, overweight sister and equally alcoholic brother call upon him when an aunt dies. He is asked to oversee the sale of her home, bringing much-needed money to all of the family. At the same time, his public access self-help show is canceled. Naturally, things go awry, and he must learn to deal with himself and his own life before he can attempt to help others. While many critics praised the film, including Gene Siskel (who awarded the film 3.5 stars out of four, in his print review) and Roger Ebert, the film was financially unsuccessful.

==Later appearances==
The character effectively disappeared after the box-office failure of the film and Franken&#x27;s exit from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, save one appearance where Smalley, bitter over the failure of the movie, refused to finish his affirmation, excoriated his viewers for not watching, and openly wept. At one point in that skit, Smalley (in reference to the film, its glowing reviews, and the film that beat it at the box office) commented: &quot;But you didn&#x27;t want &#x27;funny&#x27; and &#x27;poignant&#x27;. You wanted &#x27;Dumb...and Dumber...and Dumber...and Dumber&#x27;!&quot; In 2004, Franken reprised the Smalley character when Al Gore hosted, mentioning that his father was still an alcoholic.

The character also showed up from time to time on &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot;. Later, after Franken made a bid for a United States Senate seat that ended in success but also in controversy – he would not be officially declared the winner, and therefore under Minnesota law could not be seated, until a full eight months after the election itself – he would be dubbed &quot;Senator Stuart Smalley&quot; by critics and fans alike.

==Catchphrases==

The character is known for a number of catchphrases, many of which are chosen not just for comic effect, but to play on a perceived tendency of the self-help movement to talk and think in psychobabble. Some, such as the phrase &quot;stinkin&#x27; thinkin&#x27;&quot;, are taken from common 12-step slogans.
* &quot;I&#x27;m good enough, I&#x27;m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.&quot;
* &quot;That&#x27;s just stinkin&#x27; thinkin!&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re should-ing all over yourself.&quot;
* &quot;Denial ain&#x27;t just a river in Egypt!&quot;
* &quot;I am a worthy human being.&quot;
* &quot;...and that&#x27;s...okay.&quot;
* &quot;Trace it, face it, and erase it.&quot;
* &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing. They&#x27;re gonna cancel the show. I&#x27;m gonna die homeless and penniless and twenty pounds overweight and no one will ever love me.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m in a shame spiral.&quot;
* &quot;You&#x27;re only as sick as your secrets.&quot;
* &quot;Compare and despair.&quot;
* &quot;You need a checkup from the neckup.&quot;
* &quot;I am a human being, not a human doing.&quot;
* &quot;Pee-wee Herman: There but for the grace of God go I.&quot;
* &quot;It’s easier to put on slippers than to carpet the whole world.&quot;
* &quot;Labels disable.&quot;

<doc id="615278" wikidata="Q1080132" url="?curid=615278" title="Catholic Church in Benin">
<text>The Catholic Church in Benin is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

In 2023, more than half of all Christians in the Republic of Benin are Roman Catholic. 

In 2020, there were an estimated 3.9 million baptised Catholics in Benin, or about 32% of the population, in ten dioceses and archdioceses. There were 1349 priests and 1482 nuns.

==Description and history==
The origin of the Catholic Church in Benin dates back to the effort of Irish and French missionaries of the Society of African Missions (SMA) to plant the seed of Catholicism in West Africa. The first venture by SMA to establish an African Mission in West Africa began in 1858 under the leadership of a Lyon based father, Melchior Joseph de Marion Bresillac. A member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, Bresillac had spent time in India and his desire for the new society was to spread the church and train Africans as priests to continue the work of the mission. The proposal was originally opposed by Pope Pius IX but with Bresillac&#x27;s determination, the propaganda prefect approved the mission. 

When the mission&#x27;s objective was granted in 1856, Dahomey was chosen as location. In November 1858, when the first group of missionaries sailed for West Africa, the location was changed to Sierra Leone as Dahomey was considered too dangerous. The missionaries consisted of two French fathers, Reymond and Bresson and one Brother. The missionaries arrived in January 1859. 

The news of their safe arrival reached Bresillac and in March, Bresillac and two other missionaries sailed for West Africa. Bresillac arrived Freetown in May 1859 but his expedition ended in gloom; Reymond and Bresillac died weeks after his arrival. Bresillac&#x27;s assistant in Lyon, Augustin Planque took his position as Superior General, but unlike Bresillac, Planque stayed in Europe to provide support for the mission and to ensure credibility of the mission in the eyes of the pope. 

A third missionary expedition was approved, the superior of the mission was an Italian priest, Father Francesco Borghero. In 1860, Father Borghero traveled to Africa to start new a mission in Dahomey. The missions&#x27; first location was at Whydah, the second Church was in Porto Novo and in 1868, the third location was Lagos. West Africa was treacherous for the missionaries, one out of four died as a result of malaria or Yellow Fever

In 1870, the name of the Dahomey mission became Apostolic Vicariate of Bight of Benin. The land was severe for the missionaries and the conditions of operations was not helped by the Franco-Prussian War which affected SMA&#x27;s supplies and communication to West Africa. Then in 1883, Dahomey was carved out of the Bight of Benin Vicariate and Lagos became the headquarters of the Vicariate of Bight of Benin.

The mission of Dahomey was separated from Benin in 1883 and made a Prefecture Apostolic, and then in 1901 a Vicariate Apostolic. On 13 May 1948, the name of the Vicariate Apostolic of Dahomey was changed to &quot;Vicariate Apostolic of Ouidah&quot; and the Prefecture Apostolic of Parakou was erected from part of the Prefecture Apostolic of Niamey&#x27;s territory. The elevation of the Vicariate Apostolic of Ouidah soon followed, and it became the Archdiocese of Cotonou in 1955. The Prefecture Apostolic of Parakou was elevated and became the Diocese of Parakou in 1964 and then the Archdiocese of Parakou in 1997.

The Catholic Church in Benin gave one of its most esteemed bishops, Archbishop Bernardin Gantin of Cotonou, to the Roman Curia as Cardinal Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and as Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He worked closely and was a personal friend of both Pope John Paul II, who brought him to Rome, and Benedict XVI, who spoke of him when he visited his tomb in Ouidah, Benin in November 2011, as part of a visit to that country. 

Archbishop Mark Miles was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Benin and Togo in 2021. 

Within Benin the hierarchy consists of:

*Cotonou
**Abomey
**Dassa-Zoumé
**Lokossa
**Porto Novo
*Parakou
**Djougou
**Kandi
**Natitingou
**N&#x27;Dali

<doc id="615279" wikidata="Q60738779" url="?curid=615279" title="Top Ramen">
<text>is an American brand of instant ramen noodles introduced in 1970 by Nissin Foods.

== History ==

Instant noodles were invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-born founder of the Japanese food company Nissin. He used Chicken Ramen as the first brand of instant ramen noodles.

By the late 1960s, Ando desired to enter the US markets, but discovered that most people in the United States did not have ramen-sized bowls or chopsticks. During a business trip to the US, he observed a grocery store manager prepare ramen by placing the block of noodles in a paper cup and pouring boiling water over them, inspiring him to develop the Cup Noodles brand. In 1970, Nissin formed a US subsidiary, and opened their first factory in the US in 1973 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Top Ramen became a major corporate force in the international noodle market which was dominated by Maggi.

==Reputation==
Despite ramen being stereotyped as a &quot;poverty food&quot; which makes up the bulk of a typical US college student&#x27;s diet, Top Ramen was considered an expensive luxury item when it was initially released. In 1958, it sold for , which was comparable to the cost of eating Chinese noodles at a restaurant and several times more than the price of udon noodles at the grocery store. At first many stores were skeptical of Top Ramen&#x27;s potential to succeed and hesitant to stock it, but by end of the year the product was ubiquitous and stores had difficulty keeping pace with the demand.

Food reviewers&#x27; opinions of Top Ramen vary widely, from The Ramen Rater rating the noodles alone 3.25/5 stars and 5/5 stars with some turkey and an egg added, to Douglas Kim, the owner and chef of Jeju Noodle Bar, describing it as tasting &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;very instant&quot; and rating it 1/5 stars. Andy Kryza of &quot;Thrillist&quot; ranked Top Ramen as the fourth best instant noodle brand, particularly appreciating its &quot;overpowering beefy/salty suckerpunch,&quot; although he said that eating it while sober &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem right.&quot; Consumer Reviews criticized Top Ramen&#x27;s &quot;bland broth and too-soft, almost mushy, noodles,&quot; but rated Cup Noodles more favorably, noting that &quot;the food bits are so well done that we can overlook the subpar noodles.&quot;

<doc id="615283" wikidata="Q215786" url="?curid=615283" title="Edward Smith (sea captain)">
<text>Edward John Smith (27 January 1850 – 15 April 1912) was a British sea captain and naval officer. In 1880, he joined the White Star Line as an officer, beginning a long career in the British Merchant Navy. Smith went on to serve as the master of numerous White Star Line vessels. During the Second Boer War, he served in the Royal Naval Reserve, transporting British Imperial troops to the Cape Colony. Smith served as captain of the ocean liner &quot;Titanic&quot;, and went down with the ship when she sank on her maiden voyage.

==Early life==

Edward John Smith was born on 27 January 1850 on Well Street, Hanley, Staffordshire, England to Edward Smith, a potter, and Catherine Hancock, born Marsh, who married on 2 August 1841 in Shelton, Staffordshire. His parents later owned a shop.

Smith attended the British School in Etruria, Staffordshire, until the age of 13 when he left and operated a steam hammer at the Etruria Forge. In 1867, he went to Liverpool at the age of 17 in the footsteps of his half-brother Joseph Hancock, a captain on a sailing ship. He began his apprenticeship on &quot;Senator Weber&quot;, owned by A Gibson &amp; Co. of Liverpool.

On 13 January 1887, Smith married Sarah Eleanor Pennington at St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Winwick, Lancashire. Their daughter, Helen Melville Smith, was born in Waterloo, Liverpool on 2 April 1898. When the White Star line transferred its transatlantic port from Liverpool to Southampton in 1907, the family moved to a red brick, twin-gabled house, named &quot;Woodhead&quot;, on Winn Road, Highfield, Southampton, Hampshire.

==Career==

===Early commands===
Edward Smith joined the White Star Line in March 1880 as the Fourth Officer of . He served aboard the company&#x27;s liners to Australia and to New York City, where he quickly rose in status. In 1887, he received his first White Star command, the . Smith failed his first navigation exam, but on the next attempt in the following week he passed, and in February 1888, Smith earned his Extra Master&#x27;s Certificate. Smith joined the Royal Naval Reserve, receiving a commission as a lieutenant, which entitled him to add the letters &quot;RNR&quot; after his name. This meant that in a time of war, he could be called upon to serve in the Royal Navy. His ships had the distinction of being able to fly the Blue Ensign of the RNR; British merchant vessels generally flew the Red Ensign. Smith retired from the RNR in 1905 with the rank of Commander.

===Later commands===

Smith was &#x27;s captain for nine years commencing in 1895. When the Second Boer War broke out in 1899, &quot;Majestic&quot; was called upon to transport British Imperial troops to the Cape Colony. Smith made two trips to South Africa, both without incident, and in 1903, for his service, King Edward VII awarded him the Transport Medal, showing the &quot;South Africa&quot; clasp. Smith was regarded as a &quot;safe captain&quot;. As he rose in seniority, he gained a following amongst passengers with some sailing the Atlantic only on a ship he captained.

Smith even became known as the &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Captain&quot;. From 1904 on, Smith commanded the White Star Line&#x27;s newest ships on their maiden voyages. In 1904, he was given command of what was then the largest ship in the world, the . Her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York, sailing 29 June 1904, went without incident. After three years with &quot;Baltic&quot;, Smith was given his second new &quot;big ship&quot;, the . Once again, the maiden voyage went without incident. During his command of &quot;Adriatic&quot;, Smith received the long service Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve (RD).

As one of the world&#x27;s most experienced sea captains, Smith was called upon to take first command of the lead ship in a new class of ocean liners, the – again, the largest vessel in the world at that time. The maiden voyage from Southampton to New York was successfully concluded on 21 June 1911, but as the ship was docking in New York harbour, a small incident took place. Docking at Pier 59 under the command of Captain Smith with the assistance of a harbour pilot, &quot;Olympic&quot; was being assisted by twelve tugs when one got caught in the backwash of &quot;Olympic&quot;, spun around, collided with the bigger ship, and for a moment was trapped under &quot;Olympic&#x27;s&quot; stern, finally managing to work free and limp to the docks.

===&quot;Hawke&quot; incident===
On 20 September 1911, &quot;Olympic&quot;″s first major mishap occurred during a collision with a British warship, , in which the warship lost her prow. Although the collision left two of &quot;Olympic&quot;″s compartments filled and one of her propeller shafts twisted, she was able to limp back to Southampton. At the resultant inquiry, the Royal Navy blamed &quot;Olympic&quot;, finding that her massive size generated a suction that pulled &quot;Hawke&quot; into her side. Captain Smith had been on the bridge during the events.

The &quot;Hawke&quot; incident was a financial disaster for White Star, and the out-of-service time for the big liner made matters worse. &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to Belfast and, to speed up the repairs, Harland and Wolff was forced to delay &quot;Titanic&quot;″s completion in order to use one of her propeller shafts and other parts for &quot;Olympic&quot;. Back at sea in February 1912, &quot;Olympic&quot; lost a propeller blade and once again returned for emergency repairs. To get her back to service immediately, Harland and Wolff again had to pull resources from &quot;Titanic&quot;, delaying her maiden voyage from 20 March to 10 April.

==&quot;Titanic&quot;==

Despite the past trouble, Smith was again appointed to command the newest ship in the Olympic class when &quot;Titanic&quot; left Southampton for her maiden voyage. Although some sources state that he had decided to retire after completing &quot;Titanic&quot;″s maiden voyage, an article in the Halifax &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; on 9 April 1912 stated that Smith would remain in charge of &quot;Titanic&quot; &quot;until the Company (White Star Line) completed a larger and finer steamer&quot;.

On 10 April 1912, Smith came aboard &quot;Titanic&quot; at 7 a.m. to prepare for the Board of Trade muster at 8:00 a.m. He immediately went to his cabin to get the sailing report from Chief Officer Henry Wilde. After departure at noon, the huge amount of water displaced by &quot;Titanic&quot; as she passed caused the laid-up &quot;New York&quot; to break from her moorings and swing towards &quot;Titanic.&quot; Quick action from Smith helped to avert a premature end to the maiden voyage.
The first four days of the voyage passed without incident, but on 14 April 1912, &quot;Titanic&quot;″s radio operators received six messages from other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on &quot;Titanic&quot; had begun to notice during the afternoon.

Although the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they did not reduce the ship&#x27;s speed and continued to steam at . &quot;Titanic&quot;″s high speed in waters where ice had been reported was later criticised as reckless, but it reflected standard maritime practice at the time. According to Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the custom was &quot;to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the crow&#x27;s nest and the watch on the bridge to &#x27;pick up&#x27; the ice in time to avoid hitting it&quot;. Lowe, who was crossing the Atlantic for the first time in his life, admitted under examination that he had never heard that icebergs were common off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and said that the fact would not have interested him if he had. He did not know that the &quot;Titanic&quot; was following what was called &quot;the southern track&quot;, and made a guess that the ship was on the northern one.

The North Atlantic liners prioritised time-keeping above all other considerations, sticking rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee arrival at an advertised time. They were frequently driven at close to their full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; close calls were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, , a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but was still able to complete her voyage. That same year Smith declared in an interview that he could not &quot;imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.&quot;

Shortly after 11:40 p.m. on 14 April, Smith was informed by First Officer William Murdoch that the ship had just collided with an iceberg. It was soon apparent that the ship was seriously damaged; designer Thomas Andrews reported that all of the first five of the ship&#x27;s compartments had been breached and that &quot;Titanic&quot; would sink in under two hours.

There are conflicting reports about Smith&#x27;s actions during the evacuation. Some say that he did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club said, &quot;He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats&quot;. Robert Williams Daniel, a first-class passenger, said: &quot;Captain Smith was the biggest hero I ever saw. He stood on the bridge and shouted through a megaphone, trying to make himself heard.&quot;

Other sources say that he was very ineffective and inactive in preventing loss of life. Captain Smith was an experienced seaman who had served for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first crisis of his career, and he would have known that even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down, with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.

Just minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing &quot;Titanic&quot; crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators&#x27; room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John &quot;Jack&quot; Phillips from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: &quot;Now it&#x27;s every man for himself.&quot; At 2:10 a.m., Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say, &quot;Well, boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.&quot; He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone. This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. A few minutes later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty. Five minutes later, the ship disappeared beneath the ocean. Smith perished that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered.

===Death===

There are conflicting accounts of Smith&#x27;s death. Some survivors said they saw Smith enter the ship&#x27;s wheelhouse on the bridge, and die there when it was engulfed. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; in its 19 April 1912 edition quoted Robert Williams Daniel, who jumped from the stern immediately before the ship sank, &quot;I saw Captain Smith on the bridge. My eyes seemingly clung to him. The deck from which I had leapt was immersed. The water had risen slowly and was now to the floor of the bridge. Then it was to Captain Smith&#x27;s waist. I saw him no more. He died a hero.&quot;

Captain Smith himself made statements hinting that he would go down with his ship if he was ever confronted with a disaster. A friend of Smith&#x27;s, Dr. Williams, asked Captain Smith what would happen if the &quot;Adriatic&quot; struck a concealed reef of ice and was badly damaged. &quot;Some of us would go to the bottom with the ship,&quot; was Smith&#x27;s reply. A boyhood friend, William Jones said, &quot;Ted Smith passed away just as he would have loved to do. To stand on the bridge of his vessel and go down with her was characteristic of all his actions when we were boys together.&quot; Because of these factors, as well as accounts of Smith going inside the wheelhouse, this has remained the iconic image of Smith, perpetuated by film portrayals.

When working to free Collapsible B, Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride said he saw Captain Smith dive from the bridge into the sea just as Collapsible B was levered off the roof of the officers&#x27; quarters, a story corroborated by first class passenger Mrs Eleanor Widener, who was in Lifeboat No. 4 (the closest to the sinking ship) at the time. Also second class passenger William John Mellors, who survived aboard Collapsible B, stated that Smith jumped from the bridge.
 One writer states that witness and survivor Harold Bride &quot;could here be mistaking Captain Smith for Lightoller, who we know did exactly this at this time, first swimming towards the crow&#x27;s nest.&quot;

Several accounts say that Smith may have been seen in the water near the overturned Collapsible B during or after the sinking. Colonel Archibald Gracie reported that an unknown swimmer came near the capsized and overcrowded lifeboat and that one of the men on board told him &quot;Hold on to what you have, old boy. One more of you aboard would sink us all&quot;; in a powerful voice, the swimmer replied &quot;All right boys. Good luck and God bless you.&quot;. Gracie did not see this man, nor was able to identify him, but some other survivors later claimed to have recognised this man as Smith. Another man (or possibly the same) never asked to come aboard the boat, but instead cheered its occupants saying &quot;Good boys! Good lads!&quot; with &quot;the voice of authority&quot;.

One of the Collapsible B survivors, fireman Walter Hurst, tried to reach him with an oar, but the rapidly rising swell carried the man away before he could reach him. Hurst said he was certain this man was Smith. Some of these accounts also describe Smith carrying a child to the boat. Harry Senior, one of &quot;Titanic&quot;″s stokers, and second class passenger Charles Eugene Williams, who both survived aboard Collapsible B, stated that Smith swam with a child in his arms to Collapsible B, which Smith presented to a steward, after which he apparently swam back to the rapidly foundering ship. Williams&#x27; account differs slightly, claiming that, after Smith handed the child over to the steward, he asked what had become of First Officer Murdoch.

Upon hearing news of Murdoch&#x27;s demise, Smith &quot;pushed himself away from the lifeboat, threw his lifebelt from him and slowly sank from our sight. He did not come to the surface again.&quot; These accounts are almost certainly apocryphal, according to historians featured in the A&amp;E Documentary &quot;&quot;. Lightoller, who survived on Collapsible B, never reported seeing Smith in the water or receiving a child from him. There is also no way survivors on Collapsible B would have been able to verify an individual&#x27;s identity under such dimly lit and chaotic circumstances. It is more likely based on wishful thinking that the person they saw was the Captain. Captain Smith&#x27;s fate will probably remain uncertain.

For many years, there were also conflicting accounts of Smith&#x27;s last words. Newspaper reports said that as the final plunge began, Smith advised those on board to &quot;Be British, boys. Be British!&quot; Although this is engraved on his memorial and portrayed in the 1996 TV miniseries, it is a popular myth. If Smith had said these words to anyone, it would have been to the crew, but not one of the surviving crew members claimed he did. Because Steward Brown&#x27;s account of Smith giving orders before walking onto the bridge was the last reliable sighting, this would make Smith&#x27;s last words simply: &quot;Well, boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.&quot;

==Legacy==

A statue of Smith, sculpted by Kathleen Scott, widow of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott, was unveiled in July 1914 at the western end of the Museum Gardens in Beacon Park, Lichfield. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite and the figure is bronze. Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. The statue originally cost £740 (£ with inflation) raised through local and national contributions.

In 2010, as part of the &quot;Parks for People&quot; programme, the statue was restored and the green patina removed from its surface at a cost of £16,000. In 2011 an unsuccessful campaign was started to get the statue moved to Captain Smith&#x27;s home town of Hanley.

Smith had already been commemorated in Hanley Town Hall with a plaque reading: &quot;This tablet is dedicated to the memory of Commander Edward John Smith RD, RNR. Born in Hanley, 27th Jany 1850, died at sea, 15th April 1912. Whilst in command of the White Star SS &quot;Titanic&quot; that great ship struck an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean during the night and speedily sank with nearly all who were on board. Captain Smith having done all man could do for the safety of passengers and crew remained at his post on the sinking ship until the end. His last message to the crew was &#x27;Be British.&#x27;&quot;

The plaque was removed in 1961, given to a local school and then returned to the Town Hall but remounted in the interior of the building in 1978. The Titanic Brewery in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, is in honour of him.

As a member of the Royal Naval Reserve, Smith wore his two decorations when in uniform: the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve and the Transport Medal.

==Family==
Smith&#x27;s mother, Catherine Hancock, lived in Runcorn, Cheshire, where Smith himself intended to retire. She died there in 1893. Smith&#x27;s half-sister Thyrza died in 1921 and his widow, Sarah Eleanor Smith, was hit and killed by a taxi in London in 1931. Their daughter, Helen Melville, married and gave birth to twins in 1923, Simon and Priscilla. Simon, a pilot in the Royal Air Force, was killed in 1944, during World War II. Priscilla died from polio three years later; neither of them had children. Helen died in 1973.

<doc id="615297" wikidata="Q8059316" url="?curid=615297" title="Protestant youth ministry">
<text>A Protestant or Evangelical youth ministry is a Christian ministry aimed towards young people through the lens of Protestant or Evangelical traditions. Focuses may include the instruction of youths in what it means to be a Christian, how to mature as a Christian, and how to evangelize others through apologetics. Youth ministries may vary widely depending on their denomination, size, liberal or conservative outlook and geographic location.

The doctrine of Sunday Sabbatarianism held by many Christian denominations encourages practices such as Sunday School attendance as it teaches that the entirety of the Lord&#x27;s Day should be devoted to God; as such many children and teenagers often return to church in the late afternoon for youth group before attending an evening service of worship.

Youth ministry in the United States began in the mid-19th century, in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. These changes resulted in young men moving into central urban areas to work in factories. Laypersons who noticed these young adults working six days a week and gallivanting about town on Sundays aspired to educate them. Early youth ministry focused on teaching older children and teenagers to read the Bible. Early ministry was designed for unchurched children with no formal education. A desirable secondary effect was that students would be inspired to become more devoted to their faith through the reading of Biblical passages. 

Eventually, churches opened up Sunday school to church members and unchurched children and teens alike. Teachers encouraged students to bring their friends, and the movement gained momentum. Laypersons would often work independently, neither subjecting themselves to congregational scrutiny nor receiving church funding. This fostered the development of interdenominational teaching programs and, eventually, faith-based organizations devoted to youth such as the YMCA and YWCA, whose American branches were founded in the 1850s.

American clergyman Francis Edward Clark founded the Christian Endeavor Society in 1881, which further popularized youth ministry. Clark set the limit for each society at 80 members. By 1887, there were 700 societies with over 50,000 members spread out across 33 states.

In response to the rapid expansion of the Christian Endeavor Society, mainstream denominations began their own youth organizations modeled after it. Some examples are the Methodist church’s Epworth League, and the Lutheran church&#x27;s Luther League. These new church-based organizations, as well as interdenominational ones already in existence, flourished, increasing in attendance and international outreach involvement as a part of faith-based foreign aid.

==== 20th century ====
After World War I, the focus of many youth ministries began to shift from outreach and conversion to education and understanding of faith. From the 1930s to the 1960s, many churches emphasized fellowship and theological understanding.

Before 1940, youth fellowships were primarily headed by the congregation&#x27;s pastor. Beginning in the late 1940s, some churches introduced church youth committees, composed of youth who had recently returned from war.

The 1940s also saw the founding of parachurch ministries. Young Life was founded by Jim Rayburn in 1941. The Young Life Parachurch Model proved to be effective at reaching young people, and by the early 1950&#x27;, Parachurch Youth Ministries with full-time staff flourished. Billy Graham was the first full-time parachurch worker for Youth for Christ (YfC) in the USA. This movement spread quickly around the world. During the 1950s, parachurch ministries grew rapidly in most Christianized countries, and the focus of activity was on large events, known as rallies, and stadium events, known as Crusades. The emphasis was on promoting inter-church activities (between local denominational churches) – mainly in the format of youth rallies – the type of stadium events made popular by Youth for Christ.

The 1960s were characterized by campus ministries. Many college-aged students did not have their theological needs met by these fellowship groups; soon thereafter, even younger adolescents began to see their organizations as institutionalized and irrelevant. Denominations stopped publishing youth group (Sunday School) resources and large group gatherings dwindled down into small meetings and then into nothing. Then specific church-based activities for youth emerged, as Friday night youth groups began.

During the 1970s, many denominations implemented strategies for modernizing existing youth ministry in the hopes of reviving it. Differences in youth ministry started to emerge on a denominational basis instead of organization to organization.

During the early 1980s, counselling became more widespread in church environments, and churches began to hire professional counsellors. This influenced youth groups and the Bible study meetings became &quot;fellowship groups&quot; or &quot;home groups&quot; with an emphasis on caring and meeting people.

More recently, despite Francis Edward Clark&#x27;s original intent for youth ministry to raise young adults “responsible for larger service in the Church of Christ,” studies indicate significant numbers of young people are not transitioning into the Adult Church from Youth Ministry after graduation from high school. As a result, more churches are scrutinizing their traditional Youth Ministry programming and working to engage parents and the Adult Church more fully with the young people and involve young people more deeply in the work of the church.

==Organization in the United States==
Youth ministry today is a large part of American Christian culture. In New York City alone there are over 3,500 youth organizations operating today. Despite denominational difference, there are basic practices and goals that most youth groups have in common.

===Organization===
Most youth groups tend to follow a similar organizational model. The church that supports them will allocate funds to use for the activities of the group. It also will employ a paid staff member or volunteer to lead the group, known as a youth pastor, youth minister, Pastor of Student Ministries, Youth Leader, or other similar terms. This person may be a layperson, hold a religious degree, or be a member of the ordained clergy, depending on the needs and resources of the church. Their duties may include orchestrating the activities of the group (in particular, the content of the regular meetings below), providing pastoral care for the members of the youth group, managing a budget for the youth group, and serving as a liaison between the youth and adult bodies of the congregation.

Today&#x27;s youth ministries hold regular meetings, often at the same time as adult functions at the church. Youth group meetings generally feature the same types of activities as a Sunday morning church service; modified to reflect the culture of the age groups involved. Services may include a time for worship, drama, games or other activities as well as fellowship through conversation and/or food, and prayer. Many youth ministers also present a sermon or devotional. It&#x27;s common for youth groups to attend Christian summer camps each year.

Most denominations arrange their Youth Ministry programs according to related educational levels. American churches tend to separate youth by grade level, creating smaller sub-groups within a youth ministry program. These distinctions usually fall between middle school and high school. Traditionally, elementary age children and below have separate programs altogether, though this, too, may be managed by the same youth pastor. Some youth groups even extend up through college students, creating an additional sub-group often referred to as &quot;college and career&quot;.

=== Goals ===
The primary goal of most modern-day Youth Ministries is to teach youth biblical doctrines and to encourage them to regularly pray. This is different from the original education/literacy-centered programs of Sunday schools during the 19th century.

Prior to the 21st century, many denominations placed less emphasis on the role of youth in the church.

Youth groups often teach topics related to Christian apologetics, drawing from books by Christian thinkers such as John Lennox, C. S. Lewis, John Polkinghorne, Francis Collins and William Lane Craig.

<doc id="615301" wikidata="Q1044568" url="?curid=615301" title="Caroline Springs, Victoria">
<text>Caroline Springs is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Melton local government area. Caroline Springs recorded a population of 20,365 at the 2021 census.

Caroline Springs has been developed on greenfield land since 1999 by Delfin, in partnership with the original landowners. Centrally located, just north of Kororoit Creek, is the town square and main shopping centre, known as CS Square, and a man-made lake known as &quot;Lake Caroline&quot;.

At the time of development, it was one of Melbourne&#x27;s fastest growing suburbs and Delfin anticipated the population to be in excess of 25,000 people by 2015.

The Caroline Springs Post Office opened on 8 August 2005.

==Developments==

A$40 million five-star hotel owned by the Mercure Hotels group opened in August 2009. A new hotel and entertainment complex named WestWaters on the edge of Lake Caroline is now open.

On 4 April 2019, construction on the extension of CS Square was officially opened. The expansion made way for a new Woolworths supermarket, multiple new retail stores and an expanded car park.

==Flora and fauna==


Kororoit Creek runs through the centre of the suburb. The creek has been home to healthy populations of native animals for thousands of years, including the tiger snake, the eastern blue-tongued lizard, the common snakeneck turtle, the eastern brown snake and kangaroos. Due to development over the past 15 years, these species are now rarely seen in the area.

Due to development of large lakes and wetlands, species of frogs have reclaimed the area. The common eastern froglet, the eastern banjo frog and even the now endangered growling grass frog have been seen and heard in the new lakes, wetlands and in Kororoit Creek. Many species of birds are also returning to the creeks and lakes. There are also a few kangaroos, several located in the endangered grassland bordered by Holland Way and College Street. These can usually be seen from the steel board walk or 4m viewing platform.

It is expected that the Kororoit Creek Trail will eventually be linked up to Caroline Springs providing cyclists with an off-road path all the way to Sunshine and onto the Melbourne central business district.

==Transport==

The suburb&#x27;s main form of transport is the car and is a largely car-dependent community. It was planned under the concepts of street hierarchy and has just one main arterial, Caroline Springs Boulevard, which feeds into both the Deer Park Bypass and the Western Highway in the south and connects to Melbourne via either the Western Ring Road or the Princes Highway.

Caroline Springs railway station was one of a number of new train stations proposed under the 2008 Victorian Transport Plan. The station opened in January 2017.

==Sport==

Caroline Springs is currently represented in a number of local and regional sports.

Caroline Springs Hockey Club is one of the newest members in the local sports community. Founded in 2016, &quot;The Springers&quot; compete in the Hockey Victoria Pennant and Metro competitions.

<text>Diggers Rest (formerly Diggers&#x27; Rest) is a suburb in Victoria, Australia. It is and 29 minutes north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Hume and Melton local government areas. Diggers Rest recorded a population of 5,669 at the 2021 census.

Diggers Rest lies on the Old Calder Highway, near the Calder Freeway.

==History==
Diggers Rest began life as a stopping place on the road to the Bendigo goldfields, with the Post Office opening on 18 June 1860. Caroline Chisholm started a women&#x27;s shelter in the area. The town grew in the 1870s and 1880s and became a postal village with a general store, post office, weighbridge, mechanics&#x27; institute and a chaff mill. The Diggers Rest Hotel was built by 1854, and later enlarged, and became an important stopping place on the route to the goldfields. It was severely damaged by fire.

Diggers Rest is referred to as being famous for the first controlled powered flight of an aeroplane undertaken in Australia. The flight was performed by Harry Houdini on the 18th of March, 1910. The only café in town is named in his honour.

To the north of Diggers Rest township within the locality is the former township known as Aitken&#x27;s Gap, The Gap or Buttlejorrk.

==Sunbury Rock Festival==

The four Sunbury Pop Festivals were held on the same 620-acre (2.5 km2) private farm along Jacksons Creek, on the southern outskirts of Sunbury, between Sunbury and Diggers Rest. The property was owned by farmer and local identity George Duncan, and the property has become known in the district over the years simply as &quot;Duncan&#x27;s farm&quot;. The entrance gates to the Sunbury Pop Festivals were off Watsons Road. Also because of its proximity (2 km; 1.2 mi) to the smaller township of Diggers Rest, many of the attendees who traveled to Sunbury by train, actually alighted at Diggers Rest railway station, and not Sunbury.

==Present day==
Diggers Rest contains a general store, a primary school and a CFA fire station, along with three large recreation reserves. Sporting groups in Diggers Rest include Diggers Rest Football Club, which play in the Riddell District Football League.

Diggers Rest Primary School was first opened in 1882 and moved to its present site in 1990. Diggers Rest Primary School features excellent facilities including air conditioned and heated classrooms, computer and Internet access to all grades, modern sports and playground equipment and landscaped grounds. Diggers Rest Primary School is an integral part of the wider community and hosts annual events such as the Community Carols, Billy Cart Derby and Grandparents&#x27; Day.

Other facilities in the Diggers Rest area include the Holden Flora and Fauna Reserve, Animal Land Children&#x27;s Farm and SPSK Jadran, and a Slovenian social club which services nearby St Albans and Keilor.

Diggers Rest also has a Scout Group containing Cub Scouts and Scouts. They meet at the Diggers Rest Reserve behind the tennis club rooms.

==Transport==

Diggers Rest has a railway station on the Sunbury line, connecting the town with Melbourne&#x27;s CBD.

A bus route connects Diggers Rest with Moonee Ponds and nearby Sunbury, at the former Victoria University campus.

<doc id="615307" wikidata="Q297442" url="?curid=615307" title="Kate Smith">
<text>Kathryn Elizabeth Smith (May 1, 1907 – June 17, 1986) was an American contralto. Referred to as The First Lady of Radio, Smith is well known for her renditions of &quot;God Bless America&quot; and &quot;When the Moon Comes over the Mountain&quot;. She became known as The Songbird of the South because of her tremendous popularity during World War II.

==Early life==
Smith was born on May 1, 1907, in Greenville, Virginia, to Charlotte &#x27;Lottie&#x27; Yarnell (&quot;née&quot; Hanby) and William Herman Smith and grew up in Washington, D.C. Her father owned the Capitol News Company, distributing newspapers and magazines in the greater D.C. area. She was the youngest of three daughters, the middle child dying in infancy. She failed to talk until she was four years old, but a year later she was singing at church social events. By the time she was eight, she was singing for the troops at Army camps in the Washington area during World War I. Smith never had a singing lesson in her life and possessed a &#x27;rich range&#x27; of two and a half octaves. Her earliest performances were during amateur nights at vaudeville theaters in D.C.

Her earliest musical influences were her parents: her father sang in the choir at the Catholic church; her mother played piano at the Presbyterian church. She attended Business High School in D.C. (now Theodore Roosevelt High School), likely graduating in 1924. Alarmed by his daughter&#x27;s evident penchant for the stage, her father sent her to the George Washington University School for Nursing where she attended classes for nine months between 1924 and 1925, withdrawing to pursue a career in show business.

She got herself on the bill at Keith&#x27;s Theater in Boston as a singer. Heading the bill was the actor and producer Eddie Dowling, who recruited the young singer for a revue he was preparing. It was called &quot;Honeymoon Lane&quot;, and opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey on August 29, 1926. A month later, it moved to Broadway.

An indelicate review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on October 31, 1926, under the heading &quot;A Sophie Tucker Rival&quot;, said: &quot;A 19-year-old girl, weighing in the immediate neighborhood of 200 pounds, is one of the discoveries of the season for those whose interests run to syncopators and singers of what in the varieties and nightclubs are known as &#x27;hot&#x27; songs. Kate Smith is the newcomer&#x27;s not uncommon name.&quot;

When &quot;Honeymoon Lane&quot; closed, Smith had difficulty finding work in New York, so she returned to Washington, D.C. where she appeared sporadically in vaudeville. Smith joined the road company of Vincent Youmans&#x27; &quot;Hit the Deck&quot;, where she won acclaim singing &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; as a mammy in blackface. Back in New York City, she took the company lead in George White&#x27;s &quot;Flying High&quot;, which opened at the whites only Hurtig &amp; Seamon&#x27;s New Burlesque Theater (which later became the Apollo Theater) on March 3, 1930, and ran for 122 performances. As Pansy Sparks, Smith&#x27;s role was to be the butt of Bert Lahr&#x27;s often cruel jibes about her girth. She said later that she often wept with humiliation in her dressing room after the show.

==Career==

During &quot;Honeymoon Lane&quot;″s run in New York, Smith made her first phonograph recordings, consisting of songs from that show. The first sessions were for Victor but none were issued. Her first issued recordings, from an October 28, 1926, session, appeared on the Columbia label. She made a few more records for Columbia through May 1927. In 1929 through 1931 she again returned to Columbia&#x27;s studios, this time appearing for the budget labels Harmony, Diva and Velvet Tone under a pseudonym. These commercially successful records were often sung in the style of Ethel Waters and Ruth Etting, although others were more akin to the early crooning style of Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo.

Her musical career took a huge leap in 1930 when Columbia Records A&amp;R executive Ted Collins took an interest as a result of her &quot;Hit the Deck&quot; performances. Collins would become her longtime manager in 50–50 partnership. Smith had become self-conscious regarding her weight, in no small part because of the on- and off-stage mocking she received from co-star Bert Lahr. She later credited Collins with helping her overcome her self-consciousness, writing, &quot;Ted Collins was the first man who regarded me as a singer, and didn&#x27;t even seem to notice that I was a big girl.&quot; She noted, &quot;I&#x27;m big, and I sing, and boy, when I sing, I sing all over!&quot;

Collins put Smith on radio in 1931. That year, she performed &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot;. Her biggest hits were &quot;River, Stay &#x27;Way from My Door&quot; (1931), &quot;The Woodpecker Song&quot; (1940), &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1942), &quot;Rose O&#x27;Day&quot; (1941), &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (1940), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Walk Without You&quot; (1942), &quot;There Goes That Song Again&quot; (1944), &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot; (1946), and &quot;Now Is the Hour&quot; (1947). &quot;Rose O&#x27;Day&quot; sold over one million copies, her first to achieve this feat, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Her theme song was &quot;When the Moon Comes over the Mountain&quot;; she had helped write the lyrics. Smith greeted her audience with &quot;Hello, everybody!&quot; and signed off with &quot;Thanks for listenin&#x27;.&quot;

In 1932, Smith appeared in &quot;Hello, Everybody!&quot;, with co-stars Randolph Scott and Sally Blane, and in the 1943 wartime film &quot;This Is the Army&quot;, she sang &quot;God Bless America&quot;, which became her signature song.

===Radio===

Smith was a major star of radio, usually backed by Jack Miller&#x27;s Orchestra. She began with her twice-a-week NBC series, &quot;Kate Smith Sings&quot; (quickly expanded to six shows a week), followed by a series of shows for CBS: &quot;Kate Smith and Her Swanee Music&quot; (1931–33), sponsored by La Palina Cigars; &quot;The Kate Smith Matinee&quot; (1934–35); &quot;The Kate Smith New Star Revue&quot; (1934–35); &quot;Kate Smith&#x27;s Coffee Time&quot; (1935–36), sponsored by A&amp;P; and &quot;The Kate Smith A&amp;P Bandwagon&quot; (1936–37).

&quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; was a leading radio variety show, offering comedy, music, and drama with appearances by top personalities of films and theater for eight years (1937–1945). The show&#x27;s resident comics, Abbott and Costello and Henny Youngman, introduced their comedy to a nationwide radio audience aboard her show, while a series of sketches based on the Broadway production of the same name led to &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot; as a separate hit series in 1940.

Smith also made a dramatic appearance, starring in &quot;Little Johnny Appleseed&quot; on &quot;Silver Theater&quot; on May 14, 1944. By 1946, she also collaborated with the actor Pat O&#x27;Brien on the &quot;Viva America&quot; program for the CBS radio network in support of America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives in South America. 

Smith&#x27;s figure was not the only target of satire. Her cheery radio sign-on was parodied by comedian Henry Morgan when he launched his own show in 1942: &quot;Good evening, anybody, here&#x27;s Morgan,&quot; which became his sign-on. Morgan recalled in his memoir &quot;Here&#x27;s Morgan&quot;, that Smith&#x27;s sign-on struck him as condescending: &quot;I, on the other hand, was grateful if anybody was listening.&quot;

Smith continued on the Mutual Broadcasting System, CBS, ABC, and NBC, presenting both music and talk shows on radio until 1960.

===World War II===
Smith &quot;stirred patriotic fervor&quot; during World War II and contributed to the sale of over $600 million (equivalent to $ in ) of war bonds during a series of marathon broadcasts. No other show-business star came near her as revenue producer of War Bonds to finance the United States&#x27; war effort.

In 1944, Smith launched a campaign against the film Double Indemnity. James M. Cain recalled that &quot;there was a little trouble caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people to stay away from the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross.&quot;

===Television===

Smith starred in two concurrent television programs in the early 1950s &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; on NBC Television from 1950 through 1954, hosting until 1953 in the late afternoon hour of 4:00 pm ET. James Dean and Audrey Hepburn made early acting appearances on the show. Smith also starred in the weekly &quot;The Kate Smith Evening Hour&quot; which included a rare US TV appearance by Josephine Baker as well as the only major filmed footage of Hank Williams. Smith continued on the Mutual Broadcasting System, CBS, ABC, and NBC, presenting both music and talk shows on radio until 1960.

From January 25 to July 18, 1960, Smith hosted &quot;The Kate Smith Show&quot;, a variety program on the CBS Television Monday evening schedule. On October 2, 1966, Smith performed on the British television show, &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;.

Because of her popularity, her face was a common sight in print advertisements of the day. Over the years, she acted as a commercial spokeswoman for numerous companies such as Studebaker, Pullman, Diamond Crystal Salt, and Jell-O.

==Recordings==
Smith recorded dozens of successful albums and songs during the 1930s and 1940s. She recorded sporadically during the 1950s, but in 1963 signed a contract with RCA Victor to record a number of successful albums, including several that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200 chart alongside the major rock stars of the era, usually with Smith, then well into her fifties, the oldest performer on the charts. In 1967, she had her first new hit record in many years when &quot;Anyone Can Move A Mountain&quot; peaked at #30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening Hits chart in July 1967. This record was her only 1960s single release to be successful. In 1974, Smith returned to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening chart when &quot;Smile, Smile, Smile&quot;, a one-shot single release (and her last recording) for Atlantic Records, peaked at #42 in June 1974.

==Significance in professional sports==
The Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team played Smith&#x27;s rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; before their game on December 11, 1969. The Flyers&#x27; public address announcer had noticed that people would not pay attention or would show disdain for the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; played before games, due to the tensions caused by the Vietnam War, and he decided to use Smith&#x27;s rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; instead. The crowd responded more favorably to this recording. After the Flyers won the game, it was decided by the team that the song would be used as an alternative to the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, but only for certain important games.

At the Flyers&#x27; home opener against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 11, 1973, Smith made a surprise appearance to perform the song in person and received a tremendous reception. The Flyers won that game by a 2–0 score. She again performed the song at the Spectrum in front of a capacity crowd of 17,007 fans before game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals on May 19, 1974, against the Boston Bruins. Before this game, Smith had a &quot;Flyer Record&quot; of 36–3–1 (win-loss-tie). After her performance, in keeping with the Flyers&#x27; reputation of &quot;The Broad Street Bullies&quot;, Smith mimicked a knockout punch. Boston&#x27;s defenseman Bobby Orr and center Phil Esposito tried to jinx the Flyers&#x27; &quot;good luck charm&quot; by shaking her hand after her performance. Yet, the Flyers won their first of two back-to-back Stanley Cups, winning that playoff series against the Boston Bruins four games to two, with goaltender Bernie Parent shutting the Bruins out 1–0 in the game.

Smith also performed live at the Flyers&#x27; home game on May 13, 1975, before Game 7 of the Stanley Cup semifinals against the Islanders. After her performance, Islanders&#x27; captain Ed Westfall presented her with a bouquet of flowers as each member of the Islanders lined up to shake her hand. Nonetheless, the Flyers won the game 4–1. On May 16, 1976, Smith made one of her final public performances before Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals when the Flyers lost to the Montreal Canadiens 5–3 and were swept in that series. She made her final public performance on May 23, 1985, before Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals when the Flyers lost to the Edmonton Oilers 3–1, and lost the series in five games.

The Flyers&#x27; record when &quot;God Bless America&quot; was played or sung by Smith in person stood at 100 wins, 29 losses, and five ties . Smith and her song remain a special part of Flyers&#x27; history. In 1987, the team erected a statue of Smith outside the Spectrum, their arena at the time, in her memory. However, the statue was later covered and then removed in April 2019 due to criticism of lyrics in some of her earlier songs that were perceived as racist. Until that time, the Flyers still showed a video of her singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; in lieu of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for good luck before important games. The video of Smith&#x27;s performance was later accompanied by Lauren Hart, daughter of the late Hockey Hall of Fame broadcaster, Gene Hart, longtime voice of the Flyers, and anthem singer for the Flyers. Before games whenever &quot;God Bless America&quot; was performed, Lou Nolan, the public address announcer for the Flyers at Wells Fargo Center would say &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we ask that you please rise and remove your hats and salute our flags and welcome the number-one ranked anthemist in the NHL, Lauren Hart, as she sings &#x27;God Bless America&#x27;, accompanied by the great Kate Smith.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s plump figure made her an occasional object of derision; however, late in her career, Philadelphia Flyers hockey fans said about her appearance before games &quot;It ain&#x27;t BEGUN &#x27;til the fat lady sings!&quot; Smith was tall and weighed at the age of 30. She titled her 1938 autobiography &quot;Living in a Great Big Way&quot;.

Smith was the grand marshal of the 1976 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California and sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; and the National Anthem before the Rose Bowl game, a UCLA victory over Ohio State.

===21st-century controversy ===
Smith&#x27;s rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; was played during the seventh-inning stretch of New York Yankees home games from 2001 until April 2019, when the practice was discontinued amid controversy surrounding her 1931 recordings of &quot;That&#x27;s Why Darkies Were Born&quot; and &quot;Pickaninny Heaven&quot;. The following day, the Philadelphia Flyers followed suit, and the statue of Smith outside the Flyers&#x27; arena was removed on April 21, 2019. Her family responded by denying the racism allegations. Those against the discontinuation of Smith&#x27;s recordings have cited the satirical nature of the song &quot;That&#x27;s Why Darkies Were Born&quot;, and the fact that it was also popularized by Paul Robeson. The song &quot;Pickaninny Heaven&quot; is from the movie &quot;Hello, Everybody!&quot;, one of whose writers was Fannie Hurst, an advocate for African American equality.

Smith called for racial tolerance in 1945 in an address on CBS Radio, declaring, &quot;Race hatreds, social prejudices, religious bigotry, they are the diseases that eat away the fibers of peace&quot;. She went on to state &quot;it is up to us to tolerate one another in order to achieve peace&quot;.

==Personal life==
Smith, who never married, rented several apartments in Manhattan during her long career. She had a home in Arlington, Virginia, and kept a summer home on a small island in Lake Placid, New York.

===Religion===
After attending services at a Catholic parish for 25 years, Smith converted to Roman Catholicism in 1965. During the time she spent in Lake Placid, she regularly attended Sunday Mass at St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church and could be heard singing the hymns in her contralto voice.

==Death==
In her later years, Smith was impaired by diabetes. In 1976, she suffered brain damage after slipping into a diabetic coma. After she emerged from the coma, her family helped her move in 1979 to Raleigh. In January 1986, Smith&#x27;s right leg was amputated due to poor circulation caused by diabetes. Five months later, she underwent a mastectomy. On June 17, 1986, Smith died of respiratory arrest at Raleigh Community Hospital in Raleigh at the age of 79.

Patricia Castledine (1939–2021) was Smith&#x27;s live-in nurse until Smith&#x27;s death. Castledine became the president of the Kate Smith Fan Club after Smith&#x27;s death and continued to hold that post until her own death in 2021.

For over a year following her death, Smith&#x27;s remains were stored in a vault at St. Agnes Cemetery in Lake Placid, while officials of St. Agnes Church and the singer&#x27;s executors engaged in a dispute over Smith&#x27;s request to be interred in a mausoleum on the cemetery&#x27;s grounds. Her private interment service was held on November 14, 1987.

==Legacy==
She did a command performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the White House on June 8, 1939. She received a Drake University medallion for &quot;outstanding contributions to radio and the people&quot;. Smith was inducted posthumously into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1999. She was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2010, the U.S. postal service issued a commemorative stamp featuring a duplication of artwork created for the cover of a CD titled &quot;Kate Smith: The Songbird of the South&quot;. The artwork was based on a photograph of Smith taken in the 1960s.

On October 26, 1982, Smith received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America&#x27;s highest civilian honor, by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. In bestowing the honor, Reagan said:

The voice of Kate Smith is known and loved by millions of Americans, young and old. In war and peace, it has been an inspiration. Those simple but deeply moving words, &quot;God bless America&quot;, have taken on added meaning for all of us because of the way Kate Smith sang them. Thanks to her they have become a cherished part of all our lives, an undying reminder of the beauty, the courage, and the heart of this great land of ours. In giving us a magnificent, selfless talent like Kate Smith, God has truly blessed America.

It was not the first time Smith had been saluted by a president. In 1969, in light of Jim Morrison&#x27;s arrest in Miami for indecent exposure, Smith had performed with The Lettermen, Anita Bryant, and Jackie Gleason in a concert demonstration against indecency, for which President Richard Nixon commended the stars&#x27; performances.

<doc id="615311" wikidata="Q7962124" url="?curid=615311" title="Walk the Tightrope">
<text>Walk the Tightrope is the fourth studio album by Australian boy band and pop vocal group Human Nature released on 26 April 2004. After a three-year absence since their greatest hits album, &quot;Here &amp; Now: The Best of Human Nature&quot;, the group returned with a more adult-contemporary sound, presaging their future move to nostalgia type covers.

==Making of the album==

The first single &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; was written by Darren Hayes, formerly of Savage Garden, and reached the top 10 in Australia in April 2004 (the song was also covered by Clay Aiken). The music video was shot at a petrol station in Homebush, New South Wales, in the dead of night.

The album also features a cover version of &quot;To Be with You&quot;, a 1992 hit by glam metal band Mr. Big.

Andrew Tierney of the band says on the group&#x27;s official website that performing an unrecorded Bee Gees song given to the band by Barry Gibb was a particular thrill. &quot;The Bee Gees were, without a doubt, the major inspiration for this record. We looked at them, and above their image and what they wore, the thing that kept them current was the fact they consistently came up with incredible songs. Great songs sustain a career. So with this record, we just wanted great songs.&quot;

<doc id="615313" wikidata="Q7354966" url="?curid=615313" title="Rockbank, Victoria">
<text>Rockbank is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Melton local government area. Rockbank recorded a population of 2,583 at the 2021 census.

The land contains many large volcanic rocks making it poor for cultivating crops. The rocks have been used to build walls between paddocks – characteristic of the area west of Melbourne. The rich, red volcanic soil in the area has helped build the reputation of local wineries.

Rockbank is also the host to Victoria&#x27;s annual Olive Festival.

== History ==
Earlier agricultural activities in Rockbank date back to the pastoral exploits of William Cross Yuille on the plains. He founded the pastoral estate of Rockbank, which soon became the largest estate in the Melton district. The former Rockbank pastoral station is now known as the Deanside Woolshed.

Rockbank Post Office opened on 1 January 1862 and closed on 1 July 1996.

New Cambridge Common School (now Rockbank Primary School) opened on 12 October 1868 and is one of Victoria&#x27;s oldest public schools.

Following a proposal for eleven new suburbs by the City of Melton, the northern portion of Rockbank became the suburb of Aintree in 2017.

<doc id="615314" wikidata="Q3630527" url="?curid=615314" title="Automatic Man">
<text>Automatic Man was an American rock band from San Francisco. Consisting of well-respected musicians of diverse backgrounds within the rock, funk and jazz communities of the mid-1970s, Automatic Man played progressive rock and space rock.

Despite a well-reviewed 1976 eponymous début on Island Records and a lone charting single, 1976&#x27;s &quot;My Pearl&quot;, which reached No. 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100., the line-up of Automatic Man was not cohesive. After a second album entitled &quot;Visitors&quot;, they disbanded in 1977, retaining a small but very loyal, global cult following.

With both releases being reissued on CD in 2004 after 28 years of only being available in vinyl format and with the advent of the internet, Automatic Man are being rediscovered and roundly praised for their genre-defying, boundary-breaking musical sound and unique lyrics.

==Formation==
Automatic Man formed in San Francisco around 1975 when drummer Michael Shrieve decided to quit Santana to explore other musical avenues. That led him to work with ex-Traffic/Spencer Davis group singer/keyboardist Steve Winwood, percussionist Stomu Yamashta, and synthesizer player Klaus Schulze on the Go album, an album of experimental progressive rock that had been released by Island Records a year later. Pat Thrall was approached by Michael Shrieve in 1975 to audition for a band he was forming with Todd Cochran.

Cochran, then known under the alias of &quot;Bayete&quot; (pronounced Bye-yet-tay), was a child prodigy and formally trained keyboard player who had attended the Trinity College of Music in England as a teen. Cochran had already been part of the jazz scene for nearly a decade, playing with renowned jazz artists Bobby Hutcherson and Julian Priester. He also released two jazz-funk solo albums on Prestige Records in 1972 and 1973. Completing the lineup was bass guitarist Doni Harvey, who performed around the SF/Bay Area with his brothers and in blues, jazz, and soul bands, playing both bass and guitar. According to Harvey&#x27;s brother, Regi Harvey, Doni joined the band sheerly by chance,

During the break we heard a band practising in the big space. We went in to see who it was. It turned out to be &quot;Automatic Man&quot;. That night the bass man wasn&#x27;t working out and stomped out of the room. They spotted Don and asked him to sit in and to finish rehearsing. He stepped up to the plate that night. When they stopped for a break we went back in the small space we were practising in to finish. During that time they asked him to join the band. One of the reasons was that he played so well that they were that impressed. The other was that Doni and I had gone to Junior College with the keyboard player and main writer &quot;Bayete&quot; at the newly opened &quot;Skyline College&quot;.

Impressing Chris Blackwell, president of Island Records, he signed the band to a two-record deal.

==Debut album==
Rather than continue to build on their following in the San Francisco/Bay Area, Automatic Man headed for London. Automatic Man made Chelsea&#x27;s King&#x27;s Road in London their base of operations recording at Basing Street Studios now Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill and the legendary Olympic Studios with renowned recording engineer Keith Harwood. The self-titled debut album featured hard guitars and layered synthesizers. Allusions to space travel, Atlantis, astral projection, karma, angels, aliens, belly dancers and other mystical and exotic subjects are covered on nearly every album track. Cochran wrote the tracks &quot;Atlantis Rising-Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Coming Through&quot;, &quot;One and One&quot;, &quot;Newspapers&quot;, &quot;Geni-Geni&quot; and &quot;Turning of the Axis [Theme from Atlantis Rising]&quot;. He shares co-writing credits with band manager Lou CasaBianca on &quot;Automatic Man&quot;, &quot;Interstellar Tracking Devices&quot; and &quot;Right Back Down.&quot; The entire band and CasaBianca share writing credits on &quot;There&#x27;s A Way.&quot;

===Album art===
Painted by Bay Area artist Dwain Zerio (1950–1995), both front covers of each Automatic Man album feature a simple luminously painted blue alienlike face staring out from space. This &#x27;alien&#x27; face was meant to be representative of a human without a body, with just the spiritual energy or &#x27;aura&#x27; providing the visual shape. The debut album is blue on blue, while the follow-up features the blue face on a shocking pink and magenta background. The inside liner art of the first album includes the blue face with Egyptian wings, floating above a pyramid, rising Atlantis-like out of a raging ocean with a maelstrom in the background. The artwork for the &quot;My Pearl&quot; single featured a woman&#x27;s face suspended over a misty crevasse crowned with wings and a self-consuming serpentine rainbow.

The art work for both Automatic Man LP covers was entirely original, and one of the first times (possibly THE first) that an alien face had been depicted in a mass market medium; it bears more than a passing resemblance to the alien face which would be seen on countless bumperstickers and decals from the early 1990s onward. 
In the United Kingdom, the album was championed on BBC Radio 1 by Alan Freeman, who provided a voiceover for adverts for the album transmitted on the UK&#x27;s commercial radio stations.

===Original lineup dissolves===
After their album debut, Automatic Man promoted the disc with appearances at a number of European music festivals including the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. According to a later interview with Thrall, the band had trouble pulling off their material live. Part of the problem was that the technology of the era was too difficult to use live. Shrieve too would also recall that the band had not had enough chances to play live.

The band was also feted by fellow artists and luminaries of the day including the Rolling Stones and Hunter S Thompson who wrote a concert review. Though they would make a few more live appearances in their original Bay Area stomping grounds, infighting, clashes over music and disagreements over how the bands finances were being directed, this led to Automatic Man&#x27;s first line-up dissolving after returning to the United States in 1976.

==&quot;Visitors&quot;==

The second Automatic Man album was entitled &quot;Visitors&quot; and released in 1977 with a more accessible sound than their debut. Bayeté solely wrote each track. Guitarist Pat Thrall was still a member but Shrieve and Harvey were now replaced by bassist Jerome Rimson (also from the &quot;Go&quot; project) and drummer Glenn Symmonds. Originally from Detroit, Rimson played bass on the track &quot;Man from Manhattan&quot; which features on the album &quot;Ghost of a Smile&quot; with a pre-Queen Freddie Mercury on piano and vocals, and Brian May on Guitar. From 1974 he had been musical director for Van Morrison, playing on several tours and in 1976, he played on the Al Jarreau&#x27;s Grammy winning jazz album &quot;Glow&quot;. Glenn Symmonds had been Eddie Money&#x27;s drummer since 1974, departing to record and tour with ex-Santana percussionist Coke Escovedo.

===Critical reception to &quot;Visitors&quot;===
Fans of the band did not receive the second album as warmly. Music reviewer Doug Watson&#x27;s description is that &quot;Visitors&quot; is &quot;just a mediocre shot at mesh funk-rock, although arguably ahead of its time in predicting the ghastly and overblown rock guitar productions of the 80s.&quot; However, the record collector&#x27;s website Progrography declared,

... Visitors isn&#x27;t a concept album. It&#x27;s also not the commercial sellout that some have mistakenly branded it. Like the music of Santana, Automatic Man was on a quasi-mystical quest that relied on the conventional language of funk/rock but also rode beyond those borders in pursuit of a grander statement. It&#x27;s probably on that last point that prog fans have hung their hat, but Visitors is not a progressive rock album. Bayete&#x27;s bid to be a rock star ended with the Automatic Man albums, leaving behind two impressive albums that bespeak the transitional phase between jazz, disco and ambitious (if not progressive) rock as well as any records from the period.

===Band breakup===
Partially due to no longer having the name recognition of Shrieve, the album failed to make waves in the music press and Automatic Man permanently disbanded in 1977.

==Afterward==
All four members of the original Automatic Man line up became prolific and well respected solo and session musicians with Shrieve and Cochran emerging as sought after composers and arrangers. Lou CasaBianca, the band&#x27;s manager and co-producer for the first disc, moved into video production and media technology writing. Glenn Symmonds and Jerome Rimson, drummer and bassist on Visitors respectively, continued on in the music industry to steady work and success as well, with Rimson writing an autobiography. There has, to date, been no talk of a possible Automatic Man reunion.

===Michael Shrieve===
After leaving Automatic Man, Shrieve continued to be one of the most sought after drummers in the music world. His credits number well into the hundreds and include work on Pete Townshend&#x27;s 1981 disc, &quot;All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes&quot; and for artists Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison, Steve Winwood, Police guitarist Andy Summers, film composer Mark Isham, Freddie Hubbard, Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, Zakir Hussain, Airto Moreira and Amon Tobin. Michael Shrieve also composes music for film and television, working with Paul Mazursky on the film, &quot;Tempest&quot; and scored music for Curtis Hanson&#x27;s &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot;. In the early 1980s, his power pop quartet, Novo Combo scored minor hits with the songs &quot;Up Periscope&quot; and &quot;City Bound.&quot; A few years later (1983), Shrieve got involved with the power group HSAS, featuring Sammy Hagar, Neal Schon of Journey fame and former bass player from Derringer Kenny Aaronson. The group recorded the album &quot;Through the Fire&quot; and the single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, originally written and performed by Procol Harum, peaked at #94 in 1984.

Shrieve is also the past President of the Pacific Northwest Branch of the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), and is currently writing the memoirs of jazz drumming legend Elvin Jones. He also serves as musical director for Seattle Theatre Group&#x27;s &quot;More Music at The Moore,&quot; a program that highlights gifted young musicians from Seattle&#x27;s various cultural groups. In 1998, Shrieve was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Santana. He also received the Guitar Center&#x27;s first annual &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; in 2005.

===Todd Cochran===
Todd Cochran&#x27;s career continued to see many radical musical shifts in direction as he wrote, produced, performed keyboards, guitar and/or synthesizer programming for a widely diverse number of artists including Aretha Franklin, Eminem, Maynard Ferguson, Juan Carlos Quintero, Stewart Copeland, Peter Gabriel and Grover Washington Jr in genres that included funk, new age, jazz, disco and combinations thereof. He was a member of Fuse One, a coalition of jazz musicians who released two albums on CTI Records in 1980 and 1981. Since 2000, Cochran has been primarily establishing himself as a film composer, as well as re-engaging with classical composition which he had explored at the start of his musical career. His first full soundtrack was for Doug McHenry&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Keep the Faith, Baby&quot; from 2002, a portrait of the black senator Adam Clayton Powell. In 2004 he composed the music for the critically acclaimed, &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed&quot;, an adaptation of Bishop T.D. Jakes&#x27; self-help novel, it won the Best Film Award at the &quot;American Black Film Festival&quot;.
In 2006, Robert L. Watt, Assistant Principal French horn with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, commissioned Todd Cochran to write a musical composition in memory of Miles Davis. This resulted in a piece called &quot;Missing Miles&quot; – a suite for horn and piano. Film director Kim Bass made a thirteen-minute film, also called &quot;Missing Miles&quot;, which chronicled the creation of the composition and a performance of the work. In the Feb 2007 issue of &quot;Film Music Magazine&quot; called &quot;Ebony and Ivory: The Door Only Swings One Way&quot;, focused on how black composers often only get offered &quot;black&quot; films. In the article, Todd referenced the limitations placed on black composers by the entertainment world,

two people can go through the same training – the same schools – and reach the same level of ability, and as soon as they step out of the schools, (and come to Hollywood) one is a black composer, and the other is just a composer ... unfortunately the need for African American film composers to deconstruct the existing stereotypes of musical aesthetic limitations persists.

===Pat Thrall===
Thrall went on to work in the fusion field with musicians including Narada Michael Walden and Alphonso Johnson. In 1978, Thrall was chosen from seventy auditioning guitarists for the co-lead spot with Pat Travers. He recorded on three LPs with Travers: &quot;Heat in the Street&quot;, &quot;Go For What You Know&quot; and &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;. The latter LP featured the FM hit, &quot;Snortin&#x27; Whiskey&quot;, which Thrall co-wrote with Travers. He won &quot;Best New Guitar Player&quot; in the 1980 Guitar Player Magazine readers poll. &quot;In 1987 he recorded and toured with Bruce Springsteen guitarist and producer Little Steven Van Zandt. 1988 found Thrall touring with Jack Bruce of &quot;Cream&quot; fame. Thrall later joined Asia, and played lead guitar for a resurgent Meat Loaf during the 1990s. He has also recorded with Beyoncé, Elton John, Tina Turner and Dave Stewart, to name a few. Thrall has also lent his talent and support behind causes such as Nelson Mandela&#x27;s foundation to fight AIDS in Africa.

Thrall was nominated for a Grammy on Beyonce&#x27;s &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;. He was also nominated for two Grammys on Frank Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Channel Orange&quot; album.

Thrall&#x27;s most acclaimed work, post-Travers, is undoubtedly the &#x27;Hughes/Thrall&#x27; album from 1982, featuring Glenn Hughes on vocals and bass. A fusion of rock/synth/metal/pop, it is now considered a &#x27;musician&#x27;s favorite&#x27;, going virtually unnoticed by the public at the time. Hughes and Thrall worked together on and off for the next 15 years, and planned on releasing &#x27;Hughes/Thrall 2&#x27; in 2004, but Thrall&#x27;s full-time work as a producer for other artists, and Hughes touring and recording schedule proved to be to much for them to complete the album.

===Doni Harvey===
Harvey went on to do session and live gigs in many different arenas both in Northern California and internationally, including playing on the film soundtrack of The Spy Who Loved Me and in his own power trio, HARVEY. His credits include backing Clarence Clemons and replacing Allan Holdsworth as the guitarist in Gong for a spell. In 1988, he joined the San Francisco-based World Music band, The Caribbean Allstars, as guitarist and backing vocalist. Harvey has been playing with the Caribbean Allstars for over two decades. He currently helms the group, &quot;Doni Harvey and Deeper Shade of Blue&quot; and together with fellow musicians Isis and Andy Jonson, formed The Unemployed Blues Band. Doni also became a permanent member of his brother&#x27;s band Regi Harvey&#x27;s Example, the latter of whom died on April, 25th, 2010. Doni himself died on June 6, 2011.

===Jerome Rimson===
Rimson continued working steadily with Van Morrison until 1984 and still works with him intermittently. He played bass on The &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; soundtrack for the notorious Bee Gees movie. He also collaborated extensively with Thin Lizzy&#x27;s Phil Lynott and together they produced the first independent single ever released by a Dublin based band called Blue Russia, released on Vixen Records in Ireland in 1983. Rimson has played or sung on albums for Steve Winwood, Donovan, Topper Headon formerly of The Clash, Ron Roesing the drummer of the Smashing Pumpkins and many others. He now lives in Cork, Ireland teaching master classes on music production and theory. He has finished his autobiography, &quot;Renegade&quot; which he describes as his life experiences in &quot;the biz&quot; and the countless people he has met on his journey, including &quot;...  Phil Lynott&#x27;s last years, from rock n roll on the road to his life now in Ireland.&quot;

===Glenn Symmonds===
From his base in L.A. Symmonds continued to tour and record with many diverse musical groups including Steve Perry, John Klemmer, Elvin Bishop, Dave Mason, Duncan Sheik and Etta James. It was in 1986 while touring with The Untouchables he once again joined forces with Eddie Money and has been drumming for him for over two decades. Now, based out of Nashville, Glenn Symmonds describe himself as a &quot;...  Drummer, guitarist, singer, songwriter, teacher, father&quot;.

==Remastered CD==
In 2004, Cherry Red released, under their UK based Lemon subsidiary, a remastered version of Automatic Man to receptive music collectors. There has been controversy on the internet as to whether the original master tapes were used or not used by Lemon UK in the remastering process. Tom Karr of Progressive World gave the disc a five star rating in his review,

People have a strong desire, an urge, to categorize things, to put them in boxes. To place this with that and make order out of disorder. Music is one of those things we have to make sense of, to understand. How can some obscure band be so important? They are very, very good at what they do. This isn&#x27;t a progressive rock band is it? Yes, they are, absolutely. If a visionary assemblage of influences and the power of moving music forward, are progressive, and for the purposes of this review, I will say it is, then this is fine progressive rock, indeed. And no, in the sense of Automatic Man fitting into a preconceived subgenre of progressive rock as understood now is concerned, then no, they are not a prog band, but they are much, much more than any label given them could describe. This San Francisco band had strong elements of spacey synthesizer driven progressive. Definitely. They could just as well be described as a hard rocking funk band as well. Both are true. Neither is accurate. No group I can think of so defies categorization as does Automatic Man.

Due to the overwhelming success of Automatic Man&#x27;s re-release on Compact Disc, Lemon recordings also re-released, Visitors in 2005.

<text>The Australian Catholic Church or Catholic Church in Australia is part of the worldwide Catholic Church under the spiritual and administrative leadership of the Holy See. From origins as a suppressed, mainly Irish minority in early colonial times, the church has grown to be the largest Christian denomination in Australia, with a culturally diverse membership of around 5,075,907 people, representing about 20% of the overall population of Australia according to the 2021 ABS Census data.

The church is the largest non-government provider of welfare and education services in Australia. Catholic Social Services Australia aids some 450,000 people annually, while the St Vincent de Paul Society&#x27;s 40,000 members form the largest volunteer welfare network in the country. In 2016, the church had some 760,000 students in more than 1,700 schools.

The church in Australia has five provinces: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. It has 35 dioceses, comprising geographic areas as well as the military diocese and dioceses for the Chaldean, Maronite, Melkite, Syro-Malabar (St Thomas Christians), and Ukrainian Rites. The national assembly of bishops is the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference (ACBC). There are a further 175 Catholic religious orders operating in Australia, affiliated under Catholic Religious Australia. One Australian has been recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church: Mary MacKillop, who co-founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (&quot;Josephite&quot;) religious institute in the 19th century.

==Demographics==
Since the 1980s, Catholicism has been largest Christian denomination in Australia, constituting around one-quarter of the overall population and becoming slightly larger than the Anglican and Uniting churches combined. Up until the , adherents had been recorded as growing both numerically and as a percentage of the population; however, the 2016 census found a fall in both overall numbers and the percentage of Catholics as a proportion of Australian residents, with 5,291,839 Australian Catholics (around 22.6% of the population) in 2016, down from 5,439,257 in the (25.3% of the population). This was repeated again in 2021, with the numbers dropping to 5,075,907 people, representing about 20% of the overall population of Australia according to the 2021 ABS Census data.[1]

Until the , Australia&#x27;s most populous Christian church was the Anglican Church of Australia. Since then, Catholics have outnumbered Anglicans by an increasing margin. The change is partly explained by changes in immigration patterns. Before the Second World War, the majority of immigrants to Australia came from the United Kingdom and most Catholic immigrants came from Ireland. After the war, Australia&#x27;s immigration diversified, and more than 6.5 million migrants arrived in the following 60 years, including more than a million Catholics from Italy, Malta, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Croatia and Hungary.

At the 2016 Census, the ancestries with which Australian Catholics most identified were English (1.49 million), Australian (1.12 million), Irish (577,000), Italian (567,000) and Filipino (181,000).

Despite a growing population of Catholics, weekly Mass attendance has declined from an estimated 74% in the mid-1950s to around 14% in 2006.

There are seven archdioceses and 32 dioceses, with an estimated 3,000 priests and 9,000 men and women in institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life, including six dioceses that cover the whole country: one each for those who belong to the Chaldean, Maronite, Melkite, Syro-Malabar and Ukrainian rites and one for those serving in the Australian Defence Forces. There is also a personal ordinariate for former Anglicans, which has a similar status to a diocese.
==History==

===Arrival and suppression===
Since time immemorial, indigenous people in Australia had performed the rites and rituals of the animist religions of the Dreamtime. Among the first Catholics known to have sighted Australia were the crew of a Spanish expedition of 1605–6. In 1606, the expedition&#x27;s leader, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros landed in the New Hebrides, believing it to be the fabled southern continent. He named the land Austrialis del Espiritu Santo &quot;Southern Land of the Holy Spirit&quot;. Later that year, his deputy Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea.

The permanent presence of Catholicism in Australia came rather with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. One-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at least half of them were born in Ireland. A small proportion of British marines were also Catholic.

Just as the British were setting up the new colony, French captain Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse arrived off Botany Bay with two ships. La Pérouse was 6 weeks in Botany Bay, where the French, besides other things, held Catholic Masses. The crew conducted the first Catholic burial, that of Father Louis Receveur, a Franciscan friar who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay.

Some of the Irish convicts had been transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of Catholicism for the first three decades of settlement.

Catholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Anglicans. The first Catholic priests arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 – James Harold, James Dixon and Peter O&#x27;Neill, who had been convicted for &quot;complicity&quot; in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from curtains and with a chalice made of tin, he conducted the first Catholic Mass in &quot;New South Wales&quot;. The Irish-led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and Dixon&#x27;s permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Fr Jeremiah O&#x27; Flinn, an Irish Cistercian monk, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland and set out from Britain for the colony, uninvited. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the colony in 1820 – John Joseph Therry and Philip Conolly. The foundation stone for the first St Mary&#x27;s Church, was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.

The absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English Benedictine monks to lead the early church in the colony. The Reverend William Bernard Ullathorne (1806–1889) was instrumental in influencing Pope Gregory XVI to establish the hierarchy in Australia. Ullathorne was in Australia from 1833 to 1836 as vicar-general to Bishop William Morris of Mauritius, whose jurisdiction extended over the Australian missions.

=== Emancipation and growth ===
The Church of England was disestablished in the colony of New South Wales by the &quot;Church Act of 1836&quot;, which also provided equal funding of Protestant and Catholic churches. Drafted by the Catholic attorney-general John Plunkett, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists. Nevertheless, social attitudes were slow to change. A laywoman, Caroline Chisholm (1808–1877), faced discouragements and anti-Catholic feeling when she sought to establish a migrant women&#x27;s shelter. She worked for women&#x27;s welfare in the colonies in the 1840s, though her humanitarian efforts later won her fame in England and great influence in achieving support for families in the colony.


The church&#x27;s most prominent early leader was John Bede Polding, a Benedictine monk who was Sydney&#x27;s first bishop (and then archbishop) from 1835 to 1877. Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838. While tensions arose between the English Benedictine hierarchy and the Irish, Ignatian-tradition religious institute from the start, the sisters set about pastoral care in a women&#x27;s prison and began visiting hospitals and schools and establishing employment for convict women. In 1847, two sisters transferred to Hobart and established a school. The sisters went on to establish hospitals in four of the eastern states, beginning with St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, in 1857 as a free hospital for all people, but especially for the poor.

At Polding&#x27;s request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools. Again jurisdictional tensions arose and the brothers returned to Ireland. In 1857, Polding founded an Australian religious institute in the Benedictine tradition – the Sisters of the Good Samaritan – to work in education and social work. While Polding was in office, construction began on the ambitious Gothic Revival designs for St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, and the final St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney.

In 1845, Polding established the Australian Holy Catholic Guild of Saints Mary and Joseph. Some parishes have memorials dedicated to deceased members and friends. One such is at St Patrick&#x27;s Boorowa, New South Wales. Examples of the Guild&#x27;s reporting to members and election of office bearers can be seen in the Freeman&#x27;s Journal. In 1848, they met under St Patrick&#x27;s Church at the intersection of George and Hunter streets and had 250 members at that time. Records of the association, from 1845 to 1996, are held at the NSW State Library and this includes a copy of the constitution of the guild.

Establishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in the newly established colony of South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory – Austrian Jesuits established themselves in the south and north and Irish in the east. The goldrush saw an increase in the population and prosperity of the colonies and called for an increase in the number of episcopal sees. When gold was discovered in late 1851, there were an estimated 9,000 Catholics in the Colony of Victoria, increasing to 100,000 by the time the Jesuits arrived 14 years later. While the Austrian priests traversed the Outback on horseback to found missions and schools, the Irish priests arrived in the east in 1860 and had by 1880 established the major schools of Xavier College in Melbourne and in Sydney St Aloysius&#x27; College and Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview – which each survive to the present.

During 1869 and 1870, some Australian based clergy attended the first Vatican Council in Rome.

Despite anti-Irish lobbying by English Catholic bishops and the British government, Irish cleric Patrick Francis Moran won the favour of Pope Leo XIII and was appointed Archbishop of Sydney in 1884, arriving in New South Wales on 8 September. A prominent figure in Australian Catholic history, he became Australia&#x27;s first cardinal the following year after being summoned back to Rome, and presided over Plenary Councils of Australasia in 1885, 1895 and 1905 which laid the foundations for Church structure in the 20th century. The Australian colonies had hitherto relied heavily on immigrant clergy. In 1889, Moran founded St Patrick&#x27;s College, Manly, intended to provide priests for all the colonies. Moran believed that Catholics&#x27; political and civil rights were threatened in Australia and, in 1896, saw deliberate discrimination in a situation where &quot;no office of first, or even second, rate importance is held by a Catholic&quot;.

In Rome in 1884, Moran had met the Venerable Mary Potter and invited her to send a group of her newly established Little Company of Mary sisters to Australia in order to establish a local congregation. Six pioneering sisters arrived in Sydney in November 1885, commencing work caring for the sick and dying. Establishing a convent at Lewishman, they had nearly fifty members within just five years. In 1889 they opened a small hospital at Lewisham. Under the leadership of Mother Mary Xavier Lynch from 1899, the hospital would grow to be one of Sydney&#x27;s leading general hospitals and nursing schools. Mother Mary Xavier established a new hospital at Adelaide in 1900 and Wagga Wagga in 1926, and despatched sisters to found hospitals in New Zealand and South Africa. In 1922 she became the order&#x27;s first provincial of Australasia, and is remembered as one of Australia&#x27;s most noted hospital and nursing administrators.

The Catholic Church also became involved in mission work among the Aboriginal people of Australia during the 19th century as Europeans came to control much of the continent. According to Aboriginal anthropologist Kathleen Butler-McIlwraith, there were many occasions when the Catholic Church attempted to advocate for Aboriginal rights, but the missionaries were also &quot;functionaries of the Protection and Assimilation policies&quot; of the government and so &quot;directly contributed to the current disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australians&quot;. The missionaries themselves argued that they protected children from dysfunctional aspects of indigenous culture.

With the withdrawal of state aid for church schools around 1880, the Catholic Church, unlike other Australian churches, put great energy and resources into creating a comprehensive alternative system of education. It was largely staffed by sisters, brothers and priests of religious institutes, such as the Christian Brothers (who had returned to Australia in 1868); the Sisters of Mercy (who had arrived in Perth in 1846); Marist Brothers, who came from France in 1872; and the Sisters of St Joseph, founded in Australia by Mary MacKillop and Fr Julian Tenison Woods in 1867. MacKillop travelled throughout Australasia and established schools, convents and charitable institutions but came into conflict with those bishops who preferred diocesan control of the institute rather than central control from Adelaide by the Josephite religious institute. MacKillop administered the Josephites as a national religious institute at a time when Australia was divided among individually governed colonies. She is today the most revered of Australian Catholics, beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995 and canonised by Benedict XVI in 2010. Catholic schools flourished in Australia and by 1900 there were 115 Christian Brothers teaching in Australia. By 1910 there were 5000 religious sisters teaching in schools.

===Federation===


The Australian Constitution of 1901 guaranteed Freedom of Religion and the separation of church and state throughout Australia. Australia&#x27;s first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran (1830–1911), had been a proponent of Australian Federation but in 1901 he refused to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Commonwealth of Australia because precedence was given to the Church of England. He was criticised in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; for speaking against racist immigration laws and he alarmed Catholic conservatives by supporting Trade Unionism and the newly formed Australian Labor Party.

The Catholic Church was rooted in the working class Irish communities. Moran, the Archbishop of Sydney from 1884 to 1911, believed that Catholicism would flourish with the emergence of the new nation through Federation in 1901, provided that his people rejected &quot;contamination&quot; from foreign influences such as anarchism, socialism, modernism and secularism. Moran distinguished between European socialism as an atheistic movement and those Australians calling themselves &quot;socialists&quot;; he approved of the objectives of the latter while feeling that the European model was not a real danger in Australia. Moran&#x27;s outlook reflected his wholehearted acceptance of Australian democracy and his belief in the country as different and freer than the old societies from which its people had come. Moran thus welcomed the Labor Party and the Catholic Church stood with it in opposing conscription in the referendums of 1916 and 1917. The hierarchy had close ties to Rome, which encouraged the bishops to support the British Empire and emphasize Marian piety.

===Between the wars===

Another Irish cleric, Archbishop Daniel Mannix (1864–1963) of Melbourne, was a controversial voice against conscription during World War I and against British Empire policy in Ireland. He was also a fervent critic of contraception. In 1920, the Royal Navy prevented him landing in his Irish homeland. In the Melbourne St Patrick&#x27;s day parade of 1920, Archbishop Mannix participated with fourteen Victoria Cross recipients. Yet despite early 20th century sectarian feeling, Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin, of the Australian Labor Party in 1929 – decades before the Protestant majority of the United States would elect John F. Kennedy as its first Catholic president. His successor, Joseph Lyons, a devout Irish Catholic, split from Labor to form the fiscally conservative United Australia Party – predecessor to the modern Liberal Party of Australia. His wife, Dame Enid Lyons, a Catholic convert, became the first female member of the Australian House of Representatives and later first female member of cabinet in the Menzies Government. With the place of Catholics in the British Empire still complicated by the recent Irish War of Independence and centuries of imperial rivalry with Catholic European nations, as prime minister, Lyons travelled to London in 1935 for the silver jubilee celebrations of King George V and faced anti-Catholic demonstrations in Edinburgh, then visited his ancestral homeland of Ireland and also had an audience with the Pope in Rome.

The Australian congregation known as Our Lady&#x27;s Nurses for the Poor was founded by Melbourne-born mystic Eileen O&#x27;Connor and Fr Ted McGrath in a rented home at Coogee in 1913. A deeply religious youth, O&#x27;Connor had suffered a damaged spine when she was three years old and lived in a wheelchair with a painful disability. McGrath, the parish priest of Coogee, found accommodation for her widowed mother and family and was impressed by her courage. O&#x27;Connor told McGrath that she had experienced a visitation from the Virgin Mary, and McGrath shared with her his hope to establish a congregation of nurses to serve the poor. Eventually, a group of seven laywomen gathered around O&#x27;Connor and elected her as their first superior. Directed by the largely bed-ridden O&#x27;Connor, they visited the sick poor and nursed the frail aged. O&#x27;Connor died in 1921 of chronic tuberculosis of the spine and exhaustion. She was 28. Initially a group of laywomen, Our Lady&#x27;s Nurses for the Poor later formed themselves into a religious community of sisters under vows and their work continues in Sydney, Newcastle and Macquarie Fields. In 2018, Australia&#x27;s bishops voted to initiate her cause for sainthood and the Holy See granted her the title Servant of God.

In October 1916, the Catholic Women&#x27;s Social Guild (now Catholic Women&#x27;s League) was formed in Fitzroy, Victoria, and Mary Glowrey became the inaugural president. Glowrey was one of the first women to study medicine at Melbourne University. She later went to India to become a missionary nun, founding the largest non-government healthcare system in that country. She was accorded the title Servant of God in 2013 and her cause for sainthood is underway.

The Australian Army Chaplains Department was promulgated in 1913, and 86 Catholic chaplains went on to serve in the army during World War One. As well as conducting church parades and religious services, chaplains organised activities to improve the morale and welfare of the troops. Fr John Fahey from Perth was the longest-serving front-line chaplain of the conflict. Assigned to the 11th battalion, he was the first chaplain ashore on Gallipoli, after disregarding orders to stay on the ship.

During the Second World War, the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea was invaded by Japanese forces. Some 333 Martyrs of New Guinea are remembered from all denominations during WW2, including 197 Catholics. On Rabaul, Australians and Europeans found refuge at the Vunapope Catholic Mission, until the Japanese overwhelmed the island and took them prisoner in 1942. The local Bishop Leo Scharmach, a Pole, convinced the Japanese that he was German and to spare the internees. A group of indigenous Daughters of Mary Immaculate (FMI Sisters) then refused to give up their faith or abandon the Australians and are credited with keeping hundreds of internees alive for three and half years by growing food and delivering it to them over gruelling distances. Some of the Sisters were tortured by the Japanese and gave evidence during war crimes trials after the war. Indigenous Rabaul man Peter To Rot found himself in charge of the mission at Rakunai after the internment of the Europeans. He took on their work of teaching the faith, presiding over baptisms, prayer and marriages and caring for the sick and POWs. When the Japanese outlawed these practises, he continued them in secret, was exposed by a collaborator and sent to a labour camp where he was executed. Pope John Paul II declared him a martyr in 1993 and beatified him in 1995.

===Post-war immigration: A more diverse church===
Until about 1950, the Catholic Church in Australia was overwhelmingly Irish in its ethos. Most Catholics were descendants of Irish immigrants and the church was mostly led by Irish-born priests and bishops. A number of rural areas had high proportions of Irish and a strongly Catholic culture. From 1950 the ethnic composition of the church began to change, with the assimilation of Irish Australians and the arrival of Eastern European Displaced Persons from 1948 and more than one million Catholics from countries such as Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, Croatia and Hungary, and later Filipinos, Vietnamese, Lebanese and Poles around the 1980s. There are now also strong Chinese, Korean and Hispanic Catholic communities.

For a long time, Irish-Australians had a close political association with the Labor Party. The changing ethnic composition of Australian Catholicism and shifting political allegiances of Australian Catholics saw Catholic layman B. A. Santamaria, the son of Italian immigrants, lead a movement of working class Catholics against Communism in Australia and the formation of his Democratic Labor Party (DLP) in 1955. The DLP was formed over concerns of Communist influence over the trade unions and Labor Party. The movement was not approved by the Vatican, but it siphoned a proportion of the Catholic vote away from the Labor Party, contributing to the success of the newly formed Liberal Party of Robert Menzies, which held power from 1949 to 1972, which, in return for DLP preferences, secured state aid for Catholic schools in Australia in 1963. Along with a sharp decline in sectarianism in post-1960s Australia, sectarian loyalty to political parties has diminished and Catholics have been well represented within the conservative Liberal and National parties. Brendan Nelson became the first Catholic to lead the Liberal Party in 2007. Former prime minister Tony Abbott is a former seminarian who won the party leadership after defeating two other Catholic candidates for the post. In 2008, Tim Fischer, a Catholic and former deputy prime minister in the Howard government, was nominated by the Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd, as the first resident Australian ambassador to the Holy See since 1973, when diplomatic relations with the Vatican and Australia were first established.

=== Post Second Vatican Council ===

Since the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, the Australian church has experienced a decline in vocations to the religious life, leading to a priest shortage. On the other hand, lay leadership in education and other areas has expanded, and about 20% of Australian school students attend a Catholic school. While the numbers of nuns serving in Australian health facilities declined, the church maintained a strong presence in health care. The Sisters of Charity continued their mission among the sick, opening Australia&#x27;s first HIV AIDS ward at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, in the 1980s. Declining vocations and increasing complexities in the health care technologies and management saw religious institutes like the Sisters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy amalgamating their efforts and divesting themselves of daily management of hospitals.

Following Vatican II, new styles of ministry were tried by Australian religious. Some rose to national prominence. Fr Ted Kennedy began one such ministry in Sydney&#x27;s inner city Redfern presbytery in 1971 – an area with a large Aboriginal population. Working closely with Catholic Aboriginal laywoman &quot;Mum&quot; Shirl Smith, he developed a theology which held that the poor had special insights into the meaning of Christianity, worked as an advocate for Aboriginal rights and often challenged the civil and church establishment on questions of conscience. In 1989, Jesuit lawyer Fr Frank Brennan AO founded Uniya, a centre for social justice and human rights research, advocacy, education and networking. Uniya focused much of its attention on the plight of refugees, asylum seekers, and Indigenous reconciliation. In 1991, Fr Chris Riley formed Youth Off The Streets, a community organisation working for young people who are &quot;chronically homeless, drug dependent and recovering from abuse&quot;. Originally a food van in Sydney&#x27;s King&#x27;s Cross, it has grown to be one of the largest youth services in Australia, offering crisis accommodation, residential rehabilitation, clinical services and counselling, outreach programs, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, specialist Aboriginal services, education and family support. Melbourne priest Father Bob Maguire began parish work in the 1960s, but became a youth media personality in 2004 with the beginning of a series of collaborations with irreverent satirist John Safran on SBS TV and Triple J radio.

The year 1970 saw the first visit to Australia by a Pope, Paul VI. Pope John Paul II was the next Pope to visit Australia in 1986. At Alice Springs, the Pope made an historic address to indigenous Australians, in which he praised the enduring qualities of Aboriginal culture, lamented the effects of dispossession of and discrimination; called for acknowledgment of Aboriginal land rights and reconciliation in Australia; and said that the church in Australia would not reach its potential until Aboriginal people had made their &quot;contribution to her life and until that contribution has been joyfully received by others&quot;.

In 1988, the Archbishop of Sydney, Edward Bede Clancy was created a cardinal and during the Australian Bicentenary celebrations led the religious ceremonies for the opening of Parliament House, Canberra. Pope John Paul II visited Australia for the second time in 1995, to perform the rite of beatification for Mary MacKillop, founder of Australia&#x27;s Josephite Sisters, before a crowd of 250,000.

From the late 1980s, cases of abuse within the Catholic Church and other child care institutions began to be exposed in Australia. In 1996, the church issued a document, &quot;Towards Healing&quot;, which it described as seeking to &quot;establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse&quot;. In 2001, an apostolic exhortation from Pope John Paul II condemned incidents of sex abuse in Oceania. Impetus for the &quot;Towards Healing&quot; protocols was in part led by Bishop Geoffrey Robinson, who would later call for large scale systemic reform of the church globally in his 2007 book &quot;Confronting Power and Sex in the Catholic Church: Reclaiming the Spirit of Jesus&quot;. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference did not endorse the book. Pat Power, the Auxiliary Bishop of Canberra &amp; Goulburn, wrote in 2002 that &quot;the current crisis around sexual abuse is the greatest since the Reformation. At stake is the Church&#x27;s moral authority, its credibility, its ability to interpret the &#x27;signs of the times&#x27; and its capacity to confront the ensuing questions.&quot; Pope Benedict XVI officially apologised to victims during World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney and celebrated a Mass with four victims of clerical sexual abuse in the chapel of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, and listened to their stories.

In 2001, in Rome, Pope John Paul II apologised to Aboriginal and other indigenous people in Oceania for past injustices by the church: &quot;Aware of the shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples in Oceania, the Synod Fathers apologised unreservedly for the part played in these by members of the church, especially where children were forcibly separated from their families.&quot; Church leaders in Australia called on the Australian government to offer a similar apology.

In 2001, George Pell became the eighth Archbishop of Sydney and, in 2003, became a cardinal. Pell supported Sydney&#x27;s bid to host World Youth Day 2008. In July 2008, Sydney hosted the massive youth festival led by Pope Benedict XVI. Around 500,000 welcomed the pope to Sydney and 270,000 watched the Stations of the Cross. More than 300,000 pilgrims camped out overnight in preparation for the final Mass, where final attendance was between 300,000 and 400,000 people.

In February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI announced that Mary MacKillop would be recognised as the first Australian saint of the Catholic Church. She was canonised on 17 October 2010 during a public ceremony in St Peter&#x27;s Square. An estimated 8,000 Australians were present in the Vatican City to witness the ceremony. The Vatican Museum held an exhibition of Aboriginal art to honour the occasion titled &quot;Rituals of Life&quot;. The exhibition contained 300 artefacts which were on display for the first time since 1925.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, Catholicism in Australia has been growing numerically, while remaining relatively stable as a proportion of the population and facing a long-term decline in numbers of people following vocations to the religious life. In 2016, the Catholic education sector ran 1,738 schools, accounting for some 20.2% of Australian school students. There were also two Catholic universities – University of Notre Dame Australia and the Australian Catholic University. Catholic Social Services Australia, the church&#x27;s peak national body for social services, had 52 member organisations providing services to hundreds of thousands of people each year. Catholic Health Australia was the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community, and aged care services.

The church was among the secular and religious institutions examined at the 2013-2017 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which reported that abuse cases by Catholic personnel had peaked in the 1970s, with around 4400 cases and alleged cases over the 6 decades prior to the inquiry. In 2017, there were 5.5 million Australian Catholics. Gerard Henderson stated that statistics presented to the Royal Commission indicated that children were safer in a Catholic religious institution in Australia during the years studied than in any other religious institution (state institutions were not studied, so a statistical comparison could not be made).

==Social and political engagement==
===Introduction===
Catholic people and charitable organisations, hospitals and schools have played a prominent role in welfare and education in Australia ever since colonial times when Catholic laywoman Caroline Chisholm helped single, migrant women and rescued homeless girls in Sydney. In his welcoming address to the Catholic World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney, the prime minister, Kevin Rudd, said that Christianity had been a positive influence on Australia: &quot;It was the church that began first schools for the poor, it was the church that began first hospitals for the poor, it was the church that began first refuges for the poor and these great traditions continue for the future&quot;.

===Welfare===

A number of Catholic organisations are providers of social welfare services (including residential aged care and the Job Network) and education in Australia. Australia-wide these include: Centacare, CatholicCare Caritas Australia, Jesuit Refugee Service, St Vincent de Paul Society, Youth Off The Streets. Two religious institutes founded in Australia which engaged in welfare and charity work are the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. Many international Catholic religious institutes also work in welfare, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor who work in aged care. Catholic Social Services Australia is the peak body for Catholic welfare agencies and has 54 member organisations in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia. Members include diocesan-based Centacare and CatholicCare agencies and those under the stewardship of religious orders.

===Health===
Catholic Health Australia is the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services in Australia. These do not operate for profit and range across the full spectrum of health services, representing about 10% of the health sector and employing 35,000 people.

Religious institutes founded many of Australia&#x27;s hospitals. Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in Sydney in 1838 and established St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. The Sisters went on to found hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. At St Vincent&#x27;s they trained leading surgeon Victor Chang and opened Australia&#x27;s first AIDS clinic. In the 21st century, with more and more lay people involved in management, the sisters began collaborating with Sisters of Mercy Hospitals in Melbourne and Sydney. Jointly the group operates four public hospitals, seven private hospitals and 10 aged care facilities.

The English Sisters of the Little Company of Mary arrived in 1885 and have since established public and private hospitals, retirement living and residential aged care, community care and comprehensive palliative care in New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Queensland (Cairns) and the Northern Territory.

The Little Sisters of the Poor, who follow the charism of Saint Jeanne Jugan to &quot;offer hospitality to the needy aged&quot;, arrived in Melbourne in 1884 and now operate four aged care homes in Australia.

In 1895, Perth&#x27;s Bishop Matthew Gibney sent a request for help to the Sisters of St John of God in Wexford, Ireland to care for people suffering from typhoid fever during the 1890s gold rush. They established a hospital in Kalgoorlie in the late 1890s, followed shortly by another in the Perth suburb of Subiaco. These services developed into St John of God Health Care, which now operates 24 hospitals and facilities across Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, and New Zealand.

===Education===

By 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies. Today one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools. There are over 1700 Catholic schools in Australia with more than 750,000 students enrolled, employing almost 60,000 teachers. Mary MacKillop was a 19th-century Australian religious sister who founded an educational religious institute, the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. Other Catholic religious institutes involved in education in Australia have included: Sisters of Mercy, Marist Brothers, Christian Brothers, Loreto Sisters, Benedictine Sisters and Jesuits.

As with other classes of non-government schools in Australia, Catholic schools receive funding from the Commonwealth Government. Church schools range from elite, high cost schools (which generally offer extensive bursary programs for low-income students) to low-fee local schools. Notable schools include the Jesuit colleges of St Aloysius and Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview in Sydney, Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Adelaide and Xavier College in Melbourne; the Marist Brothers St Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill, the Christian Brothers&#x27; High School, Lewisham, the Society of the Sacred Heart&#x27;s Rosebay Kincoppal School, the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x27;s Loreto Kirribilli, the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s Monte Sant&#x27; Angelo Mercy College, the Christian Brothers&#x27; St Edmund&#x27;s College, Canberra and Aquinas College, Perth – however, the list and range of Catholic primary and secondary schools in Australia is long and diverse and extends throughout metropolitan, regional and remote Australia: see Catholic Schools in Australia

The Australian Catholic University opened in 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia. These institutions had their origins in the 1800s, when religious institutes became involved in preparing teachers for Catholic schools and nurses for Catholic hospitals. The University of Notre Dame Australia opened in Western Australia in December 1989 and now has over 9,000 students on three campuses in Fremantle, Sydney and Broome.

===Politics===
Church leaders have often involved themselves in political issues in areas they consider relevant to Christian teachings. In early Colonial times, Catholicism was restricted but Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Early Catholic missionary William Ullathorne criticised the convict system, publishing a pamphlet, &quot;The Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded to the People&quot;, in Britain in 1837. Sydney&#x27;s first archbishop, John Bede Polding, was influential in the preparation of the Australian bishops&#x27; pastoral letter on Aboriginal People in 1869 which advocated for Aboriginal rights and dignity.

Australia&#x27;s first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran (1830–1911), was politically active. He was a proponent of Australian Federation; he denounced anti-Chinese legislation as &quot;unchristian&quot; and opposed antisemitism. He became an advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage and he stood for election to the Australasian Federal Convention in 1897, but in 1901 he refused to attend the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia because precedence was given to the Church of England. He alarmed conservatives by supporting trade unionism and &quot;Australian socialism&quot;. Archbishop Daniel Mannix of Melbourne was a controversial voice against conscription during World War I and against British policy in Ireland.

Mum (Shirl) Smith, a celebrated Redfern community worker, assisted by the Sisters of Charity, worked in the courts and organised prison visitations, medical and social assistance for Aboriginal People. Fr Ted Kennedy of Redfern and Fr Frank Brennan, a Jesuit, have been high-profile Catholic priests engaged in the cause of Aboriginal rights.

In 1999, Cardinal Edward Bede Clancy wrote to the then prime minister, John Howard, urging him to send an armed peacekeeping force to East Timor to end the violence engulfing that country. In 2006, an Australian Greens senator, Kerry Nettle, called on the health minister, Tony Abbott, to refrain from debating the abortion drug RU486 because he was Catholic. Cardinal George Pell concerned himself publicly with traditional issues of Christian doctrine, such as supporting marriage and opposing abortion, but also raised questions about government policies such as the Work Choices industrial relations reforms and the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.

; Australian Catholic politicians

Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin of the Australian Labor Party in 1929. He was succeeded by Joseph Lyons of the United Australia Party who was prime minister from 1932 to 1939, and remains Australia&#x27;s longest serving Catholic prime minister. The first woman elected to the House of Representatives was his wife, Enid Lyons (United Australia Party), who was a Catholic convert. Australian Catholic women have achieved a number of significant milestones in the history of Australian politics. The first woman to be elected as leader of a state or territory was Catholic Rosemary Follett, who won the first ACT election in 1989. The first woman Premier of NSW was Labor&#x27;s Kristina Keneally, a Catholic with a master&#x27;s degree in Catholic systemic theology. Dame Roma Mitchell, a devout Catholic, served as Governor of South Australia from 1991 to 1996, the first woman to be appointed governor of an Australian state. Dame Roma had also been a Supreme Court Judge, University Chancellor, Human Rights campaigner and advocate for Aboriginal people. Following her death, the ABC reported &quot;Those who were close to Dame Roma Mitchell say her deep Catholic faith guided every aspect of her life, giving her the strength and ambition to campaign for social change and her philosophy of generosity and kindness&quot;.

The Australian Labor Party had largely been supported by Catholics until layman B. A. Santamaria formed the Democratic Labor Party over concerns of Communist influence over the trade union movement in the 1950s. The war-time prime minister, John Curtin (Labor), was raised Catholic. Ben Chifley (Labor) also served as prime minister from 1945 to 1949. In more recent decades, Catholics have led all major parties and served as Prime Ministers and Opposition leader. Labor prime ministers Paul Keating (1991–1996) and Kevin Rudd (2007–2010, 2013) were both raised Catholic (though Rudd now identifies as an Anglican). Tim Fischer was Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party between 1996 and 1999, was a practising Catholic and later served as the Australian Ambassador to the Holy See between 2008 and 2012.

The three Liberal Party Leaders of the Opposition between 2007 and 2013 - Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott - were all Catholics. Abbott brought the Party to office in 2013 and was succeeded by Turnbull as Prime Minister in 2015. As the connection of the conservative parties to Catholicism has increased in recent decades, so the formerly strong connection between Labor and Catholicism has waned. Nevertheless, since losing office in 2013, the Labor Party has been led by Jesuit educated Bill Shorten and the current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who describes himself as a &quot;cultural Catholic&quot;. Shorten, now an Anglican, wrote in his book &quot;The Common Good&quot;, that he is grateful for his Jesuit education and takes inspiration from the invocation of the Jesuit Pedro Arrupe to be &quot;men for others&quot;. Politicians including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and NSW Premier John Fahey studied for the priesthood before politics. Michael Tate served as a minister in the Labor Hawke government and then, after politics, became a Catholic priest.

==Arts and culture==

===Architecture===

Most towns in Australia have at least one Christian church. St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, follows a conventional English cathedral plan, cruciform in shape, with a tower over the crossing of the nave and transepts and twin towers at the west front with impressive stained glass windows. With a length of and a general width of , it is Sydney&#x27;s largest church. Built to a design by William Wardell from a foundation stone laid in 1868, the spires of the cathedral were not finally added until the year 2000. Wardell also worked on the design of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne – among the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Australia. Wardell&#x27;s overall design was in Gothic Revival style, paying tribute to the mediaeval cathedrals of Europe. Largely constructed between 1858 and 1897, the nave was Early English in style, while the remainder of the building is in Decorated Gothic.

Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, has long been known as the &quot;City of Churches&quot;. North of Adelaide is the Jesuit old stone winery and cellars at Sevenhill, founded by Austrian Jesuits in 1848. A rare Australian example of Spanish missionary style exists at New Norcia, Western Australia, founded by Spanish Benedictine monks in 1846. A number of notable Victorian era chapels and edifices were also constructed at church schools across Australia.

Along with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century. St Monica&#x27;s Cathedral in Cairns was designed by architect Ian Ferrier and built in 1967–68 following the form of the original basilica model of the early churches of Rome, adapted to a tropical climate and to reflect the changes to Catholic liturgy mandated at Vatican II. The cathedral was dedicated as a memorial to the Battle of the Coral Sea which was fought east of Cairns in May 1942. The &quot;Peace Window&quot; stained glass was installed on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. In the later 20th century, distinctly Australian approaches were applied at places such as Jamberoo Benedictine Abbey, where natural materials were chosen to &quot;harmonise with the local environment&quot; and the chapel sanctuary is of glass overlooking rainforest. Similar design principles were applied at Thredbo Ecumenical Chapel built in the Snowy Mountains in 1996.

===Film and television===
Australian films on Catholic themes have included:

After accepting an offer to counselling priests, he uncovers a scandal.
*&quot;Sisters of War&quot; (2010) is a telemovie based on the true story of two Australian women, Lorna Whyte, an army nurse and Sister Berenice Twohill, a Catholic nun from New South Wales who survived as prisoners of war in Papua New Guinea during World War II.
* &quot;Brides of Christ&quot; (1991), starring Naomi Watts and guest starring Russell Crowe, was a television miniseries produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Set in a Sydney convent school, it dealt with the struggles of both the nuns and the young students to adapt to the many social changes taking place within the church and the outside world during the 1960s.
* The Abbey (2007), an ABC documentary series filmed in the Jamberoo Benedictine Abbey, followed five women from very different backgrounds and with very different views about spirituality as they lived a 33-day program introduction to monastic living devised and implemented by the nuns.

Coverage of religion is part of the ABC&#x27;s Charter obligation to reflect the character and diversity of the Australian community. Its religious programs include coverage of Catholic (and other) worship and devotion, explanation, analysis, debate and reports. Catholic Church Television Australia is an office with the Australian Catholic Office for Film &amp; Broadcasting and develops television programs for Aurora Community Television on Foxtel and Austar in Australia.

===Literature===
The body of literature produced by Australian Catholics is extensive. During colonial times, the Benedictine missionary William Ullathorne (1806–1889) was a notable essayist writing against the Convict Transportation system. Later Cardinal Moran (1830–1911), a noted historian, wrote a &quot;History of the Catholic Church in Australasia&quot;. More recent Catholic histories of Australia include &quot;The Catholic Church and Community in Australia&quot; (1977) by Patrick O&#x27;Farrell and &quot;Australian Catholics&quot; (1987) by Edmund Campion.

Notable Catholic poets have included Christopher Brennan (1870–1932); James McAuley (1917–1976); Bruce Dawe (1930–2020) and Les Murray (1938–2019). Murray and Dawe were among Australia&#x27;s foremost contemporary poets, noted for their use of vernacular and everyday Australian themes. Emblematic of the Christian poets could be McAuley&#x27;s rejection of Modernism in favour of Classical culture:

:Christ, you walked on a sea
:But you cannot walk in a poem,
:Not in our century.
:There&#x27;s something deeply wrong
:Either with us or with you.

Many Australian writers have examined the lives of Christian characters, or have been influenced by Catholic schooling. Australia&#x27;s best-selling novel of all time, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; by Colleen McCullough, writes of the temptations encountered by a priest living in the Outback. Many contemporary Australian writers have attended or taught at Catholic schools

Catholic news publications have existed since 1839. They currently include: &quot;The Catholic Weekly&quot; from Sydney; &quot;The Catholic Leader&quot;, published by the Brisbane Archdiocese; and &quot;Eureka Street Magazine&quot; which is concerned with public affairs, arts, and theology and is run by the communication division of the Jesuit religious order.

===Music===

St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral Choir, Sydney, is the oldest musical institution in Australia, from origins in 1817. Major Catholic-raised recording artists from Johnny O&#x27;Keefe to Paul Kelly have recorded Christian spirituals. Paul Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Meet Me in the Middle of the Air&quot; is based on Psalm 23. Catholic nun Sister Janet Mead achieved significant mainstream chart success. New South Wales Supreme Court Judge George Palmer was commissioned to compose the setting of the Mass for Sydney&#x27;s World Youth Day 2008 Papal Mass. The Mass, &quot;Benedictus Qui Venit&quot;, for large choir, soloists and orchestra, was performed in the presence of Pope Benedict XVI and an audience of 350,000 with singing led by soprano Amelia Farrugia and tenor Andrew Goodwin. &quot;Receive the Power&quot;, a song written by Guy Sebastian and Gary Pinto, was chosen as the official anthem for the XXIII World Youth Day (WYD08) held in Sydney in 2008.
Australian Christmas carols like the &quot;Three Drovers&quot; or &quot;Christmas Day&quot; by John Wheeler and William G. James place the Christmas story in an Australian context of warm, dry Christmas winds and red dust and are popular at Catholic services. As the festival of Christmas falls during the Australian summer, Australians gather in large numbers for traditional open-air evening carol services and concerts in December, such as Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne and Carols in the Domain in Sydney.

===Art===
The story of Christian art in Australia began with the arrival of the first British settlers at the end of the 18th century. During the 19th century, Gothic Revival cathedrals were built in the colonial capitals, often containing stained glass art works, as can be seen at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, and St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. Roy de Maistre (1894–1968) was an Australian abstract artist who obtained renown in Britain, converted to Catholicism and painted notable religious works, including a series of Stations of the Cross for Westminster Cathedral in London. Among the most acclaimed of Australian painters of Catholic themes was Arthur Boyd. He painted a Biblical series, and created tapestries of the life of St Francis of Assisi. Influenced by both the European masters and the Heidelberg School of Australian landscape art, he placed the central characters of the Bible within Australian bush scenery, as in his portrait of Adam and Eve, &quot;The Expulsion&quot; (1948). The artist Leonard French, who designed a stained glass ceiling of the National Gallery of Victoria, has drawn heavily on Christian story and symbolism through his career.

==Organisation==

Within Australia the church hierarchy is made of metropolitan archdioceses and suffragan sees. Each diocese has a bishop, while each archdiocese is served by an archbishop. Australia has no living members of the College of Cardinals following the death on 10 January 2023 of the previous Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell. The national assembly of bishops is the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference (ACBC), headed by Timothy Costelloe SDB, the Archbishop of Perth. There are a further 175 autonomous Catholic religious orders operating in Australia, generally affiliated under Catholic Religious Australia, headed by Sr Monica Cavanagh RSJ.

The church in Australia has five provinces: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. There are seven archdioceses: Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Goulburn, Hobart, Melbourne and Perth. There are 35 dioceses, comprising geographic areas as well as the Australian Defence Force and dioceses for the Chaldean, Maronite, Melkite and Ukrainian rites. There is also a personal ordinariate, principally for former Anglicans, which has a similar status to a diocese. 
 There is also the Australian vicariate of the international personal prelature of the holy cross and opus dei. Rev Paul Hayward, a member of the canon law society of Great Britain and Ireland published in 2013 a helpful article expanding on the theme of territorial and personal jurisdictions. In May 2024, Pope Francis published a short letter to parish priests throughout the world offering three suggestions, the first beginning; &quot;I ask you first to live out your specific ministerial charism in ever greater service to the varied gifts that the Spirit sows in the People of God. It is urgent to discover with faith, the many and varied charismatic gifts of the laity, be they of a humble or more exalted form...&quot; In 2017, there were an estimated 3,000 priests and 9,000 men and women in institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life.

===Australian Catholic Bishops Conference===
The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference is the national body of the bishops of Australia. The Conference is headed by Perth Archbishop, Timothy Costelloe SDB. It is served by a secretariat, based in Canberra, under the management of the Reverend Brian Lucas. The conference meets at least annually.

Australia&#x27;s autonomous Catholic religious orders are affiliated under Catholic Religious Australia (CRA), which is the public name of the Australian Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes (ACLRI). This is the peak body for leaders of the religious institutes and societies of apostolic life resident in Australia. It represents more than 130 congregations of sisters, brothers and priests. It is established by the authority of the Holy See in Rome and is tasked with promoting, supporting and representing religious life in the Australian church and in the wider community and with facilitating co-ordination and co-operation of religious with church bodies and with other authorities including with episcopal conferences and with individual bishops. The organisation is presently led by Josephite Sister Monica Cavanagh.

<text>Hoppers Crossing is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Wyndham local government area. Hoppers Crossing recorded a population of 37,216 at the 2021 census.

Located on the urban fringe, from the Princes Highway to the growing suburbs of Tarneit and Truganina, Hoppers Crossing stretches northwards.

==History==
Hoppers Crossing is a suburb in the Wyndham area, an area rich and diverse in its Aboriginal history which was inhabited by the Boonwurrung and Wathaurong People who belong to the Kulin Nation. There are five different language groups in the Kulin Nation that are particular to this region.

These groups operated within their own tribal boundaries. However, with the shifting of natural boundaries over the years and the growth of Australia’s population, the old tribal boundaries are not so widely known. The collective traditional territory for the tribes of the Kulin Nation extends around Port Phillip and Western Port, up into the Great Dividing Range and the Loddon and Goulburn River valleys. The clan Kurang-jang-balluk lived east of Werribee River and up to Kororoit Creek. Their name refers to red earth, the colour of the volcanic plains of Iramoo. After the first disruption of British colonisation, the remaining members of the Woiwurrung joined other Kulin language groups at Coranderrk in 1864. This broke cultural protocols that had been tended for many generations. The clan was forcibly displaced again in 1924. In the wider district, there are places named after Aboriginal people or animals. Truganina, for Palawa woman Truganini. Mambourin, a Barrabool man. Balliang (bat), Cocoroc (frog), Parwan (magpie). 

The locality of Hoppers Crossing was named after Elizabeth Hopper, who was a gatekeeper of the level crossing over the railway line now called the Werribee line. Her duty was to close and re-open a set of large wooden level crossing gates whenever a train passed through. She and her husband, Stephen Hopper (1832–1908), a railway ganger for 33 years, lived nearby with their eleven children. Stephen Hopper was also a labourer, who had arrived in Victoria in 1856 from a village in Dover, England. He was then in his early 20s and presumably came for the gold. The name was in common usage by 1910.

Other names in Hoppers Crossing also point to settler history. The roads Heaths, Hogans and Morris are named after farming families. Baden and Powell Drives are named for HL Baden Powell, an ex-shearer who subdivided land for housing in the 1960s. He was a fan of the Richmond Football Club, so many of the streets in this estate are named after players, including Jack Dyer, Frank Hughes and Kevin Bartlett. Until the early 1960s, the locality was mainly open farmland and the only notable feature of Hoppers Crossing was Frank Kopacka&#x27;s general store. In 1963, the first subdivision of residential land took place by former shearer Harold Llewellyn Baden Powell. However, basic infrastructure such as telephones, sewerage and even kerb-side post boxes was only built more than five years later after lobbying from the Hoppers Crossing Ratepayers Association.

Hoppers Crossing grew rapidly from the 1970s. The suburb&#x27;s first primary school, Mossfiel Primary School, had its initial student intake in 1970, the year of opening of the railway station. The first shopping centre, Woodville Park, was built soon afterwards, and the post office opened in 1975.

In the late 1980s, Werribee Plaza first opened its doors. Between 2000 and 2006, it underwent many important redesigns and extensions.

==Transport==
===Rail===

Hoppers Crossing is served by the Hoppers Crossing railway station, to the south of the suburb, on the Werribee line, where the line is crossed by the Old Geelong Road. In the 19th century, railway workers on the line knew the place as &quot;Hopper&#x27;s Hill&quot;, referring to the steep gradient from Skeleton Creek where goods locomotive drivers often had to split their train into two sections to make the grade. When opened in 1970, the station was on the western side of the Old Geelong Road level crossing on the Port Fairy line, served by only a few diesel-hauled trains each day. In 1983, the station was relocated to the eastern side of the level crossing, in conjunction with electrification of the line. The Regional Rail Link opened in 2015, which provided new track from West Werribee through Tarneit to Deer Park and included a new railway station at Tarneit. This connected the Serviceton and Port Fairy railway lines and redirected Geelong V/Line trains away from the Port Fairy line and Hoppers Crossing.

In November 2018, the Victorian Government announced that the level crossing at Old Geelong Road would be removed by closing the existing road and constructing a new road bridge east of the station. The station and precinct would also be rebuilt. The road bridge was opened in December 2021 and the remainder of the project is scheduled for completion in 2022.

In the mid-2000s a tramway was proposed for the Hoppers Crossing – Werribee area to replace bus services, but the idea was not seen as feasible by the Wyndham City Council and Victorian State Government.

===Bus===
Bus services in Hoppers Crossing connect surrounding areas to Hoppers Crossing station, Werribee Plaza, and Werribee. Bus services have been extended as surrounding areas expand.

===Road===
Major roads include the Princes Highway (C109), Heaths Road (C701), Derrimut Road (C702), Hogans Road, Morris Road, Tarneit Road and Sayers Road.

==Sports==

Hoppers Crossing has many gyms and sports grounds. There are facilities for tennis, soccer, Australian rules football, basketball, netball, lawn bowls and more. In 2004, the Federation Trail was opened, which links Werribee with Brooklyn, and soon Yarraville.

A new soccer complex was built at The Grange for the Hoppers Crossing Soccer Club. They previously played at Mossfiel Reserve, which is now a rugby football field. Founded in 1971, the &#x27;Reds&#x27; have won 5 senior championships (1999, 2001, 2012, 2014 and 2015) and will compete in the Football Federation Victoria State League 2 Nth/West division in 2017. One of the most popular clubs in the region, Hoppers Crossing SC currently field 20 teams across junior, senior and masters age groups.

The Hoppers Crossing Football Club, nicknamed the &#x27;Warriors&#x27;, play at Hogans Road Reserve. They currently compete in the Western Region Football League first division, where they won senior premierships in 2002 and 2004. The Warriors are one of the biggest clubs in the league, boasting numerous junior sides as well seniors and reserves.

Hoppers Crossing Cricket Club, known as the &#x27;Cats&#x27; was formed in 1977 and its first team was entered into the &quot;B turf&quot; section of the Sunshine Cricket Association in season 1977/78. The result in the club&#x27;s first season was runners-up.

<text>George Irvin Bamberger (August 1, 1923 – April 4, 2004) was an American professional baseball player, pitching coach and manager. In Major League Baseball, the right-handed pitcher appeared in ten games, nine in relief, for the 1951–52 New York Giants and the 1959 Baltimore Orioles. He later spent ten seasons (1968–77) as the Orioles&#x27; pitching coach and managed the Milwaukee Brewers (1978–80; 1985–86) and New York Mets (1982–83). During his playing career, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

==Playing career==
Bamberger was born and raised in Staten Island, New York City, New York. He served in the United States Army during World War II in the Mediterranean and European theaters of operations and signed with the hometown New York Giants in 1946. Bamberger reached double digits in wins during four of his first five minor league seasons; he would record ten or more victories in 15 of his 18 years as a minor league pitcher, and win 213 total games during that span (1946–63).

Bamberger made the Giants&#x27; 28-man roster at the outset of the season. In his big-league debut on April 19, 1951, during a Patriots&#x27; Day doubleheader against the Boston Braves at Braves Field, he gave up three hits (including a home run to Sam Jethroe) and two earned runs in two innings pitched. Nine days later, he struggled again, as he surrendered a base on balls and then a two-run homer to Jackie Robinson, while recording no outs, against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Bamberger spent the rest of that season with the Triple-A Ottawa Giants of the International League.

In , Bamberger again was a member of the big-league Giants during the season&#x27;s early weeks. He appeared in five more games, all as a relief pitcher, but was largely ineffective, allowing six hits, three walks, and four earned runs in four full innings of work. After June 1, he was sent to the Oakland Oaks of the top-level Pacific Coast League, where he spent the bulk of the rest of his playing career. The Oaks transferred to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1956, and Bamberger remained with the renamed Vancouver Mounties for another seven years until the franchise moved again, to Dallas, Texas, in 1963.

In the midst of that tenure, however, in , the 35-year-old Bamberger received his third and final major league trial with the Mounties&#x27; parent club, the Baltimore Orioles. In his American League debut on April 16, Bamberger was the starting pitcher against the defending World Champion New York Yankees at Memorial Stadium. He held the Yankees scoreless for five full innings, as Baltimore built a 2–0 lead. But in the sixth, he surrendered a two-run double to Norm Siebern, tying the game; and then, after the Orioles had gone ahead 3–2 in their half of the sixth, he gave up the lead in the seventh frame. He left after innings, having allowed four earned runs on four hits, with Baltimore trailing by a run. (The Orioles eventually prevailed, 7–4, with Billy O&#x27;Dell getting the win in relief.)

After two relief appearances with the Orioles, Bamberger returned to the Pacific Coast League for the rest of his pitching career. He never recorded a decision in the Majors, and compiled a 9.42 earned run average with 25 hits and ten bases on balls allowed, and three strikeouts, over innings.

==Coaching and managerial career==

===Baltimore Orioles pitching coach===
In 1960–63, Bamberger served as a player-coach for the Mounties and Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers while still pitching regularly (working in 135 games, 110 as a starter). Then, in 1964, he retired as a player and rejoined the Baltimore organization as its roving minor league pitching instructor. The Orioles&#x27; farm system was then among the pioneers in standardizing player instruction. With Bamberger playing a key role, it was developing a corps of young pitchers that would help the club win the 1966 World Series. 

He earned a promotion when general manager Harry Dalton appointed him to succeed Harry Brecheen as the Orioles&#x27; pitching coach on October 3, 1967. Bamberger took over a pitching staff that often saw young stars quickly lose their effectiveness due to sore arms. Dave McNally and Jim Palmer, two stars who recovered under Bamberger, credited a routine of regular exercises instituted by Bamberger for reversing the trend. 

Serving under Hank Bauer and then Earl Weaver, Bamberger would remain with the ballclub through 1977 and five American League East Division championships, three American League pennants and the 1970 World Series championship. During that decade, he produced 18 twenty-game winners, including four for the 1971 American League champions: Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar, Dave McNally and Pat Dobson. He also would teach his famed pitch, &quot;The Staten Island Sinker&quot;.

===1978–80: Manager of &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Bombers&quot; in Milwaukee===
Bamberger signed a two-year $120,000 contract to succeed Alex Grammas as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers on January 20, 1978. The appointment reunited him with Dalton, who had become the Brewers&#x27; new general manager two months earlier. Dalton said Bamberger “was the only man we considered” for the position. The Milwaukee franchise never had a winning record in its first nine seasons, prior to Bamberger&#x27;s arrival. Stating that a major goal was instilling a winning attitude, he added, &quot;Last year the feeling I got was that we (the Orioles) should not lose to the Milwaukee Brewers. We felt they did not care, that they felt we were going to win.&quot;

In his first managerial assignment, Bamberger led the 1978 Brewers to a 26-game turnaround. His club won 93 games and finished third behind the Yankees and Boston Red Sox in the AL East. Bamberger&#x27;s influence on his pitching staff was reflected by a 30 percent decrease in walks allowed (566 vs. 398) and a 20 percent decline in home runs allowed (136 vs. 109). Team ERA dropped from 4.32 to 3.65, and both Mike Caldwell (22–9, 2.36) and Lary Sorensen (18–12, 3.21) enjoyed standout seasons. But a spike in offense would make an even larger mark on Bamberger&#x27;s team. The 1978 Brewers hit 173 home runs (48 more than in 1977) and outscored their previous year&#x27;s team by 165 runs, a 26 percent rise. Seven players hit double figures in home runs, and two (Larry Hisle, signed as a free agent, and Gorman Thomas) eclipsed the 30-homer mark. The Brewers became known as &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Bombers.&quot;

Then, in , Bamberger&#x27;s Brewers hit 185 home runs, captured 95 victories and finished second, behind only Weaver&#x27;s Orioles. However, in March 1980 during spring training, Bamberger was hospitalized with back and chest pains. He was diagnosed with a heart attack, underwent surgery and was sidelined until June 6. He re-took the reins from interim pilot Buck Rodgers, but did not finish the season, resigning on September 7 after compiling a disappointing 47–45 win–loss record. He stepped down with a 235–180 (.566) mark for his maiden managerial job, while turning Milwaukee into a contender for the American League pennant. The Brewers qualified for the playoffs in under Rodgers and won their only AL championship in with Harvey Kuenn at the helm. (The club moved to the National League Central Division in .)

===1982–83: Struggles during Mets&#x27; rebuilding===
Frank Cashen, another former Oriole executive, hired Bamberger as manager of the struggling New York Mets for . The Mets had gone only 41–62 (.398) under Joe Torre during the strike-shortened season. The 1982 Mets—still in the early stages of a rebuilding process that would produce the 1986 world championship—played at almost an identical pace (.401), led the National League in bases on balls and finished second-worst in team ERA. Then the 1983 edition started even worse. They were 16–30 (.348) on June 3 when Bamberger resigned, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve probably suffered enough.&quot;

===1985–86: Second term in Milwaukee===
A season and a half later, during the 1984–85 off-season, Dalton called Bamberger back into harness to attempt to revive the Brewers, who had plunged into the AL East basement in . But this time, Bamberger was unable to turn the club around: they won only 71 games for him in (with the team ERA climbing by 0.33 to 4.39) and 71 more the following season. The bright spot on the Brewers&#x27; staff was left-handed starting pitcher Teddy Higuera, who won 15 games as a rookie in 1985 and 20 more the following season. Bamberger retired for a final time September 25, 1986, at age 63, turning the Brewers over to coach Tom Trebelhorn with nine games left in the season. He finished his managerial career with a record of 458–478 (.489).

George Bamberger died on April 4, 2004, from cancer at his home in North Redington Beach, Florida. He was 80 years old.
