<text>Catalina Sky Survey (CSS; obs. code: 703) is an astronomical survey to discover comets and asteroids. It is conducted at the Steward Observatory&#x27;s Catalina Station, located near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.

CSS focuses on the search for near-Earth objects, in particular on any potentially hazardous asteroid that may pose a threat of impact. Its counterpart in the southern hemisphere was the Siding Spring Survey (SSS), closed in 2013 due to loss of funding. CSS supersedes the photographic Bigelow Sky Survey.

== Mission ==
The NEO Observations Program is a result of a United States 1998 congressional directive to NASA to begin a program to identify objects or larger to a confidence level of 90% or better. The Catalina Sky Survey, located at the Mount Lemmon Observatory in the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, carries out searches for near-earth objects (NEOs), contributing to the congressionally-mandated goal.

In addition to identifying impact risks, the project also obtains other scientific information, including: improving the known population distribution in the main belt, finding the cometary distribution at larger perihelion distances, determining the distribution of NEOs as a product of collisional history and transport to the inner Solar System, and identifying potential targets for flight projects.

== Techniques ==
The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) uses three telescopes, a f/1.6 telescope on the peak of Mount Lemmon (MPC code G96), a f/1.7 Schmidt telescope near Mount Bigelow (MPC code 703), and a f/2.6 follow-up telescope also on Mount Lemmon (MPC code I52). The three telescopes are located in the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, Arizona. The CSS southern hemisphere counterpart, the Siding Spring Survey (SSS), used a f/3 Uppsala Schmidt telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The 1.5-meter and 68-cm survey telescopes use identical, thermo-electrically cooled cameras and common software written by the CSS team. The cameras are cooled to approximately so their dark current is about 1 electron per hour. These 10,560×10,560-pixel cameras provide a field of view of 5 square degrees with the 1.5-m telescope and nearly 20 square degrees with the Catalina Schmidt. Nominal exposures are 30 seconds and the 1.5-m can reach objects fainter than 21.5 V in that time. The 1-meter follow-up telescope uses a 2000×2000-pixel CCD detector which provides a field of view of 0.3 square degrees. Starting in 2019, CSS started using the Kuiper telescope situated on Mt. Bigelow for targeted follow-up for 7–12 nights per lunation.

CSS typically operates every clear night with the exception of a few nights centered on the full moon. The southern hemispheres&#x27; SSS in Australia ended in 2013 after funding was discontinued.

== Discoveries ==

In 2005, CSS became the most prolific NEO survey, surpassing Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) in total number of NEOs and potentially hazardous asteroids discovered each year since. As of 2020, the Catalina Sky Survey is responsible for the discovery of 47% of the total known NEO population.

== Educational outreach ==
The CSS has helped with Astronomy Camp by showing campers how they detect NEOs. They even played a role in an astrophotography exercise with the 2006 Adult Astronomy Camp ending up with a picture that was featured on Astronomy Picture of the Day.

=== Catalina Outer Solar System Survey ===
The Zooniverse project Catalina Outer Solar System Survey is a citizen science project and is listed as a NASA citizen science project. In this project, the volunteers search for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in pre-processed images of the Catalina Sky Survey. Computers can detect the motion of TNOs, but humans must check whether this motion is real. Upon agreement with the volunteers, they will be cited as &quot;measurers&quot; in the submission of the astrometry to the Minor Planet Center. The project already found previously known TNOs, including 47171 Lempo, , and .

<text>1962–1966, also known as the Red Album, is a compilation album of songs by the English rock band the Beatles, spanning the years indicated in the title. Released with its counterpart &quot;1967–1970&quot; (the &quot;Blue Album&quot;) in 1973, the double LP peaked at number 3 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it topped the &quot;Cash Box&quot; albums chart and peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart while &quot;1967–1970&quot; reached the top spot. The album was re-released in September 1993 on compact disc, charting at number 3 in the UK.

The album was instigated by Apple Records manager Allen Klein shortly before he was dismissed from his position. Even though the group had success with cover versions of songs, particularly &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;1962–1966&quot; contains only songs composed by the Beatles. The album omits any George Harrison compositions from the era, such as &quot;Taxman&quot;, as the content is entirely Lennon–McCartney originals.

As with &quot;1967–1970&quot;, the compilation was created by Apple and EMI/Capitol Records in response to a bootleg collection titled &quot;Alpha Omega&quot;, which had been sold on television the previous year. Print advertising for the two records made a point of declaring them &quot;the only collection of the Beatles&quot;. The success of the two official double LP compilations inspired Capitol&#x27;s repackaging of the Beach Boys&#x27; 1960s hits, starting with the 1974 album &quot;Endless Summer&quot;.

A deluxe expanded version of the album was released on November 10, 2023, containing new remixes of a majority of the tracks and additional tracks not previously included in the original release.

== Album covers ==
For the group&#x27;s 1963 debut LP &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, photographer Angus McBean took the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House (EMI&#x27;s London headquarters in Manchester Square, demolished in 1995). The cover for the 1963 EP &quot;The Beatles (No. 1)&quot; used a picture from the same shoot.

In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although one of the 1969 photographs was originally intended for the planned &quot;Get Back&quot; album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Instead, another 1969 photograph, along with an unused one from the 1963 photo shoot, were used for both this LP and the cover of &quot;1967–1970&quot;.

The inner gatefold photo for both LPs has been attributed to both Stephen Goldblatt and Don McCullin, and is from the &quot;Mad Day Out&quot; photo session in London on Sunday 28 July 1968.

The album cover was designed by Tom Wilkes.

== Release variations ==
* Original 1973 UK release: Apple PCSP 7171-2
* Original 1973 US release: Apple SKBO-3403 (whole and sliced apples on red background)
* Second 1976 US pressings: Capitol SKBO-3403 (Capitol target logo on back of album cover, red labels with &quot;Capitol&quot; in light red at bottom. There are also copies erroneously pressed with the BLUE labels for the 1967–1970 pressings.)
* 1978 first US red vinyl issue: Capitol SEBX-11842 (Capitol dome logo on back of album cover, large dome logo at top of labels)

The British and American versions of the vinyl album contain notable differences; for example, &quot;Help!&quot; on the American edition includes the same pseudo-James Bond intro as found on the American &quot;Help!&quot; soundtrack LP, while the same song on the British edition does not. Also, the British LP uses the stereo &quot;whispering intro&quot; mix of &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, while the U.S. LP uses the mono mix from &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;, which is drenched in additional reverb. In the liner notes associating the songs with their original albums, the U.S. editions referenced the Capitol albums while the UK editions used the British albums.

The first compact disc version was released on 20 September 1993. It was released on two discs for the price of two albums, though it could have fit onto a single disc; EMI stated that this was done to match the release of &quot;1967–1970&quot;. The CD version used new digital masters. The first four tracks on the CD release are in mono; the rest of the tracks are in stereo. The tracks &quot;All My Loving&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; made their CD stereo debut with this release. 
The 1993 versions were also issued on vinyl in the UK.

=== 2010 remastered version ===
EMI announced on 10 August 2010, that the album had been remastered for a second time and, once again, would be released as a two-CD package. The album was released worldwide on 18 October 2010, and 19 October 2010 in North America.

=== 2014 mastered vinyl ===
The album was reissued on 180g vinyl in 2014, prepared from the original UK 1973 compilation master. The fake stereo mixes of the Andy White version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (with Starr on tambourine) and &quot;She Loves You&quot; were replaced by the true mono versions, but while the Side 1 label indicated “Please Please Me” and “From Me To You” being mono, they were, in fact, the stereo versions.

=== 2023 remixed editions ===
The compilation, along with its counterpart, was rereleased with an expanded track listing on 10 November 2023.

The 12 additional tracks are: &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;This Boy&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. Additionally, the version of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; with Ringo Starr on drums, originally issued only on first pressings of the 1962 UK single, replaced the version with Andy White on drums and Starr on tambourine formerly used for this compilation.

Thirty out of the 38 songs on the album received a new stereo mix, while the remaining eight used mixes from the 2022 &quot;&quot; set. The album is also available in Dolby Atmos surround sound. On the CD and digital editions, the additional tracks are inserted into the track list in chronological order of each track&#x27;s original issue, while on the vinyl edition, the first two LPs retain the track list of the 1973 release, with the additional tracks placed on a third LP.

A press conference for the release, along with &quot;Now and Then&quot;, was held at the Dolby Screening Room in New York City on 27 September, 2023. Tracks from the release were played in the theatre in their newly mixed form.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the original red and blue albums &quot;eight of the most-perfect album sides ever devised&quot; and said that the bonus discs &quot;fix the holes in the originals&quot;, noting the addition of songs written by Harrison, cover songs and more tracks from &quot;Revolver&quot;. They said tracks in the compilation &quot;have never thundered like this before&quot;. Giles Martin, who mixed the new versions, said of the new mixes, &quot;I never thought it would happen&quot;, as Martin has been credited for stating the early recordings were impossible to work with this kind of mix. He said in an interview, &quot;Technically, on the early tracks, it&#x27;s completely mind-blowing to me how we made them sound. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for us to do that to the early tracks. As I&#x27;ve told you, I didn&#x27;t think that we could do the work we&#x27;ve done on things like &#x27;I Saw Her Standing There&#x27; or &#x27;All My Loving&#x27; or &#x27;Twist and Shout.&#x27; The power of Ringo&#x27;s drumming, for example, on those early tracks, it&#x27;s been unearthed. But the playing is just &quot;really&quot; good. That&#x27;s joy.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; called the new mixes &quot;extraordinary&quot;, and that, on the Red Album particularly, they &quot;sound so fresh it could be by some up-and-coming garage rock band&quot;. They also quoted Martin &quot;rejecting the cynicism some people have about reissues&quot;. &quot;Salon.com&quot; said the tracks &quot;came roaring to life with previously unrealised dimensions&quot;, and praised the separation of the tracks. For example, they said the mix of bonus track &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; allows the Beatles to be heard &quot;in splendid isolation, all working in the stead of a time-eclipsing song&quot;. Tidal Magazine added, &quot;the 2023 revisions are sequenced not like LPs but like playlists, allowing for slight digressions and offering a more immersive experience. It&#x27;s not quite the same vibe as the original records, yet these 50th-anniversary reissues do hearken back to the origins of the Red and Blue Albums.&quot; They also added that &quot;they repurpose the Beatles to suit the habits of streaming listeners — just like how the originals were designed with an LP audience in mind.&quot;

On 3 November 2023, the 2023 mix of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was released alongside &quot;Now and Then&quot;.

== Track listing ==
* Although it appeared on the Vee-Jay compilation &quot;Jolly What! The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage&quot;, this is the first appearance of &quot;From Me to You&quot; on a U.S. Capitol album.
* &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; also makes its U.S. Capitol album debut here, having previously only appeared on the United Artists soundtrack album of the film of the same name.


All tracks are written by Lennon-McCartney, except where noted.

<text>Coffin birth, also known as postmortem fetal extrusion, is the expulsion of a nonviable fetus through the vaginal opening of the decomposing body of a deceased pregnant woman due to increasing pressure from intra-abdominal gases. This kind of postmortem delivery occurs very rarely during the decomposition of a body. The practice of chemical preservation, whereby chemical preservatives and disinfectant solutions are pumped into a body to replace natural body fluids (and the bacteria that reside therein), have made the occurrence of &quot;coffin birth&quot; so rare that the topic is rarely mentioned in international medical discourse.

Typically during the decomposition of a human body, naturally occurring bacteria in the organs of the abdominal cavity (such as the stomach and intestines) generate gases as by-products of metabolism, which causes the body to swell. In some cases, the confined pressure of the gases can squeeze the uterus (the womb), even forcing it downward, and it may and be forced out of the body through the vaginal opening (a process called &quot;prolapse&quot;). If a fetus is contained within the uterus, it could therefore be expelled from the mother&#x27;s body through the vaginal opening when the uterus turns inside-out, in a process that, to outward appearances, mimics childbirth. The main differences lie in the state of the mother and fetus and the mechanism of delivery: in the event of natural, live childbirth, the mother&#x27;s contractions thin and widen the cervix to expel the infant from the womb; in a case of coffin birth, built-up gas pressure within the putrefied body of a pregnant woman pushes the dead fetus from the body of the mother.

Cases have been recorded by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when the body of a pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.

==Causes==

The cause of postmortem fetal extrusion is not completely understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While it is possible that more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.

Typically, as a dead body decomposes, body tissues become depleted of oxygen and the body begins to putrefy; anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased metabolic activity, release gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. These bacteria secrete exoenzymes to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues. Increasing pressure forces the diffusion of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the circulatory system and spread to other parts of the body, causing both torso and limbs to become bloated. These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers. Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death, depending on external temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions. As the volume of gas increases, the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices. It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated, and intra-abdominal gas pressure may force the and prolapse of the uterus, which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal. It has been observed that the bodies of multiparous women are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy, because of the more elastic nature of the cervix.

==History==
Numerous documented cases of postmortem fetal extrusion were described in the medical compendium &quot;Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine&quot;, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the short amount of time elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later a fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred before burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.

During the late 19th century, modern embalming techniques were developed, whereby preservative and disinfectant chemical compounds (such as formaldehyde) are pumped into a body, flushing out the body&#x27;s natural fluids, and with them the bacteria that flourish during putrefaction and generate the gases that comprise the active force behind the expulsion of the fetus. However, the phenomenon was still recognized by medical science and in 1904, John Whitridge Williams wrote a textbook on obstetric medicine that included a section on &quot;coffin birth&quot;. Although the text has remained an important reference in obstetrics, the subject, whether called &quot;coffin birth&quot; or &quot;postmortem fetal extrusion&quot;, was excluded by its 13th edition in 1966, and was not mentioned in the edition published in 2009. The subject was discussed in German medical literature during the 20th century, though more detailed case reports in the forensic literature have been published recently.

In 2005, the body of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was discovered in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, it was found that the head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as it was the first modern case in which medical practitioners were able to document a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress.

In 2008, the body of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was discovered in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman&#x27;s undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus. This was the first forensic case in which it could be concluded that coffin birth had occurred based on the position of the bodies and the clear attachment of the umbilical cord to the un-expelled placenta.

In 2019, the autopsy reports in the case of the Watts family homicides in August 2018 revealed that Shanann Watts (who had been 15 weeks pregnant at the time of her murder) had been found in a shallow grave and that the fetus had been expelled from her body, along with the placenta and umbilical cord.

===Bioarchaeology===
Postmortem fetal extrusion can be very difficult to recognize once a body has undergone complete skeletonization, and bioarchaeologists are often very cautious about asserting the presence of this phenomenon. There are numerous cultural reasons why a mother and an infant might be interred together, so the joint presence of neonatal remains and an adult female is not taken as conclusive evidence of postmortem fetal extrusion; however, there have been excavated burials where the position of a set of fetal remains relative to those of an adult female supported this hypothesis. There are a few general guidelines when an archaeologist is assessing the placement of the fetus and the adult:
# If the fetal remains are found in a fetal position and are wholly within the pelvic cavity of the adult, the fetus died and was interred before delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.
# If the infant is found alongside the adult, with the head oriented in the same direction as the adult, then the infant was delivered, whether naturally or by caesarian incision, around the time of death, and thereafter interred.
## Delivered infants have also been interred between or alongside the tibiae (shins), but the infant is still oriented in the same direction as the adult.
## If the majority of the fetal remains are in the pelvic cavity of the adult, yet the legs are extended and/or the cranium lies among the ribs, then the infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of the mother&#x27;s torso before burial. As both bodies skeletonized, the infant&#x27;s bones would have settled among the mother&#x27;s ribs and vertebrae.
# If the fetal remains are complete and in a position inferior to and in-line with the pelvic outlet, with the head oriented opposite to that of the mother (toward the foot of the coffin or grave), then there is the possibility of coffin birth.
## Evidence for postmortem fetal extrusion may be less ambiguous when the fetal remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet of the adult, thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.

In 1975, it was reported that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show &quot;History Cold Case&quot;, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.

==Applicability of diagnosis==
Because postmortem fetal extrusion is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions regarding the individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.

In archaeology, the study of mortuary context, that is, the interpretation of the postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has led to the development of hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred before death has a bearing on analyses of the mother&#x27;s population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.

==Comparable phenomena==
There are also many cases where the remains of the fetus are found separate from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.

In April 2003, the body of Laci Peterson washed up on a shore near San Francisco Bay; she had been pregnant when she disappeared four months earlier, and the fetus she had been carrying was discovered on a separate beach. When questioned by the media, medical authorities initially speculated that a &quot;coffin birth&quot; might have occurred. However, at autopsy the cervix was found to be in a prepartum condition. Medical examiners later concluded that while Peterson&#x27;s body was in the bay, the skin over the abdominal cavity had ruptured due to natural decompositional processes. Seawater entered the abdominal cavity and washed out most of the internal organs, along with the fetus.

In 2007, a 23-year-old woman in India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously delivered unassisted from the woman&#x27;s body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant was found on the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun before death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of &quot;postmortem delivery&quot;, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.

In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old woman in her third trimester was involved in a motor vehicle accident and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact. The woman died of blunt trauma, and her body burned in the car. Investigators came to the conclusion that the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman&#x27;s feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother&#x27;s body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.

==In animals==
Whales can be subject to postmortem fetal extrusion. Many species float when dead, due to the gases of putrefaction. Drift whales that wash up on shore, and the carcasses of hunted whales, if not flensed (stripped of blubber) and processed in a timely manner, pose a risk. Tim Flannery wrote that &quot;A rotting whale could fill with gas to bursting, ejecting a fetus the size of a motor vehicle with sufficient force to kill a man.&quot;

<text>The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya () is a motorsport race track in Montmeló, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. With long straights and a variety of corners, the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is seen as an all-rounder circuit. The track has stands with a capacity of 140,700. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.

Until 2013 the track was known only as the &quot;Circuit de Catalunya&quot;, before a sponsorship deal with Barcelona City Council added Barcelona to the track&#x27;s title.

==History==

The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built in 1991 and began hosting the Spanish Grand Prix that same year. Construction also coincided with the Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Barcelona the next year, where the circuit acted as the start and finish line for the road team time trial cycling event. The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya should not be confused with the Montjuïc circuit, which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975 and, unlike the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, is actually located within the city of Barcelona.

Because so much testing is done at this circuit, Formula One drivers and mechanics are extremely familiar with it. This has led to criticism that drivers and mechanics are too familiar with Catalunya, reducing the amount of on-track action.

When first used, overtaking was frequent as cars could follow closely through the last two corners and slipstream down the long straight. As aerodynamic balance became more critical, this overtaking method drastically decreased as the cars were unable to follow each other through the fast final corner due to turbulence created by the leading car. The 2007 season saw the first of the two final sweepers replaced with a slow chicane to reduce speeds through the final corner, where serious accidents could occur, and in an effort to improve overtaking. However, it has been criticised for failing to achieve the latter aim and for causing congestion during qualifying sessions. The 2022 race was, until now, the last Formula One race to use the chicane, with the original configuration restored ahead of the 2023 race.

The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya has hosted a motorcycle Grand Prix since 1992, originally the European motorcycle Grand Prix from 1992 and later the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix since 1996, and hosted two rounds in 2024, with the season-ending one-off Barcelona motorcycle Grand Prix replacing Valencia because of flooding in the Valencia area. There are at least five points on the track (turns 1–2, 4, 5, 10, 14) where riders are known to overtake. As in Formula 1, Turn 1 is arguably the most popular place for overtaking. The circuit is not known to produce copious amounts of overtaking, despite the long straights. Originally, the Formula 1 circuit changes were not instituted for MotoGP; however, after a fatal crash in the 2016 MotoGP round involving a Moto2 rider, Luis Salom, the Formula 1 layout was implemented to slow down riders for safety purposes. The FIM made a further change to the chicane for 2017 by moving up the chicane to prevent riders from cutting the pit lane entrance, but that was abandoned because the motorcycle chicane had a surface change that created more safety issues with the transition. Further changes were made to the circuit in December 2017 as grandstands were removed to add additional runoff that allowed the FIM to eliminate that chicane (although the Turn 10 hairpin was kept).

The track was resurfaced in 2018 as a result of calls by MotoGP riders to improve the amount of grip on the surface. Previously the track had been resurfaced in 2004.

The circuit hosted many other international racing series, including the FIA Sportscar Championship (1999–2002), European Touring Car Championship (2003), FIA GT Championship (2003), Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (2006–2009), European Le Mans Series (2008–2009, 2019, 2021–present), and World Series Formula V8 3.5 (2002–2004, 2006–2013, 2016), GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup (2017–present), 24h de Barcelona Trofeu Fermí Vélez, and FIA World Rallycross Championship (2015–present).

Since 2016, the racetrack hosts the 24h BiCircuit Festival, an ultra-distance cycling event featuring 24-hour, 12-hour and 6-hour races for soloists and relay teams up to 8 riders.

For the 2020 Formula One season Liberty Media expected the calendar would consist of twenty-one Grands Prix and that any new races would come at the expense of existing events, in particular the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort replacing the Spanish Grand Prix on Circuit de Barcelona, but later negotiated an agreement with the teams to allow up to twenty-two Grands Prix, salvaging the Spanish Grand Prix. Before 2021 season, the circuit&#x27;s F1 deal was extended for one more year. However, in November 2021, the circuit&#x27;s F1 deal was extended to 2026, with 2025 as the last year the Spanish Grand Prix will be held here; a new circuit in Madrid built around the IFEMA grounds would be its home from 2026 onwards.

Barcelona has the 3-star FIA Environmental Accreditation and the ISO 14001 certification. In a 2021 report, it was ranked the second most sustainable racetrack in the world, together with Circuit Paul Ricard and behind Mugello Circuit.

==Racing history==
The circuit has been the site of some memorable moments. In 1991, Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell went down the entire front straight side by side while dueling for second place, with Mansell eventually taking the position and ultimately the race itself. In 1994, Michael Schumacher managed to finish in second place despite driving over half the race with only fifth gear. In 1996, Schumacher took his first win as a Ferrari driver, after a dominant performance during a torrential rainstorm. In 2001, Mika Häkkinen suffered a clutch failure while leading the race on the last lap, handing the win to Schumacher. At the 2006 event, Fernando Alonso became the first Spanish Formula One driver to win at his home country&#x27;s track. In 2016, a crash at turn four took Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg out, allowing Red Bull&#x27;s Max Verstappen to win the race on his first race for the team. Doing so, Verstappen was the youngest to win a race, the youngest driver to stand on the podium, and the youngest to lead a lap of a race, in addition to being the first Dutchman to win a Formula One race.

In 2008, Heikki Kovalainen left the track at after a wheel rim failure at turn 9. He managed to decelerate to when he hit the tyre barrier. He was temporarily unconscious and suffered a minor concussion, but a few minutes later, spectators were relieved when he gave a thumbs up.

The circuit has been the scene of two debut wins in Formula One. Pastor Maldonado took his first and only Grand Prix victory and podium here in 2012, and in 2016 Max Verstappen won his first Grand Prix. As a result, he became the youngest driver to ever win an F1 Grand Prix race.

At the 2009 motorcycle Grand Prix, teammates Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo fought all race long for first place, culminating in an overtake on the final corner by Rossi. Riders and pundits described the race as &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;genius&quot;.

On 3 June 2016, during Moto2 Free Practice for the 2016 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, Luis Salom crashed in turn 12, resulting in the session being red-flagged. After being transferred to the local &quot;Hospital General de Catalunya&quot;, Salom died of the injuries sustained in the crash. Upon hearing this, FIM decided to change the current layout of the track to the same layout as the one used in Formula One. After off-season discussions, the FIM announced that the track layout would be slightly modified in that the chicane would be moved up a few metres.

==Layout==


The track is demanding of a car&#x27;s aerodynamic qualities. The wind direction at the circuit can change drastically during the day, a significant factor given the importance of aerodynamics to modern Formula One cars. It is then difficult to find a good setup since cars can have massive aerodynamic drag and understeer on one part of the circuit in the morning, but suffer oversteer at the same part of the circuit in the afternoon. A given tyre compound can work well when tested, but not so well a couple of months later. These changeable conditions can make for unexpected performances from some teams during the race. The changeable wind conditions have also caused accidents at the circuit, with Fernando Alonso&#x27;s testing accident in 2015 partly blamed on the severity of the wind.

Through 2015, the MotoGP layout used the 1995–2003 version of the Grand Prix circuit. This was originally the same layout as Formula One, but in 2004 a new, slower La Caixa turn was built; the motorcycles continued to use the old version, and they also ignored the shorter Europcar turn and RACC chicane. The F1 layout was implemented for MotoGP originally in 2016 following the fatal accident of Luis Salom in Europcar corner on 3 June 2016. Race control switched to the F1 circuit for qualifying and the race on 5 June 2016. On 15 December 2016, the FIM announced the change was permanent by announcing plans for a chicane ahead of the current car chicane. However, during the 2017 race, the new chicane was deemed dangerous by riders because of a surface change, and the car chicane was used during that event. After changes to the track in the off-season including removing grandstands in Turn 12, creating additional runoff and a complete repaving of the circuit, the F1 layout from 2004 to 2006, including the new La Caixa hairpin instead of the long sweeper, was used, eliminating the chicane.

For 2021, the La Caixa hairpin was remodelled again, slower than the original one but faster than the F1 one. The alterations were done to improve safety for the drivers.

The World RX of Catalunya used parts of the track near turns 11–15, with two additional gravel sections.

From the 2023 Spanish Grand Prix, Formula One will use the layout used by MotoGP since 2021 removing the chicane in the last sector of the lap that Formula One had used every year since it was introduced in 2007 reverting the final corners for Formula One cars to a sweeping fast configuration that Formula One last used in 2006.

===A lap in a Formula One car===
A long pit straight leads them into turn 1 which is the main overtaking point at Catalunya, as it is a braking zone at the end of a long DRS straight. The inside and outside are equally difficult for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two. The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane – drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible. Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve. Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza&#x27;s Curva Parabolica – drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying great speed out of the exit. Turn 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars. Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane. Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars&#x27; suspensions. Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely blind (drivers cannot see the apex on approach). It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf. The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a third-gear, left-hand corner, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right. Turn 13 and 14, a very fast, sixth-gear double right-hander which takes cars across the start/finish line.

==Lap records==

As of November 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya are listed as:

== Financial problems ==
The public attendance at the Spanish Grand Prix, and at the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, have fallen significantly since 2007, which has complicated the economic solvency of this circuit.

At least since 2009, the circuit is economically deficient, and in the period 2009–2018, €50.5m of losses were generated. The economic survival of the circuit is only guaranteed by large volumes of public money, which both the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona and the Generalitat de Catalunya provide in the form of grants and rinsing of losses.

Given these poor results, some senior officials of the Generalitat de Catalunya have considered eliminating Formula One from this Circuit. Due to the irregularities detected in the last audit, the City Council of Barcelona decided to cancel the economic grant that the circuit received until now, which has aggravated its economic survival. Recently, some more irregularities have been detected, even by the Generalitat de Catalunya.

== Noise pollution ==
The circuit is located in an elevated area with respect to its environment, and without protective measures to minimize the noise pollution produced by cars, motorbikes and other vehicles. Therefore, it is a real source of acoustic disturbance, and the noise produced during many days of racing and testing during the year is noticeable for many kilometers around the circuit, especially in the adjacent municipalities, which is recognized by the Generalitat itself, the main owner of the Circuit.

<text>The Official Ninja Webpage: Real Ultimate Power is a satire website created in 2002 by the pseudonymous Robert Hamburger. Written using the persona of a 13-year-old boy, the site is a parody of adolescent fascination with Ninjas. Warren St. John, columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a satirical ode to the masculine prowess of ninjas&quot;.

In 2004, it was chosen by Kensington Books for their inaugural book release in the new fratire genre—non-fiction literature marketed to young men in a politically incorrect and overtly masculine fashion. Due to the website&#x27;s fan base, the &quot;Real Ultimate Power, The Official Ninja Book&quot; became a cult hit, selling 35,000 copies in two years. The success of the book prompted Kensington&#x27;s release of other fratire books by Tucker Max and Maddox.

The Real Ultimate Power concept developed an internet meme with the creation of dozens of imitation parody websites.

==Website==
The Real Ultimate Power website is written under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Hamburger,&quot; who was described in 2006 as a Michigan writer in his 20s. The author has declined to be identified, stating that it would diminish the satirical concept of the fictional pre-adolescent boy.

The homepage describes ninjas through three &quot;facts&quot;: Number one, Ninjas are mammals; Number two, Ninjas fight all the time; and Number three, the purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people. The three facts became an internet meme which spawned numerous imitation Real Ultimate Power websites dedicated, for example, to Conan O&#x27;Brien, liquor store clerks, wizards, and sorority girls.

Other content on the website includes &quot;pump-up&quot; movie scripts and short stories about ninjas. One frequent theme titled &quot;Ninjas versus Pirates&quot; is commonly referenced in video games and other mainstream media. There is a photograph gallery with fan-submitted images, links to other Ninja-related sites, and a forum.

A popular feature is the Hate Mail section. For example, one letter disputed the site&#x27;s claim to have seen a real ninja on the grounds that &quot;there are less than 50 real ones left, and only 5 live in the US&quot;. Regarding the authenticity of the hate mail, the author said that some of the hate email is written by him, while others, such as the ones from an apparent real ninja signed Soke D. Fujita, were authentic.

==Book==
&quot;Real Ultimate Power, The Official Ninja Book&quot; () was published on July 1, 2004, by Citadel. The book was rejected by 11 publishers before being chosen by Kensington Books, the parent company of Citadel. According to Nielsen BookScan, 35,000 copies were sold by 2006. In 2008 a sequel was released, titled &quot;Ghosts/Aliens&quot;.

<text>The Luxembourg Palace (, ) is at 15 Rue de Vaugirard in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, France. It was originally built (1615–1645) to the designs of the French architect Salomon de Brosse to be the royal residence of the regent Marie de&#x27; Medici, mother of King Louis XIII. After the Revolution it was refashioned (1799–1805) by Jean Chalgrin into a legislative building and subsequently greatly enlarged and remodeled (1835–1856) by Alphonse de Gisors. The palace has been the seat of the upper houses of the various French national legislatures (excepting only the unicameral National Assembly of the Second Republic) since the establishment of the during the Consulate; as such, it has been home to the Senate of the Fifth Republic since its establishment in 1958.

Immediately west of the palace on the Rue de Vaugirard is the Petit Luxembourg, now the residence of the Senate President; and slightly further west, the Musée du Luxembourg, in the former orangery. On the south side of the palace, the formal Luxembourg Garden presents a green parterre of gravel and lawn populated with statues and large basins of water where children sail model boats.

==History==
===Palace as royal residence===
After the death of Henry IV in 1610, his widow, Marie de&#x27; Medici, became regent to her son, Louis XIII. Having acceded to a much more powerful position, she decided to erect a new palace for herself, adjacent to an old &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; owned by François de Luxembourg, Duc de Piney, which is now called the Petit Luxembourg and is the residence of the president of the French Senate.

Marie de&#x27; Medici desired to make a building similar to her native Florence&#x27;s Palazzo Pitti; to this effect she had the architect Métezeau (either Louis Métezeau or his brother, Clément Métezeau) sent to Florence to make detailed drawings of the building.

She bought the Hôtel de Luxembourg and its fairly extensive domain in 1612 and commissioned the new building, which she referred to as her &quot;Palais Médicis&quot;, in 1615. Its construction and furnishing formed her major artistic project, though nothing remains today of the interiors as they were created for her, save some architectural fragments reassembled in the &quot;Salle du Livre d&#x27;Or&quot;. The suites of paintings she commissioned, in the subjects of which she expressed her requirements through her agents and advisers, are scattered among museums.

De&#x27; Medici installed her household in 1625, while work on interiors continued. The apartments in the right wing on the western side were reserved for the Queen and the matching suite to the east, for her son, Louis XIII, when he was visiting (&quot;floor plan&quot;). The 24 Marie de&#x27; Medici cycle canvases, a series commissioned from Peter Paul Rubens, were installed in the &quot;Galerie de Rubens&quot; on the main floor of the western wing. These paintings were executed between 1622 and 1625 and depicts Marie&#x27;s struggles and triumphs in life. They are now visible in the Galerie Medicis of the Louvre, one of the treasures of the museum&#x27;s Flemish paintings department. A series of paintings executed for her &quot;Cabinet doré&quot; (&quot;gilded study&quot;) was identified by Anthony Blunt in 1967.

The gallery in the east wing had been intended for the display of paintings celebrating Henry IV and buildings housing stables and services were planned to either side of the pavilions flanking the entrance on the street, but these projects remained unfinished in 1631, when the Queen Mother was forced from court, following the &quot;Day of the Dupes&quot; in November. Louis XIII commissioned further decorations for the Palace from Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne.

In 1642, Marie de&#x27; Medici bequeathed the Luxembourg to her second and favourite son, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who called it the Orléans Palace (&quot;Palais d&#x27;Orléans&quot;) but by popular will it was still known by its original name. Upon Gaston&#x27;s death, the palace passed to his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine, then to his elder daughter by his first marriage, Anne, Duchess of Montpensier &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot;. In 1660, Anne de Montpensier sold the Luxembourg to her younger half-sister, Élisabeth Marguerite of Orléans, duchess of Guise who, in turn, gave it to her cousin, King Louis XIV, in 1694.

In 1715, the Luxembourg Palace became the residence of Marie Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Berry. The widowed Duchess was notoriously promiscuous, having the reputation of a French Messalina, relentlessly driven by her unquenchable thirst for all pleasures of the flesh. The palace and its gardens thus became stages where the princess acted out her ambitions, enthroned like a queen surrounded by her court. In some of her more exclusive parties, Madame de Berry also played the leading part in elaborate &quot;tableaux-vivants&quot; that represented mythological scenes and in which she displayed her person impersonating Venus or Diana. According to various satirical songs which scurrilously evoked her amours &quot;the Lady of the Luxembourg&quot; hid several pregnancies, shutting herself up from society when about to give birth. Her taste for strong liquors and her sheer gluttony also scandalized the court. On 21 May 1717, Madame de Berry received Peter the Great at the Luxembourg. She welcomed the visiting Tsar splendidly dressed in a magnificent sack-back gown which showcased her voluptuous bosom as well as her mischievous face but also helped conceal her swelling for she was then in an &quot;interesting condition&quot;.

On 28 February 1718, the Duchess of Berry threw a magnificent party for her visiting aunt, Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans, duchess of Lorraine. The entire palace and its gardens were elaborately illuminated. The lavish banquet was followed by a masked ball. Madame de Berry made a dazzling appearance before her guests. She was then in the full splendour of her youthful beauty and pride and acted as if she were the very incarnation of the goddess of love, mirth, beauty and sensual pleasures. On 2 April 1719, after a gruelling four-day labour, shut up in a small room of her palace, the young widow was delivered of a still-born baby girl, supposedly fathered by her lieutenant of the guards, the Count of Riom. Berry&#x27;s delivery was extremely troublesome and almost killed her. The Church refused her the Sacraments thus adding moral infamy to the physical tortures of the labouring woman. Saint-Simon wrote a very sarcastic description of this childbirth. Hoping to regain her health and undeceive the public that she had been confined, Madame de Berry left Paris and the Luxembourg Palace. She died in her Château de la Muette on 21 July 1719 and, according to Saint-Simon, was found to be again pregnant.

In 1750, the palace became a museum, the forerunner of the Louvre, and was open two days a week until 1779. In 1778, the Luxembourg Palace was given to the Count of Provence by his brother Louis XVI. During the French Revolution, it was briefly a prison, then the seat of the French Directory, and in 1799, the home of the and the first residence of Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul of the French Republic.

===Palace as legislature seat===

From 1799 to 1805, the architect Jean Chalgrin transformed the palace into a legislative building. He demolished the grand central staircase (&quot;escalier d&#x27;honneur&quot;), replacing it with a senate chamber on the first floor, which incorporated and destroyed Marie de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s chapel on the garden side of the &quot;corps de logis&quot;. Chalgrin also enclosed the flanking terraces, making space for a library. At the same time he created a neo-classical &quot;escalier d&#x27;honneur&quot; in the west wing, a single monumental flight enclosed by an Ionic colonnade and covered with a coffered barrel vault, the construction of which resulted in the destruction of the long gallery that had formerly housed the cycle of paintings by Rubens.


Beginning in 1835, the architect Alphonse de Gisors added a new garden wing parallel to the old &quot;corps de logis&quot;, replicating the look of the original 17th-century façade so precisely that it is difficult to distinguish at first glance the old from the new. The new senate chamber was located in what would have been the courtyard area in between.
The new wing included a library (&quot;bibliothèque&quot;) with a cycle of paintings (1845–1847) by Eugène Delacroix. In the 1850s, at the request of Emperor Napoleon III, Gisors created the highly-decorated Salle des Conférences (inspired by the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon of the Louvre), which influenced the nature of subsequent official interiors of the Second Empire, including those of the Palais Garnier.

During the German occupation of France (1940–44), Hermann Göring took over the palace as the headquarters of the Luftwaffe in France and took for himself a sumptuous suite of rooms to accommodate his visits to the French capital. His subordinate, Luftwaffe Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle, was also given an apartment in the Luxembourg Palace. He spent most of the war by enjoying the luxurious surroundings. &quot;The Field Marshal&#x27;s craving for luxury and public display ran a close second to that of his superior, Goering; he was also his match in corpulence&quot;, wrote Armaments Minister Albert Speer after a visit to Sperrle in Paris.

The palace was a designated &quot;strong point&quot; for German forces defending the city in August 1944, but thanks to the decision of Commanding General Dietrich von Choltitz to surrender the city rather than fight, the palace was only minimally damaged although furniture was stolen. On 7 November 1944, after the Liberation of France, the Provisional Consultative Assembly held its first meeting at the Luxembourg Palace.

From 29 July to 15 October 1946, the Luxembourg Palace was the site of the talks of the Paris Peace Conference.

<doc id="614889" wikidata="Q497536" url="?curid=614889" title="Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban">
<text>The Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban () is the house of the Parliament of Bangladesh, located at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar besides St. Joseph Higher Secondary School in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka. Designed while the country was still part of Pakistan by architect Louis Kahn, the complex is one of the largest legislative complexes in the world, covering .

The building was featured prominently in the 2003 film &quot;My Architect&quot;, detailing the career and familial legacy of its architect, Louis Kahn. Robert McCarter, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn&quot;, described the National Parliament of Bangladesh as one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most significant buildings.

==History==
===Establishment===

Before its completion, the first and second Parliaments used the &quot;Old Sangsad Bhaban&quot;, which currently serves as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

In 1959, commander-in-chief Ayub Khan seized power in Pakistan through a military coup and imposed martial law. Aware of the economic, social and political disparity between the two administrative units of Pakistan, East and West, Khan declared Dhaka, the provincial capital of East Pakistan, the country&#x27;s second capital and decided to build one of the buildings of National Assembly of Pakistan in the city. He believed constructing a modern legislative complex would placate the people of East Pakistan. The government sought assistance from South Asian activist and architect Muzharul Islam who recommended bringing in the world&#x27;s top architects for the project. He initially attempted to bring Alvar Aalto and Le Corbusier, who were both unavailable at the time. Islam then enlisted Louis Kahn, his former teacher at Yale. Kahn submitted a preliminary design of the proposed building in Dhaka in 1960, which was approved by the government and land was acquired for its construction in 1961. A year after Kahn was fully commissioned to construct the building, in 1963, he went to East Pakistan to complete its design and construction began in 1964. When the liberation war of Bangladesh started in 1971, the construction of the building stopped. In 1974, three years after the independence of Bangladesh, the third Mujib ministry decided to continue construction without changing the original design. Kahn died when the project was approximately three-quarters completed and it continued under David Wisdom, who worked for Kahn. It was completed on 28 January 1982. It took total of to complete the parliament complex.

===Current developments===

During the second Khaleda ministry, the government communicated plans to construct residences for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. According to some prominent architects, no such plan existed in the original design.

In 2013, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina declared to restore Louis Kahn&#x27;s plans. In 2016, the third Hasina ministry decided to by bringing the original design from Louis Kahn&#x27;s partner Henry Wilcots. On 6 October 2016, to restore the original design, the government announced to move the graves situated at the parliament area which includes the mausoleum of Ziaur Rahman. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which was established by Ziaur Rahman, objected against the decision. On 1 December 2016, the government received the plan. On 7 December 2016, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary general of the Bangladesh Nationalist party, alleged that by restoring the original design and removing the structures except the parliament building and the crescent lake, the government wants to reinstate the flag of Pakistan at the parliament area.

On the occasion of the Mujib Year in 2020, initiatives were taken to undertake renovation projects to modernize the Parliament building. According to the plan, the building included the construction of an archive of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, modernization of some rooms, renovation of walkways, modernization of the MP hostel area, reconstruction of the police barrack and construction of a studio for Sangsad Bangladesh Television, which was scheduled to be constructed by September 2024. During a mass uprising on 5 August, the building was stormed by protesters demanding the resignation of Sheikh Hasina. At that time the building was badly damaged due to attacks, vandalism and looting. Forty firearms were taken from building security by looters but were later returned by students.

==History of use by Parliament==

==Architecture and design==

Louis Kahn designed the entire Jatiya Sangsad complex, which includes lawns, lake and residences for the Members of the Parliament (MPs). The architect&#x27;s key design philosophy was to represent Bengali culture and heritage, while at the same time optimizing the use of space. The exterior of the building is striking in its simplicity, with huge walls deeply recessed by porticoes and large openings of regular geometric shapes. The main building, which is at the center of the complex, is divided into three parts – the Main Plaza, South Plaza and Presidential Plaza. An artificial lake surrounds three sides of the main building of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, extending to the Members of Parliament hostel complex. This skillful use of water to portray the riverine beauty of Bengal adds to the aesthetic value of the site.

===Design philosophy===

Kahn&#x27;s key design philosophy optimizes the use of space while representing Bengali heritage and culture. External lines are deeply recessed by porticoes with huge openings of regular geometric shapes on their exterior, shaping the building&#x27;s overall visual impact.

In the architect Louis Kahn&#x27;s own words:
The lake on three sides of the Bhaban, extending up to the Members&#x27; hostel, adds to the site&#x27;s aesthetics and also portrays the riverine beauty of Bangladesh.

The Parliament building received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1989.

===Bhaban (main building)===
The Bhaban consists of nine individual blocks: the eight peripheral blocks rise to a height of 110&#x27; while the central octagonal block rises to a height of 155&#x27;. All nine blocks include different groups of functional spaces and have different levels, inter-linked horizontally and vertically by corridors, lifts, stairs, light courts, and circular areas. The entire structure is designed to blend into one single, non-differentiable unit, that appears from the exterior to be a single story.

The main committee rooms are located at level two in one of the peripheral blocks. All parliamentary functionaries, including Ministers and chairpersons of some Standing Committees, have offices in the Bhaban. The Parliament Secretariat also occupies offices in the same building.

====Main Plaza====

The most important part of the Main Plaza is the Parliament Chamber, which can house up to 354 members during sessions. There are also two podia and two galleries for VIP visitors. The chamber has a maximum height of with a parabolic shell roof. The roof was designed with a clearance of a single story to let in daylight. Daylight, reflecting from the surrounding walls and octagonal drum, filters into the Parliament Chamber. The efficient and aesthetic use of light was a strong architectural capability of Louis Kahn.

The artificial lighting system has been carefully devised to provide zero obstruction to the entry of daylight. A composite chandelier is suspended from parabolic shell roof. This chandelier in turn consists of a metallic web, spanning the entire chamber, that supports the individual light fixtures.

Upper levels of the block (that contains the Chamber) contain the visitor and press galleries, as well as communication booths, all of which overlook the Parliament Chamber. The block also contains:
*at level one, a library;
*at level three, MPs&#x27; lounges; and
*at the upper level, party rooms.
====South Plaza====
The South Plaza faces the Manik Mia Avenue. It gradually rises to a 20&#x27; height and serves as a beautiful exterior as well as the main entrance (used by members during sessions) to the Parliament Building. It contains:
*controlling gates;
*a driveway;
*a main mechanical plant room;
*offices of maintenance engineers;
*equipment stores; and
*an open plaza with steps and ramps leading directly to the main building.

====Presidential Plaza====

The Presidential Plaza lies to the north and faces the Lake Road. It functions as an intimate plaza for the MPs and other dignitaries. It contains marble steps, a gallery and an open pavement.

;Other information
*Completion date: 1982
*Function: civic
*Construction cost: US$32 million

==Tourism and accessibility==

Although entrance to the Bhaban, the main building, is limited to authorized members of Parliament and staff, the Jatiyo Sangshad complex is always open to visitors. North of the complex, across the Lake Road, is Crescent Lake and Chandrima Uddan. The two complexes together form a major attraction for tourists in Dhaka, especially during national holidays. The complexes are popular among joggers and skaters of Dhaka as well, since the complex is a popular walking route - which can be seen every morning and evening. The area is one of the higher security zones of Dhaka.

The complex can be accessed using any of the four roads surrounding it, however, Manik Mia Avenue and Lake Road are the easiest approaches.

Foreign tourists have the opportunity to visit the Parliament building by paying a fee.

<doc id="614890" wikidata="Q2690249" url="?curid=614890" title="1997 Scottish devolution referendum">
<text>The Scottish devolution referendum of 1997 was a pre-legislative referendum held in Scotland on 11 September 1997 over whether there was support for the creation of a Scottish Parliament with devolved powers, and whether the Parliament should have tax-varying powers. The result was &quot;Yes–Yes&quot;: a majority voted in favour of both proposals, and the Parliament was established following an election in 1999. Turnout for the referendum was 60.4%.

The referendum was a Labour Party manifesto commitment and was held in their first term in office after the 1997 general election, under the provisions of the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997. It was the second referendum held in Scotland over the question of devolution, the first being in 1979, and is to date the only major referendum to be held in any part of the United Kingdom where voters were asked two questions in the same plebiscite.

==Background==

A referendum was held in 1979 under a Labour government which stipulated that a Scottish Assembly would come into being if the referendum had been supported by 50% of votes cast plus a controversial rule whereby at least 40% of the electorate had to vote in favour. Although 51.6% voted in favour, this was only 32.9% of the electorate so the Assembly was not brought into being. Shortly afterwards, the predominantly anti-devolution-led Conservative Party won the 1979 general election.
That government put devolution to one side but it was a policy area that remained on the agenda of the Labour Party. A Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was formed afterwards to continue the campaign. They brought together a committee of &quot;prominent Scots&quot; who drafted the document &quot;A Claim of Right for Scotland&quot;. The &quot;Claim&quot; was published in 1988 and signed by most Scottish politicians, local councils, trade unions and churches. It was agreed to form a Scottish Constitutional Convention, made up of existing MPs and councillors.

The Labour Party included the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in its manifesto for the 1997 general election, which they won with a landslide majority of 179.

==Referendum questions==
The electorate was asked to vote on two sets of statements which corresponded to both proposals.

On the first ballot paper the following appeared:

On the second ballot paper the following appeared:

==Campaign==
Scottish Labour, the SNP, Scottish Liberal Democrats, and Scottish Greens campaigned for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote for both proposals whilst the Scottish Conservatives opposed both proposals. Labour MP Tam Dalyell opposed the creation of the Parliament, but accepted that it should have tax-varying powers if it were to be established.

The official Yes campaign, &quot;Scotland Forward&quot; (styled &quot;Scotland FORward&quot;), was headed by the businessman Nigel Smith and came out of the groups that had previously formed the Scottish Constitutional Convention, along with the Scottish National Party. It was supported by the Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green parties.

The official No campaign, &quot;Think Twice&quot;, was headed by Brian Monteith, a former employee of the Conservative MP Michael Forsyth. Board members included Donald Findlay, rector of the University of St Andrews and vice-chairman of Rangers F.C., and senior Conservative peer Lord Fraser. However, it struggled to get much business support as they were wary of opposing a project that had such support from the new government which had a large majority.

Campaigning in the referendum was suspended between the death and funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. It was speculated that the Scottish referendum could have been postponed, but this would have required a recall of the UK Parliament and an amendment to the Referendums Act.

==Opinion polling==


==Results==
The result was &quot;Yes-Yes&quot;: the majority voted &quot;I agree&quot; in favour of both proposals. Two council areas had an overall &quot;Yes-No&quot; result – Dumfries and Galloway and Orkney. More votes were cast for the first question than the second in all regions (except Fife), with substantially more spoilt ballots for the second question, perhaps due to voter confusion over the two papers.

===Question 1===


====By council area====
===Question 2===


====By council area====
Votes in favour of tax-varying powers still commanded significant majority, when compared to establishing the Parliament per se. A majority voted &#x27;I agree&#x27; in every local council, apart from in Dumfries &amp; Galloway and Orkney.

===Overall turnout by council area===
==Outcome==
In response to the majority voting for &quot;Yes&quot; to both proposals, the UK Parliament passed the Scotland Act 1998. This established a Scottish Parliament for the first time since the adjournment of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland in 1707. The devolved Parliament convened for the first time in May 1999, following its first election. This was a poll that the Conservative Party had to fight despite losing their &quot;No&quot; Campaign and having no Westminster seats in Scotland after losing the 1997 general election. The Scotland Act 1998 also created the Scottish Executive, later to become known as the Scottish Government.

==Reaction to the result==

Professor Tom Devine, academic at the University of Edinburgh, dubbed the referendum result &quot;the most significant development in Scottish political history since the Union of 1707&quot;. As well as the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign leader stated &quot;it does, I hope, end much argument and dispute&quot;. Prime Minister Tony Blair claimed that &quot;the era of big centralised government is over&quot;.

The &quot;Yes&quot; campaign leaders Donald Dewar (Scottish Labour) and Alex Salmond (Scottish National Party) held different views over the devolution proposal. However, they put their political differences aside immediately after the vote in celebration. Despite this, the SNP&#x27;s calls for independence soon reignited with SNP leader Alex Salmond claiming that there would be an independent Scotland within his lifetime. The &quot;No&quot; campaign did not share this optimism and feared that this vote was a catalyst towards the break-up of the Union.

When the Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, went back to London to implement the referendum result, he found the Whitehall civil service unwilling to give up powers and doubting that matters over and above those previously handled by the Scottish Office (such as education, health, transport, police and housing) should be politically devolved. Detail was also lacking in that the Scottish Constitutional Convention had failed to address issues such as the role of The Queen or aspects of tax-varying powers.

<text>Ruisrock is a rock festival held annually on the island of Ruissalo in Turku, Finland.
Ruisrock, founded in 1970, is the second-oldest rock festival in Europe (after Pinkpop) and the oldest in Finland. The festival has attracted international artists throughout its lifetime except around the start of the 2000s (decade), due to the organiser&#x27;s economic issues.

==History==
The festival area is divided into two sections, Niittyalue (&quot;meadow section&quot;) and Ranta-alue (&quot;beach section&quot;).

In 2005, when the German industrial metal band Rammstein performed at the festival, 71,000 visitors attended the festival. In recent years, the number of visitors has fluctuated around 70,000. However, the all-time record was set in 1971, when there were about 100,000 visitors, with artists such as Canned Heat playing.

The 2009 edition of the festival saw a rise in attendance, when during 3 days there was a total of 92,000 visitors. In 2009, musical acts such as Slipknot, Disturbed, Faith No More, Mew, In Flames, Volbeat, Glasvegas, The Sounds, D&#x27;espairsRay, and popular domestic artists including Children of Bodom, HIM, Eppu Normaali, Tehosekoitin played at the festival, including the last live performance by The Crash.

In 2010, the festival was celebrating its 40-year anniversary, with popular artists such as Slash and Ozzy Osbourne playing.

In 2016, three reports of rape that occurred at the festival had surfaced and an additional two for sexual harassment. These claims are still under investigation by the Finnish police.

In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the festival gathered 105,000 people in the Ruissalo People&#x27;s Park during the weekend, and all three days were sold out in each of the three years. The 2020 and 2021 Ruisrocki were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="614900" wikidata="Q604647" url="?curid=614900" title="Dara Shikoh">
<text>Dara Shikoh (20 March 1615 – 30 August 1659), also transliterated as Dara Shukoh, was the eldest son and heir-apparent of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Dara was designated with the title &quot;Padshahzada-i-Buzurg Martaba&quot; () and was favoured as a successor by his father and his elder sister, Princess Jahanara Begum. He had been given the title of &quot;&#x27;Shah-e-Buland Iqbal&#x27;&quot; by Shah Jahan. In the war of succession which ensued after Shah Jahan&#x27;s illness in 1657, Dara was defeated by his younger brother Prince Muhiuddin (later, the Emperor Aurangzeb). He was executed in 1659 on Aurangzeb&#x27;s orders in a bitter struggle for the imperial throne.

Dara was a liberal-minded unorthodox Muslim as opposed to the orthodox Aurangzeb; he authored the work &quot;The Confluence of the Two Seas&quot;, which argues for the harmony of Sufi philosophy in Islam and Vedanta philosophy in Hinduism. A great patron of the arts, he was also more inclined towards philosophy and mysticism rather than military pursuits. The course of the history of the Indian subcontinent, had Dara Shikoh prevailed over Aurangzeb, has been a matter of some conjecture among historians.

== Early life ==

Muhammad Dara Shikoh was born on 20 March 1615 in Ajmer, Rajasthan. He was the first son and third child of Prince Shahib-ud-din Muhammad Khurram and his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The prince was named by his father. &#x27;Dara&#x27; means owner of wealth or star in Persian while the second part of the prince&#x27;s name is commonly spelled in two ways: Shikoh (&quot;terror&quot;) or Shukoh (&quot;majesty&quot; or &quot;grandeur&quot;). Thus, Dara&#x27;s full name can be translated as &quot;Of the Terror of Darius&quot; or &quot;Of the Grandeur of Darius&quot;, respectively. Historian Ebba Koch favours &#x27;Shukoh&#x27;.

Dara Shikoh had thirteen siblings of whom six survived to adulthood: Jahanara Begum, Shah Shuja, Roshanara Begum, Aurangzeb, Murad Bakhsh, and Gauhara Begum. He shared a close relationship with his sister, Jahanara. As part of his formal education, Dara studied the Quran, history, Persian poetry and calligraphy. He was a liberal-minded unorthodox Muslim unlike his father and his younger brother Aurangzeb. Persian was Dara&#x27;s native language, but he also learned Hindi, Arabic and later Sanskrit.

In October 1627, Dara&#x27;s grandfather Emperor Jahangir died, and his father ascended the throne in January 1628 taking the regnal name &#x27;Shah Jahan&#x27;. In 1633, Dara was appointed as the &quot;Vali-ahad&quot; (heir-apparent) to his father. He, along with his older sister Jahanara, were Shah Jahan&#x27;s favourite children.

== Marriage ==
During the life time of his mother Mumtaz Mahal, Dara Shikoh was betrothed to his half-cousin, Princess Nadira Banu Begum, the daughter of his paternal uncle Sultan Parvez Mirza. He married her on 1 February 1633 at Agra amidst great celebrations, pomp and grandeur. By all accounts, Dara and Nadira were devoted to each other and Dara&#x27;s love for Nadira was so profound that unlike the usual practice of polygyny prevalent at the time, he never contracted any other marriage. The imperial couple had seven children together; among them three sons, Sulaiman Shikoh, Mumtaz Shikoh, and Sipihr Shikoh, and a daughter, Jahanzeb Banu Begum, survived to play important roles in future events.

A great patron of the arts, Dara ordered for the compilation of some refined artwork into an album which is now famous by the name of &#x27;Dara Shikhoh Album.&#x27; This album was presented by Dara to his &quot;dearest intimate friend&quot; Nadira in 1641. Dara had at least two concubines, Gul Safeh (also known as Rana Dil) and Udaipuri Mahal (a Georgian or Armenian slave girl). Udaipuri later became a part of Aurangzeb&#x27;s harem after her master&#x27;s defeat.

== Military service ==
 On 10 September 1642, Shah Jahan formally confirmed Dara Shikoh as his heir, granting him the title of &quot;Shahzada-e-Buland Iqbal&quot; (&quot;Prince of High Fortune&quot;) and promoting him to command of 20,000-foot and 20,000 horse. In 1645, he was appointed as &quot;subahdar&quot; (governor) of Allahabad. He was promoted to a command of 30,000-foot and 20,000 horse on 18 April 1648, and was appointed Governor of the province of Gujarat on 3 July.

== The struggle for succession ==

On 6 September 1657, the illness of emperor Shah Jahan triggered a desperate struggle for power among the four Mughal princes, though realistically only Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb had a chance of emerging victorious. Shah Shuja was the first to make his move, declaring himself Mughal Emperor in Bengal and marched towards Agra from the east. Murad Baksh allied himself with Aurangzeb.

== Intellectual pursuits ==
Dara Shikoh is widely renowned as an enlightened paragon of the harmonious coexistence of heterodox traditions on the Indian subcontinent. He was an erudite champion of mystical religious speculation and a poetic diviner of syncretic cultural interaction among people of all faiths. This made him a heretic in the eyes of his orthodox younger brother and a suspect eccentric in the view of many of the worldly power brokers swarming around the Mughal throne. Dara Shikoh was a follower of the Armenian Sufi-perennialist mystic Sarmad Kashani, as well as Lahore&#x27;s famous Qadiri Sufi saint Mian Mir, whom he was introduced to by Mullah Shah Badakhshi (Mian Mir&#x27;s spiritual disciple and successor). Mian Mir was so widely respected among all communities that he was invited to lay the foundation stone of the Golden Temple in Amritsar by the Sikhs.

Dara Shikoh subsequently developed a friendship with the seventh Sikh Guru, Guru Har Rai. Dara Shikoh devoted much effort towards finding a common mystical language between Islam and Hinduism. Towards this goal he completed the translation of fifty Upanishads from their original Sanskrit into Persian in 1657 so that they could be studied by Muslim scholars. His translation is often called &quot;Sirr-i-Akbar&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Mystery&quot;), where he states boldly, in the introduction, his speculative hypothesis that the work referred to in the Qur&#x27;an as the &quot;Kitab al-maknun&quot; or the &quot;hidden book&quot;, is none other than the Upanishads. His most famous work, Majma-ul-Bahrain (&quot;The Confluence of the Two Seas&quot;), was also devoted to a revelation of the mystical and pluralistic affinities between Sufic and Vedantic speculation. The book was authored as a short treatise in Persian in 1654–55.

In 1006 A.H, the prince had commissioned a translation of Yoga Vasistha, after both Vasistha and Rama appeared before Dara Shikoh and embraced him in his dream. Translation was undertaken by Nizam al-Din Panipati this translation came to be known as the &quot;Jug-Basisht&quot;, which has since become popular in Persia among intellectuals interested in Indo-Persian culture. The Safavid-era mystic Mir Findiriski (d. 1641) commented on selected passages of &quot;Jug-Basisht&quot;.

The library established by Dara Shikoh still exists on the grounds of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Kashmiri Gate, Delhi, and is now run as a museum by Archaeological Survey of India after being renovated.

== Patron of arts ==

He was also a patron of fine arts, music and dancing, a trait frowned upon by his younger sibling Muhiuddin, later the Emperor Aurangzeb. The &#x27;Dara Shikoh&#x27; is a collection of paintings and calligraphy assembled from the 1630s until his death. It was presented to his wife Nadira Banu in 1641–42 and remained with her until her death after which the album was taken into the royal library and the inscriptions connecting it with Dara Shikoh were deliberately erased; however not everything was vandalised and many calligraphy scripts and paintings still bear his mark.

Among the existing paintings from the Dara Shikoh Album, are two facing pages, compiled in the early 1630s just before his marriage, showing two ascetics in yogic postures, probably meant to be a pair of yogis, Vaishnava and Shaiva. These paintings are attributed to the artist Govardhan. The album also contains numerous pictures of Muslim ascetics and divines and the pictures obviously reflect Dara Shikoh&#x27;s interest in religion and philosophy.

Dara Shikoh is also credited with the commissioning of several exquisite, still extant, examples of Mughal architecture – among them the tomb of his wife Nadira Begum in Lahore, the Shrine of Mian Mir also in Lahore, the Dara Shikoh Library in Delhi, the Akhund Mullah Shah Masjid in Srinagar in Kashmir and the Pari Mahal garden palace (also in Srinagar in Kashmir).
== Death and aftermath ==
After the defeat, Dara Shikoh retreated from Agra to Delhi and thence to Lahore. His next destination was Multan and then to Thatta (Sindh). From Sindh, he crossed the Rann of Kachchh and reached Kathiawar, where he met Shah Nawaz Khan, the governor of the province of Gujarat who opened the treasury to Dara Shikoh and helped him to recruit a new army. He occupied Surat and advanced towards Ajmer. Foiled in his hopes of persuading the fickle but powerful Rajput feudatory, Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Marwar, to support his cause, Dara Shikoh decided to make a stand and fight the relentless pursuers sent by Aurangzeb, but was once again comprehensively routed in the battle of Deorai (near Ajmer) on 11 March 1659. After this defeat he fled to Sindh and sought refuge under Malik Jeevan (Junaid Khan Barozai), an Afghan chieftain, whose life had on more than one occasion been saved by the Mughal prince from the wrath of Shah Jahan. However, Junaid held Dara Shikoh by his wrist and seized him. Then he gave the news to Aurangzeb that he has captured Dara Shikoh. Aurangzeb sent his army to Malik Jeevan&#x27;s place. Aurangzeb&#x27;s army captured Dara Shikoh on 10 June 1659.

Dara Shikoh was brought to Delhi, placed on a filthy elephant and paraded through the streets of the capital in chains. Dara Shikoh&#x27;s fate was decided by the political threat he posed as a prince popular with the common people – a convocation of nobles and clergy, called by Aurangzeb in response to the perceived danger of insurrection in Delhi, declared him a threat to the public peace and an apostate from Islam. He was killed by four of Aurangzeb&#x27;s henchmen in front of his terrified son on the night of 30 August 1659 (9 September Gregorian). After death the remains of Dara Shikoh were buried in an unidentified grave in Humayun&#x27;s tomb in Delhi at the age of 59 . 

Niccolao Manucci, the Venetian traveler who worked in the Mughal court, has written down the details of Dara Shikoh&#x27;s death. According to him, upon Dara&#x27;s capture, Aurangzeb ordered his men to have his head brought up to him and he inspected it thoroughly to ensure that it was Dara indeed. He then further mutilated the head with his sword three times. After which, he ordered the head to be put in a box and presented to his ailing father, Shah Jahan, with clear instructions to be delivered only when the old King sat for his dinner in his prison. The guards were also instructed to inform Shah Jahan that, &quot;&quot;King Aurangzeb, your son, sends this plate to let him (Shah Jahan) see that he does not forget him&quot;.&quot; Shah Jahan instantly became happy (not knowing what was in store in the box) and uttered, &quot;“Blessed be God that my son still remembers me&quot;. &quot;Upon opening the box, Shah Jahan became horrified and fell unconscious&quot;.&quot;

== Quest for the tomb ==

The exact burial location of Dara Shikoh remained a mystery for over two centuries until 2020, when Sanjeev Kumar Singh, an engineer at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), identified the grave among several marked and unmarked graves in Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi. Singh&#x27;s discovery has garnered attention from the likes of Irfan Habib, B.R. Mani, and K. K. Muhammed. 

After four years of research, Singh concluded that one of the three unmarked cenotaphs in the north-western chamber beneath the dome of Humayun’s Tomb marks Dara Shikoh&#x27;s grave.

His claim is based on the Alamgirnama, a biography of Aurangzeb, which mentions that Dara Shikoh was buried below the dome of Humayun’s Tomb, alongside Akbar’s sons, Danyal and Murad. The relevant passage from the Alamgirnama was translated for Singh by Prof. Aleem Ashraf Khan, Head of the Persian Department at Delhi University. Additionally, Singh has studied the architectural style of the cenotaphs, which he argues aligns with the period of Dara Shikoh’s death.

===Archaeologists&#x27; views on Singh’s research===

On 26 February 2020, the Government of India, through the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), initiated a project to identify Dara Shikoh’s grave from among the 140 graves in the 120 chambers inside Humayun&#x27;s Tomb. The effort is considered challenging due to the absence of identifying inscriptions on the graves. At least five of the seven members have acknowledged and supported Sanjeev Kumar Singh’s research, agreeing that he has correctly identified the grave of Dara Shikoh. The members supporting Singh&#x27;s findings include retired ASI Additional Director General Dr. B.R. Mani, retired ASI Joint Director General Dr. K.N. Dikshit, retired ASI Director Northern Region Padma Shri K. K. Muhammed, retired ASI Director of the School of Archaeology B.M. Pande, and retired ASI Director of Epigraphy (Arabic and Persian) Dr. G.S. Khwaja. These experts have recognized Singh&#x27;s research as credible, aligning with historical and architectural evidence. 

Comments from other members, except for Former ASI Director (Archaeology) Syed Jamal Hassan, are not publicly known as the report has not yet been released. Dr. Hassan has expressed doubts, citing the lack of inscriptions and confirming references. Following a Right to Information query in 2021, the ASI responded that it had not yet found Dara Shikoh&#x27;s grave. In March 2021, the then culture Minister Mr. Prahlad Sigh Patel stated in the Rajya Sabha that the committee was studying Dara Shikoh’s heritage, but the final report is still awaited. However, Senior Archaeologist and former Director of the School of Archaeology of Archaeological Survey of India, Shri B.M. Pande has said that &quot;Dara&#x27;s grave has been identified.&quot;

===Historians&#x27; views on Singh’s research===

Several internationally renowned historians specializing in medieval Mughal India have also supported Singh’s claim. Padma Bhushan Irfan Habib, Professor Emeritus at Aligarh Muslim University, stated, &quot;I am not an archaeologist or indeed an architect myself, but as far as I can comprehend, the identification of Dara Shikoh&#x27;s grave seems to be quite definitive and should secure general acceptance.&quot;

Former Head of the History Department at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Prof. Harbans Mukhia, commented, &quot;He appears to have definitively and decisively located the grave of Dara Shikoh, which was always known to be located in Humayun&#x27;s Tomb. He has examined his quarry from every angle—the textual evidence, the architectural features, the meaning of the exact placement of the tomb—and visited the site several times to be certain of his search. At the end of it, he has given proof of the grave&#x27;s location with no reasonable doubt left.&quot;

Farhat Nasreen, Head of the Department of History at Jamia Millia Islamia, praised the research, saying, &quot;His research is very fascinating; it is remarkable that through his relentless hard work, he has solved one of the biggest mysteries.&quot;

Prof. S.H. Qasemi, former Head of the Department of Persian at the University of Delhi, expressed his agreement with Singh&#x27;s findings, stating, &quot;I have myself gone through the reference to Dara Shukoh&#x27;s burial in the Alamgirnama and also saw the location identified by Sanjeev in Humayun&#x27;s Tomb. I can confirm that the location of the grave identified by him completely matches the description of Dara Shukoh’s burial place in the Alamgirnama.&quot; 

Singh has delivered lectures on his findings and research regarding the grave of Dara Shikoh at various esteemed institutions, including Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), the India International Centre (IIC), and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.

His research paper, &quot;दारा शुकोह की क़ब्र की खोज - एक अध्ययन&quot; (In the Search of Dara Shukoh’s Tomb - A Study), has been published in Purapravah, an international journal of archaeology and history published in Hindi by the Indian Archaeological Society.

<doc id="614901" wikidata="Q357510" url="?curid=614901" title="Mark Kelly">
<text>Mark Edward Kelly (born February 21, 1964) is an American politician, retired astronaut, and United States Navy captain serving as the senior United States senator from Arizona, a seat he has held since 2020. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Kelly flew combat missions during the Gulf War as a naval aviator before being selected as a NASA Space Shuttle pilot in 1996. He flew his first space mission in 2001 as pilot of STS-108, then piloted STS-121 in 2006, and commanded STS-124 in 2008 and STS-134 (the final mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;) in 2011. In January 2011, Kelly&#x27;s wife, then-Arizona Representative Gabby Giffords, was shot and nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Arizona. Kelly retired from the Navy and NASA that October. In 2013, Kelly and Giffords founded a nonprofit political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions (later merged into Giffords), which campaigned for gun control measures like universal background checks.

On February 12, 2019, Kelly announced his candidacy for Arizona&#x27;s Class 3 U.S. Senate seat in the 2020 special election. He won the Democratic primary on August 4, 2020, and defeated incumbent Republican Martha McSally in the general election on November 3, becoming the first Democrat to win this seat since 1962. Kelly was sworn in on December 2. In 2022, he was elected to a full term in office, defeating Republican challenger Blake Masters. Independent Kyrsten Sinema&#x27;s departure from the Senate in 2025 made Kelly Arizona&#x27;s senior senator. He was reportedly one of the three leading contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, along with Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota governor Tim Walz. Presidential nominee Kamala Harris ultimately chose Walz.
==Early life and education==
Mark Kelly and his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly, are sons of Richard and Patricia (née McAvoy) Kelly, two retired police officers. Kelly is of Irish descent. He was born on February 21, 1964, in Orange, New Jersey, and raised in West Orange, New Jersey. Kelly graduated from Mountain High School in 1982. In 1986, he took highest honors in a marine engineering and nautical science BSc from the United States Merchant Marine Academy. In 1994, he received a MSc in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.

==Naval career (1987–2011)==
In December 1987, Kelly became a naval aviator and received initial training on the A-6E Intruder attack aircraft. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron 115 (VA-115) at NAF Atsugi in Kanagawa, Japan. He was deployed twice with VA-115 to the Persian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier , which was homeported at Naval Station Yokosuka in Yokosuka, Japan. During Operation Desert Storm, Kelly flew 39 combat missions. After the Gulf War, Kelly received his master&#x27;s degree and then attended U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from 1993 to 1994. As a naval aviator and test pilot, he has logged over 5,000 hours in more than 50 different aircraft and trapped over 375 carrier landings.

During his Navy career, Kelly received two Defense Superior Service Medals; one Legion of Merit; two Distinguished Flying Crosses; four Air Medals (two individual/two strike flight) with Combat &quot;V&quot;; two Navy Commendation Medals, (one with combat &quot;V&quot;); one Navy Achievement Medal; two Southwest Asia Service Medals; one Navy Expeditionary Medal; two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons; a NASA Distinguished Service Medal; and an Overseas Service Ribbon.

On June 21, 2011, Kelly announced his retirement from both the Navy and NASA, effective October 1, citing Gabby Giffords&#x27;s needs during her recovery from the attempt on her life that January.

==NASA career (1996–2011)==
NASA selected both Kelly and his identical twin, Scott Kelly, to be Space Shuttle pilots in 1996. They joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in August of that year. They are the only siblings to have both traveled into orbit.

=== Spaceflight experience ===

====STS-108====

Kelly&#x27;s first trip into space was as pilot of STS-108. After several delays, &quot;Endeavour&quot; lifted off on December 5, 2001, on the final Shuttle mission of 2001.

STS-108 &quot;Endeavour&quot; visited the ISS, delivering over three tons of equipment, supplies, and a fresh crew to the orbiting outpost. The hatches were opened between &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the ISS&quot; Destiny &quot;Laboratory on December 7, enabling the 10 crew members to greet one another. The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117-day residency on board the ISS on December 8 as their custom &quot;Soyuz&quot; seat-liners were transferred to &quot;Endeavour&quot; for the return trip home. The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat-liners to the&quot; Soyuz &quot;return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews.

Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin used the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm to lift the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station&#x27;s Unity node. The crews began unloading supplies the same day. Mission managers extended &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor in one of the air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.

Kelly traveled over 4.8 million miles and orbited the Earth 186 times over 11 days and 19+ hours.

====STS-121====

In July 2006, Kelly piloted STS-121 &quot;Discovery&quot;, the second &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission after the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; in February 2003. Because of weather delays, STS-121 became the first shuttle mission to launch on the Fourth of July. In 2006, Kelly discussed the risks aboard the Space Shuttle:

The mission&#x27;s main purposes were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster and to deliver supplies, equipment, and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS. Reiter&#x27;s transfer returned the ISS to a three-member staffing level.

During the STS-121 mission to the ISS, the crew of &quot;Discovery&quot; continued to test new equipment and procedures for the inspection and repair of the thermal protection system that is designed to increase the shuttles&#x27; safety. It also delivered more supplies and cargo for future ISS expansion.

After the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, NASA decided that two test flights would be required and that activities originally assigned to STS-114 would be divided into two missions because of the addition of post-&quot;Columbia&quot; safety tests.

Gabby Giffords, Kelly&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, picked one of the mission&#x27;s wake-up songs, U2&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;. During the U2 360° Tour, Kelly often appeared on screen from the International Space Station during the song&#x27;s introduction, greeting the city the band was playing in and asking the crowd to &quot;tell my wife I love her very much, she knows&quot;—a reference to David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;; the tour&#x27;s staging was often called the &quot;space station&quot;.

Kelly traveled over 5.28 million miles and orbited the Earth 202 times over 12 days and 18+ hours.

====STS-124====

STS-124 &quot;Discovery&quot; was Kelly&#x27;s first mission as commander. A month before liftoff, he discussed what being a shuttle commander entailed and how it was different from his previous missions:

The mission was the second of three shuttle missions to carry components of Japan&#x27;s Kibo laboratory to the ISS. &quot;Kibo&quot; is Japanese for &quot;hope&quot;. The laboratory is Japan&#x27;s primary contribution to the ISS.

Just before liftoff, Kelly said, &quot;While we&#x27;ve all prepared for this event today, the discoveries from Kibo will definitely offer hope for tomorrow. Now stand by for the greatest show on Earth.&quot;

During the launch, Launch Pad 39A sustained substantial damage, more than had been seen on any previous launch. After liftoff, inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad&#x27;s base had been thrown as far as the perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457 m).

Kelly and his crew delivered the pressurized module for Kibo to the ISS. The module is the Kibo laboratory&#x27;s largest component and the station&#x27;s largest habitable module. &quot;Discovery&quot; also delivered Kibo&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System. It also delivered a replacement part for the station&#x27;s toilet. The ISS&#x27;s toilet had been malfunctioning for a week, creating a potentially serious problem for the crew. When Kelly first entered the station, he joked, &quot;You looking for a plumber?&quot;

This mission was the first time a spouse of a member of Congress traveled to space. Kelly traveled over 5.7 million miles, and orbited the Earth 218 times over 13 days and 18 hours. As of 2009, Kelly had logged over 54 days in space overall.

====STS-134====

STS-134 launched on May 16, 2011.

On April 29, 2011, the first launch attempt of STS-134 was scrubbed. Giffords traveled to Florida on her first trip since moving from Tucson to Houston in January after an attempted assassination. Her appearance at Kennedy Space Center gave the launch a high profile, &quot;one of the most anticipated in years,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. President Barack Obama visited the Kennedy Space Center on April 29 on a trip with the original intention of watching the &quot;Endeavour&quot; launch.

Kelly was the commander of the mission, which was &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s last. He and his crew delivered the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the ISS.

Most of the mission&#x27;s delays were caused by external tank issues on STS-133 &quot;Discovery&quot;. When Scott Kelly went to the ISS on October 7, 2010, STS-134 was scheduled to go to the station during his mission. The potential rendezvous in space of the Kelly brothers would have been a first meeting of blood relatives in space. The delay of STS-134&#x27;s launch ended that possibility.

After his wife&#x27;s shooting, Kelly&#x27;s status was unclear, but NASA announced on February 4, 2011, that he would remain commander of the mission. The remarkable progress his wife was making in her recovery helped Kelly decide to return to training. Peggy Whitson, chief of the NASA Astronaut Office at the time, said, &quot;we are confident in his ability to successfully lead this mission, and I know I speak for all of NASA in saying &#x27;welcome back.&#x27;&quot;

====Papal blessing====
At 4 pm PDT on May 22, 2011, the European Space Agency and Italian Space Agency arranged for a call to &quot;Endeavour&quot; by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by the discovery of a gash in the Shuttle&#x27;s fuselage—Benedict extended his blessing to Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a pope spoke to astronauts during a mission.

====U2====
On June 24, 2011, a recorded message by Kelly from the ISS wished his wife love using song lyrics from David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and introduced U2&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; on the first night of the Glastonbury festival in England. A similar message from Kelly aboard the ISS was played during U2&#x27;s 360° Tour concert stop at various locations. It said: &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to coming home. Tell my wife I love her very much. She knows.&quot;

===Retirement===
On June 21, 2011, Kelly announced that he would leave NASA&#x27;s astronaut corps and the U.S. Navy effective October 1. He cited Giffords&#x27;s needs during her recovery as a reason for his retirement. He announced his retirement on his Facebook page, writing: &quot;Words cannot convey my deep gratitude for the opportunities I have been given to serve our great nation. From the day I entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment I landed the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; three weeks ago, it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the United States of America.&quot;

== Post-NASA career (2011–2016) ==

=== Author ===
In 2011, Kelly and Giffords coauthored &quot;Gabby: A Story of Courage, Love and Resilience&quot;. The book provides biographical information on the couple and describes in detail the assassination attempt on Giffords and her initial recovery. Written in Kelly&#x27;s voice, it includes a short note by Giffords at the end.

Kelly&#x27;s second book, &quot;Mousetronaut: Based on a (Partially) True Story&quot; (2012), is a children&#x27;s book illustrated by C. F. Payne. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; number one bestseller and was followed the next year by a sequel, &quot;Mousetronaut Goes to Mars&quot;.

In 2014, Giffords and Kelly coauthored &quot;Enough: Our Fight to Keep America Safe from Gun Violence&quot;.

In 2015, Kelly and Martha Freeman co-wrote &quot;Astrotwins: Project Blastoff,&quot; a fictional story about twins Scott and Mark who build a space capsule in their grandfather&#x27;s backyard and try to send the first kid into orbit. Kelly dedicated this book to Scott Kelly. The sequel, &quot;Astrotwins—Project Rescue&quot;, was published in 2016.

=== Aerospace work ===
Kelly was a co-founder and strategic advisor of Tucson-based high-altitude balloon near-space exploration company World View Enterprises. He served as Director of Flight Crew Operations beginning in 2013, and was involved in the development of the new craft, as well as its procedures and operations. Chinese company Tencent invested millions into World View between 2013 and 2016. Kelly left World View in 2019, before he started his Senate campaign; as of 2021 he held over $100,000 of World View stocks through a blind trust.

On March 28, 2012, SpaceX announced that Kelly would be part of an independent safety advisory panel composed of leading human spaceflight safety experts.

=== Speeches ===

From 2011 to 2016, Kelly delivered paid speeches in the U.S. and in China on behalf of Shaklee, a multi-level marketing distributor of nutritional supplements.

Separately, Kelly has also delivered paid speeches to bank Goldman Sachs, the Mortgage Bankers Association, and drug company AmerisourceBergen.

=== Political activism ===
In January 2013, weeks after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Kelly and Giffords started a nonprofit political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS). The organization&#x27;s mission is to promote solutions to gun violence with elected officials and the general public. The couple say it supports the Second Amendment while promoting responsible gun ownership and &quot;keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill&quot;. The group claims that &quot;current gun laws allow private sellers to sell guns without a background check, creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns&quot;. On March 31, 2013, Kelly said, &quot;any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake. It&#x27;s the most common-sense thing we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons.&quot; In 2016, ARS merged with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence to become Giffords, which besides background checks advocates for red flag laws.

== U.S. Senate (2020–present) ==
===Elections===
====2020 special====
On February 12, 2019, Kelly announced that he would run as a Democrat in the 2020 U.S. Senate special election in Arizona. Kelly looked to unseat incumbent Republican Martha McSally, a fellow veteran who was appointed to the seat shortly after losing the 2018 election for the state&#x27;s other seat in the Senate to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. The seat was vacated upon John McCain&#x27;s death on August 25, 2018, and held by Governor Doug Ducey&#x27;s appointee Jon Kyl until Kyl resigned on December 31, 2018. Kelly declined to accept campaign contributions from corporate political action committees (PACs), but did accept thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from corporate executives and lobbyists.

The Associated Press called the race for Kelly on November 4, 2020. His election marks the first time since 1953 that Arizona has had two Democratic senators. As the election was a special election, Kelly took office during the 116th Congress, shortly after Arizona certified its election results on November 30, unlike other senators and representatives elected in 2020, who took office at the opening of the 117th Congress on January 3, 2021. Kelly was sworn in at noon on December 2.

Kelly is the fifth retired astronaut to be elected to Congress, after John Glenn, Harrison Schmitt, Bill Nelson, and Jack Swigert.

==== 2022 ====
Kelly was reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Blake Masters by 125,719 votes.

=== Tenure ===
On December 2, 2020, Kelly cast his first Senate vote, a &quot;no&quot; vote on the nomination of Kathryn C. Davis to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. On December 9, Kelly voted &quot;no&quot; on a resolution blocking President Donald Trump from selling $23 billion in drones to the United Arab Emirates. Kelly split his vote by voting yes on another resolution blocking F-35 sales to the UAE. Both resolutions failed.

In the wake of the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, Kelly said that Vice President Mike Pence and Trump&#x27;s cabinet &quot;have the responsibility to discuss invoking the 25th amendment&quot;, Section 4 of which allows the vice president and cabinet to declare the president unable to serve and transfer presidential power to the vice president. Kelly voted to convict in Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial, along with 56 other senators.

In January 2023, three bills regarding Indian tribes, introduced by Kelly and fellow Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, were signed into law by President Joe Biden. One bill regarding the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act allocated more federal money and time to build water infrastructure for the White Mountain Apache Tribe. A second bill, the Colorado River Indian Tribes Water Resiliency Act, permitted the Colorado River Indian Tribes (the Mohave, Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo) to begin leasing out parts of the Colorado River they were allocated, while a third bill, the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act, allocated part of the Colorado River to the Hualapai tribe, so that water infrastructure can deliver water to the tribe.

During the 117th Congress, Kelly co-sponsored several legislative bills that were supported by both parties and became law; these bills included those on the topics of mandating de-escalation training for law enforcement, updating ocean shipping governance, combating human trafficking, and reimbursing people suffering from radiation from atomic weapon tests; during the 118th Congress, Kelly co-sponsored the bipartisan END FENTANYL Act, passed in 2023. The law requires United States Customs and Border Protection to refresh its interdiction procedures at least every three years to mitigate advances in narcotics and human trafficking across the U.S. southern border.

=== Committee assignments ===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Airland
**Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (chairman)

== Political positions ==

Kelly ran as a moderate in 2020 and voiced support for bipartisanship. Since joining the Senate, he supported abolishing the filibuster in order to pass voting rights legislation and a federal minimum wage increase to $15 per hour. He has criticized Joe Biden&#x27;s approach to border security. As of October 2022, Kelly has voted in line with Biden&#x27;s stated position 94.5% of the time.

===Abortion===
As a candidate in 2020, Kelly said he was &quot;pro-choice&quot; and was endorsed by Planned Parenthood. He supports codifying &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; into federal law. He has said that late-stage abortions should be legally protected.

=== Climate and environment ===
Kelly has voiced support for climate action, but said he &quot;does not favor&quot; the Green New Deal. The League of Conservation Voters gave him a 97% score in 2021. In a 2021 Greenpeace exposé, Kelly was one of 11 U.S. senators ExxonMobil Senior Director for Federal Relations Keith McCoy called &quot;crucial&quot; to the company. Kelly has received funding from ExxonMobil lobbyists. In 2022, he advocated for an expansion of oil drilling in the wake of rising gas prices.

===Guns===
Kelly became an outspoken advocate for gun control after the attempted assassination of his wife, former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, in the 2011 Tucson mass shooting.

Kelly voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in response to the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

===Health care===
Kelly supports building on the Affordable Care Act to include a public health insurance option. He opposes Medicare for All.

===Immigration===
Kelly has expressed support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, saying, &quot;Dreamers are as American as anyone.&quot; In July 2024, he blamed former President Donald Trump for sinking a bipartisan border bill.

In 2025, Kelly was one of 12 Senate Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

===Donald Trump===
In February 2021, Kelly voted to convict Trump for incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial, and has been outspoken in his disdain for him.

==Personal life==
Kelly married Amelia Victoria Babis on January 7, 1989. They divorced in 2004. They have two daughters, Claudia and Claire Kelly.

Kelly married U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords of Tucson on November 10, 2007, in a ceremony presided over by Rabbi Stephanie Aaron and attended by his STS-124 shuttle crew and former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. Reich toasted: &quot;To a bride who moves at a velocity that exceeds that of anyone else in Washington, and a groom who moves at a velocity that exceeds 17,000 miles per hour.&quot; The couple met on a 2003 trip to China as part of a trade mission sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.–China Relations.

At the time of their marriage, Kelly lived in Houston, Texas, and said that the longest stretch of time the two had spent together was a couple of weeks. He said that they did not plan to always live that way, but that it was what they were used to. He added, &quot;It teaches you not to sweat the small stuff.&quot;

Kelly appeared on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; in 2015.

===Shooting in Tucson===
Giffords was shot in an assassination attempt on January 8, 2011, which killed six people and brought national attention to Kelly. On February 4, Kelly described the previous month as the hardest time of his life and expressed his gratitude for the enormous outpouring of support, good wishes and prayers for his wife. He said that he believed people&#x27;s prayers for her helped.

One of Giffords&#x27;s aides informed Kelly of the shooting almost immediately after it happened. He flew from Houston to Tucson with members of his family. En route, the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died. &quot;The kids, Claudia and Claire, started crying. My mother, she almost screamed. I just walked into the bathroom, and, you know, broke down.&quot; Calling family in Tucson, Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery. &quot;It was a terrible mistake,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;As bad as it was that she had died, it&#x27;s equally exciting that she hadn&#x27;t.&quot;

From the time he arrived in Tucson, Kelly sat vigil at his wife&#x27;s bedside as she struggled to survive and began to recover. As her condition began to improve, the Kelly-Giffords family researched options for rehabilitation facilities and chose one in Houston. On January 21, Giffords was transferred to the Memorial Hermann–Texas Medical Center, where she spent five days before moving to TIRR Memorial Hermann, where she continued her recovery and rehabilitation.

Giffords and Kelly had spoken dozens of times about how risky her job was. She was afraid that someone with a gun would come up to her at a public event. In an interview filmed just over a week after the shooting, Kelly said, &quot;She has Tombstone, Arizona, in her district, the town that&#x27;s too tough to die. Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her.&quot;

====Aftermath====
A memorial service for those killed in the assassination attempt was held on January 12, 2011, at the University of Arizona. President Obama flew to Tucson to speak at the memorial. Kelly sat between First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, the former governor of Arizona. At the end of the service, Obama consoled and embraced him, after which Kelly returned to the hospital to be with his wife.

Kelly spoke on February 3, 2011, at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. His remarks closed the event, where Obama also spoke. Kelly said the attack on his wife brought him closer to God and gave him a newfound awareness regarding prayer. He said that before the attack, &quot;I thought the world just spins and the clock just ticks and things happen for no particular reason&quot;, but that, in Tucson, as he found himself wandering in makeshift memorials and shrines filled with Bibles and angels, &quot;You pray where you are. You pray when God is there in your heart.&quot; Kelly offered the final prayer of the morning, lightly adapted by Rabbi Stephanie Aaron from a traditional bedtime prayer. Rabbi Aaron, who married Kelly and Giffords, had said the same words over Giffords on the night of the shooting:

In 2011, Kelly said he believed there was a chance to change a political environment he believed was too vitriolic. He hoped that the tragedy would be an opportunity to improve the tone of the national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric. In response to a question on February 4, 2011, about civility in politics, Kelly said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby&#x27;s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it&#x27;s really, really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it. I think that will happen, so those are good things.&quot;

<text>Scott Joseph Kelly (born February 21, 1964) is an American engineer, retired astronaut, and naval aviator. A veteran of four space flights, Kelly commanded the International Space Station (ISS) on Expeditions 26, 44, 45, and 46.

Kelly&#x27;s first spaceflight was as pilot of during STS-103 in December 1999. This was the third servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, and lasted for just under eight days. Kelly&#x27;s second spaceflight was as mission commander of STS-118, a 12-day Space Shuttle mission to the ISS in August 2007. Kelly&#x27;s third spaceflight was as a crewmember on Expedition 25/26 on the ISS. He arrived at the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-01M on October 9, 2010, and served as a flight engineer until he took over command of the station on November 25, 2010, at the start of Expedition 26. Expedition 26 ended on March 16, 2011, with the departure of Soyuz TMA-01M.

In November 2012, Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko were selected for a year-long mission to the ISS. Their year in space began with the launch of Soyuz TMA-16M on March 27, 2015, and they remained on the station for Expeditions 43, 44, 45, and 46. The mission ended on March 1, 2016, with the departure of Soyuz TMA-18M from the station.

Kelly retired from NASA on April 1, 2016. His identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, is also a retired astronaut, and the senior U.S. senator from Arizona.

== Early life and education ==
Scott Kelly was born, along with his identical twin brother Mark, on February 21, 1964, in Orange, New Jersey, to Patricia (McAvoy) and Richard Kelly. Kelly&#x27;s family lived in West Orange, where his parents worked as police officers. Kelly and his brother graduated from West Orange Mountain High School (New Jersey) in 1982. While in high school, Kelly worked as an emergency medical technician in Orange and Jersey City, New Jersey.

After graduating from high school, Kelly enrolled at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. During his first year, Kelly read &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; by Tom Wolfe, and was inspired to pursue a career in naval aviation. After his first year, Kelly transferred to State University of New York Maritime College, where he received a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (Navy ROTC) scholarship. During the summer after his first year, Kelly sailed aboard SUNY Maritime&#x27;s training ship, &quot;Empire State V&quot;, and stopped in Mallorca, Hamburg, and London. After his second year, Kelly sailed again on &quot;Empire State V&quot;. He served as the student battalion commander for his school&#x27;s Navy ROTC detachment, and graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering in 1987. Kelly later earned a Master of Science degree in aviations systems from the University of Tennessee.

== Naval career ==
After graduation, Kelly was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. He completed his initial flight school at NAS Pensacola, where he flew the T-34 Mentor propeller driven trainer plane, after which he was selected to fly jets. In 1988, he moved to Beeville, Texas, for jet training Naval Air Station Chase Field, where he trained on the T-2 Buckeye and the A-4 Skyhawk. He graduated as a naval aviator in 1989, and was assigned to fly the F-14 Tomcat. He reported to VF-101 at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, for initial F-14 training. Upon completion of this training in September 1990, he was assigned to VF-143, and deployed to the North Atlantic and Persian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier .

In January 1993, Kelly was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. His classmates included his brother, Mark, and other future astronauts Alvin Drew, Lisa Nowak, and Stephen Frick. He graduated in June 1994 and was assigned to the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at Patuxent River. One of his initial assignments was to investigate the F-14 crash that killed Kara Hultgreen. His assessment was to create a digital flight control system that would have saved Hultgreen&#x27;s life. This resulted in the acceleration of one&#x27;s development, and he was the first pilot to fly the F-14 with the digital flight control system installed.

After attaining the rank of captain in the U.S. Navy, Kelly retired from active duty on June 19, 2012, after 25 years of naval service. He flew over 8,000 hours in more than 40 aircraft and accomplished over 250 carrier landings throughout his naval career.

== NASA career ==

In 1995, Kelly and his brother applied to NASA to become astronauts. He and Mark were selected to become astronaut candidates in April 1996; the first relatives to be selected in NASA history. In July 1996, Kelly moved to Houston, and began training in Astronaut Group 16 at the Johnson Space Center. On completion of training, he was assigned to work on the caution and warning system on board the International Space Station.

After Kelly&#x27;s first flight on STS-103, he served as NASA&#x27;s director of operations in Star City, Russia. He served as back-up crew member to Peggy Whitson for ISS Expedition 5, and to Tracy Caldwell Dyson on Expedition 23/24. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, Kelly coordinated airplane and helicopter searches for debris. He also served as the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch Chief.

In September 2002, Kelly served as the commander of the NEEMO 4 mission aboard the &quot;Aquarius&quot; underwater laboratory, 4 mi offshore from Key Largo. The NEEMO 4 crew spent five days saturation diving from &quot;Aquarius&quot; as a space analog for working and training under extreme environmental conditions. The mission was delayed due to Hurricane Isidore, reducing the underwater duration to five days. In April 2005, Kelly was a crew member on the three-day NEEMO 8 mission. During the NEEMO 8 mission, the crew practiced construction while conducting an extravehicular activity (EVA) using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, and training with the Exploration Planning Operations Center at the Johnson Space Center.

=== STS-103 ===
In March 1999, Kelly was assigned to STS-103 as a pilot aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;, under command of Curt Brown, on a mission to install new instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on December 19, 1999, and rendezvoused with the HST after 40 orbits. The STS-103 mission specialists conducted three EVAs to replace gyroscopes and a transmitter, and to install a new computer guidance sensor and recorder. On December 25, 1999, the crew celebrated the only Christmas holiday of the Space Shuttle in orbit with a reading by Curt Brown. After 119 orbits, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center on December 27, 1999.

=== STS-118 ===
After completing his assignment as a back-up member for ISS Expedition 5 in 2002, Kelly was assigned as commander of STS-118 aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot;. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, STS-118 was delayed until August 2007. STS-118 launched on August 8, 2007. During the launch, the orbiter was struck by nine pieces of foam from the external tank just as &quot;Columbia&quot; had been on its final, fatal mission. The underside of &quot;Endeavour&quot; was examined by cameras on the robotic arm and the ISS, and was assessed to not be dangerously damaged. The Shuttle successfully docked with the ISS on August 10. &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s crew successfully added a truss segment, an external spare-parts platform, and a control moment gyroscope and to the ISS. The mission was extended to 14 days while testing a new system that enabled docked shuttles to draw electrical power from the station. During the mission, four EVAs to install the new equipment were completed. The mission was ended a day early because of the approach of Hurricane Dean towards Houston. STS-118 completed 201 orbits, and landed on August 21, 2007, at the Kennedy Space Center, after 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes, and 34 seconds.

=== Expeditions 25 and 26 ===
In late 2007, Kelly was assigned to Expeditions 25 and 26. Kelly lifted off aboard &quot;Soyuz TMA-01M&quot; from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 7:10 pm EDT on October 7, 2010, along with cosmonauts Aleksandr Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka. TMA-01M was the first launch of an updated model of the &quot;Soyuz&quot; spacecraft, and featured improved guidance, environmental control, and flight-control systems. Kelly, Kaleri, and Skripochka arrived at the ISS on October 9, 2010, and joined Commander Douglas H. Wheelock and flight engineers Shannon Walker and Fyodor Yurchikhin on Expedition 25.

During Kelly&#x27;s time aboard the ISS, the crew supported about 115 scientific experiments, including an improved water-recycling machine, the Boiler Experiment Facility to test heat transfer in microgravity, and a Japanese experiment to research vegetable growth in microgravity. During Expedition 25, cosmonauts Yurchikhin and Skripochka conducted an EVA to install a workstation on the Zvezda module, install handrails, and removed three Russian experiments. The crew of Expedition 24/25 returned to Earth on November 25, 2010, aboard &quot;Soyuz TMA-19&quot;; Wheelock transferred command of the station to Kelly.

On December 17, 2010, &quot;Soyuz TMA-20&quot; arrived at the station with the crew of Expedition 26/27 cosmonaut Dmitri Kondratyev, NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman, and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli. The crew of STS-133 aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; arrived at the station February 26, 2011. The crew of STS-133 performed two EVAs to replace a pump and install the Permanent Multipurpose Module. &quot;Discovery&quot; undocked from the ISS on March 7, 2011, and landed for the final time two days later.

On January 8, 2011, while Kelly was on the ISS, Kelly&#x27;s sister-in-law Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot in Tucson. &quot;Soyuz TMA-01M&quot; landed in Kazakhstan on March 16, 2011, and Kelly traveled to TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston to see Giffords and Mark. Mark was the commander of STS-134, the final flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and launched on May 16, 2011, with Giffords in attendance. STS-134 had originally been scheduled to launch in February 2011, which would have made the Kelly brothers the first twins to fly together in space.

=== Expeditions 43–46 ===

NASA began planning for a year-long mission aboard the ISS following a Russian announcement for a similar mission. The primary goal of the year-long expedition aboard the orbiting laboratory was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the human body. In November 2012, Kelly was selected for a one-year mission to the ISS, but was medically disqualified the following day due to his vision worsening in microgravity. Kelly appealed to NASA, and was reselected for the mission along with cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko.

Kelly, Kornienko, and Gennady Padalka launched aboard &quot;Soyuz TMA-16M&quot; spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:42 pm EDT on March 27, 2015. &quot;TMA-16M&quot; docked with the ISS at 9:36 pm EDT, and the crew joined the Expedition 43 crew of commander Terry Virts and flight engineers Anton Shkaplerov and Samantha Cristoforetti. Once aboard, the crew performed scientific experiments, including evaluations of the fluid shifts in their bodies to determine their effects on eyesight, and repeated collections of blood and urine for chemical analysis. During Expedition 43, the ISS received supplies from the SpaceX Dragon CRS-6 mission, but lost their resupply due to the failure of the Russian&quot; Progress 59&quot; spacecraft. Expedition 44 began on June 11, 2015, when Virts transferred command of the ISS to Padalka, and &quot;Soyuz TMA-15M &quot;landed in Kazakhstan at 9:44 am EDT.

&quot;Soyuz TMA-17M&quot; docked with the ISS on July 22, 2015, bringing NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, and JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui to join Expedition 44. During Expedition 44, the ISS was resupplied by the JAXA &quot;HTV-5&quot; and the Russian&quot; Progress 60&quot; vehicles; the crew experienced another loss of a resupply mission with the SpaceX&quot; CRS-7 &quot;failure. On August 28, 2016, the crew of &quot;Soyuz TMA-16M&quot; undocked and subsequently docked the spacecraft to a different port to prepare for the arrival of &quot;Soyuz TMA-18M&quot;. &quot;Soyuz TMA-18M&quot; docked with the ISS on September 4, 2015, bringing Russian cosmonaut Sergey Volkov, ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen, and Kazakh cosmonaut Aidyn Aimbetov to the station. One of Soyuz &quot;TMA-18M&#x27;s&quot; missions was to deliver a new &quot;Soyuz&quot; to the station for the return of Kelly, Korniyenko, and Volkov in March 2016; they could not return on &quot;Soyuz TMA-16M&quot; due to the 200-day orbital lifespan of a &quot;Soyuz&quot;. Padalka, Morgensen, and Aimbetov departed from the ISS on September 11, 2015, and landed in Kazakhstan in &quot;Soyuz TMA-16M&quot;.

Expedition 45 began on September 11, 2015, when Padalka transferred command of the station to Kelly. During the expedition, the ISS crew was resupplied by the &quot;Progress 61 &quot;and the &quot;Cygnus CRS OA-4&quot; missions. On October 28, 2015, Kelly and Lindgren performed an EVA to service the Canada Arm 2, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and to install cables for the International Docking Adapter for the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Kelly and Lindgren performed a second EVA on November 6, 2015, to service the ammonia cooling system on the P6 truss. Expedition 46 began on December 11, 2015, with the departure of &quot;Soyuz TMA-17M&quot;, carrying Lindgren, Kononenko, and Yui.

On December 15, 2015, NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra, ESA astronaut Timothy Peake, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko joined Expedition 46 as flight engineers after &quot;Soyuz TMA-19M&quot; docked with the ISS. On December 21, 2015, Kelly and Kopra performed an unscheduled EVA to release the brake handles on the Mobile Transporter rail car for the Canada Arm 2, which had unexpectedly stopped when it was remotely commanded by the flight controllers. After the successful repair of the Mobile Transporter, the ISS crew was resupplied on December 23, 2015, by the &quot;Progress 62&quot; spacecraft. On January 15, 2016, Kopra and Peake performed another EVA and successfully replaced a voltage regulator, but were forced to return early after water began forming inside of Kopra&#x27;s helmet. On January 8, 2016, Kelly appeared in the thank-you note segment of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, with the first ever thank-you note from space. Russian cosmonauts Malenchenko and Volkov conducted an EVA on February 3, 2016, to retrieve experiments and photograph the exterior portions of the Russian segment of the station. On March 1, 2016, Kelly transferred command of the ISS to Kopra, and returned to Earth alongside Korniyenko and Volkov aboard &quot;Soyuz TMA-18M&quot;. The spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan, and Kelly returned to Houston the following day.

In addition to the biological tests conducted on all astronauts on the station, Kelly also participated in comparative study on the effects of spaceflight with his identical twin Mark as the ground control subject. Kelly&#x27;s cognitive, and genetic traits were measured before and after the flight. Within several months after returning to Earth, Kelly had adapted to living in gravity. Genetic tests revealed changes in Kelly&#x27;s gene expression, and an increase in the length of his telomeres relative to before his flight.

== Post-NASA career ==
On March 12, 2016, Kelly announced his retirement from NASA, effective April 1, 2016. On November 20, 2016, Kelly was appointed United Nations Champion for Space by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), to assist in raising awareness of UNOOSA outreach and activities. In November 2017, a memoir by Kelly was released, called &quot;&quot;. On June 19, 2018, Kelly spoke at the UNISPACE50+ conference in Vienna, expressing his views on the possibilities of human potential:&quot;After spending a year in space, I was absolutely inspired that if we can dream it, we can do it...and most importantly, if we work as a team, because teamwork makes the dream work. The sky is not the limit.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On April 25, 1992, Kelly married for the first time, to Leslie (), whom he had met while stationed in Virginia Beach. Together, they have two children. Kelly and Leslie divorced in 2010. In July 2018, Kelly married Amiko Kauderer, a public affairs officer for NASA. His sister-in-law is Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona.

In 2007, Kelly was successfully treated for prostate cancer. After Kelly received his diagnosis, his brother Mark was also diagnosed and successfully treated.

== Charity ==
On October 27, 2022, Kelly became an ambassador for the UNITED24 project. In the project, Kelly will help the &quot;Medical Aid&quot; department to collect funds for C-class ambulances. Doctors need several hundred such vehicles, because many ambulances were destroyed during the Russian-Ukrainian war.

== Awards and honors ==

Kelly has received these awards and decorations:

Kelly received an honorary Korolev Diploma from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (1999) and an Honorary Doctorate of Science degree from the State University of New York (2008).

Korzun spent 196 days, 17 hours and 26 minutes on board Soyuz TM-24 and Mir.

The Expedition 5 crew was launched on 5 June 2002 aboard STS-111. lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center LC-39A at 21:22:49 UTC. After two days &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on 7 June 2002 at 16:25 UTC. Korzun joined the Expedition 5 crew as the commander. Expedition 5 crew carried out approximately 25 new investigations on board the ISS, as well as continued with various science investigations begun before their stay. The scientific investigations aimed at studying cold plasma, crystal growth, radiation effects in the space and the human body. Some medical experiments involved blood, muscles, bones while the crew also conducted psychological experiments. Korzun also participated in ecological experiments and monitored the Earth&#x27;s surface from space. Earth observation from outer space has many useful applications including informing the ground of disaster situations such as fires and floods as quickly as they occur.

The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth on December 7, 2002, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s STS-113 mission. The shuttle touched down at KSC Runway 33 at 19:38:25 UTC. Completing his second long duration spaceflight, Korzun logged 184 days and 22 hours in space.

===Spacewalks===

Korzun has performed four career spacewalks. During the Mir EO-22 mission he performed 2 spacewalks totaling 12 hours and 33 minutes. During ISS Expedition 5, he again performed two spacewalks totalling 9 hours and 46 minutes.

On 2 December 1996 Korzun performed his first career spacewalk with cosmonaut Aleksandr Kaleri. The main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the Mir station. The spacewalk started at 15:54 UTC and ended at 21:52 UTC lasting 5 hours and 57 minutes. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts installed MCSA cables.

Korzun performed his second career spacewalk on 9 December 1996. The main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the Mir station. He and Kaleri completed the MCSA cable installation and attached a Kurs docking antenna. The spacewalk started at 13:50 and ended at 20:28 lasting 6 hours and 38 minutes.

Korzun performed two spacewalks during his six-month stay aboard the ISS. On 16 August 2002 Korzun performed his third career spacewalk together with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson. The two spacewalkers got off to a late start because they evidently forgot to open an oxygen valve in their Russian Orlan spacesuits while getting prepared and the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock had to be repressurized. Once the valves were set correctly, Korzun reported a pressure leak but the Russian officials declared it as a no issue. By the time the hatch was finally opened almost two hours had been wasted and the spacewalk was cut short to a duration of 4.5 hours. The objective of the spacewalk was to fortify the ISS against damaging space debris. Korzun and Whitson installed six debris panels onto the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module. They removed the panels from their temporary location on the station&#x27;s PMA-1 prior to attachment to &quot;Zvezda&quot;. The panels are designed to shield &quot;Zvezda&quot; from potential space debris impacts. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 25 minutes.

Korzun performed his fourth career spacewalk on 26 August 2002. The start of the spacewalk was delayed because of an air leak in the sealed hatches between the Pirs airlock and the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The problem was easily corrected but took Korzun and Sergei Treshchov almost a half-hour to step through the procedures and get ready to go outside. Despite the late start at 05:27 UTC, the two spacewalkers finished everything assigned to them on this spacewalk. Wearing Russian Orlan spacesuits Korzun and Treshchov installed a frame on the outside of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module to house components for future spacewalk assembly tasks. They installed new material samples on a pair of Japanese Space Agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of &quot;Zvezda&quot;. They installed devices on &quot;Zvezda&quot; that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks. The two spacewalkers also improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on &quot;Zvezda&quot;. The spacewalk was staged from the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock and lasted 5 hours and 21 minutes.

<doc id="614924" wikidata="Q2689863" url="?curid=614924" title="1997 Welsh devolution referendum">
<text>The 1997 Welsh devolution referendum was a pre-legislative referendum held in Wales on 18 September 1997 over whether there was support for the creation of a National Assembly for Wales, and therefore a degree of self-government. The referendum was a Labour manifesto commitment and was held in their first term after the 1997 election under the provisions of the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997. This was the second referendum held in Wales over the question of devolution: the first referendum was held in 1979 and was defeated by a large majority.

The referendum resulted in a narrow majority in favour, which led to the passing of the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the formation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999.

==Background==
A referendum was held in 1979 (with a parallel referendum in Scotland) proposing the creation of a Welsh Assembly, under James Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government. The referendum stipulated that a Welsh Assembly would be created if supported by 50% of votes cast and 40% of the total electorate. The Scottish referendum achieved the first condition but not the second, while the Welsh referendum was defeated by almost a 4:1 majority. Indeed, although the Labour Party had committed itself to devolution in 1974 (following the advice of the Royal Commission on the Constitution) several Welsh Labour MPs (including Neil Kinnock) were very much opposed.

The 1979 referendum had been such a resounding defeat that it killed off any prospects of devolution in Wales for a generation. The almost wholly anti-devolution, unionist Conservative Party won the 1979 general election (though Welsh Labour remained the largest party in Wales, the Conservatives only won 11 out of 36 seats in Wales) and remained in government until 1997. Over this time, the Conservative Party became increasingly unpopular in Wales. The Conservatives mostly appointed English MPs representing English constituencies to the post of Secretary of State for Wales, including William Hague and John Redwood (who famously attempted to mime the words to the Welsh national anthem at the 1993 Welsh Conservative Party conference.)

A commitment to the creation of a Welsh Assembly with executive powers was again put into the Labour Party manifesto for the 1992 general election. The Labour Party shaped its policy of a Welsh Assembly under the guidance of Shadow Welsh Secretary Ron Davies and Welsh Office spokesmen Win Griffiths and Rhodri Morgan. In March 1996, Ron Davies signed an agreement with Alex Carlile, the Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, which committed both parties to support a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in a Welsh devolution referendum in the event of a Labour victory at the 1997 general election. The agreement was made in the context of a potential Lib-Lab pact should Labour not win an overall majority.

There was no inter-party Constitutional Convention in Wales to define devolution as there had been in Scotland. Labour&#x27;s initial proposal to elect a Welsh Assembly using the traditional first-past-the-post system was reversed in late-1996 in favour of the Additional Member System. This change was vital in order to gain the support of Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats in the event of a referendum.

==Referendum question==
Unusually for a referendum just as in the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum the electorate was asked to vote on two statements rather than a question which corresponded to the following proposal. The statements were issued both in English and Welsh.

Parliament has decided to consult people in Wales on the Government&#x27;s proposals for a Welsh Assembly:
Mae&#x27;r Senedd wedi penderfynu ymgynghori pobl yng Nghymru ar gynigion y Llywodraeth ar gyfer Cynulliad i Gymru:

;I agree there should be a Welsh Assembly
or
;I do not agree there should be a Welsh Assembly
(To be marked by a single (X))

== Campaign ==
The official Yes campaign, &quot;Yes for Wales&quot;, was supported by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, though they also ran their own individual campaigns. Labour anti-devolution MPs (including Llew Smith, among others) were subject to a tight parliamentary whip to ensure that the Labour Party was seen to be publicly behind the campaign. &quot;Yes for Wales&quot; placed a large emphasis on grassroots involvement in the campaign, with sectoral groups such as &quot;Pensioners say Yes&quot;, and local branches throughout Wales.

Prominent campaigners for a Yes vote included Labour politicians Leighton Andrews, Ron Davies, Alun Michael, Rhodri Morgan, Andrew Davies, Peter Hain, Hywel Francis, Edwina Hart and Val Feld; Liberal Democrat politicians Michael German, Jenny Randerson, Kirsty Williams and Peter Black; Plaid Cymru politicians Dafydd Wigley, Cynog Dafis Ieuan Wyn Jones and Leanne Wood; and academic Russell Deacon.

The official No campaign, &quot;Just Say NO&quot;, was chaired by Nick Bourne, then-Conservative &quot;Chief Spokesman in Wales&quot;. The No campaign lacked the structure and finance of the Yes campaign, and suffered from the fact that the Conservatives&#x27; landslide defeat at the 1997 general election meant there were no Conservative MPs (and therefore no MPs supporting the No campaign) in Wales. Additionally, the No campaign in 1997 did not have the support of local authorities; the fact that the Conservatives had reduced layers of local government from two to one in 1994 meant that this was not an issue as it had been in 1979.

==Result==
Note: In Wales under the Welsh Language Act 1993 the Welsh language has equal status with the English language.

The overall result was declared in the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff. The proceeding officer was Professor Eric Sunderland. The results of all 22 local authority areas were announced individually, and the result was close enough that everything in fact hung on the announcement from Carmarthenshire, which carried the Yes vote. The difference between the &#x27;agree&#x27; and &#x27;disagree&#x27; vote was 6,721.

<text>An infielder is a baseball player stationed at one of four defensive &quot;infield&quot; positions on the baseball field, between first base and third base.

==Standard arrangement of positions==
In a game of baseball, two teams of nine players take turns playing offensive and defensive roles. Although there are many rules to baseball, in general the team playing offense tries to score runs by batting balls into the field that enable runners to make a complete circuit of the four bases. The team playing in the field tries to prevent runs by catching the ball before it hits the ground, by tagging runners with the ball while they are not touching a base, or by throwing the ball to first base before the batter who hit the ball can run from home plate to first base.

There are nine defensive positions on a baseball field. The part of the baseball field closest to the batter (shown in the diagram as light brown) is known as the &quot;infield&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;outfield&quot;, the part of the field furthest from the batter, shown in the diagram as green.)

==Positions==
The infield is composed of four positions: first base (1B), second base (2B), third base (3B) and shortstop (SS). Generally, the first three have responsibility for plays at their respective bases, although the shortstop often shares responsibility for second base with the second baseman. Each position requires a different set of skills. A player who lacks the offensive or defensive skills needed to be a member of the starting lineup, but who has the various skills needed to play two or more infield positions competently and therefore can be called upon to come off the bench and fill a variety of defensive roles is called a utility infielder.

==Roles==
===Middle infielders===
The second baseman and the shortstop are the middle infielders. The second baseman tries to field balls hit between first and second base. The shortstop does the same between second and third base. Once fielded, the balls must be thrown to the first baseman before the batter can reach first base. This requires speed to get to hit balls before they pass beyond reach, dexterity to successfully field the balls, and agility to field the balls in a position that will allow a strong throw to first base. Second basemen and shortstops also share responsibility for tagging runners who are attempting to steal second base. Because a shortstop has a longer throw to make to first base, he must reach the ball faster and throw harder than the second baseman. For this reason, the shortstop must have the best fielding skills of any infielder. Because of the spectrum of skills required by a middle infielder, emphasis is usually put on defensive skills rather than offensive ability—good defensive skills and a mediocre bat are often considered more important than a good bat and poor defensive skills.

===Corner infielders===
The first baseman and the third baseman are the corner infielders.

The third baseman primarily fields balls hit and bunted down the third base line, but can also attempt to reach balls hit between second and third base. Although the third baseman does not need to cover as great a range as the shortstop or second baseman, the position requires greater anticipation and quicker reflexes, since the third baseman may be standing only 90 feet from the batter and sometimes much less; thus, he has much less time to react to hit balls than the shortstop or second baseman. The third baseman must also have a strong arm since the throw from his position to first base is the longest on the infield.

The first baseman is largely responsible for keeping one foot on first base while catching throws from the other three infielders before the batter can reach first base. These throws are often hurried and thus off-target. A player who is tall and has long arms may be a good candidate for first baseman because these attributes help him handle off-target throws. The first baseman must be able to cleanly field thrown balls that hit the ground before they reach first base, and to quickly decide to abandon first when necessary to catch an especially bad throw. Since the first baseman mostly stands close to his base, his mobility and throwing skills do not need to be high; good hitters who are slow of foot are often placed at first base. In some cases, an aging third baseman or outfielder who has lost some speed but is still a good hitter will be moved to first base to keep his bat in the line-up.

<text>Sergei Konstantinovich Krikalev (, also transliterated as Sergei Krikalyov; born 27 August 1958) is a Russian mechanical engineer and former cosmonaut and head of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.

As a prominent rocket scientist, he is a veteran of six space flights and ranks fourth to Oleg Kononenko, Gennady Padalka, and Yuri Malenchenko for the most time spent in space: a total of 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 minutes.

Krikalev was stranded on board the Mir during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As the country that had sent him into space no longer existed, his return was delayed and he stayed in space for 311 consecutive days, twice as long as the mission had originally called for.

He retired as a cosmonaut in 2007 and was working as vice president of Space Corporation Energia. From 2009 to 2014, he headed the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.

== Biography ==
Krikalev was born in Leningrad in the Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). He enjoyed swimming, skiing, cycling, aerobatic flying, and amateur radio operations, particularly from space (callsign U5MIR). He graduated from high school in 1975. In 1981, he received a mechanical engineering degree from the Leningrad Mechanical Institute, now called Baltic State Technical University.

After graduation in 1981, he joined NPO Energia, the Russian industrial organization responsible for crewed space flight activities. He tested space flight equipment, developed space operations methods, and participated in ground control operations. When the Salyut 7 space station failed in 1985, he worked on the rescue mission team, developing procedures for docking with the uncontrolled station and repairing the station&#x27;s on-board system.

=== Mir ===
Krikalev was selected as a cosmonaut in 1985, completed his basic training in 1986, and, for a time, was assigned to the Buran Shuttle program. In early 1988, he began training for his first long-duration flight aboard the Mir space station.

This training included preparations for at least six EVAs (space walks), installation of a new module, the first test of the new Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and the second joint Soviet-French science mission. Soyuz TM-7 was launched on 26 November 1988, with Krikalev as flight engineer, Commander Aleksandr Volkov, and French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien. The previous crew (Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, and Valeri Polyakov) remained on Mir for another 25 days, marking the longest period a six-person crew had been in orbit. After the previous crew returned to Earth, Krikalev, Polyakov, and Volkov continued to conduct experiments aboard the Mir station. Because the arrival of the next crew had been delayed, they prepared the Mir for a period of uncrewed operations before returning to Earth on 27 April 1989.

In April 1990, Krikalev began preparing for his second flight as a member of the backup crew for the eighth long-duration Mir mission, which also included five EVAs and a week of Soviet-Japanese operations. In December 1990, Krikalev began training for the ninth Mir mission which included training for ten EVAs. Soyuz TM-12 launched on 19 May 1991, with Krikalev as flight engineer, Commander Anatoly Artsebarsky, and British astronaut Helen Sharman. Sharman returned to Earth with the previous crew after one week, while Krikalev and Artsebarsky remained on Mir. During the summer, they conducted six EVAs to perform a variety of experiments and some station maintenance tasks.

In July 1991, Krikalev agreed to stay on Mir as flight engineer for the next crew, scheduled to arrive in October because the next two planned flights had been reduced to one. The engineer slot on the Soyuz TM-13 flight on 2 October 1991, was filled by Toktar Aubakirov, an astronaut from the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, who had not been trained for a long-duration mission. Both Aubakirov and Franz Viehböck, the first Austrian astronaut, returned with Artsebarsky on 10 October 1991. Commander Alexander Volkov remained on board with Krikalev. After the crew replacement in October, Volkov and Krikalev continued Mir experiment operations and conducted another EVA before returning to Earth on 25 March 1992.

Throughout his various missions aboard Mir, Krikalev regularly communicated with various amateur radio operators (hams) across the globe. A particularly lengthy relationship was formed between Krikalev and amateur radio operator Margaret Iaquinto. At one point during one of his stays in space, he contacted her once a day for an entire year. Krikalev and Iaquinto successfully communicated via packet radio for the first time in history between an orbiting space station and an amateur radio operator. They communicated about personal matters, as well as political ones. Iaquinto set up a makeshift digital bulletin board that the Mir cosmonauts would often use to obtain uncensored western news and information regarding the state of the collapsing Soviet Union.

Krikalev was in space when the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991. With the Baikonur Cosmodrome and the landing area both being located in the newly independent Kazakhstan, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the fate of his mission. He remained in space twice as long as originally planned, spending a total of 311 days in space. Because Krikalev spent so much time in space traveling at high velocities, time dilation (or the slowing down of clocks) caused him to be 0.02 seconds younger than other people born at the same time as him. He returned to Earth on 25 March and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;last Soviet citizen&quot;. These events are documented and contextualized in Romanian filmmaker Andrei Ujică&#x27;s 1995 documentary &quot;Out of the Present&quot;. Krikalev&#x27;s story inspired the 2017 film &quot;Sergio and Sergei&quot;, directed by Ernesto Daranas.

=== Space Shuttle ===

In October 1992, NASA announced that an experienced cosmonaut would fly aboard a future Space Shuttle mission. Krikalev was one of two candidates named by the Russian Space Agency for mission specialist training with the crew of STS-60. In April 1993, he was assigned as prime mission specialist. In September 1993, Vladimir Titov was selected to fly on STS-63 with Krikalev training as his backup.

Krikalev flew on STS-60, the first joint U.S./Russian Space Shuttle Mission. Launched on 3 February 1994, STS-60 was the second flight of the Space Habitation Module-2 (Spacehab-2), and the first flight of the Wake Shield Facility (WSF-1). During the eight-day flight, the crew of &quot;Discovery&quot; conducted a wide variety of materials science experiments, both on the Wake Shield Facility and in the Spacehab, Earth observation, and life science experiments. Krikalev conducted significant portions of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) operations during the flight. Following 130 orbits of the Earth in , STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 11 February 1994. With the completion of this flight, Krikalev logged an additional eight days, seven hours, nine minutes in space.

Krikalev returned to duty in Russia following his American experience on STS-60. Periodically he returned to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to work with CAPCOM in Mission Control and ground controllers in Russia supporting joint U.S./Russian Missions STS-63, STS-71, STS-74 and STS-76.

Krikalev and Robert Cabana became the first people to enter the ISS in December 1998, when they turned on the lights in the US module &quot;Unity&quot;.

Krikalev flew on STS-88 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (4–15 December 1998), the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the 12-day mission the &quot;Unity&quot; module was mated with &quot;Zarya&quot; module. Two crew members performed three space walks to connect umbilicals and attach tools and hardware for use in future EVAs. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1 and SAC-A. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

=== International Space Station ===
Krikalev was a member of the Expedition 1 crew. They launched 31 October 2000, on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, successfully docking with the station on 2 November 2000. During their stay on the station, they prepared the inside of the orbital outpost for future crews. They also saw the station grow in size with the installation of the U.S. solar array structure and the U.S. &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module. They left the station with the STS-102 crew, undocking from the station on 18 March with landing at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 21 March 2001.

Krikalev was also the commander of Expedition 11. He lived and worked aboard the International Space Station on a six-month tour of duty. This was the third time he had flown to the International Space Station. Expedition 11 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 April 2005 aboard a Soyuz spacecraft and docked with the ISS on 16 April 2005. Following eight days of joint operations and handover briefings, they replaced the Expedition 10 crew who returned to earth aboard Soyuz. Expedition 11 plans called for two spacewalks, the first in August from the US &quot;Quest&quot; airlock in US spacesuits, and the second, in September, in Russian spacesuits from the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. On 16 August 2005 at 1:44 a.m. EDT he passed the record of 748 days in space held by Sergei Avdeyev.

Expedition 11 undocked from the ISS on 10 October 2005 at 5:49 p.m. EDT and landed in Kazakhstan on 10 October 2005 at 9:09 p.m. EDT. They were replaced by William S. McArthur and Valeri Tokarev, the crew of Expedition 12.

In completing his sixth space flight, Krikalev logged 803 days and 9 hours and 39 minutes in space, including eight EVAs. He is currently fourth to Gennady Padalka, Oleg Kononenko and Yuri Malenchenko in the record for the most time spent in space.

Krikalev&#x27;s contributions to the ISS were not limited to his on-orbit time. On 15 June 2007, Krikalev was brought to the Russian Mission Control center to instruct Expedition 15 Flight Engineer Oleg Kotov on how he and ISS Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin could jump-start the Russian segment&#x27;s crippled computer systems.

=== Later career ===
On 15 February 2007, Krikalev was appointed Vice President of the S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (Russian: Ракетно-космическая корпорация &quot;Энергия&quot; им. С.П.Королева) in charge of crewed space flights. In that office, he was the administrator of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center from 2009 to 2014.

=== In popular culture ===
A character based on Krikalev features in the 2017 Cuban film drama &quot;Sergio and Sergei&quot;, in which a professor and amateur radio enthusiast in Havana contacts a cosmonaut named Sergei aboard the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. The film draws parallels between economic hardships in Cuba at the time and the fall of the Soviet Union, which occurred as the real-life Krikalev was aboard &quot;Mir&quot;.

Chilean rock band &quot;Fulano&quot; composed a song after him, named Krikalev, included in their 1997 album &quot;Trabajos Inútiles&quot; (Useless works).

Finnish rock band YUP has a song called &quot;Tuuliajolla&quot; (Adrift) from their album &quot;Outo Elämä&quot; (Strange life) inspired by the Krikalev&#x27;s incident.

== Public activities==
From 1999 to 2007, Krikalev was President of the Russian Gliding Federation.

On 14 February 2012, Krikalev was approved as a member of the Public Chamber of the Central Federal District and a confidant of the Prime Minister and presidential candidate Vladimir Putin, and at the first plenary meeting on 14 September of the same year, he was elected Secretary of the Chamber.

On 12 April 2014, Krikalev was appointed Plenipotentiary Representative of the Governor of Sevastopol in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In September 2016, Krikalev became a confidant of the United Russia party in the elections to the State Duma of the 7th Convocation.

Since 2017, Krikalev has been the President of the Aircraft Sports Federation of Russia. On 16 December 2017, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, he became the Ambassador of the WorldSkills Kazan 2019 Championship.

In January 2018, Krikalev became a confidant of Vladimir Putin in the upcoming presidential elections on 18 March 2018.

Krikalev is a member of the Expert Council of the National Prize &quot;Crystal Compass&quot; and President of the International Environmental Foundation &quot;Clean Seas&quot; (since 2009).

<text>Michael A. Slote is a professor of ethics at the University of Miami and an author of a number of books. 

He was previously professor of philosophy at the University of Maryland, and at Trinity College Dublin. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University.

He argues that virtue ethics, in a particular form which draws on the concept of an ethics of care, offers significant intuitive and structural advantages over deontology, utilitarianism, and common-sense morality. He has also recently endorsed the meta-ethical view of moral sentimentalism in opposition to moral rationalism (see his articles from 2003, 2004, 2005a and his books (2007 and 2010)). 

Most recently he expanded his work on sentimentalism into a philosophy of mind (book 2014). In his latest work he also stresses the importance of receptivity as a virtue, a value and as a psychological characteristic (article 2014 and book 2013). The significance of receptivity feature was first considered by Nel Noddings in 1984, but did not receive further attention in the ethics of care neither was it used to criticize typical Western philosophical values. In &quot;The Impossibility of Perfection&quot;, he argues against moral perfection as it was endorsed by Aristotle and the Enlightenment and defends a more realistic view of moral issues.

<doc id="614933" wikidata="Q1335536" url="?curid=614933" title="Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)">
<text>Alexander James Dallas (June 21, 1759 – January 16, 1817) was an American statesman who served as the 6th United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1814 to 1816 under President James Madison.

==Early life==
Dallas was born in Kingston, Jamaica, to Robert Charles Dallas, Sr. and Sarah Elizabeth (Cormack) Hewitt. His brother was Robert Charles Dallas, who wrote a history of the Jamaican Maroons. Dr Dallas bought the Boar Castle estate on the Cane River, Jamaica in 1758, changing its name to Dallas Castle. This property included 900 acres and 91 slaves. Dallas left the island in 1764, having mortgaged the estate and put it in a trust.

When Alexander was five, his family moved to Edinburgh and then to London. There he studied under James Elphinston, a Scottish educator and linguist. He planned to study law, but was unable to afford it. In 1780, Alexander married Arabella Maria Smith (1761–1837) of Pennsylvania. Arabella came from a family lineage with prominent connections to the British military as the daughter of Major George Smith of the British Army and Arabella Barlow, and a great-granddaughter of Sir Nicholas Trevanion, by way of Reverend William Barlow and Arabella Trevanion. In 1781, they moved to Jamaica. There, Alexander was admitted to the bar through his father&#x27;s connections. However, Maria&#x27;s health suffered in Jamaica, and they subsequently moved to Philadelphia in 1783, where he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1785. To supplement his budding law practice, he also took side jobs editing the &quot;Pennsylvania Herald&quot; from 1787 to 1788 and the &quot;Columbian Magazine&quot; from 1787 to 1789.
==U.S. Supreme Court Reporter==
Dallas published the second set of state court reports (Ephraim Kirby was first with &quot;Connecticut Reports&quot;) entitled &quot;Reports of Cases Ruled and Adjudged in the Courts of Pennsylvania Before and Since the Revolution&quot; in 1790 containing cases from 1754 to 1789. He then published three succeeding volumes under the title, &quot;Reports of Cases Ruled and Adjudged in the Several Courts of the United States, and of Pennsylvania, Held at the Seat of the Federal Government&quot; (1797, 1799, 1806). As the first reporter for Pennsylvania and United States Supreme Court reporter of decisions, these volumes began the series of both state and federal reports. These early reports are considered unofficial because Dallas carried out his work publishing the official &quot;United States Reports&quot; volumes from his own funds. The first Supreme Court case reported was &quot;West v. Barnes&quot;, 2 U.S. (Dall.) 401 (1791), and it was shortened so that it did not include the full seriatim opinions of the justices. The volumes of reports, of which he produced only four, were faulted for being incomplete, inaccurate, and extremely tardy. The landmark ruling in &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; (1793) which prompted the Eleventh Amendment, was not reported by Dallas until five years later, well after the Amendment had been ratified. Later, he wrote: &quot;I have found such miserable encouragement for my reports that I have determined to call them all in, and devote them to the rats in the State-House.&quot; But his publications still serve as an important legal milestone in American legal publishing. He was a founder of the Democratic-Republican Societies in 1793.

==Secretary of the Commonwealth==
Governor Thomas Mifflin named Dallas Secretary of the Commonwealth, a post he held from 1791 to 1801. Because Mifflin was an alcoholic, Dallas functioned as de facto governor for much of the late 1790s. Dallas helped found the Democratic-Republican party in Pennsylvania and advocated a strict construction of the new Constitution.

In 1798, Dallas represented Patrick Lyon, who was falsely accused in the 1798 Bank of Pennsylvania heist.

==U.S. Attorney and Secretary of the Treasury==

In 1801, he was named United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and served in that capacity until 1814. His friend Albert Gallatin was Treasury Secretary when the War of 1812 began and Dallas helped Gallatin obtain funds to fight Britain. The war nearly bankrupted the federal government by the time Dallas replaced Gallatin as Treasury Secretary. Dallas reorganized the Treasury Department, brought the government budget back into surplus, championed the creation of the Second Bank of the United States, and put the nation back on the specie system based on gold and silver.

==Acting Secretary of War and Acting Secretary of State==
From March 2, 1815, to August 1, 1815, he was acting United States Secretary of War and for a time that year was also acting United States Secretary of State. He returned to Philadelphia, but lived only a year.

He was a member of the American Philosophical Society from 1791 and a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania.

==Honors==
Dallas County, Alabama, and Dallas Township, Pennsylvania, are named for him. Six U.S. Coast Guard Cutters have been named &quot;Dallas&quot;, the most recent was USCGC &quot;Dallas&quot; (WHEC-716). Fort Dallas in Florida and the U.S. Navy ship USS &quot;Dallas&quot; (DD-199) were named after his son, Alexander J. Dallas, who died during his Navy service.

His other son George Mifflin Dallas was Vice President under James K. Polk and one possible namesake for Dallas, Texas; his father and brother are other possible namesakes of the Texas city.

His daughter, Sophia Burrell Dallas, married on April 4, 1805 Richard Bache, Jr., the son of Richard Bache, Sr. and Sarah Franklin Bache. Her husband&#x27;s father was a marine insurance underwriter and importer in Philadelphia who served as United States Postmaster General from 1776 to 1782. Her husband&#x27;s mother, known as Sally, was the only daughter of Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, and his common-law wife, Deborah Read.

Dallas was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1791.

<text>Erin Patria Margaret Pizzey (; born 19 February 1939) is a British activist and novelist known for her advocacy on behalf of both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rights and for her work against domestic violence. She is recognized for founding the world&#x27;s first and largest domestic violence shelter in the world, Refuge, then known as Chiswick Women&#x27;s Aid, in 1971.

Pizzey says that she has been the subject of death threats and boycotts because her experience and research into the issue led her to conclude that most domestic violence is reciprocal, and that women are as capable of violence as men. These threats eventually led to her exile from the UK. Pizzey has said that the threats were from militant feminists. She has also stated that she is banned from the refuge she started.

==Early life==
She was born Erin Carney in Qingdao, China, in 1939, along with her twin sister Rosaleen. Her father was a British diplomat and one of 17 children from a poor Irish family.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990/911990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, the family moved to Shanghai; shortly thereafter, they were captured by the invading Japanese Army and exchanged for Japanese prisoners of war. She is the sister of writer Daniel Carney, who settled in Rhodesia and is known for his 1978 novel &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;.

Pizzey moved with her family to Kokstad in South Africa, then at the age of five, to Beirut. At the end of the war the family went to Toronto, Canada. They moved to Tehran, Iran, and finally settled in England in 1948. Pizzey attended St Antony&#x27;s junior school and then Leweston School at the age of 11, gaining four O-levels. Her parents were posted to Africa, where she attended Dakar University, Senegal, studying French and English.

==Overview==

=== Early activism ===
In 1959, Pizzey attended her first meeting at the UK&#x27;s Liberation Movement (WLM) at the Chiswick house of a local organiser, Artemis At Artemis&#x27; urging, Pizzey agreed to convene a &quot;consciousness-raising group&quot; at her home in Goldhawk Road. This collective became the Goldhawk Road Group.

The head office of the Women&#x27;s Liberation Workshop (a women&#x27;s workshop within the WLM) was in Little Newport Street, in Chinatown, Covent Garden, straddling the City of Westminster and the Borough of Camden. Along with her friend, Alison, and other members of the Goldhawk Road Group, Pizzey found herself at odds with Artemis and Gladiator, who led a clique of younger women within the WLM Workshop head office. Pizzey distanced herself from this clique when she witnessed what she described as &quot;irregular and disrespectful behaviour&quot; towards the money donated by desperate women across the UK. She confronted them over this behaviour, which, according to her, included claiming that telephones were tapped, and labelling of people they did not like as MI5, police and CIA informers or agents. She also was concerned about overhearing discussion of plans to bomb the London store Biba; she reported on this to the police after warning the people involved. Subsequently, Pizzey became aware that the police had the group and offices under surveillance. Pizzey says that she and her fellow members of the Goldhawk Road group were seen as troublesome, because they did not accept others&#x27; behaviors and views.

=== Refuge ===
Pizzey set up a women&#x27;s refuge in Belmont Terrace, Chiswick, London, in 1971. She later opened a number of additional shelters, despite hostility from the authorities. She gained notoriety and publicity for setting up refuges by squatting, most notably in 1975 at the Palm Court Hotel in Richmond. Pizzey&#x27;s work was widely praised at the time. In 1975, MP Jack Ashley stated in the House of Commons that &quot;The work of Mrs. Pizzey was pioneering work of the first order. It was she who first identified the problem, who first recognised the seriousness of the situation and who first did something practical by establishing the Chiswick aid centre. As a result of that magnificent pioneering work, the whole nation has now come to appreciate the significance of the problem&quot;. While being prosecuted by local authorities and appealing matters to the House of Lords, she was recognised for her work.

After Pizzey left Chiswick Women&#x27;s Aid (renamed Chiswick Family Rescue on 31 March 1979), the organisation she had founded and moved abroad, it was rebranded as the charity Refuge on 5 March 1993. Although Refuge traces its existence back to Chiswick Women&#x27;s Aid, Pizzey&#x27;s name could not be found anywhere on the Refuge website for many decades. It was not until 2 November 2020 that Sandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge since 1983, mentioned Pizzey&#x27;s name for the first time again on the Refuge website in a press release on her retirement.

=== Reciprocity of domestic violence ===
Soon after establishing her first refuge, Pizzey asserted that much of the domestic violence was reciprocal. She reached this conclusion when she asked the women in her refuge about their violence, only to discover most of them were equally violent or more violent than their husbands. In her study &quot;Comparative Study of Battered Women And Violence-Prone Women&quot;, (co-researched with John Gayford of Warlingham Hospital), Pizzey distinguished between &quot;genuine battered women&quot; and &quot;violence-prone women&quot;; the former defined as &quot;the unwilling and innocent victim of his or her partner&#x27;s violence&quot; and the latter defined as &quot;the unwilling victim of his or her own violence&quot;. This study reported that 62% of the sample population were more accurately described as &quot;violence prone&quot;. Similar findings regarding the mutuality of domestic violence have been confirmed in subsequent studies.

In her book &quot;Prone to Violence&quot;, Pizzey expressed concern that so little attention was paid to the causes of interpersonal and family violence, stating, &quot;to my amazement, nobody seemed to genuinely want to find out why violent people treat each other the way they do&quot;. She also expressed concern for the view expressed by government officials that solutions to the issue of domestic abuse and violence could be found in socialist or communist countries. Pizzey pointed out that marital violence was a great problem in Russia, and China addressed the issue by proclaiming wife-beating a crime punishable by death sentence. The book looks at what appeared to be learned behaviour, often starting in childhood, linked to hormonal responses. Pizzey describes such behaviour as akin to addiction.

She speculates that high levels of hormones and neurochemicals associated with pervasive childhood trauma led to adults who repeatedly engage in violent altercations with intimate partners despite the physical, emotional, legal and financial costs, in unwitting attempts to simulate the emotional impact of traumatic childhood experiences and manifest the learned biochemical state linked to pleasure. The book contains numerous stories of disturbed families, alongside a discussion of the reasons why the modern state care-taking agencies are largely ineffective. Promotional events for the book were met with protest, and Pizzey reports that she herself and co-author Jeff Shapiro needed police protection during the promotional events for the book.

=== Backlash, threats, and harassment ===
In 1981, Pizzey moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, while targeted by harassment, death threats, bomb threats and defamation campaigns, and dealing with overwork, near collapse, cardiac disease and mental strain. In particular, according to Pizzey, the charity Scottish Women&#x27;s Aid &quot;made it their business to hand out leaflets claiming that [she] believed that women &#x27;invited violence&#x27; and &#x27;provoked male violence&#x27;&quot;. She states that the turning point was the intervention of the bomb squad, who required all of her mail to be processed by them before she could receive it, as a &quot;controversial public figure.&quot;

Having moved to Santa Fe to write, Pizzey promptly became involved in running a refuge in New Mexico, as well as dealing with sexual abusers and paedophiles. Pizzey said of this work, &quot;I discovered that there were just as many women paedophiles as there were men. Women go undetected, as usual. Working against paedophiles is a very dangerous business.&quot; While she was living in Santa Fe, one of her dogs was shot and two others were stolen, which she claims was a result of racist neighbours. Her family suffered new harassment following the publication of her 1982 book &quot;Prone to Violence&quot;. Pizzey links much of the harassment to militant feminists and their objections to her research, findings and work. Describing the harassment, Deborah Ross of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that &quot;the feminist sisterhood went bonkers&quot;.

Following the abuse and threats in Santa Fe, Pizzey moved to Cayman Brac, Cayman Islands, where she wrote with her second husband, Jeff Shapiro. Subsequently, she moved to Siena, Italy, where her writing and advocacy work continued. She returned to London in the spring of 1997, homeless due to debt and in increasingly poor health. Her insights are still sought by politicians and family pressure groups.

==Later work==
Pizzey is still active in helping victims of domestic violence. She has been a patron of the charity ManKind Initiative since 2004, when she received a Roger Witcomb Award. In March 2007, as a guest, she attended the ceremony of opening the first Arab refuge for victims of domestic violence in Bahrain.

In 2013, Pizzey joined the editorial and advisory board of the men&#x27;s rights organisation A Voice for Men, serving as an Editor and DV Policy Advisor and from January to August wrote thirteen articles for the group&#x27;s web site. Her two April 2013 articles pertained to two interviews she gave on the Reddit community &quot;IAmA&quot;, in which she promoted her Facebook page, and the &quot;AVFM Online Radio&quot; podcast on BlogTalkRadio. She announced her first interview a week prior on /r/MensRights.

In November 2014, Pizzey became owner/manager of the AVFM WhiteRibbon.org website (since renamed Honest-Ribbon.org), which has been criticised by the original White Ribbon Campaign as &quot;a copycat campaign articulating ... archaic views and denials about the realities of gender-based violence&quot;.

Pizzey was interviewed for and appeared in the 2016 documentary film &quot;The Red Pill&quot; by Cassie Jaye about the men&#x27;s rights movement. Pizzey is a patron of registered charity Compassion In Care which works to &quot;break the chain of elderly abuse&quot; and she wrote an introduction for the book &quot;Beyond The Facade&quot; by founder Eileen Chubb. In 2022, Pizzey was listed as Honorary Lifetime President Emeritus to CPU: Children Parents United Charity founded by Greg Ellis. The charity appears to be shut down as of April 2023.

== Libel case ==
In 2009, Pizzey was successful in a libel case against Macmillan Publishers over content in the Andrew Marr book &quot;A History of Modern Britain&quot;. The publication had falsely claimed she had once been part of a militant group, The Angry Brigade, that staged bomb attacks in the 1970s. The publisher also recalled and destroyed the offending version of the book and republished it with the error removed. The link to the Angry Brigade was made in 2001, in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in which the article states that she was &quot;thrown out&quot; of the feminist movement after threatening to inform police about a planned bombing by the Angry Brigade of the clothes shop Biba. &quot;I said that if you go on with this – they were discussing bombing Biba [the legendary department store in Kensington] – I&#x27;m going to call the police in, because I really don&#x27;t believe in this&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pizzey married Jack Pizzey in 1959. Jack Pizzey was a naval lieutenant whom she first met in Hong Kong. They had two children, a girl, Cleo, and a boy, Amos. She divorced him in 1976, and divorced her second husband, Jeff Scott Shapiro, in 1994. Pizzey lives in Twickenham, South West London. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2000.

In 2000, Pizzey&#x27;s grandson Keita Craig, who had schizophrenia, hanged himself in a prison cell. Pizzey and her family campaigned against the coroner&#x27;s verdict of death by hanging and in 2001 a jury at a second inquest unanimously found that Keita&#x27;s death was contributed to by the neglect of prison staff. The case was the first to reach a verdict of neglect in a suicide case.

Pizzey was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to the victims of domestic abuse.

<text>Mark Charles Lee USAF Colonel, (born August 14, 1952) is a former NASA astronaut who flew on four Space Shuttle missions. He retired from the Air Force and NASA on July 1, 2001.

==Early life==
Lee was born August 14, 1952, in Viroqua, Wisconsin, and graduated from Viroqua High School in 1970. Lee is an Eagle Scout. He later attended the United States Air Force Academy, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering in 1974. Following pilot training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and F-4 Phantom II upgrade at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, Lee spent years at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, flying F-4&#x27;s in the 25th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In 1979, after this assignment, he studied for a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he specialized in graphite/epoxy advanced composite materials.

After graduation from MIT in 1980, he was assigned to Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Program Office, as the operational support manager. His responsibilities included resolving mechanical and material deficiencies which affected the mission readiness of the AWACS aircraft. In 1982 he returned to flying, upgrading in the F-16 and serving as executive officer for the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing Deputy Commander for Operations, and as flight commander in the 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, until his selection as an astronaut candidate.

==Astronaut career==
Lee was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1984. In June 1985, he completed a one-year training and evaluation program, qualifying him for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His technical responsibilities within the Astronaut Office included extravehicular activity (EVA), the Inertial Upper Stage, Spacelab, and Space Station systems. Lee also served as a spacecraft communicator in the Mission Control Center, as Lead Astronaut Support Person at the Kennedy Space Center, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, Chief of the EVA Robotics Branch, and Chief of the EVA Branch. He also worked Space Station assembly issues for the Astronaut Office.

In total, during his four space flights, Lee traveled over 13 million miles going around the world 517 times and spending 33 days in orbit. Lee&#x27;s first shuttle mission was as a mission specialist on STS-30 (May 4–8, 1989). This mission involved the launch of the Magellan probe, a Venus-exploration spacecraft and experiments involving life sciences and crystals.

In his second flight, mission STS-47, running from September 12–20, 1992, Lee was payload commander with overall crew responsibility for the planning, integration, and on-orbit coordination of payload/Space Shuttle activities. This cooperative mission between the United States and Japan included 44 Japanese and U.S. life science and materials processing experiments and the shuttle carried Spacelab-J. Lee also initiated a unique distinction with STS-47: his wife at that time, Jan Davis, was a mission specialist on the flight, making Lee and Davis the first married couple to be in space at the same time. Lee and Davis had met during training for the flight and had married in secret. They disclosed their marriage to NASA shortly before the flight, when it was too late to train a substitute. NASA has since changed the rules and will not allow married astronauts on the same flight.

Lee was a mission specialist on his third flight, mission STS-64, running from September 9–20, 1994. During this flight, he logged 6 hours and 51 minutes of EVA to test a self-rescue jetpack, undertook the first untethered spacewalk in 10 years and deployed and retrieved a solar science satellite. Lee&#x27;s final flight was STS-82, running from February 11–21, 1997. This was the second Hubble Space Telescope maintenance mission and Lee again served as payload commander. He was a member of one of two spacewalk teams who installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments, as well as replacing insulation patches over three compartments containing key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. Lee&#x27;s contribution amounted to three spacewalks totaling 19 hours and 10 minutes of EVA.

Lee was scheduled to fly another mission to the International Space Station in 2000, but was replaced by Robert Curbeam for &quot;undisclosed reasons&quot; which news reports claimed related to a falling-out with &quot;at least one of his superiors at the NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center&quot;. Lee asked for the decision to be reconsidered, but was not reinstated. He retired from NASA in 2001.

==Personal life==
Lee married fellow astronaut Jan Davis in January 1991. They were the first married couple to fly together in space, joined in 2022 by Sharon and Marc Hagle on Blue Origin&#x27;s NS-20. They divorced in 1999. 

He subsequently married former Paula Marie Simon. They have three boys. In early 2006 Lee&#x27;s family reunited with his birth grandmother, 77 years after his mother had been placed for adoption.

==Medals and honors==
Lee has been awarded a number of medals and honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal. He has also received two Air Force Commendation Medals, four NASA Space Flight Medals, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, the NASA Public Service Group Achievement Award, and two NASA Exceptional Service Medals.

<text>Duck Creek is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately 30 mi (50 km) long, in southeastern Ohio in the United States. Via the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. It drains an area of the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, between the watersheds of the Muskingum and Little Muskingum Rivers.

==Course==
Duck Creek is formed in the hill country of northern Washington County at the community of Warner, just west of Lower Salem and approximately 15 mi (24 km) north of Marietta, by the confluence of East Fork Duck Creek and West Fork Duck Creek. The East Fork, approximately 20 mi (30 km) long, rises in western Monroe County and flows generally southwardly through eastern Noble and northern Washington Counties. The West Fork, approximately 30 mi (50 km) long, rises in southeastern Guernsey County and flows generally south-southeastwardly through central Noble and northern Washington Counties, past the towns of Belle Valley, Caldwell, Dexter City and Macksburg; it is the larger of the two headwaters streams. From Warner, Duck Creek flows generally southwardly in a highly meandering course and joins the Ohio River at Marietta, about 3 mi (5 km) east of its downtown.

<doc id="614945" wikidata="Q2745501" url="?curid=614945" title="Member states of the League of Nations">
<text>Between 1920 and 1946, a total of 63 countries became member states of the League of Nations.

When the Assembly of the League of Nations first met, it consisted of 42 founding members. A further 21 countries joined between then and the dissolution of the League.

As several countries withdrew from the League during the course of its existence, the 63 countries were never all members at the same time. The League&#x27;s greatest extent was from 28 September 1934 (when Ecuador joined) to February 1935 (when Paraguay withdrew) with 58 countries. At this time, only Costa Rica (December 1924), Brazil (June 1926), Japan (March 1933), and Germany (October 1933) had withdrawn, and only Egypt joined later (on 26 May 1937).

==Founding members==
The Covenant of the League of Nations was part of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919 between the Allies of World War I and Germany. In order for the treaty to enter into force, it had to be deposited at Paris; in order to be deposited, it had to be ratified by Germany and any three of the five Principal Powers (the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy, and the Empire of Japan). Any Allied signatory that ratified the treaty would automatically join the League.

Germany was forced to ratify the treaty first, which it did on 10 July 1919. Italy ratified on 7 October 1919, the British Empire and its colonies ratified on 10 October 1919, and France ratified on 12 October 1919. These ratifications were deposited (along with those of ten other countries) on 10 January 1920. All but three of the remaining signatories (the United States, Ecuador, and the Kingdom of Hejaz) had ratified by the time the Assembly first met on 15 November 1920.

The Covenant also invited 13 neutral nations to join the League. To join, an invitee had to agree (&quot;accede without reservation&quot;) to the Covenant within two months of the League&#x27;s founding. All 13 invitees accepted their invitations within the two-month deadline; four of them accepted their invitations even before the League was founded.

The United States Senate voted in favor of ratification, but this failed to reach the necessary two-thirds majority. Hejaz (later Saudi Arabia) also never ratified the treaty. Ecuador would not ratify the treaty until 1934. As an original Allied signatory, Ecuador was entitled to join the League this way with no deadline or Assembly vote, and the League considered Ecuador to still be a founding member.

Uniquely, China (then the Beiyang government) joined the League by ratifying the Treaty of St. Germain (with Austria) instead of the Treaty of Versailles (with Germany), as both treaties included the Covenant of the League of Nations. It had refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles due to it giving the previously-German-controlled Shandong colony in China to the Empire of Japan.

Additional members could join the League by a two-thirds vote of the Assembly.

==List==
Founding members below are listed in the order matching the Covenant (signatories first, followed by invitees), except for Ecuador. The colonies of the British Empire immediately followed it and did not sign in alphabetical order. Czechoslovakia and El Salvador were alphabetized under &#x27;S&#x27;.
A country was allowed to send a withdrawal notice at any time, but it would take two years to come into effect after the League received it, and meanwhile the country would retain both its obligations and its membership. In practice, a withdrawing country quit the League immediately, and was absent from all sessions and votes for the last two years of its formal membership. The &quot;Date of withdrawal&quot; column shows when the withdrawal notice was sent.

==Expulsion of the Soviet Union==
On 14 December 1939, the Soviet Union was expelled for invading Finland in violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations, by a Council vote of 7–0–4–3 (7 in favor, 0 against, 4 abstaining, 3 absent). The United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, South Africa, and Egypt voted in favor; the Republic of China, Finland, Greece, and Yugoslavia abstained; and Iran, Peru, and the Soviet Union itself were absent. Three of the votes in favor had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt). This was one of the League&#x27;s final acts before it practically ceased to function.

It has been disputed whether the expulsion was legally valid. Article 16 paragraph 4 of the Covenant stated that the Council may expel a member from the League if all members of the Council other than the to-be-expelled member concur. However, it is unclear if abstentions or absences were permitted for expulsion votes (though it is undisputed that they were allowed for non-expulsion unanimous Council decisions). Even if permitted, it is disputed whether the expulsion could be legally valid without a majority (8 out of 14) of the Council in favor.

Regardless, both the expulsion and dispute had little practical effect. The Soviet Union had already declared nine days earlier that it would be absent from the League until further notice; it acknowledged its expulsion and made no move to challenge it on the disputed grounds. No other member was ever expelled from the League to demonstrate any precedent, and the League took no further significant actions due to the Second World War.

==Non-members==
Between November and December 1920, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine applied for membership amid the dissolution of the Russian Empire and the Russian Civil War, but were denied because they did &quot;not appear to have a stable government whose authority extends over the whole of its territory&quot;. (Some extra consideration was given to Armenia due to it being a signatory of the Treaty of Sèvres, which would have given Armenia some territory from the broken-up Ottoman Empire, but the treaty failed to be ratified.) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also applied in 1920 and were denied that year because they &quot;had not achieved a definite international status&quot; at the time (the three would be admitted the next year).

Some of the European microstates, namely Liechtenstein, Monaco, and San Marino, also applied for membership but were denied, explicitly due to their &quot;small size&quot;. Andorra and Vatican City never sought membership.

Iceland was given the opportunity to join the League of Nations in 1920, but opted not to, primarily due to limited administrative resources.

Some relatively-isolated sovereign states in Asia also did not join, including Bhutan, Nepal, and Yemen, at least in part due to having no diplomatic relations with the major powers. Tibet and Mongolia were &quot;de facto&quot; independent, but their independence was not recognized by the major powers.

At the IX Congress of European Nationalities, an organization of the League of Nations, held in Bern, the first three autonomous jurisdictions of Spain (Basque Country, Galicia, and Catalonia), were recognized as nations, but since they were not constitutionally independent, they were represented by the Spanish government.

==World War II and aftermath==
Several member states were occupied or annexed during World War II, during which the League was largely paralyzed and held no sessions or votes. With the exception of the Anschluss, the League did not recognize any of these occupations, and the occupied states remained members of the League on paper. With the exception of Vichy France (later rescinded by Free France), the League also did not recognize any notices of withdrawal sent by puppet regimes, considering them to have been sent under duress. Not all puppet regimes attempted to withdraw.

The membership table above notes occupations that began before the start of World War II in Europe, those that continued after the end of World War II, and those whose puppet states attempted to withdraw. For brevity, the large number of occupations that do not meet these criteria (such as in the case of Luxembourg) are not listed.

The 20th annual session of the Assembly took place in 1939, but the 21st session did not take place until April 1946, after which the League ceased to exist. During this last session, 35 out of 44 League members attended, with Albania, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Iraq, Liberia, Thailand, and the Baltic states not present. (Colombia was present, but only as a non-voting observer as its government had not authorized its representative on whether to vote for or against the dissolution of the League. Allied-occupied Austria was also permitted to send an observer with approval from its occupiers and the rest of the League.)

The League partially did not recognize the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, which were the only member states of the League to remain occupied after the end of World War II. In its last session, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania remained on the list of members of the League. However, two months before the session, the League stated that it would not consider the 1939 documents of any representatives as valid, and required the governments of the League members to furnish new documents naming representatives. When the representatives of the Latvian government-in-exile and Lithuanian government-in-exile attempted to attend the session, a Secretariat staff member denied their 1939 documents as instructed, and explicitly stated that there did not exist any government which could provide them with the necessary credentials. The letter documenting this incident refers to the representatives as the &quot;permanent delegate of Latvia&quot; and &quot;permanent delegate of Lithuania&quot; as titles. (The letter does not mention the presence of the delegate of Estonia.) The staff member offered the representatives, and their family members and assistants, entry into the League&#x27;s diplomatic gallery to spectate the session, but the representatives refused the offer for themselves, while accepting it for their family members and assistants. In addition, the offered entry card, and even the envelope containing the card, explicitly omitted a country name and a title.

The League of Nations was formally dissolved on 18 April 1946; its assets and responsibilities were transferred to the United Nations.

<text>Yousef Alavi (March 19, 1928 – May 21, 2013) was an Iranian born American mathematician who specialized in combinatorics and graph theory. He received his PhD from Michigan State University in 1958. He was a professor of mathematics at Western Michigan University from 1958 until his retirement in 1996; he chaired the department from 1989 to 1992.

Alavi was known for complaining that &quot;this is highly irregular!&quot; He was also a frequent host for Paul Erdős on his visits to Western Michigan. On one of these visits, these two things came together: he made his usual complaint at a time when Erdős and Ronald Graham were present. This sparked a discussion on what it might mean for a graph to be highly irregular, kicking off a line of joint research on highly irregular graphs through which Alavi obtained Erdős number one.

In 1987 he received the first Distinguished Service Award of the Michigan Section of the Mathematical Association of America due to his 30 years of service to the MAA; at that time, the Michigan House and Senate issued a special resolution honoring him.

<doc id="614956" wikidata="Q834127" url="?curid=614956" title="Béla Bollobás">
<text>Béla Bollobás FRS (born 3 August 1943) is a Hungarian-born British mathematician who has worked in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, combinatorics, graph theory, and percolation. He was strongly influenced by Paul Erdős from the age of 14.

==Early life and education==
As a student, he took part in the first three International Mathematical Olympiads, winning two gold medals. Paul Erdős invited Bollobás to lunch after hearing about his victories, and they kept in touch afterward. Bollobás&#x27; first publication was a joint publication with Erdős on extremal problems in graph theory, written when he was in high school in 1962.

With Erdős&#x27;s recommendation to Harold Davenport and a long struggle for permission from the Hungarian authorities, Bollobás was able to spend an undergraduate year in Cambridge, England. However, the authorities denied his request to return to Cambridge for doctoral study. A similar scholarship offer from Paris was also quashed. He wrote his first doctorate in discrete geometry under the supervision of László Fejes Tóth and Paul Erdős in Budapest University, 1967, after which he spent a year in Moscow with Israïl Moiseevich Gelfand. After spending a year at Christ Church, Oxford, where Michael Atiyah held the Savilian Chair of Geometry, he vowed never to return to Hungary due to his disillusion with the 1956 Soviet intervention. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1972 he received a second PhD in functional analysis, studying Banach algebras under the supervision of Frank Adams. Bollobás recalled, &quot;By then, I said to myself, &#x27;If I ever manage to leave Hungary, I won&#x27;t return.&#x27;&quot; In 1970, he was awarded a fellowship to the college.

His main area of research is combinatorics, particularly graph theory. His chief interests are in extremal graph theory and random graph theory. In 1996 he resigned his university post, but remained a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Bollobás has been a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, since 1970; in 1996 he was appointed to the Jabie Hardin Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis, and in 2005 he was awarded a senior research fellowship at Trinity College.

Bollobás has proved results on extremal graph theory, functional analysis, the theory of random graphs, graph polynomials and percolation. For example, with Paul Erdős he proved results about the structure of dense graphs; he was the first to prove detailed results about the phase transition in the evolution of random graphs; he proved that the chromatic number of the random graph on &quot;n&quot; vertices is asymptotically &quot;n&quot;/2 log &quot;n&quot;; with Imre Leader he proved basic discrete isoperimetric inequalities; with Richard Arratia and Gregory Sorkin he constructed the interlace polynomial; with Oliver Riordan he introduced the ribbon polynomial (now called the Bollobás–Riordan polynomial); with Andrew Thomason, József Balogh, Miklós Simonovits, Robert Morris and Noga Alon he studied monotone and hereditary graph properties; with Paul Smith and Andrew Uzzell he introduced and classified random cellular automata with general homogeneous monotone update rules; with József Balogh, Hugo Duminil-Copin and Robert Morris he studied bootstrap percolation; with Oliver Riordan he proved that the critical probability in random Voronoi percolation in the plane is 1/2; and with Svante Janson and Oliver Riordan he introduced a very general model of heterogeneous sparse random graphs.

In addition to over 350 research papers on mathematics, Bollobás has written several books, including the research monographs &quot;Extremal Graph Theory&quot; in 1978, &quot;Random Graphs&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Percolation&quot; (with Oliver Riordan) in 2006, the introductory books &quot;Modern Graph Theory&quot; for undergraduate courses in 1979, &quot;Combinatorics&quot; and &quot;Linear Analysis&quot; in 1990, and the collection of problems &quot;The Art of Mathematics – Coffee Time in Memphis&quot; in 2006, with drawings by Gabriella Bollobás. He has also edited a number of books, including &quot;Littlewood&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;.

Bollobás&#x27;s research students have included Keith Ball at Warwick, Graham Brightwell at LSE, Timothy Gowers (who was awarded a Fields Medal in 1998 and is Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics), Imre Leader at the University of Cambridge, Jonathan Partington at Leeds, and Charles Read at Leeds, who died in 2015.

Bollobás is an External Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; in 2007 he was awarded the Senior Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society. In 2011 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his major contributions to many
different areas of mathematics within the broad field of combinatorics, including random graphs, percolation, extremal graphs, set systems and isoperimetric inequalities. The citation also recognises the profound influence of his
textbooks in many of these areas, and his key role in establishing Britain as one of the leading countries in probabilistic and extremal combinatorics. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

==Awards and honours==
Bollobás was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011. His nomination reads 

In 1998 he was an invited speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. He was elected Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences in 2013, a Member of the Academy of Europea in 2017 and a member of Academia Brasileira Ciencias (ABC) in 2023. He received an honorary doctorate from Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań in 2013. In 2016 he received the Bocskai Prize and the Széchenyi Prize in 2017.

==Personal life==
His father was a physician. His wife, Gabriella Bollobás, born in Budapest, was an actress and a musician in Hungary before moving to England to become a sculptor. She made busts of mathematicians and scientists, including Paul Erdős, Bill Tutte, George Batchelor, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, and Stephen Hawking, as well as a cast bronze of David Hilbert. He has one son, Mark.

Bollobás is also a sportsman, having represented the University of Oxford at modern pentathlon and the University of Cambridge at fencing.

<text>Don Leslie Lind (May 18, 1930 – August 30, 2022) was an American scientist, naval officer, aviator, and NASA astronaut. He graduated from the University of Utah with an undergraduate degree in physics in 1953. Following his military service obligation, he earned a PhD in high-energy nuclear physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964.

Lind was a Naval Aviator and attained the rank of commander in the United States Naval Reserve. After completing his doctorate, Lind worked at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Research Center from 1964 to 1966. Selected with Astronaut Group 5 in 1966, he helped to develop the Apollo 11 EVA activities, and served as CAPCOM for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. Lind was then assigned as backup pilot for Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 and would have flown on Skylab Rescue.

Lind was the payload commander on his only flight, STS-51-B, launched April 29, 1985. He designed an experiment to capture the Earth&#x27;s aurora. The payload experiments consisted primarily of microgravity research and atmospheric measurement. The Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; completed 110 orbits before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Lind was born May 18, 1930, and raised in Midvale, Utah, with his two sisters, Charlene and Kathleen. He attended Midvale Elementary School and graduated from Jordan High School in 1948. He was an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America, its highest rank. He received a Bachelor of Science degree with high honors in physics from the University of Utah in 1953.

As a Naval Aviator, Lind volunteered to take high-altitude photo emulsions of cosmic rays for the University of California, Berkeley during flights. This helped him enroll at Berkeley, where Lind researched pion-nucleon scattering in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and earned a PhD in high-energy nuclear physics in 1964. During a leave of absence from NASA, he conducted postdoctoral research at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks from 1975 to 1976.

=== Navy service ===
Upon completing his undergraduate education, Lind enrolled at the United States Navy Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island. After jokingly requesting flight training, Lind was unable to change his assignment and found that he enjoyed flying. He received his Wings of Gold in 1955 at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and served four years on active duty with the Navy at San Diego and aboard the carrier USS &quot;Hancock&quot;. Lind logged more than 4,500 hours of flight time during his naval and NASA careers, 4,000 of which were in jet aircraft. He continued to serve in the United States Naval Reserve after completing his service obligation, attaining his terminal rank of commander in 1969.

=== NASA career ===

==== Pre-astronaut and selection ====
From 1964 to 1966, Lind worked at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a space physicist. He was involved in experiments to determine the nature and properties of low-energy particles within the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere and interplanetary space. Lind applied for NASA&#x27;s third group of astronauts but did not have enough flight hours, and was too old for the fourth group by 74 days, despite arguing that he would not have to learn to fly. After the age restriction changed, he was among the fifth group, the &quot;Original Nineteen&quot;, selected in April 1966.

Lind was selected as a pilot with other &quot;Original Nineteen&quot; astronauts in contrast to the fourth and sixth astronaut groups, which consisted of medical doctors and Ph.D. scientists who were not qualified pilots. However, he and Group 5 colleague Bruce McCandless II (the salutatorian of his United States Naval Academy class and the recent recipient of a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University) were nonetheless treated as scientist-astronauts by NASA due to their academic training and lack of test pilot experience that Deke Slayton, Al Shepard and other NASA managers emphasized; among other factors, this would delay their progression in the flight rotation.

==== Apollo ====
Along with geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt, Lind helped to develop and demonstrate the flight plan for the Apollo 11 EVA (including the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages that would continue to relay data following the missions) and other tools used on the lunar surface. He also served as a capsule communicator on the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. Schmitt, Lind and Owen Garriott were the only scientist-astronauts to receive advanced helicopter training, a key prerequisite for piloting the Apollo Lunar Module. Due to standard crew rotations, it is believed that Lind would have followed Schmitt as the second scientist-astronaut Lunar Module Pilot on one of the canceled Apollo missions or projected long-range Apollo Applications Program lunar survey missions.

==== Skylab ====
Amid the gradual cancellation of the later Apollo missions and the devolution of the AAP into the Skylab program, Lind was formally reassigned to the latter effort in August 1969; according to Slayton, who noted Lind&#x27;s disappointment, &quot;with the cancellation of [Apollo] 20, I could see I just wasn&#x27;t going to have a flight for him&quot;. Together, Lind and Group 6 scientist-astronaut William B. Lenoir comprised the Earth Resources Group of the Skylab Branch Office.
Lind served as backup pilot alongside backup commander Vance D. Brand and backup science pilot Lenoir for Skylab 3 and Skylab 4, the second and third crewed Skylab missions; was on standby for a rescue mission planned when malfunctions developed in Skylab 3&#x27;s Apollo Command/Service Module (ultimately thwarted due to Brand and Lind&#x27;s resourcefulness in devising a solution in the simulators) and the proposed 20-day Skylab 5 mission (scrapped in favor of the more economical extension of Skylab 4 from 56 to 84 days); and may have flown as a pilot or science pilot on Skylab B.

Astronauts knew little of why or how they were assigned to missions. By the Skylab era, Lind was informally perceived as a &quot;scientist-pilot&quot; because of his doctorate. According to David Shayler, Lind &quot;could never understand why he was not on the [Skylab 4] crew as science pilot&quot; due to his work on the mission&#x27;s Earth resources package; this could be attributed in part to seniority and specialization, as all of the prime crew science pilots were drawn from Group 4. Additionally, Skylab 4 Science Pilot Edward Gibson (like Lind, an atmospheric physicist) had taken on a research program in solar physics and worked on the Apollo Telescope Mount while Lind was still on track to be assigned to a lunar mission. Although he cross-trained with Lenoir and briefly proposed swapping positions with his crewmate, Lind elected to retain his original assignment due to the greater likelihood of the rescue mission (which could only accommodate the commander and pilot) amid the space program&#x27;s dwindling flight opportunities.

According to Michael Cassutt, in 1970, Lind &quot;openly complained&quot; to George Abbey (then technical assistant to Johnson Space Center director Robert R. Gilruth) about the perceived administrative machinations of Slayton and Shepard and Harrison Schmitt&#x27;s assignment to Apollo 17. However, Abbey—a close friend of Schmitt who would eventually oversee Astronaut Corps assignments as director of flight operations from 1976 to 1988—took umbrage at Lind&#x27;s cooperation with a 1969 report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that exposed rampant dissatisfaction among the scientist-astronauts. He also alleged that Lind complained about &quot;any and all subjects&quot; related to the space program, associating him with a coterie of scientist-astronauts (including Story Musgrave) who perceived Abbey as a &quot;faceless &#x27;horse-holder&#x27; who had worked his way into a powerful job.&quot; Although Abbey could not forestall Lind&#x27;s eventual flight, their acrimonious relationship played a key role in hindering the astronaut&#x27;s progression in the flight rotation.

When the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum received the unused Skylab B he &quot;cried ceremonially in front of it&quot;, Lind later said; &quot;I was ... in the right place at the wrong time&quot;. He was reassigned to the Science and Applications Directorate in 1974, formally codifying his status as a scientist-astronaut. In a 1976 memo, Chris Kraft implicitly characterized Lind as one of NASA&#x27;s nine active scientist-astronauts in the context of the payload specialist program.

==== Shuttle era ====

For the Space Shuttle program, Lind was reassigned as a mission specialist along with McCandless (who, unlike Lind, continued to train as a potential Space Shuttle orbiter pilot until 1983) and the remaining Apollo-era scientist-astronauts. During this period, he was a member of the Astronaut Office&#x27;s Operations Missions development group, responsible for developing payloads for the early Space Shuttle Orbital Flight Test (OFT) missions and the Canadarm.

Lind finally flew as the lead mission specialist and de facto payload commander on STS-51-B (April 29 to May 6, 1985), logging over 168 hours in space. Due to Apollo-era managerial preferences, his contentious relationship with George Abbey, NASA budgetary problems and delays in the Space Shuttle program, Lind waited longer than any other continuously serving American astronaut for a spaceflight: 19 years. STS-51-B&#x27;s average age of 48.6 was the oldest for an American space mission.

STS-51-B, the Spacelab-3 science mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985. Following several delays, this was the first fully operational Spacelab mission. A space program aficionado has speculated that Lind&#x27;s science-dominant assignment was a &quot;reward... for sticking around so long,&quot; in contrast to the majority of early STS missions that were centered around routinized satellite deployments. The seven-man crew investigated crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, atmospheric trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary atmospheric simulation, cosmic rays, laboratory animals and human medical monitoring.

With the help of his Alaska postdoctoral group, Lind developed and conducted an experiment to photograph the Earth&#x27;s aurora. As the experiment used a camera already on the Shuttle, NASA only needed to purchase three rolls of film for $36; Lind described it as &quot;the cheapest experiment that has ever gone into space.&quot; After completing 110 orbits of the Earth, the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985.

Lind retired from NASA on the twentieth anniversary of his selection in 1986. For nine years thereafter, he served as a professor of physics and astronomy at Utah State University, until his retirement in 1995.

== Awards and honors ==
Lind was a member of the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Phi Kappa Phi. Lind was active in the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1974, and the NASA Space Flight Medal following his &quot;Challenger&quot; flight.

== Personal life ==
Lind married Kathleen Maughan of Logan, Utah, with whom he had seven children. STS-51-B was two decades after son David&#x27;s stomach aches from fear of appearing on television like the families of other astronauts, such as neighbors James Irwin and Edgar Mitchell. Kathleen said before the mission that &quot;For our family, I think we&#x27;re better off now without the publicity&quot; as space travel became more common.

Lind served as a member of the lay ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served as a missionary in the Northeastern United States before graduating from college (1950–52), and after STS-51-B spoke in General Conference about his experience. He and his wife Kathleen served as public affairs missionaries in the Europe West Area of the Church, as temple missionaries in the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, and, respectively, as a counselor and an assistant matron in the presidency of the Portland Oregon Temple.

Lind&#x27;s wife Kathleen died on June 12, 2022. Lind died on August 30, 2022, in Logan, Utah, with many of his children and grandchildren at his bedside. His funeral was planned for September 10 in Smithfield.

<text>Ralph Jasper Faudree (August 23, 1939 – January 13, 2015) was a mathematician, a professor of mathematics and the former provost of the University of Memphis.

Faudree was born in Durant, Oklahoma. He did his undergraduate studies at Oklahoma Baptist University, graduating in 1961, and received his Ph.D. in 1964 from Purdue University under the supervision of Eugene Schenkman (1922–1977). Faudree was an instructor at the University of California, Berkeley and an assistant professor at the University of Illinois before joining the Memphis State University faculty as an associate professor in 1971. Memphis State became renamed as the University of Memphis in 1994, and Faudree was appointed as provost in 2001.

Faudree specialized in combinatorics, and specifically in graph theory and Ramsey theory. He published more than 200 mathematical papers on these topics together with such notable mathematicians as Béla Bollobás, Stefan Burr, Paul Erdős, Ron Gould, András Gyárfás, Brendan McKay, Cecil Rousseau, Richard Schelp, Miklós Simonovits, Joel Spencer, and Vera Sós. He was the 2005 recipient of the Euler Medal for his contributions to combinatorics. His Erdős number was 1: he cowrote 50 joint papers with Paul Erdős beginning in 1976 and was among the three mathematicians who most frequently co-authored with Erdős.

<text>Jerry Michael Linenger (born January 16, 1955) is a retired Captain in the United States Navy Medical Corps, and a former NASA astronaut who flew on the Space Shuttle and Space Station Mir.

==Background==
Born January 16, 1955, and raised in East Detroit, Michigan, he is married to the former Kathryn M. Bartmann of Arlington Heights, Illinois; they have four children. Linenger graduated from East Detroit High School 1973. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in bioscience from the United States Naval Academy in 1977, a doctorate in medicine from Wayne State University School of Medicine in 1981, a Master of Science degree in systems management from the University of Southern California in 1988, a Master of Public Health degree in health policy from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1989 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in epidemiology from the University of North Carolina in 1989.

Linenger is a member of the Alumni Associations of the U.S. Naval Academy, University of Southern California, Wayne State University School of Medicine, and University of North Carolina, the Association of Naval Aviation, the U.S. Navy Flight Surgeons Association, the Aerospace Medicine Association, the American Medical Association, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the Society of U.S. Navy Preventive Medicine Officers, and the American College of Sports Medicine. He is board-certified in preventive medicine.

==Awards and honors==
*Navy Commendation Medal with gold star
*NASA Space Flight Medals (2)
*Navy Unit Commendation
*Meritorious Unit Commendation
*Navy Battle Effectiveness Award
*National Defense Service Medal (2)
*Top graduate, Naval Flight Surgeon Training and Naval Safety Officer&#x27;s School

*Distinguished Alumni Award, Wayne State University School of Medicine.
*Gold Medal, Royal Canadian Geographical Society
*There is a McDonald&#x27;s in Eastpointe (formerly East Detroit) that was decorated in outer space/Jerry Linenger memorabilia. There was a statue of Linenger next to the cash register. The statue was tragically removed with a remodel in 2020. The sculpture was made by Alex Walker in 2000.

==Academic experience==
Linenger graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and proceeded directly to medical school. After completing his surgical internship training at Balboa Naval Hospital, San Diego, California, and aerospace medicine training at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute, Pensacola, Florida, he served as a naval flight surgeon at Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines. He was then assigned as medical advisor to the Commander, Naval Air Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet, San Diego. After completing doctorate-level training in epidemiology, Linenger returned to San Diego as a research principal investigator at the Naval Health Research Center. He concurrently served as a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine in the Division of Sports Medicine.

==NASA experience==
Linenger joined astronaut selection Group 14 at the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He flew on STS-64 (September 9–20, 1994) aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. Mission highlights included: first use of lasers for environmental research, deployment and retrieval of a solar science satellite, robotic processing of semiconductors, use of an RMS-attached boom for jet thruster research, first untethered spacewalk in 10 years to test a self-rescue jetpack. In completing his first mission, Linenger logged 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes in space, completed 177 orbits, and traveled over 4.5 million miles.

Following his first mission, in January 1995, he began training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, in preparation for a long-duration stay aboard the Russian Space Station Mir. All training was conducted using the Russian language, and consisted of learning all Mir space station systems (life support/electrical/ communication/attitude control/computer systems), simulator training, Soyuz launch/return vehicle operations, and spacewalk water tank training. He also trained as chief scientist to conduct the entire United States science program, consisting of over one-hundred planned experiments in various disciplines. A sampling includes: medicine (humoral immunity, sleep monitoring, radiation dosimetry), physiology (spatial orientation/performance changes during long duration flight), epidemiology (microbial surface sampling), metallurgy (determination of metal diffusion coefficients), oceanography/geology/limnology/physical science (photographic survey (over 10,000 photos) of the Earth), space science (flame propagation), microgravity science (behavior of fluids, critical angle determination).

Linenger launched aboard U.S. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (STS-81) on January 12, 1997, remained on board the space station with two Russian cosmonauts upon undocking of the Shuttle, and eventually returned upon a different mission of &quot;Atlantis&quot; (STS-84) on May 24, 1997—spending a total of 132 days, 4 hours, 1 minute in space—the longest duration flight of an American male at that time.

During his stay aboard Space Station Mir, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and in a non-American made spacesuit. During the five-hour walk, he and his Russian colleague tested for the first time ever the newly designed Orlan-M Russian-built spacesuit, installed the Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) and Benton dosimeter on the outer surface of the station, and retrieved for analysis on Earth numerous externally mounted material-exposure panels.

The three crewmembers also performed a &quot;flyaround&quot; in the Soyuz spacecraft-undocking from one docking port of the station, manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location-thus making Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (U.S. Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz).

While living aboard the space station, Linenger and his two Russian crewmembers faced numerous difficulties: the most severe fire ever aboard an orbiting spacecraft, failures of onboard systems (oxygen generator, carbon dioxide scrubbing, cooling line loop leaks, communication antenna tracking ability, urine collection and processing facility), a near collision with a resupply cargo ship during a manual docking system test, loss of station electrical power, and loss of attitude control resulting in a slow, uncontrolled &quot;tumble&quot; through space. In spite of these challenges and added demands on their time (in order to carry out the repair work), they still accomplished all mission goals-spacewalk, flyaround, and one-hundred percent of the planned U.S. science experiments.

In completing the nearly five-month mission, Linenger logged approximately 50 million miles (the equivalent of over 110 round trips to the Moon and back), more than 2,000 orbits around the Earth, and traveled at an average speed of 18,000 miles per hour.

Linenger retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy in January 1998, and presently lives with his family in northern Michigan.

<text>András Gyárfás (born 1945) is a Hungarian mathematician who specializes in the study of graph theory. He is famous for two conjectures: 

* Together with Paul Erdős he conjectured what is now called the Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture which states that any graph with minimum degree 3 contains a cycle whose length is a power of two. 
* He and David Sumner independently formulated the Gyárfás–Sumner conjecture according to which, for every tree &quot;T&quot;, the &quot;T&quot;-free graphs are χ-bounded.

Gyárfás began working as a researcher for the Computer and Automation Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1968. He earned a candidate degree in 1980, and a doctorate (Dr. Math. Sci.) in 1992. He won the Géza Grünwald Commemorative Prize for young researchers of the János Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1978. He was co-author with Paul Erdős on 15 papers, and thus has Erdős number one.

<doc id="614971" wikidata="Q726384" url="?curid=614971" title="Blacktip reef shark">
<text>The blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, which can be easily identified by the prominent black tips on its fins (especially on the first dorsal fin and its caudal fin). Among the most abundant sharks inhabiting the tropical coral reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, this species prefers shallow, inshore waters. Its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in the region. The blacktip reef shark is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though it has also been known to enter brackish and freshwater environments. It typically attains a length of . Like other sharks, the females are larger than the males.

The blacktip reef shark has extremely small home ranges and exhibits strong site fidelity, remaining within the same local area for up to several years at a time. It is an active predator of small bony fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and has also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark&#x27;s life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.

Timid and skittish, the blacktip reef shark is difficult to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water are at risk of having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Vulnerable. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.

==Taxonomy==

French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard originally described the blacktip reef shark during the 1817–1820 exploratory voyage of the corvette &quot;Uranie&quot;. In 1824, their account was published as part of &quot;Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l&#x27;Uranie et la Physicienne&quot;, Louis de Freycinet&#x27;s 13-volume report on the voyage. The type specimen was a -long juvenile male caught off the island of Waigeo, west of New Guinea. Quoy and Gaimard chose the name &quot;Carcharias melanopterus&quot;, from the Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;pteron&quot; meaning &quot;fin&quot; or &quot;wing&quot;, in reference to this shark&#x27;s prominent fin markings.

Subsequent authors moved the blacktip reef shark to the genus &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature designated it as the type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the scientific name of this shark was mistakenly given as &quot;C. spallanzani&quot;, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (&quot;C. sorrah&quot;). Other common names for this species include blackfin reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.

==Phylogeny==
Like most other members of its genus, the phylogenetic position of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (&quot;C. cautus&quot;). Leonard Compagno&#x27;s 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other &quot;Carcharhinus&quot; species.

==Distribution and habitat==

The blacktip reef shark is found throughout nearshore waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to the Red Sea, including Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, and from there eastward along the coast of the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China and the Philippines to Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia, and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands, including the Marshall, Gilbert, Society, and Hawaiian Islands and Tuamotu. Contrary to what most sources state, there is a report suggesting that the specimens of this species from Japanese waters might be from Taiwan, however a number of sightings and captures of this species have been reported from the inshore waters of Ishigaki Island of Okinawa Prefecture in southern Japan. A Lessepsian migrant, this shark has colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea by way of the Suez Canal.

Although it has been reported from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (&quot;C. leucas&quot;). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.


==Description==
A robustly built species with a streamlined &quot;typical shark&quot; form, the blacktip reef shark has a short, wide, rounded snout and moderately large, oval eyes. Each nostril has a flap of skin in front that is expanded into a nipple-shaped lobe. Not counting small symphysial (central) teeth, the tooth rows number 11–13 (usually 12) on either side of the upper jaw and 10–12 (usually 11) on either side of the lower jaw. The upper teeth are upright to angled and narrowly triangular in shape, bearing serrations that are more coarse on the bases; the lower teeth are similar, but more finely serrated. The teeth of adult males are more abruptly curved than those of females.

The pectoral fins are large and narrowly falcate (sickle-shaped), tapering to points. The sizable first dorsal fin is high with a curving S-shaped rear margin, and originates over the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short rear margin, and is placed opposite the anal fin. There is no ridge between the dorsal fins. This shark is a pale grayish-brown above and white below, with an obvious white band on the sides extending forward from above the anal fin. All the fins have black tips highlighted by lighter-colored borders, which are especially striking on the first dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe. Most blacktip reef sharks are no more than long, though rarely individuals may reach or possibly . The maximum weight on record with the International Game Fish Association is .

==Biology and ecology==

Along with the grey reef shark (&quot;C. amblyrhinchos&quot;) and the whitetip reef shark (&quot;Triaenodon obesus&quot;), the blacktip reef shark is one of the three most common sharks inhabiting coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. This species predominates in shallow habitats, while the other two are mostly found deeper. Fast-swimming and active, the blacktip reef shark may be encountered alone or in small groups; large &quot;social&quot; aggregations have also been observed. For the most part, juvenile and adult sharks are not segregated by sex, save for the movements of pregnant females to give birth. Individuals exhibit strong fidelity to particular areas, where they may remain for several years.

A tracking study off Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific has found the blacktip reef shark has a home range of around , among the smallest of any shark species. The size and location of the range does not change with time of day. Within this range, 3–17% of the area constitute favored hunting patches that are disproportionately occupied by the resident shark. The sharks spend most of their time swimming back and forth along reef ledges, making occasional short forays onto sandy flats. Their average swimming speed decreases when the tide rises at night, possibly because the influx of cooler water reduces their metabolism, or the accompanying movement of prey fishes makes foraging easier. Blacktip reef sharks at Aldabra tend to be more mobile than those at Palmyra, with recorded individual movements of up to over 7 hours.

Blacktip reef sharks, particularly small individuals, fall prey to larger fishes, including groupers, grey reef sharks, tiger sharks (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;), and members of their own species. At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms &quot;Anthobothrium lesteri&quot;, &quot;Nybelinia queenslandensis&quot;, &quot;Otobothrium alexanderi&quot;, and &quot;Platybothrium jondoeorum&quot;, a myxosporidian in the genus &quot;Unicapsula&quot;, and the monogenean &quot;Dermophthirius melanopteri&quot;. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium &quot;Aeromonas salmonicida&quot; subsp. &quot;salmonicida&quot;.

===Feeding===

As often the most abundant apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark plays a major role in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including &quot;Acrochordus granulatus&quot;, &quot;Hydrelaps darwiniensis&quot;, &quot;Hydrophis&quot; spp. and &quot;Lapemis hardwickii&quot;. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.

Researchers working at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands have found the blacktip reef shark can be readily attracted by splashing or striking metal tools against hard objects underwater, as well as by the scent of both healthy and injured fish. As with most sharks, the blacktip reef shark does not have any cone cells in its retina, limiting its ability to discriminate colors and fine details. Instead, its vision is adapted for sensitivity to movement or contrast under low light conditions, which is further enhanced by the presence of a reflective tapetum lucidum. Experiments have shown that this shark is capable of detecting small objects up to away, but is unable to clearly discern the shape of the object. Electroreception is another means by which this shark can locate prey; its ampullae of Lorenzini have a sensitivity of approximately 4 nV/cm and an effective range of . Similar to the grey reef shark, this species becomes more excited and &quot;confident&quot; in the presence of other individuals of its species, and in extreme situations can be roused into a feeding frenzy. Feeding activity may be greater at night than during the day.

==Life history==

Like the other members of its family, the blacktip reef shark is viviparous, though the details of its life history vary across its range. Its reproductive cycle is annual off northern Australia, with mating taking place from January to February, as well as off Moorea in French Polynesia, where mating occurs from November to March. The cycle is biennial off Aldabra, where intense competition within and between species for food may constrain females to only bearing young every other year. Earlier accounts from the Indian Ocean by Johnson (1978), Madagascar by Fourmanoir (1961), and the Red Sea by Gohar and Mazhar (1964), indicated a biannual cycle in these regions with two breeding seasons per year from June to July and December to January. If accurate, the shorter reproductive cycles of these subpopulations may be a consequence of warmer water.

When receptive to mating, a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them. Once the male finds her, he closes to around and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent. A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins; these mating wounds heal completely after 4–6 weeks. After a period of synchronous swimming, the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised. Once the female is in position, the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for several minutes, after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior. Off Moorea, individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year, often to within a week&#x27;s precision, whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing. Younger females are also more likely to fail to become pregnant after mating.

The gestation period has been reported as 10–11 months long in the Indian Ocean and Pacific islands, and 7–9 months long off northern Australia. Earlier authors, such as Melouk (1957), have estimated a gestation period as long as 16 months, though the validity of this figure has subsequently been challenged. The female has a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Newly ovulated egg cases measure by ; after hatching the embryos are sustained by a yolk sac during the first stage of development. After two months, the embryo measures long and has well-developed external gills. After four months, the yolk sac has begun to be converted into a placental connection that attaches to the uterine wall; at this time, the embryo&#x27;s dark fin markings develop. By five months, the embryo measures and has resorbed its external gills; the placenta is fully formed, though some yolk remains until seven months into gestation.

Parturition occurs from September to November, with females making use of shallow nursery areas interior of the reef. Newborn pups measure long in the Indian Ocean and off northern Australia, while free-swimming pups as small as long have been observed in the Pacific islands. The litter size is 2–5 (typically 4), and is not correlated with female size. Young blacktip reef sharks commonly form large groups in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies, over sand flats or in mangrove swamps close to shore. During high tide, they also move onto flooded coral platforms or seaweed beds. Growth is initially rapid; one documented captive shark grew an average of per year in its first two years of life. The growth rate slows to around per year in juveniles and adults. Males and females mature sexually at lengths of and respectively off northern Australia, and and , respectively, off Aldabra. Males mature at long off Palmyra Atoll.

==Human interactions==

Under most circumstances, the blacktip reef shark has a timid demeanor and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, as a way of discouraging these sharks is to submerge one&#x27;s body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.

The blacktip reef shark is a normal catch of coastal fisheries, such as those operating off Thailand and India, but is not targeted or considered commercially important. The meat (sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked for human consumption), liver oil, and fins are used. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Vulnerable and declining. Though it remains widespread and common overall, substantial local declines due to overfishing have now been documented in many areas. This species has a low reproductive rate, limiting its capacity for recovering from depletion. Blacktip reef sharks are popular subjects of public aquarium exhibits, because of their stereotypically &quot;shark-like&quot; appearance, ability to breed in captivity and modest size, and are also attractions for ecotourism divers.

<text>John Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Lounge (June 28, 1946March 1, 2011) was an American engineer, a United States Navy officer, a Vietnam War veteran, and a NASA astronaut. A veteran of three Space Shuttle flights, Lounge logged over 482 hours in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51-I (1985) and STS-26 (1988) and was the flight engineer on STS-35 (1990).

==Personal==
John Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Lounge was born June 28, 1946, in Denver, Colorado, but considered Burlington, Colorado to be his hometown. He graduated from Burlington High School in 1964, then received a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and a Master of Science degree in astrophysics from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1970. Lounge was an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
He is survived by his three children. The Lounge family is of Irish and Mexican descent.

==Military career==
Lounge entered on active duty with the United States Navy following graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy and spent the next nine years in a variety of assignments. He completed Naval Flight Officer training at Pensacola, Florida, went on to advanced training as a radar intercept officer in the F-4J Phantom II, and subsequently reported to Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142) based at Naval Air Station Miramar, California. While with VF-142, he completed a nine-month Southeast Asia cruise aboard (participating in 99 combat missions in the Vietnam War) and a seven-month Mediterranean cruise aboard . In 1974, he returned to the U.S. Naval Academy as an instructor in the Physics Department. Lounge transferred to the Navy Space Project Office in Washington, D.C., in 1976, for a two-year tour as a staff project office. He resigned his regular Navy commission in 1978 and joined the Naval Air Reserve. While in the Naval Air Reserve, he served in Reserve Fighter Squadron 201. Later, he became a Lieutenant Colonel in the Texas Air National Guard, serving with the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group.

==NASA career==
Lounge was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center beginning in July 1978. During this time, he worked as lead engineer for Space Shuttle-launched satellites, and also served as a member of the Skylab Reentry Flight Control Team. He completed these assignments while with the Payload Operations Division.

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1980, he completed a one-year training and evaluation period, and became an astronaut in August 1981. He served as a member of the launch support team at Kennedy Space Center for the STS-1, STS-2, and STS-3 missions. Following his first flight, he was assigned to the first mission to carry the Centaur (cryogenically fueled) upper stage (STS-61-F). After the mission was canceled, he participated in Space Station design development. From 1989 through 1991, Lounge served as Chief of the Space Station Support Office, representing astronaut interests in Space Station design and operation planning.

===Spaceflights===
STS-51-I Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 27, 1985. During that mission Lounge&#x27;s duties included deployment of the Australian AUSSAT communications satellite and operation of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew deployed two other communications satellites, the Navy&#x27;s SYNCOM IV-4, and American Satellite Company&#x27;s ASC-1, and also performed a successful on-orbit rendezvous and repair of the ailing 15,400 lb (6,990 kg) SYNCOM IV-3 satellite. STS-51-I completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1985. Mission duration was 171 hours, 17 minutes, 42 seconds.

STS-26 &quot;Discovery&quot;, the first flight to be flown after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, launched from the Kennedy Space Center on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crewmen successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket. They also operated eleven mid-deck experiments. &quot;Discovery&quot; completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988. Mission duration was 97 hours, 57 seconds.

STS-35 &quot;Columbia&quot;, launched from the Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1990. Lounge served as flight engineer on this 9-day flight that was dedicated to astronomy. Observations of the Universe were collected by the ASTRO-1 ultraviolet telescope and by the Broad Band X-ray Telescope. &quot;Columbia&quot; completed 142 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 10, 1990. Mission duration was 215 hours, 5 minutes, 8 seconds.

==Post-NASA career==
Lounge resigned from NASA in June 1991 to join SPACEHAB (now Astrotech Corporation). At the time, Lounge explained his resignation from the NASA Astronaut Corps by saying &quot;This is a very tough job to leave, but I feel that three flights is my fair share, and I&#x27;m ready for a new challenge.&quot;

In 2002, Lounge became Director of Space Shuttle and Space Station Program Development for Boeing. Two years later he became Director for Business Development for integrated defense systems and space exploration.

Lounge joined Sure Secure Solutions, an 8(a) company, as Director Business Development in March 2010. He also launched his new engineering venture Cisneros Innovation Strategies the same year.

==Death==
Lounge died on March 1, 2011, of complications from liver cancer.

<doc id="614977" wikidata="Q6484223" url="?curid=614977" title="Land of the Lost (1991 TV series)">
<text>Land of the Lost is a half-hour Saturday-morning children&#x27;s television series that debuted on ABC in the fall of 1991, a remake of the original series of the same name which ran from 1974 to 1976. Re-runs were later picked up by Nickelodeon from 1995 to 1997. Tiger Toys received the license to produce a toyline based on the series, which included regular and &quot;talking&quot; action figures, several dinosaurs and playsets, an electronic &quot;Crystal Sword&quot;, as well as an electronic LCD game and a board game.

== Synopsis ==
Motivated by the success in syndication of the cult 1974 series &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, Sid and Marty Krofft created a new version of it. The new &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; had advanced special effects and a lighter, less survivalist-oriented tone. Frequent writers Len Janson and Chuck Menville had previously crafted numerous scripts for assorted Filmation series, while producer Jerry Golod had earlier collaborated with George A. Romero on &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;.

The series ran for 26 episodes spread over two seasons, with each season consisting of 13 episodes. It featured the Porter family - teenager Kevin, his young sister Annie, and their widowed father Tom - trapped in a parallel universe after their Jeep Cherokee fell through a time portal while exploring the back country. They soon meet another human, a beautiful jungle girl named Christa who came from 1960s San Francisco. Christa became trapped in the Land of the Lost when she was very young and grew up alone (an earlier concept would have featured an adult Holly Marshall as the &quot;mystery girl&quot;, along with Cha-Ka, but, due to casting, the characters were re-visualized as Christa and Stink).

The Porters live in a large &quot;treehouse&quot; (although it is actually built between a series of large logs and not rooted trees) that the family built after they realized their tents provided little safety from dangerous dinosaurs. After their first encounter with the dinosaur Scarface, they devised an alarm system by stringing up a series of empty tin cans surrounding the treehouse perimeter that would shake and make noise if Scarface were to show up again.

Intelligent natives of the Land of the Lost include the chimpanzee-like Pakuni and the lizard-like Sleestaks. Also, many species of dinosaurs fill the jungle. A Paku named Stink and a baby dinosaur named Tasha were befriended by the Porters. Acting as antagonists were a trio of exiled Sleestak criminals named Shung, Keeg and Nim. Shung is their leader and possesses a powerful Crystal Sword. Another major obstacle faced by the Porters was a one-eyed &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; named Scarface, who lived near the area where the family made their home and frequently chased after them in an attempt to eat them.

A sorceress named Keela with genuine magical powers was introduced in the second season and appeared in two episodes. Another character added in the second season was Namaki, a strange fish-like humanoid who befriended Christa when she was just a little girl.

12 episodes of Season 1 were released onto videocassette at two episodes per video. As of 2024, the series has yet to be released on DVD or Blu-ray. However, as of February 2025, it is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

== Characters ==
=== The Porters ===
* Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Porter (portrayed by Timothy Bottoms) is the main character of the series, the widowed father of Kevin and Annie. After his wife, Natasha, died in a car accident, he spent the next few years burying himself in his work as an architect. Before his wife&#x27;s death, Tom would take his family camping most weekends in order to devote more time to them. Continuing the tradition, he arranged to take his children on the camping trip which ultimately led to their arrival in the Land of the Lost. As a result, he feels enormous guilt for trapping his family in this dangerous place and strives to find a way back home to San Francisco at every opportunity. He is a compassionate man with a deep sense of morality and fairplay even when dealing with those who would threaten him or his family. Tom is a devoted and protective parent but is not above giving his kids &quot;space&quot; when he feels it is acceptable to do so. Back home, he often spent his afternoons jogging, hoping one day to win a marathon race. In the episode, &quot;Flight to Freedom&quot;, it is revealed he is approximately 180 pounds (He says to Scarface that he is, &quot;180 pounds of raw meat&quot;).
* Kevin Porter (portrayed by Robert Gavin) is Tom&#x27;s 16-year-old son. He is the most laid-back member of the family. Not only does he accept their situation but he actually grows to like it. Unfortunately, his carefree attitude breeds indifference to the dangers around him and he often finds himself in more peril than he expected. He likes to think of himself as an adult and will often disobey his father if he thinks Tom is being unfair. Of all the Porters, Kevin is the one most reliant on the comforts and conveniences of the modern world. In addition to the usual camping gear, Kevin also smuggled in a portable six-inch TV, a camcorder, a boom-box, and a bag of various junk foods which he keeps hidden from the others. His goal is to one day become a world-famous director, and he carries the camcorder with him at all times to capture the sights and wonders of the Land of the Lost. He expects this footage to propel him to stardom once they return to their own world. He is also a capable, self-taught mechanic, and one of his primary responsibilities is taking care of the family truck to ensure that it is running smoothly when they need it. Kevin often prefers to explore alone and dislikes having to &quot;babysit&quot; his sister. He thinks of her as being a complete &quot;nerd&quot; and often trades insults with her. However, deep down he&#x27;s very much a caring brother and will not hesitate to act if she&#x27;s in danger. Kevin has a crush on Christa and often goes out of his way to impress her.
* Anamarie &quot;Annie&quot; Porter (portrayed by Jennifer Drugan) is Tom&#x27;s 11-year-old daughter. She is very bright and intuitive for her age and resents her family (especially Kevin whom she considers a &quot;dork&quot;) for treating her like a baby. She has had to grow up rather quickly in a hostile environment and has shown that she is more than capable of taking care of herself on many occasions. Annie is a vegetarian, and one of her responsibilities is maintaining her garden at the base of the treehouse. The sorceress Keela takes her on as an apprentice and entrusts her with her spellbook when she has to leave for extended periods. Annie is extremely protective of the dinosaur Tasha and treats her not as a pet but as a member of the family. She is also a bit of an artist, as shown in the episode, &quot;The Thief&quot;, when she draws a picture of Christa to give her as a present for the birthday party they throw her. In, &quot;Annie in Charge&quot;, her full name is revealed to be, &quot;Anamarie&quot;.

=== Visitors to the Land ===
* Christa (portrayed by Shannon Day as an adult, Farrah Emami as a child) is a lovely jungle girl. Like the Porters, she is from on Earth where she was born in Chicago. Her family was trapped in the Land of the Lost through circumstances similar to the Porters. At one point, Christa&#x27;s family built a raft to try to sail to the other side of the ocean, hoping to find signs of civilization. In a subsequent storm, Christa was washed overboard but found refuge on a floating tree trunk where after several days of drifting she found her way to a far away beach. Separated from her parents, Christa grew up practically alone and by the time the Porters met her, had repressed almost everything about her previous life. She is fiercely independent and feels safe and at home in the jungle. However, she&#x27;s not oblivious to its many dangers and uses her knowledge of its topography, inhabitants, and various medicinal plants to aid the Porters whenever she can. Christa is fluent in Pakuni often greeting her human friends with &quot;Acuba Ne&quot; to express both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;. She is like an older sister to Annie and the object of Kevin&#x27;s infatuation. Flashbacks of Christa as a child were seen in &quot;Life&#x27;s a Beach&quot;. She has curly brown hair and wears a fur bikini along with fur boots. In addition, Christa also has a yell similar to Tarzan&#x27;s that can calm certain animals which she presumably learned from Stink.
* Sir Balen (portrayed by Bobby Jacoby) a squire who pretended to be a knight from King Arthur&#x27;s Court. After &quot;borrowing&quot; his master&#x27;s armor and sword while he&#x27;s asleep, Marty Balen sets out into the moors and is enshrouded in a &quot;blue bubbling fog&quot; and winds up in the Land of the Lost just in time to save Christa from the Sleestaks. After Shung hears of this, he sends the Sleestaks after &quot;Ironface&quot;&#x27;s &quot;magic blade&quot; (his sword). Balen&#x27;s desire to protect &quot;M&#x27;lady Christa&quot; causes friction with a jealous Kevin as he sets out to escort her home not aware that she can take care of herself. Kevin is guilted into going after him when they again encounter Scarface (&quot;The king of all dragons&quot;). After eluding him, the ground shakes and another doorway appears. Balen offers Kevin his morning star in recognition of his bravery and disappears through the gate.
* Keela (portrayed by Adilah Barnes) is a sorceress from another time who was banished to the Land for not using her magic to aid Magas. She arrived through a green dimensional gate located in a desert on the other side of the Land of the Lost. Keela is gifted in the ways of magic and sorcery but is not powerful enough to send the Porters (or herself) home. The Porters helped her defeat her enemy Magas whom Keela had turned into a one-eyed dinosaur-like beast. Keela trusts the Porters entirely, even accepting Annie as an informal apprentice and asking her to guard her spellbook while away. She is a very compassionate person, but admits that even she has times when she abuses her powers (i.e. turning her older brothers into toads) although she may have been joking.
* Magas (portrayed by Ed Gale) is a short, cruel sorcerer and the brother of the late queen whom Keela served. She recognized him as a heartless person and turned him into a Cyclopean dinosaur-like beast, similar to a giant from &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; and the Cyclops from &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, thus sealing his magical powers. Over time, he slowly regained his power and hunted Keela down to the Porters&#x27; treehouse. He was defeated by Keela with Tasha&#x27;s help, but not before Keela restored him to his true form.
* Siren (portrayed by Marta DuBois) was once a beautiful woman, but her beauty became more important than her family. She was sentenced to the Land with no hope of ever seeing the ones she loved in the afterlife and she used her music to bring the Porters to her. The Siren disguised herself as Tom&#x27;s wife Natasha. After talking to Tom about her past, she was finally able to ascend to the heavens.
* Simon Cardenas (portrayed by Danny Gonzalez) s a teenage time-traveler from San Francisco Island in the year 2062. After &quot;borrowing&quot; his father&#x27;s time-belt, he collides with a Myzarian Cyborg while traveling through the time/space corridor, and his damaged belt drops him off in the Land following a dimensional shift. He wears an &quot;inter-trans&quot; suit that apparently works in conjunction with the belt, possibly protecting the wearer from the forces involved in such travel. He frequently speaks using a form of &quot;futuristic slang&quot; that involves a shortening of modern adjectives (for example, &quot;pendous&quot; for &quot;stupendous&quot; or &quot;morb&quot; for &quot;morbid&quot;). He returns home once the belt&#x27;s auto-recall device is activated.
* Cy, also known as the Myzarian Cyborg, it is a gigantic rancor-like cyborg from the planet Myzar-3 who became trapped in the Land of the Lost after colliding with another time traveler in the dimensional corridor, damaging his time device. He is exceptionally intelligent, and his strength alone makes him more than an even match for the dinosaur Scarface. Some of his cybernetic enhancements include the ability to see in the infrared spectrum in one eye as well as heightened senses. He lives in a cave in the mountains that he has made into a base of operations and attacks anyone who comes near. The entrance to his lair is booby-trapped with auto-defense mechanisms which include a form of nerve gas that causes temporary memory loss in humans and renders them unconscious. He wears a device on his wrist which can perform a similar function. Because he comes from a world rich in hydrogen and oxygen, he becomes winded easily in the Land due to the thinner air. In addition, this particular model was recalled due to being particularly susceptible to ultraviolet light.

=== Native inhabitants ===
Like its 1970s counterpart, the inhabitants of the Land of the Lost are mostly dinosaurs. An iguana can be seen occasionally. A creature, called an &quot;osongi&quot;, which resembles an iguana, once bit Tom. A spitting viper called the &quot;shika&quot; is seen in the Valley of Death, and it blinds Kevin temporarily. Termites have also been found.

==== Tasha ====
One of the main dinosaurs in the show is Tasha (performed by Ed Gale, voiced by Danny Mann), an orphaned baby &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;. After the death of her mother at the claws of Scarface, Tasha&#x27;s egg was rescued by Annie. Upon hatching, Kevin was the first person she saw and she immediately imprinted on him. However, possibly because he ignores her, Tasha treats Annie as her mother instead living with the Porters as a pet. What will happen to her if the Porters ever find a way home, is a frequent subject of discussion. Annie names her after her mother. Tasha appears to be quite intelligent for a dinosaur exhibiting almost human behavior at times. Through pantomime, body language, and an extensive range of vocal emotions she is surprisingly capable of communicating with humans. She seems to understand complex commands and inquiries and is even able to grasp and manipulate items in her claws (like throwing a ball). For a short time, Tasha was given the ability to speak by Keela. Tasha has a voracious appetite for a herbivore and will try to eat almost anything within reach. However, she prefers melons.

==== Scarface ====
A &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, whom the Porters named Scarface (this series&#x27; reboot of 1970s&#x27; Grumpy) lives in the area. He has a scar through his right eye, hence his name, which is a lasting testament to his aggressive nature. Scarface is blind in his right eye because of the scar, leaving him able to see only through his left eye (an advantage to his prey). Scarface is one of the Porters&#x27; worst threats, as he could take down their treehouse and has tried to before.

Because of his violent nature, Scarface is an enemy to everybody in the series, including the Sleestaks. When Cy arrived, it was thought that he killed Scarface in their fight, but it was eventually revealed that Scarface was simply unconscious and used mud to heal himself. Also, upon being hit by a &quot;light gun&quot; found by Kevin and Stink in old Sleestak ruins, Scarface quickly recovered.

==== Pakuni ====
Pakuni are a tribe of hairy, humanoid primates native to the Land. In this series, their appearance is slightly different from the original 1974 series and 2009 movie. One Pakuni named Stink (portrayed by Bobby Porter) is a close friend to Christa and the Porter family.

==== Sleestaks ====
A race of intelligent, reptilian humanoids, the Sleestaks were highly advanced until their own pollution drove them to live in caves to avoid the dinosaurs (&quot;thunder lizards&quot; in their tongue). Unlike the original series, the Sleestaks don&#x27;t have insectoid traits. The Sleestaks seen in the show are a group of criminals who were exiled to the surface world, their version of the death penalty. Omnivores, they will consume anything and have threatened to eat the Porters and their companions on several occasions. The trio took up refuge in an old, abandoned temple and have only managed to survive because of Shung&#x27;s power crystal.
* Shung (portrayed by Tom Allard): Self-proclaimed leader of the Sleestak criminal band. He is arrogant, self-absorbed, and contemptuous of anyone but himself. He calls himself the ruler of the Land of the Lost, and he claims all that lives there (including the Porters and their truck) belong to him. While he possesses great strength and cunning, he is often depicted as lazy, preferring to send his minions, Nim and Keeg, out into the jungle to bring him food and to perform any other task that he feels is beneath him. He enforces his will with a powerful crystal that can perform amazing feats of both telekinetic and telepathic prowess and even gives him the ability to control minds. However, there is a price for this power; it gradually corrupts the mind of its user, as Annie discovers in &quot;The Crystal&quot;. As a result, Shung is now addicted to the crystal&#x27;s unique energy, and, if separated from it, will quickly weaken. His crystal is destroyed by Christa after he forced the Porters to fight each other. After looking through Keela&#x27;s spellbook, Shung now knows a few spells. Shung often refers to those he considers inferior (meaning everyone) by nicknames such as calling his underlings &quot;Wartsnippers&quot;, Christa &quot;Long Hair&quot;, and Kevin &quot;Quickmouth&quot;.

* Nim and Keeg (portrayed by R.C. Tass and Brian Williams respectively in 1991, Ross Kramer and Bret Davidson respectively in 1992): Shung&#x27;s underlings. Nim appears to be the smarter one and was able to recite and use a spell Annie cast after hearing it only once. Keeg appears to be the dumb one as he did not know what a chariot was. However, he is a strong fighter (his peripheral vision is his chief weakness) and an excellent tracker. He is the most submissive of the pair. Despite their differences, they both try to please Shung with whatever they catch for him. However, their efforts almost always go unnoticed or unappreciated. &quot;Keeg&quot; is &quot;geek&quot; spelled backwards.

==== Others ====
* Namaki (portrayed by Tom Allard) is a strange, piscine-like humanoid who lives in a hut-like shelter on a beach miles from the Porter treehouse. Years ago, he befriended Christa&#x27;s family and helped them build a raft to cross the ocean. They were reunited many years later when Christa (whom he refers to as &quot;Christas&quot;) brought the Porters to that very same beach to relax. Despite his aquatic physiology, Namaki has never been to the other side of the ocean, afraid to attempt the crossing because of the frequent storms and the dangerous marine predators. Namaki is unable to hear music possibly due to his aquatic physiology. It is revealed that Namaki has a dislike for dinosaurs (&quot;thunder lizards&quot;), because of a scar he received on his right shoulder years before. But after the incident with the Siren, Namaki comes to like Tasha.

=== Unseen characters ===
* Natasha Porter (portrayed by Marta DuBois): Annie and Kevin&#x27;s deceased mother. It was revealed in &quot;Life&#x27;s a Beach&quot; that she died in a car accident two years before the events of the episode. Her name was revealed to be Natasha in the first episode, as Annie decided to name Tasha after her mother. In the episode &quot;Siren&#x27;s Song&quot;, a Siren takes on her form to fool Tom, but Natasha is never physically seen in any episode. Her voice is heard on the telephone in &quot;Dream Maker&quot; when the Porters think they have found their way back home, but such as the house itself, this was merely an illusion to confuse the family.
* Stink&#x27;s Mother and Father: Stink reveals that many Pakuni were used as slave labor by the Sleestaks. Among those were his parents, both of whom died from overwork.

== Features ==
As with its 1970s counterpart, the Land of the Lost (never actually named within the series) exists in an entirely different dimension. It is a world similar to prehistoric Earth but it has three moons. The area in which the Porters live is a tropical jungle, although mention has also been made of a vast desert far away.

=== Crystals ===
Unique to this world is a peculiar type of quartz-like crystal that can be found in various caves throughout the Land. The Sleestaks often use Pakuni slave labor to mine these special crystals which can function as an energy source. In &quot;Kevin vs. the Volcano&quot;, Kevin falls down a shaft covered in Sleestak markings (often marked by pictographs of lizards) and finds a huge shard nearly twice his size. Exposure to the sun reactivates this crystal and it causes it to pulsate, exerting a force which draws Kevin towards it when he tries to climb out of the shaft. Tom posits that the Sleestaks probably used these giant crystals to power their underground cities. It also might have been placed as a controlling device (not unlike the pylons from the 1970s series) for a nearby volcano as its destruction somehow reverses the volcano&#x27;s eruption. In &quot;Power Play&quot;, the Porters use the smaller pieces to act as surrogate &quot;batteries&quot; to run their flashlights and portable devices, but larger crystals (like Shung&#x27;s) are much more powerful.

Even the smaller shards can be powerful when grouped together in a certain fashion. The Porters discover such a grouping hidden inside a stone carving in a cave in &quot;Dreammaker&quot;. They find a number of crystals, varying in length, set into a device very similar to the matrix tables of the 1974 series. This particular table is able to create very realistic illusions (but with physical substance) drawn from one&#x27;s mind, designed to lure them in to a carefully constructed - but very real - trap. Tom believes that the Sleestaks probably built it to be a psychic weapon.

=== Dimensional Gates ===
These often blue (but sometimes green) swirling mists are portals to other worlds and times. They appear to be triggered by earthquakes and are accompanied by sudden winds just before they open and only for a few moments. In this version of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; they seem to materialize at random but can be tracked through their electromagnetic interference using the Porter&#x27;s portable TV. Tom Porter believes these gates will get them home even though he cannot be sure where or when it will take them.

<doc id="614983" wikidata="Q3028610" url="?curid=614983" title="George Low">
<text>George Michael Low (born Georg Michael Löw, June 10, 1926 – July 17, 1984) was an administrator at NASA and the 14th president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Low was one of the senior NASA officials who made decisions as manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office in the Apollo program of crewed missions to the Moon.

==Early life and education==
Low was born near Vienna, Austria, to Artur and Gertrude Löw (née Burger), who had a prosperous manufacturing business, and was educated in private schools in Switzerland and England. His father died in 1934. When Nazi Germany occupied Austria in 1938, Low&#x27;s family—being Jewish—emigrated to the United States. In 1943, Low graduated from Forest Hills High School in Forest Hills, New York, and entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), where he joined the Delta Phi fraternity. His college education was interrupted by the Second World War and from 1944 to 1946, he served in the United States Army. During his military service, he became a naturalized American citizen and legally changed his name to George Michael Low.

After military service, Low returned to RPI and received his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1948. He then worked at Convair in Fort Worth, Texas, as a mathematician in an aerodynamics group. Low returned to RPI late in 1948 and received his Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in 1950.

==NACA and NASA career==
===At Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory===
After completing his M.S. degree, Low joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) as an engineer at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, (later the Lewis Research Center and now the Glenn Research Center). He worked as the head of the Fluid Mechanics Section (1954–1956) and chief of the Special Projects Branch (1956–1958). Low specialized in experimental and theoretical research in the fields of heat transfer, boundary layer flows, and internal aerodynamics. In addition, he worked on such space technology problems as orbit calculations, reentry paths, and space rendezvous techniques.

=== NASA Goett Committee ===
During the summer and autumn of 1958, preceding the formation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Low worked on a planning team to organize the new aerospace agency. Soon after NASA&#x27;s formal organization in October 1958, Low transferred to the agency&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he served as Chief of Manned Space Flight. In this capacity, he was closely involved in the planning of Projects Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. Low played a critical role in advocating for a lunar landing as NASA&#x27;s long-term goal. He testified before Congress, spoke to the media, and presented at industry conferences on behalf of NASA. Low also formed the Low Committee in 1960, which produced a lunar landing feasibility study that played a role in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s decision to set a goal of landing humans on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

=== Houston and the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office ===

In February 1964, Low transferred to NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, (now the Johnson Space Center) and served as Deputy Center Director. In April 1967, following the Apollo 1 fire, he was named manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO), where he was responsible for directing the changes to the Apollo spacecraft necessary to make it flightworthy. In this role he led the use of FMEA, or failure mode and effects analysis, to rigorously define the possible risks in human space flight. Low also created and chaired the Configuration Control Board, which had as its purpose to monitor technical changes that could inadvertently affect some other part of the complex Apollo system, thereby helping assure future mission safety. Flight Director Glynn Lunney praised Low&#x27;s leadership, and his contributions helped return the Apollo project schedule to the promised date for the Moon landing.

=== NASA deputy administrator ===
George Low became NASA deputy administrator in December 1969, serving with Administrators Thomas O. Paine and James C. Fletcher. He served as acting administrator after Paine&#x27;s resignation. In these roles, Low played a significant part in the development of the Space Shuttle program, the Skylab program, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

Rocket engineer Wernher von Braun blamed Low for what he felt was shabby treatment in the early 1970s while he was at NASA Headquarters. According to Bob Ward&#x27;s 2005 biography, von Braun believed Low was jealous of his fame and that Low helped force von Braun&#x27;s unhappy departure from the space agency. However, another biography by space historian Michael J. Neufeld disputed Low&#x27;s involvement in von Braun&#x27;s resignation. Low&#x27;s biography by Richard Jurek also disputes this account, indicating Low&#x27;s efforts to try to retain and engage von Braun in strategic planning in the early 1970s and being pleased with von Braun&#x27;s work. 

==President of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute==
Retiring from NASA in 1976, Low became president of RPI. He held that position until his death in 1984. He initiated the Rensselaer Technology Park. The New York State Center for Industrial Innovation was renamed the George M. Low Center for Industrial Innovation by RPI shortly after his death.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Low married Mary Ruth McNamara of Troy, New York. Between 1952 and 1963, they had five children: Mark S., Diane E., George David, John M., and Nancy A. His son David became an astronaut for NASA in 1985, flew three times on the Space Shuttle, and died in 2008.

On April 8, 1985, the White House announced that Low had been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to the fields of education and science.

==In popular culture==
In the 1996 TV movie, &quot;Apollo 11&quot; Low was played by Dennis Lipscomb. In the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; he was played by Holmes Osborne.

<text>Richard Rado FRS (28 April 1906 – 23 December 1989) was a German-born British mathematician whose research concerned combinatorics and graph theory. He was Jewish and left Germany to escape Nazi persecution. He earned two PhDs: in 1933 from the University of Berlin, and in 1935 from the University of Cambridge. He was interviewed in Berlin by Lord Cherwell for a scholarship given by the chemist Sir Robert Mond which provided financial support to study at Cambridge. After he was awarded the scholarship, Rado and his wife left for the UK in 1933. He was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Reading in 1954 and remained there until he retired in 1971.

==Contributions==
Rado made contributions in combinatorics and graph theory including 18 papers with Paul Erdős.

In graph theory, the Rado graph, a countably infinite graph containing all countably infinite graphs as induced subgraphs, is named after Rado. He rediscovered it in 1964 after previous works on the same graph by Wilhelm Ackermann, Erdős, and Alfréd Rényi.

In combinatorial set theory, the Erdős–Rado theorem extends Ramsey&#x27;s theorem to infinite sets. It was published by Erdős and Rado in 1956. Rado&#x27;s theorem is another Ramsey-theoretic result concerning systems of linear equations, proved by Rado in his thesis. The Milner–Rado paradox, also in set theory, states the existence of a partition of an ordinal into subsets of small order-type; it was published by Rado and E. C. Milner in 1965.

The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem can be described either in terms of set systems or hypergraphs. It gives an upper bound on the number of sets in a family of finite sets, all the same size, that all intersect each other. Rado published it with Erdős and Chao Ko in 1961, but according to Erdős it was originally formulated in 1938.

In matroid theory, Rado proved a fundamental result of transversal theory by generalizing the Marriage Theorem for matchings between sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot; to the case where &quot;X&quot; has a matroid structure and matchings must match to an independent set in the matroid on &quot;X&quot;.

The Klarner–Rado Sequence is named after Rado and David A. Klarner.

==Awards and honours==
In 1972, Rado was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize.

<text>George David Low (February 19, 1956 – March 15, 2008) was an American aerospace executive and a NASA astronaut. With undergraduate degrees in physics and mechanical engineering and a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautics and astronautics, he worked in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology in the early 80&#x27;s, before being picked as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1984. In addition to holding some technical assignments, he logged more than 700 hours in space (including stints on the &quot;Columbia&quot;, the &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and the &quot;Endeavour&quot; Space Shuttles), before he left NASA in 1996 to pursue a career in the private sector. He was the son of George M. Low, the manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, and later, the 14th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

== Personal life ==
Low was born February 19, 1956, in Cleveland, Ohio, to George and Mary Ruth Low (nee McNamera), and was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He was married to the former JoAnn Andochick of Weirton, West Virginia. They had three children. He enjoyed tennis, lacrosse, scuba diving, running, and spending time with his family. In 1968 it was his father who proposed that Apollo 8 fly to the Moon.
Low died of colon cancer on March 15, 2008, at Reston Hospital Center in Virginia.

== Education ==
Low graduated from Langley High School, McLean, Virginia, in 1974; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics-Engineering from Washington &amp; Lee University in 1978, a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1980, and a Master of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University in 1983. He also went to Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University.

== Organizations ==
* Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
* Member of Omicron Delta Kappa
* Member of Phi Kappa Sigma

== Awards and honors ==
* NASA Space Flight Medals (3)
* NASA Exceptional Service Medal
* NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal
* honorary doctorate of engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
* Cygnus Orb-D1 spacecraft, the first Cygnus to travel, was named the S.S. &quot;G. David Low&quot; in his memory. All subsequent Cygnus spacecraft are named for personnel involved in space.

== Aerospace career ==
Low worked in the Spacecraft Systems Engineering Section of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, from March 1980 until June 1984. During that time he was involved in the preliminary planning of several planetary missions, an Autonomous Spacecraft Maintenance study, and the systems engineering design of the Galileo spacecraft. Following a one-year leave to pursue graduate studies, Low returned to JPL where he was the principal spacecraft systems engineer for the Mars Geoscience/Climatology Orbiter (Mars Observer) mission.

== NASA career ==
Selected by NASA in May 1984 as an astronaut candidate, Low became an astronaut in June 1985. He held a variety of technical assignments including work on the Canadarm (RMS), on Extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and Orbiter test and checkout tasks at the Kennedy Space Center. Low served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center during STS Missions 26, 27, 29 and 30. He also served as the lead astronaut in the Man-Systems Group and Station Operations Group of the Space Station Support Office. In 1993, Low was a member of the Russian Integration Team which worked for several months in Crystal City, Virginia to define the changes from the old Space Station Freedom to the new International Space Station. In 1994, he served as the Manager of the EVA Integration and Operations Office, and in 1995 he served as an assistant in the NASA Legislative Affairs Office where he worked with Members of the United States Congress and their staffs to keep them informed about NASA&#x27;s aeronautics and space programs. A veteran of three space flights, Low logged over 714 hours in space, including nearly six hours on a spacewalk. He was a mission specialist on STS-32 (January 9-20, 1990) and STS-43 (August 2-11, 1991), and was the payload commander on STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993).

Low left NASA in February 1996 to pursue an aerospace career with Orbital Sciences Corporation&#x27;s Launch Systems Group in Dulles, Virginia.

== Spaceflight experience ==
On his first mission, Low was a crew member on STS-32 which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 9, 1990. On board the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 communications satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the Canadarm or SRMS. They also operated a variety of middeck materials and life sciences experiments, as well as the IMAX camera. Following 173 orbits of the Earth in 261 hours, &quot;Columbia&quot; returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 20, 1990.

Low next served as the flight engineer aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-43. The nine-day mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 2, 1991. During the flight, crew members deployed the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and life science experiments, mostly relating to the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) and Space Station Freedom. After 142 orbits of the Earth in 213 hours, the mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991.

On STS-57, Low served as payload commander aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary objective of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA) using the Canadarm. Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. During the mission Low, along with crew mate Peter J.K. Wisoff, conducted a 5-hour, 50-minute spacewalk during which the EURECA communications antennas were manually positioned for latching, and various extravehicular activity (EVA) tools and techniques were evaluated for use on future missions. &quot;Endeavour&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 155 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours.

<text>Alfréd Rényi (20 March 1921 – 1 February 1970) was a Hungarian mathematician known for his work in probability theory, though he also made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory.

==Life==
Rényi was born in Budapest to Artúr Rényi and Borbála Alexander; his father was a mechanical engineer, while his mother was the daughter of philosopher and literary critic Bernhard Alexander; his uncle was Franz Alexander, a Hungarian-American psychoanalyst and physician.

He was prevented from enrolling in university in 1939 due to the anti-Jewish laws then in force, but enrolled at the University of Budapest in 1940 and finished his studies in 1944. At this point, he was drafted to forced labour service, from which he managed to escape during transportation of his company. He was in hiding with false documents for six months. Biographers tell an incredible story about Rényi: after half of a year in hiding, he managed to get hold of a soldier&#x27;s uniform and march his parents out of the Budapest Ghetto, where they were captive. That mission required enormous courage and planning skills.

Rényi then completed his PhD in 1947 at the University of Szeged, under the advisement of Frigyes Riesz. He did his postgraduate in Moscow and Leningrad, where he collaborated with a prominent Soviet mathematician Yuri Linnik.

Rényi married Katalin Schulhof (who used Kató Rényi as her married name), herself a mathematician, in 1946; their daughter Zsuzsanna was born in 1948. After a brief assistant professorship at Budapest, he was appointed Professor Extraordinary at the University of Debrecen in 1949. In 1950, he founded the Mathematics Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, now bearing his name, and directed it until his early death. He also headed the Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics of the Eötvös Loránd University, from 1952. He was elected a corresponding member (1949), then full member (1956), of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

==Work==
Rényi proved, using the large sieve, that there is a number formula_1 such that every even number is the sum of a prime number and a number that can be written as the product of at most formula_1 primes. Chen&#x27;s theorem, a strengthening of this result, shows that the theorem is true for &quot;K&quot; = 2, for all sufficiently large even numbers. The case &quot;K&quot; = 1 is the still-unproven Goldbach conjecture.

In information theory, he introduced the spectrum of Rényi entropies of order &quot;α&quot;, giving an important generalisation of the Shannon entropy and the Kullback–Leibler divergence. The Rényi entropies give a spectrum of useful diversity indices, and lead to a spectrum of fractal dimensions. The Rényi–Ulam game is a guessing game where some of the answers may be wrong.

In probability theory, he is also known for his parking constants, which characterize the solution to the following problem: given a street of some length and cars of unit length parking on a random free position on the street, what is the mean density of cars when there are no more free positions? The solution to that problem is asymptotically equal to 0.7475979 . Thus, random parking is 25.2% less efficient than optimal packing.

He wrote 32 joint papers with Paul Erdős, the most well-known of which are his papers introducing the Erdős–Rényi model of random graphs.

The corpus of his bibliography was compiled by the mathematician Pál Medgyessy.

==Quotations==
Rényi, who was addicted to coffee, is the source of the quote: &quot;A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems&quot;, which is often ascribed to Erdős. It has been suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German, where it can be interpreted as a double entendre on the meaning of the word &quot;Satz&quot; (theorem or coffee residue), but it is more likely that the original formulation was in Hungarian.

He is also famous for having said, &quot;If I feel unhappy, I do mathematics to become happy. If I am happy, I do mathematics to keep happy.&quot;

==Remembrance==
The Alfréd Rényi Prize, awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Science, was established in his honor.

In 1950 Rényi founded the Mathematics Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. It was renamed the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics in July 1999.

<doc id="614994" wikidata="Q49035" url="?curid=614994" title="Wendy B. Lawrence">
<text>Wendy Barrien Lawrence (born July 2, 1959) is a retired United States Navy Captain, an engineer, and former helicopter pilot and NASA astronaut. She was the first female graduate of the United States Naval Academy to fly into space and she has also visited the Russian Space Station Mir. She was a mission specialist on STS-114, the first Space Shuttle flight after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. She is married to Cathy Watson, a former NASA scientist.

== Early life ==
Lawrence was born in Jacksonville, Florida. She is the daughter and the granddaughter of naval aviators; her grandfather was noted student-athlete Fatty Lawrence and her father was the late Vice Admiral William P. Lawrence, a Mercury astronaut finalist and a former Vietnam prisoner of war who was Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy and the namesake of the destroyer .

== Education ==
Lawrence graduated from Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 1977. She went on to attend the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science in Ocean Engineering. She later earned a Master of Science in Ocean Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1988, as part of a joint program between the two schools.

== Organizations ==
* Larwance Heights Middle School
* Phi Kappa Phi
* Association of Naval Aviation
* Women Military Aviators
* Naval Helicopter Association
* The Mars Generation

== Military career ==

Lawrence graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1981. A distinguished flight school graduate, she was designated as a Naval Aviator in July 1982. Lawrence has more than 1,500 hours of flight time in six different types of helicopters and has made more than 800 shipboard landings. While assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 6 (HC-6), she was one of the first two female helicopter pilots to make a long deployment to the Indian Ocean as part of a carrier battle group. After completion of a master&#x27;s degree program at MIT and Woods Hole in 1988, she was assigned to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 30 (HSL-30) as Officer-in-charge of Detachment Alpha. In October 1990, Lawrence reported to the U.S. Naval Academy where she served as a physics instructor and the novice women&#x27;s crew coach.

== NASA career ==
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Lawrence reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. She completed one year of training and was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Her technical assignments within the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), Astronaut Office Assistant Training Officer, and Astronaut Office representative for Space Station training and crew support. She flew as the ascent/entry flight engineer and blue shift orbit pilot on STS-67 (March 2–18, 1995). She next served as Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, with responsibility for the coordination and implementation of mission operations activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. In September 1996 she began training as a crew member for a 4-month mission on the Russian Space Station Mir. However, she was replaced by David Wolf due to concerns over minimum size requirements for the Russian Orlan EVA suit. Because of her knowledge and experience with Mir systems and with crew transfer logistics for the Mir, she flew on STS-86 (September 25 to October 6, 1997) and STS-91 (June 2–12, 1998). A veteran of four space flights, she logged over 1,200 hours in space. Lawrence was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-114. She was in charge of the transfer of supplies and equipment and operated the Space Station robotic arm on the Return To Flight mission during which the crew tested and evaluated new procedures for the inspection and repair of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. The mission launched on July 26, 2005, and landed on August 9, 2005.
Captain Lawrence retired from NASA in June 2006.

=== Spaceflight experience ===
STS-67 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (March 2–18, 1995) was the second flight of the ASTRO observatory, a unique complement of three telescopes. During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.

STS-86 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the exchange of U.S. crew members Mike Foale and David Wolf, a spacewalk by Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the STS-76 docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.

STS-91 &quot;Discovery&quot; (June 2–12, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission and marked the conclusion of the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.

STS-114 &quot;Discovery&quot; (July 26 – August 9, 2005) was the first &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission following the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Highlights included the first in-flight repair to the orbiter during a spacewalk. Mission duration was 333 hours, 33 minutes.

<text>Pál Turán (; 18 August 1910 – 26 September 1976) also known as Paul Turán, was a Hungarian mathematician who worked primarily in extremal combinatorics. 

In 1940, because of his Jewish origins, he was arrested by the Nazis and sent to a labour camp in Transylvania, later being transferred several times to other camps. While imprisoned, Turán came up with some of his best theories, which he was able to publish after the war. 

Turán had a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős, lasting 46 years and resulting in 28 joint papers.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===

Turán was born into a Hungarian Jewish family in Budapest on 18 August 1910. Pál&#x27;s outstanding mathematical abilities showed early, already in secondary school he was the best student.

At the same period of time, Turán and Pál Erdős were famous answerers in the journal &quot;KöMaL&quot;. On 1 September 1930, at a mathematical seminar at the University of Budapest, Turan met Erdős. They would collaborate for 46 years and produce 28 scientific papers together.

Turán received a teaching degree at the University of Budapest in 1933. In the same year he published two major scientific papers in the journals of the American and London Mathematical Societies. He got the PhD degree under Lipót Fejér in 1935 at Eötvös Loránd University.

As a Jew, he fell victim to numerus clausus, and could not get a stable job for several years. He made a living as a tutor, preparing applicants and students for exams. It was not until 1938 that he got a job at a rabbinical training school in Budapest as a teacher&#x27;s assistant, by which time he had already had 16 major scientific publications and an international reputation as one of Hungary&#x27;s leading mathematicians.

He married Edit (Klein) Kóbor in 1939; they had one son, Róbert.

=== In World War II ===

In September 1940 Turán was interned in labour service. As he recalled later, his five years in labour camps eventually saved his life: they saved him from ending up in a concentration camp, where 550,000 of the 770,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered during World War II. In 1940 Turán ended up in Transylvania for railway construction. Turán said that one day while working another prisoner addressed him by his surname, saying that he was working extremely clumsily:
:&quot;An officer was standing nearby, watching us work. When he heard my name, he asked the comrade whether I was a mathematician. It turned out, that the officer, Joshef Winkler, was an engineer. In his youth, he had placed in a mathematical competition; in civilian life he was a proof-reader at the print shop where the periodical of the Third Class of the Academy (Mathematical and Natural sciences) was printed. There he had seen some of my manuscripts.&quot;

Winkler wanted to help Turán and managed to get him transferred to an easier job. Turán was sent to the sawmill&#x27;s warehouse, where he had to show the carriers the right-sized timbers. During this period, Turán composed and was partly able to record a long paper on the Riemann zeta function.

Turán was subsequently transferred several times to other camps. As he later recalled, the only way he was able to keep his sanity was through mathematics, solving problems in his head and thinking through problems.

In July 1944 Turán worked on a brick factory near Budapest. His and the other prisoners&#x27; task was to carry the brick cars from the kilns to the warehouses on rails that crossed at several points with other tracks. At these crossings the trolleys would &quot;bounce&quot; and some of the bricks would fall out, causing a lot of problems for the workers. This situation led Turan to consider how to achieve the minimum number of crossings for m kilns and n warehouses. It was only after the war, in 1952, that he was able to work seriously on this problem.

Turán was liberated in 1944, after which he was able to return to work at the rabbinical school in Budapest.

=== After WWII ===
Turán became associate professor at the University of Budapest in 1945 and full professor in 1949. In the early post-war years, the streets were patrolled by soldiers. On occasion, random people were seized and sent to penal camps in Siberia. Once such a patrol stopped Turan, who was on his way home from university. The soldiers questioned the mathematician and then forced him to show them the contents of his briefcase. Seeing a reprint of an article from a pre-War Soviet magazine among the papers, the soldiers immediately let the mathematician go. The only thing Turán said about that day in his correspondence with Erdös was that he had &quot;come across an extremely interesting way of applying number theory...&quot;

In 1952 he married again, the second marriage was to Vera Sós, a mathematician. They had a son, György, in 1953. The couple published several papers together.

One of his students said Turán was a very passionate and active man - in the summer he held maths seminars by the pool in between his swimming and rowing training. In 1960 he celebrated his 50th birthday and the birth of his third son, Tamás, by swimming across the Danube.

Turán was a member of the editorial boards of leading mathematical journals, he worked as a visiting professor at many of the top universities in the world. He was a member of the Polish, American and Austrian Mathematical Societies. In 1970, he was invited to serve on the committee of the Fields Prize. Turán also founded and served as the president of the János Bolyai Mathematical Society.

===Death===

Around 1970 Turán was diagnosed with leukaemia, but the diagnosis was revealed only to his wife Vera Sós, who decided not to tell him about his illness. In 1976 she told Erdős. Sós was sure that Turán was ‘too much in love with life’ and would have fallen into despair at the news of his fatal illness, and would not have been able to work properly. Erdős said that Turán did not lose his spirit even in the Nazi camps and did brilliant work there. Erdős regretted that Turán had been kept unaware of his illness because he had put off certain works and books &#x27;for later&#x27;, hoping that he would soon feel better, and in the end was never able to finish them. Turán died in Budapest on 26 September 1976 of leukemia, aged 66.

==Work==
Turán worked primarily in number theory, but also did much work in analysis and graph theory.

===Number theory===
In 1934, Turán used the Turán sieve to give a new and very simple proof of a 1917 result of G. H. Hardy and Ramanujan on the normal order of the number of distinct prime divisors of a number &quot;n&quot;, namely that it is very close to formula_1. In probabilistic terms he estimated the variance from formula_1. Halász says &quot;Its true significance lies in the fact that it was the starting point of probabilistic number theory&quot;. The Turán–Kubilius inequality is a generalization of this work.

Turán was very interested in the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, and he coined the term &quot;prime number race&quot; for irregularities in the distribution of prime numbers among residue classes. With his coauthor Knapowski he proved results concerning Chebyshev&#x27;s bias. The Erdős–Turán conjecture makes a statement about primes in arithmetic progression. Much of Turán&#x27;s number theory work dealt with the Riemann hypothesis and he developed the power sum method (see below) to help with this. Erdős said &quot;Turán was an &#x27;unbeliever,&#x27; in fact, a &#x27;pagan&#x27;: he did not believe in the truth of Riemann&#x27;s hypothesis.&quot;

===Analysis===
Much of Turán&#x27;s work in analysis was tied to his number theory work. Outside of this he proved Turán&#x27;s inequalities relating the values of the Legendre polynomials for different indices, and, together with Paul Erdős, the Erdős–Turán equidistribution inequality.

===Graph theory===
Erdős wrote of Turán, &quot;In 1940–1941 he created the area of extremal problems in graph theory which is now one of the fastest-growing subjects in combinatorics.&quot; The field is known more briefly today as extremal graph theory. Turán&#x27;s best-known result in this area is Turán&#x27;s graph theorem, that gives an upper bound on the number of edges in a graph that does not contain the complete graph &quot;Kr&quot; as a subgraph. He invented the Turán graph, a generalization of the complete bipartite graph, to prove his theorem. He is also known for the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem bounding the number of edges that can exist in a bipartite graph with certain forbidden subgraphs, and for raising Turán&#x27;s brick factory problem, namely of determining the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph.

===Power sum method===
Turán developed the power sum method to work on the Riemann hypothesis. The method deals with inequalities giving lower bounds for sums of the form
:formula_3 hence the name &quot;power sum&quot;.

Aside from its applications in analytic number theory, it has been used in complex analysis, numerical analysis, differential equations, transcendental number theory, and estimating the number of zeroes of a function in a disk.

<text>Steven Wayne Lindsey (born August 24, 1960) is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and NASA astronaut. Lindsey served as Chief of the NASA Astronaut Office from September 2006 until October 2009.

==Early life and education==

Lindsey was born on August 24, 1960, in Arcadia, California. He graduated from Temple City High School in 1978. Lindsey is an Eagle Scout from Troop 161. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Sciences from the United States Air Force Academy in 1982, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology of Air University in 1990.

==Military career==
Lindsey was commissioned a Second Lieutenant at the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1982. In 1983, after receiving his pilot wings at Reese Air Force Base, Texas, he qualified in the RF-4C Phantom II and was assigned to the 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. From 1984 until 1987, he served as a combat-ready pilot, instructor pilot, and academic instructor at Bergstrom. In 1987, he was selected to attend graduate school at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where he studied Aeronautical Engineering.

In 1989, Lindsey attended the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In 1990, he was assigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where he conducted weapons and systems tests in F-16 and F-4 aircraft. While a member of the 3247th Test Squadron, Lindsey served as the Deputy Director, Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System Joint Test Force and as the squadron&#x27;s F-16 Flight Commander. In August 1993, he was selected to attend Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Upon graduation in June 1994, he was reassigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as an Integrated Product Team leader in the USAF SEEK EAGLE Office where he was responsible for Air Force weapons certification for the F-16, F-111, A-10, and F-117 aircraft. In March 1995, he was assigned to NASA as an astronaut candidate.

Lindsey has logged over 7,000 hours of flying time in more than 50 different types of aircraft.

==NASA career==

Lindsey was selected by NASA in March 1995. He became an astronaut in May 1996, qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Initially assigned to flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), Lindsey also served as the Astronaut Office representative working on the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS) program, a glass cockpit Space Shuttle upgrade program, as well as a number of other advanced upgrade projects. In between his first two flights, he worked as the Shuttle Landing and Rollout representative responsible for training flight crews and testing orbiter landing techniques and flying qualities. After his second flight, Lindsey served as Deputy for Shuttle Operations and Co-Chairman of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Council, responsible for designing, testing, and implementing crew interfaces and displays for the $400 million Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade. More recently, he served as the Chief of International Space Station Operations for the astronaut office, responsible for integrating astronaut, civil service, and contractor activities in providing support to all aspects of the development, testing, crew training and operations of the International Space Station. After the completion of STS-121, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office. In this position, Steven also flew weather reconnaissance in the Shuttle Training Aircraft during the launch or landing of a Space Shuttle. Lindsey ceded his position as Chief of the Astronaut Office to astronaut Peggy Whitson when he was selected for STS-133.

==Spaceflight experience==

Lindsey has flown five missions in space for NASA. He served as pilot of STS-87 (1997) and STS-95 (1998) and commander of STS-104 (2001), STS-121 (2006) and STS-133 (2011).

STS-87 (November 19 to December 5, 1997) was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun’s outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) that featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, and tested EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. During the EVA, Lindsey piloted the first flight of the AERCam Sprint, a free-flying robotic camera. The mission was accomplished in 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.

STS-95 (October 29 to November 7, 1998) was a 9-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of research payloads including deployment and retrieval of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes.

STS-104 (July 12 to July 24, 2001), designated assembly mission 7A, was the 10th mission to the International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition 2 crew and performed three spacewalks to install the ISS Joint Airlock Quest and to outfit it with four high-pressure gas tanks. In addition to installing and activating the Joint Airlock, the crew also performed the first spacewalk from Quest. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits.

STS-121 (July 4 to July 17, 2006) was an ISS visit and space shuttle checkout mission. It was the second flight after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster (STS-107) and was considered one of the two Return to Flight test missions before resumption of normal shuttle operations. Lindsey served as mission commander on the flight.

STS-133 (February 24 to March 9, 2011) was the last flight for Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;.

A veteran of five space flights, Lindsey has logged over 1,500 hours in space.

==Awards and honors==
Lindsey is a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training (1983). He is also a distinguished graduate and recipient of the Liethen-Tittle Award as the outstanding test pilot of the USAF Test Pilot School Class 89A (1989). He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 3 NASA Space Flight Medals, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Air Force Achievement Medal and the Aerial Achievement Medal. He is an inductee into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.

Lindsey is a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, of the USAF Academy Association of Graduates, and of the Association of Space Explorers.

Lindsey is a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award which was presented to him by the San Gabriel Valley Council, Boy Scouts of America on November 10, 2012, on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America.

==Personal life==
Lindsey lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife, Diane Renee Lindsey (née Trujillo).

<doc id="615004" wikidata="Q1148237" url="?curid=615004" title="Just Push Play">
<text>Just Push Play is the thirteenth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, co-produced by song collaborators Marti Frederiksen and Mark Hudson and was released on March 5, 2001. &quot;Just Push Play&quot; debuted at No. 2 within the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 240,000 copies in its first week, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America within a month of its release.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Jaded&quot;, became a Top 10 hit in the US and around the world. Subsequent singles &quot;Fly Away from Here&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, though garnering some airplay, failed to impact the Hot 100, although the latter two reached the US Mainstream Rock chart and the former appeared within the Adult Top 40.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s cover, which was designed by Hajime Sorayama, features a gynoid resembling Marilyn Monroe. The illustration had already been used for the cover of a compilation album of various artists hits called &quot;Video Sound&quot;, released in 1985, and which did not include any Aerosmith songs.

Several songs were recorded for the album that went unused. &quot;Ain&#x27;t It True&quot;, &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Innocent Man&quot;, &quot;I Love You Down&quot;, &quot;We Love To Say This&quot;, &quot;Sweet Due&quot; and &quot;Zorro&quot; can be linked as originating from these sessions. &quot;Angel&#x27;s Eye&quot; was used for the soundtrack to the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot; were issued as bonus tracks on later pressings of the album. The track &quot;Do You Wonder&quot; was supposedly recorded for this album, as well.

In 2010, guitarist Joe Perry criticized the album:

==Critical reception==

Metacritic gave the album 65 out of 100 based on 14 generally favorable reviews.

For his review of &quot;Just Push Play&quot; for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that it was their best-sounding album in the past decade, as well as &quot;tighter, savvier, and better&quot; than anything since their 1989 album &quot;Pump&quot;, but it was not much compared to &quot;Pump&quot; and its 1987 predecessor, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;. He felt it lacked anything memorable, and the band&#x27;s &quot;refusal to act their age results in a couple of embarrassing slips into stodginess&quot;.

Darryl Stredan strongly disliked the album, to the point that he considered it proof that Aerosmith should stop making new music. Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;good but not great&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; said that while most of the album is not new, it was their first to feature rap metal with songs like &quot;Just Push Play&quot; and &quot;Outta Your Head&quot;.

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;Just Push Play&quot; was the closest Aerosmith had come to a &quot;great album&quot; since 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rocks&quot;, despite the &quot;weak spots&quot; of the album&#x27;s power ballads. Robert Christgau picked out the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Jaded&quot;, as a choice cut.

The album was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 2001, including Best Rock Album &quot;(Just Push Play&quot;), Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group (&quot;Jaded&quot;), and Best Short Form Music Video (&quot;Fly Away from Here&quot;).

==Track listing==

==Career==
After graduating from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine in June 1985, Linnehan entered private veterinary practice and was later accepted to a two-year joint internship in zoo animal medicine and comparative pathology at the Baltimore Zoo and Johns Hopkins University. After completing his internship, Linnehan was commissioned as a captain in the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps and reported for duty in early 1989 at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, San Diego, California, as chief clinical veterinarian for the U.S. Navy’s Marine Mammal Program. During his assignment at the Naval Ocean Systems Center, Linnehan initiated and supervised research in the areas of cetacean and pinniped anesthesia, orthopedics, drug pharmacokinetics and reproduction in direct support of U.S. Navy mobile marine mammal systems stationed in California, Florida, and Hawaii.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Linnehan reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992 where he completed one year of astronaut candidate training, qualifying him for Space Shuttle flight assignments as a mission specialist. Linnehan was initially assigned to flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). He was subsequently assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, working on payload development, and mission development flight support for future Space Shuttle missions. He first flew as a mission specialist in 1996 on STS-78, the Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission. In 1998, he served as the payload commander on the STS-90 Neurolab mission. In 2002, he was a member of the four-man EVA crew on STS-109 the fourth Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. In 2008, he was the lead spacewalker on [(STS-123)] 1JA, an ISS assembly mission where he performed three EVAs and supervised the remaining two during the installation of the JEM module and Canadian SPDM. A veteran of four space flights, Linnehan has logged over 59 days in space, including six EVAs (spacewalks) totaling 42 hours and 11 minutes.

As of 2020, Linnehan is a management astronaut and no longer eligible for NASA Space flight assignments. Dr. Linnehan splits his time between the Astronaut Office Exploration and Integration branches and the NASA Institutional Review Board (IRB) and JSC Institutional, and NASA Flight, Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-78 LMS (June 20 to July 7, 1996). The Life Sciences and Microgravity Spacelab mission was flown aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The 17-day flight included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life sciences payload. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, and covered in 405 hours and 48 minutes.

STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 to May 3, 1998) was Linnehan&#x27;s second Spacelab mission. During the 16-day flight the seven-person crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; served as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. STS-90 orbited the Earth 256 times, and covered in 381 hours and 50 minutes. Both missions served as a model for future life sciences studies on board the International Space Station.

STS-109 HST Servicing Mission 3B (March 1 to March 12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission and Linnehan&#x27;s third flight aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s systems over the course of five consecutive EVAs, leaving it with a new power control unit, improved solar arrays, the new Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and an experimental refrigeration unit for cooling the dormant Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). With his teammate John Grunsfeld, Linnehan performed three of the five spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times and covered in just over 262 hours.

STS-123 (March 11 to March 26, 2008) was Linnehan&#x27;s fourth spaceflight, and his first aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission delivered the Japanese Logistics Module and the Canadian Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator to the International Space Station. Linnehan performed three of the five scheduled spacewalks on STS-123 with Garrett Reisman, Mike Foreman and Bob Behnken.

<text>Fred Weldon Leslie is an American scientist who flew on the NASA STS-73 Space Shuttle mission as a payload specialist.

==Background==
Leslie was born on December 19, 1951, in Ancón, Panama. He is an instrument rated commercial pilot with more than 900 hours in various aircraft. Leslie graduated from Irving High School, Irving, Texas, in 1970, then received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering science from The University of Texas in 1974, and a master&#x27;s degree and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in meteorology with a minor in fluid mechanics from the University of Oklahoma in 1977 and 1979, respectively. Leslie served on the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Fluid Dynamics Technical Committee, he is a member of the American Meteorological Society, Tau Beta Pi, Chi Epsilon Pi, and the United States Parachute Association. He holds a World Record as a participant in the 200 person freefall formation set October 1992.

==Academic career==
After Leslie earned his Ph.D. in 1979, he served as a post doctoral research associate at Purdue University studying fluid vortex dynamics. In 1980, he worked for the Universities Space Research Association as a visiting scientist at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).

== NASA career==
Leslie began work for NASA in 1980 as a research scientist in the Space Science Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Since 1983, he has served as a co-investigator for the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell experiment which examines spherical rotating convection relevant to the atmospheres of stars and planets. The experiment flew on Spacelab 3 and is also a part of the United States Microgravity Laboratory-2 (USML-2) payload. Leslie was a principal investigator for the Fluid Interface and Bubble Experiment examining the behavior of a rotating free surface aboard NASA&#x27;s KC-135 aircraft flying low-gravity trajectories. He is an author on 27 journal papers, 45 conference papers, and nine NASA reports involving atmospheric and fluid dynamic phenomena. Leslie also worked in the MSFC Neutral Buoyancy Simulator as a suited subject and safety diver supporting procedure tests for extra-vehicular activity.

In 1987, he became chief of the Fluid Dynamics Branch where he directed and conducted research in both laboratory and theoretical investigations along with more than a dozen scientists in the Branch. He was also the mission scientist for Spacelab J (STS-47) coordinating more than 40 domestic and Japanese experiments in fluid dynamics, crystal growth, and life science during the 8-day mission.

Leslie is a researcher at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He is a member of the research team analyzing data from the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell experiment that flew on STS-73/USML-2.

==Spaceflight==
Leslie flew as a payload specialist on STS-73 launched on October 20, 1995, and landed at the Kennedy Space Center on November 5, 1995. The 16-day mission aboard Space Shuttle Columbia focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and fluid physics contained within the pressurized Spacelab module.

<text>Roland Kent LaVoie (born July 31, 1943), better known by his stage name Lobo (which is Spanish for wolf), is an American singer-songwriter who was successful in the 1970s, scoring several U.S. Top 10 hits including &quot;Me and You and a Dog Named Boo&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Love You to Want Me&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Expect Me to Be Your Friend&quot;. These three songs, along with &quot;Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love&quot;, gave Lobo four chart toppers on the Easy Listening/Hot Adult Contemporary chart.

==Career==
===1961–1970: Early years===
Born in Tallahassee, Florida, LaVoie was raised by his mother in Winter Haven, Florida, with his six siblings. He began his musical career in 1961 as a member of a local band, The Rumours. The band included Gram Parsons and Jim Stafford, as well as drummer Jon Corneal, who later joined Parsons&#x27;s International Submarine Band.

In 1964, while attending the University of South Florida, LaVoie joined a band called the Sugar Beats and met producer Phil Gernhard. He recorded a regional hit for the band, a cover of Johnny Rivers&#x27;s song, &quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot;

During the 1960s, LaVoie performed with many other bands, including US Male, The Uglies, and Me and the Other Guys. It was in the latter band that he met musician Billy Aerts, who became a member of Lobo&#x27;s touring band in the early 1970s and produced Lobo&#x27;s comeback album in 1989.

Again working with Gernhard, his first solo record was released in 1969 on Laurie Records. It included the original tracks &quot;Happy Days in New York City&quot; backed with &quot;My Friend Is Here&quot;.

===1971–1975: Success with Big Tree===
By 1971, LaVoie had started calling himself Lobo (Spanish for wolf). Gernhard was an executive for Big Tree Records, and the company released his first single, &quot;Me and You and a Dog Named Boo&quot;, in March 1971. The first major hit for the label, it reached No. 5 in the US and No. 4 in the UK by May, launching a successful series of singles. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc in September 1971.

His debut album, &quot;Introducing Lobo&quot;, came in May 1971. In June his second single, &quot;She Didn&#x27;t Do Magic&quot;, was released. In September, &quot;California Kid and Reemo&quot; was released, followed by &quot;The Albatross&quot;. When Big Tree Records merged with Bell Records, Lobo&#x27;s second project album &quot;Close Up&quot; was never released.

Under the Lobo alias, he then released &quot;Of a Simple Man&quot; in 1972, which included back-to-back U.S. Top 10 hits, including &quot;I&#x27;d Love You to Want Me&quot; (No. 2, November 18–25, 1972) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Expect Me to Be Your Friend&quot; (No. 8, February 17–24, 1973). The former became Lobo&#x27;s biggest hit, a million-seller gaining gold disc status in November 1972 and internationally reaching No. 1 in Germany in December 1973 and No. 5 in the United Kingdom in July 1974.

With the release of &quot;Calumet&quot; in 1973, Lobo had three more Top 40 hits: &quot;It Sure Took a Long, Long Time&quot;, &quot;How Can I Tell Her&quot;, and &quot;Standing at the End of the Line&quot;. He made an appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; that year. There were two further minor hit singles from the album: &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot; and &quot;Love Me for What I Am&quot;.

In June 1974 Lobo&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Just a Singer&quot;, was released. It was the first album by Lobo to contain tracks not written by him. The only single from the album was &quot;Rings&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Goodnight&quot; in 1975 became his last Top 30 single for Big Tree. Lobo also released the album, &quot;A Cowboy Afraid of Horses&quot;, with &quot;Would I Still Have You&quot; released as a single. The label followed it up with a compilation album that year entitled &quot;The Best of Lobo&quot;.

===1976–1985: Curb Records, and move to Nashville===
In 1976 Lobo broke away from Big Tree, releasing the album &quot;Come with Me&quot; in Europe on the Philips label. &quot;At First Sight&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Everywhere&quot; were the singles. Neither was released in the US.

Lobo signed with Curb Records in 1977, releasing the single &quot;Afterglow&quot;, co-produced by Lobo and Gernhard, and in 1978 &quot;You Are All I&#x27;ll Ever Need&quot;. No full-length album materialized from these sessions.

In 1979 Lobo was signed to Curb/MCA Records, where he worked with producer Bob Montgomery, releasing the single &quot;Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love&quot;, which reached No. 23. The song also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. He also released his first US album in four years, &quot;Lobo&quot;. Other singles for Curb were &quot;Holding On for Dear Love&quot;, &quot;With a Love Like Ours&quot;, and &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;.

Reportedly dissatisfied with the production of his records, Lobo sought a release from his Curb contract. He moved to Nashville and, in 1981, started his own label, Lobo Records, releasing several singles including &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Want You&quot; (written by his brother, Roger LaVoie), &quot;Come Looking for Me&quot;, and &quot;Living My Life Without You&quot;, all of which charted in the country charts. He also released &quot;Bull Smith Can&#x27;t Dance the Cotton Eye Joe&quot; with the group Wolfpack, which included Narvel Felts and Kenny Earl.

Lobo Records was renamed Evergreen Records in 1985. The label released two of his singles: &quot;Am I Going Crazy&quot; and &quot;Paint the Town Blue&quot;, the latter a duet with Robin Lee.

===1987–present: Asian popularity and recent years===
Although he is far less followed now in the United States, Lobo&#x27;s popularity grew in Asia, fanned by the release of his greatest hits compilations in 1987 and 1988. This encouraged him to release in 1989 his first new album in 10 years, entitled &quot;Am I Going Crazy&quot;. It was recorded in Taiwan on UFO/WEA Records and was produced by Billy Aerts. He signed a multi-album deal with PonyCanyon Records in Singapore, and in 1994 released &quot;Asian Moon&quot;, repackaging some of the tracks from &quot;Am I Going Crazy&quot; along with newly recorded material. His follow-up album &quot;Classic Hits&quot; in 1995 were re-recordings of Lobo hits and some cover versions. In 1996 he released the album &quot;Sometimes&quot;, containing all new original songs.

On another Asian label, Springroll Entertainment, he released &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; in 1997, an album of pop standards that was released in two formats, one with vocals and the other with instrumental tracks.

In 2000, Lobo signed with a German record company, Gmbh Entertainment, and recorded a few tracks for various hits CDs. He also co-wrote two Christmas songs with Billy Aerts, &quot;A Big Kid&#x27;s Christmas&quot; and &quot;Late Christmas Eve&quot;, which have been released on various Christmas compilations from 2000 to present. Singles recorded during this period include &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Different Drum&quot;.

In 2006, based on his Asian popularity, he toured in Southeast Asia. In 2008, Lobo released &quot;Out of Time&quot; with old favorites and some new songs. A tribute album to the original era of the early Lobo recordings was made available from the website.

<doc id="615049" wikidata="Q5050279" url="?curid=615049" title="Castle Rock State Park (California)">
<text>Castle Rock State Park is a state park of California, United States, located along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains and almost entirely in Santa Cruz County, with parts extending into Santa Clara County and San Mateo County. It embraces coast redwood, Douglas fir, and madrone forest, most of which has been left in its wild, natural state. Steep canyons are sprinkled with unusual rock formations that are a popular rock climbing area. The park is named after a sandstone formation called Castle Rock. The forest here is lush and mossy, crisscrossed by of hiking trails. These trails are part of an even more extensive trail system that links the Santa Clara and San Lorenzo valleys with Castle Rock State Park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, and the Pacific Coast. Due to its overnight parking lot, Castle Rock is a popular starting point for the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, a trail that begins near by at Saratoga Gap and leads to Waddell Beach north of Santa Cruz. There are two walk-in campgrounds within the park for overnight backpacking.

== Location ==
The entrance to Castle Rock State Park is located on California State Route 35 (Skyline Boulevard) southeast of the junction with State Route 9. The park is adjacent to Sanborn County Park (across State Route 35) and the Los Altos Rod and Gun Club Range.

== Usage and activities ==
Castle Rock State Park is suitable for many activities. There are two walk-in campgrounds for overnight hikers, many trails for day-hikes, rock climbing routes, and picnic areas. Dogs are not allowed on the trails or in the campgrounds, and horses allowed only on designated trails.

== History ==
The park was established in 1968.

Under Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s 2011 budget proposal this park was going to close. This would have meant that visitors couldn&#x27;t enter the park, and rangers would no longer staff the park.

California Assembly Bill 42 was signed into law on October 5, 2011. This bill allows state parks to enter into operating agreements with non-profit organizations. The Portola and Castle Rock Foundation has been formed to help support Portola and Castle Rock State Parks.

On March 14, 2012 the park was removed from the state park closure list for a one-year reprieve based on a $250,000 donation by the Sempervirens Fund.

On August 1, 2019, a new park entrance opened, featuring Wi-Fi, picnic areas, 90 parking spaces, and an amphitheater. This parking lot was funded by an 8.7 million dollar donation from the Sempervirens Fund.

<doc id="615057" wikidata="Q191792" url="?curid=615057" title="Bayan-Ölgii Province">
<text>Bayan-Ölgii ( ) is the westernmost of the 21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia. The country&#x27;s only Muslim and Kazakh-majority aimag, it was established in August 1940. Its capital is Ölgii.

== Geography ==
The aimag is located in the extreme west of the country, and shares borders with both Russia and China. The border between the two neighbouring countries is very short here, though, and ends after about 40 km at the eastern end of Kazakhstan. Within Mongolia, the neighbouring aimags are Uvs in the north east and Khovd in the south east.

Bayan-Ölgii is the highest Mongolian aimag. For the most part it is located in the Mongolian Altay, at the transition point to the Russian Altay. About 10% of the territory is covered by forests, consisting primarily of Siberian Larch.

The Nairamdal Peak (also &quot;Friendship Peak&quot;, Chinese: &quot;Youyi Feng&quot;) of the Altai Tavan Bogd (&quot;five saints mountain&quot;) massif mountain marks the corner between the three neighbouring countries. About 2.5 km further south on the Mongolian-Chinese border, the Khüiten Peak is the highest point of Mongolia at a height of 4,374 m. The massif includes several glaciers, such as the 19 km Potanin Glacier, and is only accessible to experienced climbers with local guidance.

The Khovd River (the longest in the western Mongolian Great Lakes Depression) has its origin in this aimag. It is fed by the three lakes &quot;Khoton&quot;, &quot;Khurgan&quot;, and &quot;Dayan&quot;, and in turn feeds the lake Khar-Us in the Khovd Aimag. The Tolbo Lake is a large saline lake about 50 km south of the aimag capital. It features clear and cold water on an elevation of 2,080 m.

===National parks===
The &quot;Altai Tavan Bogd National Park&quot; covers 6,362 km² and is located south of the highest mountain of Mongolia. It includes the lakes &quot;Khoton&quot;, &quot;Khurgan&quot;, and &quot;Dayan&quot;. The protected area offers a home for many species of alpine animal, such as the Argali sheep, Ibex, Red deer, Beech marten, Moose, Snow cock, and Golden eagle.

The &quot;Khökh Serkhiin Nuruu Protected Area&quot; (659 km²) and the &quot;Siilkhemiin Nuruu National Park&quot; (1,428 km²) are of similar character.

The &quot;Develiin Aral Natural Reserve&quot; (103 km²) is established around &quot;Develiin Island&quot; at the confluence of the rivers &quot;Lsan Khooloi&quot; and &quot;Khovd&quot;. Since 2000 it has provided protection for various birds and animals including pheasants, boars, and beavers.

The &quot;Tsambagarav Uul National Park&quot; includes 1,115 km² of land around the glaciers near the Khovd aimag and protects the snow leopards living there, among others.

==Demographics==

Most inhabitants of Bayan-Ölgii are Kazakhs (93%). The rest of the population is composed of Uriankhai, Dörvöd, Khalkha, Tsengel Tuvans, and Khoshuud. A significant portion of the population speaks Kazakh as their mother tongue and the Mongolian language only as a second language, if at all.

After democratization, many inhabitants moved to their historical homeland, Kazakhstan, assuming they would find a better future there. The result was a noticeable loss of population in 1991–1993, when approximately 80 thousand repatriated to Kazakhstan. A noticeable number of former immigrants have been returning, so that the population has risen again.

== Culture ==
The culture of the Kazakh majority is strongly influenced by Islamic traditions. The mosque of Ölgii also houses the Islamic Center of Mongolia. It is placed at an unusual angle within the fabric of the city, because the building was oriented exactly towards Mecca. There is also a &quot;madrasah&quot; (Islamic school) at the same place.

The aimag is famous for the traditional practice of hunting with trained eagles. The captive eagles work in a similar way as hunting falcons do. While eagles are used for hunting in other parts of the world, particularly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the practice is most common in Bayan-Ölgii, where an estimated 80 percent of the world&#x27;s eagle hunters live. The annual Golden Eagle Festival is held in Ölgii every October to display the skill of eagle hunters, with about 70 hunters participating per year.

== Administrative subdivisions ==


* – Tsagaannuur including

==Economy==
The main economy activity of the province is animal husbandry. In 2022, there were 2.3 million head of livestock in the province. In 2010, the GDP of the province is divided into agriculture (45%), services (40.2%) and industry (14.8%). In 2018, the province contributed to 1.15% of the total national GDP of Mongolia.

<text>The ESPY Awards (short for Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards, and often referred to as the ESPYs) is an annual American awards show produced by ESPN since 1993, recognizing individual and team athletic achievement and other sports-related performance during the calendar year preceding a given annual ceremony. From 2015 to 2019, and since 2021, the ceremony has aired live on sister broadcast television network ABC, while ESPN continues to air them in the form of replays. Because of the ceremony&#x27;s rescheduling prior to the 2002 iteration thereof, awards presented in 2002 were for achievement and performances during the seventeen-plus previous months. As the similarly styled Grammy (for music), Emmy (for television), Academy Award (for film), and Tony (for theater), the ESPYs are hosted by a contemporary celebrity; the style, though, is lighter, more relaxed and self-referential than many other awards shows, with comedic sketches usually included.

From the show&#x27;s inception to 2004, ESPY Award winners were chosen only through voting by fans. Since 2004, sportswriters, broadcasters, sports executives, and sportspersons, collectively experts; or ESPN personalities also vote. Award winners have been selected thereafter exclusively through global online fan balloting conducted from amongst candidates selected by the ESPY Select Nominating Committee.

==Charitable role==
A portion of the proceeds from sales of tickets to the event devolves on the V Foundation, a charity established by collegiate basketball coach and television commentator Jim Valvano to promote cancer research. Valvano announced the creation of the charitable foundation during his acceptance of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the inaugural ESPY telecast on March 3, 1993, 55 days before Valvano&#x27;s death from metastatic adenocarcinoma.

==Design==
The ESPY Award statuette was designed and created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan. The statuette consists of a silver sphere, with the word &quot;ESPY&quot; engraved on it, mounted on a silver pedestal.

==Ceremonies==

===Timing===
Between 1993 and 2001, the ceremony was held each year in either February or March and was broadcast recorded on ESPN.

Between 2002 and 2019 and from 2022 to 2023, the ceremony was held on the Wednesday in July following the Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game, as it marks the only day of the year on which none of the major North American professional leagues nor college sports programs have games scheduled. The National Basketball Association, National Football League, and National Hockey League are not in-season (though the NBA&#x27;s post-draft training camp NBA Summer League is taking place and NFL teams are getting ready for training camp), colleges are in recess for the summer, and MLB does not contest games on the day following its all-star game. Thus, major sports figures (except for those in cycling, which has the Tour de France; minor league baseball; and golf, where The Open Championship usually starts that evening) are available to attend. The show aired on the subsequent Sunday four days later, although the results were reported publicly by ESPN.com.

In 2024, the ceremony was conducted on the second Thursday of July.

In 2010, the ceremony was aired live by ESPN for the first time since 2003. In 2015, the ESPY Awards moved to network television, airing on ESPN&#x27;s corporate sister network ABC.

===Location===
The first seven editions of the ESPYs were held in New York City—in 1993 and 1994 at Madison Square Garden and from 1995 through 1999, at Radio City Music Hall. The awards relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, for two years beginning in 2000, and ultimately settled at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California. In 2006, it was announced that the awards would move in 2008 to the Peacock Theater (formerly the Microsoft Theater), to be situated as the West Coast headquarters of ESPN at LA Live, adjacent to the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, California.

===Hosts===
The ceremonies have been hosted variously by comedians, television and film actors, and sportspeople. American film actor Samuel L. Jackson is the only individual to have hosted four times (in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2009). Comedian Dennis Miller, actor and singer Jamie Foxx, and talk show host and comedian Seth Meyers are the only others to have hosted the show more than once.

===Year-by-year===
==Awards==
American professional golfer Tiger Woods is the most-honored ESPY recipient, having received 21 awards.

<text>Pádraig Faulkner (12 March 1918 – 1 June 2012) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1980 to 1981, Minister for Defence 1979 to 1980, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Tourism and Transport from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Education from 1969 to 1973, Minister for the Gaeltacht and Minister for Lands from 1968 to 1969 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1965 to 1968. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Louth constituency from 1957 to 1987.

Faulkner was born in Dundalk, County Louth, in 1918. He was educated at Dundalk CBS and St Patrick&#x27;s College of Education in Drumcondra, Dublin, where he qualified as a national school teacher. Faulkner grew up in Dunleer in south Louth, where his father was a strong supporter of Fine Gael, while his mother supported the more Republican and working-class Fianna Fáil. He favoured his mother&#x27;s political outlook and joined Fianna Fáil. Faulkner unsuccessfully contested the Louth by-election in 1954 but at the 1957 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann winning a second seat for the party with Frank Aiken as they returned to Government.

In 1965, Faulkner was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht by the Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. He was appointed to the Cabinet by the new Taoiseach Jack Lynch in 1968 and served in every Fianna Fáil-led government until 1980. During the Arms Crisis he was a Lynch loyalist. He was one of a number of TDs and Senators who gathered in Dublin Airport to welcome Lynch home from the United States after the defendants had been found not guilty at the Arms Trial. This gathering has been arranged by his constituency colleague, Frank Aiken. Nine years later in 1979 one of those defendants, Charles J. Haughey, was elected Taoiseach. Faulkner was retained in the Cabinet until 1980 as Minister of Defence when he was elected Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann. It was rumoured by various political correspondents that George Colley insisted that he personally appoint the Ministers for Defence and Justice in the 1979 Cabinet. Faulkner rebuts this succinctly in his autobiography. Indeed Haughey as a former Army Officer took offence to that claim from certain sections of the media that he would subvert the Army as his father had died as an Army Officer himself. 

Faulkner was subsequently appointed to the Council of State by President Patrick Hillery in 1984.

Following the election of a new Ceann Comhairle immediately after the 1981 general election, he retired to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the 1987 general election. In a Dáil career that spanned thirty years, his most notable achievements include the introduction of the legislation to establish two commercial semi-State companies, An Post and Telecom Éireann. He also played a notable role in the establishment of the Regional College of Technology in Dundalk now Dundalk Institute of Technology and the Faulkner Building is named after him as a result. Faulkner, while Minister for Transport &amp; Power, also oversaw part of the introduction of the Dublin Area Rapid Transport|DART network.

He died at the age of 94, on 1 June 2012 in Dunleer.

<text>Paisa (also transliterated as &quot;pice&quot;, &quot;pesa&quot;, &quot;poysha&quot;, &quot;poisha&quot; and &quot;baisa&quot;) is a monetary unit in several countries. The word is also a generalised idiom for money and wealth. In India, Nepal, and Pakistan, the &quot;paisa&quot; currently equals of a rupee. In Bangladesh, the &quot;poysha&quot; equals of a Bangladeshi taka. In Oman, the &quot;baisa&quot; equals of an Omani rial.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;paisa&quot; is from the Sanskrit term &quot;padāṁśa&quot; (, basic unit), meaning &#x27;quarter part base&#x27;, from &quot;pada&quot; () &quot;foot or quarter or base&quot; and &quot;aṁśa&quot; () &quot;part or unit&quot;. The pesa was also in use in colonial Kenya. The colloquial term for money in Burmese, &quot;paiksan&quot; (), is derived from the Hindi term &quot;paisa&quot; ().
==History==

Chaulukya coins were often called &quot;Gadhaiya Paise&quot; (9th–10th century CE). Until the 1950s in India and Pakistan (and before 1947 in British India), the paisa (back then spelled as &quot;pice&quot; in English) was equivalent to 3 pies, of an anna, or of a rupee. After the transition from a non-decimal currency to a decimal currency, the paisa equaled of a rupee and was known as a &quot;naya paisa&quot; (&quot;new paisa&quot;) for a few years to distinguish it from the old paisa(pice) that was of a rupee.

==Terminology==

In Hindi, Bengali, Afghan Persian, Urdu, Nepali and other languages, the word paisa often means money or cash. Medieval trade routes that spanned the Arabian Sea between India, the Arab regions and East Africa spread the usage of Indian subcontinent and Arabic currency terms across these areas. The word &quot;pesa&quot; as a reference to money in East African languages such as Swahili dates from that period. An example of this usage is the older day Kenyan mobile-phone-based money transfer service M-Pesa (which stands for &quot;mobile pesa&quot; or &quot;mobile money&quot;).

==Usage==
* Poysha = of a Bangladeshi taka (no longer in circulation)
* Paisa = of an Indian rupee (only 50 paisa coins are de facto valid but no longer in circulation)
* Paisa = of a Nepalese rupee (no longer in circulation)
* Baisa = of an Omani rial
* Paisa = of a Pakistani rupee (Officially demonetized from 1 October 2014)

<text>William Pitt Fessenden (October 16, 1806September 8, 1869) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Maine. Fessenden was a Whig (later a Republican) and member of the Fessenden political family. He served in the United States House of Representatives and Senate before becoming Secretary of the Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. Fessenden then re-entered the Senate, where he died in office in 1869.

A lawyer, he was a leading antislavery Whig in Maine; in Congress, he fought the Slave Power, plantation owners who controlled Southern states. He built an antislavery coalition in the state legislature that elected him to the U.S. Senate; it became Maine&#x27;s Republican organization. In the Senate, Fessenden played a central role in the debates on Kansas, denouncing the expansion of slavery. He led Radical Republicans in attacking Democrats Stephen Douglas, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan. Fessenden&#x27;s speeches were read widely, influencing Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln and building support for Lincoln&#x27;s 1860 Republican presidential nomination. During the war, Senator Fessenden helped shape the Union&#x27;s taxation and financial policies. He abandoned his earlier radicalism, joining pro-Lincoln Moderate Republicans against the Radicals and becoming Lincoln&#x27;s Treasury Secretary.

After the war, Fessenden was back in the Senate, as chair of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which established terms for resuming congressional representation for the southern states, and which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Later, during the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Fessenden provided critical support that prevented the Senate conviction of President Johnson, who had been impeached by the House. He was the first Republican senator to ring out &quot;...&quot;not guilty&quot;&quot; followed by six other Republican senators, ultimately resulting in the acquittal of President Johnson. Fessenden&#x27;s vote against convicting Johnson were motivated by his support for free trade and fears of a Benjamin Wade presidency.

He is the only person to have three streets in Portland named for him: William, Pitt and Fessenden streets in the city&#x27;s Oakdale neighborhood.

==Youth and early career==
Fessenden was born in Boscawen, New Hampshire on October 16, 1806. His father was attorney and legislator Samuel Fessenden. His mother was Ruth Greene. The parents were unmarried. William was separated from his mother at his birth, and he raised by his paternal grandmother for seven years.

He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1823 and then studied law. He was a founding member of the Maine Temperance Society in 1827. That year he was admitted to the bar, and practiced with his father, who was also a prominent anti-slavery activist. He practiced law first in Bridgton, Maine, a year in Bangor, and afterward in Portland.

He was a member of the Maine House of Representatives in 1832 and was its leading debater. He refused nominations to Congress in 1831 and in 1838, and served in the Maine legislature again in 1840, becoming chairman of the house committee to revise the statutes of the state.

He was elected for one term in the United States House of Representatives as a Whig in 1840. During this term, he moved to repeal the rule that excluded anti-slavery petitions and spoke upon the loan and bankrupt bills, and the army. At the end of his term in Congress, he turned his attention wholly to his law business until he was again in the Maine legislature in 1845–46. He acquired a national reputation as a lawyer and an anti-slavery Whig, and in 1849 prosecuted before the United States Supreme Court an appeal from an adverse decision of Judge Joseph Story, and gained a reversal by an argument which Daniel Webster pronounced the best he had heard in twenty years. He was again in the Maine legislature in 1853 and 1854.

==Service in U.S. Senate and Cabinet==

Fessenden&#x27;s strong anti-slavery principles caused his election to the U.S. Senate in 1854, with the support of Whigs and Anti-Slavery Democrats.

Upon taking office, he immediately began speaking against the Kansas–Nebraska Act. His speech on the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, in 1856, received the highest praise, and in 1858 his speech on the Lecompton Constitution of Kansas, and his criticisms of the opinion of the supreme court in the Dred Scott case, were considered the ablest discussion of those topics. He participated in the organization of the Republican Party, being re-elected to the Senate from that group in 1860, this time without the formality of a nomination.

In 1861, he was a member of the Peace Congress, but when hostilities started he insisted that the war should be prosecuted vigorously. By the secession of the Southern senators, the Republicans acquired control of the senate and placed Fessenden at the head of the finance committee. During the Civil War, he was the most conspicuous senator in sustaining the national credit. He opposed the Legal Tender Act as unnecessary and unjust. As chairman of the finance committee, Fessenden prepared and carried through the senate all measures relating to revenue, taxation, and appropriations, and, as declared by Charles Sumner, was &quot;in the financial field all that our best generals were in arms.&quot;

President Abraham Lincoln appointed Fessenden United States Secretary of the Treasury upon Salmon P. Chase&#x27;s resignation. It was described as the darkest hour of national finances in the United States. Chase had just withdrawn a loan from the market for want of acceptable bids, and the capacity of the country to lend seemed exhausted. The currency had been enormously inflated: the paper dollar was worth only 34 cents; gold was at $280/ounce. Fessenden at first refused the office, but at last, accepted in obedience to the universal public pressure. When his acceptance became known, gold fell to $225/ounce. He declared that no more currency should be issued, and, making an appeal to the people, he prepared and put upon the market the seven-thirty loan, which proved a triumphant success, and raised $400,000,000. This loan was in the form of bonds bearing interest at the rate of 7.30%, which were issued in denominations as low as $50 so that people of moderate means could take them. He also framed and recommended the measures, adopted by congress, which permitted the subsequent consolidation and funding of the government loans into the 4% and 4.5% bonds.

Fessenden began his service as Secretary of the Treasury on July 5, 1864. The financial situation becoming favorable on the raising of another large loan, in accordance with his expressed intention, he resigned the secretaryship, leaving on March 3, 1865, to return to the Senate, to which he had now for the third time been elected, and where he would serve for the rest of his life.

From 1865 to 1867, he headed the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which was responsible for overseeing the readmission of states from the former Confederacy into the Union. He wrote its report, which vindicated the power of Congress over the rebellious states, showed their relations to the government under the constitution and the law of nations, and recommended the constitutional safeguards made necessary by the rebellion. At this point, Fessenden was the acknowledged leader in the Senate among Republicans and was considered a moderate rather than Radical Republican. Radical leader Charles Sumner, deemed &quot;too ultra,&quot; was snubbed entirely from the committee.

During President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial in 1868, Fessenden broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators, and voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. He, Joseph S. Fowler, James W. Grimes, John B. Henderson, Lyman Trumbull, Peter G. Van Winkle, and Edmund G. Ross defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction. They were joined by three other Republican senators (James Dixon, James Rood Doolittle, Daniel Sheldon Norton) and all nine Democrats in voting against conviction. As a result, a 35–19 vote in favor of removing the President from office failed by a single vote of reaching a 2/3 majority. After the trial, Congressman Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. In Butler&#x27;s hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards. This included Kansas senator Edmund G. Ross, who was actively embroiled in patronage corruption.

He served as chairman of the Finance Committee during the 37th through 39th Congresses (from 1861 to 1867), which led to his Cabinet appointment. He also served as a chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds during the 40th Congress, the Appropriations Committee during the 41st Congress and the U.S. Senate Committee on the Library, also during the 41st Congress. In 1867, he was one of two senators (the other was Senator Justin S. Morrill of Vermont) who voted against the purchase of Alaska from Russia. His last speech in the Senate was upon the bill to strengthen the public credit. He advocated the payment of the principal of the public debt in gold and opposed the notion that it might lawfully be paid in depreciated greenbacks.

In 1867, Radical Republican senator Charles Sumner introduced legislation that would expand Reconstruction efforts that included the provision of homesteads to freedmen. Fessenden lamented in opposition: &quot;That is more than we do for white men,&quot; to which Sumner retorted: &quot;White men have never been in slavery.&quot;

During the 1868 United States presidential election, Fessenden joined the other six pro-Johnson Republican senators in campaigning for Ulysses S. Grant, who defeated Democratic nominee Horatio Seymour.

For several years, he was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He received the degree of LL.D. from Bowdoin in 1858, and from Harvard University in 1864.

Fessenden died on September 8, 1869, while serving in the U.S. Senate. He was interred at the Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine. On December 14, 1869, George Henry Williams addressed the U.S. Senate to deliver a tribute to his friend and fellow Senator.

==Personal life==
Two of his brothers, Samuel Clement Fessenden and Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden, were also Congressmen.

Fessenden married Ellen M. Deering in 1832, and she died in 1857. They had three sons who served in the American Civil War: Samuel Fessenden, who was killed at the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Brigadier-General James Deering Fessenden, and the Major-General Francis Fessenden, the latter of whom wrote a two-volume biography of his father, &quot;The Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden,&quot; which was published in 1907. A fourth son, William Howard Fessenden, stayed in Maine to take care of the law practice his father had established. Their fifth child was Mary Elizabeth Deering Fessenden who died in childhood.

Actress Beverly Garland is his great-great-granddaughter who dropped her real name Fessenden and went by her married name Garland.

<text>Stone carving is an activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, stone work has survived which was created during our prehistory or past time.

Work carried out by paleolithic societies to create stone tools is more often referred to as knapping. Stone carving that is done to produce lettering is more often referred to as lettering. The process of removing stone from the earth is called mining or quarrying.

Stone carving is one of the processes which may be used by an artist when creating a sculpture. The term also refers to the activity of masons in dressing stone blocks for use in architecture, building or civil engineering. It is also a phrase used by archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists to describe the activity involved in making some types of petroglyphs.

==History==
The earliest known works of representational art are stone carvings. Often marks carved into rock or petroglyphs will survive where painted work will not. Prehistoric Venus figurines such as the Venus of Berekhat Ram may be as old as 250,000 years, and are carved in stones such as tuff and limestone.

These earliest examples of the stone carving are the result of hitting or scratching a softer stone with a harder one, although sometimes more resilient materials such as antlers are known to have been used for relatively soft stone. Another early technique was to use an abrasive that was rubbed on the stone to remove the unwanted area.
Prior to the discovery of steel by any culture, all stone carving was carried out by using an abrasion technique, following rough hewing of the stone block using hammers. The reason for this is that bronze, the hardest available metal until steel, is not hard enough to work any but the softest stone. The Ancient Greeks used the ductility of bronze to trap small granules of carborundum, that are naturally occurring on the island of Milos, thus making a very efficient file for abrading the stone.

The development of iron made possible stone carving tools, such as chisels, drills and saws made from steel, that were capable of being hardened and tempered to a state hard enough to cut stone without deforming, while not being so brittle as to shatter. Carving tools have changed little since then.

Modern, industrial, large quantity techniques still rely heavily on abrasion to cut and remove stone, although at a significantly faster rate with processes such as water erosion and diamond saw cutting.

One modern stone carving technique uses a new process: The technique of applying sudden high temperature to the surface. The expansion of the top surface due to the sudden increase in temperature causes it to break away. On a small scale, Oxy-acetylene torches are used. On an industrial scale, lasers are used. On a massive scale, carvings such as the Crazy Horse Memorial carved from the Harney Peak granite of Mount Rushmore and the Confederate Memorial Park in Albany, Georgia are produced using jet heat torches.

==Stone sculpture==


Carving stone into sculpture is an activity older than civilization itself. Prehistoric sculptures were usually human forms, such as the Venus of Willendorf and the faceless statues of the Cycladic cultures. Later cultures devised animal, human-animal and abstract forms in stone. The earliest cultures used abrasive techniques, and modern technology employs pneumatic hammers and other devices. But for most of human history, sculptors used hammer and chisel as the basic tools for carving stone.

The process begins with the selection of a stone for carving. Some artists use the stone itself as inspiration; the Renaissance artist Michelangelo claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block. Other artists begin with a form already in mind and find a stone to complement their vision. The sculptor may begin by forming a model in clay or wax, sketching the form of the statue on paper or drawing a general outline of the statue on the stone itself.

When ready to carve, the artist usually begins by knocking off large portions of unwanted stone. This is the &quot;roughing out&quot; stage of the sculpting process. For this task they may select a point chisel, which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage; which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks. Those two chisels are used in combination with a masons driving hammer.

Once the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed, and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process, usually in combination with a wooden mallet.

Eventually the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called rasps and rifflers are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair.

The final stage of the carving process is polishing. Sandpaper can be used as a first step in the polishing process, or sand cloth. Emery, a stone that is harder and rougher than the sculpture media, is also used in the finishing process. This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the color of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen. Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior.

Sculptures can be carved via either the direct or the indirect carving method. Indirect carving is a way of carving by using an accurate clay, wax or plaster model, which is then copied with the use of a compass or &quot;proportional dividers&quot; or a pointing machine. The direct carving method is a way of carving in a more intuitive way, without first making an elaborate model. Sometimes a sketch on paper or a rough clay draft is made.

==Stone carving considerations==
Stone has been used for carving since ancient times for many reasons. Most types of stone are easier to find than metal ores, which have to be mined and smelted. Stone can be dug from the surface and carved with hand tools. Stone is more durable than wood, and carvings in stone last much longer than wooden artifacts. Stone comes in many varieties and artists have abundant choices in color, quality and relative hardness.

Soft stone such as chalk, soapstone, pumice and Tufa can be easily carved with found items such as harder stone or in the case of chalk even the fingernail.
Limestones and marbles can be worked using abrasives and simple iron tools.
Granite, basalt and some metamorphic stone is difficult to carve even with iron or steel tools; usually tungsten carbide tipped tools are used, although abrasives still work well. Modern techniques often use abrasives attached to machine tools to cut the stone.

Precious and semi-precious gemstones are also carved into delicate shapes for jewellery or larger items, and polished; this is sometimes referred to as lapidary, although strictly speaking lapidary refers to cutting and polishing alone.

When worked, some stones release dust that can damage lungs (silica crystals are usually to blame), so a respirator is sometimes needed.

==Stone shaping and tools==
Basic stone carving tools fall into five categories:

* Percussion tools for hitting - such as mallets, axes, adzes, bouchards and toothed hammers.
* Tools for rough shaping of stone, to form a block the size needed for the carving. These include feathers and wedges and pitching tools. 
* Chisels for cutting - such as lettering chisels, points, pitching tools, and claw chisels. Chisels, in turn, may be handheld and hammered or pneumatic powered.
* Diamond tools which include burrs, cup wheels, and blades mounted on a host of power tools. These are used sometimes through the entire carving process from rough work to the final finish.
* Abrasives for material removals - such as carborundum blocks, drills, saws, grinding and cutting wheels, water-abrasive machinery and dressing tools such as French and English drags.

More advanced processes, such as laser cutting and jet torches, use sudden high temperature with a combination of cooling water to spall flakes of stone. Other modern processes may involve diamond-wire machines or other large scale production equipment to remove large sections of undesired stone.

The use of chisels for stone carving is possible in several ways. Two are:

*The mason&#x27;s stroke, in which a flat chisel is used at approximately 90 degrees to the surface in an organized sweep. It shatters the stone beneath it and each successive pass lowers the surface.
*The lettering stroke, in which the chisel is used along the surface at approximately 30 degrees to cut beneath the existing surface.

There are many types and styles of stone carving tools, each carver will decide for themselves which tools to use. Traditionalists might use hand tools only. 
* Lettering chisels for incising small strokes create the details of letters in larger applications.
* Fishtail carving chisels are used to create pockets, valleys and for intricate carving, whilst providing good visibility around the stone.
* Masonry chisels are used for the general shaping of stones.
* Stone point tools are used to rough out the surface of the stone.
* Stone claw tools are used to remove the peaks and troughs left from the previously used tools.
* Stone pitching tools are used to remove large quantities of stone.
* Stone nickers are used to split stones by tracing a line along the stone with progressive strikes until the stone breaks along the line.

Powered pneumatic hammers make the hard work easier. Progress on shaping stone is faster with pneumatic carving tools. Air hammers (such as Cuturi) place many thousands of impacts per minute upon the end of the tool, which would usually be manufactured or modified to suit the purpose. This type of tool creates the ability to &#x27;shave&#x27; the stone, providing a smooth and consistent stroke, allowing for larger surfaces to be worked.

Among modern tool types, there are two main stone carving chisels:
* Heat treated high carbon steel tools - Generally forged
* Tungsten carbide tipped tools - Generally forged, slotted, and carbide inserts brazed in to provide a harder and longer-wearing cutting edge.

<text>The Light Crust Doughboys is an American Western swing band from Texas, United States, organized in 1931 by the Burrus Mill and Elevator Company in Saginaw, Texas. The band achieved its peak popularity in the few years leading up to World War II. In addition to launching Western swing pioneers Bob Wills and Milton Brown, it provided a platform for many of the best musicians of the genre, including Tommy Duncan, Cecil Brower, John Parker and Kenneth Pitts.

The original group disbanded in 1942, although band member Marvin Montgomery led a new version organized in the 1960s. A contemporary incarnation beginning in the 1990s (including Montgomery until his death in 2001) bills itself as the longest-running country music band in the world.

The Light Crust Doughboys were charter inductees into the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame in 1989, and were also inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In December 2005, the Light Crust Doughboys Hall of Fame and Museum opened in Quitman, Texas. The Light Crust Doughboys Museum was later moved in 2015 to the Auvenshine Library at Hill College in Hillsboro, Texas.

==History==
===Original group===

In 1931, Burrus Mill&#x27;s president, W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, wanted to link radio and advertising to promote the company&#x27;s Light Crust Flour. O&#x27;Daniel, who would later travel with the band and use its popularity as a springboard for his political ambitions, said the idea to start the band and link radio to advertising was pitched to him originally by Bob Wills, Herman Arnspiger and Milton Brown, who at the time were out-of-work musicians. There is disagreement about exactly when and on what radio station the Doughboys first broadcast, but it is generally accepted that by January 1931 the band had started playing on KFJZ-AM in Fort Worth. Their first broadcasts on the station included a sad prison song, &quot;Twenty-One Years&quot;, and a popular fiddle song, &quot;Chicken Reel&quot;. Their radio signature was their introduction by announcer-engineer Truett Kimzey: &quot;The Light Crust Doughboys are on the air.&quot;
Though the Doughboys&#x27; early broadcasts were well-received, the notion of using radio to advertise was still new, and O&#x27;Daniel was unconvinced. He also reportedly did not like the band&#x27;s &quot;hillbilly music,&quot; and canceled them at least once (though he almost immediately reinstated them). At first, he paid the band members $7.50 a week, but also required that they work a &quot;regular&quot; job at the mill: Wills drove a truck, Arnspiger worked on the dock loading flour, and Brown was a salesman. After a few weeks of brutally long days, the band members were allowed to stop working their &quot;regular&quot; jobs, but O&#x27;Daniel required them to be at the mill in their new practice room working on music eight hours each day. The band eventually won O&#x27;Daniel over by asking him to serve as their emcee during a broadcast.

The Doughboys began to hit their stride in March 1931, when they chartered a bus to Galveston, Texas to perform at a bakers convention. The band had the bus wired for sound and they played impromptu gigs at stops along the way to large crowds. Impressed, O&#x27;Daniel purchased a seven-seater Packard and rigged it with placards imploring people to eat more bread. In 1933, during a goodwill tour for the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, Truett Kimzey, the radio station&#x27;s sound engineer, who usually accompanied the band as its &quot;master of ceremonies,&quot; could not get away from the station. O&#x27;Daniel replaced him, to great effect — O&#x27;Daniel was a natural at showmanship and promotion, and the crowds loved him. Wills and Tommy Duncan departed in 1933; and by 1935, O&#x27;Daniel had left Burrus Mill to start his own flour company with a new radio band, Pat O&#x27;Daniel and His Hillbilly Boys. He was elected Texas governor in 1939.

Their popularity led to a short-lived film career, when they appeared alongside Gene Autry in the 1936 film, &quot;Oh, Susanna!&quot;. 

The original Doughboys group disbanded in 1942 with U.S involvement in World War II, and its final recording was released in 1948.

===Interim years===
During the following decades, leader Smokey Montgomery kept the band going in some form. In 1969, the Doughboys began recording again; and in 1973, the band took part in the last recording session for Wills in Dallas for the album, &quot;For the Last Time&quot;. In 1977, Texas State Resolution No. 463 recognised the Doughboys for their contributions to Texas history and Texas music. 

===Current group===
In 1983, musician and producer Art Greenhaw booked the Doughboys to play at the Mesquite Folk Festival, which Greenhaw had founded. He became excited about the prospects for reviving the band, which had been working only sporadically for several years. In 1993, Greenhaw joined the group as bassist; and as co-producer, he added horns to its sound, bringing about a new type of &quot;country jazz&quot; influenced by the old swing sound. Other members included Jerry Elliott (since 1960), Bill Simmons, John Walden, Jim Baker (since 1993) and Dale Cook. In 1995, the Texas Legislature declared the Doughboys the &quot;official music ambassadors of the Lone Star State&quot;; and they continue to perform today. 

The band&#x27;s collaborations with gospel singer James Blackwood earned Grammy nominations in 1998, 1999 and 2001; and in 2005, &quot;Southern Meets Soul: An American Gospel Jubilee&quot;, earned a Grammy nomination for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Album.

Their 2005 album, &quot;20th Century Gospel : From Hymns to Blackwood Brothers Tribute to Christian Country&quot;, included contributions from Greenhaw, the Jordanaires, and Nokie Edwards. AllMusic commented that it was &quot;A pristinely recorded and expertly played slice of truly American music, 20th Century Gospel is an uplifting work that resonates with the participants&#x27; obvious love of making music.&quot;

In 2006, in conjunction with the Diamond Anniversary of the Light Crust Doughboys, ASC (America Sejung Corporation) were commissioned to produce a limited edition series of seven fretted musical instruments. In collaboration with Art Greenhaw as technical advisor, these included a banjo, mandolin (with pickup), electric bass, and both hollow and solid-body electric guitars. The models were produced in a customised &quot;Biscuit Brown&quot;, with its burst-edge fade resembling an oven-baked biscuit in color.

In 2014, the Doughboys collaborated with Grant Maloy Smith on an album called &quot;Roots Gospel Round the USA: From Texas to New York.&quot; Smith sang lead vocal on several songs, and also contributed a song of his own, &quot;Where Main Street Ends.&quot;

In October 2019, the Doughboys announced plans for a worldwide tour to celebrate their forthcoming milestone. The 90th Anniversary Light Crust Doughboys Big Show Band &amp; Review was launched, in conjunction with a four set CD and double DVD issue.

<text>The Joint Committee on the Library is a Joint Committee of the United States Congress devoted to the affairs and administration of the Library of Congress, which is the library of the federal legislature. There are five members of each house on the committee. It has no subcommittees.

The committee was originally established in 1806 (&quot;House Journal&quot;. 1806. 9th Cong., 1st sess., 27 February.) to support the expansion of a congressional library. In 1811, the committee was officially made permanent. It is Congress&#x27;s oldest continuing joint committee.

The Committee currently has oversight of the operations of the Library of Congress, as well as management of the congressional art collection, the National Statuary Hall Collection, and the United States Botanic Garden, but does not have legislative authority.

The committee is authorized to accept any work of the fine arts on behalf of Congress and designate a location in the United States Capitol for the work of art (pursuant to the Revised Statutes). This authority was expanded in 1875 to require that artwork that was not the property of the United States could not be displayed in the Capitol and that rooms in the Capitol cannot be used as private studios for works of art without written permission of the Committee. The Architect of the Capitol has the authority to enforce this provision.

On February 24, 1933, with the passage of House Concurrent Resolution No. 47, the Architect of the Capitol was authorized and directed to relocate within the Capitol any of the statues already received and placed in Statuary Hall, upon the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library, and to provide for the reception and location of statues received from the states. This provision was permanently enacted into law in 2000 in the legislative branch appropriations.

Membership consists of the chairman and four Members of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, chairman and three Members of the Committee on House Administration and chairman (or his designee) of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch. The chairmanship of the Committee alternates between the House and Senate every two years, at the start of a new Congress.

<text>Frank Brenner Morrison (May 20, 1905 – April 19, 2004) was an American politician and attorney who served as the 31st governor of Nebraska from 1961 to 1967, representing the Democratic Party.

== Early life and education ==
Morrison was born in Golden, Colorado, and attended high school in Manhattan, Kansas. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1927, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Accepting an invitation from an aunt, he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and attended the University of Nebraska College of Law and earned a law degree in 1931.

== Career ==
Morrison began his career as a teacher, and was superintendent of schools in Farwell, Nebraska before establishing his legal practice in Stockville, Nebraska. He was elected Frontier County attorney in 1934.

Morrison was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, and chair of the Frontier County Democratic Party the same year.

He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1948 and 1954, Nebraska lieutenant governor in 1956, and United States Senate three times in 1958, 1966 and 1970, but lost all six elections. He was defeated for the US Senate by Roman L. Hruska in 1958 and 1970 and Carl T. Curtis in 1966.

Morrison secured the Democratic nomination for Governor of Nebraska and won the general election in 1960. He won reelection in 1962 and also in 1964. During his governorship, he worked to improve the University, particularly the scientific research and the agricultural departments, a state employees&#x27; retirement plan was initiated, a state income tax was sanctioned, and the state&#x27;s accounting system was restructured. He signed legislation for Educational Television which led to the establishment of the statewide public television network, an act he said was his most important.

After leaving office, Morrison was appointed in 1968 as food consultant for the U.S. Agency for International Development in India. From 1971 to 1974 he was the Douglas County public defender.

Morrison was the driving force behind the construction of the Great Platte River Road Archway Monument in Kearney, Nebraska. A bust of his face can be seen at the entrance to the monument. The Great Platte River Road Archway Monument gained fame by being featured in the movie &quot;About Schmidt&quot; with Jack Nicholson. On July 16, 2000, he dedicated the 50,000 square-foot building that arches over Interstate 80.

Morrison wrote an autobiography, &quot;My Journey Through the Twentieth Century&quot; in 2001. He was a confidant of both Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, and was summoned to the White House immediately after JFK was assassinated.

==Personal life==
He married Maxine Elizabeth Hepp in 1936 and they had three children, Frank Jr, David Jon, and Jean Marie.

Morrison died in 2004 of cancer in the McCook Community Hospital, McCook, Nebraska, one month short of his 99th birthday. He was cremated.

His son, Frank B. Morrison Jr. (1937–2006) was a justice of the Montana Supreme Court. His grandson, John Morrison, is a former State Auditor of Montana and was a 2006 Senate candidate.

<text>Samuel Fessenden (July 16, 1784 – March 13, 1869) was an American attorney, abolitionist, and politician. He served in both houses of the Massachusetts state legislature before Maine became a separate state. He was elected as major general in the state militia. He was considered a leader among his professional peers.

==Biography==
Fessenden was born on July 16, 1784, in what now is Fryeburg, Maine (until 1820, Maine was part of Massachusetts). His father was the Rev. William Fessenden, who graduated from Harvard College in 1768 and became the first minister of Fryeburg and was active politically, being elected more than once to the Massachusetts state legislature. His father also served as judge of probate.

Fessenden received his early education at Fryeburg Academy in his hometown. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1806. He then studied law (&quot;read the law&quot;) with Judge Dana, of Fryeburg, and Daniel Webster. He was admitted to the bar in 1809.

==Career==
Fessenden began his law practice at New Gloucester (then part of the state of Massachusetts). He became active in local politics.

In 1815-16, Fessenden was elected and served a term as a representative in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He then was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate, serving 1818-19. Fessenden also joined the state militia. After leaving the senate, he was elected as major-general of the 12th division of the Massachusetts (later Maine) militia. Maine was separated from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitted to the Union as a separate state as part of the contentious Missouri Compromise.

In 1822, Fessenden moved with his family to Portland, Maine, which offered more opportunities. About 1828, he declined the presidency of Dartmouth College.

Fessenden was an ardent Federalist and one of the early members of the anti-slavery party in Maine. In 1847 and 1848, he was a Liberty Party candidate for United States Congress and governor of Maine. He was an early supporter of the emerging United States Republican Party.

For forty years Fessenden was considered the leader of the bar to which he belonged. He was an active philanthropist. He published two orations and a treatise on the institution, duties, and importance of juries. In 1846, he was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. by Bowdoin College.

==Family==
Three of his sons followed Samuel Fessenden into politics: William Pitt Fessenden, who became U. S. Treasury Secretary, and two who were elected as U. S. congressmen, Samuel C. Fessenden, and T. A. D. Fessenden.

His son, William Pitt Fessenden, was born on October 16, 1806, to Ruth Greene, who was not married to Samuel (who was a student at the time). William Pitt was raised by his paternal grandparents for seven years.

Samuel Fessenden married Deborah Chandler in 1813, and they had several children. The family tree displayed below only shows the offspring of William Pitt Fessenden, however. Two of his grandsons through William became generals in the Union Army during the American Civil War: Francis Fessenden and James D. Fessenden. A third grandson, Samuel Fessenden (January 6, 1841 Portland, Maine - September 1, 1862 Centreville, Virginia), was mortally wounded at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He had been graduated from Bowdoin College in 1861. He also began to study law, but soon entered the military service as second lieutenant in the Second Maine Battery, November 30, 1861. He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 3, 1862, and became aide to Gen. Zebulon B. Tower in July 1862.

He died in Portland on March 13, 1869.

Samuel Fessenden&#x27;s cousin, Thomas Green Fessenden, became a noted author and editor.

<text>Hedi Lang (30 October 1931 – 31 March 2004) was a Swiss politician. She was one of the first women to be elected to the Swiss National Council, the first woman elected to a cantonal executive and the second woman to serve as President of the National Council. She was a member of the Social Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Hedi Lang was born on 30 October 1931 in Uster to Johann Gehri, a cheesemaker from Seedorf, Bern. She married Ernst Lang in 1957 and apprenticed at banks for several years before joining the staff of &quot;Die Arbeit&quot;, the socialist newspaper where her husband was the editor. In 1961, she joined the Social Democratic Party and in 1970, she was elected to the council of Wetzikon, where she and Ernst moved after their marriage. 

In the 1971 Swiss federal election, women were permitted to vote in federal elections for the first time. Lang was elected to the National Council as one of 10 women that year, the first to serve in the Federal Assembly. She rose to become the president of the parliamentary audit committee and, in 1981, became the President of the National Council, the second woman to hold the presidency after Elisabeth Blunschy in 1977. 

Lang left the National Council in 1983 and was elected to the Executive Council of Zürich and became the first woman to sit on a cantonal executive council. On the council, she was the Director of Justice and Home Affairs. In 1995, she left the council, having successfully shepherded the work on the expansion of Zurich Airport.

<text>Nancy Stark Smith (February 11, 1952 – May 1, 2020) was an American dancer and founding participant in contact improvisation.

==Early life and education==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 11, 1952, Stark Smith was the child of Dr. Joseph J. Smith, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and his wife Lucille (Stark) Smith. In 1954, her family moved to Great Neck, New York, and her mother died when she was five.

Initially she trained as an athlete and gymnast and had little interest in dance, “I’d see the dancers standing in front of a wall of mirrors looking at themselves and making little movements. I didn’t understand what was exciting about that.” Stark Smith’s interest in dance was sparked in her first year at Oberlin College, where she participated in a residence with the Twyla Tharp company. She was intrigued by Tharp’s movement practices and inspired to continue studying modern and post-modern dance. While in college she took a class with Steve Paxton, an American dancer and creator of contact improvisation (which was then a nascent dance form). Stark Smith was moved by this technique and expressed her desire to continue working with Paxton. However, at that time, Paxton only worked with male dancers.

She attended Oberlin College. It was at Oberlin in 1971 that she was discovered by the internationally famous dance choreographer, Twyla Tharp.

In 1972, she participated in a performance project led by Paxton in which they practiced various improvisation techniques, including rolling and falling, throwing and catching one another, identifying flows of energy in the body, and generally exploring contact in duets. The performances they showed at the John Weber Gallery in New York City were the first performances of contact improvisation. Paxton later praised Stark Smith&#x27;s dance abilities: “She was athletic, she was responsive, she would take initiative… she was very daring.”

After graduating from Oberlin College with a degree in dance and writing, Stark Smith participated in a Reunion Tour with Paxton and other dancers, and showed work at a venue known as the “Kitchen” in downtown Manhattan, which helped to grow the popularity of contact improvisation.

==Contact improvisation==

According to the International Encyclopedia of Dance, contact improvisation is “primarily a duet form (the most basic unit of social interaction) that emphasizes the qualities of mutual trust and interdependence by requiring ongoing contact between the two participants.” Stark Smith herself stated that having a partner is the key to contact improv, both to the form itself and to its growth through sharing the technique with others: we “create partners so we could continue to dance.” The form was largely popularized by Paxton, Stark Smith, and other early innovators, who disseminated it through teaching across the country. In reflecting on early performances of contact improvisation, Stark Smith recalled people were excited and surprised by its disregard for traditional gender roles employed in dance: women lifting men was radical in the early 1970s.

As contact improvisation gained a following, Paxton and others expressed concern for the safety of dancers learning the form without proper training. In 1975, Stark Smith founded &quot;Contact Newsletter&quot; (later &quot;Contact Quarterly),&quot; an international journal of dance and improvisation, which she continued to co-edit and produce with Lisa Nelson until her death. In the early years of contact improvisation, &quot;Contact Quarterly&quot; expressed Steve Paxton, Stark Smith&#x27;s, and other core members choice to make informal leadership and community groups the culture of contact improvisation. Eschewing a trademark and policing of teachers, they used &quot;Contact Quarterly&quot; to influence and create open communication among leaders, teachers, and contact dancers. Stark Smith maintained that there was no precise pedagogy for teaching the form, and this gave dancers the freedom to innovate. About learning improvisation, she stated, “Once you get a clear feel for the basic premise, develop a few safety skills, and get your reflexes primed and ready, then you&#x27;re off. You learn by doing.”

Throughout her life Stark Smith worked as a dancer, performer, instructor, author, and organizer. She travelled the world to teach and present performances of contact and improvised dance. She collaborated with numerous partners including Steve Paxton, Julyen Hamilton, Karen Nelson, and the musician and composer Mike Vargas, who later became her partner.

Beginning in 1990, Stark Smith developed the Underscore, a series of exercises leading to long-form contact improvisation jams, providing guidance in the development of the dance. It is an arc that enables dancers to establish the mind/body connection that most supports improvisation, explores various forms of connection, and concludes with reflection (&quot;harvesting&quot;). When introducing the Underscore, facilitators use Stark Smith&#x27;s &#x27;hieroglyph&#x27; movement drawings. Originally created by Stark Smith as spontaneous drawings, the shapes and lines of such &#x27;hieroglyphs&#x27; are intended to communicate the internal sensations of a moving body and elicit free interpretation by dancers. Dancers are encouraged to create their own &#x27;hieroglyph&#x27; drawings. Such translations from the experience of dance to the telling of it can be seen to illustrate her attempt to convey and include the subjectivities and fluidity in dance as creative practice. They are intended to trigger an esthetic response in others by inviting participants to embody them.

==Death==
She died from ovarian cancer in Florence, Massachusetts at the age of 68, on May 1, 2020.

<text>The Poynting–Robertson effect, also known as Poynting–Robertson drag, named after John Henry Poynting and Howard P. Robertson, is a process by which solar radiation causes a dust grain orbiting a star to lose angular momentum relative to its orbit around the star. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain&#x27;s motion.

This causes dust that is small enough to be affected by this drag, but too large to be blown away from the star by radiation pressure, to spiral slowly into the star. In the Solar System, this affects dust grains from about to in diameter. Larger dust is likely to collide with another object long before such drag can have an effect.

Poynting initially gave a description of the effect in 1903 based on the luminiferous aether theory, which was superseded by the theories of relativity in 1905–1915. In 1937 Robertson described the effect in terms of general relativity.

== History ==

Robertson considered dust motion in a beam of radiation emanating from a point source. A. W. Guess later considered the problem for a spherical source of radiation and found that for particles far from the source the resultant forces are in agreement with those concluded by Poynting.

== Cause ==

The effect can be understood in two ways, depending on the reference frame chosen.
From the perspective of the grain of dust circling a star (panel (a) of the figure), the star&#x27;s radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction (aberration of light). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. The angle of aberration is extremely small since the radiation is moving at the speed of light while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.

From the perspective of the star (panel (b) of the figure), the dust grain absorbs sunlight entirely in a radial direction, thus the grain&#x27;s angular momentum is not affected by it. But the re-emission of photons, which is isotropic in the frame of the grain (a), is no longer isotropic in the frame of the star (b). This anisotropic emission causes the photons to carry away angular momentum from the dust grain.

The Poynting–Robertson drag acts in the opposite direction to the dust grain&#x27;s orbital motion, leading to a drop in the grain&#x27;s angular momentum. While the dust grain thus spirals slowly into the star, its orbital speed increases continuously.

The Poynting–Robertson force is equal to
: formula_1
where &quot;v&quot; is the grain&#x27;s velocity, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;W&quot; is the power of the incoming radiation, &quot;r&quot; the grain&#x27;s radius, &quot;G&quot; is the universal gravitational constant, &quot;M&quot;☉ the Sun&#x27;s mass, &quot;L&quot;☉ is the solar luminosity, and &quot;R&quot; the grain&#x27;s orbital radius.

== Relation to other forces ==

The Poynting–Robertson effect is more pronounced for smaller objects. Gravitational force varies with mass, which is formula_2 (where formula_3 is the radius of the dust), while the power it receives and radiates varies with surface area (formula_4). So for large objects the effect is negligible.

The effect is also stronger closer to the Sun. Gravity varies as formula_5 (where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the orbit), whereas the Poynting–Robertson force varies as formula_6, so the effect also gets relatively stronger as the object approaches the Sun. This tends to reduce the eccentricity of the object&#x27;s orbit in addition to dragging it in.

In addition, as the size of the particle increases, the surface temperature is no longer approximately constant, and the radiation pressure is no longer isotropic in the particle&#x27;s reference frame. If the particle rotates slowly, the radiation pressure may contribute to the change in angular momentum, either positively or negatively.

Radiation pressure affects the effective force of gravity on the particle: it is felt more strongly by smaller particles, and blows very small particles away from the Sun. It is characterized by the dimensionless dust parameter formula_7, the ratio of the force due to radiation pressure to the force of gravity on the particle:
: formula_8
where formula_9 is the Mie scattering coefficient, formula_10 is the density, and formula_11 is the size (the radius) of the dust grain.

=== Impact of the effect on dust orbits ===

Particles with formula_12 have radiation pressure at least half as strong as gravity and will pass out of the Solar System on hyperbolic orbits if their initial velocities were Keplerian. 
For rocky dust particles, this corresponds to a diameter of less than 1 μm.

Particles with formula_13 may spiral inwards or outwards, depending on their size and initial velocity vector; they tend to stay in eccentric orbits.

Particles with formula_14 take around 10,000 years to spiral into the Sun from a circular orbit at 1 AU. In this regime, inspiraling time and particle diameter are both roughly formula_15.

If the initial grain velocity was not Keplerian, then circular or any confined orbit is possible for formula_16.

It has been theorized that the slowing down of the rotation of Sun&#x27;s outer layer may be caused by a similar effect.

<text>John Kay (born Joachim Fritz Krauledat; April 12, 1944) is an American rock singer, songwriter and guitarist known as the frontman of Steppenwolf.

== Early life ==
Kay was born on April 12, 1944 in Tilsit, East Prussia, Germany (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His father Fritz, born 1913 in Absteinen near Pogegen in the Memelland (today Opstainys in Pagėgiai Municipality, Lithuania), was killed a month before Kay was born.

In early 1945, Kay&#x27;s mother fled with him from the advancing Soviet troops during the evacuation of East Prussia in harsh winter conditions. Their train got stuck near Arnstadt, which was first occupied by the Americans, but then became part of the East German Soviet occupation zone. In 1949, they crossed the already-fortified border to resettle in Hanover, West Germany (as recounted in his song &quot;Renegade&quot; on the album &quot;Steppenwolf 7&quot;). Now living in the British occupation zone, the young Joachim, who had eye problems and could not speak or understand English, was first inspired by and learned about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music while listening to Little Richard on U.S. Armed Forces radio. When his family moved to Toronto in 1958, teachers had a hard time pronouncing his birth name, so he was called John K instead. Five years later, they moved to Buffalo, New York, and became American citizens.

== Career ==

In the early 1960s, Kay worked at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles without success. After hitchhiking to Canada in 1965, he was invited by fellow German-born bass player Nick St. Nicholas to join the blues-rock band the Sparrows. The band had moderate success in Canada before moving to California, augmenting its line-up, and changing its name to Steppenwolf in 1967. With music that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, Kay&#x27;s Steppenwolf had international success with songs such as &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;The Pusher&quot;, and &quot;Rock Me&quot;.

Kay recorded both as a solo artist and with Steppenwolf during the late 1970s, and wrapped up Steppenwolf&#x27;s 50th year of touring with what was to be a final gig in October 2018. Kay and Steppenwolf appeared on 24 July 2010 at the three-day HullabaLOU music festival in Louisville, Kentucky.

== Awards and recognition ==

Despite never holding Canadian citizenship, Kay was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in recognition of the beginning of his musical career in Toronto. He was also nominated as part of Steppenwolf for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016 for the induction year 2017. In 2018, Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; was one of the first five record singles to be inducted into The Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Kay is married to German-born Jutta Maue, whom he met in 1965 in Canada while she was working in a coffeehouse where Kay&#x27;s band, the Sparrows, were playing. They have one daughter, Shawn. The couple founded the Maue-Kay Foundation, which supports human rights and the protection of wildlife and the environment.

In 2016, Kay credited his relationship with Jutta as part of the inspiration for Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;.

As of 2005, Kay has residences in West Vancouver, British Columbia, and Nashville, Tennessee.

<text>Good News for People Who Love Bad News is the fourth studio album by American rock band Modest Mouse, released on April 6, 2004, by Epic Records. Founding member Jeremiah Green did not perform on this album due to his temporary absence from the band, and it would be the only release during his time with Modest Mouse that he would not appear on.

&quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2005. It was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA in March 2024, and had sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States by 2006. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Float On&quot;, &quot;Ocean Breathes Salty&quot;, and &quot;The World at Large&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; was released to widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album all five stars and said that &quot;Ultimately, what makes &quot;Good News&quot; so successful is that it retains the melancholy mood of past works, while at the same time adding depth and maturity.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave it an A and said it was &quot;Half expansive, burnished radio-rock, half swampy Delta hoodoo-hollerin&#x27; that reeks of Brock&#x27;s Southern sojourn.&quot; &quot;Filter&quot; gave it a score of 92% and said that it would soon be &quot;one of the best albums of 2004&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; gave it a score of nine out of ten and called it &quot;A real-life pop record. Well, not pop in the Girls Aloud sense of the word obviously, more in the drop-dead, fuzz-box brilliant &#x27;Here Comes Your Man&#x27; sense.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;a daring yet accessible disc&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;the best Modest Mouse album yet.&quot; E! Online gave it a B+ and said that &quot;If there&#x27;s a touchstone band for this album, it&#x27;s Little Creatures-era Talking Heads cranking out songs that are joyously eccentric, celebratory and catchy.&quot; Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and stated: &quot;It just feels that amidst his bare and heartfelt explorations of life and the old wooden box wherein we all end up, Brock has learned to dance, learned to allow himself a smile.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; gave the album four stars out of five and said that &quot;Moments of simple, exultant joy are plentiful.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; also gave it four stars out of five and said that the album consisted of &quot;45 bonkers minutes&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated, &quot;If &quot;Good News...&quot; isn&#x27;t the pillar-like masterpiece Modest Mouse fans have waited years for, it&#x27;s proof that things haven&#x27;t completely fallen apart.&quot; &quot;Dusted&quot; gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;a more varied album than &quot;The Moon and Antarctica&quot; (which did seem to have only one speed), and with the return of original member Dan Gallucci, Brock appears to have revived the heavy lead guitar playing of their early work.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also gave it a favorable review and stated, &quot;The songs still rely on Brock&#x27;s echoing guitar patterns and Mobius-strip lyrics, delivered in the voice of a harried, hip-hop-inflected square-dance caller, but though the vehicle stays the same, the scenery outside the window changes considerably.&quot;

Neumu.net gave it a score of seven out of ten and said, &quot;While the album is not as cohesive a vision, many of its songs are more focused.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, &quot;No bad news here, just more headline-making from an innovative, ever-maturing group of musicians.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it a score of seven out of ten and said that &quot;At these transcending moments, &#x27;Good News...&#x27; is elevated into excellence. But overall, there is too much Mouse that bores and not enough Mouse that roars.&quot; Almost Cool gave it a score of 6.75 out of ten and said that &quot;Probably the biggest complaint could be that the group has tightened up their sound even more on this release, leaving behind even more of the roughshod qualities that made their earlier discs blister with such energy.&quot;

Other reviews are very average or mixed: &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album three stars out of five and called it &quot;A useful addition to a genre that prizes brain over brawn.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; also gave it three stars out of five and said that &quot;[Brock is] adept at wringing out emotion while straddling sentimentality, but too often here, gauche studio affectations make his sap sound plain cheap.&quot; Nude as the News gave it a score of six out of ten and stated, &quot;A lot of major label-imposed ideas, like rhythm guitar and a heartbreakingly conventional new bass sound, combine to utterly ruin the record&#x27;s first half. If you can make it through to News&#x27; innards, however, an EP&#x27;s worth of something like better-recorded, more thought-out Lonesome Crowded West material awaits.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; gave the album a C and said of Modest Mouse, &quot;Gone is pretty much everything they’ve learned in the last eight years or so, ditching all the progress they’ve made in favor of just making another Modest Mouse record. The results, needless to say, are disappointing.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; gave it two stars out of five and said that &quot;There are some pleasantly elaborate, wayward songs here... Forays into funk and Tom Waits&#x27; scrapyard are cringe-inducing, though.&quot;

<doc id="615119" wikidata="Q5545377" url="?curid=615119" title="George Tutuska">
<text>George Tutuska (born February 27, 1965 in Buffalo, NY) is an American musician, best known as the former drummer of the alternative rock band Goo Goo Dolls. He grew up in South Buffalo with four sisters. He attended Medaille College in Buffalo, and was studying to become an English teacher. That was also where he met Robby Takac and formed the Sex Maggots (later named Goo Goo Dolls) with one of Takac’s friends, John Rzeznik. 

Along with being the drummer for the band for nearly 10 years, Tutuska was a primary lyricist for all five albums he contributed to. In this article, John Rzeznik explains that he wrote—or perhaps co-wrote the lyrics to “James Dean” and “Road To Salinas”, both of which are songs off the Goo Goo Dolls’ second record, “Jed” released in 1989. Also, according to these articles; Tutuska and Rzeznik wrote “You Know What I Mean” together. Off the same record, Hold Me Up, released in 1990, Tutuska penned “There You Are”, the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; first single, about his girlfriend, whom he had just broken up with at the time. 

Later on in his career with the Goo Goo Dolls, he wrote “Already There” with Robby for their fourth studio album “Superstar Car Wash” released in 1993. He also completely wrote the song “Stand Alone” which was only featured on the promotional version of the fifth studio album the Dolls released, A Boy Named Goo.

==Life and career==
Tutuska is from Buffalo, New York. He is of Irish and Hungarian descent, and he is married with two children.

===Goo Goo Dolls===

Tutuska played drums with the Goo Goo Dolls from 1985 to 1994.

====Departure====
Prior to Tutuska&#x27;s departure from the Goo Goo Dolls, there was a payment dispute between him and long-time friend and singer/guitarist John Rzeznik over Tutuska&#x27;s contribution to the writing of the &quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot; single &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot;. During the completion of &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;, Tutuska had told band management that he would not tour behind the album unless royalties were to be split evenly among the three members, a practice Tutuska said had been the band&#x27;s standard practice ever since the release of its self-titled debut in 1987. Tutuska has said that when he told Rzeznik he had not received royalties from &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot;, Rzeznik admitted that he had been receiving such royalties for two years.

Just before &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;&#x27;s release, Tutuska left the band and was replaced by Mike Malinin.

===Post-Goo Goo Dolls===
During the 2000s, Tutuska played drums for a local South Buffalo based Celtic Rock band named Jackdaw. The band broke up in 2009.

<doc id="615121" wikidata="Q822946" url="?curid=615121" title="The Dreamers (2003 film)">
<text>The Dreamers () is a 2003 erotic romantic drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci from a screenplay by Gilbert Adair, based on Adair&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Holy Innocents&quot;. An international co-production by companies from France, Italy and the United Kingdom, the film tells the story of an American university student in Paris who, after meeting a peculiar brother and sister who are fellow film enthusiasts, becomes entangled in an erotic triangle. It is set against the backdrop of the 1968 Paris student riots. The film makes several references to various movies of classical and French New Wave cinema, incorporating clips from films that are often imitated by the actors in particular scenes.

There are two versions: an uncut NC-17-rated version, and an R-rated version that is about three minutes shorter.

It was the first film appearance of Eva Green, and is considered her breakthrough role.

==Plot==
In 1968, Matthew is a shy American exchange student who has come to Paris for a year to study French. While at the Cinémathèque Française protesting the firing of its director, Henri Langlois, he meets free-spirited twins Théo and Isabelle, the children of a famous French poet and his English wife. The three bond over a shared love of film. After dinner with their parents, Théo and Isabelle invite Matthew to stay with them while their parents leave town for a month. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends.

Matthew becomes suspicious of Théo and Isabelle&#x27;s relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they have a liberal attitude towards nudity and sexuality. Matthew gradually accepts the twins&#x27; unusual relationship and comes to enjoy his time living with them. The three re-enact a memorable scene from &quot;Bande à part&quot; by &quot;breaking the world record for running through the Louvre&quot;, and Matthew and Théo engage in playful arguments about Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the subject of Maoism, which Théo fervently believes in.

After Théo loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a Marlene Dietrich poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is dared by Théo to take Isabelle&#x27;s virginity in front of him. As Matthew and Isabelle fall in love with each other, he asks her what she would do if her parents discovered the nature of her relationship with Théo; she replies that she would kill herself.

Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Théo. Matthew and Isabelle leave the apartment and go on a regular date, which she has never experienced before. Théo retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle. She distances herself from both Théo and Matthew, only to find them next to each other on Théo&#x27;s bed when an argument between the two turns erotic. She then surprises them with a makeshift bedsheet fort and the three fall asleep in each other&#x27;s arms.

The next morning, Théo and Isabelle&#x27;s parents arrive home and find the sleeping trio naked in bed together. They are startled by what they find, but let them be, departing after leaving a cheque. Isabelle wakes up and discovers the cheque, realising that their parents have found them out. Wordlessly, she attaches a hose to the gas outlet and lies back down with the still-asleep Théo and Matthew, attempting to commit murder–suicide. Shortly afterwards, however, they are awakened by a brick being hurled through the window; they discover hundreds of students rioting in the streets.

All three of them are overjoyed and proceed to join the protesters. Théo then joins a small team of protesters preparing Molotov cocktails. Matthew tries to stop Théo by kissing him and Isabelle, arguing against violence, but he is shunned by both siblings. As Matthew walks away through the chaos, Théo takes Isabelle&#x27;s hand and hurls a Molotov cocktail at a line of police. The police charge the crowd.

==Cast==

==Production==
The first draft of the screenplay was an adaptation by Gilbert Adair of his own novel, &quot;The Holy Innocents&quot; (1988), inspired by the novel &quot;Les Enfants terribles&quot; (1929) by Jean Cocteau and the eponymous film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1950. During pre-production, Bertolucci made changes to it: he &quot;peppered the narrative with clips from the films he loves&quot; and dropped homosexual content – including scenes from the novel that depict Matthew and Théo having sex – which he felt was &quot;just too much.&quot; After the film was released, he said that it was &quot;faithful to the spirit of the book but not the letter.&quot;

Eva Green told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role of Isabelle, concerned that the film – which features full frontal nudity and full rear nudity along with graphic sex scenes – would cause her career to &quot;have the same destiny as Maria Schneider.&quot; Jake Gyllenhaal screen tested for the role of Matthew alongside Green, but eventually withdrew himself from consideration due to concerns about the film&#x27;s nudity. Michael Pitt was cast instead.

When Green saw a rough cut of the film, she said she was &quot;quite shocked&quot; and had to look away during the sex scenes; she later told an interviewer that for her, &quot;it was as though I was wearing a costume while we were making the film. It was as if I had another story in my mind. So I was left speechless.&quot;

===Rating===
Fox Searchlight Pictures gave the uncut version a limited theatrical release in the United States in 2004; it played in 116 theaters at its peak. In the United States, the film was released theatrically with an NC-17 rating, whereas in Italy it was rated VM14. Even with its NC-17 rating, it grossed $2.5 million in its United States theatrical release.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Though lushly atmospheric, &quot;The Dreamers&quot; doesn&#x27;t engage or provoke as much as it should.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was &quot;disarmingly sweet and completely enchanting&quot; and described it as &quot;fus[ing] sexual discovery with political tumult by means of a heady, heedless romanticism that nearly obscures the film&#x27;s patient, skeptical intelligence.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; called it a &quot;heady blend of &quot;Last Tango&quot; and &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;, but one that combines the grubbily voyeuristic elements of each film rather than their relative strengths.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, his highest rating, describing the film as &quot;poignant&quot; and &quot;extraordinarily beautiful&quot;.

==Music and soundtrack== 
The music advisors were Julien Civange and Charles Henri de Pierrefeu. Janice Ginsberg is credited as music supervisor and Nick Laird-Clowes as music consultant. The soundtrack was released in February 2004; AllMusic gave it three out of five, noting that &quot;while its juxtapositions of French tradition and counterculture are jarring at times, &quot;Dreamers&quot; still does a worthy job of capturing the film&#x27;s personal and political revolutions through music.&quot;

# &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; – The Jimi Hendrix Experience
# &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (cover version) – Michael Pitt &amp; the Twins of Evil
# &quot;Quatre Cents Coups&quot; (from the score of &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;) – Jean Constantin

# &quot;Dark Star&quot; (special band edit) – Grateful Dead
# &quot;Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien&quot; – Edith Piaf

Though the music of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company was featured prominently in the film, none of the songs were included on the soundtrack. All of the songs used in the film were from the album &quot;Live at Winterland &#x27;68&quot;. Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot;, from the album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, is also used in the film but is not included on the soundtrack. The Doors song &quot;Maggie M&#x27;Gill&quot; can be heard in the movie, but is not included on the soundtrack either.

==Home media==
&quot;The Dreamers&quot; was released on DVD in 2004. It includes a BBC film directed by David M. Thompson, &quot;Bertolucci Makes The Dreamers&quot;, narrated by Zoë Wanamaker, and a documentary &quot;Outside the Window: Events in France, May 1968&quot; with contributions from Robin Blackburn, Adair, and Bertolucci. Bertolucci says that 1968 was about cinema, politics, music, journalism, sex and philosophy dreaming together.

<doc id="615122" wikidata="Q1399394" url="?curid=615122" title="Winton M. Blount">
<text>Winton Malcolm Blount, known as Red Blount (February 1, 1921 – October 24, 2002), was an American philanthropist and politician who served as the United States Postmaster General from January 22, 1969, to January 1, 1972. He founded and served as the chief executive officer of the large construction company, Blount International, based in Montgomery, Alabama.

Blount was the last Postmaster General when the position was within the presidential Cabinet.

==Background==
Born in Union Springs, Alabama, Blount served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, having trained as a B-29 pilot. However, the war ended before his training was completed. Blount&#x27;s first name was spelled with a &quot;y&quot; on his birth certificate, but he used Winton as an adult in his business dealings to avoid having to explain the unusual spelling.

In 1946, Blount and his brother William Houston Blount started a building contractor company, Blount Brothers. The company worked on such construction projects as the First Avenue Viaduct in Birmingham, the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, and Cape Canaveral&#x27;s Complex 39A which launched Apollo 11 in Florida.

In 1952, Blount was appointed the Alabama Chairman of Citizens for Eisenhower, then in 1960 Southeastern Campaign Chairman for Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential campaign against John F. Kennedy. In 1961, Blount was elected President of the Alabama Chamber of Commerce; in 1968, President of the United States Chamber of Commerce.

In 1964, Blount was appointed by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to the National Citizens Committee for Community Relations to advise the White House on the enforcement of the new Civil Rights Act of 1964 even though Blount had expressed doubts about the new law.

In 1969, Blount was appointed as the Postmaster General by U.S. President Richard Nixon, and he supervised the transition in 1971 of the U.S. Post Office Department from a Cabinet-level department of the U.S. government to a special independent executive agency. He was thus the last Cabinet-level Postmaster General, and he served as the first director of the new U.S. Postal Service. Blount&#x27;s assistant Postmaster General was James M. Henderson.

In 1971, Blount&#x27;s profile was depicted alongside that of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s on the face of a silver proof coin commemorating the inauguration of the new Postal Service. The commemorative coin was offered in a carrier with one stamp bearing a Philadelphia postmark from the old Post Office, and another from Washington D.C., placed by the new Postal Service.

==U.S. Senate campaign, 1972==

Blount faced in the general election the long-term incumbent Democrat, John Sparkman, who had been the 1952 Democratic candidate for vice president against Richard M. Nixon. From May 1972 to November 1972, future U.S. President George W. Bush transferred from the Texas Air National Guard to serve as the political director in Blount&#x27;s campaign.

The final results were Sparkman 654,491 (65.3 percent) to Blount&#x27;s 347,523 (34.7 percent). Blount carried only traditionally Republican Winston and Houston counties and lost his home county of Montgomery.

==Later years==
In 1973, Blount returned to Blount International, Inc., becoming its president once again in 1974. From 1981 to 1984 Blount, Inc., built the King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In 1980, Blount served as national chairman of John Connally&#x27;s unsuccessful primary campaign, with the nomination being won by Ronald W. Reagan of California.

In 1996, the Greenwich Publishing Group published his autobiography called &quot;Doing It My Way&quot;, which he had co-written with Richard Blodgett.

In 1999, Blount International, Inc., was sold to Lehman Brothers company for $1.35 billion.

Blount died in Highlands, North Carolina, at the age of eighty-one.

==Legacy==

Blount and his wife Carolyn, were philanthropists and notable patrons of the arts. Together they founded the Blount Cultural Park in Montgomery, which is home to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts and the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. The Blounts donated the land and a 100,000 square foot theater as the new home of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival in 1985. The cost was $21.5 million and at the time was the largest private donation to an American theater.

In 1980, Blount received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

The Winton M. Blount Elementary School in Montgomery County, completed in 2003, is named in his honor. Located on the city&#x27;s rapidly growing east side, it is one of the largest elementary schools in the region.

The Blount Undergraduate Initiative, a liberal arts honors program for Blount Scholars, was started at the University of Alabama. Blount Scholars reside in the Blount Living Learning Center on the campus.

The Winton M. Blount Center for Postal Studies and the Winton M. Blount Research Chair, both at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, were founded with an endowment from the Blount estate.

<doc id="615124" wikidata="Q854551" url="?curid=615124" title="Bérenger Saunière">
<text>François-Bérenger Saunière (11 April 1852 – 22 January 1917) was a French Catholic priest in the village of Rennes-le-Château, in the Aude region. He was a central figure in the conspiracy theories surrounding the village, which form the basis of several documentaries and books such as the 1982 &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln. Elements of these theories were later used by Dan Brown in his best-selling 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, in which the fictional character Jacques Saunière is named after the priest.

Saunière served in Rennes-le-Château from 1885 until he was transferred to another village in 1909 by his bishop. He declined this nomination and subsequently resigned. From 1909 until his death in 1917, he was a non-stipendiary Free Priest (an independent priest without a parish, who did not receive any salary from the church because of suspension), and who from 1910 celebrated Mass at an altar constructed in a special conservatory by his Villa Bethania. Saunière&#x27;s refusal to leave Rennes-le-Château to continue his priesthood in another parish incurred permanent suspension. The epitaph on Saunière&#x27;s original 1917 gravestone read &quot;priest of Rennes-le-Château 1885-1917&quot;.

==Early life==
François Bérenger Saunière was born on 11 April 1852 in Montazels, in the Arrondissement of Limoux of the Aude region. He was the eldest of seven children, having three brothers (Alfred, Martial, and Joseph) and three sisters (Mathilde, Adeline, and Marie-Louise). He was the son of Marguerite Hugues and Joseph Saunière (1823–1906), also called &quot;cubié&quot;, who was the mayor of Montazels (Aude), managed the local flour mill, and was the steward of Marquis de Cazermajou&#x27;s castle. Alfred became a priest; Joseph wanted to be a physician but died at 25. Saunière went to school at St. Louis in Limoux, entered the seminary in Carcassonne in 1874, and was ordained as a priest in June, 1879.

==Ministry==

From 16 July 1879 until 1882, Saunière was the vicar of Alet. From June 1882 to 1885, he was a priest in the deanery of the small village of Clat. He was a teacher in the seminary in Narbonne but, because he was undisciplined, on 1 June 1885 he was appointed to another small village of approximately 300 inhabitants, to Rennes-le-Château with its church dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene.

For preaching anti-republican sermons from his pulpit during the elections of October 1885, Saunière was suspended by the French Minister of Religion. Between 1 December 1885 and July 1886 he resumed lessons in the seminary of Narbonne. As the villagers wanted him back, the prefect of the Aude reinstated Saunière. Between 1890 and 1891 he also said Mass on Sundays in Antugnac. Marie Dénarnaud, his maidservant, moved into the Presbytery at Rennes-le-Château with her family in 1890.

Claims that Bérenger Saunière had an ambiguous relationship with his maidservant, Marie Dénarnaud, are without foundation. Saunière himself outlined the following principles for dealing with a maidservant:

Respect, but not familiarity. Not to permit her to talk about matters of his ministry. What you say to a servant should not be able to be said to other women. She must avoid excesses of language, and he must not trust in her age or her piety too easily. She is not to enter the bedroom when he is in bed, except in case of illnesses.

===Mission 1891===
An important part of Saunière&#x27;s ministry at Rennes-le-Château was the installation and Blessing of the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes on 21 June 1891, commemorating the First Holy Communion of 24 children of the parish and &quot;to bring to a close the spiritual exercises of the retreat that had been preached by the Reverend Father Ferrafiat, diocesan missionary, of the Family of Saint Vincent de Paul, residing at Notre Dame de Marseille&quot; (the church, based at Limoux, is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary).

A &#x27;Visigothic pillar&#x27; acted as a plinth for the statue bearing the inscriptions &quot;Mission 1891&quot; and &quot;Penitence! Penitence!&quot;. Its authenticity is the subject of much debate. Saunière claimed it was one of two pillars that supported the original church altar. A genuine Visigothic pillar resembling the one installed by Saunière is displayed in the museum of Narbonne. The pillar that originally supported the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes was transferred into the &quot;Saunière museum&quot; in 1993 because of erosion and decay and was replaced by a resin replica.

===Church renovations===
The presbytery was one of several building projects Saunière launched around the village. He renovated the interior and exterior of the local church, as recommended by the architect Guiraud Cals in his report dated 1853. A receipt dated 5 June 1887 shows the first renovations involved the re-flooring of the church. A new altar to the value of 700 francs was donated by a wealthy benefactress of monarchist persuasion, Mme Marie Cavailhé, in July 1887. New stained-glass windows were fitted that cost 1,350 francs, which Saunière settled in three installments – April 1897, April 1899, and January 1900.

In November 1896 Saunière commissioned the prestigious sculptor and painter Giscard of Toulouse (established in 1855) to decorate his church with new statues of the saints, Stations of the Cross, baptismal font with statues of John baptising Jesus (bearing &quot;Ecce Agnus Dei&quot;), a bas-relief of Jesus giving the Sermon on the Mount above the confessional, and a figure of a Devil supporting a holy water stoup surmounted by angels making the sign of the cross, bearing the inscriptions &quot;BS&quot; and &quot;Par Ce Signe Tu Le Vaincras&quot; (&quot;By this sign you will conquer him&quot;). All these items were chosen by Saunière from Giscard&#x27;s catalogue. Although the 1896 edition of Giscard&#x27;s catalogue has not survived, and later catalogues omit the statue of the Devil, its head bears a resemblance to the one found on the statue of the dragon being vanquished by Saint Michael that was also made by Giscard. The total sum involved was 2,500 francs, paid in annual instalments of 500 francs by Saunière beginning at the end of December 1897.

Following Sauniere&#x27;s renovations and redecoratations, the church was re-dedicated on the feast of Pentecost 1897 by his bishop, Monsignor Billard.

Saunière built a grand estate between the years 1898 and 1905 that also involved buying several plots of land. This included the Renaissance-style Villa Bethania, the Tour Magdala (that he used as his personal library) connected to an orangery by a belvedere with rooms underneath, a garden with a pool and a cage for monkeys – all in the name of his maidservant, Marie Dénarnaud.

==Ecclesiastical trials, punishment and suspension==
Saunière&#x27;s renovation of his church and ostentatious construction programmes in a small hilltop village could not go unnoticed, and this attracted hostile reactions, with various complaints passed on by various sources to the Bishopric of Carcassonne. The bishopric had warned Saunière about his selling of Masses, and had sent him two written warnings in May 1901. These written warnings were repeated in June 1903 and August 1904. In 1899, Saunière purchased a clergymen&#x27;s directory (&quot;Annuaire du clergé français&quot;) through which he contacted both priests and religious communities across France to solicit Mass requests.

Monsignor Paul-Félix Beuvain de Beauséjour was appointed the new Bishop of Carcassonne in 1902. He initially transferred Saunière to the village of Coustouge in January 1909. Saunière refused the nomination and resigned on 28 January 1909, becoming a free priest, Then on 27 May 1910 Monsignor Beauséjour decided to conduct an ecclesiastical investigation and drew up an official Bill of Indictment referring to:

*Trafficking in Masses,
*Disobedience to the bishop,
*Exaggerated and unjustified expenditure to which fees from Masses that have not been said seem to have been devoted.

Saunière had to attend an ecclesiastical trial to answer these charges.

===First two hearings===
Saunière did not attend the first hearing on 16 July 1910 nor on the rescheduled date 23 July when he was sentenced in his absence: incurring a one-month suspension and ordered to refund the money he obtained from selling Masses. He also did not attend the second hearing on 23 August, but managed to attend on the rescheduled date 5 November 1910, when he was sentenced &quot;to withdraw to a house of priestly retreat or into a monastery of his choice, there to undertake spiritual exercises for a period of ten days&quot; for trafficking in Masses and for accepting more money than he was able to say Masses for. He served his penance in the monastery of Prouille.

On 17 December 1910, Saunière unsuccessfully appealed to &quot;The Sacred Congregation of The Council&quot; in Rome for his reinstatement as parish priest of Rennes-le-Château, with &quot;The Sacred Congregation&quot; passing this information on to the Carcassonne Bishopric. The bishop issued a strong warning against Saunière in 1911, forbidding him to administer the sacraments, published in &quot;La Semaine religieuse de Carcassonne&quot; dated 3 February 1911 and in &quot;La Croix&quot; dated 9 February 1911.

The bishopric was not satisfied and by formal command asked Saunière to produce his account books by 2 March the latest in a letter dated 18 February 1911. A Commission of Enquiry was established to further scrutinize Saunière&#x27;s financial activities.

On 13 March 1911, Saunière submitted 61 invoices relating to the renovation of his church and the building of his estate that came to the total of 36,250 francs. On 25 March 1911 he submitted a letter of explanation to the bishopric outlining the source of his finances, with a &quot;List of Donors&quot; giving details of his entire income since becoming priest of Rennes-le-Château, producing an exaggerated amount totaling 193,150 francs. In a letter dated 14 July 1911 Saunière provided a statement of expenditure on the renovation of his church and building of his estate, producing an exaggerated amount totaling 193,050 francs (claiming the Villa Bethania cost 90,000 francs, and the Tour Magdala 40,000 francs).

On 4 October, the Commission of Enquiry submitted its report: only about 36,000 francs could be accounted for out of the 193,150 francs that Saunière claimed to have spent, and commented that Saunière refused to cooperate with the enquiry. Another hearing had to be arranged where Saunière had to produce his account books for inspection by the bishopric.

===Third hearing===
Saunière did not attend the third hearing on 21 November 1911 and was sentenced in his absence on 5 December 1911 to three months&#x27; suspension. Although Saunière&#x27;s suspension was only temporary – for three months – the priest&#x27;s reinstatement depended on the ecclesiastical judgement that he had to &quot;undertake the restitution into the hands of the rightful owner and according to canon law of the goods misappropriated by him&quot;, which the priest was unable to do.

==Later years==
Following the ecclesiastical trial, Saunière lived the rest of his life in poverty, selling religious medals and rosaries to wounded soldiers who were stationed in Campagne-les-Bains.

Whatever money Saunière was still raising from selling Masses was used on his appeal to Rome that his lawyer, Abbé Jean-Eugène Huguet (doctor of canon law), was working on. In May 1914, Saunière planned to build a summer house, but abandoned the project because he could not afford the 2,500 francs required.

François Bérenger Saunière died on 22 January 1917, his suspension lifted at the moment of death (&quot;in articulo mortis&quot;) by Abbé Jean Rivière, who performed the last rites. His death certificate dated 23 January 1917 was signed by Victor Rivière, the mayor of Rennes-le-Château. Saunière was buried on 24 January 1917. Marie Dénarnaud paid for Saunière&#x27;s coffin on 12 June 1917.

In September 2004, the mayor of Rennes-le-Château exhumed Saunière&#x27;s corpse from the cemetery and reburied it in a concrete sarcophagus to protect it from grave-robbers. Since then, the cemetery of Rennes-le-Château has been closed to the general public.

==Controversy==
The controversy around Saunière originally centred on parchments he is said to have found hidden in the old altar of his church, relating to the treasure of Blanche of Castile, the putative source of his income.

===The popular story of Saunière&#x27;s wealth===
After opening his restaurant at Rennes-le-Château in the mid-1950s, Noël Corbu circulated the story that, in 1891, Saunière discovered parchments in the hollow pillar beneath his altar, and that these related to the treasure of Blanche of Castile. &#x27;According to the archives&#x27; her treasure consisted of 28,500,000 gold piecesthe treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche to pay the ransom of Saint Louis (a prisoner of the Egyptians during the Seventh Crusade) whose surplus she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had found only one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.

Corbu&#x27;s story later achieved national fame through articles in the press, eventually catching the attention of Pierre Plantard and inspiring the 1967 book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; by Gérard de Sède.

The book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; by Gérard de Sède (with the unpublicised collaboration of Pierre Plantard) contained elements relating to the fictitious secret society the Priory of Sion, reproducing &quot;parchments&quot; that alluded to the survival of the Merovingian line of Frankish kings from Dagobert II, and Pierre Plantard claimed to be descended from that monarch. Pierre Plantard and Gérard de Sède fell out over book royalties when &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; was published in 1967 and Plantard&#x27;s friend Philippe de Chérisey revealed that he fabricated the parchments.

===Holy Blood, Holy Grail===
In 1969, the English scriptwriter Henry Lincoln read the paperback version of &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; and then between 1972 and 1979 produced three BBC Two &quot;Chronicle&quot; documentaries on the subject matter. Lincoln was also directed to one of Plantard&#x27;s planted documents, &quot;Les Dossiers Secrets&quot; in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Later, Lincoln teamed up with two other authors, and co-wrote the 1982 book &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;. Unaware they were relying on forged documents as a source, they stated as a fact that the Priory of Sion had existed. &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; claimed that Saunière possibly found evidence that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married, and produced offspring that eventually became the Merovingian dynasty. The authors speculated that Saunière engaged in financial transactions with a man they claimed was Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria, and Saunière could have been the representative of the Priory of Sion, and his income could have originated from the Vatican &quot;which might have been subjected to high-level political blackmail by both Sion and the Habsburgs&quot;. The book was an international bestseller, inspiring Dan Brown&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

Hypotheses surrounding Saunière have proliferated over the last few decades, as different authors elaborate on the story of the priest&#x27;s activities and discoveries in and around his church during its 1887 renovations.

===The actual source of Saunière&#x27;s wealth===
The first scholarly book on Saunière&#x27;s activities was by a local historian and chief librarian of Carcassonne, René Descadeillas, who sifted through the priest&#x27;s account books and personal correspondence, as well as the records of Saunière&#x27;s ecclesiastical trial lodged in the Carcassonne Bishopric. He concluded in his 1974 &quot;Mythologie du trésor de Rennes: histoire véritable de l&#x27;abbé Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château&quot; that there never was any treasure or mystery; all of the priest&#x27;s wealth was generated from selling Masses and accepting donations. This conclusion was shared by the local priest and author Abbé Bruno de Monts, who himself contributed essential information during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as by other French authors such as Jean-Jacques Bedu and more recently David Rossoni.

The 2005 Channel 4 documentary &quot;The Real Da Vinci Code&quot; presented by Tony Robinson arrived at the same conclusion, followed by the 2006 CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot; documentary &quot;Priory of Sion&quot;, presented by Ed Bradley: &quot;The source of the wealth of the priest of Rennes-le-Château was not some ancient mysterious treasure, but good old fashioned fraud.&quot;

According to canon law, priests are ordinarily allowed to say one Mass per day, with permission regularly granted to say two or three on Sundays, solemnities, and feast days (although not in Saunière&#x27;s time, with the exception of All Soul&#x27;s Day and Christmas); however, they may accept a stipend or &quot;Mass offering&quot; for only one Mass per day. Saunière, however, had been soliciting and accepting money via the post to say thousands of Masses, charging one franc per Mass. Some clients would send payment for hundreds of Masses, which he never actually performed. The question of why clients should request masses from the impoverished priest of a rural church has not been pursued as enterprisingly.

Reviewing Descadeillas&#x27; &quot;Mythologie du trésor de Rennes&quot; in 1976, church historian Raymond Darricau commented: &quot;To begin with there was nothing: Saunière was just a schemer. Today however we find ourselves confronted with a genuine esoteric construction: Rennes-le-Château has been promoted to the rank of ‘mystical capital’ of the Languedoc&quot; and &quot;the manner in which the myth of Rennes-le-Château has grown to its present status is certainly worthy of reflection and could perhaps provide someone with material for a dissertation on precisely how stories of this kind come into existence.&quot;

==Details of expenditure==
Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière, preserved by his servant Marie Dénarnaud and inherited by Noël Corbu, reveal that the renovation of the church, including works on the presbytery and cemetery, cost 11,605 francs over a ten-year period between 1887 and 1897. With inflation that figure is equivalent to approximately 4.5 million Euros as of 2019. The construction of Saunière&#x27;s estate that included the Tour Magdala and Villa Bethania (and the purchases of land) between 1898 and 1905 cost 26,417 francs, or over 10 million euros today.

==In popular culture==

*The French Television Channel France 3 made a 6-part miniseries &quot;L&#x27;Or du diable&quot; in 1989 about Bérenger Saunière directed by Jean-Louis Fournier, casting Jean-François Balmer as the priest, based on the novel of the same name by Jean Michel Thibaux published in 1987.
*Bérenger Saunière&#x27;s wealth and supposed secret findings (unnamed this time) inspired the plot of Tim Powers&#x27; 1997 novel &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot; and Marco Buticchi&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Menorah&quot;, in which Saunière is supposed to have found the &quot;seven-branched candelabra of the Temple of Jerusalem&quot;.
*The life and mysteries of Saunière were also used as basis for the plot of the 1999 video-game &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;, a 3D adventure written by Jane Jensen and developed by Sierra On-Line. The plot also revolves around the history of the Knights Templar, the supposed conspiracies relating to the Freemasons, and the Priory of Sion as well as Jesus.
*In Season 2 episode 10 of the HBO Cable-television series &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, a &quot;Saunière Manuscript&quot; (located in Rennes-le-Château) is mentioned by the character Henry &#x27;Hack&#x27; Scudder (played by John Savage) in the episode &quot;Cheyenne, WY&quot; (first aired 13 March 2005).
*Saunière is a part of the plot line of &quot;The Templar Legacy&quot; by Steve Berry. The story again weaves Saunière into the hunt for the supposed Templar treasure.

<text>HMS &quot;Juno&quot; was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy (RN). Like the rest of the class, &quot;Juno&quot; was named after a figure of mythology. She was built by Thornycroft of Woolston, Hampshire. &quot;Juno&quot; was launched on 24 November 1965 and commissioned on 18 July 1967.

==Operational service==
&quot;Juno&quot; had a variety of deployments from commissioning in 1967 that culminated in a 1969 Far East Deployment, visiting a variety of ports in countries, including St Vincent, Panama, Peru, Chile, Tristan de Cunha, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Mombasa, Diego Suarez, Gan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and Simonstown, returning to the UK towards the end of 1970. Between 1967 and 1969 she was commanded by Captain R D Lygo. &quot;Juno&quot; was one of a number of Leanders that undertook the Beira Patrol, in this case for five weeks while on her way back to the UK in 1969. The Beira Patrol was a deployment designed to stop oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique. Between 1967 and 1974, she was the senior ship (known as &#x27;Captain D&#x27;) of the 4th Frigate Squadron. Between 1971 and 1973 she was commanded by Captain A Whetstone. In 1972 she spent some months in the Mediterranean travelling as far as Greece before returning to Gibraltar as guard ship. Later that year she was sent North to Icelandic waters for &quot;Cod War&quot; duties.

In the 1970s &quot;Juno&quot; was one of the six Leanders used as the fictional &quot;HMS &quot;Hero&quot;&quot; for the BBC TV drama series &quot;Warship&quot;. All members of the crew were given &quot;Hero&quot; cap tallies for filming purposes.

In 1976, &quot;Juno&quot; took part in the Third Cod War, a fishing dispute against Iceland. On 6 February, while on a Fishery Protection Patrol, &quot;Juno&quot; collided with ICGV &quot;Týr&quot;, which had already engaged several RN vessels. The ramming caused a minor fire. &quot;Juno&quot; made a second patrol, and on 12 March it again collided with &quot;Týr&quot;.

Following the damage received whilst undertaking fishery protection duties, &quot;Juno&quot; underwent a substantial refit in 1977, and following intensive workup at Portland in March 1978, joined the 5th Frigate Squadron for a nine-month deployment. Ports visited during this time included Brest, Bermuda, Belize, Tortolla, Panama, San Diego, Victoria, Prince Rupert, San Francisco, Acapulco, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominica and Key West.

During the visit to Dominica in November 1978, &quot;Juno&quot; was the warship present when Princess Margaret formally handed over independence. For the ceremony at the cricket pavilion, Juno provided the ceremonial guard and colour party.

In 1980, &quot;Juno&quot; joined the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a NATO multi-national squadron, a role &quot;Juno&quot; was familiar with, having often deployed with NATO multi-national squadrons. The following year, &quot;Juno&quot;, due to the 1981 Defence Review by the defence minister John Nott, was placed in reserve when she joined the standby squadron. In 1985, &quot;Juno&quot; completed a four-year refit, which removed all her weapons and converted her into a navigational training ship. The following year &quot;Juno&quot; while the navigational training ship grounded in the Solent, which forced her to receive repairs. In 1987 she collided with the Type 21 frigate &quot;Active&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Juno&quot; decommissioned in November 1992. She was sold for scrap in 1994.

<text>Adobe LiveMotion was a product created by Adobe Systems released in 2000 and perceived as a direct competitor to Macromedia Flash. It replaced the discontinued Adobe ImageStyler program, which Adobe had sold from 1998 to 2000.

LiveMotion was used to create interactive animated graphics. It was able to export to a variety of formats, including QuickTime and Macromedia Flash. LiveMotion has an interface and motion timeline similar to After Effects and had the ability to share files across using the Adobe exchange file format.

Adobe released LiveMotion and LiveMotion 2.0 before discontinuing development November 15, 2003 because of poor sales due to fierce competition from its rival. In early 2005, Adobe and Macromedia announced that they would merge, which would likely have resulted in the LiveMotion project being scrapped anyway.
