<text>The North Clyde Line (defined by Network Rail as the &quot;Glasgow North Electric Suburban&quot; line) is a suburban railway in West Central Scotland. The route is operated by ScotRail. As a result of the incorporation of the Airdrie–Bathgate rail link and the Edinburgh–Bathgate line, this route has become the fourth rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

== Route ==

The North Clyde Line (known as Dunbartonshire - Glasgow, Cumbernauld and Falkirk Grahamston in timetables), electrified by British Rail in 1960, ran east–west through the Greater Glasgow conurbation, linking northern Lanarkshire with western Dunbartonshire, by way of the city centre. Fifty years later, in 2010, the line was extended by Network Rail east from Airdrie, by way of re-opening the line to Bathgate meeting up with the line re-opened by British Rail from Edinburgh.

The main core of the route runs from to via and Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level). To the east of the Glasgow city centre, there is a short branch to , while to the west there are two routes between and (via and via ), as well as branches to and .

The lines from to Dalmuir and Milngavie are also used by Argyle Line services, whilst West Highland Line services share the line between and . In the east, the line between Newbridge Junction and is shared with the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line and the Edinburgh to Dunblane Line. In addition to the interchange with services from Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) and Edinburgh Waverley, there are interchanges with the Cumbernauld Line at Springburn, with the Maryhill Line at , and with the Glasgow Subway at Partick. Some sections of the North Clyde Line are also traversed by freight trains.

The line runs through central Glasgow, and the principal station on the line is Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level). The section through the city centre largely runs in tunnels between High Street and the former Finnieston station (west of Charing Cross at the intersection of Argyle Street and Kent Road). This is the oldest stretch of underground railway in Glasgow, opened as the Glasgow City &amp; District Railway in 1886 and predating the Glasgow Subway by some ten years.

=== Lists of Openings, Closures, and Re-openings ===

====Constituents====
Like most of Glasgow&#x27;s suburban railways, the North Clyde Lines as they are known today were built piecemeal from a patchwork of routes from various Victorian-era railway companies. In addition to the extension east of Airdrie, these are listed below:

* 1842 - Haymarket to Newbridge Junction opened by Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway;
* 1846 - Edinburgh Waverley to Haymarket opened by Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway;
* 1849 - Newbridge Junction to Polkemmet Junction opened by Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway;
* 1850 - Dumbarton Central to Balloch Pier opened by Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway;
* 1858 - Cowlairs to Bowling and Dalreoch to Helensburgh Central opened by Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway;
* 1862 - Polkemmet Junction to Coatbridge Sunnyside opened by Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway;
* 1863 - Westerton to Milngavie opened by Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway;
* 1870 - Coatbridge Sunnyside to Bellgrove opened as the Coatbridge Branch of North British Railway;
* 1870 - Bellgrove to High Street Junction opened by City of Glasgow Union Railway;
* 1871 - High Street Junction to College opened as the Coatbridge Branch of North British Railway;
* 1874 - Stobcross to Maryhill opened by Stobcross Railway;
* 1874 - Anniesland to Whiteinch opened by Whiteinch Railway;
* 1875 - Springburn to Bellgrove opened by City of Glasgow Union Railway;
* 1882 - Jordanhill to Clydebank East opened by Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway;
* 1886 - High Street to Stobcross, Hyndland branch, Jordanhill cord, and Anniesland to Westerton cord opened by Glasgow City and District Railway;
* 1891 - Bowling to Dumbarton Central opened by Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway;
* 1892 - Bridgeton Central to High Street opened by Glasgow City and District Railway;
* 1897 - Clydebank to Dalmuir opened by Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway;

The majority of these lines were absorbed by (or were subsidiaries of) the North British Railway; the exceptions being the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway, which was part of the Caledonian Railway, and the western part of the Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway (which was joint between the North British and the Caledonian). At the time of the Grouping in 1923, the North British Railway became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), while the Caledonian Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS).

====Closures====
Following nationalisation in 1948, all of the lines came under the ownership of British Railways. A number of former LNER branch lines which fed into the North Clyde system were closed during the 1950s because they duplicated former LMS lines. Other lines closed due to lack of traffic, or later because they were not selected for inclusion in the electrification project. Notable withdrawals of passenger service occurred on:

* 1 May 1930: Manuel and Bathgate to Coatbridge Central (via Blackstone);
* 2 April 1951: Whiteinch Victoria branch, also the Kelvin Valley Line (Maryhill to Kilsyth);
* 10 September 1951: Bothwell to Coatbridge Sunnyside;
* 15 September 1952: Hamilton to Bothwell;
* 4 July 1955: Bothwell to Shettleston;
* 9 January 1956: Ratho to Airdrie;
* 14 September 1959: Clydebank East terminus;
* 5 November 1960: Hyndland branch (replaced by new Hyndland station on main line)
* 5 November 1979: branch (replaced by on the Argyle Line)
* 28 September 1986: Balloch Central to Balloch Pier

====Re-openings====

* 24 March 1986: Newbridge Junction to Bathgate (passenger services)
* May 1989: Airdrie to Drumgelloch
* 18 October 2010: Drumgelloch to Bathgate (line open for driver training and charter trains)
* 12 December 2010: Drumgelloch to Bathgate (passenger services)

===Electrification===

In 1960 the remainder of the North Clyde suburban system (Airdrie, Springburn and Bridgeton Central to Milngavie, Balloch Pier and Helensburgh Central, including both routes between Partick and Dalmuir) underwent electrification. After a ceremony on Saturday 5 November 1960, a free public service of electric trains ran on Sunday, and the full normal advertised public service started on Monday 7 November 1960. A new junction between the former LNER and LMS lines was built at Dunglass, just west of Bowling, allowing North Clyde Line services to use the former LMS (Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire) line through , and the original LNER (Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction) line from Dunglass to Dumbarton Central was closed. The outer areas were electrified to the 25 kV AC 50 Hz standard, with the central area, the Springburn, Bridgeton, and Milngavie branches, and the Yoker line being at 6.25 kV AC due to restricted clearances in tunnels. As insulation technology improved these lines were eventually converted to 25 kV.

In October 2010, the line between Bathgate and Airdrie opened complete with electrification at 25 kV for crew training and charter trains. The section between Bathgate and Haymarket (including the section that is common with the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line east of Newbridge Junction) was also electrified at 25 kV. This work was carried out as part of the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link.

===Argyle line===

The former Caledonian Railway lines in north-west Glasgow and Dunbartonshire (Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway and Glasgow Central Railway) closed to passengers and then freight. However, the section from through Glasgow Central (Low Level) was reopened as the Argyle Line in 1979. A new flying junction was built east of Partick to connect the Argyle Line with the North Clyde Line. The Bridgeton Central branch closed to passengers on 5 November 1979, having been replaced by the re-opened Bridgeton Cross station on the Argyle Line, though Bridgeton Central station was retained as a carriage cleaning facility. On 17 December 1979, Partickhill station was replaced by the new Partick (Interchange) slightly to the south, which provides a connection with the Subway.

=== Balloch Pier ===
Pleasure steamer operations on Loch Lomond ceased in the 1980s, leading to the closure of Balloch Pier on 28 September 1986. The Balloch branch was further truncated in April 1988 when Balloch Central was replaced by the new station on the opposite site of Balloch Road, which allowed the elimination of a level crossing. The catenary from the closed section to Balloch Pier was then used to reopen the line east of Airdrie to a new terminus at Drumgelloch in May 1989.

=== Airdrie–Bathgate rail link ===
Passenger services from Edinburgh to Airdrie ceased in 1956, but the line between Edinburgh and Bathgate was reopened to passenger traffic on a trial basis in 1986 and proved an instant success. In 2005, the Scottish Executive declared that in line with plans to upgrade the remaining section of the A8 road to motorway standard, public transport links between Glasgow and Edinburgh must also be improved. Therefore, to create a fourth direct rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, the closed section of the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway between and the 1989 Drumgelloch station was re-opened, and the existing lines from Newbridge Junction to Bathgate and Drumgelloch to Airdrie were upgraded. The whole line is double track and electrified, with a maximum line speed of . The existing 30-minute frequency Helensburgh–Drumgelloch and Milngavie–Airdrie services have been extended to providing an enhanced 15 minute frequency between Bathgate and Edinburgh.

The new link received the final approval of the Scottish Parliament on 28 March 2007 and gained Royal Assent on 9 May 2007. Work commenced with a sod cutting ceremony at in June 2007, with reinstatement of double track between Newbridge and Bathgate being the first stage, completed in October 2008.

The line opened for driver training and charter trains in October 2010, with the passenger service commencing on 12 December 2010.

=== Cumbernauld Line ===

As part of the wider Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP), plans were made to electrify the Cumbernauld Line and the Garngad Chord, adjacent to Springburn, creating an electrified link between the Springburn branch of the North Clyde Line and the Cumbernauld Line - then operated by diesel multiple units into Glasgow Queen Street High Level - allowing electric service from Cumbernauld into the Low Level of Glasgow Queen Street, and thus connecting Cumbernauld to destinations west of Glasgow, whilst also freeing up capacity on the High Level lines out of Queen Street. Contracts for the improvements were let out in January 2013, with completion scheduled in time for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. From May 2014, electric trains began running between Balloch/Dalmuir and Cumbernauld (Monday - Saturday) and Partick and Cumbernauld (Sunday) using class 318, 320, and 334. As the reinstatement of the Garngad Chord was cancelled, the through-service trains had to reverse at Springburn station. Following the completion of EGIP, through electric services from Glasgow Queen Street High Level to Edinburgh Waverley via Cumbernauld were introduced using new Class 385 units, replacing the services which previously reversed at Springburn.

===Historic===
Prior to electrification, passenger services were operated primarily by tank engines, notably Class N2 0-6-2T and Class V1/V3 2-6-2T, which were allocated to depots at Parkhead and Kipps (Coatbridge).

Electrification brought the introduction of the legendary and locally-built Class 303 EMUs, operated from a new depot at the former Hyndland terminus station. From 1967 they were joined by the similar Class 311 EMUs, which were built for the Inverclyde Line electrification but which were initially allocated to Hyndland for maintenance and were occasionally used on the North Clyde Line. The Class 303 and 311 trains were nicknamed the &quot;Blue Trains&quot; because of the bright Caledonian Blue colour scheme they carried in the 1960s, at a time when most British Railways passenger stock was painted either green or maroon. In the late 1960s they began to be repainted in the new standard Rail Blue, and from the late 1970s they received coaching stock blue/grey livery. This was followed by the distinctive Strathclyde PTE orange-and-black scheme in the 1980s. A few of the last surviving Class 303s eventually received the new SPT carmine/cream livery in the late 1990s. In September 2008 Transport Scotland announced that the SPT carmine and cream livery would be discontinued; trains will start to be repainted in a new, blue livery with white Saltire motifs at the ends of each carriage.

In the 1970s, a new electric locomotive/EMU depot was built at Shields Road south of the Clyde, and this took over maintenance of the EMUs used on the Cathcart Circle and Inverclyde Lines, including all of the Class 311s. The reopening of the Argyle Line in 1979 resulted in the introduction of Class 314 EMUs, which were allocated to Hyndland. Although used almost exclusively on the Argyle Line, some North Clyde Line services were also operated by Class 314s. In 1987, Hyndland depot closed and was replaced by new carriage sidings at Yoker, with maintenance transferred to Shields Road. Thereafter, Class 311s began to appear more frequently on some North Clyde services. However, it was not until 1990 that a start was made on replacing the Class 303s, which still operated the great majority of services on the North Clyde Line.

Class 320 EMUs were introduced in 1990 and took over most North Clyde services, enabling the withdrawal of many Class 303s and all of the 311s. A few Class 303 units continued to operate on the North Clyde Line until December 2002, when they were finally withdrawn. They were replaced by the Class 334 Alstom &quot;Juniper&quot; EMUs, together with Class 318 units which had been cascaded from the Ayrshire Coast Lines. The Class 318s and 334s also replaced the Class 314 units on the Argyle Line, and these were in turn displaced to the Cathcart Circle and Inverclyde Lines to replace the last 303s.

===Present stock===
Class 334s currently operate services through to Edinburgh via Bathgate and a handful of North Clyde Line services, with Class 320s and Class 318s operating the majority of North Clyde Line services and Argyle Line services. Class 318s and Class 320s are not permitted to operate in service east of Airdrie due to the lack of CCTV and platform mirrors for the driver to check the doors; the Class 334s have CCTV installed onboard.

== Future development ==

=== Crossrail Glasgow ===

With many passengers travelling north–south through the city centre having to walk or use a shuttle bus between Central and Queen Street stations, SPT has long proposed a direct rail link between the North Clyde system and the lines radiating from Glasgow Central (High Level). This would allow direct service from Renfrewshire and Ayrshire stations to Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level), and would also allow new cross-city services such as Airdrie to Paisley. The plan would involve re-opening to passenger traffic the freight-only City Union Line between Shields Junction and Bellgrove, and building a new curve between Gallowgate and High Street. Reopening of the closed line from Strathbungo to Gorbals would allow trains from Barrhead and East Kilbride to use Crossrail. Funding for the scheme has yet to be sought, and the project remains a long-term aspiration only.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 11 September 1986 two railwaymen were killed in a collision between two trains at Bridgeton Central carriage sidings;
* On 6 March 1989 two people were killed when two trains collided head-on at Bellgrove.

<text>Sharon Janny den Adel (born 12 July 1974) is a Dutch singer who is the lead vocalist of the symphonic metal band Within Temptation. She has been performing since age 14, and co-founded Within Temptation with partner Robert Westerholt in 1996. She was also elected to be the Dutch chairperson of the jury for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018.

== Early life ==
Sharon Janny den Adel was born on 12 July 1974 in Waddinxveen. She lived in Indonesia for five years as a child. The Balinese dancers that she saw during that time inspired her dance movements on stage. After returning from Suriname to the Netherlands, she was bullied by classmates because of her different clothing style, hairstyle, and darkened skin. From the age of 14, she performed with various bands, including a blues rock band called Kashiro. As their partnership grew, in 1996 they came to form a band called The Portal, though the name was changed to Within Temptation before their debut recording. Den Adel has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in fashion design.

== Career ==
=== Training and voice ===
Sharon never formally studied singing and stated in a 2006 interview that she had sung a short while in a choir and was mostly self-taught. She used to practice alone three or four hours per day. She has been described as possessing a mezzo-soprano voice.

=== Within Temptation ===


Robert Westerholt and den Adel formed Within Temptation (initially called The Portal, though the name was changed before their first recording) in 1996. Westerholt had introduced den Adel to his music when he performed with the band The Circle, which was sonically similar to the music that Within Temptation would make. She has defined their work as epic and cinematic. Her vocals play a major role in the band&#x27;s sound, despite having never received formal vocal training.

Before Within Temptation became famous, she worked for a fashion company, leaving after the band found success with their hit single &quot;Ice Queen&quot;. She utilizes her fashion expertise by designing her stage costumes and the band&#x27;s merchandise. About.com described den Adel as a &quot;versatile and skilled singer who is equally adept at singing powerfully with a full orchestra and choir as she is at singing quietly and emotionally with just a piano.&quot; When asked if she prefers to sing in Dutch or English, den Adel said that she favors the latter because &quot;Dutch just doesn&#x27;t fit to our music style. It is also not the nicest language to sing in. Italian or Spanish would then be better options.&quot;

The band were invited several times to compete at the Eurovision Song Contest as the Dutch representatives, but they have declined every time since they find it not the best place for a metal band to present themselves. In 2018, den Adel was then selected as a juror for that year&#x27;s edition.

=== My Indigo ===

On 9 November 2017, den Adel announced on the Dutch TV-show RTL Late Night, that on the following day 10 November 2017, the first single for her solo project My Indigo, also entitled &quot;My Indigo&quot;, would be released. According to den Adel, the project was originally not intended to be released to the general public as it was for her a form to deal with personal problems, and also due to a writer&#x27;s block for composing for Within Temptation. After two years composing for herself and with regained inspiration to write for Within Temptation, den Adel decided to share the project publicly as a separate project named &quot;My Indigo&quot;. The self titled first album was released on 20 April 2018.

=== Collaborations with other artists ===

Besides her main work on Within Temptation, den Adel has performed on-stage and in the studio with several notable artists from varied musical genres, including Tarja Turunen, Armin van Buuren, After Forever, De Heideroosjes, Oomph!, Delain, Agua de Annique, Anneke van Giersbergen and Evanescence. Before forming Within Temptation, den Adel worked together with Voyage, formed by some of the future Within Temptation members, on the track &quot;Frozen&quot; (not to be confused with the Within Temptation song of the same title).

The vocalist took part in several rock and metal opera projects, singing the part of Anna Held in two of Tobias Sammet&#x27;s Avantasia releases, &quot;The Metal Opera&quot; and &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot;, later also singing the part of the &quot;Muse&quot; in the 2016 album &quot;Ghostlights&quot;. She also took the part of the &quot;Indian&quot; on Ayreon&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;. Den Adel then collaborated on two of Timo Tolkki&#x27;s projects, being a guest vocalist on Timo Tolkki&#x27;s Avalon track &quot;Shine&quot;, for the work &quot;The Land of New Hope&quot;, and was featured in his solo project track &quot;Are You the One?&quot;.

Within the symphonic metal scene, den Adel collaborated with After Forever on the track &quot;Beyond Me&quot;, released on the album &quot;Prison of Desire&quot;, performing the song live with the band at selected concerts. She was part of a duet with Marko Hietala on the track &quot;No Compliance&quot; for Delain&#x27;s album &quot;Lucidity&quot;, also joining the band on selected live performances of the song. Den Adel was one of the guest vocalists invited for Tarja Turunen&#x27;s rendition of Feliz Navidad, which featured an ensemble of names from the heavy metal scene and was released as a benefit single.

Also venturing on other musical genres, den Adel co-wrote and recorded the vocals for the track &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; on Armin van Buuren&#x27;s 2008 trance album &quot;Imagine&quot;, which earned them awards for &quot;Best Progressive House/Trance Track&quot; and &quot;Best video&quot; on the International Dance Music Awards. They performed a special version of the song alongside the Metropole Orchestra at the 2010 edition of the Golden Harp gala ceremony, where van Buuren was awarded for his musical work. At the 2009 edition of the Night of the Proms, den Adel made a guest appearance during John Miles&#x27; performance of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. At the end of 2012, den Adel made an appearance on a charity campaign made by a Belgian radio station to raise money for children singing the chorus of the song &quot;het Meneer Konijn lied&quot; among other Belgian celebrities. The song later topped the Belgian charts. In 2014, den Adel collaborated with Dutch rapper Ali B on the track &quot;Hier&quot;.

In 2020, Sharon was asked by American metal band Evanescence to collaborate with them for their single &quot;Use My Voice&quot;. Along with lead singer Amy Lee, other musicians joined in on the song such as rock vocalists Lzzy Hale, Taylor Momsen, Deena Jakoub and many more as well as Lindsey Stirling. During the co-headlining Worlds Collide tour, den Adel joined the band on stage to perform the song at selected dates.

== Personal life ==
Den Adel and long-term partner and bandmate Robert Westerholt have three children together. Their first child was born in December 2005. In February 2009, Den Adel announced that she was pregnant with her second child, who was born in June 2009. In November 2010, she announced that she was expecting her third child. The birth of her third son was announced in March 2011.
Den Adel and Westerholt eventually married in 2018.

<text>A sublanguage is a subset of a language. Sublanguages occur in natural language, computer programming language, and relational databases.

==In natural language==

In informatics, natural language processing, and machine translation, a sublanguage is the language of a restricted domain, particularly a technical domain. In mathematical terms, &quot;a subset of the sentences of a language forms a sublanguage of that language if it is closed under some operations of the language: e.g., if when two members of a subset are operated on, as by &quot;and&quot; or &quot;because&quot;, the resultant is also a member of that subset&quot;. This is a specific term for what in most linguistic study is referred to a language variety or register.

==In computer languages==
The term sublanguage has also sometimes been used to denote a computer language that is a subset of another language. A sublanguage may be restricted syntactically (it accepts a subgrammar of the original language), and/or semantically (the set of possible outcomes for any given program is a subset of the possible outcomes in the original language).

===Examples===
For instance, ALGOL 68S was a subset of ALGOL 68 designed to make it possible to write a single-pass compiler for this &quot;sublanguage&quot;.

SQL (Structured Query Language) statements are classified in various ways, which can be grouped into sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML).

==In relational database theory==

In relational database theory, the term &quot;sublanguage&quot;, first used for this purpose by E. F. Codd in 1970, refers to a computer language used to define or manipulate the structure and contents of a relational database management system (RDBMS). Typical sublanguages associated with modern RDBMS&#x27;s are QBE (Query by Example) and SQL (Structured Query Language). In 1985, Codd encapsulated his thinking in twelve rules which every database must satisfy in order to be truly relational. The fifth rule is known as the &quot;Comprehensive data sublanguage rule&quot;, and states:

: &quot;A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings, and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:&quot;
:* &quot;Data definition&quot;
:* &quot;View definition&quot;
:* &quot;Data manipulation (interactive and by program)&quot;
:* &quot;Integrity constraints&quot;
:* &quot;Authorization&quot;
:* &quot;Transaction boundaries (begin, commit, and rollback)&quot;

<text>Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top is the second studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on 12 February 1988 by Cash Beat Records.

==Track listing==
All songs written and composed by En Esch and Sascha Konietzko unless otherwise noted.

===Vinyl/Cassette release===


===CD release===
==Reception==
Andy Hinds from Allmusic said that &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; &quot;sounds a little flimsy when compared to the band&#x27;s pile-driving later work&quot;, and that it sounds &quot;like a combination of early Meat Beat Manifesto, &quot;Twitch&quot;-era Ministry, and even...the more primitive stuff of Alien Sex Fiend.&quot;

<text>Arthur James &quot;Zutty&quot; Singleton (May 14, 1898 – July 14, 1975) was an American jazz drummer.

==Career==

Singleton was born in Bunkie, Louisiana, United States, and raised in New Orleans. According to his &quot;Jazz Profiles&quot; biography, his unusual nickname, acquired in infancy, is the Creole word for &quot;cute&quot;. He was working professionally with Steve Lewis by 1915. He served with the United States Navy in World War I. After returning to New Orleans he worked with Papa Celestin, Big Eye Louis Nelson, John Robichaux, and Fate Marable. He left for St. Louis, Missouri, to play in Charlie Creath&#x27;s band, then moved to Chicago, Illinois.

In Chicago, Singleton played with Doc Cook, Dave Peyton, Jimmie Noone, and theater bands, then joined Louis Armstrong&#x27;s band with Earl Hines. In 1928 and 1929, Singleton performed on landmark recordings with Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five. In 1929, he moved with Armstrong to New York City.

In addition to playing with Armstrong in New York, he played with Bubber Miley, Tommy Ladnier, Fats Waller, Jelly Roll Morton and Otto Hardwick. Singleton also played in the band backing Bill Robinson. In 1934, Singleton returned to Chicago. In 1937, he returned to New York, working there with Mezz Mezzrow and Sidney Bechet.

In 1943, Singleton moved to Los Angeles, California, where he led his own band, played for motion pictures, and appeared on the radio program &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot; (1944). He also worked with Slim Gaillard, Wingy Manone, Eddie Condon, Nappy Lamare, Art Hodes, Oran &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Page, and Max Kaminsky.

==Death==
Singleton retired after suffering a stroke in 1970. He died in New York City in 1975, at the age of 77. His wife Margie (sister of Charlie Creath) died in 1982 at the age of 82.

<text>The R.E. Olds Transportation Museum is named for Ransom E. Olds, founder of Oldsmobile and REO, and is located in Lansing, Michigan. It is one of the top-rated automotive museums in the United States.

== Collection ==

The R. E. Olds Museum houses a diverse collection of Oldsmobiles dating from 1897 to 2004. The 1897 Olds, one of four built that year, is on loan from the Smithsonian Institution. There is also a replica of the 1893 steam carriage built by Ransom E. Olds on display, prior to the founding of the Olds Motor Works, which was the official name of Oldsmobile until the 1940s.

This museum also houses automobilia covering nearly a century, including a nearly complete collection of Michigan license plates, early traffic signs and a working 1950s-era traffic signal. A bicycle collection shows the connection between early automakers and cycle makers who had the tools, know-how and creativity to successfully produce an automobile.

It also houses a collection of REO vehicles from the company that Ransom E. Olds created after he resigned from Oldsmobile. A well-known vehicle from that company is the REO Speed Wagon, the namesake of a major band by the same name. Another well-known truck that was made by a successor of that company is the Diamond REO.

Another significant part of this museum&#x27;s collection are items from the Ransom E. Olds household.

The R. E. Olds Museum collection includes multiple electric cars, including an 1899 Olds Motor Works Electric and a 1996 General Motors EV1. The EV1 in the museum&#x27;s collection is one of approximately 40 that were not destroyed when the EV1&#x27;s entire production run was recalled in the early 2000s.

The last Oldsmobile built, a 2004 Alero GLS, was displayed at the museum after it rolled off the assembly line at Lansing Car Assembly. The &quot;Final 500 Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; (#500 of 500) Alero sedan in Dark Cherry Metallic paint was on display at the museum until 2009, when it was moved to the GM Heritage Center in Sterling Heights. The final Oldsmobile was sold to a collector in Florida in late 2017.

== History ==
Plans were in the making for an automotive museum in Lansing as early as 1977. The R. E. Olds Museum opened in May 1981, following years of planning and preview events. Highlights of the initial collection included a 1911 Oldsmobile Limited from the Oldsmobile factory collection, and the first Oldsmobile Toronado produced.

The museum&#x27;s building holds a place in Lansing&#x27;s automotive history, as the home of the Bates automobile. The building was subsequently used as a beer warehouse, and was the original bus garage for CATA at its inception in 1972. Converting the building to a museum required substantial work, performed mostly by volunteers. 

The city leased the building to the museum for $2 per year until 2018, when the museum purchased the building for $2.

The Olds Museum was featured on &quot;American Pickers&quot; in 2011. The museum was the buyer of a 1908-vintage license plate used by the Oldsmobile factory on its test cars.

<text>Swedish cinema is known for including many acclaimed films; during the 20th century the industry was the most prominent of Scandinavia. This is largely due to the popularity and prominence of directors Victor Sjöström and especially Ingmar Bergman; and more recently Roy Andersson, Lasse Hallström, Lukas Moodysson and Ruben Östlund.

Famous Swedish film and TV stars were Anna Q. Nilsson, Victor Sjöström (also director, etc.), Lars Hanson, Warner Oland, Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Kristina Söderbaum, Zarah Leander, Anita Ekberg, Ann-Margret, Viveca Lindfors, Signe Hasso, Mai Zetterling, Max von Sydow, Erland Josephson, Ann Zacharias, Maud Adams, Britt Ekland, Ingrid Thulin, Ernst-Hugo Järegård, Agneta Eckemyr, Harriet Andersson, Bibi Andersson, Sven-Bertil Taube, Bo Brundin, Dolph Lundgren, Joel Kinnaman, Melinda Kinnaman, Pernilla August, Peter Stormare, Lena Olin, Stellan Skarsgård, Malin Åkerman, Alexander Skarsgård, Bill Skarsgård, Alicia Vikander, Izabella Scorupco, Noomi Rapace, Ola Rapace, Mikael Nyqvist, David Dencik, Helena Mattsson, Rebecca Ferguson, Fares Fares, and MyAnna Buringkeso.

==Early Swedish cinema==

Swedish filmmaking rose to international prominence when Svenska Biografteatern moved from Kristianstad to Lidingö in 1911. During the next decade the company&#x27;s two star-directors, Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller, produced many silent films, some being adaptations of stories by the Nobel-prizewinning novelist Selma Lagerlöf. Sjöström&#x27;s most respected films often made use of the Swedish landscape. Stiller fostered the early popularity of Greta Garbo, particularly through the &quot;Gösta Berlings saga&quot; (1924). Many of the films made at the Biografteatern had a significant impact on German directors of the silent and early sound eras, largely because Germany remained cut off from French, British, and American influences through World War I (1914–1918).

The global expansion of the United States after World War I had its consequences in the dynamics of cinema and changed previous favorable market conditions that benefited Sweden&#x27;s film exports to Europe. During wartimes, Hollywood not only was able to conquer its domestic market but also managed to increase its exports to European countries – which produced fewer films during wartime – and even to Latin America. The neutrality of Sweden could have been translated in the fortification of its film industry, which to some extent was true since its production grew relatively during this period, but its market share declined severely. While in 1913, the last year before the War, the American share in Sweden was only about 4%; in 1919, the first year after the war, it was 80%.

Facing the exponential growth of US films and its dominance domestically and internationally, Swedish film production, according to Jan Olsson, &quot;operated with a Nordic […] home base&quot; and felt compelled to adapt its market strategies to the new context to regain relevance. The order of the day was to stop what was called the risk of becoming not only the country but the whole continent a &quot;colony of Film America&quot;. The monopolistic organization of Svensk Filmindustri in 1919 and also its further model of co-productions with other European film companies are one of the first expressions of the paradox that characterized the attempt of consolidating simultaneously a national and a transnational cinema. The difficulty of delimiting how the production begins and ends is not the only restriction that makes these theoretical frameworks potentially problematic, but the multiple discourses that each film express reinforces the complexity that is a supposed property of cultural expressions.

To make Swedish films more appealing to the audiences, the challenge was the maintenance of their specificity – stories with a background based on literature about Nordic countryside was one of the &quot;national&quot; trademarks – with some aspects that made Hollywood successful, such as an agile narrative pace. The new market dynamics established new different aesthetic expressions for Swedish cinema and its narratives expressed the duality between cosmopolitanism and Swedish heritage. &quot;Flickan i frack&quot; (Girl in Tails, Karin Swanström, 1926), for example, represents the convergence of these different perspectives with its portrayal of an urban Stockholm contrasting with the countryside and the desire of the protagonist to become an independent woman but also to be recognized by the Swedish traditionalism.

The attempts of constructing a national cinema able to be also universal was a response to the Hollywood dominance, which, in the end, is the consequence of the consolidation of the United States economic supremacy; after all, European films were not able to develop the same capacity of escalation in production and exhibition. The capitalist tendency of constituting monopolies and concentrating wealth is extended also to cinema. By the end of the 1920s, all major US exhibitors had offices in Sweden.

In the mid-twenties, Sjöström, Stiller, and Garbo moved to the United States to work for MGM, bringing Swedish influence to Hollywood. The departure left a vacuum in Swedish cinema, which subsequently went into a financial crisis. Both directors later returned to Sweden, but Stiller died soon after his return while Sjöström returned to theatre work for most of the remainder of his career.

The advent of the talking movie at the beginning of the 1930s brought about a financial stabilization for Swedish cinema, but the industry sacrificed artistic and international ambitions for this financial success. Some provincial comedies emerged, created for the local market.

==Swedish cinema through WWII==

During World War II Swedish cinema gained artistically, mainly due to the directors Gustaf Molander, Alf Sjöberg, Hasse Ekman, Anders Henrikson and Hampe Faustman. 

==Post-war==
The influential Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman rose to prominence in the fifties after he began making films in the mid-forties. His 1955 film &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; brought him international attention. A year later, he made one of his most famous films, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. In the 1960s, Bergman won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for two consecutive years, with &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (&quot;Jungfrukällan&quot;) in 1960 and &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (&quot;Såsom i en spegel&quot;) in 1961. He won the award again in 1983, for the period family drama &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (&quot;Fanny och Alexander&quot;). Bergman was nominated once for the Best Picture award, for the 1973 film &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (&quot;Viskningar och rop&quot;), the story of two sisters watching over their third sister&#x27;s deathbed, both afraid she might die, but hoping she does. It lost to &quot;The Sting&quot;. Although it was not nominated in the Foreign Language category, gave Bergman the first of three nominations for Best Director. Bergman also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.

Working closely with Bergman, cinematographer Sven Nykvist had a major impact on the visual aspects of Swedish cinema. Twice the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, for &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, Nykvist is considered by many to be one of the greatest cinematographers. He also directed &quot;The Ox&quot; (&quot;Oxen&quot;) (1991), nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1992.

Also starting his career working with Bergman, Vilgot Sjöman debuted in 1962 with &quot;The Mistress&quot; (&quot;Älskarinnan&quot;), but attracted far wider attention in Sweden when his film &quot;491&quot; was banned by Swedish censors due to its explicit sexual content. After cutting, it was released in 1964. Sjöman went on to cause even wider controversy, depicting sexual intercourse in his 1967 film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot; (&quot;Jag är nyfiken – gul&quot;). The United States considered it to be pornography; it was seized by the customs and banned. When the film was eventually released in 1969, the publicity gained from the legal fight and its revolutionary graphic content drew huge crowds, making it the most successful Swedish film export ever, and the most successful foreign film in the US up to this point. Most probably it was instrumental in establishing a view of Swedish cinema – and perhaps of Swedes in general – as having a liberal attitude towards sexuality.

Another Swedish postwar filmmaker of note is Bo Widerberg. His 1963 film &quot;Raven&#x27;s End&quot; (&quot;Kvarteret Korpen&quot;) and &quot;The Man on the Roof&quot; (&quot;Mannen på taket&quot;) are widely regarded as classics. His later works include &quot;The Man from Majorca&quot; (&quot;Mannen från Mallorca&quot;), &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Way&quot; (&quot;Ormens väg på hälleberget&quot;) and &quot;All Things Fair&quot; (&quot;Lust och fägring stor&quot;). Widerberg received three Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign-Language Film, &quot;Raven&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Ådalen 31&quot; and &quot;All Things Fair&quot;, but never won.

Jan Troell started his career as Widerberg&#x27;s director of photography, but could soon debut with his own film &quot;Here&#x27;s Your Life&quot; (&quot;Här har du ditt liv&quot;). He went on to direct &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (&quot;Utvandrarna&quot;) in 1971 and its sequel &quot;The New Land&quot; (&quot;Nybyggarna&quot;) the following year. The films are based on Vilhelm Moberg&#x27;s epic novels about Swedish emigration to America in the 19th century, books extremely well known in Sweden. &quot;The Emigrants&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture. Troell then went to Hollywood, where he directed &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot;, starring Gene Hackman, and &quot;Hurricane&quot;. He returned to Sweden to make &quot;The Flight of the Eagle&quot; (&quot;Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd&quot;), a film about the Swedish explorer Andrée&#x27;s disastrous 1897 polar expedition. The film was nominated for an Academy Awards for best foreign language film. Later works include the controversial &quot;Il Capitano: A Swedish Requiem&quot; (&quot;Il Capitano&quot;), &quot;Hamsun&quot;, about Knut Hamsun, &quot;As White as in Snow&quot; (&quot;Så vit som en snö&quot;), and several documentaries.

In the 1960s Ingmar Bergman saw a comedic duo&#x27;s variety show on Gröna Lund and told his studio &quot;There are two funny guys down at Gröna Lund. Why don&#x27;t you let them do a movie? There aren&#x27;t too many funny movies these days.&quot; The duo was Hans Alfredsson and Tage Danielsson, known as Hasse &amp; Tage, who made a movie called &quot;Svenska bilder&quot;. Their own production company AB Svenska Ord made many more movies after that one, directed either by Hasse or Tage. They include, among others &quot;Docking the Boat&quot; (&quot;Att angöra en brygga&quot;), &quot;The Apple War&quot; (&quot;Äppelkriget&quot;), &quot;The Man Who Quit Smoking&quot; (&quot;Mannen som slutade röka&quot;), &quot;Release the Prisoners to Spring&quot; (&quot;Släpp fångarne loss – det är vår!&quot;), &quot;Ägget är löst&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Picasso&quot; (&quot;Picassos äventyr&quot;), &quot;SOPOR&quot; and &quot;The Simple-Minded Murder&quot; (&quot;Den enfaldige mördaren&quot;). These movies have cult status in contemporary Sweden.

1968 saw the release of Stefan Jarl&#x27;s and Jan Lindqvist&#x27;s documentary &quot;They Call Us Misfits&quot; (&quot;Dom kallar oss mods&quot;). The first in what would become a trilogy, it is an uncompromising account of the life of two alienated teenagers. Stefan Jarl went on to make several other celebrated documentaries in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Contemporary Swedish cinema==
Roy Andersson had a breakthrough with his first feature-length film, &quot;A Swedish Love Story&quot; in 1969, and was awarded four prizes at the International Film Festival in Berlin the same year. Following the financial and critical disaster of his 1975 film &quot;Giliap&quot; he took a two-decade break from film directing. In March 1996, Andersson began filming &quot;Songs from the Second Floor&quot;, that premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Special Jury Prize. Andersson&#x27;s return to filmmaking was a major success with the critics, earning him five Guldbagge Awards in Sweden for best film, direction, cinematography, screenplay and sound.

Director Lasse Hallström made his feature-length film debut in 1975 with the comedy &quot;A Guy and a Gal&quot; (&quot;En kille och en tjej&quot;) featuring the well-known Swedish comic duo Magnus Härenstam and Brasse Brännström. He was the man behind most of ABBA&#x27;s music videos, as well as the film &quot;&quot;. &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot;, released in Sweden in 1985, was nominated for two 1987 Academy Awards, for directing and for adapted screenplay. In 1987, it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Following the film&#x27;s international success, Hallström has worked on American films – &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;Casanova&quot;, among others.

In the comedy genre Lasse Åberg has directed and also starred in some successful films that, although not praised by film critics, were box-office successes and have received cult status. The first one was &quot;Repmånad&quot; in 1979, followed by &quot;Sällskapsresan&quot; in 1980 and its four sequels. Although not part of the &quot;Sällskapsresan&quot; series, &quot;Repmånad&quot; was very similar in style, depicting an inept outsider in various situations and traditions typical for Sweden in a humorous way.

Lukas Moodysson&#x27;s first feature-length film, &quot;Show Me Love&quot; (English language name for the controversial Swedish original title, &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;) was a huge success in Sweden. The lovingly depicted teenage angst of the main characters played well with the audience and won four Guldbagge Awards in 1998. The follow-up &quot;Together&quot; (&quot;Tillsammans&quot;) (2000) was an upbeat comedy, albeit with some darkly satirical undertones, set in a 1970s Stockholm commune. But Moodysson&#x27;s filmmaking then took a radically different direction. The 2002 &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot; (&quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot;) is a dark, tragic story about trafficking in human beings, and the 2004 &quot;A Hole in My Heart&quot; (&quot;Ett hål i mitt hjärta&quot;) deals with an amateur porn movie recording, causing some controversy due to its shocking and disturbing footage.

Other young Swedish filmmakers that have seen major success in recent years include Lebanon-born director Josef Fares, with the comedies &quot;Jalla! Jalla!&quot; (2000) and &quot;Kopps&quot; (2003), and the refugee drama &quot;Zozo&quot; (2005), Iranian-born Reza Parsa with the drama &quot;Before the Storm&quot; (&quot;Före stormen&quot;) (2000), and Maria Blom, with the comedy &quot;Dalecarlians&quot; (&quot;Masjävlar&quot;) (2004).

During the late 1990s early 2000s several young filmmakers started exploring genre-films which had earlier been almost non-existent, Mikael Håfström&#x27;s slasher film &quot;Strandvaskaren&quot;, Anders Banke&#x27;s vampire comedy &quot;Frostbite&quot; which was the first Swedish vampire film, Anders Jacobsson&#x27;s satire &quot;Evil Ed&quot; and Måns Mårlind&#x27;s and Björn Stein&#x27;s fantasy-thriller &quot;Storm&quot;. Non of these films proved to be successful in Sweden but went to receive both acclaim and audience in foreign countries. In 2001 the low-budget comedy-horror film &quot;Terror i Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Önsjön&quot; became Sweden&#x27;s first zombie film.

More recently, Tomas Alfredson&#x27;s (son of Hans Alfredson) romantic vampire film/drama film &quot;Let the Right One In&quot; (&quot;Låt den rätte komma in&quot;) (2008) received widespread acclaim from critics all around the world, becoming one of the best reviewed films of the year. In this particular tale, a bullied boy falls in love with a vampire girl who has just moved in next door. Also in the same year, director Jan Troell returns with yet another period drama, &quot;Everlasting Moments&quot; (&quot;Maria Larssons Eviga Ögonblick&quot;) (2008).

In 2009, the feature films &quot;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&quot; (&quot;Män som hatar kvinnor&quot;), &quot;The Girl Who Played with Fire&quot; (&quot;Flickan som lekte med elden&quot;) and &quot;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot; (&quot;Luftslottet som sprängdes&quot;) became international hits with the first film making more than $100 million worldwide. All three films were based on the hit novels of the same names that together comprise the &quot;Millennium series&quot; by Swedish author/journalist Stieg Larsson.

Another film maker to emerge from Sweden is Ruben Östlund. In 2017 Östlund won the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;The Square&quot; and in 2022 he won it again for &quot;Triangle of Sadness&quot;.

==The Swedish film industry==
The Swedish Film Institute was founded in 1963 to support and develop the Swedish film industry. It supports Swedish filmmakings and allocates grants for production, distribution and public showing of Swedish films in their native country. It also promotes Swedish cinema internationally. Furthermore, the Institute organizes the annual Guldbagge Awards.

Through the Swedish Film Agreement, between the Swedish state and the film and media industry, the Government of Sweden, the TV companies which are party to the agreement, and Sweden&#x27;s cinema owners jointly fund the Film Institute and thus, indirectly, Swedish filmmaking. The agreement usually runs for five years, and due for renewal from 1 January of the next year after expiration.

At a rate of about 20 films a year the Swedish film industry is on par with other comparable North European countries.

In Trollhättan Municipality there is a film production facility known as Trollywood; movies shot there include &quot;Show Me Love&quot;, &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Dogville&quot;. The movie studio Film i Väst centered here produces about half of Sweden&#x27;s full-length films.

<text>Roberto Torres (born 10 February 1938) is a Cuban singer, percussionist, bandleader and producer. Born in Güines, Cuba, he moved to the United States in 1959, where he became involved in the Latin music scenes of New York and Miami. In 1979, he founded two record labels, Guajiro Records and its subsidiary, SAR, both devoted to Cuban music. As a singer and musician, he is famous for his combination of Cuban and Colombian music, which he termed &quot;charanga vallenata&quot;. His biggest hit was a cover version of Simón Díaz&#x27;s &quot;Caballo Viejo&quot;. He was a member of the Sonora Matancera for three years. He has also appeared in music documentaries such as &quot;Son sabrosón: antesala de la salsa&quot;.

On 2 June 2011, the Cuban-American community of Union City, New Jersey honored Torres with a star on the Walk of Fame at Celia Cruz Plaza.

<text>The PT-76 is a Soviet amphibious light tank that was introduced in the early 1950s and soon became the standard reconnaissance tank of the Soviet Army and the other Warsaw Pact armed forces. It was widely exported to other friendly states, like India, Indonesia, Iraq, Syria, North Korea and North Vietnam.

The tank&#x27;s full name is Floating Tank–76 (, &quot;plavayushchiy tank&quot;, or ). &quot;76&quot; stands for the caliber of the main armament: the 76.2 mm D-56T series rifled tank gun.

The PT-76 is used in the reconnaissance and fire-support roles. Its chassis served as the basis for a number of other vehicle designs, many of them amphibious, including the BTR-50 armored personnel carrier, the ZSU-23-4 self-propelled anti aircraft gun, the ASU-85 airborne self-propelled gun and the 2K12 Kub anti-aircraft missile launch vehicle.

==Development==
After World War II, the concept of light tanks was resurrected in the USSR. They were to be used in reconnaissance units and therefore an amphibious ability was essential. The requirements stated that the vehicle should be able to cross water obstacles with little preparation. Many prototypes of such light tanks were built in the late 1940s. The most successful was &quot;объект 740&quot; (Object 740) designed by the engineer N. Shashmurin working at the VNII-100 institute in Leningrad (a research institute of Chelyabinsk Tank Factory ChTZ) in 1949–1950, under an initial supervision of Josef Kotin from Kirov Plant. The vehicle was successful because it had a simple design, good navigational traits and a good cross country capability. At the time, its water-jet design was innovative.

A prototype was built at Kirov Plant in 1950 and the tank was officially adopted on 6 August 1951 with the designation PT-76. Production started at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory (STZ). The tank was subsequently modified. In 1957, the D-56T gun was replaced with the D-56TM - with double-baffle muzzle brake and fume extractor - and the hull was raised by 13 cm; additionally the tank was equipped with new vision and communications devices. First series tanks were subsequently modified, receiving the D-56TM gun and new equipment. In 1959 an improved variant, the PT-76B, was adopted and remained in production until 1967 (main improvements were the D-56TS gun with stabilization and CBRN protection).

In 1964 the United States obtained a PT-76 by undisclosed means. The tank was evaluated by the Tank-Automotive Center in February, and was deemed inferior to existing light American tanks.

==Design==
The PT-76 has a typical tank layout: the steering compartment at the front, the combat compartment in the center and the engine compartment at the back. The tank has a three-man crew, with the commander also acting as the radio operator and gunner. This reduces his effectiveness as an observer. The commander and loader stations are located inside the turret, the commander sits on the left side of the main gun and the loader sits on the right. They have a large oval shaped double hatch, which opens forwards on top of the turret. The driver sits in the center of the front of the hull and has a one piece hatch that opens to the right, with three vision blocks and periscopes located beneath the main gun at the top of the sloping glacis plate. Under the driver&#x27;s seat, there is an emergency hatch that can be used by all crew members. At night, the center periscope is swapped for a TVN-2B night vision device which gives the driver clear vision up to 60 meters.

===Armament===
Its main armament consists of a 76.2 mm D-56T series rifled tank gun, which has an effective range of approximately 1,500 meters and a rate of fire of six to eight rounds per minute. This gun is 42 calibers long. The PT-76 carries 40 rounds for its gun. A typical ammunition load consists of 24 x OF-350 Frag-HE, 4 x AP-T, 4 x API-T and 8 x BK-350M HEAT rounds (with AP-T rounds substituted for HVAP when available). The gun is mounted in an oval dish-type circular truncated cone turret with flat, sloping sides which is mounted over the second, third, and fourth pair of road wheels. All PT-76s have a fume extractor for the main gun at the rear of the turret.

The 7.62 mm SGMT coaxial medium machine gun comes with 1,000 rounds. This weapon has a maximum effective range of 1,000 meters in daylight while the vehicle is stationary, 400 to 500 meters in daylight while the vehicle is on the move and 600 meters at night. Maximum range is 1,500 meters. It can be fired in 2 to 10 round bursts and has a practical rate of fire of 250 rounds per minute and a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. From 1967, the machine gun was replaced with PKT of the same caliber.

The main gun, which is considered light for a modern tank, can fire BM-354P HVAP, API-T, AP-T, BR-350 API-T and OF-350 Frag-HE rounds (as can the 76.2 mm M1942 (ZiS-3) divisional gun) and is capable of penetrating the armour of APCs and other lightly armored vehicles.

The commander/gunner has a cupola on the left side of the double hatch. The cupola has the TPKU-2B observation device and two TNP day periscopes and can be rotated 360 degrees by hand. The commander also has a 4X optical sight mounted to the left of the main armament and a TShK-66 sight/rangefinder. The loader has the MK-4 observation device mounted on the turret&#x27;s roof in front of the hatch.

===Ammunition===

The BM-354P High Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) round has a maximum effective range of 650 meters by day and 600 meters at night. Its maximum aimed range is 1,060 meters. It can penetrate 127 mm of armour at muzzle and 50 mm at 1,000 meters. The armour-piercing round can pierce 60 mm of armor inclined at 60 degrees from a range of 2,000 meters. The BK-350M High Explosive Anti Tank or HEAT round has a maximum effective range of 650 meters by day and 600 meters at night. Its maximum range is 1,000 meters. It can penetrate 280 mm of armour at 1,000 meters. The OF-350 Frag-HE round has a maximum effective range of 600 meters at night and a maximum range of 4,000 meters. The gun can be fired while the vehicle is afloat. The gun can also be depressed and elevated between −4 and +30 degrees so like most Soviet tanks, the PT-76 has a limited ability to depress its main gun, and therefore can have difficulty finding a hull down fire position on higher ground. One of the greatest disadvantages of the gun used on the PT-76 Model 1 was that it had no stabilization system and therefore couldn&#x27;t be effectively fired while the vehicle was on the move. The PT-76 Model 2 has a 1-axis stabilization system and the PT-76B has a 2-axis system.

===Countermeasures===
The armor of the PT-76 consists of homogeneous, cold-rolled, welded steel. Its turret has 20 mm at 35° at the front, 16 mm at 35° at the sides, 11 mm at 33° at the rear and 8 mm at 0° on top of the turret. The hull is made up of: 10 mm at 80° at the upper front, 13 mm at 80° at the lower front, 14 mm at 0° at the sides, 7 mm at 0° in the rear and 5 mm at 0° underneath. This gives it protection against 7.62 mm small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments. It does not protect it against 12.7 mm or .50-caliber armor-piercing heavy machine gun fire or larger shell fragments.

===Mobility===

====Land====
The torsion bar suspension consists of six evenly spaced large rubber-tired road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and the idler at the front. The road wheels are hollow to minimize weight. These hollow road wheels increase the tank&#x27;s buoyancy by 30%. There are no track-return rollers. The first and last road wheels have a hydraulic shock absorber and the steel tracks have 96 links each when new, each link has a single pin. There is a small, thin, horizontal skirt over each track. Its straight 6-cylinder, 4-stroke water-cooled diesel engine was developed under the designation &quot;V-6&quot; by halving the &quot;V-12&quot;-engine from the T-54/55. It develops 240 hp (179 kW) at 1,800 rpm which gives it a road speed of 44 km/h and a range of 370 km to 400 km. The vehicle can cross 1.1 m high vertical obstacles and 2.8 m wide trenches and climb 52° gradients. The engine has a cooling system and an initial heater (intended for use when the air temperature is −20 °C or colder). The PT-76 has a 5-speed manual shaft-type transmission system similar to the one in the T-34/85. The gearbox has four forward gears and one reverse. The vehicle has a side clutch that enables it to make turns and a handbrake. The tank has four mounts for additional external fuel tanks at the rear of the hull. The two on the corners are for flat type external tanks and the two in the center are for a drum type. These additional tanks increase the range from 370 to 400 km to 480–510 km. The PT-76 is a reliable, simple to operate and highly mobile reconnaissance vehicle and is ideally designed for amphibious operations, but it has many limitations as a fighting vehicle.

====Water====
The PT-76 is amphibious, it has a flat, boat-shaped hull which is hermetical and ensures minimal resistance when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle&#x27;s stability and displacement in the water and prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver&#x27;s periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed in the front of the bow under the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left water-jet is covered, to turn to the right, the right water-jet is covered. To make a 180° turn, one water-jet sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2 km/h and has a range of 100 km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.

===Equipment===
The PT-76 is equipped with a tank communication device, a gyro compass, a 10-RT-26E radio with an antenna that extends itself when needed. It also has two headlights in front of the hull and a searchlight on the right-hand side of the top of the turret. It lagged behind other Soviet armoured fighting vehicles because only the driver had a night vision device and also because it has no fire or NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection systems, which significantly reduced its effectiveness. The lack of NBC protection ended with the PT-76B, which has the PAZ (&quot;protivo-atomnaya zashchita&quot;) NBC protection system. Because only the driver has night vision equipment, the crew has a vision range of by day and at night.

==Service history==
About 5,000 PT-76s were built during the vehicle&#x27;s lifetime, of which some 2,000 were exported. Other sources indicate that 12,000 were built. (See footnote 1). Over 25 countries employed the vehicle, including Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, China, Congo, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Guinea, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Madagascar, Mozambique, North Korea, Pakistan, Poland, North Vietnam, and Yugoslavia.

The PT-76 was used as the standard reconnaissance tank of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact armies. It was also intended for water obstacle fording operations and naval infantry landings. It served in the reconnaissance subunits of tank divisions and mechanized divisions of the Red Army and Soviet marines divisions. Although it has been replaced in front line service by the BMP-1, it may still be found in the reconnaissance companies and battalions of some motorized rifle and tank regiments and divisions, as well as in naval infantry units. Aside from its reconnaissance role, it is also used for crossing water obstacles in the first wave of an attack and for artillery support during the establishment of a beachhead. The main disadvantage of the BMP-1 and the BRM-1 when compared to the PT-76 is the absence of a powerful main armament. However, the BRM-1 is fitted with more modern reconnaissance equipment. Also, both vehicles have stronger front armor and superior mobility features and the BMP-1 can carry up to 8 fully equipped soldiers inside. The PT-76 is still on active service in a number of countries mainly in the developing world. The Russian Army is reported to have used PT-76 units in the war in Chechnya.

The PT-76 is used/stationed by/in following Russian units/bases: 61st tank repair plant (1), 61st Kirkinesskaya marine brigade (26) from Sputnik, which is part of the Murmansk military district, 175th marine brigade (26) from Tumannyy, which is part of the Murmansk military district and 336th Belostokskaya marine brigade (26) from Baltyysk, which is part of the Kaliningrad military district.

In Ludowe Wojsko Polskie (LWP), PT-76s and PT-76Bs were used by the reconnaissance subunits of tank divisions and mechanized divisions and Coastal Defense units including the 7th Lusatian Landing Division (officially known as 7th Coast Defense Division). Poland also operated FROG-3 &quot;Luna&quot; tactical missile launch vehicles.

PT-76s were in service with the Indian Army and they were in reserve status before they were withdrawn from service in 2009, after which they were used for target practice by the army and as static memorials at various military facilities.

===Combat service===
====Vietnam War====
Soviet PT-76s along with T-54s, T-55s, and Chinese Type 59s tanks formed the bulk of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) armored forces.

The first successful action of PAVN armor in Vietnam was against the Lang Vei Special Forces camp on 6/7 February 1968 (they had already been used in the preceding Battle of Ban Houei Sane, which was just across the border in Laos however). Thirteen PT-76s, of the PAVN 202nd Armored Regiment spearheaded an assault against approximately 24 Green Berets, 500 South Vietnamese irregulars and 350 Laotian Royal soldiers. The defenders fought back with their 106 mm M40 recoilless rifle (one at the entrance took out three PT-76s until it was knocked out), and ineffectively with M72 LAWs (one-shot disposable 66 mm Light Anti-Tank Weapon). They requested support from nearby Khe Sanh Combat Base, which was unable to help, as it too was under siege. The Lang Vei camp was overrun, with the PT-76s using their turret-mounted spotlight-equipped heavy machine guns to shoot down any irregulars who panicked and ran out of the underground bunkers. A few survivors broke out and were airlifted to safety.

The first tank-to-tank engagement occurred in mid-1968 when a US reconnaissance airplane observed a PT-76 being washed by its crew in the Bến Hải River in the DMZ (17th Parallel). The Forward Air Control pilot radioed the tank&#x27;s position to a nearby M48 Patton tank unit of the US 3rd Tank Battalion. With the FAC adjusting fire, the M48 fired three 90 mm rounds; obtaining a hit with the third round. The tank crew abandoned their vehicle. Shortly afterwards, some returning F-4 Phantom jet fighter bombers, with ordnance to expend, observed the PT-76 and bombed the remainder of the vehicle.

=====Battle of Ben Het=====

The Battle of Ben Het was the only PAVN–US Army tank battle during the course of the Vietnam War. 10 PT-76s faced 3 M48s.
On March 3, 1969, the Special Forces&#x27; Ben Het Camp was attacked by the PAVN 202nd Armored Regiment. The 202nd was given the task of destroying the camp&#x27;s 175 mm self-propelled guns. One of the PT-76s had detonated a land mine, which not only alerted the camp, but also lit up the other PT-76s attacking the firebase. Flares had been sent up, thus exposing adversary tanks, but sighting in on muzzle flashes, one PT-76 scored a direct hit on the turret of a M48, killing two crewmen and wounding two more. A second M48, using the same technique, destroyed a PT-76 with their second shot. At daybreak, the battlefield revealed the wreckage of two PT-76s and one BTR-50 armored personnel carrier.

=====First combat use of the TOW missile=====

The PT-76 was involved in a landmark incident in armored warfare, in being the first victim of the BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile.

On April 24, 1972, the US special experimental &quot;1st Combat Aerial TOW Team&quot; arrived in South Vietnam. It consisted of two UH-1B helicopters mounting the new BGM-71 TOW and technicians from Bell Helicopters and Hughes Aircraft Corporation. It deployed in the Central Highlands, where it commenced gunnery training. From May 2, the team made daily flights in search of enemy armor, with the missiles mounted in the XM26 three-tube launcher. On May 9, PAVN armored units attacked Ben Het Camp; the TOW team destroyed 3 PT-76s and broke up the attack.

On May 26, the PAVN made another attempt to retake the city of Kontum. TOW aircraft were brought in at first light and found PAVN tanks moving almost at will through portions of the city. Conventional air strikes would have been risky for friendly forces, and the TOW proved to be ideal for picking off enemy tanks. At the end of the first day, the two TOW helicopters had destroyed 9 tanks and damaged one more. Four destroyed and one damaged were PT-76s.

====Indian Service====

The PT-76 saw action with Indian forces in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and 1971. The tactics of the Indian Army enabled the PT-76 to play a vital role in the Eastern theater of the 1971 war where the PT-76s proved superior to the obsolete Pakistani M24 Chaffee light tanks despite being outnumbered. A good example of such an engagement was the Battle of Garibpur, where an Indian Army Infantry Battalion with only 14 PT-76s was able to maul a much larger brigade-strength unit of Pakistani armor and inflict heavy casualties.

During the battle 8 Pakistani M24 Chaffee tanks were destroyed, 3 captured at the cost of 2 PT-76.

====Other combat====
The PT-76 also saw service in the Six-Day War (1967) during which the Israeli army destroyed or captured a few PT-76 tanks. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973 PT-76s were used during the crossing of the Great Bitter Lake by the Egyptian 130th Marines Brigade.

The People&#x27;s Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) deployed PT-76s during the Angolan Civil War, as did Cuba during its lengthy military intervention in that country. One FAPLA PT-76 was destroyed by a South African Ratel-90 armoured car during Operation Moduler. At least six others were captured by South African expeditionary forces over the course of that conflict.

During the Yugoslav wars, the PT-76 served with the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and later the army of the Krajina Serbs in a few battles during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia (1991) and Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995).

The Indonesian Marine Corps used its PT-76Bs on the Indonesian island of Ambon during Maluku sectarian conflict in 1999-2003, and also in mid 1970s during Operation Lotus (&quot;Operasi Seroja&quot;).

==Variants==

===Soviet Union===





* PT-76 (Ob&#x27;yekt 740, 1951) – An original PT-76 armed with the D-56T 76.2 mm rifled tank gun (no bore evacuator, long multi-slotted muzzle brake, no fume extractor). It was produced between 1951 and 1957.

* PT-76 (Ob&#x27;yekt 740, 1957) – PT-76 armed with the D-56TM 76.2 mm rifled tank gun (double-baffle muzzle brake, bore evacuator, fume extractor) and a height of the hull was increased by 13 cm. It has night vision driver device TVN-2B, new headlamps, a new R-113 radio instead of the old 10-RT-26E set (it was later replaced by the R-123) and TDA thermo smoke generating system. It also has a spotlight fitted to a bracket on the right-hand edge of the turret roof. This version is sometimes called &quot;PT-76B&quot; in western sources.
* (Ob&#x27;yekt 740B, 1959) – PT-76 armed with the D-56TS 76.2 mm rifled tank gun (double-baffle muzzle brake, cartridge ejector, fume extractor and STP-2P &#x27;Zarya&#x27; 2-axis stabilization system), the PAZ (protivo-atomnaya zashchita) NBC protection system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, improved TShK-2-66 sight, a filtration-ventilation system, improved observation devices, improved electric equipment, a new V-6B 6-cylinder 4-stroke in line water-cooled diesel engine developing 263 hp (196 kW) at 1800 rpm and additional internal fuel tanks for which the shape of the armour had to be slightly changed. These additional internal fuel tanks increased the fuel capacity from 250 L to 400 L. The new engine is the same as that used in one bank of that fitted to the T-54. With the new engine and additional fuel tanks, the range of the vehicle has been increased to 480 km on the road, (590 km with external fuel tanks) and 120 km on the water. The 76.2 mm D-56TS rifled tank gun can fire a new undercaliber AP projectile piercing up to 75 mm at 60° from 2,000 meters. One such round has been added to a PT-76B typical ammunition load and so it can now carry 41 rounds. It was produced between 1959–1967.
** PT-71 (Not to be confused with the Israeli PT-71) – is a PT-76B fitted with 9M14 &quot;Malyutka&quot; (NATO code: AT-3 Sagger) anti-tank guided missile pack mounted on the rear of the turret. It didn&#x27;t reach operational stage, and the name is not official.
* – A designator for different PT-76 and PT-76B models armed with the DShK 1938/46 12.7 mm antiaircraft heavy machine gun on a rotatable mount on top of the turret.
* – Command version with an additional antenna on the right hand side of the turret and a generator at the rear of the deck.

* PT-76M (Ob&#x27;yekt 740M) – PT-76 with improved amphibious features thanks to slightly larger displacement. This variant was developed for the Russian Naval Marines but was not adopted because it did not have improved combat features. Instead the Marines adopted the PT-76B (with a snorkel).
* (Not to be confused with Ob&#x27;yekt 906 or North Korean Type 82) – A PT-76 with a cast turret and an 85 mm gun. It was used during the Invasion of Czechoslovakia.

* PT-85 (Ob&#x27;yekt 906) (Not to be confused with PT-85 with a cast turret or North Korean Type 82) – Based on the chassis of the PT-76, armed with 85 mm D-58 tank gun, two prototypes were built.

* PT-90 (Ob&#x27;yekt 906) – Based on the chassis of the PT-76, armed with 90 mm D-62 tank gun, only at technical design stage.

* Ob&#x27;yekt 280 – PT-76 fitted with a 16x130 mm multi barrel rocket launcher.
* – PT-76 converted to a light amphibious NBC reconnaissance tank. It has a dome cupola and a flag marker at the rear.
*BTR-50P – amphibious tracked APC, based on the chassis of the PT-76.

* Ob&#x27;yekt 911 – experimental IFV, developed by the Gavalov design bureau. The Ob.911 had a tracked suspension but additionally 4 retractable wheels under the hull. The performance advantages of this wheel-cum-track design didn&#x27;t prove themselves and was deemed too complex.

* Ob&#x27;yekt 914 – experimental IFV. This vehicle was developed in the early 1960s by a design team led by I. V. Gavalov at the Volgograd Tractor Works (VTZ) and the prototype was ready for trials in 1964. The Ob.914 was armed with two 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine guns mounted in the hull on either side of the driver. It had a crew of two and could transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers (two of whom operated the PKTs). Its combat weight was 14.4 tons. After a series of trials in 1964, the Ob.765 was selected to become the BMP-1 due mostly to the rear engine design which obliged the infantry to mount and dismount through the single door in the rear of the right hand side of the vehicle and roof hatches. It was also felt that the Ob.765 had a better overall layout.
*ASU-85 – airborne assault gun that uses components of the PT-76.
* SPU 2P2 (S-119A) – launch vehicle of the tactical missile system 2K1 &quot;Mars&quot; (S-122A) (FROG-2).
* TZM 2P3 (S-120A) – transloader vehicle of the tactical missile system 2K1 &quot;Mars&quot;.
* SPU 2P16 (S-123A) – launch vehicle of the tactical missile system 2K6 &quot;Luna&quot; (S-125A) (FROG-3/5).
* TZM 2P17 (S-124A) – transloader vehicle of the tactical missile system 2K6 &quot;Luna&quot;. This was only a prototype.
*GM-568 – Chassis used for the 1S91 guidance vehicle of 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile system. It uses some elements from the PT-76 including the drive train and wheels. It is nearly identical to the GM-578 chassis.
*GM-575 – Chassis used for the ZSU-23-4 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. It uses a number of components from PT-76.
*GM-578 – Chassis used for the 2P25 launch vehicle 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile system. It uses some elements from the PT-76 including the drive train and wheels. It is nearly identical to the GM-568 chassis.
* GSP (Ob&#x27;yekt 55) or GSP-55 – This is a tracked self-propelled amphibious ferry. It consists of two non-interchangeable left and right half units with large outer pontoons. The units use many components of the PT-76, for instance parts of the suspension, the (modified) engine, the electrical system and the steering system. A GSP ferry could carry up to 52 tonnes and had a speed of 6 km/h.

===Belarus===
* PT-76M – An upgraded PT-76 with a UTD-20 engine developing 300 hp (224 kW), new steering and brake systems, designed by Minotor-Service in Minsk. A similar upgrade exists for the BTR-50 series.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

* – The Chinese obtained a few PT-76s in the mid-1950s. In October 1958, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), decided to develop an indigenous amphibious tank based on the PT-76. The development program was carried out by 201 Institute and 615 Factory. A prototype known as the WZ221 was built and tested in 1959, but the design suffered from a number of problems including engine overheating.

<doc id="623439" wikidata="Q52183" url="?curid=623439" title="Sheikh Hasina">
<text>Sheikh Hasina (born 28 September 1947) is a Bangladeshi politician who served as the tenth prime minister of Bangladesh from June 1996 to July 2001 and again from January 2009 to August 2024. She is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh. She served in the position of prime minister for over 20 years, making her the longest-serving prime minister in history of Bangladesh. Thus, she became the world&#x27;s longest-serving female head of government. Her authoritarian regime ended in self-imposed exile following an uprising in 2024.

As the autocratic regime of Hussain Muhammad Ershad came to an end, Hasina, then leader of the Bangladesh Awami League, lost the 1991 election to Khaleda Zia, with whom she had collaborated against Ershad. As leader of the opposition, Hasina accused Zia&#x27;s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of electoral dishonesty and boycotted Parliament, which was followed by violent demonstrations and political turmoil. Zia resigned in favour of a caretaker government, followed by Hasina becoming prime minister after the June 1996 election. The term ended in July 2001, with Hasina being succeeded by Zia following her victory.

During the 2006–2008 political crisis, Hasina was detained on extortion charges. After her release from jail, she won the 2008 election. In the 2014 general election, she was re-elected for a third term in an election that was boycotted by the BNP and criticised by international observers. In 2017, after nearly a million Rohingya entered the country, fleeing genocide in Myanmar, Hasina received credit and praise for giving them refuge and assistance. She won a fourth and fifth term after the 2018 and 2024 elections, which were marred by violence and widely criticised as being fraudulent.

Her second premiership (2009–2024) was marked by economic mismanagement and rampant corruption, leading to rising foreign debt, increasing inflation, youth unemployment and banking irregularities. An estimated US$150 billion or Tk 17.6 lakh crore was syphoned out of Bangladesh by illegal means during this period. In 2022, anti-government protests broke out demanding the resignation of Hasina. In June 2024, fresh student protests erupted throughout the country, demanding the reform of quotas in government jobs. The protests were met with brutal crackdown by law-enforcement agencies and paramilitary forces, resulting in the massacre of students. By August, the protests intensified into a mass uprising against the government, which eventually culminated in Hasina resigning and fleeing to India. In February 2025, a UN OHCHR report found that Sheikh Hasina personally directed and coordinated the crackdown and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the widespread and systematic abuse of human rights during the crackdown may amount to crimes against humanity.

It is widely considered that Bangladesh experienced democratic backsliding under her premiership. Human Rights Watch documented widespread enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings under her government. Numerous politicians and journalists were systematically and judicially punished for challenging her views. In 2021, Reporters Without Borders gave a negative assessment of Hasina&#x27;s media policy for curbing press freedom in Bangladesh since 2014. Hasina has been criticised as being too close to India, often at the cost of Bangladesh&#x27;s sovereignty. She is seen as a manifestation of India&#x27;s interference in Bangladeshi politics, which the critics described as the main source of Hasina&#x27;s power.

Hasina was among &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world in 2018, and was listed as being one of the 100 most powerful women in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2015, 2018, and 2022.

==Early life==

Hasina was born on 28 September 1947 to the Bengali Muslim Sheikh family of Tungipara in East Bengal. Her father was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and her mother was Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib. Hasina grew up in Tungipara during her early childhood under the care of her mother and grandmother. When the family moved to Dhaka, they initially lived in the neighborhood of Segunbagicha.

When Hasina&#x27;s father became a government minister in 1954, the family lived on 3 Minto Road. In the 1950s, her father also worked in the Alpha Insurance Company, aside from his political activities. In the 1960s, the family moved into a home built by her father on Road 32 in Dhanmondi. In many interviews and speeches, Hasina talked about growing up while her father was held as a political prisoner by the Pakistani government. In one interview, she remarked that &quot;For instance, after the United Front Ministry was elected in 1954, and we were living in No 3 Minto Road, one day, my mother told us that father had been arrested the night before. Then we used to visit him in jail and we always realised that he was put in jail so often because he loved the people.&quot; Hasina and her siblings had very little time to spend with their father because of his preoccupation with politics.

===Education and marriage===
Hasina attended primary school in her village of Tungipara. When her family moved to Dhaka, she attended the Azimpur Girls&#x27; School and Begum Badrunnesa Girls&#x27; College. She enrolled for a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Eden College. She was elected as the Vice President of the Students Union in Eden College between 1966 and 1967. In 1967, she married M. A. Wazed Miah, who was a Bengali nuclear scientist with a doctorate in physics from Durham. Hasina studied Bengali literature at Dhaka University, from where she graduated in 1973. Hasina lived in Rokeya Hall, which was founded in 1938 as the women&#x27;s dormitory of Dhaka University; and later named after feminist Begum Rokeya. She was involved in the politics of the Bangladesh Chhatra League and was elected as the general secretary of the women&#x27;s unit in Rokeya Hall.

===Family murder, exile and return===
Except for her husband, children and sister Sheikh Rehana, Hasina&#x27;s entire family was murdered during the 15 August 1975 Bangladeshi coup d&#x27;état which saw the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hasina, Wazed and Rehana were visiting Europe at the time of the assassination. They took refuge in the house of the Bangladeshi ambassador to West Germany; before taking up an offer of political asylum from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. The surviving members of the family lived in exile in New Delhi, India for six years. Hasina was barred from entering Bangladesh by the military government of Ziaur Rahman. After she was elected President of the Bangladesh Awami League on 16 February 1981, Hasina returned home on 17 May 1981 and received a welcome from thousands of Awami League supporters.

==Early political career==
===Movement against military rule (1981–1991)===
While living in exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Awami League in 1981. The party has been described as a &quot;Centre-Left&quot; party.

Under martial law, Hasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, she was put under house arrest in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for another three months.

Hasina and the AL participated in the 1986 Bangladeshi general election held under President Hussain Muhammad Ershad. She served as the leader of the parliamentary opposition in 1986–1987. She led an eight-party alliance as opposition against Ershad. Hasina&#x27;s decision to take part in the election had been criticised by her opponents, since the election was held under martial law, and the other main opposition group boycotted the poll. However, her supporters maintained that she used the platform effectively to challenge Ershad&#x27;s rule. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987 when Hasina and her Awami League resigned in an attempt to call for a fresh general election to be held under a neutral government. During November and December in 1987, a mass uprising happened in Dhaka and several people were killed, including Noor Hossain, an Awami League activist and supporter of Hasina.

Her party, along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) under Khaleda Zia, continued to work to restore democratically elected government, which they achieved after a constitutional referendum returning the country to a parliamentary form of government.

The subsequent parliamentary general election in 1991 was won by the BNP.

===Leader of the Opposition (1991–1996)===
After several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes had paralysed the economy. Government officers refused to follow orders and resigned. Members of the Bangladesh Rifles laid down their weapons instead of firing on protestors and curfew was openly violated. Hasina worked with Khaleda Zia in organising opposition to Ershad. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted Ershad from power when he resigned in favour of his vice president, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court. The caretaker government, headed by Ahmed, administered a general election for the parliament. The BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, won a general majority, and Hasina&#x27;s Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party. Of the three constituencies Hasina contested, she lost in two and won in one. Accepting defeat, she offered her resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders.

Politics in Bangladesh took a decisive turn in 1994, after a by-election in Magura-2, held after the death of the member of parliament for that constituency, a member of Hasina&#x27;s party. The Awami League had expected to win back the seat, but the BNP candidate won through rigging and manipulation, according to the neutral parties who witnessed the election. Hasina led the Bangladesh Awami League in boycotting the parliament from 1994.

==First premiership (1996–2001)==


The Awami League (AL), with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands.

Opposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The Government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that the BNP could resolve the issue by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the members of parliament of the AL and other parties resigned en masse. Parliament completed its five-year term and the February 1996 general election was held. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP, who won all the seats in the parliament as a result. Hasina described the election as a farce.

The new parliament, composed almost entirely of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The June 1996 general election was held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman. The AL won 146 seats, a plurality, but fell short of a simple majority. Khaleda Zia, leader of the BNP who won 104 seats, denounced the results and alleged vote rigging. This was in contrast with the neutral observers who said that the election was free and fair.

Hasina served her first term as Prime Minister of Bangladesh from June 1996 to July 2001. She signed the 30-year water-sharing treaty with India governing the Ganges. Her administration repealed the Indemnity Act, which granted immunity from prosecution to the killers of Sheikh Mujib. Her government opened-up the telecommunications industry to the private sector, which until then was limited to government-owned companies. In December 1997, Hasina&#x27;s administration signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, ending the insurgency in the Chittagong Division for which Hasina won the UNESCO Peace Prize. Her government established the Ashrayan-1 Project while bilateral relations with neighbouring states improved. Hasina&#x27;s government completed the Bangabandhu Bridge mega project in 1998. In 1999, the government started the New Industrial Policy (NIP) which aimed to strengthen the private sector and encourage growth.

The Hasina government implemented some reforms to different sectors of the economy, which resulted in the country attaining an average of 5.5% GDP growth. The consumer price index remained at 5%, lower than other developing states who experienced 10% inflation. The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1997–2002) of the government placed an emphasis on poverty alleviation programmes which provided credit and training to unemployed youths and women. Food-grain production increased from 19 million tons to 26.5 million tons while the poverty rate reduced. A Housing Fund was established to provide fiscal assistance to those homeless as a result of river erosion. The government launched the &quot;Ekti Bari Ekti Khamar&quot; scheme which accentuated the incomes of the poorer segments of society through household farming.

The Hasina government adopted the New Industrial Policy in 1999 which aimed to bolster the private sector and attract foreign direct investment, thus expediating the globalisation process. The NIP aimed for 25% of the economy to be industry based with 20% of the country&#x27;s workforce employed in industry. It encouraged the institution of small, cottage and labour-intensive industries with an onus on skill development for women for employment, development of indigenous technology and industries based on local raw materials. The NIP allowed for foreign investors to own 100% equity in Bangladeshi enterprises without prior approval from the government and all but four sectors of the economy were opened up to the private sector.

Attempts were made to create a social security system to protect the most vulnerable in society. The Hasina administration introduced an allowance scheme which resulted in 400,000 elderly people receiving monthly allowances. This scheme was later extended to widows, distressed and deserted women. A national foundation devoted to rehabilitation and training of people, with disabilities was founded with an initial grant of ৳100 million funded by the government. The Ashrayan-1 Project provided shelter and employment to the homeless.

Hasina was the first prime minister to engage in a &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s Question-Answer Time&quot; in the Jatiya Sangsad. The Jatiya Sangsad repealed the Indemnity Act, allowing for the killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to be prosecuted. The government introduced a four-tier system of local government including the Gram Parishad, Zila Parishad and Upazila Parishad by passing legislation.

The Hasina government liberalised the telecommunications industry, initially granting four licenses to private companies to provide cellular mobile telephone services. This resulted in the previous state monopoly being disbanded meaning prices began to reduce and access became more widespread. The government established the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission to regulate the newly liberalised telecommunications industry.

The government established the National Policy for Women&#x27;s Advancement which sought to ensure equality between men and women. The policy aimed to guarantee security and employment, create an educated and skilled workforce, eliminate discrimination and repression against women, establish human rights and end poverty and ensure participation in socio-economic development. The government introduced three reserved seats for women in all Union Parishad election in December 1997. Hasina&#x27;s cabinet approved the National Plan of Action for Children in 1999 to ensure rights and improved upbringing.

Hasina attended the World Micro Credit summit in Washington DC; the World Food Summit in Rome; the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in India; the OIC summit in Pakistan; the 9th SAARC summit in the Maldives; the first D-8 summit in Turkey; the 5th World Conference for the Aged in Germany; the Commonwealth summit in the UK and the OIC summit in Iran. Hasina also visited the United States, Saudi Arabia, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Bangladesh joined two multilateral bodies, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation (D-8). She became the first Bangladeshi prime minister since independence to complete an entire five-year term.

In the 2001 general election, despite winning 40% of the popular vote (slightly less than BNP&#x27;s 41%), the AL won just 62 seats in parliament as a result of the first past-the-post electoral system, while the &#x27;Four Party Alliance&#x27; led by BNP won 234 seats, giving them a two-thirds majority in parliament. Hasina herself ran in three constituencies, and was defeated in a constituency in Rangpur, which included her husband&#x27;s hometown, but won in two other seats. Hasina and the AL rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the assistance of the president and the caretaker government. The international community was largely satisfied with the elections, and the &#x27;Four Party Alliance&#x27; went on to form a government.

==Leader of the Opposition (2001–2008)==
The Awami League MPs were irregular in attending parliament during the following period. In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary Abdul Jolil that the government would fall before 30 April 2004.

===Assassination attempt (2004)===

During her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. MP Ahsanullah Master died after he was shot in May 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 24 party supporters, including Ivy Rahman, party women&#x27;s secretary. In October 2018, a special court gave verdicts in two cases filed over the incident; the court ruled that it was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power, and all the accused, including BNP Senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman (in absentia) and former top intelligence officials, were found guilty. The court prescribed various punishments. However, on 1 December 2024, Tarique Rahman and few others was acquitted by the high court in this case. SAMS Kibria, Hasina&#x27;s close advisor and former finance minister was assassinated that year (2004) in a grenade attack in Sylhet.

In June 2005, A. B. M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury, the incumbent AL Mayor, won an important election in Chittagong, the second-largest city in Bangladesh. This election was seen as a showdown between the opposition and the ruling party.

=== Logi Boitha Movement ===

In October 2006, Sheikh Hasina and Awami League launched the Logi Boitha Movement where thousands of Awami League workers started occupying different streets of Dhaka with boathooks and Oars for several days. This resulted in a number of casualties, vandalisms, lootings as well as soaring prices of daily commodities.

In May 2007, the police filed chargesheet against 19 leaders and activists of the Awami League and its affiliates for vandalising, setting fire to and looting the office of the Islamic Social Welfare Council but all of them were acquitted in court in June 2011.

===Detention during military intervention (2006–2008)===
The months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia&#x27;s government in October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the Caretaker Government. The caretaker government had difficulty bringing all parties to the table. The AL and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favoured the BNP.

The interim period was marred with violence and strikes. Presidential Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury negotiated with Hasina and Khaleda Zia and brought all the parties to the planned 22 January 2007 parliamentary elections. Later the nomination of Ershad was cancelled by the returning officer of the Election Commission as Ershad had been convicted on a corruption case. As a result, the Grand Alliance withdrew its candidates en masse on the last day possible. They demanded that a voters&#x27; roll be published.

Later in the month, President Iajuddin Ahmed was compelled to declare a state of emergency. Consequently, Lt General Moeen Uddin Ahmed took control of the government. Political activity was prohibited. Fakhruddin Ahmed became the chief advisor with the support of the Bangladesh Army.

Hasina went to the United States embassy on 14 March 2007 along with Kazi Zafarullah and Tareq Ahmed Siddique. She would fly the next day to the United States accompanied by Tareq Ahmed Siddique and Abdus Sobhan Golap. She visited her son and daughter who live in the United States. She then moved to the United Kingdom.

In April 2007, Hasina was charged with graft and extortion by the military-backed caretaker government during the 2006–2008 political crisis. She was accused of having forced businessman Tajul Islam Farooq to pay bribes in 1998 before his company could build a power plant. Farooq said that he paid Hasina for approving his project.

On 18 April 2007, the Government barred Hasina from returning, stating that she had made provocative statements and that her return could cause disorder. This was described as a temporary measure. The Caretaker Government had also been trying to get Khaleda Zia to leave the country. Hasina vowed to return home, and on 22 April 2007, a warrant was issued for her arrest for murder. Describing the case against her as &quot;totally false and fake&quot;, Hasina said that she wanted to defend herself against the charges in court. On 23 April 2007, the arrest warrant was suspended, and on 25 April 2007, the ban on Hasina&#x27;s entry was dropped. After spending 51 days in the United States and the United Kingdom, on 7 May 2007 Hasina returned to Dhaka, where she was greeted by a crowd of several thousand. She told reporters that the government should not have delayed her return.

On 16 July 2007, Hasina was arrested by police at her home and taken before a local court in Dhaka. She was accused of extortion and denied bail and was held in a building converted into jail on the premises of the National Parliament. The AL said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets within one week. Hasina&#x27;s son Sajeeb Wazed was out of the country and said he would try to organise a worldwide protest. These arrests of the political leaders were widely seen as a move by the military-backed interim government to force Hasina and Zia out of the country and into political exile. United Kingdom MPs condemned the arrest.

On 11 April 2007, the police filed murder charges against Hasina, alleging that she masterminded the killing in October 2006 of four supporters of a rival political party. The four alleged victims were beaten to death during clashes between the AL and rival party activists. Hasina was visiting the United States at the time.

On 30 July 2007, the High Court suspended Hasina&#x27;s extortion trial and ordered her release on bail. On 2 September 2007, an additional case was filed against Hasina by the Anti-Corruption Commission regarding the awarding of a contract for the construction of a power plant in 1997, for which she allegedly took a bribe of 30 million takas and kept the contract from going to the lowest bidder. Six others were also accused of involvement. A graft case was filed against Zia on the same day.

On 13 January 2008, Hasina was indicted on extortion charges by a special court along with two of her relatives, her sister Sheikh Rehana and her cousin Sheikh Selim. On 6 February, the High Court stopped the trial, ruling that she could not be prosecuted under emergency laws for crimes alleged to have been committed prior to the imposition of the state of emergency.

On 11 June 2008, Hasina was released on parole for medical reasons. The next day she flew to the United States to be treated for hearing impairment, eye problems and high blood pressure. Syed Modasser Ali, her personal physician, threatened to sue the caretaker government over negligence regarding Hasina&#x27;s treatment during her detention.

The caretaker government held mayoral elections in which AL won 12 out of 13 elections. The government extended her two-month medical parole by one more month.

==Second premiership (2009–2024)==
===Second term (2009–2014)===

On 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to contest the 2008 general election scheduled for 29 December. She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the banner of the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party&#x27;s election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a &quot;Digital Bangladesh&quot; by 2021.

The AL manifesto was entitled &quot;A Charter for Change&quot; and included the party&#x27;s commitment to Vision 2021. The manifesto included pledges to implement measures to reduce price hikes; combat corruption by strengthening the independent ACC and submission of annual wealth statements by influential people; introduction of a long-term policy towards power and energy increasing power generation to 7,000 megawatts by 2013; bringing vibrancy to the agriculture sector and extending the safety net to the poor; creating good governance and curtailing terrorism and religious extremism; prosecution of 1971 war criminals; ensuring an independent and impartial judiciary; reforming the electoral system; strengthening the Human Rights Commission and de-politicising the administration.

Her Awami League and the Grand Alliance (a total of 14 parties) won the 2008 general election with a two-thirds majority, having won 230 out of 299 seats. Khaleda Zia, leader of the BNP-led coalition (4-Party Alliance), rejected the results of the election by accusing the Chief Election Commissioner of &quot;stage-managing the parliamentary election&quot;. Hasina was sworn into office as prime minister for a second term on 6 January 2009. Independent observers declared that the elections were held in a festive and peaceful atmosphere.

After being elected prime minister, Hasina reneged on her agreement with the Jatiya Party to make Ershad, its leader, the president.

Hasina removed Awami League central committee members who supported reforms forced by the previous caretaker government. She had to confront a major national crisis in the form of the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles revolt over a pay dispute, which resulted in 56 deaths, including Bangladesh Army officers. Hasina was blamed by the army officers due to her refusal to intervene against the revolt. However, In 2009, a recording emerged of Hasina&#x27;s private meeting with army officers, who expressed their anger with how she had not reacted more decisively in the revolt&#x27;s early stages, by ordering an armed raid of the BDR Rifles compound; they believed that her efforts to appease the revolt&#x27;s leaders delayed needed action which led to more deaths. In a 2011 &quot;The Daily Star&quot; editorial, she was commended for &quot;her sagacious handling of the situation which resulted in the prevention of a further bloodbath&quot;. In 2011, the parliament removed the law that required non-party caretaker government hold elections. In 2012, she maintained a hard-line stance and refused to allow entry to Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar during the 2012 Rakhine State riots.

On 27 June 2013, a case against Hasina and 24 other Bangladeshi Ministers and security personnel was lodged at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the alleged violation of human rights. She has been &quot;credited internationally&quot; for the achievement of some of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2012 a coup attempt against her by mid-ranking army officers was stopped, with the Bangladesh Army being tipped off by an Indian intelligence agency. The Bangladesh Army described the army officers involved as being Islamist extremists.

In 2012, she had a falling out with Muhammad Yunus, Nobel laureate and founder of Grameen Bank, following a Norwegian documentary that was critical of Yunus&#x27;s transferring of money from Grameen Bank to an affiliate organisation. Yunus transferred the money back after the documentary aired but it increased scrutiny of the bank by the government and media in Bangladesh. Yunus lost control of his bank following a court verdict. He criticised Hasina and other Bangladeshi politicians. She responded by saying she did not understand why Yunus blamed her when it was a court verdict that removed him from Grameen Bank.

During this term, her government led and succeeded in forming the International Crimes Tribunal, to investigate and prosecute suspects involved in the Bangladesh Genocide, committed by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators, Razakars, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

===Third term (2014–2019)===

Hasina secured a second-consecutive term in office with her ruling Awami League and its Grand Alliance allies, winning the 2014 general election by a landslide. The election was boycotted by leading opposition parties due to unfair conditions and a lack of non-partisan administration to conduct elections. As a result, the AL-led Grand Alliance won 267 seats out of which 153 were uncontested, surpassing its 2008 poll success—when it secured 263 parliamentary seats. Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009 and won 288 seats in this election. One of the leading opposition parties accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. The election was boycotted by major opposition parties including the BNP.

The election was controversial, with reports of violence and an alleged crackdown on the opposition in the run-up to the election. In the election 153 seats (of 300) went uncontested, of which the Awami League won 127 by default. Hasina&#x27;s Awami League won a safe parliamentary majority with a total of 234 seats. As a result of the boycott and violence, voter turnout was lower than the previous few elections at only 51%. The day after the result, Hasina said that the boycott should &quot;not mean there will be a question of legitimacy. People participated in the poll and other parties participated.&quot; Despite the controversy Hasina went on to form a government with Ershad&#x27;s Jatiya Party (who won 34 seats) as the official opposition.

The BNP wanted the elections to be held under a neutral caretaker government and had hoped to use protests to force the government to do so.

The period also saw increasing attacks by Islamic extremists in the country, including the July 2016 Dhaka attack which has been described as &quot;deadliest Islamist attack in Bangladeshi history&quot; by BBC. According to experts, the Hasina-led government&#x27;s repression of political opposition as well as shrinking democratic and civic space has created &quot;the space for extremist groups to flourish&quot; and &quot;has generated a violent backlash from Islamist groups.&quot;

In March 2017, Bangladesh&#x27;s first two submarines were commissioned. In September 2017, Hasina&#x27;s government granted refuge and aid to around a million Rohingya refugees and urged Myanmar to end violence against the Rohingya community. The majority of the Bangladeshi people supported the government&#x27;s decision to provide refugee status to the Rohingya. Hasina received credit and praise for her actions.

Hasina supported calls to remove the Statue of Justice in front of the Supreme Court. This was seen as the government bowing down to the pressure of those who use religion for political ends.

Hasina is a patron of the Asian University for Women, led by Chancellor Cherie Blair, and including the First Lady of Japan, Akie Abe, as well as Irina Bokova, the Director-General of UNESCO.

===Fourth term (2019–2024)===
Hasina won her third consecutive term, her fourth overall, when her Awami League won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats. The leader of the main opposition alliance, Kamal Hossain, declared the vote &quot;farcical&quot; and rejected the results. Before the election, Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations had accused the government of creating an intimidating environment for the Opposition. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial board described the election as farcical, the editorial stated that it was likely Hasina would have won without vote-rigging and questioned why she did so.

The BNP, the main opposition party that has been out of power for 12 years and boycotted the 2014 general election, fared extremely poorly. Winning only eight seats, the party and its Jatiya Oikya Front alliance have been marginalised to the weakest opposition ever since Bangladesh&#x27;s post-Ershad democratic restoration in 1991.
In May 2021, Hasina provided the inaugural address for the opening of a new headquarters for the Bangladesh Post Office, named the Dak Bhaban. In her address, Hasina urged for further development of the postal service in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Developmental measures outlined in the address include continuing the service&#x27;s digital transformation, and the construction of cooling units in postal warehouses to pave the way for the sending of perishable food by mail.

In January 2022, the government passed a law in the Jatiya Sangsad establishing the Universal Pension Scheme. All Bangladeshi citizens, including expatriates, between 18 and 60 years old are eligible to receive a monthly stipend under the scheme.

By the end of fiscal year 2021–22, Bangladesh&#x27;s external debt reached $95.86 billion, a 238% increase from 2011. The period is also marked by massive irregularities in the banking sector of the country where the amount of default loans went from less than in 2009 to more than in 2019 according to IMF.

In July 2022, the Finance Ministry requested fiscal assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The government cited depleting foreign-exchange reserves as a result of the sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A staff level agreement was reached in November 2022 and in January 2023, the IMF agreed to supply a support programme totalling US$4.7 billion, consisting of US$3.3 billion under the Extended Credit Facility and US$1.4 billion under the new Resilience and Sustainability Facility. The IMF stated support package &quot;will help preserve macroeconomic stability, protect the vulnerable and foster inclusive and green growth.&quot;

In December 2022, anti-government protests broke out, linked to the rising costs, demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.

On 28 December, Hasina opened the first phase of Dhaka Metro Rail, the country&#x27;s first mass-rapid transit system from Uttara to Agargaon.

During the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, Hasina had a bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss diversifying India-Bangladesh cooperation, including areas like connectivity and commercial linkages. She was accompanied by her daughter Saima Wazed, who is a candidate for a WHO election. The summit also provided an opportunity for Hasina to meet other global leaders and strengthen Bangladesh&#x27;s bilateral ties.

===Fifth term (2024)===
In January 2024 Hasina won her fourth consecutive term when her party, the Awami League, won 224 of the 300 parliamentary seats amidst a low voter turnout in an election boycotted by the main opposition. She was inaugurated on 11 January.

In May 2024, Sheikh Hasina claimed that a &quot;white country&quot; was plotting to topple her government and claimed that she would be promised trouble-free elections in January if she allowed a &quot;white country&quot; to set up an airbase in Bangladesh. She also alleged that there was a conspiracy to create a Christian country on the lines of East Timor and Myanmar.

In June 2024, the prime minister Hasina had visited India. In July 2024, at the invitation of the premier of China Li Qiang, Sheikh Hasina paid an official visit to China. As she visited India a month ago, this visit to China is also seen as her attempt to seek opportunities to mediate between China and India.

In the same month of Hasina&#x27;s state visit to China, protests broke out in support of reforming the quota system. In response, Hasina stated in a press conference, 

Protesters interpreted this as her referring to them as Razakars and adopted the title in some of their slogans. The protests later turned violent, involving police, the armed forces, and members of the Awami League, Chhatra League, and Jubo League, resulting in over 2000+ deaths and more than 20,000 injuries. The government then shut down internet access for all non-essential purposes, conducted a massive crackdown on protestors with the help of the armed forces, and imposed a curfew that lasted five days. The Supreme Court agreed to reform the quota system, but the protesters then demanded justice for those killed during the demonstrations and an official apology from Hasina and the resignation of certain ministers they believed were responsible for inciting violence. On 3 August, the protest organisers issued a single demand and announced a non-cooperation movement, calling for the resignation of Hasina and her entire cabinet.

====Resignation and flight from Bangladesh====
Hasina resigned on 5 August 2024, as large crowds of demonstrators surrounded the prime minister&#x27;s residence. Her resignation was announced by General Waker-uz-Zaman, the Chief of the Army Staff. Later that day, Hasina fled to India in a chaotic departure, first by car, then by helicopter, and finally by plane. She left with no resignation speech.

Hasina reportedly flew in a Bangladesh Air Force Lockheed C-130 transport to Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, India, where she was received by the Indian national security advisor Ajit Doval along with other senior military officials. Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar told the Parliament, &quot;At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India.&quot; Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, initially said that she would not return to politics and planned to &quot;stay in Delhi for a little while&quot; before her next destination, but subsequently said on 7 August that she and the Awami League would remain active in the Bangladeshi political scene and that she would return to the country once elections were declared. He also insisted that Sheikh Hasina was still the prime minister, saying that she was unable to formally submit her resignation after being forced to flee from the protesters. Hasina had hoped to go to London, but the United Kingdom reportedly rebuffed initial overtures seeking political asylum. She reportedly considered seeking temporary residence in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, or Qatar. Because her nephew lives in Finland, that country was speculated as a possible destination. Although Sajeeb Wazed lives in the U.S., she is considered unlikely to seek asylum there, as the U.S. government criticized her rule in Bangladesh.

Hasina was living in a secret location in India under tight security as of August 2024. Sajeeb Wazed said that the protests which led to her resignation had support from a foreign intelligence agency, without naming any country. In a statement published in the Indian media on 11 August, she accused the United States of influencing her resignation, and previously accused the United States of conspiring to oust her in the Jatiya Sangsad. However, Wazed called the statement &quot;false and fabricated&quot; and said Hasina &quot;did not give any statement before or after leaving Dhaka&quot;. The White House also denied allegations of any US involvement. On 13 August, Hasina released her first confirmed statements since her overthrow published by Wazed Joy calling for an investigation into the killings made during the protests, while insisting that police and the Awami League were also victims of &quot;terrorist aggression&quot;.

==Post-premiership==
As of 10 September 2024, Hasina is facing 152 cases which include 135 for murder, 7 for crimes against humanity and genocide, 3 for abduction, 6 for attempted murder and 1 for the attack on a BNP procession. These cases include other former government officials - Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Transport and Bridges Minister and concurrent Awami League secretary-general Obaidul Quader, and others. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal opened an investigation on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against her and nine senior government and Awami League officials over their role in the crackdown on the protests following a petition by the father of a killed student. The BNP requested India to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh for prosecution against the cases registered on her.

On 21 August, the Yunus interim government ordered the revocation of all diplomatic passports including Hasina&#x27;s. On 29 August, the interim government issued an ordinance revoking a law providing special privileges to the Sheikh–Wazed family, including Sheikh Hasina, under which it was enacted in 2009. On 17 October, the International Crimes Tribunal issued an arrest warrant against her for alleged &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; committed during the July massacre. On 5 December, the tribunal banned her speeches and related broadcasts from being published in Bangladesh.

In December 2024, the Bangladeshi government opened an investigation against Hasina, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, and her niece, Tulip Siddiq, who is an MP and was then a cabinet minister in the United Kingdom, over allegations of embezzlement of $5 million in funds for the construction of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant using offshore accounts in Malaysia. On 24 December, the Bangladeshi government formally requested the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to extradite Hasina.

== Electoral history ==


== Reception ==
The Padma Bridge graft scandal involved the ruling Awami League government that allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount of money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin. The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and a Canadian court subsequently dismissed the case.

As a result of the allegations, the World Bank pulled out of a project to provide funding for the Padma Bridge, citing corruption concerns, cancelling of credit for the road-rail bridge over the Padma River. One of the individuals implicated was Minister of Communications Syed Abul Hossain who subsequently resigned and was later acquitted of any wrongdoing. On 11 July 2012, BNP General-Secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the Awami League government should make public a letter sent by the World Bank, wherein the Bank brought graft charges against Hasina and three other figures. On 17 January 2016, Hasina stated that a managing director of a bank in the United States provoked the World Bank to cancel the loan. The bridge was eventually constructed with the government&#x27;s own funds and was inaugurated in June 2022 at a cost of , much higher than the original projected cost of .

On 24 January 2017, in a speech in parliament, Prime Minister Hasina blamed Muhammad Yunus for the World Bank&#x27;s pulling out of the project. According to her, Yunus lobbied with the former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to persuade the World Bank to terminate the loan. On 10 February 2017, a justice of the Superior Court of Ontario dismissed the bribery-conspiracy case for lack of any evidence.

In 2018, Hasina&#x27;s government passed the controversial Digital Security Act, 2018, under which any criticism deemed inappropriate by the government over the internet or any other media could be punished by prison terms of various degrees. This was heavily criticised both domestically and internationally for suppressing people&#x27;s freedom of speech, as well as undermining press freedom in Bangladesh.

In December 2022, the Hasina government ordered the closure of 191 websites accused of publishing &quot;anti-state news&quot; citing intelligence reports. Dhaka district authorities ordered the closure of &quot;Dainik Dinkal&quot;, which is owned by Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). &quot;Dainik Dinkal&quot; appealed the order to the Bangladesh Press Council who dismissed their appeal in February 2022, resulting in its closure. The move has been criticised by government opponents who claim the move is an attempt to stifle opposition to the government. The government claimed &quot;Dainik Dinkal&quot; violated articles 10, 11, 16, 21(1)(kha) of the Printing Presses and Publications (Declaration and Registration) Act, 1973 as it had irregular publication and its publisher was a convicted felon.

In June 2024, Sheikh Hasina paid a state visit to New Delhi, during which Bangladesh and India signed ten bilateral agreements, including one on allowing India a rail corridor to its northeastern states through Bangladeshi territory. This led to widespread criticism in Bangladesh on the issue of the country&#x27;s sovereignty, accusing Hasina of &quot;selling the country to India&quot;.

Domestically, Hasina has been criticised as being too close to India, often at the cost of Bangladesh&#x27;s sovereignty. She is seen by her critics as a manifestation of India&#x27;s interference in Bangladeshi politics, which they have described as the main source of her power.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Hasina married M. A. Wazed Miah (1942–2009), a Bangladeshi physicist, writer, and chairman of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. They have a son, Sajeeb Wazed, and a daughter, Saima Wazed. Saima&#x27;s father-in-law is a former minister of Expatriates&#x27; Welfare and Overseas Employment and LGRD, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain. Hasina&#x27;s only living sibling, Sheikh Rehana, served as the adviser of Tungipara upazila unit Awami League in Gopalganj in 2017. Hasina&#x27;s niece (and Sheikh Rehana&#x27;s daughter) is Tulip Siddiq, a British Labour Party politician and elected Member of Parliament and City Minister.

During her political career, Sheikh Hasina has survived a total of 19 assassination attempts. She suffers from a hearing impairment as a result of injuries sustained during the 2004 grenade attack. Given the violent history of brutal assassination of Sheikh Mujib family in 1975, and later attempts to assassinate Sheikh Hasina and very high security risk towards the immediate Mujib family members, in 2015, she and her children were given lifelong protection by the government of Bangladesh through the Special Security Force. Practice of extending such security protection is not rare for persons with high security risk to their lives. The government also announced free utility for life for her and her family. However, the interim government decided to cancel this law. Then on 9 September 2024, an ordinance was issued repealing this law.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and family===
Cox is divorced from both his first wife, Lilian Monroe-Carr, and his second wife, Caroline Burt. Cox and Burt have two children, Margaret and Alan; the latter is also an actor, best known for his roles in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes,&quot; and as the young John Mortimer in the television film of his play &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; (1982) opposite Laurence Olivier. Cox married his third wife, actress Nicole Ansari, in 2002. They have two sons, Orson Jonathan Cox and Torin Kamran Cox, and lived in New York City.

===Political and other views===
Cox is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and a Scottish republican. In 2007, he campaigned for the Scottish Labour Party in the run-up to that year&#x27;s Scottish Parliament election. Cox endorsed the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the 2011 Parliament election because of their higher education policy. In 2020, Cox told former Labour Party strategist Alastair Campbell that he was an active and committed Labour supporter all his life until the party&#x27;s controversial decision under Tony Blair&#x27;s premiership to involve the UK in the Iraq War. On 25 May 2012, he spoke in support of Scottish independence at the Yes Scotland campaign, saying he had gradually become disillusioned by New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, although Cox could not vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum due to his residence in the United States. On 29 January 2015, Cox announced he had quit Labour, believing it had failed to live up to its basic principles in recent years, and joined the SNP, whom he felt was taking forward values of social justice and representing Scotland&#x27;s best interests.

In January 2020, Cox called for a second referendum on Scottish independence, saying Labour had &quot;failed&quot; in Scotland and that the Scottish people were &quot;organically&quot; moving towards a decision to leave the UK following Brexit. In October 2020, he acknowledged that he was unlikely to ever return to living in Scotland, citing the weather. In November 2022, Cox insisted that he did not consider himself a Scottish nationalist and described himself as an Anglophile, but believed too many political decisions were being made on Scotland&#x27;s behalf. Cox also said he favoured a move towards federalism and constitutional change in the United Kingdom over Scottish independence, commenting, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to break up the Union but I want another idea for the Union&quot;, which he described as &quot;independent states but we come together as a united federation&quot;.

In October 2022, Cox criticised Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss in the wake of the September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget. Cox asserted the Conservatives had &quot;no vision&quot; and that he did not believe Truss &quot;is the right person for the job&quot;.

During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Cox signed his name in support of &quot;A Letter Against Apartheid&quot; written by six Palestinian artists. After the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023, Cox signed another letter (Artists4Ceasefire) calling for a ceasefire. He later recorded himself reading the poem &quot;If I Must Die&quot; by Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian writer and professor killed by an Israeli airstrike during the war.

Cox revealed in an interview to &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he supported the recreational use of cannabis: &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone—get stoned!&quot;

==Honours and other recognition ==
On 31 December 2002, Cox was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List.

He was honoured at the 2004 BAFTA Scotland Awards with an Outstanding Achievement Award, and at the 2004 Great Scot Awards with a Lifetime Achievement Award.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine awarded him the Empire Icon Award in 2006, and the UK Film Council named him one of the top 10 powerful British film stars in Hollywood in 2007.

In 1993, Cox was made an Honorary Doctor of Laws &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Dundee. In 2006, he was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Drama by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. In July 2007, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, and was made an Honorary Doctor of Drama by Napier University in Edinburgh in July 2008. In November 2011, he was named an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Kingston University in southwest London for his tireless contributions to drama education.

In February 2010, Cox was elected as the 12th Rector of the University of Dundee by its students, was formally installed in October, and was re-elected in January 2013.

In December 2018 he was appointed head of the international jury at the Golden Unicorn Awards. 
==Charity work==
Cox is a patron of the Scottish Youth Theatre, Scotland&#x27;s national theatre &quot;for and by&quot; young people. Scottish Youth Theatre&#x27;s building in Glasgow, The Old Sheriff Court, named their theatre the Brian Cox Studio Theatre in his honour. He is also a patron of &quot;THE SPACE&quot;, a training facility for actors and dancers in his native Dundee, and an ambassador for the Screen Academy Scotland, a collaboration between Napier University and the Edinburgh College of Art. Cox is also patron of The Old Rep Theatre in Birmingham, one of the first repertory theatres to be built in the UK. In October 2017, he was made an honorary patron for Capital Theatre&#x27;s campaign to modernise the historic King&#x27;s Theatre Edinburgh and preserve it for future generations. In January 2020, he was removed from patronage of the Mid-Lin Daycare Centre, a centre for the elderly in Dundee, after serving for four years due to his confession of his use and endorsement of recreational cannabis. In April 2020, he became patron of the British American Drama Academy with whom he has had a decades-long association, including directing several collaborations with the Moscow Art Theatre and holding regular Masterclasses for participants on BADA&#x27;s programs.

In April 2010, Cox, along with Ian McKellen and Eleanor Bron, appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. In 2012, Cox became the Grand Marshal of the New York City Tartan Day Parade and reprised the role in 2020, the first time a previous Grand Marshal was asked to return since the parade moved to Manhattan&#x27;s Sixth Avenue. In June 2005, he was awarded the first Scotland&#x27;s Tartan Day International Ambassador Award at a ceremony in the Scottish Parliament for his work in promoting Scotland abroad.

==Bibliography==
He has authored three books: &quot;Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Lear Diaries&quot;, and his autobiography &quot;Putting the Rabbit in the Hat&quot;.

&quot;Salem to Moscow: An Actors Odyssey&quot; spans 30 years in British theatre, beginning in the 1980s, when Cox, despite success on both sides of the Atlantic, was looking for a new sense of purpose for his life and work which culminates having first directed &quot;The Crucible&quot; at the Moscow Art Theatre School.

In &quot;The Lear Diaries&quot;, Cox accounts how a group of leading actors approach a major text, providing insight into the pressures that contemporary theatre actors face. He describes the emotional and physical difficulties that came with playing King Lear while also working as a member of an ensemble playing roles in Richard III. His diary also reveals the personal strains of touring, particularly the difficulties of being separated from his family during the company&#x27;s year-long tour.

Cox credits a remark from fellow actor Oliver Cotton during the production as resulting in the title of his autobiography &quot;Putting The Rabbit In The Hat&quot; published in 2021.

<text>The Bonn Agreement is a European environmental agreement.

Following several oil spills in 1969, the coastal nations of the North Sea formed the Bonn Agreement to ensure mutual cooperation in the avoidance and combating of environmental pollution.

The agreement was revised in 1983 to include the European Union and again in 2001 to allow Ireland to join.

Members of the Bonn Agreement are Belgium, Denmark, the European Community, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and Spain.

<doc id="623452" wikidata="Q722682" url="?curid=623452" title="Hannibal (2001 film)">
<text>Hannibal is a 2001 American horror film directed by Ridley Scott, based on the 1999 novel by Thomas Harris. A sequel to the 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the plot follows disgraced FBI special agent Clarice Starling as she attempts to apprehend the cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures him. Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Lecter, while Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as Starling and Gary Oldman plays Verger. Ray Liotta, Frankie R. Faison, Giancarlo Giannini, and Francesca Neri also star.

Harris published &quot;Hannibal&quot; eleven years after the publication of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1988). Scott became attached while directing &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), and signed on after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who had produced &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), the first Lecter film. David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay, and principal photography commenced in May 2000, lasting sixteen weeks.

&quot;Hannibal&quot; was released on 9 February 2001 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States and internationally by Universal Pictures, ten years after &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It was highly anticipated and broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, and grossed $351.6 million during its theatrical run, becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2001, but received mixed reviews; critics praised the performances and visuals, but deemed it inferior to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and criticized its violence. It was followed by a prequel, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, in 2002, with Hopkins reprising his role as Lecter and Brett Ratner taking over as director. 
==Plot==
10 years after the death of serial killer Jame Gumb and the escape of cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter, FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is blamed for a botched drug raid that resulted in five deaths. This attracts the attention of Mason Verger, Lecter&#x27;s only surviving victim. A wealthy child molester, Verger was paralyzed and disfigured by Lecter and has been scheming to torture and kill him ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter&#x27;s case, hoping her involvement will draw out Lecter from hiding. He is aided by corrupt Justice Department official Paul Krendler, who is upset that Starling refused to sleep with him.

After learning of Starling&#x27;s disgrace, Lecter sends her a letter; he is hiding in Florence under the false identity of library curator &quot;Dr. Fell.&quot; A perfume expert identifies the fragrance on the letter: skin cream with unusual ingredients available in only a few shops. Krendler sexually propositions Starling again, implying that he can save her career, but she rebuffs him.

Florentine policeman Rinaldo Pazzi questions Lecter about the death of Dr. Fell&#x27;s predecessor. When Starling asks Pazzi for a local fragrance shop&#x27;s security footage, Pazzi realizes Dr. Fell is Lecter. To claim Verger&#x27;s $3 million bounty for Lecter, Pazzi agrees to help Verger&#x27;s men kidnap Lecter without police involvement. However, Lecter subdues Pazzi and forces him to confess. Lecter then disembowels Pazzi and hangs him from the balcony of the Palazzo Vecchio.

Verger bribes Krendler to frame Starling for hiding evidence against Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter summons Starling to Washington Union Station, where he encourages her to quit her job. However, Verger&#x27;s men trail Starling and capture Lecter.

Starling infiltrates Verger&#x27;s estate, where she learns that Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of purpose-bred wild boars. She frees Lecter from the boar pen but a guard shoots her. The boars devour the guards but ignore Lecter. Verger orders Cordell, his physician, to shoot Lecter, but Lecter offers to take the blame if Cordell kills Verger instead. Cordell, who dislikes Verger, shoves him into the pen, where the boars eat him alive. Lecter carries an unconscious Starling to safety.

Starling awakens in Krendler&#x27;s home, wearing an unfamiliar cocktail dress. Although Lecter has sedated her and Krendler, she remembers to call the police. She then finds Lecter preparing an elegant dinner, during which Krendler lobs misogynistic insults at her. He then insults Lecter&#x27;s cooking. Lecter opens Krendler&#x27;s skull, removes part of his brain, sautées it, and feeds it to Krendler. Although Lecter hopes to impress Starling by torturing her oppressor, she is horrified.

Starling attacks Lecter, but he overpowers and kisses her. She handcuffs their wrists together. Hearing the police arrive, Lecter raises a cleaver over her wrist. The film cuts to Starling raising both hands to meet the police.

On a flight, Lecter, his arm in a sling, shares Krendler&#x27;s brain with a curious boy, saying it is important to &quot;try new things.”

==Development==
&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, based on the 1988 novel by Thomas Harris, was released in 1991 to critical and commercial success, winning five Academy Awards. Harris spent several years writing a sequel novel; &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; director Jonathan Demme expressed interest in developing a film adaptation when the novel was complete.

The film rights to the Lecter character were owned by producer couple Dino De Laurentiis and Martha De Laurentiis. After producing the first Lecter film, &quot;Manhunter,&quot; in 1986, they allowed Orion Pictures to produce &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; free without their involvement. When &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; became a success, the couple became eager for a new Lecter novel they could adapt. After a lengthy wait, De Laurentiis received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the novel and De Laurentiis purchased the rights for a record $10 million.

In April 1999, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the budget for an adaptation of &quot;Hannibal&quot; could cost as much as $100 million. It speculated that both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would receive $15 million each to reprise their roles and that Demme would receive $5 million to $19 million. Mort Janklow, Harris&#x27;s agent at the time, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Foster, Hopkins, and Demme would soon receive manuscripts of the novel, claiming it would make an unbelievable film. The novel sold out of its initial 1.6 million print run in 1999, and went on to sell millions of copies.

Demme declined the invitation to direct, as he reportedly found the material lurid and too gory. In the 2010 Biography Channel documentary &quot;Inside Story: The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Demme said: &quot;Tom Harris, as unpredictable as ever, took Clarice and Dr. Lecter&#x27;s relationship in a direction that just didn&#x27;t compute for me. And Clarice is drugged up, and she&#x27;s eating brains with him, and I just thought, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do this.&#x27;&quot; De Laurentiis said of Demme&#x27;s decision to decline: &quot;When the pope dies, we create a new pope. Good luck to Jonathan Demme. Good-bye.&quot; He later said that Demme felt he could not make a sequel as good as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

===Ridley Scott===
De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott on the set of &quot;Gladiator&quot; and suggested he direct &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Scott, who was conducting principal photography on &quot;Gladiator,&quot; thought De Laurentiis was speaking about the Carthaginian general and replied: &quot;Dino, I&#x27;m doing a Roman epic right now. I don&#x27;t wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy.&quot;

Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, seeing it as a &quot;symphony&quot;, and expressed his desire to direct. He said: &quot;I haven&#x27;t read anything so fast since &quot;The Godfather&quot;. It was so rich in all kinds of ways.&quot; Scott had reservations with the ending of the novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s been in the back of his mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is.&quot; He also did not find the book believable after the opera scene, &quot;which became like a vampire movie&quot;. Harris gave Scott permission to change the ending.

===Writing===
Ted Tally, screenwriter for &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, was another key member of the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; team to decline involvement. Tally, like Demme, had problems with the novel&#x27;s &quot;excesses&quot;. David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures, said: &quot;There&#x27;s no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available to work on the script day-to-day.&quot; A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as &quot;stunningly bad&quot; but found Zaillian&#x27;s rewrite &quot;gripping entertainment&quot;. Scott praised Mamet as fast and efficient, but said he passed on his draft because it needed work and he feared Mamet, who was soon directing his own film, would be too busy to redraft it.

Steven Zaillian, writer of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, initially declined to write &quot;Hannibal&quot;, saying he was busy and that &quot;you can almost never win when you do a sequel&quot;. He changed his mind, as &quot;it&#x27;s hard to say no to Dino once and it&#x27;s almost impossible to say no to him twice&quot;. Scott said there were &quot;very few rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian ... If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed &quot;Hannibal&quot; endlessly.&quot; One of Zaillian&#x27;s key objectives was to revise Mamet&#x27;s script until it pleased all parties, meaning that the &quot;love story&quot; would be told by suggestion instead of by &quot;assault&quot;. Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days, making him &quot;sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him&quot;. After 25 days, Scott realized that Zaillian was &quot;exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do ... Frankly I could have just made it.&quot;

===Casting===
It was unclear if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their respective roles for which they won Academy Awards in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (Best Actress/Best Actor). Both Hopkins and Foster had expressed interest. It became apparent that the producers and the studio could do without one of the original &quot;stars&quot; and would go on to find a replacement. The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film&#x27;s release: &quot;First and foremost, I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins.&quot;

====Involvement of Jodie Foster====
Foster told Larry King in 1997 that she &quot;would definitely be part of&quot; a sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. In the same year, she told &quot;Entertainment Weekly:&quot; &quot;Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it&#x27;s like: &#x27;When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen?&#x27;&quot; De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, and believed the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a &quot;hunch&quot; she would not be.

Foster confirmed that she had turned down the film in December 1999. This caused problems for Universal and production partner Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). &quot;The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment,&quot; said Kevin Misher, Universal&#x27;s President of Production. Misher added that, &quot;It was one of those moments when you sit down and think, &#x27;Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?&#x27; Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?&quot; Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in &quot;Hannibal&quot; had &quot;negative attributes&quot; and &quot;betrayed&quot; the original character.

Foster&#x27;s spokeswoman said she declined because Claire Danes had become available for Foster&#x27;s film &quot;Flora Plum&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the &quot;Hannibal&quot; project as having become &quot;a bloody mess, hemorrhaging talent and money&quot; despite Hopkins being on board. In 2005, after the film had been released, Foster told &quot;Total Film&quot;: &quot;The official reason I didn&#x27;t do &quot;Hannibal&quot; is I was doing another movie, &quot;Flora Plum&quot;. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn&#x27;t available when that movie was being shot ... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say but there was no way that either of us could really trample on her.&quot;

====Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling====
When it became clear that Foster would skip &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the production team considered several different actresses, including Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd, Helen Hunt and Julianne Moore. Hopkins asked his agent if he had any &quot;power&quot; over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on &quot;Surviving Picasso&quot;, and thought her a &quot;terrific actress&quot;. Although Hopkins&#x27; agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins&#x27; &quot;leading lady&quot;. Scott said he was &quot;really surprised to find that [he] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it.&quot; In order to star in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Moore would decline to play a role in &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.

Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore: &quot;She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, a vamp in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, a porn star in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and a romantic in &quot;The End of the Affair&quot;.&quot; &quot;Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list,&quot; said Scott on his female lead. Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: &quot;The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster&#x27;s ... but this film is going to be very different.&quot;

====Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter====

Hopkins was generally expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins said in June 1999 that he would only be interested if the script was &quot;really good&quot;. Hopkins said he could not make up his mind to commit: &quot;I was kind of surprised by this book, &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn&#x27;t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about.&quot; When the producers confirmed that they were going to film Harris&#x27; novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: &quot;It needs some condensing.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; confirmed that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest draft of the script.

Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into &quot;Lecter&#x27;s mind&quot;. &quot;I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, &#x27;Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?&#x27; Ten years had passed so I changed a bit.&quot; In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins said: &quot;It&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s making a statement—&#x27;catch me if you can&#x27;. With his big hat, he&#x27;s so obvious that nobody thinks he&#x27;s Hannibal Lecter. I&#x27;ve always thought he&#x27;s a very elegant man, a Renaissance man.&quot; In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence &quot;as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth&quot;, according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the US, Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short &quot;to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got ... in his way&quot;.

====Gary Oldman as Mason Verger====
The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter&#x27;s two surviving victims, was originally offered to Christopher Reeve based on his work as a police officer who uses a wheelchair in &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a &quot;funny situation&quot; with Oldman wanting a prominent &quot;credit&quot;. She said: &quot;Now how can you have a prominent credit with &quot;Hannibal&quot;? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn&#x27;t work something out (at first).&quot; Oldman was apparently &quot;out&quot; of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go &quot;unbilled&quot;. Oldman would become transformed and &quot;unrecognizable as himself&quot; to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: &quot;It&#x27;s really disgusting ... I&#x27;ve been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say &#x27;Oh my God,&#x27; and walk away, which makes me very happy.&quot; Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to &quot;do it anonymously&quot; under the heavy make-up.

====Further casting====
Other stars subsequently cast included Ray Liotta as U.S. Justice Department official Paul Krendler (the character had appeared in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but original actor Ron Vawter had died in the interim) and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini as Detective Rinaldo Pazzi. Francesca Neri played Pazzi&#x27;s wife, Allegra. Frankie Faison reprised his role as orderly Barney Matthews, remaining the only actor to play a role in all &quot;Lecter&quot; feature films (until &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; in 2007), including &quot;Manhunter&quot;.

===Key production crew===
Scott recruited the key production crew with whom he had worked previously. Production designer Norris Spencer had worked on &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot; and &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot;. Cinematographer John Mathieson, editor Pietro Scalia and composer Hans Zimmer had all worked on Scott&#x27;s previous film &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

==Production==
===Background===
&quot;Hannibal&quot; was filmed in 83 working days over 16 weeks. The film began production on 8 May 2000 in Florence, Italy. The film visited key locations in Florence and various locations around the United States. Martha De Laurentiis said the film has almost a hundred locations and that it was a &quot;constant pain of moving and dressing sets. But the locations were beautiful. Who could complain about being allowed to shoot in Palazzo Vecchio in Florence? Or President James Madison&#x27;s farm in Montpelier or the amazing Biltmore Estate in Asheville?&quot; Eighty million dollars and a year and a half in production were spent before Scott got his first look at &quot;Hannibal&quot; in the editing room.

===Filming locations===
* The whole second act of &quot;Hannibal&quot; takes place in Florence. Ridley Scott had never filmed there before, but described it as &quot;quite an experience ... It was kind of organized chaos ... We were there at the height of tourist season.&quot; Within Florence, the production would visit various locations such as the Palazzo Capponi (as Dr. Fell&#x27;s workplace), the Ponte Vecchio, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the Cathedral.
* After leaving Italy on 5 June 2000, the production moved to Washington, D.C. Filming took place over six days at Washington Union Station. The unusual sight of a carousel appeared in the transportation hub and shopping plaza at Ridley Scott&#x27;s request.
* Filming lasted for seven weeks in Richmond, Virginia for the shootout in a crowded fish market (shot at Richmond Farmer&#x27;s Market) early in the film. Julianne Moore underwent FBI training at the Bureau&#x27;s headquarters before filming.
* A barn in Orange, Virginia, situated on the estate of President James Madison, was used to house 15 &quot;performing hogs&quot;. The 15 Russian boars used in the shoot were from a selection of around 6,000 that the animal wranglers observed.
* Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, the biggest privately owned estate in the US, was chosen to signify the huge personal wealth of Mason Verger.

===Special make-up effects===
Make-up artist Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in &quot;Hannibal&quot; as it offered him the chance to produce &quot;incredible and original make-ups&quot;. For Mason Verger, the make-up team initially produced 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character. Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the &quot;House of Wax&quot;. Scott himself called on the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn&#x27;t lost his sense of humour, almost sympathetic. Oldman spent six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.

For one of the film&#x27;s final and infamous scenes, an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler, played by Ray Liotta, a scene which blended make-up, puppet work and CGI in a way which Scott called &quot;seamless&quot;.

===Title sequence===
The main titles were designed by Nick Livesey, a graduate of the Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott&#x27;s production companies in London. The sequence, shot in Florence by Livesey himself, was intended as the film&#x27;s second promotional trailer. The studio thought it not &quot;quite right&quot;, but it remained on Scott&#x27;s mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence. Livesey gathered footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter. Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: &#x27;Where is Hannibal Lecter?&#x27; Scott explains: &quot;And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you wonder where that is ... and there he is... his face appears.&quot; The titles are said to have been influenced by the film &quot;Seven&quot;.

==Music==
Ridley Scott worked very closely with composer Hans Zimmer, during post-production on &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Scott believes the music to a film is as important as dialogue—&quot;It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact.&quot; Zimmer, and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and &quot;not music&quot;.

The character Mason Verger had his own theme, which become more &quot;perverted&quot; as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante&#x27;s sonnet was put to music by Patrick Cassidy titled Vide cor Meum for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer&#x27;s score. &quot;Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans&#x27; full attention ... the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience.&quot; In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, &quot;Hannibal&quot; ranked at 59. Strauss&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; is also played at several points in the film.

==Themes==
===Romance===
Scott has said he believes the underlying emotion of &quot;Hannibal&quot; is &quot;affection&quot;. &quot;In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it&#x27;s kind of romantic at the same time.&quot; Scott openly admits to a &quot;romantic thematic&quot; running through the film. He told CNN that: &quot;&quot;Hannibal&quot; was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it&#x27;s rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there&#x27;s some quite bad behaviour as well.&quot; During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante&#x27;s sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, &quot;Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?&quot; Lecter replies: &quot;Yes, I believe he could ... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for &quot;him&quot;?&quot; This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people &quot;missed&quot; the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its review of the film, said &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;toys&quot; with the idea of &quot;love that dare not speak its name&quot;.

Composer Hans Zimmer believed there were messages and subtext in each scene. He said, &quot;I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance ...&quot; Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern-day &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. During post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about the meaning of Starling&#x27;s tear during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of &quot;anguish&quot;, &quot;loneliness&quot; or &quot;disgust&quot;. Scott told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is metaphorical. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said in their review, &quot;Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think &#x27;When Hannibal met Sally&#x27;.&quot;

===Retribution and punishment===
Scott has said he believed Lecter, in his own way, was &quot;pure&quot;, whose motivation is the search for &quot;retribution and punishment&quot;. &quot;There is something very moral about Lecter in this film,&quot; said Scott in his audio commentary. &quot;The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane—[I] didn&#x27;t want to use that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he&#x27;s as sane as you or I. He just likes it.&quot; Scott did say, however, &quot;In our normal terms, he&#x27;s truly evil.&quot; Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film&#x27;s end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.

===Corruption===
Part of the story involves the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns &quot;Dr. Fell&#x27;s&quot; true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate the death of a Romani pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as &quot;very thoughtful&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000, over nine months before the film&#x27;s release. As the film had only just begun production, footage was used from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. A second trailer, which featured footage from the new film, was released in late November 2000. In marketing the film, Hopkins&#x27; portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was chosen as the unique selling point of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. &quot;Mr Hopkins is the draw here&quot;, said Elvis Mitchell in a 2001 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article. A poster released in the UK to promote &quot;Hannibal&quot;, featuring Lecter with a &quot;skin mask&quot; covering the right side of his face, was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed &quot;too shocking and disturbing for the public.&quot;

Upon its release, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was met with significant media attention, with the film&#x27;s stars and director making several appearances on television, in newspapers and in magazines. In an article for CBS News, Jill Serjeant stated that &quot;the long-awaited sequel to the grisly 1991 thriller &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; is cooking up the hottest Internet and media buzz since the 1999 &quot;Star Wars&quot; &#x27;prequel&#x27;.&quot; Stars Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore made the covers of a number of magazines, including &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot;.

===Distribution===

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer distributed the film in the United States and Canada, while Universal Pictures International handled international sales, with United International Pictures distributing the film in certain international territories excluding Germany, Italy and Japan. Dino De Laurentiis Company retained the film through close deals, such as Tobis StudioCanal for Germany, Filmauro for Italy and GAGA Communications for Japan.

===Home media===
&quot;Hannibal&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on August 21, 2001, and on Blu-ray on September 15, 2009. A new transfer of the film was released on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray by Kino Lorber on May 7, 2019.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Hannibal&quot; grossed $58 million (U.S.) in its opening weekend from 3,230 screens. At the time, this was the third-biggest debut ever behind 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. It went on to surpass &quot;Scream 3&quot; to have the highest debut in February. That record was surpassed by &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; in 2004. The film also had the largest opening weekend for an R-rated film, beating &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. &quot;Hannibal&quot; would hold this record for two years until it was taken by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; in 2003. Furthermore, it managed to beat out the Special Edition release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; to have the highest winter opening weekend. Final domestic box office gross (U.S.) reached $165,092,268, with a worldwide gross of $351,692,268. The film spent three weeks at number one in the U.S. box office chart, and four weeks at number one in the UK, and was the year&#x27;s third highest-grossing film in that country behind &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. In Italy, it grossed $4.6 million in its opening weekend, setting a record for a US release, beating &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. It also set a record opening week in the Netherlands with $1.3 million in six days, beating &quot;Independence Day&quot;. It also had the second biggest opening in Spain with $4.1 million in 6 days. &quot;Hannibal&quot; was the tenth highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. &quot;Hannibal&quot; also made over $87,000,000 in U.S. video rentals following release in August 2001.

===Critical response===
The reviews for &quot;Hannibal&quot; were mixed-to-negative. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39% based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While superbly acted and stylishly filmed, &quot;Hannibal&quot; lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;A banquet of creepy, gory or grotesque incidents is on display in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it &quot;laughable to just plain boring, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is toothless to the end.&quot; David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, praised the film. &quot;It works. It&#x27;s smart, good-looking, sexy, fun ... dirty, naughty and knowing.&quot; Thomson does make clear he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott&#x27;s work. He adds: &quot;It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can&#x27;t be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That&#x27;s how the movie was saved.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in its review said &quot;&quot;Hannibal&quot; is not as good as &quot;Lambs&quot; ... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling.&quot;

A negative review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book: &quot;The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a marvelous thing. This, by contrast, is barely okey-dokey.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and described &quot;Hannibal&quot; as &quot;a carnival geek show elevated in the direction of art. It never quite gets there, but it tries with every fiber of its craft to redeem its pulp origins, and we must give it credit for the courage of its depravity,&quot; and although he was &quot;left with admiration for Scott&#x27;s craft in pulling [it] off at all, and making it watchable&quot;, and praised the Mason Verger character as &quot;a superb joining of skill and diabolical imagination,&quot; as well as Hopkins&#x27; performance as Lecter, which he described as &quot;fascinating every second he is on the screen,&quot; he concluded, &quot;I cannot approve of the movie, not because of its violence, which belongs to the Grand Guignol tradition, but because the underlying story lacks the fascination of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.&quot;

==Differences from the novel==
According to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, the script for &quot;Hannibal&quot; was: &quot;quite faithful to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger&#x27;s muscle-bound macho sister Margot, as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake).&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; noted: &quot;The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that&#x27;s enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time&#x27;s left for analysis or characterization.&quot; Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: &quot;I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren&#x27;t so vital.&quot;

In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. At the book&#x27;s end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger&#x27;s guards. Margot, at Lecter&#x27;s advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet moray eel down his throat.

The book&#x27;s controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father, which he &quot;brings to life&quot; by hypnotizing Starling, allowing her to say goodbye. This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter, culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to Argentina. At the novel&#x27;s end, Barney sees them at the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires.

Also gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter&#x27;s childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944. These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; (written concurrently with the 2006 novel of the same name) which portrays Lecter as a young man.

Hopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). &quot;Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there&#x27;s a moral issue there. I think it would have been a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of &quot;SotL&quot;, she said, &#x27;Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter ... &#x27;.&quot;

==Other media==
===Prequels===
The film was followed by two films which are prequels based on novels by Thomas Harris (although the novel of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; isn&#x27;t itself a prequel as it was written before &quot;Hannibal&quot;):

* &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; (2007)

===In popular culture===
In 2014, there was a news story from Italy where a gangster fed his rival alive to pigs. Many media stories compared this to a similar scene in &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

Five months after the film&#x27;s release, the renowned &quot;South Park&quot; episode Scott Tenorman Must Die featured Eric Cartman attempting to train a pony to bite his titular rival Scott Tenorman, directly citing &quot;the deformed guy&quot; from Hannibal for such a scheme.

<text>Toshimaru Nakamura is a Japanese musician, active in free improvisation and onkyokei.

He began his career playing rock and roll guitar, but gradually explored other types of music, even abandoning guitar, and started working on circuit bending. He uses a mixing console as a live, interactive musical instrument: &quot;Nakamura plays the &#x27;no-input mixing board&#x27;, connecting the input of the board to the output, then manipulating the resultant audio feedback.&quot;

Nakamura&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;sounds ranging from piercing high tones and shimmering whistles to galumphing, crackle-spattered bass patterns.&quot;

Nakamura founded the ensemble A Paragon of Beauty in 1992. He has recorded solo albums, worked as a session musician, and collaborated with artists including Sachiko M (&quot;a kindred spirit&quot;), Otomo Yoshihide, Keith Rowe, John Butcher, Espen Reinertsen, Nicholas Bussmann, Taku Sugimoto, Tetuzi Akiyama, dancer Kim Ito, and drummer Jason Kahn.

<text>The Others is an American science fiction television series created by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and produced by Delusional Films, NBC Studios, and DreamWorks Television. It ran for thirteen 40-minute episodes from February 5, 2000, to June 10, 2000, airing on NBC. It concerned a group of people with various psychic talents as they encountered different, and often evil, paranormal forces. It was an ensemble series. It featured in the third attempt by NBC to air a Saturday night supernatural/paranormal programming block, joining &quot;The Pretender&quot; and &quot;Profiler&quot; as the Thrillogy, but all three shows were canceled by season&#x27;s end.

==Premise==
Marian Kitt, a university student, is forced to come to terms with her frequently unwanted paranormal abilities, attempting to do so by joining The Others, a group with similar talents. The series gradually built up an overall storyline of a strong evil power targeting the group.

==Cast==
* Julianne Nicholson as Marian Kitt
* Gabriel Macht as Mark Gabriel
* Missy Crider (credited as &#x27;Melissa Crider&#x27;) as Ellen &quot;Satori&quot; Pawlowski
* Bill Cobbs as Elmer Greentree
* John Billingsley as Professor Miles Ballard
* Kevin J. O&#x27;Connor as Warren Day
* John Aylward as Albert McGonagle

==Episodes==
Note that the episodes were not always broadcast by NBC in the correct story order. For the correct story order for the episodes, refer to the order from the production codes.

==Production==
The series&#x27; writers included Glen Morgan and James Wong, who were also executive producers for the series along with Brancato and Ferris. Morgan&#x27;s wife Kristen Cloke played the significant role of Allison/The Woman in the episodes &quot;The Ones That Lie in Wait&quot; and &quot;Life Is for the Living&quot;. Tobe Hooper directed one episode, &quot;Souls on Board&quot;, and Bill Condon directed the episode &quot;1112&quot;.

The series was filmed at Paramount Studios. The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Writing of the series, Brancato stated in his personal blog in 2009 &quot;Mike and I&#x27;d had a dismal few years. We&#x27;d created a TV show, only to have it run into the ground by a pair of loathsome show-runners.&quot;

==Broadcast==
The series aired on Five in the UK, and on Nine in Australia.

==Reception==
Michael Speier of &quot;Variety&quot; was lukewarm on the first episode of the series, noting that &quot;the roles here are one-note: no humor and no sparks, just a lot of paranoia&quot;, but adding &quot;Bill Condon (&quot;Gods and Monsters) and Tobe Hooper (&quot;Poltergeist&quot;) have already wrapped upcoming episodes, and it’s hoped their styles will generate bigger oohs and aahs than the Mick Garris-helmed pilot.&quot; Howard Rosenberg of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was more openly critical of the series, declaring &quot;There’s nothing especially thoughtful or suspenseful here, for example, and Episodes 1 and 2, after raising expectations of creepiness, both end with soft thuds.&quot; By contrast, Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series a favorable review, commenting that &quot;The Others&quot; &quot;has a bewitching cast that mixes appealing up-and-comers (including Melissa Crider...) with reliable old-timers (like the always-wonderful Bill Cobbs...)&quot;, adding that the series was &quot;compellingly creepy&quot;.

<text>The white-browed bulbul (Pycnonotus luteolus) is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is a resident breeder in Sri Lanka and peninsular India. Largely olive coloured above with whitish underparts, it has a pale supercilium and a yellow vent. They are found in dense scrub habitats, where they skulk within vegetation and can be difficult to see although their loud and distinct burst of calls is distinctive.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;P. l. luteolus&quot; - : Found in central and southern India 
* &quot;P. l. insulae&quot; - : Found in Sri Lanka

==Description==

The white-browed bulbul is about long, with a moderately long () tail. It has olive-grey upperparts and whitish underparts. This species is identifiable by the white , white crescent below the eye, and dark eyestripe and moustachial stripe. The vent is yellowish and there is some yellow on the chin and moustache. The throat is, however, largely whitish unlike in the similar looking and sounding yellow-throated bulbul, which is found in rockier habitats. Three or four hair-like s are present on the nape. Sexes are similar in plumage. It is usually detected by the burst of song that it produces from the top of a bush and often dives into the bush becoming difficult to see. The song is a rich, spluttering warble and the bird is more often heard than seen. &quot;P. l. insulae&quot; is slightly darker and has a shorter wing than the nominate race.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. The northern boundary occurs across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and western West Bengal (near Midnapur). It is found in dry open scrub country mainly on the plains and also occurs in gardens and woodlands with dense shrubbery.

==Behaviour and ecology==
White-browed bulbuls are usually seen singly or in pairs. They forage within bushes for fruit, nectar and insects. The breeding season is spread out from March to September and they may possibly breed twice a year. Peaks in breeding occur in February and again in September. The dry season of May to July appears to be avoided for breeding in the Point Calimere region. They build a nest, a loose cup made of twigs, cobwebs and hair placed low in a thick bush and usually on the periphery. Two eggs form the typical clutch.
Individuals may live for more than 11 years.

<text>Catherine O&#x27;Leary (née Donegan; March 1827 – July 3, 1895) was an Irish immigrant living in Chicago, Illinois, who became famous when it was alleged that an accident involving her cow had started the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Born Catherine Donegan, she and her husband, Patrick O&#x27;Leary, had three children. Their son, James Patrick O&#x27;Leary, later ran a well-known Chicago saloon and gambling hall.

== Great Chicago Fire==
On the evening of October 8, 1871, a fire consumed the O&#x27;Leary family&#x27;s barn at 137 DeKoven Street. Due to a high wind and dry conditions, it spread to burn a large percentage of the city, an event known as the Great Chicago Fire.

After the Great Fire, &quot;Chicago Republican&quot; (now defunct) reporter Michael Ahern published a claim that the fire had started when a cow kicked over a lantern while it was being milked. The owner was not named, but Catherine O&#x27;Leary soon was identified, because the fire had begun in her family&#x27;s barn. Illustrations and caricatures soon appeared depicting Mrs. O&#x27;Leary with her cow. The idea captured the popular imagination and still is circulated widely today. However, in 1893
Ahern finally admitted he had made up the story.

The official report simply states: &quot;Whether it originated from a spark blown from a chimney on that windy night, or was set on fire by human agency, we are unable to determine&quot;.

Mrs. O&#x27;Leary testified that she had been in bed when the fire began, and she had no idea what caused it. Daniel &quot;Pegleg&quot; Sullivan, the first person to raise the alarm, said that on seeing the barn on fire, he ran to free the animals, which included a cow owned by Sullivan&#x27;s mother. He then informed the O&#x27;Learys, who were in their home and were unaware of the fire.
Anti-Irish attitudes at the time encouraged making scapegoats of the O&#x27;Leary family. It was claimed that the alleged accident happened because she was drunk or that she had hidden the evidence of her guilt. Neighbors were reported to have claimed that they saw broken glass from the lamp, though all these &quot;reports&quot; were unverified. One man claimed he had found the damaged lamp, but it had been stolen by another Irishman to protect the O&#x27;Learys.

Other rumors insisted that Daniel Sullivan had started the fire, or that perhaps it was Louis M. Cohn, who claimed to have been gambling in the barn with the O&#x27;Learys&#x27; son and others. One of the O&#x27;Learys&#x27; sons, James Patrick O&#x27;Leary, who was two years old at the time of the fire, did go on to become a well-known gambling boss and saloon owner in Chicago.

==Death and aftermath==
Catherine O&#x27;Leary died on July 3, 1895, of acute pneumonia at her home at 5133 Halsted Street, and was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery. In the PBS documentary &quot;Chicago: City of the Century&quot;, a descendant of O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s stated that she spent the rest of her life in the public eye, and she constantly was blamed for starting the fire. Overcome with much sadness and regret, she &quot;died heartbroken&quot;.

The last remaining immediate relative of Catherine O&#x27;Leary died in 1936. Amateur historian Richard Bales gathered sufficient evidence on Sullivan to convince the Chicago City Council to exonerate O&#x27;Leary of any guilt in 1997.

<text>Metallate or metalate is the name given to any complex anion containing a metal ligated to several atoms or small groups.

Typically, the metal will be one of the transition elements and the ligand will be oxygen or another chalcogenide or a cyanide group (though others are known). The chalcogenide metallates are known as oxometallates, thiometallates, selenometallates and tellurometallates; the cyanide metallates are known as cyanometallates.

[[Oxometallates]] include permanganate (), chromate () and vanadate ( or ).

[[Thiometallates]] include tetrathiovanadate (), tetrathiomolybdate (), tetrathiotungstate () and similar ions.

[[Cyanometallates]] include ferricyanide and ferrocyanide.

Metallate is also used as a verb by bioinorganic chemistry to describe the act of adding metal atoms or ions to a site (synthetic ligand or protein).

<text>Paul Gustave Simonon (; born 15 December 1955) is an English musician and artist best known as the bassist for the Clash. More recent work includes his involvement in the supergroup the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen and playing on the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; in 2010, which saw Simonon reunite with The Clash guitarist Mick Jones and Blur frontman Damon Albarn – and which also led to Simonon becoming the live band&#x27;s touring bassist for Gorillaz&#x27;s Escape to Plastic Beach Tour. Simonon is also an established visual artist.

==Early life==
Simonon was born in Thornton Heath, Croydon, Surrey. His father, Gustave, was an amateur artist and his mother, Elaine, was a librarian. Simonon&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a Belgian refugee who came to England during the First World War. Paul grew up in both the London areas of Brixton and Ladbroke Grove. Before joining the Clash, he had planned to become an artist. He studied at Byam Shaw School of Art (then based in Campden St, Kensington), which he attended on scholarship.

==Career==

He met Mick Jones in 1976, and six months later the Clash was formed when Joe Strummer joined, with Jones on lead guitar. Simonon learned his bass parts by rote from Jones in the early days of The Clash and still did not know how to play the bass when the group first recorded. He is credited with coming up with the name of the band and was mainly responsible for the visual aspects such as clothing and stage backdrops. Simonon was shown on the front cover of the band&#x27;s double album &quot;London Calling&quot;: Pennie Smith&#x27;s image of him smashing his Fender Precision Bass guitar during a 1979 concert in New York City; the image has become one of the iconic pictures of the punk era.

Simonon played bass on almost all of the Clash&#x27;s songs. Recordings that he did not play on include: &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;Lightning Strikes (Not Once but Twice)&quot; on &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (played by Norman Watt-Roy), &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; on &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (played by Topper Headon), and &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; (played by Norman Watt-Roy). &quot;Sandinista!&quot; featured bass played by Jones or Strummer, some but possibly not all of which Simonon later re-recorded once he rejoined the sessions after filming &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains&quot;. Also, when performing &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; live he switched instruments with Joe Strummer, because it was easier for him to sing while playing guitar, instead of bass as he sings lead vocals on this track.

Simonon&#x27;s contrapuntal reggae/ska-influenced lines set him apart from the bulk of other punk rock bassists of the era in their complexity and the role of the bass guitar within the band.

After the Clash dissolved in 1986, Simonon started a band called Havana 3am. He recorded one album with them. He also participated in a Bob Dylan session along with the Sex Pistols&#x27; Steve Jones that became part of the Dylan album &quot;Down in the Groove&quot;. Also, Simonon works as an artist – his first passion before joining the Clash. He has had several gallery shows, and designed the cover for Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s album, &quot;Tighten Up, Vol. 88&quot;, as well as the cover for &quot;Herculean&quot; from the album &quot;The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen&quot;, a project with Damon Albarn on which Simonon plays bass. Paul reunited with Damon Albarn and Mick Jones on the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, and was also the bassist of the Gorillaz live band supporting &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, along with Mick Jones on guitar. The band headlined the 2010 Coachella Festival, and took up residence at the Camden roundhouse for two nights in late April 2010.

In 2011, Simonon spent time aboard the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Esperanza&quot; incognito under the guise of &quot;Paul the assistant cook&quot; in response to Arctic oil drilling in Greenland by Cairn Oil. He joined other Greenpeace activists in illegally boarding one of Cairn&#x27;s oil rigs; an action which earned him two weeks in a Greenland jail. His identity was revealed to other crew members after the voyage, and he joined Damon Albarn and the other members of the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen for a performance in London celebrating Greenpeace&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

Actor Pete Morrow portrays Simonon in the 2016 film &quot;London Town&quot;. The film was met with mixed reviews.

In 2023, Simonon announced a new album, &quot;Can We Do Tomorrow Another Day?&quot;, in collaboration with singer Galen Ayers. The project arose out of Simonon&#x27;s time writing music in Mallorca during the COVID-19 lockdown and subsequently busking in front of cafes in Palma.

<text>Andrzej Zaucha (born 1967) is a Polish journalist and writer.

Born in Zakliczyn near Tarnów, southern Poland, Zaucha has reported as a journalist in Russia and Chechnya. Since 1997 he has been based in Moscow as a correspondent for the Polish daily &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, private radio station RMF FM, and television network TVN. In 2003 Zaucha published &quot;Moscow: Nord-Ost&quot; regarding the terrorist attack on Moscow&#x27;s Dubrovka Theatre in October 2002.

He has also reported for TVN and TVN24 stations on, among other things, Russian presidential and parliamentary elections, political demonstrations in Moscow, the Polish Tu-154 crash in Smolensk and Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea.

In March 2022, after the start of Russian aggression against Ukraine and the adoption by the Russian parliament of a law that harms the media (providing for up to 15 years in prison for “untrue” - from the Kremlin&#x27;s point of view - information about the actions of the Russian military), it was withdrawn from Russian territory.

<doc id="623472" wikidata="Q1327633" url="?curid=623472" title="The Palace of Auburn Hills">
<text>The Palace of Auburn Hills, commonly known as the Palace, was a multi-purpose arena located in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Opened in 1988, it was the home of the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Detroit Shock of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League, the Detroit Rockers of the National Professional Soccer League, the Detroit Neon/Detroit Safari of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, and the Detroit Fury of the Arena Football League.

The Palace was one of eight basketball arenas owned by their respective NBA franchises. The Pistons moved to Little Caesars Arena in Midtown Detroit in 2017 and the Palace was demolished in 2020.

==Naming==
By the time it closed as an NBA venue, the Palace was one of only two arenas that had not sold its naming rights to a corporate sponsor. The other was Madison Square Garden.

The court was previously named the &quot;William Davidson Court&quot;, in honor of late owner Bill Davidson, prior to the Pistons&#x27; home opener on October 30, 2009. His signature, along with the retired numbers, were removed from the hardwood when Tom Gores bought the Palace and were re-retired on its rafters as replacement banners.

==History==
===Background===
From 1957 to 1978, the Pistons competed in Detroit&#x27;s Olympia Stadium, Memorial Building, and Cobo Arena. In 1978, owner Bill Davidson elected not to share the new Joe Louis Arena with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings, instead opting to relocate the team to the Pontiac Silverdome in suburban Pontiac, a venue constructed for football, where it remained for the next decade. While the Silverdome could accommodate massive crowds, it offered substandard sight lines for basketball games. In late 1985, a group led by Davidson decided to build a new arena in Auburn Hills. Groundbreaking for the arena took place in June 1986. Using entirely private funding, The Palace cost a relatively low price of $90 million. The Davidson family held a controlling interest in the arena until Tom Gores bought it as part of his purchase of the Pistons in 2011.

===Construction===
Then-Pistons owner Bill Davidson and two developers privately financed the $90 million construction of The Palace, and did not require public funds.

The Palace was built with 180 luxury suites, considered an exorbitant number when it opened, virtually all later consistently leased. In December 2005, the Palace added five underground luxury suites, each containing of space and renting for $450,000 per year. Eight more luxury suites, also located below arena level, were opened in February 2006. They range in size from and were rented for $350,000 annually. The architectural design of the Palace, including its multiple tiers of luxury suites, has been used as the basis for many other arenas in North America since its construction.

===Basketball===
The Palace opened in 1988. When one of its basketball occupants won a championship, the number on its address changed. Its address was 6 Championship Drive, reflecting the Pistons&#x27; three NBA titles and the Shock&#x27;s three WNBA titles.

The Palace was widely considered to be the first of the modern-style NBA arenas, and its large number of luxury suites was a major reason for the building boom of new NBA arenas in the 1990s. Although the Palace became one of the oldest arenas in the NBA, its foresighted design contained the amenities that most NBA teams have sought in new arenas built since that time. By contrast, of the other NBA venues that opened during the 1988–89 season, Charlotte Coliseum, Miami Arena, the Bradley Center and ARCO Arena were considered obsolete relatively quickly, due to a lack of luxury suites and club seating, lucrative revenue-generating features that made pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term.

Nonetheless, Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment (PS&amp;E) had spent $117.5 million in upgrades and renovations to keep the arena updated. A new high definition JumboTron monitor, new LED video monitors, and more than of ribbon display technology from Daktronics was installed in the mid-2000s.

====The Malice at the Palace====

On November 19, 2004, a fight broke out between members of the Pistons and Indiana Pacers after Pacers forward Ron Artest committed a hard foul on Pistons center Ben Wallace. As the on-court fight died down, a fan, John Green, threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, who then ran into the stands to fight another fan, Michael Ryan, whom he mistakenly believed to be responsible, and this immediately escalated into a full-scale brawl between other fans and players. The fight lasted for several minutes and resulted in the suspension of nine players (including Artest, who was suspended for the remainder of the 2004–05 NBA season and also the playoffs), criminal charges against five players, and criminal charges against five spectators. The offending fans, including Green, Charlie Haddad and A.J. Shackleford, were banned for life from attending games at the Palace. In the aftermath of the fight, the NBA decided to increase the security presence between players and spectators. The fact that the fight took place at the Palace led to it becoming colloquially referred to as the &quot;Malice at the Palace&quot; and the &quot;Basketbrawl&quot;.

On July 22, 2008, nearly four years after this incident, another fight took place at the Palace, this time between the Detroit Shock and Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. This fight was dubbed &quot;The Malice at the Palace II&quot;.

===Replacement and demolition===
In October 2016, it was reported that the Pistons&#x27; ownership were negotiating a possible relocation to Little Caesars Arena, a new multi-purpose venue then under construction in Midtown Detroit, for the 2017–18 season. Little Caesars Arena was initially designed for ice hockey to replace Joe Louis Arena as home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings, so some design modifications were needed to accommodate the Pistons. On November 22, 2016, the team officially announced that they would play at Little Caesars Arena in 2017. The final NBA game at The Palace was played on April 10, 2017, with the Pistons losing to the Washington Wizards, 105–101. This game ended a 42-year history of professional sports in Oakland County.

Bob Seger held the final concert at the venue on September 23, 2017. The last scheduled event at the venue was the Taste of Auburn Hills on October 12, 2017. Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment entered into a joint venture with Olympia Entertainment known as 313 Presents to jointly manage entertainment bookings and promotions for Little Caesars Arena and other venues owned by the firms.

At its closure, the Palace was still in top condition as a sporting and concert venue, but its location in a northern suburb, far from the city center, conflicted with a trend of &quot;walkable urbanism&quot; that the Pistons thought would grow their fanbase. It was speculated that the Palace would likely end up being demolished, and the site would be redeveloped to accommodate a possible new auto supplier headquarters and research and development parks.

In August 2018, the arena&#x27;s Palace360 scoreboard, installed in 2014, was sold to the Arizona Coyotes to replace the old one at Desert Diamond Arena in time for the 2018–19 season.

In October 2018, it was reported Oakland University considered purchasing the arena. Ultimately, a deal never went through.

On June 24, 2019, the arena was sold to a joint venture, which planned to redevelop the property into a mixed-use office park. Demolition of the arena began in February 2020. Demolition was completed on July 11, 2020, when the roof was demolished using explosives by Controlled Demolition, Inc. General Motors purchased the site in 2023, to build a parts plant in support of its electric cars.

<doc id="623475" wikidata="Q437559" url="?curid=623475" title="Armand van Helden">
<text>Armand Van Helden (born February 16, 1970) is an American DJ, record producer, remixer and songwriter from Boston, Massachusetts. He is considered one of house music&#x27;s most revered figures, with a career spanning three decades. 

Van Helden&#x27;s best-known singles are &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, &quot;I Want Your Soul&quot;, &quot;My My My&quot; featuring Tara McDonald, and &quot;Bonkers&quot; featuring Dizzee Rascal, all of which became #1 on the UK Dance Chart and reached as high as #2 on the Billboard Dance Chart.

In 2009, Van Helden formed the DJ duo Duck Sauce with Canadian DJ A-Trak, receiving a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording for their song &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; which topped the charts in 12 countries. The duo also released the singles &quot;Anyway&quot; which reached No. 1 the UK Dance Chart, &quot;Big Bad Wolf&#x27; and &quot;NRG&quot;. 

Although much of his chart success has been in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, Van Helden has been closely linked to the electronic music scene of New York since the early-mid 1990s where he was considered one of the best remixers in the business and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording in 1998. Van Helden often remixes and uses samples of funk, soul, R&amp;B and hip hop. He also uses filters and dub progressions, as in NYC beat, dancehall and reggae samples. Among his greatest remixes have been the remix of the song &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; by Sneaker Pimps, &quot;The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind)&quot; by The Bucketheads, &quot;Sugar Is Sweeter&quot; by C. J. Bolland and &quot;Professional Widow&quot; by Tori Amos.

Van Helden is widely regarded as the pioneer of the speed garage genre and has continued remixing various artists such as Katy Perry, Van Halen, Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams, Britney Spears, Enrique Iglesias, David Guetta, Sam Smith, Bloc Party, Janet Jackson, Juliet Roberts and KRS-One among others with this musical style. Recent releases include the singles &quot;I Need a Painkiller&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot; produced in 2018 and 2016 respectively.

== Biography ==
Van Helden was born to an Indo (Dutch and Indonesian descent) father and a mother of French and Lebanese ancestry. He moved around the world as a child, spending time in the Netherlands, Latvia, Turkey, and Italy as his father was a member of the U.S. Air Force. At the age of 13, he got his first DJ gig at a Valentine&#x27;s Day dance and around the same time, he bought a drum machine.

From circa 1986–1988, Van Helden was in a rap group named &quot;Define&quot; because they considered themselves &quot;de finest around&quot; and accordingly &quot;defined&quot; rap music. His name was DJ AVH, along with fellow crew members: Sir Beat, and Lopoka. They performed across Europe and helped hone his DJ skills.

Van Helden returned to Boston in 1988, moonlighting as a DJ in Boston clubs. He attended college in Boston. He quit his legal-review job in 1991 to work as a remixer under the management of Neil Petricone and X-Mix. He took up a DJ residency at the Loft, a top Boston nightclub at the time. He released his first official single, a mix of Deep Creed&#x27;s &quot;Stay On My Mind&quot; through Nervous Records.

Van Helden released &quot;Move It To the Left&quot; (credited to Sultans of Swing) in 1992 on the Strictly Rhythm label, which became a moderate club hit and led to a string of singles released under several monikers for that label. His first track to make the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart was &quot;Witch Doktor&quot;, which made the top 5 in 1994, and led to opportunities to remix acts such as New Order, Deep Forest, Jimmy Somerville, Deee-Lite, and Faithless.

However, it was the &quot;Professional Widow&quot; remix that established Van Helden and became a dance hit around the world and as a number-one hit in the United Kingdom. Van Helden stated of his compensation for the remix: &quot;it was like $10,000, and that was a little below what I was making back then for a remix, but I had the time.&quot; However, it led to work remixing the Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Puff Daddy, Daft Punk and Sneaker Pimps, adding to his reputation as one of the world&#x27;s top house-music musicians.

In 1996, Van Helden collaborated with Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, Van Helden and Junior Sanchez as Da Mongoloids, releasing &quot;Spark da Meth&quot; on the Strictly Rhythm label. A year later Van Helden&#x27;s track &quot;Ten Minutes of Funk&quot; was featured on the Daft Punk live album &quot;Alive 1997&quot;.

&quot;Cha Cha&quot; was another top-ten dance hit from Van Helden&#x27;s first album, &quot;Old School Junkies: The Album&quot;, which was released in 1996, along with &quot;The Funk Phenomena&quot;. A greatest hits album appeared the next year, followed by a breakbeat album later in 1997. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; was a number two hit on the Billboard dance chart, a number one hit in the United Kingdom, and a top 20 single on the pop charts in Australia and Canada. The song was the breakout track from his &quot;2Future4U&quot; album, which was released stateside on Armand&#x27;s own label, Armed Records.

Van Helden released the &quot;Killing Puritans&quot; album in 2000 (also on Armed Records), which contained the hit &quot;Koochy&quot;. The track was based around Gary Numan&#x27;s five times UK chart hit, &quot;Cars&quot;. His single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t You Free Some Time&quot; made it to number 34 in the UK in 2001. His &quot;New York: A Mix Odyssey&quot; album released in March 2004 produced two hits: &quot;Hear My Name&quot;, a collaboration with Spalding Rockwell that reached number 7 on the Billboard dance chart, number 34 in the UK, and the top 40 in Australia; and &quot;My My My&quot; featuring Tara McDonald, which reached number 4 on the world internet charts, number 5 in the Belgian and Dutch charts, number 6 in Australia, number 15 in the UK, and top 30 in the world dance charts. In April 2004, he provided a mix for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Essential Mix show.

In 2005, Van Helden released the album &quot;Nympho&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;Into Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;My My My&quot;, &quot;Hear My Name&quot;, and &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;. The album reached the top 30 in Australia, and number 48 in the UK. &quot;When The Lights Go Down&quot; reached No. 52 on the ARIA Charts in Australia, and was a dance and club hit.

Van Helden was the featured DJ in the Southern Fried tent at Get Loaded in the Park at Clapham Common on the August Bank Holiday in 2005.

In 2006, Van Helden re-released &quot;My My My&quot; featuring the British singer Tara McDonald, which reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK dance charts. Remixes included the Funktuary radio edit and Stonebridge remix. In 2007, Van Helden released his new album, &quot;Ghettoblaster&quot;, from which he released the singles &quot;NYC Beat,&quot; which reached number 22 on the UK chart, and &quot;I Want Your Soul,&quot; which reached number 19. In 2008, Van Helden gained more commercial success by remixing &quot;INSPIRE&quot;, a No. 1 hit by the Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki. This remix was released on the album &quot;Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold&quot;. Also in 2008, Van Helden released two albums, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me: The Best of Armand Van Helden&quot; and a mix album titled &quot;New York: a Mix Odyssey 2&quot;. When discussing this mix in a 2009 interview with 5mag.net, Armand said, &quot;I just went back to hip-hop. I put my head where I used to be when I was 19. It was a blast making it. Hip-house was just so great.&quot;

In May 2009, Van Helden collaborated with British rapper Dizzee Rascal on his single &quot;Bonkers&quot;. It peaked at number one in the United Kingdom, where it stayed for two weeks and became Van Helden&#x27;s third chart-topper in Britain. Later in 2009, Van Helden worked with A-Trak to create &quot;aNYway&quot; which was released in October under the name Duck Sauce. The duo later gained chart success with the song &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot;, which peaked at number three in the United Kingdom and within the top ten of the charts in other European markets.

Van Helden teamed up with American DJ/producer Steve Aoki in 2011 to produce the song &quot;Brrrat!&quot;, which featured on Godskitchen&#x27;s eclectic album. In early 2011, Van Helden stated that he had planned an album for 2014.

Van Helden teamed up with fellow DJ/producer A-Trak in 2011 to form Duck Sauce. The duo scored hits with &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; and &quot;The Big Bad Wolf&quot;. In 2013, Duck Sauce released the song &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot;, a hit on the dancefloor throughout the world, and has been nominated for the MTV Video Awards. In October of the same year, they presented two new songs, &quot;Stereo Radio&quot; with Duck Sauce and &quot;I Know A Place&quot; (featuring Spank Rock). In 2014, Van Helden collaborated with Cheap Thrills label boss and DJ Hervé to release their recent song &quot;Power of Bass&quot; Duck Sauce, released their debut album, &quot;Quack&quot;, released on April 15 through Fool&#x27;s Gold Records. The album features the duo&#x27;s long chain of singles. The new Duck Sauce video for &quot;NRG&quot; is filmed as an infomercial.

In August 2014, Sam Smith&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Only One&quot; featured a remix by Van Helden. In September 2014, Van Helden remixed for Jungle 70 and Majestic with Creeping In The Dark.

In April 2015, London-based Snakehips released Forever Pt. II EP, which spurred a series of well-received remixes, including a Duck Sauce remix of their song &quot;Forever&quot;.

Van Helden returned in March 2020 with a new song, &quot;Give Me Your Loving&quot; with Lorne.

<text>The British Psychological Society (BPS) is a representative body for psychologists and psychology in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
It was founded on 24 October 1901 at University College London (UCL) as &quot;The Psychological Society&quot;, the organisation initially admitted only recognised teachers in the field of psychology. The ten founder members were:

* Robert Armstrong-Jones
* Sophie Bryant
* W. R. Boyce Gibson
* Frank Noel Hales
* William McDougall
* Frederick Walker Mott
* W. H. R. Rivers
* Alexander Faulkner Shand
* William George Smith
* James Sully
Its current name of &quot;The British Psychological Society&quot; was taken in 1906 to avoid confusion with another group named &quot;The Psychological Society&quot;. Under the guidance of Charles Myers, membership was opened up to members of the medical profession in 1919. In 1941 the society was incorporated. In 1965 it was a granted a Royal charter.

== Organisation ==
The Society is both a learned and a professional body. As such it provides support and advice on research and practice issues. It is also a Registered Charity which imposes certain constraints on what it can and cannot do. For example, it cannot campaign on issues which are seen as party political. The BPS is not the statutory regulation body for Practitioner Psychologists in the UK which is the Health and Care Professions Council.

The Society has a large number of specialist and regional branches throughout the United Kingdom. It holds its Annual Conference, usually in May, in a different town or city each year. In addition, each of the sub-sections hold their own conferences and there is also a range of specialist meetings convened to consider relevant issues.

The Society is also a publishing body publishing a range of specialist journals, books and reports.

== Membership grades and post-nominals ==
In 2019 the BPS had 60,604 members and subscribers, in all fields of psychology, 20,243 of whom were Chartered Members. There are a number of grades of members:

* Members
** &quot;Student member&quot; (no post-nominal): The grade for students of psychology.
** &quot;Graduate Member&quot; (GMBPsS): Awarded to graduates of an undergraduate degree accredited by the society, or have completed an accredited conversion course.
** &quot;Full Member&quot; (FMBPsS): awarded to those with qualification in psychology and working in the field of psychology
** &quot;Associate Member&quot; (AMBPsS): awarded to wellbeing practitioners

* Fellows
** &quot;Associate Fellow&quot; (AFBPsS): Associate Fellowship may be awarded to nominees who have satisfied one of the following conditions since first becoming eligible for graduate membership:
: i) achieved eligibility for full membership of one of the society&#x27;s divisions and been successfully engaged in the professional application of a specialised knowledge of psychology for an aggregate of at least two calendar years full-time (or its part-time equivalent); or
: ii) possess a research qualification in psychology and been engaged in the application, discovery, development or dissemination of psychological knowledge or practice for an aggregate of at least four years full time (or its part time equivalent); or
: iii) published psychological works or exercised specialised psychological knowledge of a standard not less than in 1 or 2 above.
** &quot;Fellow&quot; (FBPsS): Fellowship may be awarded to nominees who have made an outstanding contribution to psychology (see :Category:Fellows of the British Psychological Society) by satisfying the following criteria:
: i) been engaged in work of a psychological nature (other than undergraduate training) for a total period of at least 10 years; and
: ii) possess an advanced knowledge of psychology in at least one of its fields; and
: iii) made an outstanding contribution to the advancement or dissemination of psychological knowledge or practice either by your own research, teaching, publications or public service, or by organising and developing the work of others.
** &quot;Honorary Fellow&quot; (HonFBPsS): Honorary Fellowship is awarded for distinguished service in the field of psychology.

==Professional qualifications==

*&quot;CPsychol&quot;: &quot;Chartered Psychologist&quot; - Following the receipt of a royal charter in 1965, the society became the keeper of the Register of Chartered Psychologists. The register was the means by which the Society could regulate the professional practice of psychology. Regulation included the awarding of practising certificates and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings. The register ceased to be when statutory regulation of psychologists began on 1 July 2009. The profession is now regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council. A member of the British Psychological Society (MBPsS) who has achieved chartered status has the right to the letters &quot;CPsychol&quot; after his or her name.
*&quot;CSci&quot;: &quot;Chartered Scientist&quot; - The Society is licensed by the Science Council for the registration of Chartered Scientists.
*&quot;EuroPsy&quot;: &quot;European Psychologist&quot; - The Society is a member of the European Federation of Psychologists&#x27; Associations (EFPA), and can award this designation to Chartered Psychologists.

== Response to the Cass Review ==

The Cass Review was published in April 2024, as an independent review of Gender Identity Services for Children and Young People, having been commissioned in 2020 by NHS England and NHS Improvement. It found, regarding medical interventions, a &quot;lack of high-quality evidence&quot;, and it made a large number of recommendations, including those in the psychological area relevant to the BPS, including social transition, and conflicting clinical views between &#x27;affirming care&#x27; versus &#x27;exploratory care&#x27;.

In June 2024 the BPS issued an update to their &quot;Guidelines for Psychologists Working with Gender, Sexuality and Relationship Diversity&quot;. An open letter criticising the BPS for not referring to the Cass Review in these guidelines was sent on 14 August to Professor Tony Lavender, Chair of the BPS Practice Board, by Pat Harvey, David Pilgrim and Peter Harvey, all BPS members and clinical psychologists. They state that the revised BPS guidelines: &quot;represent an active barrier to much needed change in philosophy and practice for psychologists working in re-formed Gender Services in the immediate future&quot;.

However, the BPS has clarified that its updated guidelines did not refer to the Cass Review because these relate to adults, not children and young people. The BPS made this point on its website:

The purpose of this interim review was to assess the content in the guidance and update where necessary and appropriate. We know that the area of U18s and gender incongruence is a challenging and often highly politically charged one, which is why we have begun recruitment for the Task and Finish Group. We estimate this work will take approximately 18 months.

Since 2003 the BPS has published reports on new psychology research in the form of a free fortnightly email, and since 2005, also in the form of an online blog – both are referred to as the BPS Research Digest. As of 2014, the BPS states that the email has over 32,000 subscribers and the Digest blog attracts hundreds of thousands of page views a month. In 2010 the Research Digest blog won &quot;best psychology blog&quot; in the inaugural Research Blogging Awards. The Research Digest has been written and edited by psychologist Christian Jarrett since its inception About usResearch into the mental health of prisoners, digested 

===Books===
The Society publishes a series of textbooks in collaboration with Wiley-Blackwell. These cover most of the core areas of psychology.

== Member networks: Sections, divisions, branches and groups ==
The British Psychological Society currently has ten divisions and nineteen sections. Divisions and sections differ in that the former are open to practitioners in a certain field of psychology, so professional and qualified psychologists only will be entitled to full membership of a division, whereas the latter are interest groups comprising members of the BPS who are interested in a particular academic aspect of psychology.

===Divisions===
The divisions include:
*Division of Academics, Researchers and Teachers in Psychology
*Division of Clinical Psychology
*Division of Coaching Psychology
*Division of Counselling Psychology
*Division of Educational and Child Psychology
*Division of Forensic Psychology
*Division of Health Psychology
*Division of Neuropsychology
*Division of Occupational Psychology
*Division of Sport and Exercise Psychology
*Scottish Division of Educational Psychology

The Division of Clinical Psychology is the largest division within the BPS – it is subdivided into thirteen faculties:
*Addiction 
*Children, Young People and their Families 
*Clinical Health Psychology 
*Eating Disorders 
*Forensic Clinical Psychology 
*HIV and Sexual Health 
*Holistic Psychology 
*Leadership and Management 
*Intellectual Disabilities 
*Oncology and Palliative Care 
*Perinatal Psychology 
*Psychosis and Complex Mental Health 
*Psychology of Older People 

===Sections===
The Sections currently include:
Note: The term &#x27;division&#x27; in the American Psychological Association does not have the same meaning as it does in the British Psychological Society, coming closer to what the British Psychological Society refers to as &#x27;sections&#x27;. Branches are for members in the same geographical region.

=== Special groups ===
BPS currently has the following special groups to provide a forum for members working in particular specialist fields, with a particular focus on training, practice, and professional development
===Regional Branches===
The Society also organises regional branches throughout the United Kingdom. These include the following branches: 
* East Midlands Branch
* East of England Branch
* London and Home Counties Branch
* North East of England Branch
* North West of England Branch
* Northern Ireland Branch
* Scottish Branch
* South West of England Branch
* Welsh Branch
* Wessex Branch
* West Midlands Branch

== Statutory regulation ==

BPS has been concerned with the question of statutory registration of psychologists since the 1930s. It received its charter in 1965 and an amendment in 1987 which allowed it to maintain a register of psychologists. The UK government announced its intention to widen statutory regulation, to include &quot;inter alia&quot; psychologists, following a number of scandals arising in the 1990s in the psychotherapy field. The BPS was in favour of statutory regulation, but opposed the proposed regulator, the Health Professions Council (HPC), preferring the idea of a new Psychological Professions Council which would map quite closely onto its own responsibilities. The government resisted this, however, and in June 2009, under the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order, regulation of most of the psychology professions passed to the HCPC, the renamed Health and Care Professions Council.

== Society offices ==
The Society&#x27;s main office is currently in Leicester in the United Kingdom. According to BPS HR department, as of April 2019 there were 113 staff members at the Leicester office, 9 in London. There are also smaller regional offices in Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow. The archives are deposited at the Wellcome Library in the Euston Road, London.

== Logo and YouTube ==
The British Psychological Society&#x27;s logo is an image of the Greek mythical figure Psyche, personification of the soul, holding an oil lamp. The use of her image is a reference to the origins of the word psychology. The lamp symbolises learning and is also a reference to the story of Psyche. Eros was in love with Psyche and would visit her at night, but had forbidden her from finding out his identity. She was persuaded by her jealous sisters to discover his identity by holding a lamp to his face as he slept. Psyche accidentally burnt him with oil from the lamp, and he awoke and flew away.

The Society has its own YouTube channel.

<text>The BMD-1 is a Soviet airborne amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), which was introduced in 1969 and first seen by the West in 1970. BMD stands for &quot;Boyevaya Mashina Desanta&quot; (Боевая Машина Десанта, which literally translates to &quot;Airborne Combat Vehicle&quot;). It can be dropped by parachute and although it is of similar shape to the BMP-1 it is smaller, at just over half the weight. The BMD-1 was used as an IFV by the Soviet Airborne Forces (VDV). An improved variant of the BMD-1 was developed, the BMD-2. The BMD-1 also provided a basis for the BTR-D airborne multi-purpose tracked APC.

==Development==
In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the army was instructed to consider putting more emphasis on means to project power outside of the normal sphere of Soviet influence. As a result, there was a major effort to develop the VDV as a rapid deployment force. Soviet studies of airborne operations had shown that lightly armed paratroops were unable to deal with armoured forces. Also, in the early 1960s, the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle was being developed. Before the BMP-1 entered service in 1966, the Soviet Army high command decided to equip the newly created airborne divisions with similar vehicles.

The use of Antonov An-12 aircraft during the BMD development limited the transport to only light armored vehicles for an airborne drop, each weighing less than seven tons. Because the existing BMP-1 weighed 13 tonnes, it was effectively ruled out of being considered for the VDV service.

The task of designing the BMD fell to the Volgograd Tractor Factory, which had produced an unsuccessful competitor to the Ob&#x27;yekt 764 that eventually became the BMP-1 – the Ob&#x27;yekt 914. The BMD design, Ob&#x27;yekt 915, was basically a trimmed-down version of the Ob&#x27;yekt 914 – smaller, lighter aluminium armour, while retaining the 73mm 2A28 &quot;Grom&quot; low-pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun. The compromise made is the extremely cramped crew compartment.

Development started in 1965 and trials began in 1967. A limited production began in 1968. After operational trials, it was commissioned on 14 April 1969 and serial production started in 1970, although the vehicle weighed 500 kg more than what the requirements stated (7.5 tonnes and 13.3 tonnes when loaded with equipment).

Starting from 1977 a new modernized vehicle received a designation BMD-1P following adoption of the new 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher instead of 9S428 ATGM launcher, firing the 9M113 Konkurs (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M111M Fagot or 9M111-2 (standard load: two 9M113 and one 9M111M missiles). Most of older BMD-1s were subsequently modernized this way.

In 1983, based on the combat experience in Afghanistan, a decision was made to produce a new variant of the BMD with a weapon capable of engaging targets such as those faced by the airborne troops in that conflict. This resulted in &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt 916&quot;, which later became the BMD-2.

A lengthened BMD-1 chassis served as the basis for the BTR-D airborne multi-purpose tracked APC, which itself served as a basis for many specialized airborne vehicles.

==Description==
===Overview===
The BMD-1 can be thought of as a BMP intended for airborne troops. The vehicle therefore must be lighter and smaller in order to meet airdrop weight requirements (the BMD-1 is secured to a pallet and parachute-dropped from cargo planes).

The BMD-1 has an unconventional layout for an IFV. From the front to the back of the vehicle, the compartments are located in the following formation: steering, fighting, troop, and engine. This is because the BMD-1 is based on Ob&#x27;yekt 914, which in turn is based on the PT-76 amphibious light tank (refer to for details). This meant that transported troops had to mount and dismount the vehicle via the roof hatches, which made them an easy target on the battlefield when these actions were performed.

===Crew===
The crew consists of four soldiers: driver, commander, gunner, and bow machine gunner, two of which (commander and machine gunner) are included in the number of soldiers carried. The driver&#x27;s station is located centrally in the front of the vehicle and has a hatch that is opened by raising it and rotating it to the right. The driver is provided with three periscope vision blocks, which allow him to view the outer environment when his hatch is closed. The center one can be replaced with a night vision device for use in the night and bad visibility conditions or with an extended periscope for swimming with the trim vane erected. The commander&#x27;s station is on the driver&#x27;s left. It is provided with a hatch, one periscope vision block, an outer environment observation device, and an R-123 radio set for communications. He also fires the left bow machine gun. The right one is operated by a bow machine gun gunner, who sits to the right of the driver. The gunner&#x27;s station is located on the left side of the turret, like in the BMP-1, and has the same equipment (see Gunner&#x27;s station section in the BMP-1 article for details).

===Turret===

The BMD-1 has the same turret as the BMP-1.

===Armament===

The vehicle is armed with a 73 mm 2A28 Grom gun and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun. Mounted on the mantlet is the 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 Malyutka (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A) and 9M14M Malyutka-M (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) ATGMs (for which the vehicle carries two ATGMs in the turret). There are also two 7.62 mm PKT machine guns in fixed mounts, one in each corner of the bow.

===Mobility===
====Maneuverability====
The vehicle is powered by a 5D-20 6-cylinder 4-stroke V-shaped liquid-cooled 15.9-liter diesel engine, which develops 270 hp (201 kW) at 2,600 revolutions per minute. The engine drives a manual gearbox with five forward and one reverse gear.

The BMD-1 has a maximum road speed of 80 kilometers per hour, reduced to around 45 kilometers per hour off-road and 10 kilometers per hour while swimming.

The BMD-1 can climb vertical obstacles, cross trenches, and 30% side slopes. It can climb 60% gradients. The BMD-1 has a ground pressure of 0.57 kg/cm2.

The 230 mm wide track is driven at the rear and passes over five small evenly spaced road wheels suspended on independent torsion bars. On each side, there is an idler wheel at the front, a rear drive sprocket, and four track-return rollers. The independent suspension combines a hydraulic system for altering the ground clearance and maintaining the track tension with pneumatic springs, which enables the ground clearance to be altered from 100 mm to 450 mm. The alternative ground clearance allows easier transportation in an airplane.

====Amphibious ability====
The BMD-1 is fully amphibious, it can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the two-piece trim vane which improves the vehicle&#x27;s stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding the bow of the tank, and switching the driver&#x27;s periscope for a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is placed in its laying position in the front of the bow under the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armour. There is also a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The bilge pumps keep the vehicle afloat even if it is hit, damaged or leaks. In water, it is propelled by two hydro jets, one on each side of the hull, with the entrance under the hull and exits at the rear of the hull. The rear exits have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed exits at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or float reverse, for example, to go left, the left water jet is closed, reducing thrust on that side and redirecting some or all of the water flow to the forward facing nozzle. To go right, the right water-jet is covered. The closure of the nozzles is proportionate to the control input. To make a 180° turn the left water-jet can direct water to the rear nozzle and the right water-jet to the front nozzle, creating forward thrust on one side and reverse thrust on the other, or the vehicle can reverse by closing both nozzles and directing all water flow out the forward nozzles (see PT-76 for full explanation of the water jet system).

====Air-drop techniques====
The vehicle can be transported by An-12, An-22, Il-76, An-124 airplanes and Mi-6 and Mi-26 helicopters.

The BMD was originally dropped under the MKS-350-9 multi-canopy parachute with a descending speed between 15 m/s and 20 m/s. The intention was to drop the vehicle off without the crew. This proved to be very problematic since the crew frequently landed at a considerable distance from the vehicle and often had trouble finding it. Also, the vehicle itself could easily land in a location from which it couldn&#x27;t be extracted (either because of a lack of suitable equipment or because of the location being virtually inaccessible). Several experiments were done in the 1970s in order to find a way to circumvent these limitations, including dropping the BMD with the two key crew members, the driver, and the gunner, seated inside the vehicle during the descent. The first such test took place on 23 January 1976 with Lieutenant-Colonel Leonid Shcherbakov and Major , and the concept was proved to be valid in a subsequent series of tests.

A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was developed to ensure the vehicle&#x27;s safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before take-off. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6 m/s and 7 m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing. This system entered service in 1975 and allows a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner.

===Armour protection===
The BMD-1&#x27;s armour is made of ABT-101 an alloy composed of 91% Aluminum, 6% Zinc, and 3% Magnesium. The BMD-2 on the other hand is composed of ABT-102, which is 94% Aluminum, 4% Zinc, and 2% Magnesium.

Armour thickness is 23 mm at 42° on the front of the turret, 19 mm at 36° on the sides of the turret, 13 mm at 30° on the rear of the turret, 6 mm on the top of the turret, 15 mm on the front of the hull and 10 mm on the rest of the hull. The hull&#x27;s front armour has two sections: upper and lower. The upper section is angled at 78° while the lower one is angled at 50°. It is resistant to small arms fire and shrapnel.

===Troop compartment===
Many compromises had to be made to the design in order to save the necessary weight, not least to crew comfort. The BMD-1 has an extremely cramped interior space, which is much smaller than that found in the BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs. It can carry five infantrymen, comprising the vehicle&#x27;s commander, bow machine gunner, and three soldiers seated behind a turret.

Nevertheless, it is equipped with periscope vision blocks on the sides and rear of the vehicle. There are only three firing ports, one on each side of the hull and one in the rear. As standard, the vehicle carries the following weapons inside the troop compartment: an RPG-7 or RPG-16 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher, which is to be operated by two soldiers, RPKS light machine gun, and five AKMS assault rifles. It also carries portable launchers for 9M14M Malyutka missiles (9M111/9M113 missiles in BMD-1P).

===Equipment===
The vehicle has electric and manual bilge pumps, Gpk-S9 gyro-compass, engine pre-heater, TDA smoke-generating equipment, FTP-100M NBC system, R-123 transceiver, R-124 intercom and a centralized methyl bromide fire extinguishing system, the same as the one fitted to other former Soviet armoured vehicles.

==Service history==
The BMD-1 entered serial production in 1968. It was produced by Volgograd Tractor Plant. Two airborne regiments of each airborne division were equipped with BMD-1 IFVs. Overall, each division operated 220 BMD-1 IFVs. It was displayed publicly for the first time during the Dvina exercise in the USSR in 1970. The BMD-1 was showcased for the second time during the Moscow Red Square parade in November 1973. Western governments originally classified the BMD-1 as a light tank before its true nature was known. Because of its small crew, the introduction of the BMD led to a reduction in the number of soldiers in an airborne battalion, from 610 to 316 men. The firepower of the BMD also meant that some of the battalion&#x27;s integral fire support could be done away with. In 1973, the BMD-1 completely replaced the ASU-57 airborne assault guns in the Soviet airborne forces, increasing the firepower and maneuverability of the airborne division. Since 1977 a number of Soviet BMD-1 IFVs underwent a modernization to the BMD-1P standard.
===Ogaden War===
In 1978, a force of 70 Cuban Army BMD-1s and ASU-57s fighting on behalf of the Ethiopian government was airlifted by Mi-6 helicopters behind the lines of Somali forces holding the town of Jijiiga. This attack formed a pincer with a conventional Cuban armored push and routed the Somali forces in Ogaden.

===Soviet–Afghan War===
It was widely used by airborne units during Soviet–Afghan War. During the initial Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, BMD-1s of the Soviet 103rd Guards Airborne Division and 345th Separate Parachute Regiment were air landed by Il-76 transports into Kabul airport and Bagram Airfield, enabling the rapid seizure of critical cities and facilities throughout Afghanistan. The 56th Air Assault Brigade executed a similar capture of Kunduz. For the remainder of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan through 1989, airborne forces under the 40th Army used BMD-1s as infantry fighting vehicles for transportation and fire support in operations against the mujahideen.

BMD-1 IFVs were not suited for fighting in the hot mountain regions of Afghanistan, as they were originally developed to provide airborne units with an IFV to give them a chance in engagements with enemy armour and allow them to operate in Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) warfare conditions. In Afghanistan, the main enemies were not AFVs but land mines and ambushes prepared by skillful Afghan Mujahideen armed with light anti-tank weapons, which meant that the BMD-1&#x27;s anti-tank firepower was useless. Many BMD-1 IFVs and light APCs fell victim to Mujahideen attacks and antitank landmines. The Soviet Army lost 1,317 APCs and IFVs of all types during nine years of war in Afghanistan.

===Iraq===
Iraqi BMD-1s were deployed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Former Yugoslavia===
BMD-1 and BMD-1PK IFVs are used by the Russian airborne units in KFOR. BMD-1 IFVs were used by Russian airborne units in SFOR.

===2008 Georgia–Russia War===
During the Russo-Georgian War, BMD-1s of the 104th Airborne Assault Regiment of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division advanced into South Ossetia and successfully engaged Georgian Army troops and vehicles. However, the BMD&#x27;s visual and sighting equipment was criticized as being primitive.

===2014 Russo-Ukrainian War===
During the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014 in Eastern Ukraine, BMD-1s were used both by mechanized units of the Ukrainian Army and in smaller numbers by the separatists of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic. It was claimed that a BMD-1 was one of the six armored vehicles in Separatist forces defending Sloviansk when it was besieged.

===Present service===

As of now, BMD-1 and vehicles based on it are used by the following units of Russian Airborne Troops or are stationed in following bases (this list does not include BTR-D APCs and BTR-D variants):

76th Guards Air Assault Division (CDO) from Pskov, which is part of Leningrad Military District (210 BMD vehicles as of 2000), the subunits of this division include 104th airborne regiment from Pskov (51 BMD-1) and 234th airborne regiment from Pskov (98 BMD-1).

98th Guards Airborne Division from Ivanovo (220 BMD vehicles as of 2000), the subunits of this division include 217th Guards Airborne Regiment from Ivanovo (109 BMD-1) and 331st airborne regiment from Kostroma (102 BMD-1).

106th Guards Airborne Division from Tula, which is a part of the Moscow Military District (306 BMD as of 2000), the subunits of this division include 51st airborne regiment from Tula (93 BMD-1) and 137th airborne regiment from Ryazan (10 BMD-1).

7th Guards Airborne Mountain Division CDO from Novorossyysk (190 BMD and BMP vehicles as of 2000), the subunits of this division include 108th Guards Air Assault Regiment from Novorossyysk (70 BMD-1) and 743rd commandos battalion from Novorossyysk (6 BMD-1).

31st Separate Airborne Brigade from Ul&#x27;yanovsk, which is a part of the Volga-Ural Military District (26 BMD-1 as of 2000).

Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School (51 BMD-1).

99th Internal Troops division from Rostov, Persianovka, which is a part of the North Caucasus Military District (4 BMD-1 and 33 BMD-1 IFVs in the Cherkmen regiment).

81st tank repair plant from Armavir (Krasnodar) (1 BMD-1).

===Replacement===
The Russian military was considering replacing the BMD series altogether with the GAZ-3937. This very lightweight wheeled armoured personnel carrier that incorporates plastic and carbon fibre in its construction, as well as aluminum. The GAZ-3937 can be air-dropped like the BMD, but is considerably lighter and less expensive to manufacture. Since the GAZ-3937 lacks the armor protection, cross-country mobility, and heavy armament of the BMD series, and is armed only with a 7.62 mm PKM machine gun in front of the commander&#x27;s hatch, the BMD-4 (an upgraded BMD-3) has been selected for the future use of the Russian airborne and naval infantry. The BMD-4 uses the same 100 mm main gun with 30 mm autocannon and 7.62 mm medium machine gun turret on an improved, larger hull raising overall weight to the 15-ton class. The waterjet swim propulsion systems of the BMD-3/4 are strong enough to enable ship-to-shore transport, resulting in Russian naval infantry use.

<text>The Celtic Sea is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the southern coast of Ireland bounded to the north by Saint George&#x27;s Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, parts of Devon and Brittany. The continental shelf, which drops away sharply, delimits the southern and western boundaries. The Iroise Sea off Brittany is entirely included within it. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.

==History==
The Celtic Sea receives its name from the Celtic heritage of the bounding lands to the north and east. E. W. L. Holt proposed the name at a 1921 meeting of fisheries experts from Great Britain, France, and Ireland in Dublin. This sea&#x27;s northern portion was considered part of Saint George&#x27;s Channel, and the southern portion was an undifferentiated part of the &quot;Southwest Approaches&quot; to Great Britain. The desire for a common name came to be felt because of the area&#x27;s common marine biology, geology and hydrology.

It was adopted in France before being common in English-speaking countries. In 1957, Édouard Le Danois wrote, &quot;the name &quot;Celtic Sea&quot; is hardly known even to oceanographers.&quot; Marine biologists and oceanographers adopted it, and later, by petroleum exploration firms. It is named in a 1963 British atlas, but a 1972 article states, &quot;what British maps call the Western Approaches, and what the oil industry calls the Celtic Sea [...] certainly the residents on the western coast [of Great Britain] don&#x27;t refer to it as such.&quot;

==Seabed==

The seabed under the Celtic Sea is referred to as the Celtic Shelf, part of the continental shelf of Europe. The northeast portion has a depth of between , increasing towards Saint George&#x27;s Channel. In the opposite direction, sand ridges pointing southwest have a similar height, separated by troughs approximately deeper. These ridges were formed by tidal effects when the sea level was lower. South of 50°N, the topography is more irregular.

Oil and gas exploration in the Celtic Sea has had limited commercial success. The Kinsale Head gas field supplied much of Ireland&#x27;s demand for gas in the 1980s and 1990s. The water is too deep for fixed wind turbines. The area has potential for 50 GW of floating wind farms, and TotalEnergies plans a project with almost 100 MW.

==Ecology==
The Celtic Sea has a rich fishery with total annual catches of 1.8 million tonnes as of 2007.

Four cetacean species occur frequently: minke whale, bottlenose dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin and harbor porpoise. Formerly, it held an abundance of marine mammals.

==Limits==

There are no land features to divide the Celtic Sea from the open Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. For these limits, Holt suggested the marine contour and the island of Ushant off the tip of Brittany.

The definition approved in 1974 by the UK Hydrographer of the Navy for use in Admiralty Charts was &quot;bounded roughly by lines joining Ushant, Land&#x27;s End, Hartland Point, Lundy Island, St. Govan&#x27;s Head and Rosslare, thence following the Irish coast south to Mizen Head and then along the 200-metre isobath to approximately the latitude of Ushant.&quot;

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Celtic Sea as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; The Southern limit of the Irish Sea [a line joining St David&#x27;s Head to Carnsore Point], the South coast of Ireland, thence from Mizen Head a line drawn to a position .

&quot;On the West and South.&quot; A line from the position South to 49°N, thence to latitude 46°30&#x27;N on the Western limit of the Bay of Biscay [a line joining Cape Ortegal to Penmarch Point], thence along that line to Penmarch Point.

&quot;On the East.&quot; The Western limit of the English Channel [a line joining Île Vierge to Land&#x27;s End] and the Western limit of the Bristol Channel [a line joining Hartland Point to St. Govan&#x27;s Head].

<text>Carpe Jugulum (; Latatian for &quot;go for the throat&quot;, cf. &quot;Carpe diem&quot;) is a comic fantasy novel by English writer Terry Pratchett, the twenty-third in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It was first published in 1998.

In &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, Terry Pratchett pastiches the traditions of vampire literature, playing with the mythic archetypes and featuring a tongue-in-cheek reversal of &#x27;vampyre&#x27; subculture with young vampires who wear bright clothes, drink wine, and stay up until noon.

==Plot summary==
Count Magpyr and family, vampires from Überwald, are invited to the naming of Magrat and King Verence&#x27;s daughter, to be conducted by the Omnian priest, the Quite Reverend Mightily-Praiseworthy-Are-Ye-Who-Exalteth-Om &#x27;Mightily&#x27; Oats, a recent graduate from theological college. During the party after the ceremony, Verence tells Nanny Ogg and Agnes Nitt that the Count has informed him that the Magpyr family intend to move into Lancre Castle and take over. Due to a type of hypnotism, everyone seems to consider this plan to be perfectly acceptable. Only the youngest witch, Agnes, and Mightily Oats seem able to resist the vampiric mind control, due to their being &quot;in two minds about everything&quot; (resulting from her Perdita persona, and his contemplation of the tenets of the myriad schismatic sects of Omnianism). Because of her ability to resist his influence, the Magpyr son, Vlad, is attracted to Agnes and makes many advances on her including trying to convince her to become a vampire. Meanwhile, the castle falconer Hodgesaargh goes out searching for a phoenix after discovering a phoenix feather.

Meanwhile, Granny Weatherwax, feeling slighted by not receiving an invitation to the ceremony, has left her cottage empty and seems to be working towards a life in a cave, almost like a hermit. After they have left the hypnotic influence of the Vampires, Agnes, Nanny Ogg and Magrat attempt to convince her to help them save Lancre, but apparently without success, even after Granny is informed that her gilt-edged invitation was stolen by a magpie.

The three witches return to Lancre to take on the Count and his family without her, but because the Magpyr family have built up a tolerance for the normal methods of defeating a vampire, such as garlic, bright light, and religious symbols, this is not so easily done. Just when it seems all is lost, Granny Weatherwax comes through the front door, soaked to the bone and swaying with exhaustion. Nanny Ogg and Magrat use Granny&#x27;s assault upon the Count as a distraction to escape, leaving Granny, Agnes and Brother Oats with the Vampires. Granny is unable to get through the Count&#x27;s mental defences, and the Magpyrs feed on her, with the intention of transforming her into a vampire. Nanny attempts to organise resistance against the Magpyrs, rallying her extended family to form a mob, and promising the Nac Mac Feegle (a race of six-inch-high, blue-skinned militant fairy folk evicted from Überwald by the Magpyrs as an &quot;outdated&quot; race) an uninhabited island in exchange for an alliance against the Magpyrs.

Igor, the servant of the Magpyrs, is hated by the Magpyrs for his traditionalist &quot;more gothic than thou&quot; attitude, as Igor tries to keep the &quot;tradithionalitht&quot; ways alive often against the wishes of the modern current Count Magpyr, including forcing spiders to spin cobwebs. Igor has a pet dog named Scraps, made from the parts of several dogs.

Nanny Ogg, Magrat, and Magrat&#x27;s infant daughter, Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre, escape with the help of the rebelling Igor (who appears to have a crush on Nanny), but are forced to detour to Überwald and end up in the Magpyrs&#x27; castle. Agnes is kidnapped by the Magpyrs&#x27; son and their clan, who give chase by flying. After being taken to the village of Escrow where the Magpyrs have established a means of feeding similar to tax-gathering, Agnes instigates a rebellion against the Vampires.

Granny Weatherwax struggles against the vampirism inside her and thrusts the pain this causes into the iron of the castle forge&#x27;s anvil. She is only able to defeat the vampirism after she looks inside herself and faces the darker side of her nature, but the struggle leaves her barely able to stand, let alone defeat the Count. Granny also surmises that there was a phoenix in the mews the entire times Hodgesaargh was out searching for one, having taken the shape of a hawk (having hatched amongst them).

While Magrat and her daughter hide in Igor&#x27;s dungeon quarters, Nanny and Igor begin fighting against the Magpyrs, using the considerable stock of Holy water and other religious symbols that were originally collected by old Count Magpyr (who is described as having been &quot;a sportsman&quot;). Surprisingly (for the Magpyr family, at least), the old-fashioned ways to defeat vampires that they thought themselves protected against start to work again (with conditioning against religious symbols resulting in the recognition of such in any random pattern). They don&#x27;t understand what the problem is, although they start to have bizarre cravings for &quot;hot, sweet strong tea and biscuits&quot;, a combination that has them feeling quite upset (it not being their usual craving for blood).

All is revealed when Granny (who has &quot;helped&quot; Mightily Oats to Überwald by being carried by him), tells them that — far from turning her into a Vampire — they have, instead, been &#x27;Weatherwaxed&#x27;; she had magically &quot;Borrowed&quot; her own blood, which they drank, allowing her past their mental defences. The Magpyrs find themselves unable to harm Magrat&#x27;s daughter, or do anything else that Granny herself is unable to do (e.g. fly). They are even more horrified when they find out that Igor has re-awakened the old Count Magpyr (having gone into his crypt and spilled a drop of blood on the old Count&#x27;s cremated ashes), and that the people of Überwald would prefer the old Count to their new, modern type of vampirism. Oats gives the new Count a mortal wound across the neck with an axe (though for vampires, mortal wounds aren&#x27;t necessarily the end), and the old Count is left to teach the two young Magpyrs (Lacrimosa and Vlad) the &quot;old ways.&quot; The three vampires are last seen turning into a flock of magpies and disappearing into the darkness of the castle roof. The novel ends with Nanny organising her relatives to attend a sermon by Oats, as he plans to travel to Überwald continue his missionary work; before he leaves, King Verence presents him with an axe-shaped pendant (replacing his Omnian turtle pendant which he lost earlier), and Agnes presents him with a poultice for his facial boil.

<text>The BMD-2 is a Soviet airborne infantry fighting vehicle, introduced in 1985. It is a variant of BMD-1 with a new turret and changes to the hull. BMD stands for &quot;Boyevaya Mashina Desanta&quot; (Боевая Машина Десанта, which literally translates to &quot;Airborne Combat Vehicle&quot;).

It was developed as a replacement for the BMD-1 but did not supersede it entirely in Soviet service. Its NATO designation is BMD M1981/1.

==Development==
When the Soviet–Afghan War broke out, the Soviet forces operated BMP-1 IFVs and BMD-1 airborne IFVs. They were both armed with a 73 mm 2A28 Grom low-pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun, a 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing the 9M14 Malyutka, the 9M14M Malyutka-M and the 9M14P Malyutka-P ATGMs and a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun. This armament was effective against soft targets such as unarmoured vehicles, infantry, and lightly fortified positions, but was not effective in the anti-tank role, and suffered in mountainous terrain due to the low elevation angle of the main gun.

In 1981 the units fighting in Afghanistan started receiving new BMP-2 IFVs. Its 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon with two-belt loading system and high elevation angle addressed the drawbacks of the 73 mm 2A28 gun. The 9S428 ATGM launcher was replaced by a pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher with semi-automatic control.

It was now capable of firing the SACLOS-guided 9M113 Konkurs, the 9M113M Konkurs-M, the 9M111 Fagot and the 9M111-2 Fagot ATGMs, which proved to be much more effective and reliable than the older missiles. The Soviet airborne forces command decided to arm their units with similar vehicles.

In the beginning it became obvious that the hull of BMD-1 was too small for the BMP-2 turret. Therefore, it was decided to design two vehicles. The first was supposed to satisfy the immediate need for a new airborne IFV by modifying the BMD-1/BMP-1 turret, arming it with the same armament as the one on the BMP-2 and then fitting it onto the BMD-1 hull. The second vehicle was intended to be much bigger to allow fitting of the BMP-2 turret and later became the BMD-3.

The modernised variant of the BMD-1 was developed in 1983 and incorporated the new B-30 turret armed with a 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon, a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun and a pintle-mounted 9P135M ATGM launcher. It entered production in 1985.

==Description==
===Overview===

The BMD-2 has a slightly modernized BMD-1 hull and a new turret.

===Crew===

The crew of the BMD-2 is the same as that in the BMD-1. The commander received the R-123M radio set for communication.

The new turret seats the gunner on the left hand side of the main gun. On top of the turret there is one single piece circular hatch opening to the front. Located in front of the hatch is the gunner&#x27;s sight which is the same one as the one used in BMP-2. Another gunner&#x27;s sight is located on the left hand side of the main gun and moves in vertical planes along with it. It is a high angle of fire sight used when the gunner is aiming at air targets. The vehicle has additional periscopes that provide it with vision on the sides. A white searchlight is mounted in front of the turret.

===Turret===
The B-30 turret is a modified version of the BMP-1/BMD-1 turret.

===Armament===
The vehicle is armed with a stabilized 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun. The vehicle carries 300 rounds for the main gun (180 AP and 120 HE) and 2,940 rounds for the machine gun. The main gun can be elevated or depressed between 85° and −5° and can be used to fire at air targets.

The turret is armed with a pintle-mounted 9P135M ATGM launcher. It is capable of firing 9M113 &quot;Konkurs&quot;, 9M113M &quot;Konkurs-M&quot;, 9M111 &quot;Fagot&quot; and 9M111-M &quot;Faktoria&quot; ATGMs.

===Maneuverability===
The BMD-2 has the same engine and same suspension as the BMD-1, with a maximum road operational range of 450 km.

===Air-drop techniques===

The vehicle can be transported by An-12, An-22, Il-76, An-124 airplanes and Mi-6 and Mi-26 helicopters.

A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was developed to ensure the vehicle&#x27;s safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet.

As soon as the rods touch the ground a retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6 m/s and 7 m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing. It allowed a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. This system entered service in 1975 for the BMD-1, and was always used for the BMD-2 afterwards.

===Amphibious ability===

The BMD-2 is fully amphibious. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the two piece trim vane which improves vehicle&#x27;s stability and displacement in water and prevents the water from flooding the bow of the tank. The driver switches the periscope to a swimming periscope that enables the driver to see over the trim vane.

===Armour protection===
The aluminium armour thickness is 7 mm on the turret, 15 mm on the front of the hull and 10 mm on the rest of the hull. The hull&#x27;s front armour has two sections: upper and lower. The upper section is angled at 78° while the lower one is angled at 50°. It is resistant to small arms fire and shrapnel.

===Troop compartment===

The design was made in order to save necessary weight, and sacrifices crew comfort. Like the BMD-1, the BMD-2 has an extremely cramped interior space. It is much smaller than the BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFV&#x27;s. It can carry five infantrymen, including the vehicle commander, bow machine gunner and three soldiers seated behind the turret.

It is equipped with periscope vision blocks on the sides and rear of the vehicle. There are three firing ports, two on each side of the hull and one in the rear.

===Equipment===
The BMD-2 has the same equipment as the BMD-1, except for the R-123 radio set which was replaced by the R-123M radio set.

==Service history==

The BMD-2 entered service with Soviet airborne forces in 1985. They took part in the Soviet–Afghan War. Later they were used by Russian airborne units of SFOR including the Russian airborne brigade stationed in Tojsici which supported Operation Joint Guard.

It is used by Russian airborne units stationed in Abkhazia. BMD-2’s were employed by the Russian 234th Airborne Assault Regiment in the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, with one being lost in action.

===War in the Donbas===

During the war in Donbas, BMD-2s were used by units of the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces, and by separatists of Novorossiya. Ukrainian Airborne BMD-2’s were some of the first armored vehicles destroyed in the conflict. At least one BMD-2 was reported to have been used by separatists while they were besieged in the city of Sloviansk, and others separatist BMD-2’s were recorded in action.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
The BMD-2 has been used by Russian airborne forces in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After Russian forces failed to capture Kyiv, British journalist Mark Urban suggested the BMD-2 and other &quot;armoured vehicles designed to be light enough to be carried on planes do not give much protection from enemy fire.&quot; As of 6 February 2025, the open-source intelligence site, Oryx has visually confirmed the loss of 360 Russian BMD-2s (276 destroyed, 7 damaged, 22 abandoned and 55 captured).

==Variants==
* BMD-2 (Ob&#x27;yekt 916) – Basic model.
** BMD-2K (K stands for komandirskaya – command) – Command variant fitted with an additional antennae.
** BMD-2K-AU – BMD-2K modernisation, with new communication and command equipment.
** BMD-2M – BMD-2 modernisation, with the original turret replaced by the &quot;Bereg&quot; combat module. The main armament is similar to that of the non-upgraded BMD-2, with a 2A42 cannon with 300 rounds, and a PKTM machine gun. However, the original missile system is replaced by two launchers for 9M133 Kornet missiles. A new fire-control system is installed, with a new sight including a thermal channel, a laser rangefinder, a new ballistic computer coupled with a meteorological sensor and with automatic target tracking, and a new stabiliser. A new radio is installed, and three smoke grenade launchers are added.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
*About 849 in active service and more than 1,500 in storage as of 2013. In service as of 2023.
*63 in 1995 and 78 in 2000 and 2005.

===Former operators===
*Passed on to successor states.

<text>In chemistry, a polyoxometalate (abbreviated POM) is a polyatomic ion, usually an anion, that consists of three or more transition metal oxyanions linked together by shared oxygen atoms to form closed 3-dimensional frameworks. The metal atoms are usually group 6 (Mo, W) or less commonly group 5 (V, Nb, Ta) and group 7 (Tc, Re) transition metals in their high oxidation states. Polyoxometalates are often colorless, orange or red diamagnetic anions. Two broad families are recognized, isopolymetalates, composed of only one kind of metal and oxide, and heteropolymetalates, composed of one or more metals, oxide, and eventually a main group oxyanion (phosphate, silicate, etc.). Many exceptions to these general statements exist.

==Formation==
The oxides of d0 metals such as , , dissolve at high pH to give orthometalates, , , . For and , the nature of the dissolved species at high pH is less clear, but these oxides also form polyoxometalates. 
As the pH is lowered, orthometalates protonate to give oxide–hydroxide compounds such as and . These species condense via the process called olation. The replacement of terminal M=O bonds, which in fact have triple bond character, is compensated by the increase in coordination number. The nonobservation of polyoxochromate cages is rationalized by the small radius of Cr(VI), which may not accommodate octahedral coordination geometry.

Condensation of the species entails loss of water and the formation of linkages. The stoichiometry for hexamolybdate is shown:

An abbreviated condensation sequence illustrated with vanadates is:
:

When such acidifications are conducted in the presence of phosphate or silicate, heteropolymetalate result. For example, the phosphotungstate anion consists of a framework of twelve octahedral tungsten oxyanions surrounding a central phosphate group.

==History==

Ammonium phosphomolybdate, anion, was reported in 1826. The isostructural phosphotungstate anion was characterized by X-ray crystallography 1934. This structure is called the Keggin structure after its discoverer.

The 1970s witnessed the introduction of quaternary ammonium salts of POMs. This innovation enabled systematic study without the complications of hydrolysis and acid/base reactions. The introduction of 17O NMR spectroscopy allowed the structural characterization of POMs in solution.

Ramazzoite, the first example of a mineral with a polyoxometalate cation, was described in 2016 in Mt. Ramazzo Mine, Liguria, Italy.

==Structure and bonding==
The typical framework building blocks are polyhedral units, with 6-coordinate metal centres. Usually, these units share edges and/or vertices. The coordination number of the oxide ligands varies according to their location in the cage. Surface oxides tend to be terminal or doubly bridging oxo ligands. Interior oxides are typically triply bridging or even octahedral. POMs are sometimes viewed as soluble fragments of metal oxides.

Recurring structural motifs allow POMs to be classified. &quot;Iso&quot;-polyoxometalates (isopolyanions) feature octahedral metal centers. The heteropolymetalates form distinct structures because the main group center is usually tetrahedral. The Lindqvist and Keggin structures are common motifs for iso- and heteropolyanions, respectively.

Polyoxometalates typically exhibit coordinate metal-oxo bonds of different multiplicity and strength. In a typical POM such as the Keggin structure , each addenda center connects to single terminal oxo ligand, four bridging μ2-O ligands and one bridging μ3-O deriving from the central heterogroup. Metal–metal bonds in polyoxometalates are normally absent and owing to this property, F. Albert Cotton opposed to consider polyoxometalates as form of cluster materials. However, metal-metal bonds are not completely absent in polyoxometalates and they are often present among the highly reduced species.

===Polymolybdates and tungstates===
The polymolybdates and polytungstates are derived, formally at least, from the dianionic [MO4]2- precursors. The most common units for polymolybdates and polyoxotungstates are the octahedral {MO6} centers, sometimes slightly distorted. Some polymolybdates contain pentagonal bipyramidal units. These building blocks are found in the molybdenum blues, which are mixed valence compounds.

===Polyoxotechnetates and rhenates===
Polyoxotechnetates form only in strongly acidic conditions, such as in  or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid solutions. The first empirically isolated polyoxotechnetate was the red . It contains both Tc(V) and Tc(VII) in ratio 4: 16 and is obtained as the hydronium salt by concentrating an solution. Corresponding ammonium polyoxotechnetate salt was recently isolated from trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and it has very similar structure.
The only polyoxorhenate formed in acidic conditions in presence of pyrazolium cation. The first empirically isolated polyoxorhenate was the white . It contains Re(VII) in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination.

Mixed polyoxo(technetate-rhenate) [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2- polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII)were also isolated and structurally characterized.

=== Polyoxotantalates, niobates, and vanadates ===
The polyniobates, polytantalates, and vanadates are derived, formally at least, from highly charged [MO4]3- precursors. For Nb and Ta, most common members are (M = Nb, Ta), which adopt the Lindqvist structure. These octaanions form in strongly basic conditions from alkali melts of the extended metal oxides (M2O5), or in the case of Nb even from mixtures of niobic acid and alkali metal hydroxides in aqueous solution. The hexatantalate can also be prepared by condensation of peroxotantalate in alkaline media. These polyoxometalates display an anomalous aqueous solubility trend of their alkali metal salts inasmuch as their Cs+ and Rb+ salts are more soluble than their Na+ and Li+ salts. The opposite trend is observed in group 6 POMs.

The decametalates with the formula (M = Nb, Ta) are isostructural with decavanadate. They are formed exclusively by edge-sharing {MO6} octahedra (the structure of decatungstate comprises edge-sharing and corner-sharing tungstate octahedra).

===Heteroatoms===

Heteroatoms aside from the transition metal are a defining feature of heteropolymetalates. Many different elements can serve as heteroatoms but most common are , , and .

===Giant structures===

Polyoxomolybdates include the wheel-shaped molybdenum blue anions and spherical keplerates. The cluster consists of more than 700 atoms and is the size of a small protein. The anion is in the form of a tire (the cavity has a diameter of more than 20 Å) and an extremely large inner and outer surface. The incorporation of lanthanide ions in molybdenum blues is particularly intriguing. Lanthanides can behave like Lewis acids and perform catalytic properties. Lanthanide-containing polyoxometalates show chemoselectivity and are also able to form inorganic–organic adducts, which can be exploited in chiral recognition.

===Oxoalkoxometalates ===
Oxoalkoxometalates are clusters that contain both oxide and alkoxide ligands. Typically they lack terminal oxo ligands. Examples include the dodecatitanate Ti12O16(OPri)16 (where OPri stands for an alkoxy group), the iron oxoalkoxometalates and iron and copper Keggin ions.

===Sulfido, imido, and other &quot;O&quot;-replaced oxometalates===
The terminal oxide centers of polyoxometalate framework can in certain cases be replaced with other ligands, such as S2−, Br−, and NR2−. Sulfur-substituted POMs are called &quot;polyoxothiometalates&quot;. Other ligands replacing the oxide ions have also been demonstrated, such as nitrosyl and alkoxy groups.

Polyfluoroxometalate are yet another class of O-replaced oxometalates.

===Other===
Numerous hybrid organic–inorganic materials that contain POM cores,

Illustrative of the diverse structures of POM is the ion , which has face-shared octahedra with Mo atoms at the vertices of an icosahedron.

==Use and aspirational applications==
===Oxidation catalysts===
POMs are employed as commercial catalysts for oxidation of organic compounds.

Efforts continue to extend this theme. POM-based aerobic oxidations have been promoted as alternatives to chlorine-based wood pulp bleaching processes, a method of decontaminating water, and a method to catalytically produce formic acid from biomass (OxFA process). Polyoxometalates have been shown to catalyse water splitting.

===Molecular electronics===
Some POMs exhibit unusual magnetic properties, which has prompted visions of many applications. One example is storage devices called qubits. non-volatile (permanent) storage components, also known as flash memory devices.

===Drugs===
Potential antitumor and antiviral drugs. The Anderson-type polyoxomolybdates and heptamolybdates exhibit activity for suppressing the growth of some tumors. In the case of (NH3Pr)6[Mo7O24], activity appears related to its redox properties. The Wells-Dawson structure can efficiently inhibit amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation in a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. antibacterial and antiviral uses.

<doc id="623489" wikidata="Q953812" url="?curid=623489" title="Germanía">
<text>Germanía () is the Spanish term for the argot used by criminals or in jails in Spain during 16th and 17th centuries. Its purpose is to keep outsiders out of the conversation. The ultimate origin of the word is the Latin word , through Catalan (brother) and (&quot;brotherhood, guild&quot;).

Some documentation for it occurs in picaresque works as early as the Spanish Golden Century, such as in Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;El Buscón&quot;. Some writers used it in poetry for comical effect.

After the arrival of the Romani people and their frequent imprisonment, &quot;germanía&quot; incorporated much vocabulary from Romany and its descendant, the &quot;caló&quot; jargon. As time passed, several words entered popular use and even standard Spanish, losing their value for secrecy. &quot;Germanía&quot; survives today in the &quot;cheli&quot; jargon.

==War of the Germanías==

The term germanía (&quot;brotherhood&quot; in Catalan—compare with Galician &quot;irmandade&quot; and Spanish &quot;hermandad&quot;) originated from the name of a revolt against the local nobility in Valencia, Spain during the sixteenth century. Subsequently, the term referred to the argot used by these communities and, eventually, it referred to improper argot.

==Use in literature==
Characters in the original Spanish version of Arturo Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s Captain Alatriste series make use of germanía. Pérez-Reverte gave a speech on the subject of germanía to the Real Academia Española de la Lengua after they invited him to join the academy for the work he had done on the series.

<doc id="623491" wikidata="Q318479" url="?curid=623491" title="Abel Muzorewa">
<text>Abel Tendekayi Muzorewa (14 April 1925 – 8 April 2010), also commonly referred to as Bishop Muzorewa, was a Zimbabwean bishop and politician who served as the first and only Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia from the Internal Settlement to the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979. A United Methodist Church bishop and nationalist leader, he held office for less than a year.

==Early life==
Muzorewa was the eldest of a lay preacher&#x27;s five children and was educated at the United Methodist School, Old Umtali, near Mutare. He was a school teacher at Mrewa between 1943 and 1947 before becoming a full-time lay preacher at Mtoko between 1947 and 1949. He then studied theology at Old Umtali Biblical College (1949–1952) and was ordained a Minister at Umtali in August 1953. He was a pastor at Chiduku, near Rusape, from 1955 to 1958.

Muzorewa attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri, later Central Methodist University. By then he had a wife and three sons, who lived with him in prefabricated student housing, while his sons attended a segregated school. His youngest son Wesley and playmate Mark Elrod (son of the college librarian J. McRee Elrod) attempted to integrate the ice cream counter of the local drug store, but were turned away.

When Elrod took Muzorewa to visit Scarritt College for Christian Workers in Nashville, Tennessee, they were turned away from an eating facility, an incident he mentions in his autobiography. However, he later graduated as a Master of Arts from Scarritt (now a conference center).

In July 1963, Muzorewa became pastor of Old Umtali. A year later he was appointed National Director of the Christian Youth Movement and was seconded to the Christian Council. In 1966, he became Secretary of the Student Christian Movement. In 1968, at Masera in Botswana, he was consecrated as the United Methodist Church&#x27;s Bishop of Rhodesia.

== Political career ==

===United African National Council===
In 1971 the British government struck a deal with Ian Smith that provided for a transition to &quot;majority rule&quot; in exchange for an end to sanctions against the government. Muzorewa joined an inexperienced cleric, the Reverend Canaan Banana, to form the United African National Council (UANC) to oppose the settlement, under the acronym NIBMAR (no independence before majority rule).

The proposed referendum was withdrawn and Muzorewa found himself a national leader and an international personality. The government opposition movements—the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) of Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) of Joshua Nkomo—both placed themselves under the UANC umbrella even though they had some doubts when Muzorewa founded a national party.

After ZANU (led by Robert Mugabe after disagreements with Sithole) and ZAPU undertook guerrilla warfare, the UANC was the only legal black party, since it rejected violence.

===Internal Settlement===
On 3 March 1978, Muzorewa, Sithole and other non-exiled leaders signed an agreement at Government House, Salisbury, which paved the way for the interim government, the leadership of which was an Executive Council made up of Muzorewa, Sithole and Jeremiah Chirau, along with Ian Smith.

This Executive Council was to run the affairs of state prior to elections taking place. A new constitution was drafted reserving 10 seats in the Senate and 28 seats in the House of Assembly for the white minority, and a quarter of the Cabinet positions. The constitution was approved in a nearly whites-only referendum that took place in January 1979. An overwhelming majority of 85% voted yes.

Elections were held, and the UANC won. Josiah Gumede was the first President, Muzorewa became prime minister and the country&#x27;s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. However, the war that Smith hoped to stem as a result of the settlement continued unabated. Mugabe and Nkomo rejected the settlement, ending any realistic chance for Muzorewa to gain any international legitimacy. While ZANU and ZAPU could have taken part in the elections if they laid down their arms, they refused to do so. The internal settlement was also condemned by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 423 of 1978, which declared any settlement drafted under the &quot;illegal racist minority regime&quot; to be &quot;illegal and unacceptable.&quot;

===Lancaster House Agreement===
The British government asked all parties to come to London for negotiations to find a lasting solution to the Bush War. Nkomo and Mugabe attended the conference under the &quot;Patriotic Front&quot; (PF) banner. The conference was held from 10 September to 15 December 1979, under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary. Muzorewa was persuaded to accept fresh elections, to be held in early 1980. In accordance with the final agreement, Muzorewa&#x27;s government revoked the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 December 1979 and dissolved itself. As part of a transition to internationally recognised independence, the country once again became the British colony of Southern Rhodesia pending elections.

Parliamentary elections took place at the end of February 1980, after a campaign filled with much intimidation by Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU. The British government briefly considered disqualifying ZANU from participating in the elections for flagrant violation of the Lancaster House Agreement, but in the end did nothing. On 4 March 1980, the elections resulted in a majority for Mugabe and ZANU. The UANC won only three out of 80 seats reserved for Africans in the House of Assembly. Under Mugabe, &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot; became the Republic of Zimbabwe, or &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;.

===Visit to Israel, arrest and hunger strike===
Muzorewa visited Israel on 21 October 1983. He urged Mugabe to establish diplomatic relations, saying his political policies hurt Zimbabwe&#x27;s agriculture and technology industries. The Zimbabwean government arrested Muzorewa on 1 November on charges of conspiring against Mugabe for the South African government. Two days later Mugabe warned Ndabaningi Sithole and Joshua Nkomo against &#x27;conspiring&#x27;. Muzorewa then went on a hunger strike, which lasted from 3 to 11 November.

===1996 and 2008 presidential elections===
Muzorewa stood against Mugabe in the presidential election of 1996, but pulled out after the Supreme Court turned down his bid to postpone the elections on the basis that the electoral rules were unfair (as state funds were only available to parties with 15 or more seats in parliament). He remained on the ballot and won 4.8% of the popular vote.

On 21 June 2007, Muzorewa said citizens, black and white alike, came to his house and asked him to run for president. He said Zimbabwe was &quot;bleeding, economically and socially. It is painful to listen to them talk.&quot; He asked people to pray that negotiations between ZANU-PF and the MDC, mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, would be successful and for Zimbabwe&#x27;s &quot;salvation.&quot; Ultimately Muzorewa did not run in the 2008 presidential election.

==Death and burial==
Muzorewa died aged 84 from cancer at his home in Harare on 8 April 2010. The Director of Christian Care, Reverend Forbes Matonga, described Muzorewa&#x27;s legacy as including &quot;his role in the country&#x27;s transition to independence, the Methodist Church and the founding of Africa University in the eastern Zimbabwean city of Mutare&quot;. Political commentator John Makumbe said Muzorewa&#x27;s legacy in Zimbabwe would be that of &quot;a man of peace&quot;.

Bishop Muzorewa and his wife are buried at the Old Mutare Mission Station, Mutare, Manicaland Province.

<text>Irving Wallace (March 19, 1916 – June 29, 1990) was an American best-selling author and screenwriter. He was known for his heavily researched novels, many with a sexual theme.

==Early life==
Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Bessie Liss and Alexander Wallace (an Americanized version of the original family name of Wallechinsky). The family was Jewish and originally from Russia. Wallace was named after his maternal grandfather, a bookkeeper and Talmudic scholar of Narewka, Poland. Wallace grew up at 6103 Eighteenth Avenue in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he attended Kenosha Central High School. He was the father of Olympic historian David Wallechinsky and author Amy Wallace.

==Career==
Wallace began selling stories to magazines when he was a teenager. In the Second World War Wallace served in the Frank Capra unit in Fort Fox along with Theodor Seuss Geisel – better known as Dr. Seuss – and continued to write for magazines. He also served in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force. Soon, however, Wallace turned to a more lucrative job as a Hollywood screenwriter. He collaborated on such films as &quot;The West Point Story&quot; (1950), &quot;Split Second&quot; (1953), &quot;Meet Me at the Fair&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Big Circus&quot; (1959). He also contributed three scripts to the western television program &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;.

After an unsatisfying stint in Hollywood, he devoted himself full-time to writing books. He published his first non-fiction work in 1955, &quot;The Fabulous Originals&quot;, and his first fiction offering, &quot;The Sins of Philip Fleming&quot;, in 1959. The latter, ignored by critics, was followed by the enormously successful &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;. Wallace published 33 books during his lifetime, translated into 31 languages.

Irving Wallace was married to Sylvia (née Kahn) Wallace, a former magazine writer and editor. Her first novel, &quot;The Fountains&quot;, was an American best-seller and published in twelve foreign editions. Her second novel, &quot;Empress&quot;, was published in 1980. She also helped him to produce, along with their two children, &quot;The Book of Lists#2&quot; and &quot;The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People&quot;. In her autobiography, Amy Wallace wrote that her mother&#x27;s contributions were not always helpful and the atmosphere not always harmonious. Sylvia Wallace died October 20, 2006, at age 89.

Several of Wallace&#x27;s books have been made into films, including &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;, &quot;The Man&quot;, &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot; and &quot;New Delhi&quot;. Also among his best-known books are &quot;The Prize&quot; (1962), &quot;The Word&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Fan Club&quot; (1974).

Michael Korda and Peter Schwed were the editors for Wallace at Simon &amp; Schuster. In his autobiography &quot;Another Life&quot;, Korda suggests that Wallace invented a style of novel that is at once a strong story and encyclopedia, with &quot;some sex thrown in to keep the reader&#x27;s pulse going.&quot;

With his son, daughter and wife he produced some notable non-fiction works, including three editions each of &quot;The People&#x27;s Almanac&quot; (with son David) and &quot;The Book of Lists&quot; (with David and Amy and wife Sylvia for the second volume). Wallace used many of the odd facts he uncovered in his novels.

Wallace died of pancreatic cancer on June 29, 1990, at age 74. He was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>A forb or phorb is a herbaceous flowering plant that is not a graminoid (grass, sedge, or rush). The term is used in botany and in vegetation ecology especially in relation to grasslands and understory. Typically, these are eudicots without woody stems.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;forb&quot; is derived from Greek () &#x27;pasture; fodder&#x27;. The Hellenic spelling &quot;phorb&quot; is sometimes used, and in older usage this sometimes includes graminids and other plants currently not regarded as forbs.

==Guilds==
Forbs are members of a guilda group of plant species with broadly similar growth forms. In certain contexts in ecology, guild membership may often be more important than the taxonomic relationships between organisms.

==In informal classification==
In addition to its use in ecology, the term &quot;forb&quot; may be used for subdividing popular guides to wildflowers, distinguishing them from other categories such as grasses, sedges, shrubs, and trees. Some examples of forbs are clovers, sunflowers, daylilies, and milkweed.

Forb Adaptation Zones:
Kale and turnip are examples of forb adaptations distributed over much of Europe, southern Oceania, northern Asia, and northern North America. In cooler climates, these crops are grown year-round, while in warmer climates, they are used as winter forage.

<text>The BT-42 was a Finnish assault gun, constructed during the Continuation War. It was constructed from captured Soviet BT-7 light tanks and British 4.5-inch howitzers (114 mm-calibre light howitzer, model 1908) from 1918, which had been donated during the Winter War. Eighteen vehicles were constructed, yet only 1 survives to this day, housed at the Parola Tank Museum.

==Development and use==
As the Second World War progressed, the Red Army were fielding better and better tanks. The Finnish Army, on the other hand, had to make do with a large number of captured tanks, which were for the most part lightly armored and armed.

The Finns decided to redesign the BT-7 Model 1937 tank. They constructed a new turret fitted with 76 K/02 gun sights and armed it with British-made 114.3 mm howitzers that had been supplied by the British during the Winter War (Q.F. 4,5 inch howitzer Mark II, also known as &quot;114 Psv.H/18&quot; in Finland). Eighteen BT-42 were built and these were pressed into service in 1943.

These converted vehicles quickly became very unpopular with their crews. The weaknesses could mainly be attributed to the new turret, which apart from giving the tank a high-profile also added significant weight to the vehicle, stressing the suspension and the engine.

The BT-42 was used for the first time in 1943, at the Svir River, where it was used against enemy pillboxes. The design worked reasonably well against soft targets but was completely unsuitable for anti-tank warfare.

The BT-42 ended up ultimately failing at the original goal to have some sort of domestic armour production to combat the Soviet one this being realised when the tank became utterly ineffective in tank-tank combat and later replaced with the German lend leased Stug IIIs.

To counter this, the Finns copied a German-designed HEAT round for the gun and it was initially thought that it would be effective against the sloped armour of the T-34. However, problems arose with the copied HEAT shells fuses, which apparently did not arm themselves correctly after firing, due to the different muzzle velocity and round spin rate of the 4.5-inch howitzer compared to the original German guns.

The BT-42s were used again during the major Soviet offensive in 1944. Nine BT-42s were deployed in the defence of Vyborg. In one encounter, a Finnish BT-42 hit a Soviet T-34 eighteen times, failing even to immobilize the enemy vehicle. During this battle a BT-42 was destroyed by a T-34 tank shell. Seven of the BT-42 tanks were also lost due to mechanical failures, resulting in eight of the nine deployed being destroyed. At the time Finnish armoured units were still composed mostly of older designs such as the Vickers 6-Ton, T-26 and T-28 tanks, and all of these suffered losses.

Emergency supplies of Panzer IV tanks and StuG III self-propelled assault guns from Germany made it possible for the Finns to replace their losses with more effective vehicles. The BT-42 was retired soon after the Vyborg battles, replaced in their role with German-made StuG IIIs. Finland also used captured T-34s, as well as receiving more of these vehicles from Germany&#x27;s stock of captured enemy kits.

== &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot; ==
The Parola Tank Museum in Parola, Finland, houses the world&#x27;s last surviving BT-42. The tank was featured as the primary vehicle of Jatkosota High School, a minor school in the Japanese anime &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot;. The museum was seeking funds for an outdoor shelter for several of their tanks, including the BT-42. A large group of Japanese &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot; fans raised over €10,000 in order to help the museum preserve its BT-42.

<text>A celebrity sex tape is typically an amateur pornographic video recording involving one or more famous people which has, intentionally or unintentionally, been made available publicly. Such videos have often been released without the consent of their subjects and have damaged (or enhanced) celebrities&#x27; careers. In 1988, for example, a sex tape caused significant damage to Rob Lowe&#x27;s career.

The surfacing of sex tapes has become so common that some are &quot;leaked&quot; as a marketing tool to advance or establish a media career. A celebrity can fight the release in court to maintain deniability while still enjoying the career benefits. Alternatively, a celebrity may take the route of openly releasing the tape and benefitting directly from royalties as well as indirectly from the publicity. The public acceptance of celebrities with sex tapes is speculated by Joe Levy, executive editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, to be due to the easy availability of pornography, as well as couples more commonly making their own tapes due to the prevalence of video cameras.

Under a controversial anti-pornography law that came into effect in Indonesia in 2008, defendants can face up to twelve years in prison, even if the court determines they never intended the videos to be leaked to the public. The video would have resulted in his prosecution under a law banning adultery, owing to Cut Tari having been married at the time the video was made in 2006.

=== K ===
* Kim Kardashian made a sex tape with her then boyfriend Ray J in October 2003. The video—called &quot;Kim Kardashian, Superstar&quot;—was leaked in 2007.

<text>Urvashi Vaid (October 8, 1958 – May 14, 2022) was an Indian-born American LGBT rights activist, lawyer, and writer. An expert in gender and sexuality law, she was a consultant in attaining specific goals of social justice. She held a series of roles at the National LGBTQ Task Force, serving as executive director from 1989-1992 — the first woman of color to lead a national gay-and-lesbian organization. She is the author of &quot;Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation&quot; (1995) and &quot;Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics&quot; (2012).

==Early life and education==
Urvashi Vaid was born on October 8, 1958, in New Delhi, India to writer Krishna Baldev Vaid and poet and painter Champa née Bali Vaid. She was one of three daughters and moved to Potsdam, New York, in 1966 with her family after her father took a teaching position at State University of New York at Potsdam. She was politically active at a young age, writing letters to Richard Nixon in support of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, participating in anti-Vietnam War marches, and giving speeches during George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign. 

Vaid graduated from Potsdam High School in three years, in 1975, and attended Vassar College, where she studied English literature and political science. At Vassar, she was active in a variety of political and social causes, including co-founding the Feminist Union on campus (in the context of Vassar&#x27;s recent transition to coed) and participating in activism against apartheid. She graduated in 1979. After graduating from Vassar, Vaid moved to Boston, where she interned briefly at the Women&#x27;s Prison Project and worked as legal secretary before beginning law school at the Northeastern University School of Law. She was politically active while living in Boston, co-founding the Allston-Brighton Greenlight Safehouse Network, a neighborhood anti-violence project, as well as the Boston Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance with Eric Rofes. She was also involved with Lesbians United in Non-Nuclear Action (LUNA), the Boston Food Co-op, the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD), and the Boston Pride March committee. While attending Northeastern, she also worked as a writer at the &quot;Gay Community News.&quot; She received her Juris Doctor degree from Northeastern in 1983.

==Career==
From 1983 to 1986, Vaid was staff attorney at the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), where she initiated the organization&#x27;s work on HIV/AIDS in prisons. For more than ten years, Vaid worked in various capacities at the National LGBTQ Task Force (NGLTF), the oldest national LGBT civil rights organization; first as its media director, then as executive director (1989–1992), and as director of its Policy Institute think-tank. While executive director, Vaid disrupted a presidential press conference being made by George H. W. Bush with a sign &quot;Talk Is Cheap, AIDS Funding Is Not&quot;; she also co-founded the Task Force&#x27;s Creating Change conference. 

Vaid spent ten years working in global philanthropic organizations, serving as executive director of the Arcus Foundation (2005–2010) and deputy director of Governance and Civil Society Unit of the Ford Foundation (2001–2005) as well as serving on the board of the Gill Foundation (2004–2014). She was the Director of the Engaging Tradition Project at the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School from 2011 to 2015. The project focused on the way tradition is used in movements for gender and sexuality to inform, enable or limit the movement. 

Vaid was the founder of LPAC, the first lesbian Super PAC, which was launched in July 2012 and has invested millions of dollars in candidates who are committed to legislation promoting social justice. She was founder of The Vaid Group, a social innovation consultancy that advises individuals and organization working to advance equity, justice and inclusion globally and domestically.

At the time of her death, Vaid was president of the Vaid Group LLC, which worked with social justice innovators, movements, and organizations to address structural inequalities based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race, gender, and economic status.

== Political activism ==
Vaid believed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality will occur only when the larger institutions of society and the family are transformed to be more inclusive of racial, gender, and economic difference. Her book &quot;Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation&quot; (1995) won a Stonewall Book Award in 1996.

Vaid became executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) in 1989. Vaid left NGLTF in December 1992 and wrote &quot;Virtual Equality&quot; (published in 1995). She returned to NGLTF from 1997 to 2001 as the director of its think tank, the NGLTF Policy Institute. 
Vaid worked for five years at the Ford Foundation, and served as executive director of the Arcus Foundation. She served on the board of the Gill Foundation from 2004 to 2014. Upon the death of former president George H.W. Bush in 2018, Vaid, who had been executive director of NGLTF during his presidency, commented on the Bush&#x27;s legacy regarding AIDS, saying: &quot;If one was being charitable one could say it was a mixed legacy, but in truth it was a bad legacy of leadership ... He did not lead on AIDS.&quot;

Vaid was a staunch sexual liberationist. As Richard Burns, who had been the managing editor of the Gay Community News prior to becoming Vaid&#x27;s classmate at Northeastern recalled, &quot;If I told her about a sex club, she wanted to go, too,&quot; Burns said. &quot;And then we did, and then we were thrown out when they discovered she was not a guy. More than once.&quot; A co-worker at the National LGBTQ Task Force remembers in article in the New Yorker, &quot;In 1990, Urvashi gave us a fisting demonstration at our Task Force staff meeting, raising her hand in the air and creating the proper form.&quot;

In April 2009 &quot;Out&quot; magazine named her one of the 50 most influential LGBT people in the United States.

Vaid&#x27;s book &quot;Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics&quot; (2012) critiques the racial and gender bias of the mainstream LGBT movement and continues her argument that engagement with social justice is what will enable all parts of the LGBT community to realize equality and justice. Vaid told &quot;Curve&quot; magazine that her biggest fear was that LGBT communities would get preoccupied by the wins in the fight for marriage equality and slow down their movement. She argued for a more inclusive movement, one that would encompass everyone regardless of race, class, ethnicity, age, or ability.

Vaid hoped that the future of LGBT communities will accomplish two things. &quot;One is to take care of the parts of our community that are less powerful. That means low-income LGBT people, transgender people and our community&#x27;s women, whose rights are getting the crap kicked out of them, parts of our community across the board—kids, old gay people&quot; and &quot;The second thing I would love to see happen is for the LGBT community to use its political power and access to create a more just society for all.&quot;

In a conversation between Vaid and Larry Kramer in 1994, Vaid made an argument for intersectional solidarity within HIV and reproductive issues: &quot;What if we tried to identify how [H.I.V.] treatment issues connect with racism…It’s going to express itself differently in your life than in mine . . . . That’s the issue of reproductive choice. It was never about men should march with women because they support women. It was more that men should march for reproductive freedom because we’re marching against the power of the state to tell you and me what to do sexually . . . If the state can say you can’t have an abortion, the state can say you can’t have sodomy.&quot;

In an article written in 2014 for the Journal of Lesbian Studies, Vaid called for a greater activist response for and by people with breast cancer. &quot;There’s a clear need for an ACT UP type direct action movement organized around diagnosis, treatment, and care for breast cancer,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But they are not organized to mobilize the anger and energy of breast cancer survivors and our families to pressure and demand an improvement in diagnosis technologies, in drug development, in standards of care and treatment, in health insurance coverage, for example.&quot;

Shortly after her death in 2022, Vaid was added to the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor at Stonewall Inn.

==Personal life ==
In 1998, Vaid met political comedian Kate Clinton at a war conference of gay rights activists in Warrenton, Virginia, and the couple married in 2013. She shared homes with Clinton in Manhattan and Provincetown, Massachusetts. 

Vaid died at home from breast cancer on May 14, 2022. She had previously been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Vaid was the aunt of Alok Vaid-Menon, a gender non-conforming writer, performance artist, and media personality.

<text>The Atlantic City Convention Center is a large convention center located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Opened on May 1, 1997, the center includes of showroom space, 5 exhibit halls, 45 meeting rooms with of space, a garage with 1,400 parking spaces, and an adjacent Sheraton hotel.

==History==

The Center was developed as a part of the city&#x27;s gateway redevelopment project, which also included Tanger Outlets The Walk and the Grand Boulevard. The building opened with a connected Sheraton hotel.

The building was constructed in its original design by Philadelphia green city planning firm WRT (Wallace, Roberts and Todd) by its senior architect at the time, the principal, and partner, Gilbert Rosenthal, AIA, to reflect its location, featuring wave-inspired carpets and a Rock Bar themed to the beach. The main lobby is contained within an atrium lit by 90 ft. high skylights.

Between the convention center and the Sheraton Hotel is a landscaped garden with an interactive bronze statue of Bert Parks holding a crown. When a visitor puts their head inside the crown and taps it, sensors activate a recorded playback of Parks singing &quot;There She Is...&quot; through speakers hidden behind nearby bushes.

==Other facilities==
The Center is connected to the Atlantic City Rail Terminal, containing New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line to Philadelphia.

<doc id="623538" wikidata="Q312288" url="?curid=623538" title="George Ellery Hale">
<text>George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 – February 21, 1938) was an American astrophysicist, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory. He played a key role in the foundation of the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research and the National Research Council, and in developing the California Institute of Technology into a leading research university.

==Early life and education==
George Ellery Hale was born on June 29, 1868, in Chicago, Illinois, to William Ellery Hale and Mary Browne. He is descended from Thomas Hale of Watton-on-Stone, Hertfordshire, England, whose son emigrated to America about 1640. His father acquired a considerable fortune manufacturing and installing passenger elevators during the reconstruction of Chicago, which had been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The oldest of three children who lived past childhood, George received strong encouragement from his father, who supported the boy&#x27;s active mind and curiosity, and his mother, who inculcated in him a love of poetry and literature. 

He spent his youth fascinated by the books and machinery given to him by his parents—one of his most prized possessions was a small microscope. With his father&#x27;s encouragement, he built a small shop in their house that turned into a laboratory. The microscope led to his interest in optics. At the age of fourteen, George built his first telescope. His father later replaced it with a second-hand Clark refractor that they mounted on the roof of their Kenwood house. Soon he was photographing the night skies, observing a partial eclipse of the Sun, and drawing sunspots.

As an avid reader with a strong interest in the budding field of astrophysics, Hale was drawn to the writings of William Huggins, Norman Lockyer, and Ernest Rutherford. His fascination with science, however, did not preclude interests more typical of a normal boy, such as fishing, boating, swimming, skating, tennis, and bicycling. He was an enthusiastic reader of the stories of Jules Verne—particularly drawn to the tales of adventure set in the mountains of California. Hale spent summers at his grandmother&#x27;s house in the old New England village of Madison, Connecticut, where he met his future wife, Evelina Conklin. 

After graduating from Oakland Public School in Chicago, Hale attended the Allen Academy, where he studied chemistry, physics, and astronomy. He supplemented his practical home experience by attending a course in shop-work at the Chicago Manual Training School. During these years, Hale developed a knowledge of the principles of architecture and city planning with the help of his father&#x27;s friend, well-known architect Daniel Burnham. Upon Burnham&#x27;s advice and encouragement, Hale decided at the age of seventeen to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Hale was educated at MIT, at the Harvard College Observatory, (1889–90), and in Berlin (1893–94) where he was a PhD student but never finished his degree. At the time he already had an appointment as a professor at the recently established University of Chicago. As an undergraduate at MIT, he is known for inventing the spectroheliograph, with which he made his discovery of solar vortices.

In 1890, he began research at the Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory, which Hale&#x27;s father had built for him; he was professor of astrophysics at Beloit College (1891–93); associate professor at the University of Chicago until 1897, and full professor (1897–1905). He was coeditor of &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;, 1892–95, and after 1895 editor of the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1921 to 1923.

In 1908, he used the Zeeman effect with a modified spectroheliograph to establish that sunspots were magnetic. Subsequent work demonstrated a strong tendency for east-west alignment of magnetic polarities in sunspots, with mirror symmetry across the solar equator; and that the polarity in each hemisphere switched orientation from one sunspot cycle to the next. This systematic property of sunspot magnetic fields is now commonly referred to as the &quot;Hale–Nicholson law,&quot; or in many cases simply &quot;Hale&#x27;s law.&quot; 

Hale spent a large portion of his career trying to find a way to image the solar corona without the benefit of a total solar eclipse, but this was not achieved until the work of Bernard Lyot.
In October 1913, Hale received a letter from Albert Einstein, asking whether certain astronomical observations could be done that would test Einstein&#x27;s hypothesis concerning the effects of gravity on light. Hale replied in November, saying that such observations could be done only during a total eclipse of the Sun.

== Founding and organizing of institutions ==
Hale was a driven individual, who worked to found a number of significant astronomical observatories, including Yerkes Observatory, Mount Wilson Observatory, Palomar Observatory, and the Hale Solar Laboratory. At Mount Wilson, he hired and encouraged Harlow Shapley and Edwin Hubble toward some of the most significant discoveries of the time. He was a prolific organizer who helped create a number of astronomical institutions, societies and journals. Hale also played a central role in developing the California Institute of Technology into a leading research university. After retiring as director at Mount Wilson, he built the Hale Solar Laboratory in Pasadena, California, as his office and workshop, pursuing his interest in the sun.

From early youth, Hale had been internationally oriented, travelling widely throughout Europe in his younger years. Having long realized the value of an international organization to coordinate scientific research, he pursued, as chairman of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences of the US, the formation of an international organization for solar research. The society&#x27;s inaugural meeting was held at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 and included representatives from 16 national scientific societies, but notably not from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which had declined the invitation. Instead, German delegates from the German Physical Society were present.

The delegates proceeded to appoint a committee that was to create the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research as a permanent international scientific organization; the new union had its first constituted meeting at Oxford in England a year later. Further meetings were held in Paris in 1907 and at Mount Wilson in 1910, where the purview of the Union was enlarged to include stellar research, in keeping with Hale&#x27;s emphasis on the Sun as just one among the many other stars. Shortly after the last meeting in Bonn in 1913, World War I broke out, which effectively put an end to the Union&#x27;s activities. Work continued after the 1919 founding of the International Astronomical Union.

During the war, Hale played a key role in founding the National Research Council to support the government in using science for its policy aims, in particular to further its military ends. In 1922, he was appointed at the League of Nations&#x27; Committee on Intellectual Cooperation but had to resign after a few months because of health problems. He was replaced by his colleague Robert Andrew Millikan.

== Personal life ==
Hale suffered from neurological and psychological problems, including insomnia, frequent headaches, and depression. The often-repeated myth of schizophrenia, alleging he claimed to have regular visits from an elf who acted as his advisor, arose from a misunderstanding by one of his biographers. He occasionally took time off to spend a few months at a sanatorium in Maine. These problems forced him to resign as director of Mount Wilson. He died at the Las Encinas Sanitarium in Pasadena in 1938.

<text>The World Zionist Organization (; &quot;HaHistadrut HaTzionit Ha&#x27;Olamit&quot;), or WZO, is a non-governmental organization that promotes Zionism. It was founded as the Zionist Organization (ZO; 1897–1960) at the initiative of Theodor Herzl at the First Zionist Congress, which took place in August 1897 in Basel, Switzerland. The goals of the Zionist movement were set out in the Basel Program.

Operating under the aegis of the WZO are organizations that define themselves as Zionist, such as WIZO, Hadassah, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, Maccabi, the International Sephardic Federation, the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), and more.

The Jewish Agency for Israel is a parallel organisation, with goals, attributes and leadership closely intertwined with those of the Zionist Organization during the years before the establishment of the State of Israel, and to varying degrees after that. Significant changes to the statutes of both organisations occurred in 1952, 1970 and 1979.

==History==

Founded as the Zionist Organization (; &quot;HaHistadrut HaTsionit&quot;), or ZO, in 1897 at the First Zionist Congress, held from August 29 to August 31 in Basel, Switzerland. The ZO&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; was founded in the same year. It changed its name to &quot;World Zionist Organization&quot; in January 1960, when a new constitution was adopted (see full text at External links).

The ZO served as an umbrella organization for the Zionist movement, whose objective was the creation of a Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael – at that time under the Ottoman Empire and following the First World War, the British Mandate of Palestine. When the State of Israel was declared 51 years later on May 14, 1948, many of its new administrative institutions were already in place, having evolved during the regular Zionist Congresses of the previous decades. Some of these institutions remain to this day.

The finances of the WZO were managed by the Jewish Colonial Trust (founded in 1899), and acquisition of land was conducted by the Jewish National Fund (founded in 1901). Keren Hayesod (founded 1920) funded Zionist and Yishuv activities prior to the creation of the state of Israel through enterprises such as the &quot;Palestine Electric Company&quot;, the &quot;Palestine Potash Company&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Palestine Bank&quot;.
Membership in the ZO was open to all Jews, and the right to vote for delegates to the congresses was secured by the purchase of the &quot;Zionist Shekel&quot; i.e. a membership fee or donation named after the ancient Hebrew coin, the shekel. Delegations from all around the world, and from many different political backgrounds and religious traditions, took part in each Congress; delegations/parties were mainly grouped by ideology, rather than by geography.

In 1960 the ZO changed its name to the World Zionist Organization and adopted a new constitution under which individuals are ineligible for membership, which is reserved for organizations.

In 2010, rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv published a letter criticizing the Shas Party for joining the WZO. He wrote that the Party &quot;is turning its back on the basics of Charedi Jewry of the past hundred years. He compared this move to the decision of the Mizrachi movement to join the WZO [over one hundred years ago] which was the deciding factor in their separation from &quot;authentic Torah Judaism.&quot;

In 2009, Natan Sharansky was elected head of the Jewish Agency and Avraham Duvdevani was elected Chairman of the WZO at the 36th Zionist Congress on 15 June 2010.

==World Zionist Congress==
The World Zionist Congress established by Theodor Herzl, is the supreme organ of the World Zionist Organization and its legislative authority. It elects the officers and decides on the policies of the WZO and the Jewish Agency. The first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel, Switzerland in 1897.

==Jerusalem Program==

The platform of the WZO is the Jerusalem Program. The Zionist Council, meeting in Jerusalem in June 2004, adopted this text as the latest version.

&quot;Zionism, the national liberation movement of the Jewish people, brought about the establishment of the State of Israel, and views a Jewish, Zionist, democratic and secure State of Israel to be the expression of the common responsibility of the Jewish people for its continuity and future.

The foundations of Zionism are:

*The unity of the Jewish people, its bond to its historic homeland Eretz Yisrael, and the centrality of the State of Israel and Jerusalem, its capital, in the life of the nation;
*Aliyah to Israel from all countries and the effective integration of all immigrants into Israeli Society.
*Strengthening Israel as a Jewish, Zionist and democratic state and shaping it as an exemplary society with a unique moral and spiritual character, marked by mutual respect for the multi-faceted Jewish people, rooted in the vision of the prophets, striving for peace and contributing to the betterment of the world.
*Ensuring the future and the distinctiveness of the Jewish people by furthering Jewish, Hebrew and Zionist education, fostering spiritual and cultural values and teaching Hebrew as the national language;
*Nurturing mutual Jewish responsibility, defending the rights of Jews as individuals and as a nation, representing the national Zionist interests of the Jewish people, and struggling against all manifestations of anti-Semitism;
*Settling the country as an expression of practical Zionism.&quot;

==Projects and initiatives==

The World Zionist Organization is made up of several departments. The Department of Diaspora Affairs aims to build bridges between Jews everywhere and strengthen Zionist identity among young Jews

The Department of Aliyah Promotion aims to motivate and assist Jews in the process of immigration to Israel, awaken an interest in learning Hebrew and strengthen ties between the Jewish Diaspora and the State of Israel.

The Department of Activities in Israel and Countering Antisemitism seeks to strengthen Jewish Zionist identity among Israelis and combat antisemitism.

The Department of Education works to bolster Jewish-Zionist identity and the connection to the State of Israel and the Diaspora through the Hebrew language and educational content in the formal and informal education systems in Israel and the Diaspora.

* Central Zionist Archives
* Bialik Institute
* Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive

==Herzl Award==
Since 2004, Department for Zionist Activities of the World Zionist Organization bestows the annual Herzl Award for recognition of exceptional volunteer efforts on behalf of Israel and the Zionist cause.

==Controversies==
A document brought before Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court in 2009 showed that private Palestinian land was taken and given to Israeli settlers by the World Zionist Organization. The land in question had been ruled off-limits by Israel. The World Zionist Organization had been acting as an agent of the government in assigning land to Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, to avoid responsibilities under international law, used the World Zionist Organization to settle its citizens in the territory occupied in 1967. The document concerns several homes in the Israeli settlement of Ofra, approximately 15 miles north of Jerusalem in the West Bank. The Israeli Justice Ministry confirmed that the land in question was owned by Palestinians and that the nine houses in question had been ordered demolished. Dror Etkes of Yesh Din said &quot;It&#x27;s an international organization that is, simply put, stealing land.&quot;

In May 2022, activists of the World Zionist Organization disrupted a service of about 150 members of the Women of the Wall at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. A group of 1000 ultra-orthodox girls had been bussed in by the WZO. They attacked the Women of the Wall, taunting, shoving and spitting on them, while some waved WZO flags. The Board of Deputies of British Jews sent an open letter to the WZO demanding an &quot;explanation and calling for urgent remedial action&quot; over the violent harassment.

<text>The Boardwalk Bowl was a postseason college football game held indoors at the former Atlantic City Convention Hall (now Boardwalk Hall) in Atlantic City, New Jersey, from 1961 to 1973.

==History==
From 1961 through 1967, the Boardwalk Bowl featured an annual matchup between Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) and the United States Merchant Marine Academy, and was known as the &quot;Little Army–Navy Game.&quot; Merchant Marine won six of the seven games in the series. The playing surface in these years consisted of natural grass sod that was grown outside and then moved indoors for the game.

In 1968, the Boardwalk Bowl succeeded the Tangerine Bowl as one of the four regional finals in the College Division (which became Division II and Division III in 1973). The other three regionals were the Pecan (later Pioneer), Grantland Rice, and Camellia bowls. During these years, the bowl sought to match the two best non-major teams in a 17-state Eastern Region stretching from New England to Florida. Delaware secured a bid to the game in four consecutive years (1968 through 1971) and won all four games. 

In 1973, under the new Division II playoff system, the Boardwalk Bowl became a national quarterfinal, while the other three quarterfinals were nameless and played at campus sites. The semifinals were the Pioneer and Grantland Rice bowls, and the Camellia was the championship game. Grambling defeated Delaware in the only Boardwalk Bowl played under this format. The game was discontinued after 1973, when the NCAA made all of its quarterfinals unnamed games at campus venues; after 1977 the semifinals likewise were unnamed (though the D-II championship game remained a &quot;bowl&quot; through 1985).

The Boardwalk Bowl, along with the Liberty Bowl (played at Convention Hall in December 1964), showed the feasibility of playing football indoors and led the promoters of football games to look seriously at developing indoor facilities primarily for this purpose.

<doc id="623546" wikidata="Q3599335" url="?curid=623546" title="54-46 That's My Number">
<text>&quot;54-46 (That&#x27;s My Number)&quot; is a song by Fred &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert. Recorded by Toots and the Maytals, the song was originally released on the Beverley&#x27;s label in Jamaica and the Pyramid label in the UK. A follow-up version released a year later, &quot;54-46 Was My Number&quot;, was one of the first reggae songs to receive widespread popularity outside Jamaica, and is seen as being one of the defining songs of the genre. It has been anthologised repeatedly and the titles of several reggae anthologies include &quot;54-46&quot; in their title.

The lyrics describe Toots&#x27; time in prison after being arrested for possession of marijuana. The song features a similar riddim to &quot;Train to Skaville&quot; by Toots and the Maytals&#x27; contemporaries, the Ethiopians.

==In popular culture==

The song appears in the sci-fi film &quot;Repo Men&quot; and in the series &quot;&quot;.

The song is also used as the soundtrack to the opening titles of 2006 Shane Meadows directed movie This is England.

On November 29, 2016, Major Lazer and Bad Royale released &quot;My Number&quot;, a track that samples &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes the song as &quot;a genre-defining classic from legendary ska/reggae group Toots and the Maytals.&quot; This release contains newly recorded vocals from frontman Toots Hibbert specifically designed for Major Lazer, changing the original lyrics to incorporate the group into the song while keeping the original melody.

<text>George Edgar Slusser (July 14, 1939 – November 4, 2014) was an American scholar, professor and writer. Slusser was a well-known science fiction critic. A professor emeritus of comparative literature at University of California, Riverside, he was the first curator of the Eaton collection.

==Background==
Slusser was born in San Francisco in 1939, the son of salesman Raymond Leroy Slusser and Edlo Mildred Raerth. He attended University of California, Berkeley where he studied both philosophy and English. Slusser, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, graduated summa cum laude in 1961 and then attended University of Poitiers, where he earned his diploma in the French language the following year. From 1963 to 1965, Slusser served in Germany assigned to US Army intelligence. In 1965 Slusser married French academic Danièle Chatelain, to whom he would remain married for life. Slusser attended Harvard University, afterward taking a Fulbright Fellowship in Germany as well as serving as a Harvard traveling fellow in France. From 1971 to 1975 he taught English at California State College at San Bernardino as an assistant professor, also working as a freelance author, critic, and translator throughout this period. Although Slusser had been a fan of science fiction as a teen his interest in the genre was reignited in San Bernardino. In 1976 Slusser returned to France as a Fulbright lecturer at University of Paris.

In 1979 Slusser joined University of California, Riverside (UCR) and organized the first annual J. Lloyd Eaton Conference of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, an academic symposium on the genres of science fiction and fantasy literature rather than the more prevalent fan conventions. He commented that the conference&#x27;s ability to attract serious literary critics like Harry Levin spoke to the event&#x27;s gravitas. Slusser helped publish an annual journal, &quot;Bridges to Science Fiction&quot; to publish the outcomes of each conference. With the help of UCR head librarian Eleanor Montague and Cal State San Bernardino librarian Michael Burgess, Slusser became curator of the Eaton collection and Slusser took it upon himself to radically expand the collection&#x27;s holdings. Slusser had pushed for the establishment of both a science fiction studies center and a graduate program for science fiction at the University but the plan died with university chancellor Tomás Rivera.

Slusser continued to teach comparative literature at UCR until his retirement in 2005. A host of science fiction writers and scholars have studied under Slusser, including Howard V. Hendrix, David Leiby, Bradford M. Lyau, and Daryl F. Mallett.

Slusser wrote dozens of books and journal articles. Much of his work was critical analysis of science fiction. He listed Isaac Asimov, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, James Blish, Ray Bradbury, David Brin, Robert Heinlein, Robert Silverberg, and Theodore Sturgeon alongside golden age authors J.-H. Rosny, Olaf Stapledon, Jules Verne, H. G. Wells as the best science fiction writers primarily because of their focus on science in their writings. Slusser praised Bradbury saying &quot;Bradbury just exuded this kind of folksiness that made his works extremely visual... A lot of science fiction writing came out of that Midwestern, iconic American experience that Bradbury defined.&quot; Slusser mentioned that Bradbury&#x27;s technophobia was evident in his works: &quot;to Bradbury, science is the forbidden fruit, destroyer of Eden.&quot; Of Arthur C. Clark, Slusser said that &quot;Clarke, along with Asimov and [Robert A.] Heinlein, is unique in that his human dramas are determined by advances in science and technology... Clarke incarnates the essence of [science fiction], which is to blend two otherwise opposite activities into a single story, that of the advancement of mankind.&quot; Although Slusser considered Robert A. Heinlein the &quot;epitome of science fiction writers&quot; his criticism of the author was far more pointed. Slusser dismissed Heinlein&#x27;s later work as &quot;self-indulgent.&quot; Slusser points out that stories like Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Have Space Suit—Will Travel&quot; draw students because it&#x27;s &quot;like &#x27;Huckleberry Finn&#x27; redone.&quot; In &quot;Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in His Own Land&quot; Slusser condemned the secular sort of Unconditional election philosophy Heinlein propounded in his books: &quot;Heinlein is a writer who represents a certain strain in our culture, a kind of secular Calvinist vision of the world of the elect and the damned.&quot; (Heinlein refuted this interpretation.) Slusser labeled both Heinlein and author Frank Herbert as &quot;potboilers.&quot; Slusser and his wife co-authored a few translations from the original French. In 2012, Slusser and his wife translated the works of J.-H. Rosny into &quot;Three Science Fiction Novellas: From Prehistory to the End of Mankind&quot;.

<doc id="623549" wikidata="Q2120392" url="?curid=623549" title="Sardar Sarovar Dam">
<text>The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a concrete gravity dam built on the Narmada River near the town of Kevadiya, in Narmada District, in the Indian state of Gujarat. The dam was constructed to provide water and electricity to the Indian states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

India&#x27;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation of the project on 5 April 1961. The project took form in 1979 as part of a development scheme funded by the World Bank through their International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to increase irrigation and produce hydroelectricity, using a loan of US$200 million. The construction for dam begun in 1987, but the project was stalled by the Supreme Court of India in 1995 in the backdrop of Narmada Bachao Andolan over concerns of displacement of people. In 2000–01 the project was revived but with a lower height of 111 meters under directions from SC, which was later increased in 2006 to 123 meters and 139 meters in 2017. The Sardar Sarovar Dam is 1210 meters long. The dam was inaugurated in 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The water level in the Sardar Sarovar Dam eventually reached its highest capacity at 138.7 metres on 15 September 2019.

As one of the 25 dams planned on river Narmada, the Sardar Sarovar Dam is the largest structure to be built. It is the second largest concrete dam in the world in terms of the volume of concrete used in its construction, after the Grand Coulee Dam across the Columbia River, US. It is a part of the Narmada Valley Project, a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectricity multi-purpose dams on the Narmada River. After a number of cases before the Supreme Court of India (1999, 2000, 2003), by 2014 the Narmada Control Authority had approved a series of changes in the final height and the associated displacement caused by the increased reservoir, from the original to a final from foundation. The project will irrigate 1.9 million hectare area, most of it in drought prone areas of Kutch and Saurashtra.

The dam&#x27;s main power plant houses six 200 megawatts (MW) Francis pump-turbines to generate electricity and include a pumped-storage capability. Additionally, a power plant on the intake for the main canal contains five 50MW Kaplan turbine-generators. The total installed capacity of the power facilities is 1,450 MW. The tallest statue in the world, the Statue of Unity, faces the dam. This statue has been created as a symbol of tribute to Vallabhbhai Patel.

==Geography==
The dam is located in Gujarat&#x27;s Narmada district and Kevadia village, on the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra. To the west of the dam, is Madhya Pradesh&#x27;s Malwa plateau, where the Narmada river dissects the hills tracts and culminates in the Mathwar hills.

The dam is 1,210 meters long and stands 163 meters tall. The Sardar Sarovar reservoir has a gross capacity of 0.95 million hectares meter and live storage capacity of 0.586 million hectares meter. It occupies an area of 37,000ha with an average length of 214 km and width of 1.7 km. The river catchment area above the dam site is 88,000 square kilometers. It has a spillway discharging capacity of 87,000 cubic meters a second. This dam is one case study to learn about Integrated River Basin Planning, Development and Management.

=== Water management ===
The reservoir operation in the catchment area during the monsoons (from July to October) is well synchronized with the rain forecast. The River Bed Power House (RPBH) is responsible for strategically maximizing the annual allocation of water share. It ensures that minimum water flows downstream, and maximum water is used in the dam overflow period (generally in Monsoons). In non-monsoon months, RPBH takes measures to minimize the conventional and operational losses, avoiding water storage, restricting water intensive perennial crops, adoption of underground pipelines, proper maintenance of canals, related structures and operation of canals on a rotational basis.

== History ==
This project was envisioned by the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of this project in 1961. A thorough survey was carried out by his government to study the usage of the Narmada River which flows through states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to the Arabian Sea.

As the river was shared between the three states (Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh) there were disputes regarding sharing of water and other important resources. As the negotiations were not successful a report was created, and the Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal (NWDT) was established in 1969. In 1979 the NWDT gave its verdict after assessing all the reports.

==Importance in Gujarat==
This dam is called &#x27;the lifeline of Gujarat&#x27;. Seventy five percent of Gujarat&#x27;s command area is considered a drought prone area, this dam will cater for domestic water supply to the regions of Kutch and Saurashatra. In 2021, for the first time Sardar Sarovar Dam provided waters for irrigation in summers.

=== Narmada Canal ===
The dam irrigates of land spread over 12 districts, 62 talukas, and 3,393 villages (75% of which is drought-prone areas) in Gujarat and in the arid areas of Barmer and Jalore districts of Rajasthan. The dam provides drinking water to 9490 villages and 173 urban centers in Gujarat; and 1336 villages and 3 towns in Rajasthan. The dam also provides flood protection to riverine reaches measuring covering 210 villages and Bharuch city and a population of 400,000 in Gujarat. Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation is a major program to help irrigate a lot of regions using the canal&#x27;s water.The length of canal originating from dam is approximately 75,000 km within Gujarat. 

=== Solar power generation ===
In 2011, the government of Gujarat announced plans to generate solar power by placing solar panels over the canal, making it beneficial for the surrounding Villages to get power and also helping to reduce the evaporation of water. The first phase consists of placing panels along a 25 km length of the canal, with a capacity for up to 25 MW of power.

=== Statue of Unity ===
The Government of Gujarat constructed a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as a symbol of tribute. The statue stands in front of the dam and is considered as one of the major tourist attractions in the region.

==Rehabilitation==

=== Resettlement policy and strategy ===
The Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal, setup by Indian government has provided a policy framework under which rehabilitation of affected people has been implemented. The guiding principles of this policy are:

* Improve or at least regain the living standard of the project affected people prior to displacement.
*Should be relocated to villages units or section according to their preference.
*Integration with host community where they have settled.
*Appropriately compensated for adequate social and physical rehabilitation including infrastructure and community services.
*Active participation of affected people in planning of their rehabilitation.
According to a research paper and survey done by Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar and Neeraj Kaushal: &quot;Are Resettled Out sees from the Sardar Sarovar Dam Project Better off Today than their Former - despite implementation glitches, those displaced were far better off than their former forest neighbors in ownership of a range of assets including TVs, cellphones, vehicles, access to schools and hospitals, and agricultural markets. The gap in asset ownership and other outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups was often statistically larger if the heads of the household were illiterate compared to the gap if they were literate. This finding suggests that resettlement helped vulnerable groups more than the less vulnerable and that fears that resettlement will destroy the lives and lifestyles of tribal have been grossly exaggerated.&quot;

== Activism ==

The dam is one of India&#x27;s most controversial, and its environmental impact and net costs and benefits are widely debated. The World Bank was initially funding, but withdrew in 1994 at the request of the Government of India when the state governments were unable to comply with the loan&#x27;s environmental and other requirements. The Narmada Dam has been the center of controversy and protests since the late 1980s.

One such protest takes center stage in the Spanner Films documentary &quot;Drowned Out&quot; (2002), which follows one tribal family who decide to stay at home and drown rather than make way for the Narmada Dam.
An earlier documentary film is called &quot;A Narmada Diary&quot; (1995) by Anand Patwardhan and Simantini Dhuru. The efforts of Narmada Bachao Andolan (&quot;Save Narmada Movement&quot;) to seek &quot;social and environmental justice&quot; for those most directly affected by the Sardar Sarovar Dam construction feature prominently in this film. It received the (Filmfare Award for Best Documentary-1996).

The figurehead for most part of the protest is Medha Patkar, the leader of the NBA. Patkar&#x27;s role is questioned in the protest as she is accused of money laundering. Other notable figures who participated in the protest were Baba Amte, Arundhati Roy and Aamir Khan.

==Height increases==
* In February 1999, the Supreme Court of India gave the go ahead for the dam&#x27;s height to be raised to from the initial .
* In October 2000 again, in a 2-to-1 majority judgment in the Supreme Court, the government was allowed to construct the dam up to .
* In May 2002, the Narmada Control Authority approved increasing the height of the dam to .
* In March 2004, the Authority allowed a height increase to .
* In March 2006, the Narmada Control Authority gave clearance for the height of the dam to be increased from to . This came after 2003 when the Supreme Court of India refused to allow the height of the dam to increase again.
* In August 2013, heavy rains raised the reservoir level to , which forced 7,000 villagers upstream along the Narmada River to relocate.
* In June 2014, Narmada Control Authority gave the final clearance to raise the height from metres to .
* The Narmada Control Authority decided on 17 June 2017 to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam to its fullest height 163-metre by ordering the closure of 30 gates.
* The water level in the Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia in Narmada district reached its highest capacity at 138.7 metres on 15 September 2019.

<text>Ramon Pichot Gironès (; 1871 – 1 March 1925) was a Catalan and Spanish artist. He painted in an impressionist style.

He was a good friend of Pablo Picasso and an early mentor to young Salvador Dalí. Dalí met Pichot in Cadaqués, Spain, when Dalí was only 10 years old. Pichot also made many trips to France, and once in a while, Dalí and his family would go on a trip with Pichot and his family.

He married Germaine Pichot, a well-known artist&#x27;s model, in 1906. Together they had a restaurant near the Bateau Lavoir, called La maison rose. Pichot left Paris after World War I but returned often to buy books, as he had turned into a bibliophile. On such a trip, he suddenly died on 1 March 1925. Picasso was so shaken by this that he included Pichot&#x27;s figure in the painting &quot;Three Dancers&quot;, on which he was working at the time.

In &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, Gertrude Stein describes Pichot as follows:
...Spanish painter Pichot, [...] was rather a wonderful creature, he was long and thin like one of those primitive Christs in Spanish churches and when he did a Spanish dance which he did later at the famous banquet to Rousseau, he was awe-inspiringly religious.

<text>The Townshend Acts () or Townshend Duties were a series of British acts of Parliament passed during 1766 and 1767 introducing a series of taxes and regulations to enable administration of the British colonies in America. They are named after the Chancellor of the Exchequer who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading &quot;Townshend Acts&quot;, but five are often listed:

* [[Townshend Acts|The Revenue Act 1767]] passed on 29 June 1767.
* [[Townshend Acts|The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767]] passed on 29 June 1767.
* [[Townshend Acts|The Indemnity Act 1767]] passed on 2 July 1767.
* [[Townshend Acts|The New York Restraining Act 1767]] passed on 2 July 1767. 
* [[Townshend Acts|The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768]] passed on 8 March 1768.

The purposes of the acts were to
* raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain,
* Create more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations,
* punish the Province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act, and
* establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies.

The Townshend Acts met resistance in the colonies. People debated them in the streets, and in the colonial newspapers. Opponents of the Acts gradually became violent, leading to the Boston Massacre of 1770. The Acts placed an indirect tax on glass, lead, paints, paper, and tea, all of which had to be imported from Britain. This form of revenue generation was Townshend&#x27;s response to the failure of the Stamp Act 1765, which had provided the first form of direct taxation placed upon the colonies. However, the import duties proved to be similarly controversial. Colonial indignation over the acts was expressed in John Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot; and in the Massachusetts Circular Letter. There was widespread protest, and American port cities refused to import British goods, so Parliament began to partially repeal the Townshend duties. In March 1770, most of the taxes from the Townshend Acts were repealed by Parliament under Frederick, Lord North. However, the import duty on tea was retained in order to demonstrate to the colonists that Parliament held the sovereign authority to tax its colonies, in accordance with the Declaratory Act 1766. The British government continued to tax the American colonies without providing representation in Parliament. American resentment, corrupt British officials, and abusive enforcement spurred colonial attacks on British ships, including the burning of the &quot;Gaspee&quot; in 1772. The Townshend Acts&#x27; taxation of imported tea was enforced once again by the Tea Act 1773, and this led to the Boston Tea Party in 1773 in which Bostonians destroyed a large shipment of taxed tea. Parliament responded with severe punishments in the Intolerable Acts 1774. The Thirteen Colonies drilled their militia units, and war finally erupted in Lexington and Concord in April 1775, launching the American Revolution.

==Background==
Following the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the British government was deep in debt. To pay a small fraction of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. But with the Sugar Act 1764, Parliament sought, for the first time, to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists argued that there were constitutional issues involved.

The Americans claimed they were not represented in Parliament, but the British government retorted that they had &quot;virtual representation&quot;, a concept the Americans rejected. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention after Parliament&#x27;s passage of the Stamp Act 1765. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the failure to raise substantial revenue.

Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament&#x27;s authority in the colonies. Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;.

==The Five Townshend Acts==

===The Revenue Act 1767===
This act was the (joint) first act, passed on 29 June 1767, the same day as the Commissioners of Customs Act (see below).

It placed taxes on glass, lead, &quot;painters&#x27; colors&quot; (paint), paper, and tea. It also gave the supreme court of each colony the power to issue &quot;writs of assistance&quot;, general warrants that could be issued to customs officers and used to search private property for smuggled goods.

There was an angry response from colonists, who deemed the taxes a threat to their rights as British subjects. The use of writs of assistance was significantly controversial since the right to be secure in one&#x27;s private property was an established right in Britain.

===The Commissioners of Customs Act 1767===

This act was passed on 29 June 1767. It created a new Customs Board for the North American colonies, to be headquartered in Boston with five customs commissioners. New offices were eventually opened in other ports as well. The board was created to enforce shipping regulations and increase tax revenue. Previously, customs enforcement was handled by the Customs Board back in England. Due to the distance, enforcement was poor, taxes were avoided and smuggling was rampant.

Once the new Customs Board was in operation, enforcement increased, leading to a confrontation with smuggling colonists. Incidents between customs officials, military personnel and colonists broke out across the colonies, eventually leading to the occupation of Boston by British troops. This led to the Boston Massacre.

===The New York Restraining Act 1767===

This was the (joint) third of the five acts, passed on 2 July 1767, the same day as the Indemnity Act.

It forbade the New York Assembly and the governor of New York from passing any new bills until they complied with the Quartering Act 1765. That act required New York to provide housing, food and supplies for the British troops stationed there to defend the colony. New York resisted the Quartering Act saying they were being taxed, yet had no direct representation in Parliament. Furthermore, New York didn&#x27;t think British soldiers were needed any more, since the French and Indian War had come to an end. 

Before the act was implemented, New York reluctantly agreed to provide some of the soldiers&#x27; needs, so it was never applied.

===The Indemnity Act 1767===

This Act was passed together with the New York Restraining Act, on 2 July 1767.

&#x27;Indemnity&#x27; means &#x27;security or protection against a loss or other financial burden&#x27;. The Indemnity Act 1767 reduced taxes on the British East India Company when they imported tea into England. This allowed them to re-export the tea to the colonies more cheaply and resell it to the colonists. Until this time, all items had to be shipped to England first from wherever they were made and then re-exported to their destination, including to the colonies. This followed from the principle of mercantilism in England, which meant the colonies were forced to trade only with England.

The British East India Company was one of England&#x27;s largest companies but was on the verge of collapse due to much cheaper smuggled Dutch tea. Part of the purpose of the entire series of Townshend Acts was to save the company from imploding. Since tea smuggling had become a common and successful practice, Parliament realized how difficult it was to enforce the taxing of tea. The Act stated that no more taxes would be placed on tea, and it made the cost of the East India Company&#x27;s tea less than tea that was smuggled via Holland. It was an incentive for the colonists to purchase the East India Company tea.

===The Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768===

This was the last of the five acts passed. It was not passed until 8 March 1768, the year after the other four. Lord Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after whom the Townshend Acts were named, had died suddenly in September 1767, and so did not introduce this Act.

The Act was passed to aid the prosecution of smugglers. It gave admiralty courts, rather than colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs violations and smuggling. Before the Act, customs violators could be tried in an admiralty court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, if royal prosecutors believed they would not get a favourable outcome using a local judge and jury.

The Vice-Admiralty Court Act added three new admiralty courts in Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston to aid in more effective prosecutions. These courts were run by judges appointed by the Crown and whose salaries were paid, in the first instance, from fines levied. when they found someone guilty. 

The decisions were made solely by the judge, without the option of trial by jury, which was considered to be a fundamental right of British subjects. In addition, the accused person had to travel to the court of jurisdiction at his own expense; if he did not appear, he was automatically considered guilty.


==Townshend&#x27;s program==

===Raising revenue===
The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act 1767 (7 Geo 3 c 46). This act represented the Chatham ministry&#x27;s new approach to generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766. The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or &quot;internal&quot;) tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or &quot;external&quot;) taxes, such as taxes on imports. With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies. These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.

The colonists&#x27; objection to &quot;internal&quot; taxes did not mean that they would accept &quot;external&quot; taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional. &quot;Townshend&#x27;s mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional&quot;, wrote historian John Phillip Reid, &quot;was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.&quot; The Townshend Revenue Act received royal assent on 29 June 1767. There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. &quot;Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage&quot;, wrote historian Peter Thomas.

The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act 1767 (7 Geo 3 c 56), which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea. The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies. The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.

The original stated purpose of the Townshend duties was to raise a revenue to help pay the cost of maintaining an army in North America. Townshend changed the purpose of the tax plan, however, and instead decided to use the revenue to pay the salaries of some colonial governors and judges. Previously, the colonial assemblies had paid these salaries, but Parliament hoped to take the &quot;power of the purse&quot; away from the colonies. According to historian John C. Miller, &quot;Townshend ingeniously sought to take money from Americans by means of parliamentary taxation and to employ it against their liberties by making colonial governors and judges independent of the assemblies.&quot;

Some members of Parliament objected because Townshend&#x27;s plan was expected to generate only £40,000 in yearly revenue, but he explained that once the precedent for taxing the colonists had been firmly established, the program could gradually be expanded until the colonies paid for themselves. According to historian Peter Thomas, Townshend&#x27;s &quot;aims were political rather than financial&quot;.

===American Board of Customs Commissioners===
To better collect the new taxes, the Commissioners of Customs Act 1767 (7 Geo 3 c 41) established the American Board of Customs Commissioners, which was modeled on the British Board of Customs. The board was created because of the difficulties the British Board faced in enforcing trade regulations in the distant colonies. Five commissioners were appointed to the board, which was headquartered in Boston. The American Customs Board would generate considerable hostility in the colonies towards the British government. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, &quot;The actual separation of the continental colonies from the rest of the Empire dates from the creation of this independent administrative board.&quot;

The American Board of Customs Commissioners was notoriously corrupt, according to historians. Political scientist Peter Andreas argues:

Historian Edmund Morgan says:

Historian Doug Krehbiel argues:

Another measure to enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act 1768 (8 Geo 3 c 22). Although often included in discussions of the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the Cabinet when Townshend was not present and was not passed until after his death. Before this act, there was just one vice admiralty court in North America, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have juries, was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.

Townshend also faced the problem of what to do about the New York General Assembly, which had refused to comply with the Quartering Act 1765 because its members saw the act&#x27;s financial provisions as levying an unconstitutional tax. The New York Restraining Act (7 Geo 3 c 59), which according to historian Robert Chaffin was &quot;officially a part of the Townshend Acts&quot;, suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.

==Reaction==

Townshend knew that his program would be controversial in the colonies, but he argued that, &quot;The superiority of the mother country can at no time be better exerted than now.&quot; The Townshend Acts did not create an instant uproar like the Stamp Act had done two years earlier, but before long, opposition to the programme had become widespread. Townshend did not live to see this reaction, having died suddenly on 4 September 1767.
The most influential colonial response to the Townshend Acts was a series of twelve essays by John Dickinson entitled &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot;, which began appearing in December 1767. Eloquently articulating ideas already widely accepted in the colonies, Dickinson argued that there was no difference between &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; taxes, and that any taxes imposed on the colonies by Parliament for the sake of raising a revenue were unconstitutional. Dickinson warned colonists not to concede to the taxes just because the rates were low since this would set a dangerous precedent.

Dickinson sent a copy of his &quot;Letters&quot; to James Otis of Massachusetts, informing Otis that &quot;whenever the Cause of American Freedom is to be vindicated, I look towards the Province of Massachusetts Bay&quot;. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by first sending a petition to King George asking for the repeal of the Revenue Act, and then sending a letter to the other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement. Upon receipt of the Massachusetts Circular Letter, other colonies also sent petitions to the king. Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, but the other colonies did not, believing that it might have been interpreted as an admission of Parliament&#x27;s sovereignty over them. Parliament refused to consider the petitions of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard, instructing him to have the Massachusetts House rescind the Circular Letter. By a vote of 92 to 17, the House refused to comply, and Bernard promptly dissolved the legislature.

When news of the outrage among the colonists finally reached Franklin in London he wrote a number of essays in 1768 calling for &quot;civility and good manners&quot;, even though he did not approve of the measures. In 1770, Franklin continued writing essays against the Townsend Acts and Lord Hillsborough and wrote eleven attacking the Acts that appeared in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, a London daily newspaper. The essays were published between January 8 and February 19, 1770, and can be found in &quot;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin&quot;.

===Boycotts===
Merchants in the colonies, some of them smugglers, organized economic boycotts to put pressure on their British counterparts to work for repeal of the Townshend Acts. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement, which called for merchants to suspend importation of certain British goods effective 1 January 1768. Merchants in other colonial ports, including New York City and Philadelphia, eventually joined the boycott. In Virginia, the non-importation effort was organized by George Washington and George Mason. When the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a resolution stating that Parliament had no right to tax Virginians without their consent, Governor Lord Botetourt dissolved the assembly. The members met at Raleigh Tavern and adopted a boycott agreement known as the &quot;Association&quot;.

The non-importation movement was not as effective as promoters had hoped. British exports to the colonies declined by 38 percent in 1769, but there were many merchants who did not participate in the boycott. The boycott movement began to fail by 1770 and came to an end in 1771.

===Unrest in Boston===
The newly created American Customs Board was seated in Boston, so it was there that the Board concentrated on enforcing the Townshend Acts. The acts were so unpopular in Boston that the Customs Board requested assistance. Commodore Samuel Hood sent the fifty-gun fourth-rate ship HMS &quot;Romney&quot;, which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768.

On 10 June 1768, customs officials seized the &quot;Liberty&quot;, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of the &quot;Romney&quot; had been impressing local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to Castle William for protection. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice-admiralty court, but the charges were eventually dropped.

Given the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed Governor Bernard to try to find evidence of treason in Boston. Parliament had determined that the Treason Act 1543 was still in force, which would allow Bostonians to be transported to England to stand trial for treason. Bernard could find no one who was willing to provide reliable evidence, however, and so there were no treason trials. The possibility that American colonists might be arrested and sent to England for trial produced alarm and outrage in the colonies.

Even before the &quot;Liberty&quot; riot, Hillsborough had decided to send troops to Boston. On 8 June 1768, he instructed General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America, to send &quot;such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston&quot;, although he conceded that this might lead to &quot;consequences not easily foreseen&quot;. Hillsborough suggested that Gage might send one regiment to Boston, but the &quot;Liberty&quot; incident convinced officials that more than one regiment would be needed.

People in Massachusetts learned in September 1768 that troops were on the way. Samuel Adams organized an emergency, extralegal convention of towns and passed resolutions against the imminent occupation of Boston, but on 1 October 1768, the first of four regiments of the British Army began disembarking in Boston, and the Customs Commissioners returned to town. The &quot;Journal of Occurrences&quot;, an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers during the military occupation of Boston, apparently with some exaggeration. Tensions rose after Christopher Seider, a Boston teenager, was killed by a customs employee on 22 February 1770. Although British soldiers were not involved in that incident, resentment against the occupation escalated in the days that followed, resulting in the killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of 5 March 1770. After the incident, the troops were withdrawn to Castle William.

==Partial repeal==
On 5 March 1770—the same day as the Boston Massacre, although news traveled slowly at the time, and neither side of the Atlantic was aware of this coincidence—Lord North, the new Prime Minister, presented a motion in the House of Commons that called for partial repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. Although some in Parliament advocated a complete repeal of the act, North disagreed, arguing that the tea duty should be retained to assert &quot;the right of taxing the Americans&quot;. After debate, the Repeal Act (10 Geo 3 c 17) received royal assent on 12 April 1770.

Historian Robert Chaffin argued that little had actually changed:

The Townshend duty on tea was retained when the 1773 Tea Act was passed, which allowed the East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies. The Boston Tea Party soon followed, which set the stage for the American Revolution.

<text>The Henry Draper Medal is awarded every 4 years by the United States National Academy of Sciences &quot;for investigations in astronomical physics&quot;. Named after Henry Draper, the medal is awarded with a gift of USD $15,000. The medal was established under the Draper Fund by his widow, Anna Draper, in honor of her husband, and was first awarded in 1886 to Samuel Pierpont Langley &quot;for numerous investigations of a high order of merit in solar physics, and especially in the domain of radiant energy&quot;. It has since been awarded 45 times.

The medal has been awarded to multiple individuals in the same year: in 1977 it was awarded to Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson &quot;for their discovery of the cosmic microwave radiation (a remnant of the very early universe), and their leading role in the discovery of interstellar molecules&quot;; in 1989 to Riccardo Giovanelli and Martha P. Haynes &quot;for the first three-dimensional view of some of the remarkable large-scale filamentary structures of our visible universe&quot;; in 1993 to Ralph Asher Alpher and Robert Herman &quot;for their insight and skill in developing a physical model of the evolution of the universe and in predicting the existence of a microwave background radiation years before this radiation was serendipitously discovered&quot; and in 2001 to R. Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy &quot;for their pioneering investigations of planets orbiting other stars via high-precision radial velocities&quot;.

<doc id="623563" wikidata="Q2992747" url="?curid=623563" title="Mon Colle Knights">
<text>Mon Colle Knights, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga series written by Satoru Akahori and Katsumi Hasegawa and illustrated by Hideaki Nishikawa. The original concept was made by Hitoshi Yasuda and Group SNE. The series is based on the Monster Collection trading card game.

An anime television series adaptation animated by Studio Deen aired on TV Tokyo from January to December 2000 and consisted of 51 episodes and one film. The Saban-produced &quot;Mon Colle Knights&quot; aired on Fox Kids in North America from July 2001 to September 2002, consisting of 45 episodes. In 2006, it aired in reruns on Toon Disney&#x27;s Jetix on Sundays, as part of Jetix&#x27;s &quot;Anime Invasion Sundays&quot; block. The manga was published in English in Singapore by Chuang Yi.

On June 9, 2020, the original Japanese version became available on Crunchyroll via Discotek Media. According to Justin Sevakis, the only reason why the anime was only available on Crunchyroll in Japanese is that the masters for the English dub couldn&#x27;t be found. Discotek Media asked fans to help find the masters. They were still searching for it as of September 15, 2020. Discotek Media released the anime sub-only on Blu-ray on April 27, 2021. However, Discotek Media promised that they were still looking for the English dub. Discotek had found the English dub masters and released the English dub on Blu-ray on May 31, 2022.

==Plot==

The series features Mondo Ooya and his classmate/girlfriend Rockna Hiiragi (Rokuna in the Japanese version), whose scientist father Professor Ichiroubei Hiiragi invented a way to travel to Mon World (Roku Mon Sekai: the Six Gate World), where all sorts of magical creatures live. Together, they try to find six monster items which, when combined, could connect the Six Gate World with planet Earth for the better of both worlds. Rokuna and Mondo form the Mon Colle Knights and find out that when chanting a phrase-(&quot;With us, you can do it!&quot;) they can merge into monsters and control them into battle as well as aid with spells. Almost every episode, they battle Professor Hiiragi&#x27;s rival Prince Eccentro (Count Collection in the Japanese version) and his two girl underlings Gluko and Batch (Goruko and Bachi in the Japanese version) who are after the same thing as the Mon Colle Knights, except that they intend to use the items to dominate both worlds.

==Main characters==

===Mon Colle Knights===
: 
:: One of the main protagonists of the series and is an elementary school student at a local public school. Mondo is an adventurous young boy who seeks to gather the Mon items to bring together his world and Mon world for peace and friendship. Even though he has an outgoing and determined nature, Mondo has a little problem: he always flirts with pretty girls (Beginner, Kahimi, and Lailai are the most notable). Note that the first Kanji in Mondo&#x27;s name; &quot;,&quot; is the same that is used in the &quot;Mon Colle Knights&quot; title, . He has devices that he uses for his peace sign attack.

* / Rockna Hiiragi
:: One of the main protagonists of the series. Rokuna is Mondo&#x27;s genius friend and classmate from school, whose intentions match Mondo&#x27;s. She has a special telepathic ability to communicate with monsters. Now her boyfriend Mondo likes drooling over her but she gets jealous if Mondo flirts with other girls causing Rokuna to attack him. The first Kanji in Rockna&#x27;s name; &quot;,&quot; is the same that is used in the Mon Colle Knights title, . She has a baton like devices which she uses for her string or ribbon attack.
: 
:: Rokuna&#x27;s father and a rather eccentric sort of mad scientist. He discovered Mon World and wants the human world to know about it so he can win many awards. His laboratory is right across the street from Mondo and Rokuna&#x27;s school.

* / Lovestar
:: Lovestar is a Zeechi that Rokuna adopted. A pale pink hamster-like monster with a red star marked on its back. In the Japanese version, their &quot;species&quot; is called &quot;Lovestar&quot; because the sounds the creatures make resemble the word &quot;love-love&quot; and the pattern on their backs make a star. Also in the Japanese version, Lovestar is called &quot;Jāne,&quot; because, when Rokuna was trying to say goodbye (&quot;Jā ne&quot;) to it, Lovestar thought she was calling it by name.
: 
:: A tiny monkey monster who punches.

* Cluckputer
:: Professor Hiiragi&#x27;s chicken-based super computer. It usually serves as a computer for Professor Hiiragi and goes off by making chicken noises whenever a monster is nearby.

===Collection team===
* / Prince Ludwig Von Monsterstein Eccentro
:: One of the principal antagonists of the series. Prince Eccentro is a young effeminate aristocrat from Europe who wants to take over Mon World. He was born in 1974 and he was trained by Tanaka when his father wanted him to be a bad guy. He is not very threatening due to his eccentric behavior and hysterical persona at times. However, he is the inventor of the hypnotic Skeitso Beam (whether on his Flying Lion aircraft or Teddyarenaut) which he uses to bend monsters to his will. Because of that, he tends to have his evil moments, though he really isn&#x27;t as evil as he brags himself to be. Everytime Prince Eccentro fails, Tanaka would punish him with back-breaking exercises and/or harsh training that is related to the episode&#x27;s content. His dream is apparently to become a world famous belly dancer.

* Teddyarenaut
:: A bear-like computer created by Eccentro. He serves as the counterpart to the Cluckputer and has a built-in Skeitso Beam. In one episode, he temporarily developed an A.I. because Savant Bear thought he was their king.

* / Batch
:: Eccentro&#x27;s tomboyish lackey, with a brash, spunky, and often sarcastic personality. She tends to be much more committed to evil deeds than the foppish Eccentro or the air-headed Gluko. Batch unfortunately gets punished by Tanaka as well except in two episodes. Batch and Eccentro argue a lot, and sometimes Batch shows amusement at Eccentro&#x27;s mishaps. Ultimately they have a trusting and friendly relationship though, and Batch always follows the Count&#x27;s orders. She is shown to be a fitness enthusiast, as her bedroom is filled with exercise equipment. In the Japanese version, she speaks with a distinct Kansai dialect.

* / Gluko
:: Eccentro&#x27;s big-breasted, yet air-headed and friendly underling. She is always spared by Tanaka when it is time for punishment and has an amount of luck. Goruko never seems to get hurt while the rest of her team and the Mon Colle Knights usually does. An English ongoing joke in the series is that during Eccentro&#x27;s launch sequence in each episode, she asks a very long and logic based question which ends with Eccentro and Batch becoming bored and saying &quot;Never mind, Goruko.&quot; In the Japanese version, Gluko speaks in a very polite and respectful dialect whether she&#x27;s talking to her teammates or her enemies. Goruko also carries around a book detailing about Mon World and his creatures. In a later episode, Gluko ends up adopting a Forest Imp named Impy.

* / Tanaka
:: A midget old man who serves as Eccentro&#x27;s mentor under the orders of Eccentro&#x27;s father. He usually punishes Eccentro for his screw ups (and/or lack of manly attitude) with back-breaking exercises and/or harsh training related to the episode&#x27;s content. Tanaka tends to pop up anywhere.

* / Impy
:: A cheerful young Forest Imp (&quot;Leprechaun&quot; in the Japanese version) who is Goruko&#x27;s pet. Goruko first found him in the forest near where Vipress was imprisoned. Impy doesn&#x27;t talk very much -- he usually only utters short, inquisitive questions (such as &quot;What this?&quot;), or repeats cheerfully what Goruko says. He has psychic powers that allow him to telekinetically move things around, which comes in handy for some of Eccentro&#x27;s schemes. Impy also has a habit of fiddling with buttons on the Flying Lion aircraft and more often than not causing it to explode and send him and his allies blasting off. Despite his apparent carefree and dimwitted personality, Impy does care a lot for Goruko. A running gag sees him using his powers to switch Tanaka and Eccentro around in order for the latter to escape and make his attempt to conquer Mon World for the episode.

===Supporting cast===
* / Naomi Loon
:: Mondo and Rokuna&#x27;s teacher, a rather nice lady who has a short temper and terrible luck with love. Thanks to a malfunctioning Teddyarenaut, there is a monster card featuring her that is in Prince Eccentro&#x27;s possession. She is a skilled fighter as seen in some episodes.
: 
:: A cute but accident-prone girl with a large appetite who is learning to become a summoner. While powerful, her aim is terrible, so she tends to hurt her allies by accident. As a running gag, she has a habit of summoning a giant meteor that always ends destroying something. She is a friend of Mondo and Rokuna. Her grandfather, Expert, runs the summoning school she attends. In the Japanese version, Beginner refers to Mondo and Rokuna collectively as &quot;Roku-Mon-chan,&quot; much to their annoyance.
: 
:: A young girl which the Mon Colle Knights often encounter at random, while she travels the world carrying impossible amounts of little monsters in her coat. She gave Lovestar to Rokuna.

* / Kahimi
::An elf maiden with very long hair, whose beauty incites Rokuna&#x27;s jealousy whenever Mondo compliments Kahimi (though Rokuna holds nothing against Kahimi herself). She becomes a good friend and ally of the Mon Colle Knights, especially with her ability to make plants grow and control over the winds of Mon World.
: 
:: A friend of Beginner&#x27;s who goes to the same summoning school as her. Luke has a poorly-disguised crush on Beginner and seems to like Rokuna. Luke is a summoning prodigy and considers Mondo his biggest rival as a monster summoner and for Beginner&#x27;s heart. Around Beginner, Luke becomes so nervous he can summon only purple sheep, not to be confused with his own sheep friend, Lambda. Beginner, for her part, is oblivious to Luke&#x27;s crush on her. Luke acts rather stingy and aloof towards strangers and he tends to be a bit of a crybaby when things don&#x27;t go his way -- such as when someone, usually Mondo, interacts with Beginner or Lambda -- but he shows himself to quite brave in the face of danger, and his summoning abilities make him handy to have around. Prince Eccentro once lied to Luke telling him that Mondo is not a very good person causing Luke to summon Basilosaurus to attack Mondo with. Luke learned the truth when Prince Eccentro took over Basilosaurus.
:: A purple sheep who is a friend of Luke&#x27;s.

* / Gabriolis
:: A former Light Angel. During a great war between good and evil, he was wounded and left behind by his friend Lark. He felt betrayed and abandoned and embraced the darkness that Redda offered him transforming him into a Dark Angel. He plagued the Mon Colle Knights on different occasions involving attacking Doppelganger and casting a spell on 3 of Mondo&#x27;s cards (consisting of Forester the Forest Giant, Flying Stego, and Scorch the Fire Monster) until Spectra appeared and reversed the spell. When he was weakened by Vipress&#x27;s attack during his fight with Mondo and Water Dragon after Redda took control of the monsters, it was later revealed by Spectra and the Angel of all Oceans that Lark, in fact, took his place in battle and died (in the English dub, he went to divert an approaching enemy flock and wasn&#x27;t seen again) after which Gabriolis realized his error and reverted to good, though maintaining his dark appearance. He also helped Mondo and Rockna defeat Dread Dragon and destroyed Redda in the final episode. Zaha&#x27;s name is derived from Zahariel, which means &quot;Brightness of God&quot;. Zahariel was the angel who would help people resist temptation. This is both ironic and fitting to his character, as he would first failed to resist temptation, then become someone who temps others, then turns into someone who helps others resist temptation, and finally become someone who is able to resist it himself too. The English dubbed name is derived from Gabriel, one of the archangels who typically serves as a messenger to humans from God.

* / Lucca
:: He is a small demonic creature who is Gabriolis&#x27; friend and partner. On one occasion, he had possession of an item that had to be won over in a Mon World Baseball tournament.
: 
:: One of the principal antagonists of the series. Redda is a fallen angel like Gabriolis, who wants to use the six items to summon Oroboros. He is powerful, but not the strongest. Redda would prefer to avoid battle when not having a good advantage. In the dub, he wants to create a world of nothingness. In the original, he wants to create a formless world where all souls are the same and neither good nor evil will exist. Redda was the one who enabled Gabriolis to embrace the darkness after he was seemingly abandoned. In the final battle, he is killed by Gabriolis.

* N-Nouncer
:: A man with a circle that has the letter N on it. He serves as the announcer of any tournaments in Mon World.

* / Spectra the Angel
:: Lark&#x27;s sister and Zaha&#x27;s fiance in the Japanese version (she is Gabriolis&#x27; sister in the English dub) who sports a long gold dress and is always barefoot. Spectra is a Light Angel who comes to Gabriolis in his darkest hour to show him what really happened in the past so he may find redemption. She reappeared when Redda was chasing after her near the Fire Angel&#x27;s castle and was rescued by the Mon Colle Knights.

* Forest Angel / Earth Angel
:: Mon World&#x27;s guardian angel of the Earth Realm who sports five pairs of wings. She first appeared to help the Mon Colle Knights put the Four-Armed Giant back to sleep by summoning the Emerald Dragon. It was the Forest Angel who told the Mon Colle Knights of the Guardian Angels&#x27; roles.

* Flame Angel / Fire Angel
:: The guardian angel of the Fire Realm and the Guardian of the Solar Scepter (one of the Mon items).

* Angel of all Oceans / Water Angel
:: The guardian angel of the Water Realm and Guardian of the Arialla Pearl (one of the Mon items) who sports long purple hair, three wings, wears a strange dress, and is always barefoot. The Angel of all Oceans and Spectra revealed to Gabriolis what really happened the day when he was &quot;abandoned.&quot;

* Cloud Angel
:: Mon World&#x27;s guardian angel of the Wind Realm who sports two pairs of wings.

<doc id="623574" wikidata="Q2989881" url="?curid=623574" title="Marco Polo (Doctor Who)">
<text>Marco Polo is the fourth serial of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast on BBC TV in seven weekly parts from 22 February to 4 April 1964. It was written by John Lucarotti and directed largely by Waris Hussein; John Crockett directed the fourth episode. The story is set in Yuan-era China in the year 1289, where the Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) meet the Italian merchant-explorer Marco Polo (Mark Eden) and Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan (Martin Miller).

Lucarotti—who had previously written works based on Marco Polo&#x27;s adventures—was suggested to producers by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; creator Sydney Newman when the show was early in development. Throughout production, the script was rewritten to make the story more personal to Polo. Barry Newbery, the serial&#x27;s designer, used several historical books for research of the old designs, taking inspiration from 1900 Korean architecture. The serial premiered with nine million viewers, and maintained audience figures throughout its seven-week run. It received generally positive responses from critics and was sold widely overseas, but was erased by the BBC in 1967; the entire serial is missing as a result. The serial received later print adaptations, and soundtrack releases using the surviving audio.

== Plot ==
The TARDIS, badly damaged, lands in the Pamir Mountains of the Himalayas in 1289, and the crew are picked up by Marco Polo&#x27;s (Mark Eden) caravan on its way along the fabled Silk Road to see the Emperor Kublai Khan (Martin Miller). The story concerns the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), and their attempts to thwart the machinations of Tegana (Derren Nesbitt), who attempts to sabotage the caravan along its travels through the Pamir Plateau and across the treacherous Gobi Desert, and ultimately to assassinate Kublai Khan in Peking, at the height of his imperial power. The Doctor and his companions also attempt to regain the TARDIS, which Marco Polo has taken to give to Kublai Khan in effort to regain the Emperor&#x27;s good graces. Susan gets the TARDIS key from Ping-Cho (Zienia Merton) but is captured by Tegana before they can depart. They are finally able to thwart Tegana, who kills himself before he can be executed, restoring the Emperor&#x27;s respect for Marco Polo, and the Emperor allows them to depart.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
Show creator Sydney Newman suggested writer John Lucarotti, an old colleague from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, to the production team during the show&#x27;s early development. Story editor David Whitaker contacted Lucarotti to write for the programme; Lucarotti, who had recently worked on the 18-part radio serial &quot;The Three Journeys of Marco Polo&quot; (1955), was commissioned on 9 July 1963 to write a seven-part serial about Italian merchant and explorer Marco Polo, titled &quot;Dr Who and a Journey to Cathay&quot;. While developing the storyline Lucarotti struggled with the fourth episode, and used anecdotal material from Polo&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, to pad out the plot. The serial was originally placed third in the show&#x27;s running order, to begin broadcast on 18 January 1964, but was pushed back to fourth to accommodate the two-part &quot;filler&quot; serial &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot;. Waris Hussein, who worked on the show&#x27;s first serial, was selected as the director for &quot;Marco Polo&quot;; John Crockett directed the fourth episode in Hussein&#x27;s absence.

Like most serials in the show&#x27;s early history, the costumes for &quot;Marco Polo&quot; were designed by Daphne Dare. The serial&#x27;s designer, Barry Newbery, used Aurel Stein&#x27;s &quot;Ruins of Desert Cathay&quot; (1912) and Nelson Ikon Wu&#x27;s &quot;Chinese and Indian Architecture&quot; (1963) for research of the 13th century designs. Newbery also found that Korean architecture from 1900 was similar to that of the 13th century. The incidental music for the serial was composed by Tristram Cary, who previously worked on &quot;The Daleks&quot;. Cary used conventional instruments for the score, including flute, harp and percussion, and he recorded electronic voices for the second episode&#x27;s sandstorm scenes.

=== Casting and characters ===
Mark Eden was cast as Marco Polo; Hussein had seen Eden in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;A Penny for a Song&quot; in 1962. While the serial&#x27;s narration was originally scripted for the Doctor, Ian and Barbara, Hussein decided to make the story more personal to Polo, and the narration was rewritten for Eden. Derren Nesbitt, who had appeared in several historical film series in the 1950s, was cast as Tegana. For the role of Ping-Cho, Hussein wanted an &quot;oriental&quot; actress who had not appeared in the West End production of &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; or the film &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963), due to the prominence of those productions. Actress Zienia Merton auditioned at Hussein&#x27;s home, and was offered the role. William Russell was unhappy with sudden rewrites minimising the role of his character, Ian Chesterton, in the serial, and his agent wrote to BBC&#x27;s head of serials Donald Wilson; Wilson replied to Russell&#x27;s agent, assuring that he would &quot;be watching very carefully&quot; to ensure the scripts &quot;use [Russell&#x27;s] talents to the maximum&quot;. The fifth episode featured an untrained spider monkey, which the cast found difficult to work with; Carole Ann Ford recalled that &quot;it was a nasty little thing peeing all over the place and biting anyone who came near it&quot;.

=== Filming ===
A week of shooting took place at Ealing Studios from 13 to 17 January 1964, consisting mostly of inserts of locations and props for the montage sequences. Rehearsals for the first episode ran from 27 to 30 January, and the episodes were recorded weekly at Lime Grove Studio D from 31 January to 13 March. When William Hartnell became ill in the first week of February, quick rewrites were performed on the second episode to eliminate the Doctor from most scenes; Hartnell only had one line of dialogue in the episode. For the sandstorm in the second episode, a wind machine was used, with other footage superimposed on top; Hussein was unhappy with the effectiveness of the effect, later stating that &quot;it looked like everyone&#x27;s aerials had blown over&quot;. Merton recalled the wind machine blowing sawdust into her eyes, rendering her unable to see for the rest of the scene. During camera rehearsals for the sixth episode, Eden&#x27;s right hand was accidentally lacerated by a dagger used by Nesbitt.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===

The first episode was broadcast on BBC TV on 22 February 1964, and was watched by 9.4 million viewers. The following two episodes maintained the same viewing figures, rising to 9.9 million for the fourth episode, before dropping to 9.4 million for the fifth and 8.4 million for the sixth; from the sixth episode, the show&#x27;s broadcast time was pushed a further fifteen minutes, from 5:15pm to 5:30pm, overlapping with competitor programme &quot;ITN News&quot;. The final episode was watched by 10.4 million viewers. The Appreciation Index dropped slightly across the seven episodes, from 63 to 59. The serial was sold widely overseas, but was erased by the BBC on 17 August 1967; the entire serial is missing as a result. It is one of three stories of which no footage whatsoever is known to have survived, though tele-snaps (images of the show during transmission, photographed from a television) of episodes 1–3 and 5–7 exist, and were subsequently released with the original audio soundtrack, which was recorded &quot;off air&quot; during the original transmission. The serial gained the attention of two sources for further development: in June 1964, Young World Publications showed interest in adapting the serial for the &quot;Super Mag&quot; comic series, but were turned down as the comic rights had been sold to &quot;TV Comic&quot;; and in July 1964, The Walt Disney Company approached the BBC for the film rights to &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, though no developments were made.

=== Critical response ===
The serial received positive reviews from television critics and viewers. Following the broadcast of the first episode, the BBC Programme Review Board noted that there were &quot;several appreciative notes&quot; on the show. Philip Purser of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; noted that Eden impersonated Marco Polo &quot;with sartorial dash&quot;, but felt that the main characters were poorly written, describing Barbara as &quot;a persistent drip&quot;. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the story was &quot;wonderful, but a little too loose and unstructured to be the all conquering classic of repute&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the serial as &quot;an amazing tour de force&quot;, praising Lucarotti&#x27;s scripts, dialogue, and characters, Hussein&#x27;s direction, Newbery&#x27;s sets, Dare&#x27;s costumes, Cary&#x27;s score, and the cast performances. In a 2008 review, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the serial, stating that &quot;the historical landscape was rarely mapped with such poetry and elegance&quot;, though he noted inconsistencies in the foreign characters&#x27; accents. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete History&quot; (2016), editor John Ainsworth described the serial as &quot;exotic and arresting&quot;, praising the simplicity of the narrative and the exploration of the characters.

== Commercial releases ==

A novelisation of this serial, written by Lucarotti based on his original scripts, was published in hardback by W. H. Allen &amp; Co. in December 1984, with a cover painting by David McAllister; the paperback was published by Target Books in April 1985. A three-CD set of the audio soundtrack was released in November 2003, as part of the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, with linking narration by William Russell and a fold-out map of Polo&#x27;s journey. This was later re-released as part of &quot;Doctor Who: The Lost TV Episodes: Collection One&quot; in August 2010 by AudioGO, along with the original camera scripts of the episodes, and released as a vinyl record by Demon Records in September 2020. An audiobook of Lucarotti&#x27;s novel was released in December 2018, narrated by Zienia Merton in her final professional engagement before her death.

A condensed 30-minute reconstruction of the serial, compiled by Derek Handley using telesnaps, photographs and the off-air soundtrack recording, was released as a special feature on the DVD release of &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot;, as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Beginning&quot; box set, on 30 January 2006. The telesnaps were also published in a &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; special edition, &quot;The Missing Episodes – The First Doctor&quot;, in March 2013. Charles Norton, director of several animated reconstructions, noted in 2019 that an animated version of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; was unlikely in the near future due to the significant resources required, such as costumes and characters.

<doc id="623575" wikidata="Q129135" url="?curid=623575" title="Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)">
<text>Mother Earth is the second studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation. Originally released on 24 December 2000 in the Netherlands, and 21 August 2001 in other parts of Europe. The album was licensed to be released in Germany and neighboring countries through GUN Records in January 2003 as a special extended edition with four bonus tracks. The same edition reached the United Kingdom through Sanctuary Records with a release in September 2004. The album was re-released by Roadrunner Records on 28 September 2007, with bonus live tracks. On 5 August 2008, &quot;Mother Earth&quot; along with &quot;The Silent Force&quot; was released in the United States on Roadrunner Records. On 17 December 2018, it was announced that the album would be rereleased on vinyl in January 2019.

The album features mainly fantasy and nature themes and was a sleeper hit in the band&#x27;s heartland, entering the Dutch charts at number eighty-two, by the end of 2000, and only managing to reach its peak third position two years later with the second release of the single Ice Queen. The album later reached double platinum status in the Netherlands, platinum in Germany, and gold in Belgium. As of 2011, the album had reportedly sold 800,000 copies.

==Recording==
By 1999 the band had built their own studio and had begun recording demos for the &quot;Mother Earth&quot; album there. The album itself was recorded in Studio RS29 in Waalwijk, the Netherlands. Oscar Holleman, who had produced and engineered &quot;The Dance&quot;, was again producer and one of the sound engineers was Stephen van Haestregt, future drummer for the band. Sharon recalls that &quot;I had a day for each song, which is still not very much, but you can try out things. We also did some demos before the recordings, so there you can check if you like or dislike parts of a song, and so you have more time when it comes to recording&quot;. Ayreon&#x27;s Arjen Lucassen provided the guitar solo for the track &quot;Dark Wings&quot;.

==Music style==

The sound of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; was a departure for the band. According to Robert Westerholt, the album was a natural progression of their first album &quot;Enter&quot;, as the band didn&#x27;t want to release the same kind of music twice. As a result, they opted to make the songs on a faster tempo and change the tone of the lyrics. In a 2008 interview with Faceculture, den Adel states that &quot;Mother Earth&quot; was &quot;a little bit older, a little bit more knowledgeable about how we wanted to sound, even then, of course you grow, so we had a better picture of how we wanted to sound. We didn&#x27;t want to have the grunt vocals anymore. We felt like everyone was using that as a gimmick, and we didn&#x27;t want to have it in our music anymore because of that...and also we were very much enthralled by a movie at that time, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, which was very Celtic, and that&#x27;s how our album became very Celtic because we were so in love with the soundtrack of the Braveheart movie. So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way. The songs were sometimes written in a day, it did take time to work it out more, the way it sounded in the end, but it was like the ideas and the whole concepts of certain songs were written mostly in one day, the chorus and the verses.&quot;

According to Metal Injection, the album critical and commercial success can be attributed to the combination of its musical ambiance and the imagery the band presented at that time, citing the landscapes from the Mother Earth music video as an example of the great blend between their musical style and visual presentation. Louder Sound also pointed the bombastic and cinematic characteristics present on the album, highlighting the use of synthesizers and strings. Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad pointed the visual aspect of the concerts at that time as another contributing factor to the growing popularity of the band, as the stage decoration, the band members outfits and the use of pyrotechnics suited well the epic aspect of their sound and lyrics.

==Reception==
The album, which was considered the band&#x27;s breakthrough, received positive reviews particularly around Europe. AllMusic rated the album stars, the reviewer calling it &quot;easily one of the best releases of 2001&quot;, and praising it for its &quot;mature and confident sound&quot; and Sharon den Adel&#x27;s &quot;elusive and intangible presence&quot;, adding &quot;The rise of goth/prog metal seemed to reach a peak at the turn of the century, with an endless supply of bands offering their own spin on the subgenre. Only a handful of these bands seem to have anything interesting or unique to offer... With the release of &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, there was little doubt that the cream of the crop had indeed risen to the top... A landmark release that set new standards for creativity, musicianship, and taste – not just for goth/prog metal, but for any style of music.&quot; German magazine Rock Hard awarded the album a score of 7.5 out of 10 and considered it an improvement over their debut album, Enter, praising den Adel&#x27;s vocals and the catchiness of the songs, locating the album between pop music and gothic metal. Chris Flaaten, from heavy metal webzine Chronicles of Chaos, also pointed the renewal the band showed in the album in comparison to their debut, and gave the album a positive score of 7 out of 10. The reviewer praised the instrumentals and how it was managed well in what refers to establishing the fantasy-like setting the album presents. However, he considered that while the band had gotten &quot;more epic&quot;, they also got &quot;more mellow&quot;, citing the &quot;easy listening&quot; aspect as a weakness for those who seek intensity on the metal genre.

=== Accolades ===
==Commercial performance==
When first released, by the end of the year 2000, the album entered the charts only in the band&#x27;s home country at position eighty-two, peaking at position sixty-seven at the beginning of 2001 before falling off the charts. Two singles were released that year, the first for the track &quot;Our Farewell&quot;, which failed to enter any charts, and the second for the track &quot;Ice Queen&quot;, which debuted at position seventy-three in June 2001 and disappeared from the Dutch charts right after. With the release of a second version of the single due to a better elaborated music video, the song started climbing the Dutch and Belgian charts, resulting on a new sales boost for the album, which quickly re-entered the charts and ended up peaking at the third position on both countries in 2002. As a result, from the intense airplay of the music video on Dutch music TV channel The Box, mainstream radio stations opted for also playing the song despite it being too heavy for their audiences. Over the course of that year, the album reached platinum status in the Netherlands, with sales in excess of 80,000 copies, and gold status in Belgium, with sales in excess of 25,000 copies. With the album receiving distribution in new European countries by the beginning of 2003, it also managed to enter the German, Swiss and Austrian charts. In Germany, the album peaked at number 7 and was later certified platinum on the country, with sales in excess of 200,000 copies. By the beginning of 2004, the album also entered the Norwegian charts at number seventeen, peaking at number eleven three weeks later. In 2021, two decades after its release, the album reached a second platinum status in the Netherlands, totaling 160,000 copies sold in the band&#x27;s home country.

<text>The Paraná River ( ; ; ) is a river in south-central South America, running through Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina for some . Among South American rivers, it is second in length only to the Amazon River. It merges with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

The first European to go up the Paraná River was the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot, in 1526, while working for Spain.

A drought hit the river in 2021, causing a 77-year low.

== Etymology ==
In eastern South America there is &quot;an immense number of river names containing the element &quot;para-&quot; or &quot;parana-&quot;&quot;, from Guarani language words meaning &quot;river&quot; or &quot;sea&quot;; attempts to derive a more precise meaning for the name of this, the largest of them, e.g. &quot;kin of the sea&quot;, have been discounted.

== Course ==

The course is formed at the confluence of the Paranaiba and Rio Grande rivers in southern Brazil. From the confluence the river flows in a generally southwestern direction for about before encountering the city of Saltos del Guaira, Paraguay. This was once the location of the Guaíra Falls (Sete Quedas waterfalls, where the Paraná fell over a series of seven cascades. This natural feature was said to rival the world-famous Iguazu Falls to the south. The falls were flooded, however, by the construction of the Itaipu Dam, which began operating in 1984.
For approximately the next , the Paraná flows southward and forms a natural boundary between Paraguay and Brazil until the confluence with the Iguazu River. Further upstream from this confluence, however, the river is dammed by the Itaipu Dam, the third largest hydroelectric power plant in the world (following the Three Gorges Dam and the Baihetan Dam, both in the People&#x27;s Republic of China), creating a massive, shallow reservoir behind it.

After merging with the Iguazu, the Paraná becomes the natural border between Paraguay and Argentina. Overlooking the Paraná River from Encarnación, Paraguay, across the river, is downtown Posadas, Argentina. The river continues its general southward course for about before making a gradual turn to the west for another , and then encounters the Paraguay River, the largest tributary along the course of the river. Before this confluence, the river passes through a second major hydroelectric project, the Yacyretá Dam, a joint project between Paraguay and Argentina. The massive reservoir formed by the project has been the source of a number of problems for people living along the river, most notably the poorer merchants and residents in the low-lying areas of Encarnación, a major city on the southern border of Paraguay. River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city&#x27;s lower areas.

From the confluence with the Paraguay River, the Paraná again turns to the south for another approximately through Argentina, making a slow turn back to the east near the city of Rosario for the final stretch of less than before merging with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata. This flows into the Atlantic Ocean. During the part of its course downstream from the city of Diamante, Entre Ríos, it splits into several arms and it forms the Paraná Delta.
==Tributaries==
The main tributaries from the mouth:

*Period: 1971–2000

==Uses==
Together with its tributaries, the Rio Paraná forms a massive drainage basin that encompasses much of the southcentral part of South America, essentially including all of Paraguay, much of southern Brazil, northern Argentina, and the southeastern part of Bolivia. If the Uruguay River is counted as a tributary to the Paraná, this watershed extends to cover most of Uruguay as well. The volume of water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean through the Río de la Plata roughly equals the volume at the Mississippi River delta. This watershed contains a number of large cities, including São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Rosario, Asunción, Brasília, and La Plata.

The Paraná and its tributaries provide a source of income and of daily sustenance for fishermen who live along its banks. Some of the species of fish (such as the surubí and the sábalo) are commercially important, and they are exploited for heavy internal consumption or for export. The Parana River delta ranks as one of the world&#x27;s greatest bird-watching destinations.

Much of the length of the Paraná is navigable, as part of the and the . The river serves as an important waterway linking inland cities in Argentina and Paraguay with the ocean, providing deepwater ports in some of these cities. The construction of enormous hydroelectric dams along the river&#x27;s length has blocked its use as a shipping corridor to cities further upstream, but the economic impact of those dams offsets this. The Yacyretá Dam and the Itaipu Dam on the Paraguay border have made the small, largely undeveloped nation of Paraguay the world&#x27;s largest exporter of hydroelectric power.

Due to its use for oceangoing ships, measurements of the water tables extend back to 1904. The data correlates with the Sun&#x27;s solar cycle.

<text>Alicia Roanne Witt (born August 21, 1975) is an American actress and musician. She first came to fame as a child actress after being discovered by David Lynch, who cast her in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990). Witt was a regular on Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot; (1995–1998) for four seasons, playing the title character&#x27;s daughter, Zoe Woodbine. She had a critically acclaimed role as a disturbed teenager in &quot;Fun&quot; (1994), appeared as a music student in &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; (1995) and as a terrorized college student in the horror film &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998). She appeared in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;Last Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;88 Minutes&quot; (2007), &quot;I Care A Lot&quot; (2020) and &quot;Longlegs&quot; (2024). Witt has made television appearances in shows such as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Justified&quot; and &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;.

In addition to her acting, Witt is an accomplished pianist, singer, and songwriter. She has starred in nine annual Hallmark Christmas films, the first broadcast in 2013. In her most recent Hallmark film, &quot;Christmas Tree Lane&quot; (2020), she was also executive producer and storywriter, and contributed two original songs which her character sings.

== Early life and education ==
Witt was born on August 21, 1975 in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Diane (née Pietro), a junior high school reading teacher, and Robert Witt, a science teacher and photographer. Her mother was an American and &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; holder for the longest hair from 1989 to 1996. Witt has a brother, Ian. Talking by age two and reading by the age of four, she has been described as a child prodigy. Her acting talent was recognized by director David Lynch in 1980, when he heard her recite Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on the television show &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; at age five. Lynch began working with her in film and television before Witt earned her high-school equivalency credential at age 14. From the ages of 10 to 14, she took four piano lessons a week, including from a Boston University professor, and competed nationally.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
Witt&#x27;s discovery by Lynch led to her casting as the &quot;flame-haired&quot; child in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), as Paul Atreides&#x27;s sister Alia; she turned eight during filming. She worked with Lynch again when she appeared in an episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, playing the younger sister of Lara Flynn Boyle&#x27;s character Donna.

Her acting background led to small parts in Mike Figgis&#x27; &quot;Liebestraum&quot; in 1991 (her brother Ian also appears), the Gen-X drama &quot;Bodies, Rest &amp; Motion&quot; (1993), and the television film &quot;The Disappearance of Vonnie&quot; (1994). In 1994, Witt landed her first lead role in a film, playing a disturbed, murderous teenager in &quot;Fun&quot; and receiving the Special Jury Recognition Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Witt was then cast in &quot;Four Rooms&quot; as Madonna&#x27;s lover in the episode &quot;The Missing Ingredient&quot;.

Witt was introduced to a larger audience in the role of Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s daughter, Zoey Woodbine, in the sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot;. While playing that part from 1995 to 1998, she also had film roles in Stephen Herek&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;, Alexander Payne&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot;, Robert Allan Ackerman&#x27;s &quot;Passion&#x27;s Way&quot; (based on the Edith Wharton novel, &quot;The Reef&quot;) and Richard Sears&#x27; comedy &quot;Bongwater&quot;. After &quot;Cybill&quot; was cancelled, Witt went on to leading roles in Jamie Blanks&#x27; horror film &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), and in Kevin Altieri/Touchstone Pictures&#x27; limited-release animated feature &quot;Gen13&quot;.

In 2000, Witt had starring roles on episodes of the television shows &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the lead role in the Matthew Huffman comedy &quot;Playing Mona Lisa&quot; and a part in John Waters&#x27; &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot;.

Next, she acted in a small part in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001). Witt played &quot;Two&quot;, the college graduate discussing loss of her virginity, in Rodrigo García&#x27;s &quot;Ten Tiny Love Stories&quot; and played the role of promiscuous Barbie, half-sister of the title character, in &quot;American Girl&quot;. Witt also appeared in Marc Lawrence&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002).

In 2003–04, she lived in the United Kingdom (during this time she portrayed Joan Allen&#x27;s daughter in the U.S.-based comic drama &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;). Between the two projects, Witt went to South Africa to shoot a film interpretation of the epic poem &quot;Das Nibelungenlied&quot;, played one of the central characters, Kriemhild, in the German television film &quot;Kingdom in Twilight&quot;. &quot;Kingdom in Twilight&quot; has the title &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;The Ring of the Nibelungs&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Xanten&quot; elsewhere.

Witt filmed the &quot;Last Holiday&quot; (2006) and the thriller &quot;88 Minutes&quot; (2007) and joined the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; for the 2007–2008 season. In the latter she played Detective Nola Falacci, a character temporarily replacing Megan Wheeler as Detective Mike Logan&#x27;s partner (who was away on maternity leave) and was a recurring character in the 2007–2008 season. Witt appeared in the role of Amy in the film &quot;Peep World&quot; (2010).

Witt appeared as the character Elaine Clayton in &quot;Cowgirls &#x27;n Angels&quot; (2012), and in 2013, co-starred in the independent film &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines); therein, she additionally performed an original musical piece over the end credits. Her dramatic performance in this film was critically acclaimed, with &quot;New York Magazine&quot;″s David Edelstein proclaiming her turn one of the top performances of 2013. She appeared in four Christmas films in 2013: the feature film &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s A Madea Christmas&quot;, &quot;A Snow Globe Christmas&quot; for the Lifetime Channel and &quot;A Very Merry Mix-Up&quot; for the Hallmark Channel and in 2014, the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Christmas at Cartwright&#x27;s&quot;. Also in 2014, Witt appeared in a guest-starring role on the DirecTV series, &quot;Kingdom&quot;, which aired that October.

In 2014, in the fifth season of the FX series &quot;Justified&quot; she played Wendy Crowe, the brightest member of a Floridian crime family that gets entangled in the show&#x27;s events in Kentucky. In April 2016, Witt appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;; the same month, it was announced that she would also be reprising her role as Gersten Hayward in the 2017 &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; series. Witt filmed a guest-starring role on season 12 of &quot;Supernatural&quot; as Lily Sunder, a former enemy of Castiel&#x27;s.

=== Theater ===
Witt made her stage debut in 2001, at Los Angeles&#x27; historic Tiffany Theater, in Robbie Fox&#x27;s musical &quot;The Gift&quot;, in which she played a high-priced, albeit disease-carrying, stripper.

While in residence in the UK in 2004, she starred as Evelyn in a stage production of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; at the New Ambassadors Theatre. In September 2006, Witt returned to the London stage at the Royal Court Theatre, in the critically well-received &quot;Piano/Forte&quot;, wherein she was &quot;well-cast&quot; in portraying the stammering, emotionally damaged pianist Abigail, sister to &quot;unloved attention-seeker&quot; Louise (Kelly Reilly).

Witt performed alongside Amber Tamblyn in Neil LaBute&#x27;s play, &quot;Reasons to Be Pretty&quot;, at the Geffen Playhouse, which ran until August 31, 2014.

=== Music ===

In addition to acting, Witt is a professional singer-songwriter and pianist, and is reported to have been a musical prodigy. She played piano at the restaurant at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in the early/mid 1990s.

Responses to her 2006 stage portrayal of Abigail in &quot;Piano/Forte&quot;, which included scenes of piano-playing, noted her skill as an &quot;outstanding pianist&quot;.

In 2009, Witt released her self-titled extended play album, followed by &quot;Live at Rockwood&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Revisionary History&quot; in 2015; the latter was produced by Ben Folds. In 2013, Witt and Folds performed a song they had co-written on the soundtrack for the independent film &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;. &quot;The Nashville Scene&quot; said of &quot;Revisionary History&quot;: &quot;Witt&#x27;s new album &quot;Revisionary History&quot; is a piano-pop gem that sounds by turns like &#x27;Grey Seal&#x27;–era Elton John, an alt-universe Fiona Apple and a film-noir chanteuse notching her nights in cigarette burns on the fallboard.&quot;

In 2016, Witt joined the cast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot; in a recurring capacity playing established country singer Autumn Chase. Witt performed several songs throughout season four.

In August 2018, Witt released a five-song EP album titled &quot;15,000 Days&quot; (a reference to the length of time she had been alive when she recorded the album) working with producer Jacquire King. She is currently finishing recording her new album, which she co-produced with Jordan Lehning and Bill Reynolds. Titled &quot;The Conduit&quot;, it was scheduled to be released in September (24th, most regions) of 2021.

In 2020, Witt released two new Christmas songs, as heard in her Hallmark Christmas film, &quot;Christmas Tree Lane&quot;. &quot;Why Christmas&quot; and &quot;Christmas Will Never End&quot; are performed on-screen by her character, music-store owner and songwriter Meg.

In August 2023, Witt released the six-song EP, &quot;Witness&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
In September 1990, Witt competed on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

Witt was ranked No. 72 and No. 64 on the &quot;Maxim Hot 100 Women&quot; (2000 and 2001, respectively).

On June 14, 2004, Witt modeled what is believed to be the most expensive hat ever made, for Christie&#x27;s auction house in London. The &quot;Chapeau d&#x27;Amour&quot;, designed by Louis Mariette, is valued at US$2.7 million and is encrusted in diamonds.

On October 5, 2021, Witt released a book called &quot;Small Changes: A Rules-Free Guide to Add More Plant-Based Foods, Peace &amp; Power to Your Life&quot;.

In 2023, Witt competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Dandelion&quot;. While having bested Dee Snider as &quot;Doll&quot; and Lou Diamond Phillips as &quot;Mantis&quot; (who was spared by Robin Thicke ringing the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell) on &quot;WB Movie Night&quot;, she was eliminated in &quot;Masked Singer in Space&quot; alongside Melissa Joan Hart as &quot;Lamp&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On December 20, 2021, Witt&#x27;s parents were found dead in their Worcester, Massachusetts, home. The cause was revealed on February 24, 2022, as &quot;probable cardiac dysrhythmia&quot; due to the cold of their neglected and improperly heated home. In a Facebook post, Witt revealed that her parents were fiercely independent and refused help with home repairs.

Witt battled breast cancer in 2021, and has been cancer-free since 2022 after undergoing chemotherapy and a mastectomy. In light of her cancer diagnosis and treatment, Witt has quit drinking alcohol.

<text>The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot; subtitled An Analysis of The Keynesian Fallacies, (1959) is a book by Henry Hazlitt offering a detailed critique of John Maynard Keynes&#x27; work &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; (1936).

==Overview==

In his critical analysis of &quot;The General Theory&quot; Hazlitt embarked on this project because, in his view, although general critiques of Keynes and &quot;The General Theory&quot; had been made, no critic had completed a detailed analysis of the work. 

==Reception==

&quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; sold well but did not have a large impact on the general public or academia. Economic professor Louis Hacker, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Hazlitt&#x27;s efforts to debunk Keynes a &quot;heroic and perhaps even a Sisyphean task...Mr. Hazlitt, for his part, has written a technical book which is not obscure—although it is difficult reading&quot; and predicted that Hazlitt will be attacked for his book. In 1959, the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; included &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; in its list of &quot;250 Outstanding Books Published in the Past Year.&quot;

Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises called it &quot;a devastating criticism of the Keynesian doctrines.&quot; Gene Epstein referred to it as a &quot;fantastic read, a lucid, lively, obsessive dissection of the most influential and most overrated economics book of this century: The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money...A must-read for economists and laymen alike.&quot; A review in the &quot;New York University Law Review&quot; stated: &quot;Henry Hazlitt has shown the work of John Maynard Keynes to be irresponsible, obscurantist, and often simply silly...No one who reads &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; can henceforward take seriously the doctrines associated with the name of Keynes.&quot;

A review in the &quot;Labor Law Journal&quot; noted that &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; &quot;subjects Keynes&#x27;s celebrated work to a penetrating critical analysis, chapter by-chapter and theorem-by-theorem.&quot; A review in &quot;Challenge&quot; stated: &quot;It is, of course, true that Keynes&#x27; ideas have been accepted too uncritically by many economists, and Hazlitt&#x27;s well-written book should go far toward dispelling such unquestioning acceptance&quot; but that Hazlitt failed to recognize that allowing depressions to &quot;&#x27;grind themselves out&#x27; in the &#x27;long run&#x27; will no longer be tolerated.&quot; A review in the Italian journal &quot;Giornale degli Economisti e Annali di Economia&quot; hoped new opinions like the ones expressed in &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; will help change traditional economic theories promulgated by universities. The &quot;Journal of Demographic Economics&quot; (originally named the &quot;Louvain Economic Review&quot; in English) called &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; an &quot;important work...The author analyzes in detail different chapters of the &quot;General Theory&quot; and highlights the major weaknesses of the ideas that are developed there. This study leads...to a condemnation of Keynesian principles of economic policy.&quot;

Keynesian economist Kenneth K. Kurihara wrote that &quot;The Failure of the &quot;New Economics&quot;&quot; &quot;reflected the critical and hostile attitude of American business circles toward Keynesian analysis and policy.&quot;

A review in the &quot;Economic Record&quot; was critical of Hazlitt&#x27;s comprehension of demand curves, elasticities, and multipliers and wrote: &quot;[Hazlitt] flattered himself that he could turn mathematical purblindness into a virtue...It is a pity, because the author certainly writes in a vigorous, somewhat sardonic, style of his own...the author is apt to light his rockets at the wrong end. Thus the audience, instead of being treated to some really illuminating fireworks, is merely smothered by stifling clouds of acrid dust.&quot;

Reviewer Joseph McKenna, writing in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, commented that while the &quot;General Theory&quot; is &quot;far from perfect&quot; Hazlitt &quot;does little to improve matters.&quot; McKenna stated that Hazlitt failed to clear up the ambiguities in definitions from the &quot;General Theory&quot; and ignores the fact that the &quot;General Theory&quot; applies only in conditions of unemployment. Furthermore, McKenna criticizes Hazlitt&#x27;s positions on mathematical formulas, aggregation, and depressions and writes: &quot;Although Hazlitt clears up many minor points in the General Theory, his analysis of the major ones is completely unsatisfactory.&quot;

Post-Keynesian economist Abba P. Lerner criticized Hazlitt for his assumption of a world with full employment where wages rates are permitted to fall during a depression. Lerner also criticized Hazlitt for &quot;missing some of the basic elements of the Keynesian analysis&quot; such as failing to distinguish between thrift and savings and his interpretation of Say&#x27;s law.

<doc id="623587" wikidata="Q129108" url="?curid=623587" title="Enter (Within Temptation album)">
<text>Enter is the debut studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation, released by DSFA Records in 1997. After the band became more widely known in foreign markets, it was re-released by the independent label Season of Mist in North America in 2007, and by Nuclear Blast in 2014. It was produced by Lex Vogelaar, founder of the Dutch death metal band Orphanage, and had to recorded, completed and mixed within three weeks.

The album prominently features lead singer Sharon den Adel&#x27;s vocals as well as guitarist Robert Westerholt&#x27;s gruff death metal growls. It is considered a gothic metal release with elements from doom metal, and the lyrics focus mostly on dark and supernatural themes. The track &quot;Restless&quot; was released as the first and only single. Although the album failed to achieve commercial success at the time of its release, it entered the Dutch Charts in 2002 after the commercial success of the band&#x27;s following album.

==Recording==
One week after they signed with DSFA Records, Within Temptation started recording &quot;Enter&quot;. The tracks on the album were new versions of the tracks that had appeared on Within Temptation&#x27;s demos. It was recorded in Studio Moskou, Utrecht, and it was completed and mixed within three weeks.

Robert Westerholt remembers that &quot;it was incomparable to the first recordings we did earlier, this one was much more professional. After all a nice experience, but a very quick one. &#x27;Enter&#x27; was recorded in two weeks and mixed in three days, so it was very difficult for we couldn&#x27;t take time to develop songs. But it was a nice experience - it was our first album!&quot; Vocalist Sharon den Adel recalls that &quot;I only had one and a half days to record my parts and it was quite hectic, just a short warm-up and then &#x27;Go&#x27;!&quot; Lex Vogelaar, founder of the Dutch death metal band Orphanage, supplied the guitar parts for the track &quot;Pearls of Light&quot;. Orphanage vocalist George Oosthoek performed some of the growls on &quot;Deep Within&quot;.

===Style===
The album&#x27;s style &quot;sits between gothic metal and doom&quot; and is very instrumental compared to the band&#x27;s later works. Many of the songs have longer instrumental sections and fewer lyrics. On several songs Westerholt provides growling (in contrast to later albums on which it is rarely used). The lyrics focus on darkness, ghosts, and wars instead of the more common fantasy, love, and nature-centred lyrics found on later albums.

==Future of the album==
Although it didn&#x27;t enter the Dutch albums chart in its release year, &quot;Enter&quot; eventually rose to No. 32 in 2002, after the great success of the song &quot;Ice Queen&quot;. The album, along with &quot;The Dance&quot; were re-released in the US on 18 September 2007 by the label Season of Mist. After the great reception of later albums and the Hydra World Tour, Nuclear Blast decided to release a together re-issue of both &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;The Dance&quot; on 10 November 2014, in order to give the new listeners access to the band&#x27;s early material. By the end of 2018, the band released the album for the first time on vinyl format. It then entered the Dutch Vinyl Charts on number 6.

==Live history==

Songs from &quot;Enter&quot; were played live during Within Temptation&#x27;s shows between 1997 and 1998. After that, only &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;Deep Within&quot; were played regularly during the &quot;Mother Earth Tour&quot;.

As of 2004, songs from the album &quot;Enter&quot; are not performed regularly anymore by Within Temptation. The title track and &quot;Candles&quot; were performed at the major concert at the Java Island in Amsterdam during The Silent Force Tour. &quot;Enter&quot; was last played at London in 2005, but &quot;Candles&quot; was played a few times in 2006 and at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp on 9 May 2012, during the 15-year anniversary concert &quot;Elements&quot;; the concert was released in November 2014 as part of the Blu-Ray/CD set called &quot;Let Us Burn – Elements &amp; Hydra Live in Concert&quot;.

The only single from the album, &quot;Restless&quot;, was performed again a few times during The Heart of Everything World Tour in 2007, being performed at shows in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK throughout October and November, and also the 2007 Fanclub Day in July. It was played once in Brazil in 2008 and then on the band&#x27;s Sanctuary Theater Tour in 2012. At the eleventh version of the Metal Female Voices Fest, in October 2013, former Within Temptation member Martijn Westerholt, nowadays with Delain, played the song live with Sharon den Adel as a guest vocalist.

<doc id="623591" wikidata="Q181480" url="?curid=623591" title="Battle of Vítkov Hill">
<text>The Battle of Vítkov Hill was a part of the Hussite Wars. The battle pitted the forces of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, against Hussite forces under command of Jan Žižka (in English, John Zizka). Vítkov Hill was located on the edge of the city of Prague and the battle occurred in a vineyard established by Sigismund&#x27;s father, Charles IV. It ended with a decisive Hussite victory.

==Background==
On 1 March 1420 Pope Martin V published a papal bull in which he ordered that Sigismund and all Eastern princes had to organize a crusade against the Hussite followers of Jan Hus, John Wycliffe and other heretics. On 15 March in Wrocław, Emperor Sigismund ordered the execution of Jan Krása, a Hussite and leader of the Wrocław Uprising in 1418. On 17 March, the papal legate Ferdinand de Palacios published the bull in Wrocław. Then, the Utraquist faction of Hussites understood that they would not reach an agreement with him. They united with Taborite Hussites and decided to defend against the emperor.

The crusaders assembled their army in Świdnica. On 4 April, Taborite forces destroyed Catholic forces in Mladá Vožice. On 7 April, Taborites, commanded by Nicholas of Hus, captured Sedlice, and they later captured Písek, Rábí Castle, Strakonice and Prachatice. In late April, the crusading army crossed the Bohemian border. In early May, they captured Hradec Králové. On 7 May Čeněk of Wartenberg surrounded Hradčany.

===Battles in Benešov and near Kutná Hora===
The Crusader force of 400 infantry and knights, commanded by Peter of Sternberg, attempted to defend Benešov from the Taborites. After the battle, the crusader forces were destroyed, and the town was burned. Near Kutná Hora, the crusader forces, commanded by Janek z Chtěnic and Pippo Spano (Filippo Scolari), attacked the formations of the Taborites, without success.

On 22 May, the Taborite forces entered Prague. Jan Žižka destroyed the crusaders&#x27; relief column, which had to secure supplies that were sent to Hradčany and Vyšehrad. Meanwhile, the crusading army captured Slaný, Louny and Mělník.

==Battle==

The siege of Prague began on 12 June. The crusaders&#x27; forces were reported contemporaneously by chroniclers to number 100,000–200,000 soldiers, but according to modern historian Victor Verney, it was significantly fewer, probably only about 8,000 soldiers. When the crusaders approached the city, they knew a direct attack on the walls would be disastrous, so they planned to encircle it. To do this, all of the fortifications around Prague would need to be destroyed or occupied. The crusaders committed most of their forces to these raids in an attempt to prevent the defenders at key points from being reinforced by the Prague garrison. 

===Vítkov Hill===
One of the most important of these fortifications surrounding Prague was Vítkov Hill, which dominated the area east of Prague and overlooked roads needed for the crusaders&#x27; supply lines. The fortifications on the hill were made primarily from timber, with the walls reinforced with stone and clay and moats dug around the base of the hill. On the southern part of the hill was a free-standing tower made from timber, and the remaining northern flank was covered by a steep cliff. Traditionally, the fortifications were said to be defended by Žižka with only 26 men and 3 women under his command, but it was probably higher—60 or more soldiers, according to J. Durdik—and it is unclear if Žižka was on the hill. The men on the hill were armed mostly with guns and flails. On 13 July, the crusaders&#x27; cavalry crossed the river Vltava and began their attack on the outer ring of fortifications. Vítkov Hill was attacked by a detachment of Austrian and Meissen cavalry under Heinrich of Isenburg, governor of Meissen. An hour before sunset, the horsemen advanced from the south towards the hill, but the terrain and fortifications of the hill forced them down a narrow path and prevented them from utilizing their greater numbers. The tenacity of the defenders held the attackers off for some time, but the heavily outnumbered Hussites were slowly pushed back. Shortly thereafter, reinforcements from the garrison of the New Town broke off and headed towards Vítkov Hill, outflanking the knights and attack through the vineyards on the southern slope. Trapped between the counter-attack and the steep cliff on the northern slope, the crusaders quickly panicked as they were forced off the hill. As they retreated, many knights drowned in the Vltava.

The battle was a clear victory for the Hussites. The crusaders lost between 
400-500 knights. In honour of the battle, Vítkov Hill was renamed Žižkov after Jan Žižka. As a consequence of the Hussite victory on Vítkov, the crusaders lost any hope of starving the city into submission and their army disintegrated. The National Monument still exists on the hill, and in 2003, local officials were attempting to replant the vineyard.

Sigismund and his troops then held the castles of Vyšehrad and Hradčany. However, they soon capitulated, and Sigismund had to withdraw from Prague. The crusaders later withdrew to Kutná Hora and began local warfare.
