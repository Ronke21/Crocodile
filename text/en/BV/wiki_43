<text>Wang Shouren (, 26 October 1472 – 9 January 1529), courtesy name Bo&#x27;an (), art name Yangmingzi (), usually referred to as Wang Yangming (), was a Chinese philosopher, general, politician, writer, and calligrapher during the Ming dynasty. After Zhu Xi, he is commonly regarded as the most important Neo-Confucian thinker, for his interpretations of Confucianism that denied the rationalist dualism of the orthodox philosophy of Zhu Xi. Wang and Lu Xiangshan are regarded as the founders as the Lu–Wang school, or the School of the Mind.

In China, Japan, and Western countries, he is known by his honorific name rather than his private name.

==Life and times==

Wang was born in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, to a scholarly family with a tradition of bureaucratic service. His father, Wang Hua, was first (&quot;Zhuangyuan&quot;, 狀元) in the Imperial Examination of 1481, and rose to become the vice-minister of the Ministry of Rites, but was later demoted and subsequently expelled from government service for having offended Liu Jin, a eunuch.

Wang earned the &quot;juren&quot; degree in 1492 and the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree in 1499. He later served as an executive assistant in various government departments until banishment for offending a eunuch in 1506. However, his professional career resumed when he became the Governor of Jiangxi.

===Military exploits===
Wang became a successful general and was known for the strict discipline he imposed on his troops. In 1517 and 1518, he was dispatched in response to petitions to suppress peasant revolts in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong. Concerned with the destruction that came with war, he petitioned the court to allow amnesty, and successfully destroyed rebel military forces.

====Suppressing the Prince of Ning rebellion====
In 1519 AD, while he was governor of Jiangxi province and on his way to suppress the revolts in Fujian, Wang was suddenly faced with the Prince of Ning rebellion, led by Zhu Chenhao the fourth Prince of Ning. Given that the prince&#x27;s base in Nanchang allowed him to sail down the Yangtze River and capture the southern capital of Nanjing, Wang actively prepared for battle to prevent that possibility, while engaging in deception to convince the prince that armies were moving to surround him. The prince, deceived by this, hesitated and gave time for Nanjing to be reinforced. Eventually, forced to engage governmental forces, the Prince of Ning was defeated and captured.

In this campaign, Wang also made one of the earliest references to using the &quot;fo-lang-ji&quot; in battle, a breech loading culverin cannon imported from the newly arrived Portuguese venturers to China. As governor of Jiangxi he also built schools, rehabilitated the rebels, and reconstructed what was lost by the enemy during the revolt. Though he was made an earl, he was ostracized for opposing Zhu Xi.

Thirty-eight years after his death, he was given the titles Marquis and Completion of Culture. In 1584 he was offered sacrifice in the Confucian Temple, the highest honour for a scholar.

==Philosophy==
Wang was the leading figure in the Neo-Confucian School of heart, founded by Lu Jiuyuan (陸九淵, or Lu Xiangshan) of the Southern Song. This school championed an interpretation of Mencius, a Classical Confucian who became the focus of later interpretation, that unified knowledge with action. Their rival school, the School of Principle (&quot;Li&quot;) treated gaining knowledge as a kind of preparation or cultivation that, when completed, could guide action.

===Innate knowing===
Out of Cheng-Zhu&#x27;s Neo-Confucianism that was mainstream at the time, Wang Yangming developed the idea of &quot;innate knowing&quot;, arguing that every person knows from birth the difference between good and evil. Wang claimed that such knowledge is intuitive and not rational. These revolutionizing ideas of Wang Yangming would later inspire prominent Japanese thinkers like Motoori Norinaga, who argued that because of the Shinto deities, Japanese people alone had the intuitive ability to distinguish good and evil without complex rationalization. His school of thought (&quot;Ōyōmei-gaku&quot; in Japanese, &quot;Ō&quot; stands for the surname &quot;Wang&quot;, &quot;yōmei&quot; stands for &quot;Yangming&quot;, &quot;gaku&quot; stands for &quot;school of learning&quot;) also greatly influenced the Japanese samurai ethic.

===Integration of Knowledge and Action===

Wang&#x27;s rejection of the pure investigation of knowledge comes from the then traditional view of Chinese belief that once one gained knowledge, one had a duty to put that knowledge into action. This presupposed two possibilities:
That one can have knowledge without/prior to corresponding action or that one can know what is the proper action, but still fail to act.

Wang rejected both of these which allowed him to develop his philosophy of action. Wang believed that 
only through spontaneous action could one gain knowledge and denied all other ways of gaining it. To him, there was no way to use knowledge after gaining it because he believed that knowledge and action were unified as one. Any knowledge that had been gained &quot;then put&quot; into action was considered delusion or false.

===Mind and the world===
He held that objects do not exist entirely apart from the mind because the mind shapes them. He believed that it is not the world that shapes the mind, but the mind that gives reason to the world. Therefore, the mind alone is the source of all reason. He understood this to be an inner light, an innate moral goodness and understanding of what is good.

In order to eliminate selfish desires that cloud the mind&#x27;s understanding of goodness, one can practice his type of meditation often called &quot;tranquil repose&quot; or &quot;sitting still&quot; (靜坐 &quot;jingzuo&quot;). This is similar to the practice of Chan (Zen) meditation in Buddhism.

== Influence ==
Wang Yangming is regarded one of the greatest masters of Confucianism in history along with Confucius, Mencius and Zhu Xi ().
He founded &quot;Yaojiang School&quot; () or &quot;Yangming School of Mind&quot; (), which became one of the dominant Confucian schools in the mid-late Ming period and Qing period China. The typical figures came from this school after Wang were Wang Ji (), Qian Dehong (), Wang Gen, Huang Zongxi, Li Zhuowu and Liu Zongzhou (). Wang Gen formed &quot;Taizhou School&quot; (), which went left of Wang Yangming&#x27;s thought. During the late Ming period, Wang Yangming&#x27;s thought became notably popular and influential in China.
Wang&#x27;s interpretation of Confucianism has been influential in China into modern times. The twentieth-century Chinese warlord Yan Xishan attempted to revive Confucianism in Shanxi largely on the model of Wang&#x27;s philosophy.
The teachings of Wang Yangming were credited with inspiring many Japanese reformers and revolutionaries during the nineteenth century. This led to a great increase in interest in his thought in Japan at the end of the Meiji period, when many Chinese activists such as Liang Qichao and Chiang Kai-shek were staying in Japan. Some Chinese and Korean thinkers believed that Wang Yangming&#x27;s teachings strongly influenced the development of modern bushido (the &quot;way of the warrior&quot;) in Japan, and promoted both ethics in their countries to strengthen the spirit of their respective peoples.

The Japanese Admiral of the Russo-Japanese War, Tōgō Heihachirō, was influenced by Wang, and made a stamp which read, &quot;One&#x27;s whole life followed the example of Yangming&quot; (). In Japan, many scholars and politicians (this group of people is known in Japanese as &quot;Yōmeigakusha&quot; () came from Wang Yangming&#x27;s school (&quot;Ōyōmei-gaku&quot;) in history, including Kumazawa Banzan, Saigō Takamori, Takasugi Shinsaku and Nakae Tōju. Toju Nakae is regarded as the founder of Japanese &quot;Ōyōmei-gaku&quot;.

==Memorials==

Chiang Kai-shek named a national attraction in Taiwan, Yangmingshan, after Wang; and a road in Nanchang is also named &quot;Yangming Road&quot; after Wang by Chiang-influenced local officials. Additionally, National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan is also named after the philosopher.
People in Guiyang, provincial capital of Guizhou Province, dedicated a statue to Wang Yangming as well as a museum and theme park; a robot version of Wang Yangming is in the city.
The city government in Wang&#x27;s hometown, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, named a middle school after his honorific name.

<text>Paul Götz (1883–1962) was a German astronomer and discoverer of 20 minor planets between 1903 and 1905.

He did his Ph.D. dissertation in 1907 at the &quot;Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl&quot; (Königstuhl Observatory, near Heidelberg) at the University of Heidelberg.

At the time, the observatory at Heidelberg was a center for asteroid discovery under the direction of Max Wolf, and several past and future fellow Ph.D.s (Raymond Smith Dugan, Joseph Helffrich, Franz Kaiser, Karl Reinmuth, Emil Ernst, Alfred Bohrmann) made a number of asteroid discoveries. Thus the asteroid discoveries by &quot;P. Gotz&quot; at Heidelberg in this time frame are undoubtedly identified with the Paul Götz who got his Ph.D. in 1907.

The main-belt asteroid 2278 Götz was named in his memory in 1991 ().

<text>Mark Eugene Gruenwald ( ; June 18, 1953 – August 12, 1996) was an American comic book writer, editor, and occasional penciler known for his long association with Marvel Comics.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Gruenwald got his start in comics fandom, publishing his own fanzine, &quot;Omniverse&quot;, which explored the concept of continuity. Before being hired by Marvel, he wrote text articles for DC Comics’ official fanzine, &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics&quot;. Articles by Gruenwald include &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (a history of the Martian Manhunter) in issue #13 and several articles on the history of the Justice League in issue #14.

=== Entry to Marvel ===
In 1978 he was hired by Marvel Comics, where he remained for the rest of his career. Hired initially as an assistant editor in January 1978, Gruenwald was promoted to full editorship by Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter in 1982, putting Gruenwald in charge of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Spider Woman&quot;, and &quot;What If&quot;. During this period, he shared an office with writer/editor Denny O&#x27;Neil, whom Gruenwald considered a mentor.

=== Penciler ===
During the years 1982–1984, Gruenwald did fill-in pencil work for a handful of Marvel comics, most notably the 1983 &quot;Hawkeye&quot; limited series, but also issues of &quot;What If?&quot;, &quot;Marvel Team-Up Annual&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, and &quot;Questprobe&quot;.

The cover of &quot;Comic Reader&quot; #180 (May–June 1980) featuring Hawkman and Adam Strange and the entry for Merlyn the Archer in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who: the Definitive Directory of the DC Universe&quot; #15 (May 1986) were Gruenwald&#x27;s only comics artwork outside of Marvel.

=== Writer ===
In 1982, Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo co-wrote &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot;, the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. As a writer, Gruenwald is best known for creating the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; and his ten-year stint as the writer of &quot;Captain America&quot; (from 1985 to 1995) – during which he contributed several notable characters such as Crossbones, Diamondback and U.S. Agent. He made a deliberate effort to create villains who would be specific to Captain America, as opposed to generic foes who could as easily have been introduced in another comic. At one point Gruenwald owned a replica of Captain America&#x27;s shield – the same shield now owned by Stephen Colbert.

His 60-issue run on &quot;Quasar&quot; (1989–1994) realized Gruenwald&#x27;s ambition to write his own kind of superhero. However, he considered his magnum opus to be the mid-1980s 12-issue maxiseries &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot;, which told the story of an alternate universe where a group of well-intended superheroes decide that they would be best suited to run the planet. Gruenwald was highly loyal to each series he wrote. In addition to his lengthy stint on &quot;Captain America&quot;, he wrote the entire runs of both &quot;Quasar&quot; (save for one issue) and &quot;D.P.7&quot;, and Jim Salicrup recalled that when Gruenwald was taken off of &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; after only 12 issues, he &quot;was crushed.&quot;

=== Executive editor ===

On September 1, 1987, Gruenwald became Marvel&#x27;s executive editor, with a particular remit as the keeper of continuity. Gruenwald was famous for a perfect recollection of even the most trivial details.

In the pages of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, Walt Simonson paid homage to Gruenwald by having the Time Variance Authority (TVA)&#x27;s staff all be clones of Gruenwald; no one could keep track of everything but him.

Gruenwald was a recurring character with Tom DeFalco in the single-panel comic &quot;The Bull&#x27;s Eye&quot; that ran in Marvel comics in the late 1980s–early 1990s, created by Rick Parker and Barry Dutter. These strips, which ran on the Bullpen Bulletins page during the majority of DeFalco&#x27;s run as editor-in-chief, featured Gruenwald depicted as a caricature and foil for DeFalco&#x27;s antics.

== Personal life and death ==
Gruenwald married singer Belinda Glass in May 1981. They later divorced, and he married Catherine Schuller on October 12, 1992, in New York after a year&#x27;s courtship; she was the executor of Gruenwald&#x27;s famous will. Gruenwald had a daughter, Sara.

In 1996, Gruenwald succumbed to a heart attack, the result of an unsuspected congenital heart defect. Gruenwald was a well-known practical joker and, due to his young age, many of his friends and co-workers initially believed the reports of his death to be just another joke. Just days prior, he had done one of his trademark cartwheels down the halls of the Bullpen. A longtime lover of comics, Gruenwald made it known among his friends and family that his one desire was to have his ashes used in part of a comic. In accordance with his request, he was cremated, and his ashes were mixed with the ink used to print the first printing of the trade paperback compilation of &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Amalgam Comics book &quot;The Exciting X-Patrol&quot; #1 (June 1997) and the Marvel Comics book &quot;Generation X&quot; #21 (November 1996) are dedicated to Gruenwald&#x27;s memory as was &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; #75 which saw the return of Norman Osborn after his supposed death twenty years earlier.

In the DC Universe, a building in Gotham City was named the &quot;Von Gruenwald Tower&quot;, and in the novel &quot;Captain America: Liberty&#x27;s Torch&quot; written by Tony Isabella and Bob Ingersoll, the lawyer kidnapped to defend the similarly kidnapped Captain America in a mock trial before a militia is named Mark Gruenwald, and is described with the same general physical attributes and personality as the real Gruenwald. The lawyer acts heroically throughout the story.

In Richard Starkings&#x27; &quot;Elephantmen&quot;, the executive director of the Information Agency where almost all of the main characters of the series work is called Gruenwald and bears a strong resemblance to Gruenwald. In an interview with Newsarama, Richard Starkings confirmed that the character was based on his friend.

In volume four of &quot;Nova&quot; from Marvel Comics, the new director of Project Pegasus is named Dr. Gruenwald.

In 2006, Gruenwald was officially named the &quot;Patron Saint of Marveldom&quot; in the new &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; pages.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) show &quot;Loki&quot;, TVA analyst Mobius M. Mobius is portrayed by Owen Wilson, and is made to resemble Gruenwald&#x27;s likeness.

Jason Olsen&#x27;s &quot;Mark Gruenwald and the Star Spangled Symbolism of Captain America, 1985-1995,&quot; a book about Gruenwald&#x27;s run on &quot;Captain America,&quot; was published by McFarland &amp; Company in 2021.

<text>Emil Ernst (6 June 1889– 26 June 1942) was a German astronomer and discoverer of a minor planet.

He did his PhD dissertation in 1918 at the Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl (Heidelberg Observatory) at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg in southern Germany.

At the time, the observatory at Heidelberg was a center for asteroid discovery under the direction of Max Wolf. During his time there, Ernst discovered the main-belt asteroid 705 Erminia.

<text>Eduardo Kac (born July 3, 1962) is a Brazilian and American contemporary artist whose portfolio encompasses various forms of art including performance art, poetry, holography, interactive art, digital and online art, and BioArt. Recognized for his space art and transgenic works, Kac works with biotechnology to create organisms with new genetic attributes. His interdisciplinary approach has seen the use of diverse mediums, from fax and photocopying to fractals, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, virtual reality and DNA synthesis.

==Life==
Kac was born July 3, 1962, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He became fluent in English as a child. He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985, and then at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received an MFA degree in 1990. In 2003 he received a doctorate from the Planetary Collegium at the University of Wales, Great Britain. Kac is a professor of art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

== Art career ==
Kac began his art career in 1980 as a performance artist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1982 he created his first digital work and in 1983 he invented holopoetry, exploring holography as an interactive art form. In 1985 he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.

Throughout the 1980s Kac created telecommunications artworks, using media such as fax, television, and slow scan TV. In 1986 Kac created his first work of telepresence art, in which he used robots to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, expanding his practice with works of interspecies communications.

Kac coined the term &quot;bio art&quot;. Kac also created various terms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including biorobotics (functional merger of robotics and biotechnology), plantimal (plant with animal genetic material or animal with plant genetic material), and transgenic art (the expression of genes from one species in another in an artwork).

Early notable works include &quot;Genesis&quot; (1999), where Kac translated a Genesis line into morse code and subsequently into DNA base pair and &quot;GFP Bunny&quot; (2000), where an albino rabbit was genetically altered with a jellyfish gene, causing it to emit a green glow under specific light conditions. This piece ignited extensive debates on the ethical implications of altering life forms for artistic purposes.

Kac&#x27;s focus on space art encompasses decades-long effort to complete &quot;Ágora&quot; (1986–2023), a project designed for deep space. Over the years, he has collaborated with both NASA and SpaceX. His collaboration with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet in &quot;Inner Telescope&quot; (2017) led to the creation of a sculpture in space. Another of his artworks, &quot;Adsum&quot;, made its journey to the International Space Station in 2022, in preparation for its final flight to the Moon. Kac has been an active participant in events promoting the convergence of art and space exploration, such as those organized by the Space Observatory, an office of France&#x27;s National Center for Space Studies.

=== 1980s ===

In 1980 Kac launched the Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement) on Ipanema Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, with the stated goal of subverting the logic of normative pornography at the service of activism and imagination. Working under the extremely conservative political climate of Brazil under a military dictatorship, Kac and other Movement members, such as Glauco Mattoso, Leila Míccolis, and Hudinilson Jr., developed the new body-centered aesthetics collectively until 1982. Kac was also a performer with the Gang, the performance unit of the Movimento de Arte Pornô; the Gang performed in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other cities.

Beginning in 1982, Kac started to create digital works. In 1983 Kac invented holographic poetry (which he also called holopoetry), the first of which was &quot;HOLO/OLHO&quot;, named after the Portuguese word for &quot;eye&quot;. 23 holographic poems followed this first work, including &quot;Quando?&quot; (When?) (1987), a cylindrical work that could be read in two directions.

Around the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French Minitel system that was then in use in Brazil. In 1985 he contributed one such work, &quot;Reabracadabra&quot;, to the &quot;Arte On Line&quot; exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in São Paulo. Other Minitel animated poems by Kac include &quot;Recaos&quot; (1986), &quot;Tesão&quot; (1985/86) and &quot;D/eu/s&quot; (1986). In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the &quot;Brasil High-Tech&quot; exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.

From 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications artworks that used Slow-scan television (SSTV), FAX, and live television, to create interactive exchanges between separate locations.

In 1986 Kac created his first telepresence artwork, using a robot to connect distant audiences. In 1988 he began work on his &quot;Ornitorrinco&quot; project, a telepresence artwork completed in Chicago, in 1989, in collaboration with Ed Bennett. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot&#x27;s camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.

In 1989 Kac moved from Rio de Janeiro to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with &quot;Dialogical Drawing&quot; (1994) and &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two sites in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation. The inclusion of a bird and a plant as part of an interactive system is an early example of what Kac called interspecies communications.

In 1996, Kac&#x27;s space artwork &quot;Monogram&quot; was included in the DVD that flew to Saturn mounted to the side of the Cassini spacecraft.

&quot;In Teleporting An Unknown State&quot; (1994), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by direct sunlight but by the action of local or remote viewers of the work. In practice, local or remote viewers of the work selected from a set of webcams facing the sky of distant cities. A video projector above the plant relayed the webcam images to the plant, thus enabling it to do photosynthesis with light transmitted remotely. As a result, the system transmitted light values (frequency and amplitude) from distant skies to a local plant.

Kac coined the term &quot;bio art&quot; with his 1997 performance work &quot;Time Capsule&quot;. In &quot;Time Capsule&quot;, Kac implanted himself with an RFID chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian gallery where Kac was performing, causing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so. &quot;Time Capsule&quot; was simultaneously live on television and the Internet.
By the late 90s Kac defined himself either as a &quot;transgenic artist&quot; or a &quot;bio artist&quot;, and was using biotechnology and genetics to create works that used scientific techniques and simultaneously critiqued them.

Kac&#x27;s next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled &quot;Genesis&quot;, involved him taking a quote from the Bible (Genesis 1:26 – &quot;Let man have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth&quot;), transferring it into Morse code, and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics. The new DNA sequence was introduced into bacteria. Participants were then able to shine ultraviolet lights onto the bacteria containing the new DNA, thus altering it. So when Kac translated it back to English, it said something completely different. Through this work, Kac encourages audiences to consider the new interconnectedness between biology, technology, and meaning.

===2000s===
In one of his best known works, &quot;GFP Bunny&quot;, presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac claimed to have commisioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent rabbit; a rabbit born with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene from a type of jellyfish. Kac named the rabbit Alba. Under a specific UV light, the rabbit fluoresces green. &quot;GFP Bunny&quot; proved to be hugely controversial, in part due to the unprecedented nature of the artwork, in part because of the general lack of familiarity with the safety of the process at the close of the twentieth century.

Kac&#x27;s claimed that his original aim was for Alba to live with his family, but that prior to the scheduled release of Alba to Kac, the lab retracted their agreement and decided that Alba should remain in the lab. Kac responded by creating a series of works that called for her freedom. Other works would follow, focused on celebrating her life. In reality, Kac had only met Alba on his visit to the French lab. And while he had the consent of Houdebine to go in debate, the institution never agreed to public appearance of their GFP rabbits. When Kac&#x27;s plea to get Alba was denied he went on to publish the artificially green photos, and declared it was his commission, and accused the institute of censorship.

GFP Bunny appeared in Big Bang Theory, Sherlock, and Simpsons, and in novels such as &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, by Margaret Atwood, and &quot;Next&quot;, by Michael Crichton.

His work &quot;Natural History of the Enigma&quot; (2003–2008) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a petunia, creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a plantimal. The plant, also given the name Edunia (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac&#x27;s DNA only with the plant&#x27;s genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.

===2010s===
In 2017 Kac collaborated with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet to create an artwork in space called &quot;Inner Telescope&quot;, an artwork conceived for zero gravity and made aboard the International Space Station. Kac worked with the French Space Observatory office, from the French Space Agency, to have this work made in space by the astronaut Thomas Pesquet. Following Kac&#x27;s instructions, Pesquet cut and folded two pieces of paper into a sculptural form. Floating in zero gravity, the form could be read as the three letters forming the French word for me, M-O-I, or a stylized human figure with the umbilical cord cut.

===2020s===
Since 2019, Kac has been developing &quot;Adsum, an artwork for the Moon&quot;. Conceived in five phases, as of 2022 Kac had completed the first three milestones. &quot;Adsum&quot; is a glass artwork with four visual symbols internally laser-engraved in three dimensions and is meant to exist in the lunar environment. The four symbols that constitute the work are: an hourglass (representing time at a human scale), two circles (one large, representing the Earth; one small, representing the Moon), and the infinity symbol (representing time at a cosmic scale).

==Controversy==
Eduardo Kac&#x27;s work has frequently been an object of debate. One of the most prominent instances arose from his artwork &quot;GFP Bunny&quot; in 2000. The piece centered around Alba, an albino rabbit that was genetically engineered by incorporating the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a jellyfish into her genome. This resulted in the rabbit possessing the ability to glow green under blue light. Some critics and animal rights activists raised concerns about the ethical implications of such genetic manipulation purely for the sake of art.

Kac&#x27;s later project, &quot;Inner Telescope&quot;, created inside the International Space Station (ISS), stirred debate of a different kind. The artwork, crafted from paper and designed to spell &quot;Moi&quot; (French for &quot;me&quot;), was a conceptual play on individual and collective self. The philosophical depth and utility of such an endeavor was questioned, particularly in the context of contemporary societal challenges. The project was also critiqued for potentially being an escape from the urgent issues on Earth, rather than addressing them head-on.

==Permanent collections==
Kac&#x27;s work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Modern, London, Institut Valencià d&#x27;Art Modern in Valencia, Spain, Reina Sophia Museum, Madrid, Spain, Les Abattoirs Toulouse, France, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Several of Kac&#x27;s artist&#x27;s books are included in the library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

==Awards==
In 1998 he received the Leonardo Award for Excellence from ISAST. In 1999, he received the Inter Communication Center (Tokyo) Biennial Award in 1999.

In 2002 he received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Emerging Fields.

In 2008 he received the Golden Nica award at Ars Electronica for his project &quot;Natural History of the Enigma&quot;.

<doc id="619546" wikidata="Q599109" url="?curid=619546" title="Mark Bagley">
<text>Mark Bagley (; born August 7, 1957) is an American comics artist. He has worked for Marvel Comics on such titles as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, &quot;New Warriors&quot;, &quot;Venom&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; and for DC Comics on &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Trinity&quot;.

==Early life==
Mark Bagley was born to a military family in Frankfurt, West Germany.

==Career==
After his work in the military and at Ringling College of Art and Design, Bagley continued trying to break into the comic industry. While working a construction job, he suffered a severe injury to his leg while using a handsaw that required 132 stitches. He eventually ended up working for Lockheed Martin making technical drawings.

===Marvel Comics===
In 1983, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter created the &quot;Marvel Try-out Book&quot; to draw new talent into the comic book industry. The contest involved a deconstructed comic book which contestants could complete and submit to Marvel. The winner would be awarded a professional assignment with Marvel. At the time, Bagley was 27 years old and living in Marietta, Georgia. He had almost given up on trying to find a job in comics and was satisfied with his position at Lockheed Martin. Bagley was reluctant to enter the contest because of the cost of the &quot;Try-out Book&quot; itself. His friend, Cliff Biggers, gave him the book and persuaded Bagley to enter the contest. Bagley won first place for penciling, finishing ahead of thousands of other hopefuls. After winning the contest, he did not hear from Marvel for several months. After approaching Shooter at a comic convention, Bagley was assigned to a series of low-profile penciling jobs. His comics work during this period included &quot;&quot;, a comic book based on a 1980s toy line, various titles in the New Universe line, backup stories in &quot;Captain America&quot;, and the first series of Marvel Universe Cards.

In 1989, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz created a team of teenage superheroes called the New Warriors. The following year, Marvel launched a new series based on these heroes and assigned Bagley and writer Fabian Nicieza to the title. Bagley stayed on the title until #25, at which point he left to transition directly onto &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot;

When Erik Larsen left &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in 1991, Bagley was assigned to the title. He and David Michelinie introduced the Carnage character in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #361 (April 1992) and produced the &quot;&quot; limited series in 1993. Although not the first artist to draw either Venom or Eddie Brock, Bagley&#x27;s version of both characters are widely considered to be the most popular versions of them by fans. Bagley was one of the artists on the &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot; and &quot;Clone Saga&quot; storylines which ran through the Spider-Man titles. Bagley&#x27;s artwork was used extensively for licensed material, appearing on everything from plates and cups to credit cards and even video games such &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes&quot; released exclusively in Japan. In 2012, Comic Book Resources ranked Bagley fourth on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Spider-Man Creators&quot;.

In 1997, Bagley collaborated with writer Kurt Busiek on a new team of superheroes, the Thunderbolts, a group of super-villains disguised as super-heroes, with the final page of the first issue of the series revealing that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel.

In 2000, Marvel&#x27;s then-publisher Bill Jemas was looking to relaunch Marvel&#x27;s primary franchises in a way that would make them accessible to newer readers. &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; would be a title that began the Spider-Man mythos from the beginning set in modern times. Bagley was assigned to &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; with writer Brian Michael Bendis. The Bendis/Bagley partnership of 111 consecutive issues made their partnership one of the longest in American comic book history, and the longest run by a Marvel creative team, beating out Stan Lee and Jack Kirby on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Bagley collaborated with Bendis on &quot;The Pulse&quot; and a four-issue arc on &quot;Mighty Avengers&quot;.

Bagley&#x27;s long and successful run on &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; earned him recognition in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten artists of the 2000s in &quot;Wizard&quot; #219. Ranked #2 on the list, article writer Mark Allen Haverty noted of Bagley, &quot;no other artist came close to the number of comics Bagley sold [in the 2000s], nor the number of Top 20 comics he was a part of.&quot;

===DC Comics===
In 2008, Bagley signed an exclusive three-year contract with DC Comics. His first assignment as a DC exclusive, the &quot;Trinity&quot; weekly series written by Kurt Busiek featured Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.

Bagley drew four issues of &quot;Batman&quot;, written by Judd Winick. This was in the post-&quot;&quot; world, with Dick Grayson having taken over as the Dark Knight. Bagley then teamed with writer James Robinson on &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. Bagley drew most of issues #38–53.

===Return to Marvel===
In 2011, Bagley left DC and returned to Marvel and &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;. He reunited with writer Brian Michael Bendis and drew the &quot;Death of Spider-Man&quot; arc in issues #156–160. As he started the Ultimate imprint alongside Bendis, he was also called for &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, &quot;Ultimate End&quot; (which ended the imprint) and the last pages of &quot;Spider-Men II&quot; (which set up its return). Bagley and Bendis teamed for a creator-owned series, &quot;Brilliant&quot;, which was published through Marvel&#x27;s Icon Comics Imprint. It has similarities to Mark Millar&#x27;s own Icon comic, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, as it explores the idea of superheroes existing in the real world, however unlike &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, the characters have actual super-powers.

Brian Michael Bendis and Bagley worked on &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, an Avengers title produced concurrently with &quot;Brilliant&quot;. To differentiate between other &quot;Avengers&quot; titles, &quot;Assemble&quot; consisted of the roster present in the &quot;Avengers&quot; film, but set in present Marvel continuity.

As part of the Marvel NOW! initiative, Bagley and writer Matt Fraction relaunched the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series in 2012. Bagley and Mark Waid collaborated on a &quot;Hulk&quot; series in 2014.

In late 2017, Bagley made a return to Venom with issue #155, &quot;Lethal Protector&quot;, written by Mike Costa. This brief return lasted only four issues.

==Art quirks==
According to Bagley, drawing crowd scenes are his &quot;weak point&quot;, because he becomes worn out on them, and finds them difficult to render in a timely fashion. He dislikes drawing Captain America.

==Personal life==
Bagley and his wife Pattie have a daughter, Angie.

<text>Marc Silvestri (born March 29, 1958) is an American comic book artist, creator and publisher. He is CEO of Top Cow Productions and Image Comics.

==Early life==
Marc Silvestri was born on March 29, 1958, in Palm Beach, Florida. Silvestri first discovered comics through his cousin, who was an avid collector. It was during visits to his cousin&#x27;s house that Silvestri would become familiar with artists such as Jack Kirby, Bernie Wrightson, and John Buscema. Silvestri names Wrightson, Buscema, and Frank Frazetta as his biggest influences.

==Career==
Silvestri began his career drawing issues for DC Comics and First Comics. He joined Marvel Comics in the mid-1980s (having earlier guest pencilled for Marvel as early as 1982 on Master of Kung Fu issue 119), and became the penciller on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; from 1987 to 1990. He subsequently spent two years pencilling its spin-off title &quot;Wolverine&quot;.

In 1992, Silvestri became one of the original seven artists (along with Jim Lee, Whilce Portacio, Rob Liefeld, Erik Larsen, Todd McFarlane, and Jim Valentino) to form the breakaway comics company Image Comics. Silvestri&#x27;s stable of titles was published under the imprint Top Cow with the first title released being &quot;Cyberforce&quot;. Besides his art, Silvestri was also scripter (and co-plotter) on the Top Cow title &quot;&quot;. Many of Silvestri&#x27;s stories were scripted by his brother, Eric Silvestri.

Disputes among the Image partners led to Silvestri briefly leaving the publisher in 1996, but he returned after Liefeld severed his own ties with Image.

Top Cow&#x27;s successes include the titles &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;The Darkness&quot;, &quot;Inferno Hellbound&quot; (publication of which was interrupted for unknown reasons), and &quot;Fathom&quot;.

Silvestri produced the story and preliminary character sketches for the 1997 video game &quot;Fighting Force&quot;.

In 2004, Silvestri made a brief return to Marvel to pencil several issues of &quot;X-Men&quot;, collaborating with writer Grant Morrison. Later in the year, he launched a new Top Cow title, &quot;Hunter-Killer&quot; with writer Mark Waid. He provided covers for the Marvel Comics mini-series, &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot; by Ed Brubaker and Trevor Hairsine.

In June 2006, Top Cow released &quot;Cyberforce&quot; #0 featuring art by Silvestri.

In late 2007 (cover date December), he pencilled the &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot; one-shot, as well as many covers in the crossover of the same name that followed.

Silvestri executive produced the anime adaptation of &quot;Witchblade&quot;.

He continued his work on &quot;X-Men&quot;, penciling the first installment, in the form of the Uncanny X-Men/Dark Avengers one-shot crossover &quot;Utopia&quot; in 2009. That same year, he contributed to the crossover miniseries &quot;Image United&quot;, penciling all the characters he created during his run at Image that featured in the story.

In 2012, Silvestri was one of several artists to illustrate a variant cover for Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; #100, which was released July 11 at San Diego Comic-Con.

In November 2022, DC Comics published the limited series &quot;Batman &amp; The Joker: The Deadly Duo&quot;, written and drawn by Silvestri.

<doc id="619562" wikidata="Q85759274" url="?curid=619562" title="Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands">
<text>Located about 2,300 miles (3,680 km) from the nearest continental shore, the Hawaiian Islands are the most isolated group of islands on the planet. The plant and animal life of the Hawaiian archipelago is the result of early, very infrequent colonizations of arriving species and the slow evolution of those species—in isolation from the rest of the world&#x27;s flora and fauna—over a period of at least 5 million years. As a consequence, Hawai&#x27;i is home to a large number of endemic species. The radiation of species described by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands which was critical to the formulation of his theory of evolution is far exceeded in the more isolated Hawaiian Islands.

The relatively short time that the existing main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean (less than 10 million years) is only a fraction of time span over which biological colonization and evolution have occurred in the archipelago. High, volcanic islands have existed in the Pacific far longer, extending in a chain to the northwest; these once mountainous islands are now reduced to submerged banks and coral atolls. Midway Atoll, for example, formed as a volcanic island some 28 million years ago. Kure Atoll, a little further to the northwest, is near the Darwin point—defined as waters of a temperature that allows coral reef development to &quot;just&quot; keep up with isostatic sinking. And extending back in time before Kure, an even older chain of islands spreads northward nearly to the Aleutian Islands; these former islands, all north of the Darwin point, are now completely submerged as the Emperor Seamounts.

The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. On a single island, the climate can differ around the coast from dry tropical (&lt; 20 in or 500 mm annual rainfall) to wet tropical; and up the slopes from tropical rainforest (&gt; 200 in or 5,000 mm per year) through a temperate climate into alpine conditions of cold and dry climate. The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, which affects the distribution of streams, wetlands, and wet places.

The distance and remoteness of the Hawaiian archipelago is a biological filter. Seeds or spores attached to a lost migrating bird&#x27;s feather or an insect falling out of the high winds found a place to survive in the islands and whatever else was needed to reproduce. The narrowing of the gene pool meant that at the very beginning, the population of a colonizing species was a bit different from that of the remote contributing population.
This list does not include species extinct in prehistoric times.

== Island formation ==
Throughout time, the Hawaiian Islands formed linearly from northwest to the southeast. A study was conducted to determine the approximate ages of the Hawaiian Islands using K–Ar dating of the oldest found igneous rocks from each island. Kauai was determined to be about 5.1 million years old, Oahu about 3.7 million years old and the youngest island of Hawaii about 0.43 million years old. By determining the maximum age of the islands, inferences could be made about the maximum possible age of organisms inhabiting the island. The newly formed islands were able to accommodate growing populations, while the new environments were causing high rates of new adaptations.

== Human arrival ==
Human contact, first by Polynesians and later by Europeans, has had a significant impact. Both the Polynesians and Europeans cleared native forests and introduced non-indigenous species for agriculture (or by accident), driving many endemic species to extinction. Fossil finds in caves, lava tubes, and sand dunes have revealed an avifauna that once had a native eagle, two raven-size crows, several bird-eating owls, and giant ducks known as moa-nalos. Around 861 species of plants have been introduced to the islands by humans since its discovery by Polynesian settlers, including crops such as taro and breadfruit.

Today, many of the remaining endemic species of plants and animals in the Hawaiian Islands are considered endangered, and some critically so. Plant species are particularly at risk: out of a total of 2,690 plant species, 946 are non-indigenous with 800 of the native species listed as endangered.

<text>The Audi 100 and Audi 200 (and sometimes called Audi 5000 in North America) are primarily mid-size/executive cars manufactured and marketed by the Audi division of the Volkswagen Group. The car was made from 1968 to 1997 across four generations (C1–C4), with a two-door model available in the first and second generation (C1-C2), and a five-door model available in the last three generations (C2–C4).

In 1982, the third generation Audi 100 achieved a remarkably low (for its time) drag coefficient of 0.30, featuring flush greenhouse sides with unique sliding window mountings.

The C2 and C3 models of the Audi 100 were marketed in North America as the Audi 5000 from 1978 to 1988, and in South Africa as the Audi 500.

In 1993, the models were mildly restyled, and renamed the Audi A6 series in conjunction with a general new Audi naming scheme, until they were replaced by a new generation of A6, internally code-named C5, in 1997. The Audi 100&#x27;s traditional competitors include the Mercedes Benz E-Class and BMW 5-Series.


==Type numbers==
In addition to the C platform codes, Audi assigned type numbers to their models:
* F104: C1; Audi 100 (1968–1976)
* Type 43: C2; Audi 100 (1976–1982); Audi 200 (1979–1982)
* Type 44: C3; Audi 100 (1983–1991); Audi 200 (1983–1992)
* Type 4A: C4; Audi 100 (1990–1994); Audi S4 (1992–1994); Audi A6 (1994–1997); Audi S6 (1994–1997)

==Audi 100 (C1, 1968–1976)==
The first Audi 100, developed by Auto Union (Volkswagen&#x27;s subsidiary) in Ingolstadt, was unveiled as a four-door sedan on November 26, 1968. Its name originally denoting a power output of , the Audi 100 was the company&#x27;s largest car since the revival of the Audi brand by Volkswagen in 1965. The C1 platform spawned several variants: the Audi 100 two- and four-door saloons, and the Audi 100 Coupé S, a fastback coupé, which bore a resemblance to the Aston Martin DBS released a year earlier with similar details such as the louvres behind the rear side windows and the shape of the rear light clusters.

Audi followed the introduction of the four-door saloon in November 1968 with a two-door saloon in October 1969 and the 100 Coupé S in autumn 1970. The cars&#x27; 1.8 litre four cylinder engines originally came in base 100 (), 100 S (), and 100 LS () versions, while the coupé was powered by a bored-out 1.9 litre developing . From April 1970 the 100 LS could be ordered with a three-speed automatic transmission sourced from Volkswagen.

Although the Audi 100&#x27;s engines were considered &#x27;rough&#x27;, critics stated that buyers whose first car had been a Beetle and aspired to upgrade to a contemporary diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz were unlikely to be discouraged. The Ingolstadt production line was at full capacity, yet fell short of demand during the summer of 1970 and an additional line was set up in Volkswagen&#x27;s own Wolfsburg plant, which made it the first water cooled car produced there. For the Swiss market, the 100 LS was equipped with a version of the 1.8 liter engine bored out by , producing . This placed the engine above the 9 horsepower tax threshold in the 19 cantons where this system was in use; why this was desired is unknown.

Starting with the 1972 model year, the 80 and 90 PS versions were replaced by a new regular petrol variant of the 1.8 liter engine developing ; at the same time, the 100 GL was introduced featuring the 1.9–liter engine formerly used only in the Coupé S.

In March 1971, the 500,000th Audi was produced. By now the Audi 100 had become the most commercially successful model in the company&#x27;s history. In 1976 the two millionth Audi was built, of which the 100 represented 800,000 cars.

In September 1973 (for the 1974 model year) the 100 received a facelift with a somewhat smaller squared-off grille, correspondingly more angular front fenders, and changed taillight lens patterns. The rear torsion beam suspension was replaced by coil springs. For the model year 1975, the base 100 was renamed the 100 L and received a 1.6 liter four cylinder engine (coming out of the Audi 80). A four-wheel drive prototype of the Audi 100 C1 was built in 1976, long before the appearance of quattro.

In South Africa, where the 100 was also assembled, the 100 was available as the L, LS, GL, and S Coupé. Local production began towards the end of 1972; by October 1976 33,000 units had been built in South Africa. The GL received a vinyl roof and &quot;GL&quot; lettering on the C-pillar. The LS was dropped for 1976, but returned for 1977 along with the new GLS saloon. The Coupé was discontinued. The LS and GLS were special versions of the L and GL, with silver paintjobs, automatic transmissions, and special red interiors. L and LS have a 1760 cc engine with DIN, while the GL and GLS have the larger 1871 cc engine producing .

In the United States the Audi 100 appeared in 1970 in LS guise, becoming the first Audi model sold there. With a SAE 1.8 liter engine and with either two or four doors. For 1972 the engine was enlarged to 1.9 liters, but the SAE net claimed power was down to . A base and a GL model were added, as was an automatic transmission. For 1974 the lineup was again restricted to the 100 LS, while the larger safety bumpers were now fitted. Power increased to for 1975, by changing to fuel injection. Standard equipment was improved accompanied by an increase in prices. In August 1977 the new Audi 5000 replaced the 100, although 537 leftover cars were sold in 1978. The coupé was not available in the United States.

==Audi 100, 200 and 5000 (C2, 1976–1982)==
The restyled C2 Audi 100 was launched in 1976, with an inline five-cylinder engine. It was initially a engine offering &quot;six-cylinder power and four-cylinder economy&quot;, later supplemented by less powerful versions.

The Coupé was discontinued, but a five-door hatchback model, the 100 Avant, was launched in August 1977 as part of this generation. These Avant new models bore a liftback design similar to Volkswagen Passats from the era.The mainstay of the range remained the four-door sedan model. A two-door sedan version was offered, primarily on the domestic market, from February 1977, but by now there was little demand for large two-door sedans and thus only a few of these two-door Audi 100 C2s were sold. At the top of the line, the Audi 200 made its appearance at the 1979 Frankfurt Show, with fuel injected five cylinder engines in either naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms.

At the end of September 1977, the Audi 100 became the manufacturer&#x27;s first model to reach a production level of 1,000,000 units. The millionth Audi 100 was a hatchback Audi 100 Avant assembled not at the company&#x27;s main Ingolstadt plant but to the west, at the Neckarsulm factory which, since the demise of the mainstream volume models from the NSU range, had been concentrating on providing additional production capacity for the fast selling Audi range. The 100 C2 effectively became a de facto successor to the similarly sized NSU Ro80 which ceased production in 1977, and the NSU name gradually disappeared from the public consciousness - eventually being erased from the company name completely in 1985 when Audi NSU Auto Union AG renamed itself Audi AG.

Engines available outside of North America included:
* 1.6 L I4, , carbureted (1976−1982)
* 2.0 L I4, , carbureted (1976−1978)
* 1.9 L I5, , carbureted (1980−1982)
* 2.1 L I5, , carbureted (1978−1982)
* 2.1 L I5, , fuel injection (1976−1982) (100 and 200)
* 2.1 L I5, , fuel injection, turbo (1979−1982) (200 only)
* 2.0 L I5 Diesel, , (1978−1982)

About 850,000 Audi 100/200 C2s were built, of which 133,512 were sold in the United States.

The RHD Audi 200 5E and 5T were introduced into the UK in 1979, only 500 were imported. The 5T (170 PS) was a higher spec Turbo version of the 5E (136 PS injection) and came with many optional extras as standard. The UK version of the 5T had opening quarter lights, electric door mirrors, a sunroof, cruise control and heated seats. All Type 43 200&#x27;s came with automatic gearboxes, with a five-speed manual available by special order.

The C2 was sold as the Audi 5E in Australia. It was part of a very restricted Audi lineup, being the only model on offer for several years. The only engine on offer was the carburetted 2144-cc inline-five with , coupled to a four-speed manual in the GL and to a three-speed automatic in the CD.

===Audi 5000 (1978-1983)===
In North America, where sales of the Audi 5000 C2s reached 133,512, only five-cylinder engines were available. The 5000 had twin round headlamps for the first two model years, after which they were replaced by rectangular units. The diesel was originally not available in California, as Porsche-Audi of North America was unable to meet that state&#x27;s strict emissions standards. The naturally aspirated diesel was also only available with a five-speed manual, a handicap in the American market. It was not until the 1983 introduction of the turbo diesel that these concerns were met. The 50-state Turbo diesel arrived for the 1983 model year, at about the same time that the Audi 100 C3 was presented in Europe, and was only ever sold in the United States.

In 1980 the 5000 Turbo arrived in the US. This model only delivered , more than twenty percent less than the European spec model. Aside from meeting the strict US emissions, this model also had lower boost pressure to be able to run on the lower octane unleaded fuel available in America. While the Turbo also received a harder, sportier suspension, bigger aluminium wheels, and other performance upgrades, it was also only available with a three-speed automatic transmission. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; were able to reach a top speed of in the federalized car, slower than a naturally aspirated European market 2.1 E. In the US, reflecting the Audi&#x27;s luxury connotations, 90 percent of 5000s were delivered with the costlier &quot;S&quot; equipment package.

The 5000 Turbo diesel received an increase in power and torque, offset somewhat by only being available in conjunction with Audi&#x27;s &quot;3+E&quot; automatic transmission. This was a three-speed automatic in which the &quot;E&quot; mode engaged a freewheel effect, lowering fuel consumption by 3-5 percent. The Turbo diesel received the same body and interior specifications as the gasoline-powered turbo; the only difference was the use of 14-inch alloy wheels rather than the wider 15-inch items mounted on the 5000 Turbo.

North America:
* 2.1 L I5, , fuel injection (MY 1978−1983). from 1980 on.
* 2.1 L I5, , fuel injection, turbo (MY 1980−1983)
* 2.0 L I5 diesel, (MY 1980−1982)
* 2.0 L I5 turbo diesel, (MY 1983)

==Audi 100, 200 and 5000 (C3, 1982–1991)==
The third generation Audi 100 launched in September 1982 with aerodynamic styling, contrasting the boxy styling of its predecessor, and offering a much improved drag coefficient, 0.30 on base model. The aerodynamic C3 bodywork featured pin-mounted flush windows, offering a key reduction in aerodynamic drag. Altogether, the aerodynamic body increased the fuel efficiency and top speed versus other cars of similar engine size. The C3 introduced Audi&#x27;s proprietary restraint system, marketed as procon-ten.

Two-door models were no longer offered, and the Audi 100 Avant was now positioned as a station wagon rather than a hatchback - the &quot;Avant&quot; designation would be used for all Audi station wagons from that point forward. The Avant featured an available extra folding third row seat — not available in conjunction with ABS-brakes as the brake control unit sat in the same space. The 200, launched in 1983 continued as the upmarket variant with several versions of the 2.2 L turbo 5-cylinder available in different markets over its life ranging in power outputs from MC engine, through the versions to the final 20-valve 3B engine available from 1991. The 1983 Audi 200 Turbo had a top speed of . The MC turbo engine was available in the 100 as well for some markets.

In January 1988 the Audi 100 received a minor facelift, including flush fitting door handles. The 1991 200 20V featured flared (vs. flat) front and rounded rear wheel arches to accommodate wider wheel and tire combinations to be fitted to 20V models. U.S. magazine articles of the period reported 0-60 times of the 20-valve Audi 200 under 7 seconds, with 1/4 mile times in the mid to upper 15 second mark.

The Audi 100 also featured a 2.5 L straight-five direct injection turbo-diesel (TDI) model with introduced in January 1990 (engine code 1T). This was the first model to wear the TDI label. It had a brief career in the C3, being replaced in December of that year when the C4 arrived.

The Audi V8 used an enlarged version of the bodyshell from the Audi 100/200 C3 but received more luxury features and a V8 engine.

===Reported sudden unintended acceleration===
During model years 1983–1987, Audi&#x27;s U.S. sales fell after several recalls of Audi 5000 models, which were associated with reported incidents of sudden unintended acceleration linked to six deaths and 700 accidents. At the time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.

In North America, the CBS television broadcast network &quot;60 Minutes&quot; news program aired a report titled &quot;Out of Control&quot; on November 23, 1986. It featured interviews with six people who had sued Audi after reporting unintended acceleration, including footage of an Audi 5000 ostensibly displaying a surge of acceleration while the brake pedal was depressed. Subsequent investigation revealed that &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had not disclosed they had engineered the vehicle&#x27;s behaviorfitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, to pump fluid via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmissionthe arrangement executed by one of the experts who had testified on behalf of a plaintiff in a then-pending lawsuit against Audi&#x27;s parent company.

Audi initially responded by suggesting that the drivers of the cars involved in the incidents were at fault, because they had depressed the accelerator pedal rather than the brake. Subsequently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report, were caused mainly by factors such as confusion of pedals. CBS acknowledged the report and stressed its findings that &quot;the problem could be aggravated by vehicle design, the shape, location and feel of gas and brake pedals.&quot; Audi&#x27;s research demonstrated that many of the drivers who encountered &quot;unintended acceleration&quot; were &quot;below average in height&quot;, indicating their knowledge of a relationship between design and the incidents.

In a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended acceleration problems: &quot;Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident.&quot;

This summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA&#x27;s most technical analysis at the time: &quot;Audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car]. These accelerations could not be the sole cause of [(long-duration) sudden acceleration incidents (SAI)], but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the driver. The defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of electronic throttle control. Significantly: multiple &quot;intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded ... and [were also observed and] reported by Transport Canada.&quot;

With the series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models. Later repairs of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978 added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park. It is unclear what was done regarding the defects in the idle-stabilization system. Subsequent to the recall campaigns, vehicles now include gear shift patterns and brake interlock mechanisms to prevent deliberate gear selection.

Audi&#x27;s U.S. sales, which had reached 74,061 in 1985, dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years, with resale values falling dramatically. Audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection and renamed the affected modelswith the &quot;5000&quot; becoming the &quot;100&quot; and &quot;200&quot; in 1989. The company only reached the same level of U.S. sales again by model year 2000.

As of early 2010, a class-action lawsuitdealing with a charge that on account of the sudden acceleration controversy, Audi models had lost resale valuefiled in 1987 by about 7,500 Audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and is currently contested in county court in Chicago after appeals at the Illinois state and U.S. federal levels. The NHTSA&#x27;s findings have been &quot;small solace for Audi in defense of product liability actions, as more and more successful cases used Audi&#x27;s human factor design errors and failure to warn or recall as a basis for liability.&quot;

=== Motorsport ===
In 1988, Audi entered the Trans-Am Series with the 200 turbo quattro by contracting Bob Tullius Group 44 Racing. The car was equipped with the Quattro system. The car was piloted by Hurley Haywood and with both Walter Röhrl and Hans-Joachim Stuck won eight out of thirteen events. Audi moved to IMSA by the end of the season, the SCCA would change the regulation to a two-wheel drive only and banning cars with non-American engines. The Historic Trans-am &amp; IMSA Group is dedicated to the preservation of the cars that ran in the SCCA Trans-am series and the similar IMSA GTO class from 1980 until 1991.

Audi also used the 200 Turbo Quattro 20v as their Group A rally car replacement for the aging Audi Quattro after the FIA elimination of Group B in 1986. The 1987 Group A 200 was driven by former World Rally Champions drivers Hannu Mikkola and Walter Röhrl. The Audi 200 became the first four-wheel-drive car to win the Safari Rally, with Hannu Mikkola driving, with it being the last win for Audi in the world rally championship. The 200 Quattro became the last car Audi campaigned in rallying as a manufacturing team.

==Audi 100 (C4, 1990–1994)==


Audi released the C4 in late 1990 in Continental Europe and during 1991 in other markets, including the right-hand drive British market. It was a rebodied and updated C3, keeping the chassis, suspension, and most powertrains. The most significant menchanical changes were the new V6 engines and a wider track, increased by front and rear. The C3-platform Audi V8 continued to be sold as a separate line. The major change for the C4 was the introduction of a 2.8 L, 90-degree, SOHC 12v, V6 engine. It was later joined by a 2.6 L variant, of the same configuration as the 2.8 L unit. They are essentially the same engines offered in the 1992, B4 Audi 80. The option of quattro permanent four-wheel drive was an option across the range, except the smallest engines. The Audi 100 quattro was available with a ZF four-speed automatic and a 5 speed manual gearbox.

This generation was also available with the 2.5 litre, 5-cylinder TDI engine, introduced late in the C3 production, which provided outstanding performance, economy and refinement.

During 1994, in conjunction with some styling revisions, Audi dropped the Audi 100 tag, renaming it the A6 instead. In addition, the existing 100-derived Audi S4 became the S6. The S4 name was later reused for the high-performance derivative of the Audi A4 (replacement for the Audi 80). The Audi V8 had been replaced by the A8 in 1994.

The C4-based A6 continued until early 1998, when it was replaced by an all-new A6.

==Production in the Chinese market (1988–2005)==
The C3-platform Audi 100 was also produced in Changchun, China, by FAW (First Automotive Works, a Chinese automotive manufacturer) starting in August 1988. Since most products in China are designed for government use, all 100s manufactured as FAWs were front-wheel drive sedans with a 2.0 L inline-four motor or a 2.2 L inline-five motor.

In 1990, Politburo of the CCP approved a resolution to circumscribe car import and the engine displacement of cars equipped to officials. Furthermore, the resolution also prescribed that all cars of central departments of both Party and government must be domestically built. As the most luxurious and advanced cars made in China in early-1990s, FAW-Audi 100 and 200 had a high percentage of the Chinese high-class market of executive cars for nearly a decade, until the C3-platform cars was replaced by C4 based Audi A6 in 1999.

During the negotiation between FAW and Volkswagen in late-1980s, Volkswagen acceded to FAW&#x27;s suggestion of combining the C3 platform with previously introduced Chrysler engines in the new generation Hongqi (Red Flag). Hongqi CA7200 series with the technology of C3 were launched in mid-1990s, while most of C3 Audi 100 parts could be made in China. CA7200 were initially equipped with a 2.0 L or 2.2 L Chrysler four-cylinder engine, whose product line was introduced into China in 1987 - originally being intended for a version of the Dodge 600 to be produced there under the Hongqi brand. In 2005, new Nissan VQ20 engines replaced the original Chrysler unit.

A small number of C3 200s (originally with 2.6-liter V6 engine, later also with a turbocharged 1.8) were also built. The 200 entered production in 1996. The 1.8 litre Hongqi engine was known as the &quot;QG18&quot; while the 1.8 turbo was Volkswagen&#x27;s EA827 engine. The early C4 Audi 100 was also assembled in Changchun in small numbers. The C4 was largely built in the European style body with European style headlights but had American style tail lights.

Hongqi production commenced in 1989 with the CA7225LH, a limousine based on the Audi 100 and was intended to replace the outdated Hongqi CA770. The CA7225LH debuted on October 1, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. None other than then-president Jiang Zemin and then-premier Li Peng sat in the car during a special exhibition in Beijing. It was extended 680 millimeters behind the C-pillar, creating a three-row car. In 1993, the car was facelifted and renamed the CA7221L, while in 1996 a police variant named the CA5020XJB started being built. In 1996, the first Hongqi-badged Audi 100 sedan was produced, and named the Hongqi CA7220. From that point on, the limousines would be based on the Hongqi sedan, and not directly the original Audi. As such, Hongqi&#x27;s new facelifted limousine was the CA7228L in 1996. Soon, this model was further restyled and renamed the CA7226L and then the CA7220EL1. Initially, all these limousines were mostly available for the government and institutions, but during the later 1990s, many were also sold to private buyers. In 1997, the CA7220L1 was produced. This time it was not based on the Audi 100, but on the Audi V8 LWB. Only a dozen of these cars were built. The previous Audi 100 based limousine would now be facelifted and renamed the CA7240L, and then the CA7200E3L and CA7247L. In 2000, the car was heavily facelifted and modernized, but also renamed the CA7202E3L Century Star. In 2001, the CA7180A2EL1 Mingshi/Shiba was released. The limousine was based on the previous model, which came in two variants; the base Mingshi and the luxury Shiba. The model was then renamed the CA7202E3L1 Century Star, CA7242E6L1 Century Star, and CA7242E6L Century Star, in a series of restylings and upgrades. Production continued until 2005, when the car was replaced by the new Hongqi HQE. 

The first Hongqi-badged Audi 100 sedan was produced in 1996, and was named the Hongqi CA7220. Through some restylings and upgrades, and by 2000 it was renamed to the Hongqi Mingshi CA7180A4E, it was built until 2005, where the Toyota Crown Majesta S180 replaced the Audi 100-based Hongqis as the successor under the name HQ3 and HQ430. Based on the sedan, a number of other variants such as station wagons and coupé utilities were also built, but in relatively small numbers. The Hongqi-badged Audi 100 sedans were the first mid-size 4-door sedans produced by FAW in any significant numbers since the Dongfeng CA71 of the 1960s.

In some variants the 2-litre Nissan VG20E V6 was also available as it had proved its use with Nissan&#x27;s own large cars, being used in the Gloria and Cedric Y30.

All Chinese spec Audi 100s, 200s and Hongqi vehicles were front wheel drive and had a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard.


==Audi Duo==
At the Geneva Motor Show in March 1990 Audi presented its first of the Audi Duo (or Audi 100 Avant Duo) experimental vehicle, a plug-in parallel hybrid based on the Audi 100 Avant quattro. This car had a Siemens electric motor which drove the rear wheels. A trunk-mounted nickel-cadmium battery supplied energy to the motor that drove the rear wheels. The vehicle&#x27;s front wheels were powered by a 2.3-litre five-cylinder engine with an output of . The intent was to produce a vehicle which could operate on the engine in the country and electric mode in the city. Mode of operation could be selected by the driver. Ten vehicles are believed to have been made; one drawback was the extra weight of the electric drive, making vehicles less efficient when running on their engines alone than standard Audi 100s with the same engine.

In late 1991, Audi unveiled the second Duo generation – likewise based on the Audi 100 Avant quattro. Once again this featured an electric motor, a three-phase machine, driving the rear wheels. This time, however, the rear wheels were additionally powered via the Torsen differential from the main engine compartment, which housed a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine.

In 2014 animated series &quot;All Hail King Julien&quot;, the titular protagonist references the car during an escape attempt, proclaiming, &quot;We are so out of here: outie 5000!&quot;

<text>The International Standard Wine Number or ISWN, similar to the ISBN for books, was a coding scheme intended to give a unique identifier for each wine worldwide. The ISWN system had a consistent unique code for each wine producer (ISWN-P), each wine brand or product (ISWN-W), each vintage variant of a wine product (ISWN-V), and the bottle variants (ISWN-B). The ISWN was allocated by the ISWN Organization on the basis of a global reference database of wine producers and wines worldwide. The database was improved through wine producers updating their own data with the ISWN Manager module. The ISWN Organization was a Non-profit organization sponsored by the wine industry.

<doc id="619578" wikidata="Q360366" url="?curid=619578" title="Nicomachus">
<text>Nicomachus of Gerasa (; ) was an Ancient Greek Neopythagorean philosopher from Gerasa, in the Roman province of Syria (now Jerash, Jordan). Like many Pythagoreans, Nicomachus wrote about the mystical properties of numbers, best known for his works &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; and &quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot;, which are an important resource on Ancient Greek mathematics and Ancient Greek music in the Roman period. Nicomachus&#x27; work on arithmetic became a standard text for Neoplatonic education in Late antiquity, with philosophers such as Iamblichus and John Philoponus writing commentaries on it. A Latin paraphrase by Boethius of Nicomachus&#x27;s works on arithmetic and music became standard textbooks in medieval education.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Nicomachus except that he was a Pythagorean who came from Gerasa. His &quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot; was addressed to a lady of noble birth, at whose request Nicomachus wrote the book, which suggests that he was a respected scholar of some status. He mentions his intent to write a more advanced work, and how the journeys he frequently undertakes leave him short of time.The approximate dates in which he lived () can only be estimated based on which other authors he refers to in his work, as well as which later mathematicians who refer to him. He mentions Thrasyllus in his &quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot;, and his &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; was apparently translated into Latin in the mid 2nd century by Apuleius,while he makes no mention at all of either Theon of Smyrna&#x27;s work on arithmetic or Ptolemy&#x27;s work on music, implying that they were either later contemporaries or lived in the time after he did.

==Philosophy==
Historians consider Nicomachus a Neopythagorean based on his tendency to view numbers as having mystical properties rather than their mathematical properties, citing an extensive amount of Pythagorean literature in his work, including works by Philolaus, Archytas, and Androcydes. He writes extensively on numbers, especially on the significance of prime numbers and perfect numbers and argues that arithmetic is ontologically prior to the other mathematical sciences (music, geometry, and astronomy), and is their cause. Nicomachus distinguishes between the wholly conceptual immaterial number, which he regards as the &#x27;divine number&#x27;, and the numbers which measure material things, the &#x27;scientific&#x27; number. Nicomachus provided one of the earliest Greco-Roman multiplication tables; the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the British Museum).

===Metaphysics===
Although Nicomachus is considered a Pythagorean, John M. Dillon says that Nicomachus&#x27;s philosophy &quot;fits comfortably within the spectrum of contemporary Platonism.&quot; In his work on arithmetic, Nicomachus quotes from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; to make a distinction between the intelligible world of Forms and the sensible world, however, he also makes more Pythagorean distinctions, such as between Odd and even numbers. Unlike many other Neopythagoreans, such as Moderatus of Gades, Nicomachus makes no attempt to distinguish between the Demiurge, who acts on the material world, and The One which serves as the supreme first principle. For Nicomachus, God as the supreme first principle is both the demiurge and the Intellect (nous), which Nicomachus also equates to being the monad, the potentiality from which all actualities are created. 

==Works==
Two of Nicomachus&#x27; works, the &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; and the &quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot; are extant in a complete form, and two others, a work on &quot;Theology of Arithmetic&quot; and a &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot; survive in fragments, epitomes, and summaries by later authors. The &quot;Theology of Arithmetic&quot; (), on the Pythagorean mystical properties of numbers in two books is mentioned by Photius. There is an extant work sometimes attributed to Iamblichus under this title written two centuries later which contains a great deal of material thought to have been copied or paraphrased from Nicomachus&#x27; work. Nicomachus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pythagoras&quot; was one of the main sources used by Porphyry and Iamblichus, for their (extant) &quot;Lives&quot; of Pythagoras. An &quot;Introduction to Geometry&quot;, referred to by Nicomachus himself in the &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic,&quot; has not survived. Among his known lost work is another larger work on music, promised by Nicomachus himself, and apparently referred to by Eutocius in his comment on the sphere and cylinder of Archimedes.
===&quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot;===
&quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; (, ) is the only extant work on mathematics by Nicomachus. The work contains both philosophical prose and basic mathematical ideas. Nicomachus refers to Plato quite often, and writes that philosophy can only be possible if one knows enough about mathematics. Nicomachus also describes how natural numbers and basic mathematical ideas are eternal and unchanging, and in an abstract realm. The work consists of two books, twenty-three and twenty-nine chapters, respectively.

Nicomachus&#x27;s presentation is much less rigorous than Euclid centuries earlier. Propositions are typically stated and illustrated with one example, but not proven through inference. In some instances this results in patently false assertions. For example, he states that from it can be concluded that , only because this is true for a=6, b=5 and c=3.

Boethius&#x27; &quot;De institutione arithmetica&quot; is in large part a Latin translation of this work.

===&quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot;===
&quot;Manuale Harmonicum&quot; (Ἐγχειρίδιον ἁρμονικῆς, &quot;Encheiridion Harmonikes&quot;) is the first important music theory treatise since the time of Aristoxenus and Euclid. It provides the earliest surviving record of the legend of Pythagoras&#x27;s epiphany outside of a smithy that pitch is determined by numeric ratios. Nicomachus also gives the first in-depth account of the relationship between music and the ordering of the universe via the &quot;music of the spheres.&quot; Nicomachus&#x27;s discussion of the governance of the ear and voice in understanding music unites Aristoxenian and Pythagorean concerns, normally regarded as antitheses. In the midst of theoretical discussions, Nicomachus also describes the instruments of his time, also providing a valuable resource. In addition to the &quot;Manual&quot;, ten extracts survive from what appear to have originally been a more substantial work on music.

==Legacy==

===Late antiquity===

The &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; of Nicomachus was a standard textbook in Neoplatonic schools, and commentaries on it were written by Iamblichus (3rd century) and John Philoponus (6th century). 

The &quot;Arithmetic&quot; (in Latin: &quot;De Institutione Arithmetica&quot;) of Boethius was a Latin paraphrase and a partial translation of the &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot;. The &quot;Manual of Harmonics&quot; also became the basis of the Boethius&#x27; Latin treatise titled &quot;De institutione musica&quot;. 

===Medieval European philosophy===

The work of Boethius on arithmetic and music was a core part of the &quot;Quadrivium&quot; liberal arts and had a great diffusion during the Middle Ages.

===Nicomachus&#x27;s theorem===

At the end of Chapter 20 of his &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot;, Nicomachus points out that if one writes a list of the odd numbers, the first is the cube of 1, the sum of the next two is the cube of 2, the sum of the next three is the cube of 3, and so on. He does not go further than this, but from this it follows that the sum of the first cubes equals the sum of the first formula_1 odd numbers, that is, the odd numbers from 1 to formula_2. The average of these numbers is obviously formula_1, and there are formula_1 of them, so their sum is formula_5 Many early mathematicians have studied and provided proofs of Nicomachus&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Josep Comas i Solà (; Barcelona 17 December 1868 – 2 December 1937) was a Catalan astronomer, discoverer of minor planets, comets, and double stars.

He wrote his first astronomy notes at the age of ten, and was only fifteen when he published an article in a French specialist magazine.

He observed planets including Mars and Saturn, measuring the rotation period of the latter. He wrote some books popularizing astronomy, and was first president of the Spanish and American Astronomical Society (; S.A.D.E.Y.A.). He discovered the periodic comet 32P/Comas Solà, and co-discovered the non-periodic comet C/1925 F1 (Shajn-Comas Solà); he is also credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 11 asteroids during 1915–1930. Comas i Solà is also credited with the discovery of the double star SOL 1.

In 1905, Solà received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society. In 1908 he claimed to observe limb darkening of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, the first evidence that the body had an atmosphere. He was the head of Fabra Observatory since it was established in 1904.

The asteroids 1102 Pepita (from his nickname &quot;Pepito&quot;) and 1655 Comas Solà are named after him, as is Comas Sola crater on Mars.

<text>A sememe (; ) is a semantic language unit of meaning, analogous to a morpheme. The concept is relevant in structural semiotics.

A seme is a proposed unit of transmitted or intended meaning; it is atomic or indivisible. A sememe can be the meaning expressed by a morpheme, such as the English pluralizing morpheme &quot;-s&quot;, which carries the sememic feature [+ plural]. Alternatively, a single sememe (for example [go] or [move]) can be conceived as the abstract representation of such verbs as &quot;skate&quot;, &quot;roll&quot;, &quot;jump&quot;, &quot;slide&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, or &quot;boogie&quot;. It can be thought of as the semantic counterpart to any of the following: a meme in a culture, a gene in a genome, or an atom (or, more generally, an elementary particle) in a substance. A seme is the name for the smallest unit of meaning recognized in semantics, referring to a single characteristic of a sememe.

There are five types of sememes: two denotational and three connotational, the latter occurring only in phrase units (they do not reflect the denotation):
# Denotational 1: Primary denotation, for example &quot;head&quot; (body);
# Denotational 2: Secondary denotation by resemblance with other denotation: &quot;head&quot; (ship);
# Connotational 1: Analogous in function or nature as the original denotation, for example, &quot;head&quot; used as managing or leading positions, which is similar to the role or function of &quot;head&quot; in the operation of the human body;
# Connotational 2: Emotive, e.g. meaning in &quot;honey&quot;;
# Connotational 3: Evaluative, e.g. meaning in &quot;sneak&quot; – move silently and secretly for a bad purpose

The operational definition of synonymy depends on the distinctions between these classes of sememes. For example, the differentiation between what some academics call cognitive synonyms and near-synonyms depends on these differences.

A related concept is that of the &quot;episememe&quot; (as described in the works of Leonard Bloomfield), which is a unit of meaning corresponding to the tagmeme.

<doc id="619594" wikidata="Q147101" url="?curid=619594" title="Aciclovir">
<text>Aciclovir, also known as acyclovir, is an antiviral medication. It is primarily used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections, chickenpox, and shingles. Other uses include, prevention of cytomegalovirus infections following transplant, and severe complications of Epstein–Barr virus infection. It can be taken by mouth, applied as a cream, or injected.
Common side effects include nausea and diarrhea. Potentially serious side effects include kidney problems and low platelets. Greater care is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function. It is generally considered safe for use in pregnancy with no harm having been observed. It appears to be safe during breastfeeding. Aciclovir is a nucleoside analogue that mimics guanosine. It works by decreasing the production of the virus&#x27;s DNA.
Aciclovir was patented in 1974, by Burroughs Wellcome, and approved for medical use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 134th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4million prescriptions.

==Medical use==

Aciclovir acts by inhibiting viral DNA replication and is used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus infections, including:
* Genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention)
* Neonatal herpes simplex
* Herpes simplex labialis (cold sores)
* Shingles
* Acute chickenpox in immunocompromised patients
* Herpes simplex encephalitis
* Acute mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients
* Herpes of the eye and herpes simplex blepharitis (a chronic (long-term) form of herpes eye infection)
* Prevention of herpes viruses in immunocompromised people (such as people undergoing cancer chemotherapy)

It has not been found to be effective against Epstein–Barr virus and its associated infectious mononucleosis. Aciclovir risks causing resistance to antiviral agents, and in 1% to 10% of cases can cause unpleasant side effects.

Aciclovir taken by mouth does not appear to decrease the risk of pain after shingles. In those with herpes of the eye, aciclovir may be more effective and safer than idoxuridine. It is unclear if aciclovir eye drops are more effective than brivudine eye drops.

Intravenous aciclovir is effective in treating severe medical conditions caused by different species of the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of the herpes virus, severe genital herpes, chickenpox and herpesviral encephalitis. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum, and herpesviral meningitis.
Reviews of research dating from the 1980s show there is some effect in reducing the number and duration of lesions if aciclovir is applied at an early stage of an outbreak. Research shows effectiveness of topical aciclovir in both the early and late stages of the outbreak as well as improving methodologically and in terms of statistical certainty from previous studies. Aciclovir trials show that this agent has no role in preventing HIV transmission, but it can help slow HIV disease progression in people not taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART). This finding emphasizes the importance of testing simple, inexpensive non-ART strategies, such as aciclovir and cotrimoxazole, in people with HIV.

===Pregnancy===
The CDC and others have declared that during severe recurrent or first episodes of genital herpes, aciclovir may be used. For severe HSV infections (especially disseminated HSV), IV aciclovir may also be used.

Studies in mice, rabbits, and rats (with doses more than 10 times the equivalent of that used in humans) given during organogenesis have failed to demonstrate birth defects. Studies in rats in which they were given the equivalent to 63 times the standard steady-state human concentrations of the drug on day 10 of gestation showed head and tail anomalies.

Aciclovir is recommended by the CDC for treatment of varicella during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.

Aciclovir is excreted in breast milk, therefore it is recommended that caution should be used in breast-feeding women. It has been shown in limited test studies that the nursing infant is exposed to approximately 0.3 mg/kg/day following oral administration of aciclovir to the mother. If nursing mothers have herpetic lesions near or on the breast, breast-feeding should be avoided.

== Adverse effects ==

===Systemic therapy===
Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (&lt;0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, anaphylaxis, and Cotard&#x27;s syndrome.

Intravenous aciclovir may cause reversible nephrotoxicity in up to 5% to 10% of patients because of precipitation of aciclovir crystals in the kidney. Aciclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when aciclovir is given as a rapid infusion and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk.

The aciclovir metabolite 9-Carboxymethoxymethylguanine (9-CMMG) has been shown to play a role in neurological adverse events, particularly in older people and those with reduced renal function.

===Topical therapy===
Aciclovir topical cream is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include erythema or itch. When applied to the eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), ophthalmic aciclovir is associated with superficial punctate keratitis or allergic reactions.

==Drug interactions==
Ketoconazole: In-vitro replication studies have found a synergistic, dose-dependent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 when given with aciclovir. However, this effect has not been clinically established and more studies need to be done to evaluate the true potential of this synergy.

Probenecid: Reports of increased half-life of aciclovir, as well as decreased urinary excretion and renal clearance have been shown in studies where probenecid is given simultaneously with aciclovir.

Interferon: Synergistic effects when administered with aciclovir and caution should be taken when administering aciclovir to patients receiving IV interferon.

Zidovudine: Although administered often with aciclovir in HIV patients, neurotoxicity has been reported in at least one patient who presented with extreme drowsiness and lethargy 30–60 days after receiving IV aciclovir; symptoms resolved when aciclovir was discontinued.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Aciclovir may be quantitated in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with renal dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.

==Mechanism of action==
Aciclovir is converted by viral thymidine kinase to aciclovir monophosphate, which is then converted by host cell kinases to aciclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP, also known as aciclo-GTP). ACV-TP is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. ACV-TP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination.

===Resistance===
Resistance to aciclovir is rare in people with healthy immune systems but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic antiviral prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV infection). Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase; and mutations to viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase, altering substrate sensitivity.

===Microbiology===

Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity:
* Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1)
* Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2)
* Varicella zoster virus
* Epstein–Barr virus
* Human cytomegalovirus – least activity

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Aciclovir is poorly water-soluble and has poor oral bioavailability (15–30%), hence intravenous administration is necessary if high concentrations are required. When orally administered, peak plasma concentration occurs after 1–2 hours. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, aciclovir is a Class III drug, i.e., soluble with low intestinal permeability. Aciclovir has a high distribution rate; protein binding is reported to range from 9 to 33%. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of aciclovir depends according to age group; neonates have a t1/2 of 4 hours, children 1–12 years have a t1/2 of 2–3 hours whereas adults have a t1/2 of 3 hours.

== Chemistry ==
Details of the synthesis of aciclovir were first published by scientists from the University at Buffalo.
In the first step shown, 2,6-dichloropurine was alkylated with 1-benzoyloxy-2-chloromethoxyethane. The chlorine group at the 6-position of the heterocyclic ring is more reactive than the chlorine at the 2-position, hence it can be selectively replaced by an amino group, which was then converted to an amide using nitrous acid. Finally, the remaining chlorine was replaced by the amino group of aciclovir using ammonia in methanol. This synthesis and other methods for preparing the compound have been reviewed.

==History==
Aciclovir was seen as the start of a new era in antiviral therapy, as it is extremely selective and low in cytotoxicity. Since the discovery in the mid-1970s, it has been used as an effective drug for the treatment of infections caused by most known species of the herpesvirus family, including herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses. Nucleosides isolated from a Caribbean sponge, &quot;Cryptotethya crypta&quot;, were the basis for the synthesis of aciclovir. It was codiscovered by Howard Schaeffer following his work with Robert Vince, S. Bittner and S. Gurwara on the adenosine analog acycloadenosine which showed promising antiviral activity. Later, Schaeffer joined Burroughs Wellcome and continued the development of aciclovir with pharmacologist Gertrude B. Elion. A U.S. patent on aciclovir listing Schaeffer as inventor was issued in 1979. Vince later invented abacavir, an nRTI drug for HIV patients. Elion was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine, partly for the development of aciclovir.

A related prodrug form, valaciclovir came into medical use in 1995. It is converted to aciclovir in the body after absorption.

In 2009, acyclovir in combination with hydrocortisone cream, marketed as Xerese, was approved in the United States for the early treatment of recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores) to reduce the likelihood of ulcerative cold sores and to shorten the lesion healing time in adults and children (six years of age and older).

==Society and culture==

===Names===
It was originally marketed as Zovirax; patents expired in the 1990s and since then it has been generic and is marketed under many brand names worldwide.

<doc id="619595" wikidata="Q4881037" url="?curid=619595" title="Jack (flag)">
<text>A jack is a flag flown from a short jackstaff at the bow (front) of a vessel, while the ensign is flown on the stern (rear). Jacks on bowsprits or foremasts appeared in the 17th century. A country may have different jacks for different purposes, especially when (as in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) the naval jack is forbidden to other vessels. The United Kingdom has an official civil jack; the Netherlands has several unofficial ones. In some countries, ships of other government institutions may fly the naval jack, e.g. the ships of the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the case of the US jack. Certain organs of the UK&#x27;s government have their own departmental jacks. Commercial or pleasure craft may fly the flag of an administrative division (state, province, land) or municipality at the bow. Merchant ships may fly a house flag. Yachts may fly a club burgee or officer&#x27;s flag or the owner&#x27;s private signal at the bow. Practice may be regulated by law, custom, or personal judgment.

==Etymology==
&quot;Jack&quot; occupies 6 pages of the complete second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary and the use of the word in English goes back to the 14th century, appearing as a forename in Piers Plowman. Quite early on it was used as a name for a peasant or &quot;a man of the lower orders&quot;. It continued the low class connotations in phrases such as &quot;jack tar&quot; for a common seaman, &quot;every man jack,&quot; or the use of jack for the knave in cards. The diminutive form is also seen in &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none&quot;, where Jack implies a poor tradesman, possibly not up to journeyman standard. The term was taken into inanimate objects and denoted a small (or occasionally inferior) component: jack-pit (a small mine shaft), jackplug (single pronged, low current), jack-shaft (intermediate or idler shaft), jack (in bowling: the small ball) or jack-engine (a donkey or barring engine). Incidentally, a jack is a garment for the upper body (quotes from 1375 onwards), a jacket is derived from this and is a small jack; not the other way around. As a further example of this usage, in 1686 Robert Plot writing about gins (i.e. horse engines) to pump water out of mines says: &quot;they draw it [the water] up by Gin, which is made bigger, or less ... the less they call a Jack&quot;.

As a flag, &quot;jack&quot; followed this usage. A jack flag was a small flag, used to distinguish it from the large ensign or pennants. The OED mentions the theory of its derivation from James I or from a leathern jacket but dismisses both: &quot;neither of these conjectures covers the early use of the word&quot;. Originally, the jack would have been flown from the bowsprit topmast head: &quot;You are alsoe for this present service to keepe in yor Jack at yor Boultspritt end&quot; (sailing instructions 1633 as quoted in OED2). In 1667 Samuel Pepys, naval administrator and diarist, recorded the Dutch taking the and a man &quot;struck her flag and jacke&quot; — clearly two different things. By 1692 the jackstaff had been developed to fly the jack: &quot;Jack staff and Jack&quot;.

==Usage==
A naval jack is usually flown when the ship is not under way, but is moored or at anchor, or when it is dressed overall on special occasions. The Union Jack of the Royal Navy must be run up when the first line is ashore when coming alongside. The same regulations are applied by the Royal Canadian Navy.

In the United States, the First Navy Jack is also used as embroidered sleeve patches by the US Navy on its uniforms.

== Shapes and designs ==
Naval jacks are usually rectangular, often square, and smaller than the national ensign or war flag. Some countries fly a smaller version of the national or war flag, or its canton on its own. France and some other countries use the same flag or ensign for all purposes, civil or military, and also as their naval jack. Japan and some other countries with civil and war ensigns of different designs fly the civil ensign as a jack and the war ensign at the ship&#x27;s stern. A shortened, square version of the national flag is used by some countries. A larger group of jacks show the country&#x27;s national coat of arms, either as a banner of arms, or as a badge displayed on the field. Most countries have chosen a completely different design for their naval jacks, often with some national or maritime symbol, and usually with the same colours as in their flags.

== War ensign as jack ==
Countries that use their war ensign also as a jack will usually fly a smaller version at the bow.

== Square version of national flag as jack ==

== Canton of national ensign as jack ==
== National coat of arms as jack ==

==National flag in canton as jack==
== Jacks of special design ==
== Cross and Saltire Jacks ==
== Union jacks ==

United or confederated states have in many cases adopted a jack representing their national union. The best known is the Union Jack of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy, composed in 1606 by joining the flags of England and Scotland. When the Kingdom of Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801, a red saltire (Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cross) was added to form the present Union Flag. The design of the UK&#x27;s Union Jack probably inspired later jacks of other states, such as Russia and the Union Jack of Sweden and Norway. The Russian jack in its turn inspired the jacks of Bulgaria, Estonia, and Latvia.

From 1777 to 1975, 1977 to September 2002, and June 2019 to the present, the United States Navy has flown a &quot;union jack&quot;, consisting of the blue canton with white stars from the US national ensign. In 1975 and 1976, and then again from September 11, 2002, to June 4, 2019, the US Navy flew the First Navy Jack, allegedly used in 1775 and 1776, with a rattlesnake and the motto &quot;DONT TREAD ON ME&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] superimposed on thirteen alternating red and white stripes.

The Confederate States of America followed the same pattern for its first naval jack (1861–1863), using the canton of its first naval ensign, with seven stars forming a circle on a &quot;medium blue&quot; field. Later versions had up to fifteen stars. The second Confederate naval jack was a rectangular cousin of the Confederate army&#x27;s battle flag and was in use from 1863 until 1865.

The Union Jack of Sweden and Norway (1844–1905) was a rectangular cross flag divided per saltire, combining the national colours of Sweden (hoist and fly) and Norway (top and bottom). The naval jack was also used as a flag for the common diplomatic representations abroad.

<doc id="619602" wikidata="Q4712977" url="?curid=619602" title="Genitourinary system">
<text>The genitourinary system, or urogenital system, are the sex organs of the reproductive system and the organs of the urinary system. These are grouped together because of their proximity to each other, their common embryological origin and the use of common pathways. Because of this, the systems are sometimes imaged together. In placental mammals (including humans), the male urethra goes through and opens into the penis while the female urethra and vagina empty through the vulva. 

The term &quot;apparatus urogenitalis&quot; was used in &quot;Nomina Anatomica&quot; (under splanchnologia) but is not used in the current &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;.

==Development==

The urinary and reproductive organs are developed from the intermediate mesoderm. The permanent organs of the adult are preceded by a set of structures that are purely embryonic and that, with the exception of the ducts, disappear almost entirely before the end of fetal life. These embryonic structures are on either side: the pronephros, the mesonephros and the metanephros of the kidney, and the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts of the sex organ. The pronephros disappears very early; the structural elements of the mesonephros mostly degenerate, but the gonad is developed in their place, with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the Müllerian as that of the female. Some of the tubules of the mesonephros form part of the permanent kidney.

== Structures ==

=== Urethra ===

==== Female Urethra ====
The urethra of an adult human female is 3-4 cm long. The female urethra is located between the bladder neck to the external urethral orifice and is behind the symphysis pubis.The urethral wall is composed of an inner epithelial lining, a sub-mucosa layer containing vascular supply, a thin fascial layer, and two layers of smooth muscle.

==== Male Urethra ====
The urethra of an adult human male is 18-20 cm long. It has a diameter of 8-9 mm.The male urethra is divided into two sections.

==Disorders==
Disorders of the genitourinary system includes a range of disorders from those that are asymptomatic to those that manifest an array of signs and symptoms. Causes for these disorders include congenital anomalies, infectious diseases, trauma, or conditions that secondarily involve the urinary structure.

To gain access to the body, pathogens can penetrate mucous membranes lining the genitourinary tract.

=== Malformations ===
Urogenital malformations include:
*Hypospadias
*Epispadias
*Labial fusion
*Varicocele

As a medical specialty, genitourinary pathology is the subspecialty of surgical pathology which deals with the diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the urinary tract, male genital tract and testes. However, medical disorders of the kidneys are generally within the expertise of renal pathologists. Genitourinary pathologists generally work closely with urologic surgeons.

<doc id="619615" wikidata="Q333120" url="?curid=619615" title="Lord George Gordon">
<text>Lord George Gordon (26 December 1751 – 1 November 1793) was a British nobleman and politician best known for lending his name to the Gordon Riots of 1780. An eccentric and flighty personality, he was born into the Scottish nobility and sat in the House of Commons from 1774 to 1780. His life ended after a number of controversies, notably one surrounding his conversion to Judaism, for which he was ostracised. He died in Newgate Prison.

==Early life==
George Gordon was born in London, England, third and youngest son of Cosmo George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon, and his wife, Catherine, and the brother of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. In 1759 he had been bought an ensign&#x27;s commission in the army&#x27;s 89th (Highland) Regiment of Foot, then commanded by his stepfather Staats Long Morris, but after completing his education at Eton, he entered the Royal Navy in 1763 at the age of 12. He received promotion to the rank of lieutenant, but his career stagnated and he received no further promotions. His behaviour in raising the poor living conditions of his sailors led to his being mistrusted by his fellow officers, although it contributed to his popularity amongst ordinary seamen. Lord Sandwich, then at the head of the Admiralty, refused to promise him immediate command of a ship, and he resigned his commission in 1777, without having served during the American War of Independence, which he politically opposed.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1774 general election Gordon was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall. The pocket borough had been bought for him by General Fraser, to fend off Gordon&#x27;s threat to oppose him in Inverness-shire. Gordon was considered flighty, and was not looked upon as being of any importance. From the moment he entered 
Parliament he was a strong critic of the government&#x27;s colonial policy in regard to America. He became a supporter of American independence and often spoke out in favour of the colonies.

His chances of building a political following in parliament were damaged by his inconsistency and his tendency to criticise all the major political factions. He was just as likely to attack the radical opposition spokesman Charles James Fox in a speech as he was to challenge Lord North, the Tory Prime Minister. His chances of being returned at the 1780 general election were overtaken by events. He remained close to political life, and after being acquitted at his trial in 1781, he declared his intention of standing for the City of London, but withdrew.

==The Gordon Riots==
In 1779 he organised, and made himself head of, the Protestant Association, formed to secure the repeal of the Papists Act 1778, which had restored limited civil rights to Roman Catholics willing to swear certain oaths of loyalty to the Crown.

On 2 June 1780 he headed a crowd of around 50,000 people that marched in procession from St George&#x27;s Fields just south of London to the Houses of Parliament in order to present a huge petition against (partial) Catholic emancipation. After the mob reached Westminster the &quot;Gordon Riots&quot; began. Initially, the mob dispersed after threatening to force their way into the House of Commons, but reassembled soon afterwards and, over several days, destroyed several Roman Catholic chapels, pillaged the private dwellings of Catholics, set fire to Newgate Prison, broke open all the other prisons, and attacked the Bank of England and several other public buildings. The army was finally brought in to quell the unrest and killed or wounded around 450 people before they finally restored order.

For his role in instigating the riots, Lord George was charged with high treason. He was comfortably imprisoned in the Tower of London and permitted to receive visitors, including the Methodist leader Rev. John Wesley on Tuesday 19 December 1780 who may have shared the condemning opinion of his brother Charles Wesley.

Thanks to a strong defence by his cousin, Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine, he was acquitted on the grounds that he had had no treasonable intent.

==Imprisonment==
In 1786 he was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury for refusing to bear witness in an ecclesiastical suit, and in 1787 he was convicted of defaming Marie Antoinette, Jean-Balthazar d&#x27;Adhémar (the French ambassador to Great Britain) and the administration of justice in England. He was, however, permitted to withdraw from the court without bail, and made his escape to the Netherlands. On account of representations from the court of Versailles he was commanded to leave that country, and, returning to England, was apprehended in Birmingham, and in January 1788 was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment in Newgate and some harsh additional conditions.

==Conversion to Judaism==

In 1787, at the age of 36, Lord George Gordon converted to Judaism in Birmingham (though other sources report the conversion occurred slightly earlier when in Holland in the Netherlands), and underwent brit milah (ritual circumcision; circumcision was rare in the England of his day) at the synagogue in Severn Street now next door to Singers Hill Synagogue. He took the name of Yisrael bar Avraham Gordon (&quot;Israel son of Abraham&quot; Gordon—since Judaism regards a convert as the spiritual &quot;son&quot; of the Biblical Abraham). Gordon thus became what Judaism regards as, and Jews call, a &quot;Ger Tsedek&quot;—a righteous convert.

Not much is known about his life as a Jew in Birmingham, but the &quot;Bristol Journal&quot; of 15 December 1787 reported that Gordon had been living in Birmingham since August 1786:
He lived with a Jewish woman in the Froggery, a marshy area now under New Street station.
While in prison, Gordon lived the life of an Orthodox Jew, and he adjusted his prison life to his circumstances. He put on his &quot;tzitzit&quot; and &quot;tefillin&quot; daily. He fasted when the &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) prescribed it, and likewise celebrated the Jewish holidays. He was supplied kosher meat and wine, and &quot;Shabbat challos&quot; by prison authorities. The prison authorities permitted him to have a &quot;minyan&quot; on the Jewish Sabbath and to affix a &quot;mezuza&quot; on the door of his cell. The Ten Commandments were also hung on his wall.

Gordon associated only with pious Jews; in his passionate enthusiasm for his new faith, he refused to deal with any Jew who compromised the Torah&#x27;s commandments. Although any non-Jew who desired to visit Gordon in prison (and there were many) was welcome, he requested that the prison guards admit Jews only if they had beards and wore head coverings.

He would often, in keeping with Jewish &quot;chesed&quot; (laws of mercy and charity), go into other parts of the prison to comfort prisoners by speaking with them and playing the violin. In keeping with &quot;tzedaka&quot; (charity) laws, he gave what little money he could to those in need.

Charles Dickens, in his novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, which centres around the Gordon Riots, describes Gordon as a true &quot;tzadik&quot; (pious man) among the prisoners:

On 28 January 1793, Lord George Gordon&#x27;s sentence expired and he had to appear to give claim to his future good behaviour. When appearing in court he was ordered to remove his hat, which he was using as a &quot;kippah&quot;, but he refused to do so. The hat was then taken from him by force, but he covered his head with a night cap and bound it with a handkerchief. He defended his behaviour by saying &quot;in support of the propriety of the creature having his head covered in reverence to the Creator.&quot; Before the court, he read a written statement in which he claimed that &quot;he had been imprisoned for five years among murderers, thieves, etc., and that all the consolation he had arose from his trust in God.&quot;

Although his brothers, the 4th Duke of Gordon and Lord William Gordon, and his sister, Lady Westmoreland, offered to cover his bail, Gordon refused their help, saying that to &quot;sue for pardon was a confession of guilt.&quot;

==Death==

In October 1793, Gordon caught typhoid fever, which had been raging in Newgate prison throughout that year. Christopher Hibbert, another biographer, writes that scores of prisoners waited outside the door to his cell for news about his health; friends, regardless of the risk of infection, stood whispering in the room and praying for his recovery – but George &quot;Yisrael bar Avraham&quot; Gordon died on 1 November 1793 (26 Mar-Cheshvan 5554) at the age of 41.

Most likely fearing desecration, Gordon was not buried in a Jewish cemetery but in the detached burial ground of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly (an Anglican church from which he had been excommunicated), which was located some way from the church, beside Hampstead Road, north of Warren Street – it later became St James&#x27;s Gardens but from June 2017 onwards its burials were reinterred elsewhere to make way for HS2 expansions to Euston station.

Gordon&#x27;s life story can be found in Yirmeyahu Bindman&#x27;s dramatized biography, &quot;Lord George Gordon&quot; (1992), and a defence of his actions is undertaken in Robert Watson&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Lord George Gordon, with a Philosophical Review of his Political Conduct&quot; (1795). He is also one of the subjects included by Hugh MacDiarmid in the volume &quot;Scottish Eccentrics&quot; (1936). Historical accounts of Lord George Gordon can be found in &quot;The Annual Registers&quot; from 1780 to the year of his death.

<text>Crawinkel is a village and a former municipality in the district of Gotha, Thuringia, Germany. Since 1 January 2019, it is part of the town Ohrdruf. Crawinkel was first mentioned in 1088.

After the Armistice with France in 1940, during World War II, German forces took numerous memorials from the forest of Compiègne, where the Armistice with Germany that ended World War I was also signed, as prizes to Crawinkel. These included the actual railway carriage where both armistices were concluded. In 1945, the car was dynamited and its pieces buried. Since the German reunification in 1989, numerous artifacts have been recovered and returned to France.

<text>HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; (F42) was a frigate of the Royal Navy (RN). She was, like the rest of her class, named after a figure of mythology. Built by Alexander Stephen and Sons on the River Clyde, she was launched on 19 December 1964 and commissioned on 15 May 1966.

==Construction and description==
&quot;Phoebe&quot; was ordered during 1962 as one of the first Batch 2 &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates. The ship was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons Linthouse, Glasgow shipyard on 25 July 1963, was launched on 19 December 1964 and completed on 14 May 1966. She commissioned with the pennant number F42 on 15 May 1966.

&quot;Phoebe&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was fitted with Y-136 machinery, built by Cammell Laird. Two oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by a quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher on the hangar roof, while two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for close-in defence against surface targets. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Phoebe&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried over the ship&#x27;s bridge to direct the 4.5-inch guns, while a GWS22 director for Seacat was mounted on the hangar roof. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

==Operational service==
In the year of her commission, &quot;Phoebe&quot; assisted in the emotionally charged withdrawal from Aden in 1967. In 1969, &quot;Phoebe&quot; took part in the 20th Anniversary of NATO Fleet Review held at Spithead.

In February 1970, &quot;Phoebe&quot; undertook a 10-month overseas deployment, which included three assignments to the Beira Patrol off Mozambique in an attempt to stop the supply of oil to Rhodesia in contravention of an oil embargo. In April 1970, &quot;Phoebe&quot; left her Mozambique patrol to assist in the Indian Ocean as part of an Apollo 13 splashdown secondary task force. In 1971, &quot;Phoebe&quot; deployed to the West Indies. That same year, &quot;Phoebe&quot; was guard ship during talks between British Prime Minister Edward Heath and U.S. President Richard Nixon. She suffered minor damage when the frigate collided with her whilst attempting to leave Portsmouth Harbour during the first week in November 1971. In 1973, &quot;Phoebe&quot; took part in the Second Cod War, during the fishing disputes with Iceland.
Between 1973 and 1977 &quot;Phoebe&quot; was used for the filming of the popular &quot;Warship&quot; BBC drama, set on board the fictional HMS &quot;Hero&quot;.

In 1974, &quot;Phoebe&quot; commenced her modernisation, which including altering her weapons configuration. Her single 4.5-inch twin turret was removed in favour of the Exocet anti-ship missile system, giving her a powerful anti-surface capability. The number of SeaCat missiles she carried was increased. The modernisation was completed in 1977. She subsequently took part in the Silver Jubilee celebrations and Fleet Review, at which many warships attended from a variety of nations.

During late 1977 and early 1978, &quot;Phoebe&quot; led a task force on active service to the South Atlantic (Falklands) in company with , and RFA&#x27;s &quot;Resurgent&quot; and &quot;Olwen&quot; calling at Funchal, Madeira before returning home.

In 1978, &quot;Phoebe&quot; patrolled in the Caribbean and subsequently joined Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a multi-national squadron of NATO in company with USS &quot;Pharris&quot;, the German frigate &quot;Emden&quot;, HMCS &quot;Okanagan&quot; and the Dutch frigate &quot;Tjerk Hiddes&quot;. In that year, &quot;Phoebe&quot; had the distinction of becoming the first frigate to operate the Westland Lynx attack helicopter aka &#x27;Phelix&#x27;, which remains in service, though obviously of a newer variant.In February 1981, &quot;Phoebe&quot; was refitted with Towed array sonar type 2031.

In September 1982, &quot;Phoebe&quot; deployed to the South Atlantic in the aftermath of the Falklands War, and performed a number of duties, though mainly patrolling in that region. In 1984, &quot;Phoebe&quot; completed her towed array sonar refit. In 1988, &quot;Phoebe&quot; again served under Standing Naval Force Atlantic and took part in the rescue effort in the tragic aftermath of the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion in the North Sea, which killed 167 people. &quot;Phoebe&quot; decommissioned in 1991 and was sold for scrap the following year. Some of her notable Commanding Officers include P E C Berger, G I Pritchard, Hugh Balfour and Jonathon Band.

&quot;Phoebe&quot; was adopted by the people of Bournemouth. In 1986 the freedom of the Borough of Bournemouth was conferred on her. In the Bournemouth Central Gardens there is a memorial seat dedicated to her as presented by the HMS Phoebe Association.

<text>Transfection is the process of deliberately introducing naked or purified nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells. It may also refer to other methods and cell types, although other terms are often preferred: &quot;transformation&quot; is typically used to describe non-viral DNA transfer in bacteria and non-animal eukaryotic cells, including plant cells. In animal cells, transfection is the preferred term, as the term &quot;transformation&quot; is also used to refer to a cell&#x27;s progression to a cancerous state (carcinogenesis). Transduction is often used to describe virus-mediated gene transfer into prokaryotic cells.

The word &quot;transfection&quot; is a portmanteau of the prefix &quot;trans-&quot; and the word &quot;infection.&quot; Genetic material (such as supercoiled plasmid DNA or siRNA constructs), may be transfected. Transfection of animal cells typically involves opening transient pores or &quot;holes&quot; in the cell membrane to allow the uptake of material. Transfection can be carried out using calcium phosphate (i.e. tricalcium phosphate), by electroporation, by cell squeezing, or by mixing a cationic lipid with the material to produce liposomes that fuse with the cell membrane and deposit their cargo inside.

Transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells.

==Terminology==
The meaning of the term has evolved. The original meaning of transfection was &quot;infection by transformation&quot;, i.e., introduction of genetic material, DNA or RNA, from a prokaryote-infecting virus or bacteriophage into cells, resulting in an infection. For work with bacterial and archaeal cells transfection retains its original meaning as a special case of transformation. Because the term transformation had another sense in animal cell biology (a genetic change allowing long-term propagation in culture, or acquisition of properties typical of cancer cells), the term transfection acquired, for animal cells, its present meaning of a change in cell properties caused by introduction of DNA.

==Methods==
There are various methods of introducing foreign DNA into a eukaryotic cell: some rely on physical treatment (electroporation, cell squeezing, nanoparticles, magnetofection); others rely on chemical materials or biological particles (viruses) that are used as carriers. There are many different methods of gene delivery developed for various types of cells and tissues, from bacterial to mammalian. Generally, the methods can be divided into three categories: physical, chemical, and biological.

Physical methods include electroporation, microinjection, gene gun, impalefection, hydrostatic pressure, continuous infusion, and sonication. Chemicals include methods such as lipofection, which is a lipid-mediated DNA-transfection process utilizing liposome vectors. It can also include the use of polymeric gene carriers (polyplexes). Biological transfection is typically mediated by viruses, utilizing the ability of a virus to inject its DNA inside a host cell. A gene that is intended for delivery is packaged into a replication-deficient viral particle. Viruses used to date include retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and herpes simplex virus.

===Physical methods===

Physical methods are the conceptually simplest, using some physical means to force the transfected material into the target cell&#x27;s nucleus. The most widely used physical method is electroporation, where short electrical pulses disrupt the cell membrane, allowing the transfected nucleic acids to enter the cell. Other physical methods use different means to poke holes in the cell membrane: Sonoporation uses high-intensity ultrasound (attributed mainly to the cavitation of gas bubbles interacting with nearby cell membranes), optical transfection uses a highly focused laser to form a ~1 μm diameter hole. 

Several methods use tools that force the nucleic acid into the cell, namely: microinjection of nucleic acid with a fine needle; biolistic particle delivery, in which nucleic acid is attached to heavy metal particles (usually gold) and propelled into the cells at high speed; and magnetofection, where nucleic acids are attached to magnetic iron oxide particles and driven into the target cells by magnets.

Hydrodynamic delivery is a method used in mice and rats, in which nucleic acids can be delivered to the liver by injecting a relatively large volume in the blood in less than 10 seconds; nearly all of the DNA is expressed in the liver by this procedure.

===Chemical methods===
Chemical-based transfection can be divided into several kinds: cyclodextrin, polymers, liposomes, or nanoparticles (with or without chemical or viral functionalization. See below).

*One of the cheapest methods uses calcium phosphate, originally discovered by F. L. Graham and A. J. van der Eb in 1973 (see also). HEPES-buffered saline solution (HeBS) containing phosphate ions is combined with a calcium chloride solution containing the DNA to be transfected. When the two are combined, a fine precipitate of the positively charged calcium and the negatively charged phosphate will form, binding the DNA to be transfected on its surface. The suspension of the precipitate is then added to the cells to be transfected (usually a cell culture grown in a monolayer). By a process not entirely understood, the cells take up some of the precipitate, and with it, the DNA. This process has been a preferred method of identifying many oncogenes.
*Another method is the use of cationic polymers such as DEAE-dextran or polyethylenimine (PEI). The negatively charged DNA binds to the polycation and the complex is taken up by the cell via endocytosis.
*Lipofection (or liposome transfection) is a technique used to inject genetic material into a cell by means of liposomes, which are vesicles that can easily merge with the cell membrane since they are both made of a phospholipid bilayer. Lipofection generally uses a positively charged (cationic) lipid (cationic liposomes or mixtures) to form an aggregate with the negatively charged (anionic) genetic material. This transfection technology performs the same tasks as other biochemical procedures utilizing polymers, DEAE-dextran, calcium phosphate, and electroporation. The efficiency of lipofection can be improved by treating transfected cells with a mild heat shock.
* Fugene is a series of widely used proprietary non-liposomal transfection reagents capable of directly transfecting a wide variety of cells with high efficiency and low toxicity.
*Dendrimer is a class of highly branched molecules based on various building blocks and synthesized through a convergent or a divergent method. These dendrimers bind the nucleic acids to form dendriplexes that then penetrate the cells.

===Viral methods===
DNA can also be introduced into cells using viruses as a carrier. In such cases, the technique is called transduction, and the cells are said to be transduced. Adenoviral vectors can be useful for viral transfection methods because they can transfer genes into a wide variety of human cells and have high transfer rates. Lentiviral vectors are also helpful due to their ability to transduce cells not currently undergoing mitosis.

Protoplast fusion is a technique in which transformed bacterial cells are treated with lysozyme in order to remove the cell wall. Following this, fusogenic agents (e.g., Sendai virus, PEG, electroporation) are used in order to fuse the protoplast carrying the gene of interest with the target recipient cell. A major disadvantage of this method is that bacterial components are non-specifically introduced into the target cell as well.

==Stable and transient transfection==
Stable and transient transfection differ in their long term effects on a cell; a stably transfected cell will continuously express transfected DNA and pass it on to daughter cells, while a transiently transfected cell will express transfected DNA for a short amount of time and not pass it on to daughter cells.

For some applications of transfection, it is sufficient if the transfected genetic material is only transiently expressed. Since the DNA introduced in the transfection process is usually not integrated into the nuclear genome, the foreign DNA will be diluted through mitosis or degraded. Cell lines expressing the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) or the SV40 large-T antigen allow episomal amplification of plasmids containing the viral EBV (293E) or SV40 (293T) origins of replication, greatly reducing the rate of dilution.

If it is desired that the transfected gene actually remain in the genome of the cell and its daughter cells, a stable transfection must occur. To accomplish this, a marker gene is co-transfected, which gives the cell some selectable advantage, such as resistance towards a certain toxin. Some (very few) of the transfected cells will, by chance, have integrated the foreign genetic material into their genome. If the toxin is then added to the cell culture, only those few cells with the marker gene integrated into their genomes will be able to proliferate, while other cells will die. After applying this selective stress (selection pressure) for some time, only the cells with a stable transfection remain and can be cultivated further.

Common agents for selecting stable transfection are:

* Geneticin, or G418, neutralized by the product of the neomycin resistance gene
* Puromycin
* Zeocin
* Hygromycin B
* Blasticidin S

==RNA transfection==
RNA can also be transfected into cells to transiently express its coded protein, or to study RNA decay kinetics. RNA transfection is often used in primary cells that do not divide.

siRNAs can also be transfected to achieve RNA silencing (i.e. loss of RNA and protein from the targeted gene). This has become a major application in research to achieve &quot;knock-down&quot; of proteins of interests (e.g. Endothelin-1) with potential applications in gene therapy. Limitation of the silencing approach are the toxicity of the transfection for cells and potential &quot;off-target&quot; effects on the expression of other genes/proteins.

RNA can be purified from cells after lysis or synthesized from free nucleotides either chemically, or enzymatically using an RNA polymerase to transcribe a DNA template. As with DNA, RNA can be delivered to cells by a variety of means including microinjection, electroporation, and lipid-mediated transfection. If the RNA encodes a protein, transfected cells may translate the RNA into the encoded protein. If the RNA is a regulatory RNA (such as a miRNA), the RNA may cause other changes in the cell (such as RNAi-mediated knockdown).

Encapsulating the RNA molecule in lipid nanoparticles was a breakthrough for producing viable RNA vaccines, solving a number of key technical barriers in delivering the RNA molecule into the human cell.

RNA molecules shorter than about 25nt (nucleotides) largely evade detection by the innate immune system, which is triggered by longer RNA molecules. Most cells of the body express proteins of the innate immune system, and upon exposure to exogenous long RNA molecules, these proteins initiate signaling cascades that result in inflammation. This inflammation hypersensitizes the exposed cell and nearby cells to subsequent exposure. As a result, while a cell can be repeatedly transfected with short RNA with few non-specific effects, repeatedly transfecting cells with even a small amount of long RNA can cause cell death unless measures are taken to suppress or evade the innate immune system (see &quot;Long-RNA transfection&quot; below).

Short-RNA transfection is routinely used in biological research to knock down the expression of a protein of interest (using siRNA) or to express or block the activity of a miRNA (using short RNA that acts independently of the cell&#x27;s RNAi machinery, and therefore is not referred to as siRNA). While DNA-based vectors (viruses, plasmids) that encode a short RNA molecule can also be used, short-RNA transfection does not risk modification of the cell&#x27;s DNA, a characteristic that has led to the development of short RNA as a new class of macromolecular drugs.

Long-RNA transfection is the process of deliberately introducing RNA molecules longer than about 25nt into living cells. A distinction is made between short- and long-RNA transfection because exogenous long RNA molecules elicit an innate immune response in cells that can cause a variety of nonspecific effects including translation block, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis.

===Endogenous vs. exogenous long RNA===
The innate immune system has evolved to protect against infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and triggering a complex set of responses collectively known as inflammation. Many cells express specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for exogenous RNA including toll-like receptor 3,7,8 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8), the RNA helicase RIG1 (RARRES3), protein kinase R (PKR, a.k.a. EIF2AK2), members of the oligoadenylate synthetase family of proteins (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3), and others. All of these proteins can specifically bind to exogenous RNA molecules and trigger an immune response.
The specific chemical, structural or other characteristics of long RNA molecules that are required for recognition by PRRs remain largely unknown despite intense study. At any given time, a typical mammalian cell may contain several hundred thousand mRNA and other, regulatory long RNA molecules. How cells distinguish exogenous long RNA from the large amount of endogenous long RNA is an important open question in cell biology. Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of the 5&#x27;-end of a long RNA molecule can influence its immunogenicity, and specifically that 5&#x27;-triphosphate RNA, which can be produced during viral infection, is more immunogenic than 5&#x27;-diphosphate RNA, 5&#x27;-monophosphate RNA or RNA containing no 5&#x27; phosphate. However, in vitro-transcribed (ivT) long RNA containing a 7-methylguanosine cap (present in eukaryotic mRNA) is also highly immunogenic despite having no 5&#x27; phosphate, suggesting that characteristics other than 5&#x27;-phosphorylation can influence the immunogenicity of an RNA molecule.

Eukaryotic mRNA contains chemically modified nucleotides such as &quot;N&quot;6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, and 2&#x27;-O-methylated nucleotides. Although only a very small number of these modified nucleotides are present in a typical mRNA molecule, they may help prevent mRNA from activating the innate immune system by disrupting secondary structure that would resemble double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a type of RNA thought to be present in cells only during viral infection.
The immunogenicity of long RNA has been used to study both innate and adaptive immunity.

===Repeated long-RNA transfection===
Inhibiting only three proteins, interferon-β, STAT2, and EIF2AK2 is sufficient to rescue human fibroblasts from the cell death caused by frequent transfection with long, protein-encoding RNA. Inhibiting interferon signaling disrupts the positive-feedback loop that normally hypersensitizes cells exposed to exogenous long RNA. Researchers have recently used this technique to express reprogramming proteins in primary human fibroblasts.

<text>In Germanic paganism, Nerthus is a goddess associated with a ceremonial wagon procession. Nerthus is attested by first century A.D. Roman historian Tacitus in his ethnographic work &quot;Germania&quot; as a &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.

In &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus records that a group of Germanic peoples were particularly distinguished by their veneration of the goddess. Tacitus describes the wagon procession in some detail: Nerthus&#x27;s cart is found on an unspecified island in the &quot;ocean&quot;, where it is kept in a sacred grove and draped in white cloth. Only a priest may touch it. When the priest detects Nerthus&#x27;s presence by the cart, the cart is drawn by heifers. Nerthus&#x27;s cart is met with celebration and peacetime everywhere it goes, and during her procession no one goes to war and all iron objects are locked away. In time, after the goddess has had her fill of human company, the priest returns the cart to her &quot;temple&quot; and slaves ritually wash the goddess, her cart, and the cloth in a &quot;secluded lake&quot;. According to Tacitus, the slaves are then immediately drowned in the lake.

Scholars have linked Tacitus&#x27;s description of ceremonial wagons found from around Tacitus&#x27;s time up until the Viking Age, particularly the Germanic Iron Age Dejbjerg wagon in Denmark and the Viking Age Oseberg ship burial wagon in Norway. The goddess&#x27;s name &quot;Nerthus&quot; (from Proto-Germanic *&quot;Nerþuz&quot;) is the early Germanic etymological precursor to the Old Norse deity name &quot;Njörðr&quot;, a male deity who is comparably associated with wagons and water in Norse mythology. Together with his children Freyja and Freyr, the three form the Vanir, a family of deities. The Old Norse record contains three narratives featuring ritual wagon processions that scholars have compared to Tacitus&#x27;s description of Nerthus&#x27;s wagon procession, one of which (and potentially all of them) focus on Njörðr&#x27;s son Freyr.

Additionally, scholars have sought to explain the difference in gender between the early Germanic and Old Norse forms of the deity, discussed potential etymological connections to the obscure female deity name Njörun, mention of the mysterious Sister-wife of Njörðr, proposed a variety of locations for where the procession may have occurred (generally in Denmark), and considered Tacitus&#x27;s sources for his description.

Tacitus&#x27;s Nerthus has had some influence on popular culture, and in particular the now widely rejected manuscript reading of &quot;Hertha&quot; in Germany.

== Etymology ==

Scholars commonly identify the goddess Nerthus with Njörðr, a deity who is attested in Old Norse texts and in numerous Scandinavian place names. Scholars identify the Romano-Germanic &quot;Nerthus&quot; as the linguistic precursor to the Old Norse deity name &quot;Njörðr&quot; and have reconstructed the form as Proto-Germanic *&quot;Nerþuz&quot;. As outlined by philologist John McKinnell, &quot;Nerthus &gt; *&quot;Njarðuz&quot; (breaking) &gt; *&quot;Njǫrðuz&quot; &gt; &quot;Njǫrðr&quot;&quot;. Scholars have additionally linked both &quot;Nerthus&quot; and &quot;Njörðr&quot; to the obscure Old Norse goddess name &quot;Njörun&quot;.

The meaning of the theonym is unclear, but seems to be cognate with Old Irish &quot;nert&quot;, meaning &#x27;strength&#x27;, perhaps meaning &#x27;the powerful one&#x27;. The name may be related to Old English &#x27;, meaning &#x27;contented&#x27;, and the Old English place name &quot;Neorxnawang&quot;, used to gloss the word &#x27;paradise&#x27; in Old English texts, or the word &quot;north&quot;. According to philologist Jaan Puhvel, &quot;*Nerthuz is etymologically ambivalent, cognate not only with Old Irish &quot;nert&quot; &#x27;strength&#x27; and Greek &quot;andro&quot;- but with Vedic &quot;sū-nrt́ā&quot; &#x27;good vigor, vitality&#x27; (used especially for Uṣás, thus gender ambivalent)&quot;. According to McKinnell, &quot;The meaning of the name has usually been connected with Old Irish &#x27;strength&#x27; (so &#x27;the powerful one&#x27;), but it might be related to Old English &#x27; &#x27;contented&#x27; and &quot;neorxnawang&quot; &#x27;paradise&#x27; (literally &#x27;field of contentment&#x27;), or to the word &#x27;north&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;deity of the northern people&#x27;, cf. Greek &#x27;belonging to the underworld&#x27;).&quot;

== &quot;Germania&quot; ==
In chapter 40 of his ethnography &quot;Germania&quot;, Roman historian Tacitus, discussing the Suebian tribes of Germania, writes that, beside the populous Semnones and warlike Langobardi, there are seven more remote Suebian tribes; the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines, and Nuitones. The seven tribes are surrounded by rivers and forests and, according to Tacitus, there is nothing particularly worthy of comment about them as individuals, yet they are particularly distinguished as a group in that they all worship the goddess Nerthus. The chapter reads as follows:


== Tacitus&#x27;s sources ==
Tacitus does not provide information regarding his sources for his description of Nerthus (nor the rest of &quot;Germania&quot;). Tacitus&#x27;s account may stem from earlier but now lost literary works (such as perhaps Pliny the Elder&#x27;s lost &quot;Bella Germaniae&quot;), potentially his own experiences in Germania, or merchants and soldiers, such as Germanic peoples in Rome, or Germania and Romans who spent time in the region.

Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; places particular emphasis on the Semnones, and scholars have suggested that some or all of Tacitus&#x27;s information may come from King Masyas of the Semnones and/or his high priestess, the seeress Ganna. The two visited Rome for a blessing from Roman emperor Domitian in 92 AD. While Tacitus appears to have been away from Rome during this period, he would have had plenty of opportunity to gain information provided by King Masyas and Ganna from those who spent time with the two during their visit.

== Reception ==
Tacitus&#x27;s description of the Nerthus procession has been the subject of extensive discussion from scholars.

=== Name and manuscript variations ===
All surviving manuscripts of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; date from around the fifteenth century and these display significant variation in the name of the goddess: All attested forms are in accusative case and include &quot;Nertum&quot; (yielding the nominate form &quot;Nerthus&quot;), &quot;Herthum&quot; (implying a nominative form of &quot;Hertha&quot;) and several others (including &quot;Nechtum&quot;, &quot;Neithum&quot;, &quot;Neherthum&quot;, and &quot;Verthum&quot;).

Of the various forms found in the extant &quot;Germania&quot; manuscript tradition, two have yielded significant discussion among scholars since at least the nineteenth century, &quot;Nerthus&quot; and &quot;Hertha&quot;. Hertha was popular in some of the earliest layers of &quot;Germania&quot; scholarship, such as the edition of Beatus Rhenanus. These scholars linked the name with a common German word for &quot;Earth&quot; (compare modern German &quot;Erde&quot;). This reading has subsequently been rejected by most scholars. Since pioneering nineteenth century philologist Jacob Grimm&#x27;s identification of the form Nerthus as the etymological precursor to the Old Norse deity name &quot;Njǫrðr&quot;, the reading &quot;Nerthus&quot; has been widely accepted as correct in scholarship.

In 1902, the Codex Aesinas (often abbreviated as &quot;E&quot;) was discovered, and it was also found to contain the form &quot;Nertum&quot;, yielding the reading &quot;Nerthus&quot;. The Codex Aesinas is a fifteenth-century composite manuscript that is considered a direct copy of the Codex Hersfeldensis, the oldest identifiable manuscript of the text. All other manuscripts of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; are thought by scholars to stem from the Codex Aesinas.

Some scholars have continued suggesting alternate readings to &quot;Nerthus&quot;. For example, in 1992, Lotte Motz proposes that the linguistic correspondence is a coincidence and that &quot;The variant &quot;nertum&quot; was chosen by Grimm &quot;because&quot; it corresponds to Njǫrðr&quot;.
Instead, Motz propose that various female entities from the continental Germanic folklore record, particularly those in central Germany and the Alps, stem from a single source, whom she identifies as Nerthus, and that migrating Germanic peoples brought the goddess to those regions from coastal Scandinavia. After her death, Motz&#x27;s proposal received support from Rudolf Simek. John Lindow rejects Motz&#x27;s proposal and Simek&#x27;s support. He highlights the presence of the form in the Codex Aesinas (discovered in 1902, while Grimm died in 1863), and asks, &quot;would it not be an extraordinary coincidence that a deity who fits the pattern of the later fertility gods should have a name that is etymologically identical with one of them?&quot;

=== Location ===
Scholars have proposed a variety of locations for Tacitus&#x27;s account of Nerthus. For example, Anders Andrén says:

:In the accounts of specific Germanic tribes, Tacitus also writes about the divine twins, the Alcis, among the Naharvali, and about the goddess Nerthus among a group of tribes, probably located in the southern part of present-day Denmark.

Some scholars have proposed that the location of the Nerthus procession occurred on Zealand in Denmark. They link the Nerthus with the medieval place name &quot;Niartharum&quot; (modern Nærum) located on Zealand. Further justification is given in that Lejre, the seat of the ancient kings of Denmark, is also located on Zealand. Nerthus is then commonly compared to the goddess Gefjon, who is said to have plowed the island of Zealand from Sweden in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and in Lejre wed the legendary Danish king Skjöldr.

Chambers notes that the mistaken name &quot;Hertha&quot; (see &quot;Name and manuscript variations&quot; above) led to the hydronym &quot;Herthasee&quot;, a lake on the German island of Rügen, which antiquarians proposed as a potential location of the Nerthus site described in Tacitus. However, along with the rejection of the reading &quot;Hertha&quot;, the location is no longer considered to be a potential site.

=== Gender difference between Nerthus and Njörðr === 
Although &quot;Njörðr&quot; etymologically descends from *&quot;Nerþuz&quot;, Tacitus describes Nerthus female while the Old Norse deity Njörðr is male. The form *&quot;Nerþuz&quot; does not indicate whether the deity was considered male or female. This difference in gender between the two has resulted in significant discussion from scholars. A variety of reasons for this difference have been proposed: Over the years, scholars have variously proposed that that Nerthus was likely one of a pair of deities in a manner similar to Njörðr&#x27;s incestuous children Freyr and Freyja (perhaps involving &quot;hieros gamos&quot;), that Nerthus was a hermaphroditic deity, that the deity&#x27;s gender simply changed from female to male over time, or that Tacitus&#x27;s account mistakes Nerthus for a female deity rather than male deity. Others have proposed that a &#x27;female Njörðr&#x27; continues into the Old Norse corpus as the Sister-wife of Njörðr and/or in the goddess name &quot;Njörun&quot;.

=== Wagons, wagon processions, the Vanir, and cyclical rituals ===
Scholars associate Tacitus&#x27;s description of Nerthus&#x27;s &quot;vehiculum&quot; (translated above by Birley as &quot;chariot&quot; and by Mattingly as &quot;cart&quot;) ritually deposited in a &quot;lacus&quot; (translated by Birley and Mattingly above as &quot;lake&quot;) with ceremonial wagons found ritually placed in peat bogs around Tacitus&#x27;s time, ceremonial wagons from the Viking Age, and descriptions of ceremonial wagon processions in Old Norse texts. Notable examples include the Dejbjerg wagon—in fact a composite of two wagons—discovered in western Jutland, Denmark. A wagon from the Viking Age was found in the Oseberg ship burial in Norway. This wagon may have been incapable of turning corners and may have been used solely for ritual purposes. The ship burial contains tapestry fragments, today known as the Oseberg tapestry fragments. These fragments depict a wagon procession.
In Norse mythology, Njörðr is strongly associated with water, and he and his children, Freyr and Freyja, are particularly associated with wagons. Together this family is known in Old Norse sources as the Vanir. Njörðr is referred to as &quot;god of wagons&quot; (Old Norse &quot;vagna guð&quot;) in the principal manuscript of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (the Codex Regius).
According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Freyja drives a chariot driven by cats, which scholars have linked to the depiction of nine cats on the Oseberg ship burial wagon, potentially indicating a wagon procession featuring the goddess. Dated to the fourteenth century, &quot;Ögmundar þáttr dytts&quot; tells of a ritual wagon procession wherein a depiction of Freyr is driven around in a wagon by a priestess in a manner scholars have compared to Tacitus&#x27;s description.

Similar wagon procession-narratives may be found in two other texts, namely a description of a deity name Lýtir in &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; and one featuring Frotho in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, who is driven around for three days after his death so that the country wouldn&#x27;t crumble. Both of these names have been interpreted by scholars as likely bynames for Freyr.

Some scholars have interpreted this to reflect that this procession occurred as a cyclic ritual associated with the Vanir. According to Jens Peter Schjødt,
: &quot;if we accept a close relationship among, perhaps even an identity of, Nerthus, Freyr, and Frotho ... it appears that these three descriptions are all part of a discourse connecting gods of the &quot;vanir&quot; type with circumambulations and thus with processions focusing on yearly rituals.&quot;
Schjødt further writes:
:Cyclical rituals have no doubt taken place during several millennia in the North as well as everywhere else. One of the most famous descriptions of such a ritual from the Early Iron Age is Tacitus&#x27;s description of the Nerthus ritual in &quot;Germania&quot; ch. 40. Although it is not said explicitly that this is a cyclical ritual, there is no doubt that it is recurring and that it involves the whole community. Like with most other rituals of this type, we are not told at what time of the year the Nerthus procession took place, but since it is clearly a ritual connected with fertility and peace, we may conjecture that it was not during the summer, which was the season for war and other kinds of male activities.

Hilda Davidson draws a parallel between these incidents and Tacitus&#x27;s account of Nerthus, suggesting that in addition a neck-ring-wearing female figure &quot;kneeling as if to drive a chariot&quot; also dates from the Bronze Age. Davidson says that the evidence suggests that similar customs as detailed in Tacitus&#x27;s account continued to exist during the close of the pagan period through worship of the Vanir.

=== Bog bodies ===

Known as bog bodies, numerous well-preserved human remains have been found in peat bogs in Northern Europe. Like the wagons interred in peat bogs discussed above, these bodies were intentionally and ritually placed. Various scholars have linked Tacitus&#x27;s description of drowned slaves in a &quot;lake&quot; as a reference to the interment of human corpses in peat bogs. For example, according to archaeologist Peter Vilhelm Glob:
:The description of the goddess&#x27; attendants in the lake on the completion of the rites recalls the sacrificed bog people. There is indeed much to suggest that the bog people were participants in ritual celebrations of this kind, which culminated in their death and deposition in the bogs.

=== &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and the Roman cult of Cybele ===

In his description of Nerthus, Tacitus refers to the goddess as &quot;Mother Earth&quot; (&quot;Terra Mater&quot;). This has been received by scholars in a variety of ways and affected early manuscript readings of the deity&#x27;s name (especially &quot;Herthum&quot;, see &quot;Name and manuscript variations&quot; section above). In his assessment of the Old Norse personification of earth (&quot;Jörð&quot;, a goddess in Norse mythology), McKinnell says that the Old Norse earth personification does not appear to be notably connected to the Vanir, Njörðr, and/or Nerthus. He concludes that &quot;it seems likely that Tacitus equates Nerthus with &quot;Terra Mater&quot; as an &quot;interpretatio Romana&quot;, a translation into terms his Roman readers would find familiar.&quot; John Lindow says that Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;identification with Mother Earth probably has much less to do with Jörd in Scandinavian mythology than with fertility goddesses in many cultures&quot;.

The Phrygian goddess Cybele had been absorbed into the Roman pantheon by Tacitus&#x27;s time, and Tacitus served as a priest in the cult of Cybele, which included duties such as washing a sacred cult stone. Similar to Tacitus&#x27;s description of Nerthus, Cybele was at times closely connected to or conflated with the concept of &quot;Terra Mater&quot; (&#x27;Mother Earth&#x27;) through her identity as &quot;Mater Deum&quot; (&#x27;Mother of the Gods&#x27;), and was at times depicted with a chariot pulled by lions.

== Modern influence ==
The minor planet 601 Nerthus is named after Nerthus. The form &quot;Hertha&quot; was adopted by several German football clubs.

Up until its superseding as the dominant reading, &quot;Hertha&quot; had some influence in German popular culture. For example, &quot;Hertha&quot; and &quot;Herthasee&quot; (see &quot;location&quot; section above) play major roles in German novelist Theodor Fontane&#x27;s 1896 novel &quot;Effi Briest&quot;.

Nerþuz is a character who appears in &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;.

<doc id="619635" wikidata="Q629336" url="?curid=619635" title="Sciarra Colonna">
<text>Giacomo Colonna, [[Prince]] of [[Palestrina]] (1270-1329), more commonly known by his bynames Sciarrillo or Sciarra, was a member of the powerful Colonna family. He is most famous for attacking Pope Boniface VIII and for crowning Louis IV of Germany as Holy Roman Emperor.

==Feud between the Colonna and Pope Boniface VIII==

The Colonna were a powerful family in papal Rome and constant - but unsuccessful - contenders in papal elections. The stalemate between the Colonna and the Orsini led to the election of Pope Celestine V, who quickly abdicated, and then Pope Boniface VIII in 1294. The new pope, who hailed from the relatively obscure Caetani family, looked for opportunities to enlarge his family&#x27;s power base, and found one in a dispute among the Colonna family: when Cardinal Giacomo Colonna - Sciarra&#x27;s uncle - disinherited his brothers Ottone, Matteo, and Landolfo in 1297, the three appealed to the Pope, who ordered Giacomo to return the land, and furthermore hand over the family strongholds Palestrina and other towns to the Papacy. When Giacomo refused, Boniface removed him from the College of Cardinals and excommunicated him and his followers. In turn, the Colonna disputed the legitimacy of Boniface&#x27;s election and declared Celestine the rightful pope. Eventually, Palestrina was stormed by papal forces.
==Outrage of Anagni==

The Colonna allied with the Pope&#x27;s other great enemy, Philip IV of France. In September 1303, Sciarra and Philip&#x27;s advisor, Guillaume de Nogaret, led a small force into Anagni to arrest Boniface VIII and bring him to France, where he was to stand trial. While the two managed to apprehend the Pope, Sciarra reportedly slapped the pope in the face in the process, which was accordingly dubbed the &quot;Outrage of Anagni&quot;. The attempt eventually failed after a few days, when locals freed the Pope. However, Boniface VIII died on 11 October, allowing France to dominate his weaker successors during the Avignon papacy.

==Later years==

The Colonna remained powerful in the papal states, especially during successive popes&#x27; absence. In 1328, Louis IV of Germany marched into Italy for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor. As Pope John XXII was residing in Avignon and had publicly declared that he would not crown Louis, the King decided to be crowned by a member of the Roman aristocracy, who proposed Sciarra Colonna. In honor of this event, the Colonna family was granted the privilege of using the imperial pointed crown on top of their coat of arms.

One year later, Sciarra Colonna died in Venice in 1329.

<text>Endingen (Low Alemannic: &quot;Ändinge am Kaiserstuehl&quot;) is a small German town located in southwest Germany, at the border with France. It lies at the northern border of a former volcano area called Kaiserstuhl. The population of Endingen is about 9,000.

==Geography==
===Geographic location===
The town of Endingen with the winegrowing villages Amoltern, Kiechlinsbergen and Königschaffhausen is located in the north of the Kaiserstuhl. The highest point of the community is lying in the south of the city core, the Katharinenberg, on top of which stands a chapel. With 492.4 m above sea level it is the third highest peak of the Kaiserstuhl.

===Climate===
The city is located in one of the warmest areas of Germany, the Kaiserstuhl. The Mediterranean climate is reflected in the quality of the wines grown.

The climate in this area is close to a Mediterranean microclimate, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. However, more year-round rain occurs than in the Rhine plateau because of the closeness to the Black Forest. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate). However, it is close to being humid subtropical (Cfa) due to the mean temperatures in July and August just under 22 °C. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few miles away which is considered to be one of the warmest places of Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area. 
===Neighbouring municipalities===
Neighboring communities are (clockwise from the west): Sasbach, Wyhl, Forchheim, Riegel, Bahlingen, Vogtsburg.

===City structure===
In addition to the town of Endingen itself, the three districts Amoltern, Kiechlinsbergen and Königschaffhausen belong to Endingen. At the same time, these form localities within the meaning of the Baden-Württemberg municipal code with their own town councils and mayors. In each of the localities administration offices are set up with the name &quot;Ortschaftsamt&quot;. The official designation of the districts is preceded by the name of the city and connected by hyphen adjusted the names of the neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are spatially identical to the former municipalities of the same name. The urban area is also divided into the four residential districts within the meaning of the Baden-Württemberg municipal code. These are residential district I (Endingen), residential district II (Amoltern), residential district III (Kiechlinsbergen) and residential district IV (Königschaffhausen). The districts each include only the villages of the same name.

==History==

Endingen is first found in sources in the year 862. It belonged to the Lords of Endingen for several centuries and then to the Lords of Üsenberg. In 1285 or 1286, Endingen received city rights. When the Lords of Üsenberg died out in 1379, the town passed to the Habsburgs and was eventually incorporated into Vorderösterreich. For a short time in the 15th century, Endingen held the status of an Imperial City (&quot;Reichsstadt&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1751, Endingen was the site of one of the last Witch Trials in Europe. On 24 April Anna Schnidenwind was burned as a witch. After the Peace of Pressburg (1805), Endingen was assigned with the rest of the Breisgau to Baden. At the same time, Endingen also became part of the Landkreis Emmendingen. The exception is Kiechlinsbergen, which belonged to the former administrative district of Freiburg before its incorporation.

In 1843, 358 citizens emigrated from the Kaiserstuhl area via Le Havre to Colonia Tovar, Venezuela, mainly from Endingen am Kaiserstuhl, Forchheim, Wyhl and Oberbergen. There they were settled after some turmoil at their present location. The farmers planted vegetables and fruits and also brewed Venezuela&#x27;s first beer; they built their houses in half-timbered style.

===Incorporations===

*December 1, 1971: Amoltern
*January 1, 1974: Kiechlinsbergen (1150th Anniversary in 2012)
*January 1, 1975: Königschaffhausen

==Sites of interest==
*Kaiserstühler Heimatmuseum
* Cheese museum Endingen
* Further Austria museum

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Economy===
Viticulture plays, as everywhere in the Kaiserstuhl, a prominent role. There is a wine cooperative in every town and in the city center. Furthermore, several independent wineries are located in the community. Königschaffhausen is especially known for its cherry cultivation. Several industrial and retail companies are located in Endingen.

===Education===
For preschoolers there are three kindergartens in the city center (Regenbogen, St. Elisabeth and Maria Quell) and in the winegrower villages one kindergarten each. The Endinger school center comprises an elementary school, the classes 5 to 7 of the Werkrealschule &quot;Nördlicher Kaiserstuhl&quot; (Werkrealschule together with the municipality Wyhl) as well as the Stefan Zweig- secondary school . The Maria Sibylla Merian Primary School in Kiechlinsbergen and Königschaffhausen welcomes elementary school students from the villages of Kiechlinsbergen and Königschaffhausen. There is also a primary school class. In addition, there is the Albert Schweitzer-Förderschule, which cares for pupils with learning difficulties and whose education has been extended since the year 2005 to full-time school.

===Courts===
The city Endingen belongs to the jurisdiction of the District Court Kenzingen.

===Transport===
Endingen is located south of the state road L113. The city is 5 km away from the A5 Frankfurt am Main - Basel motorway. Its train station lies at the Kaiserstuhl Railway. Direct trains leave to Riegel-Malterdingen (with connection to the Rhine Valley Railway), Breisach, and Gottenheim (both with connection to the Freiburg–Breisach railway. The nearest airport is the EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg, about 70 km south of Endingen.

==Town twinnings==

* Erstein, France
* Colonia Tovar, Venezuela
Since 1970, Endingen is twinned with the Alsatian town of Erstein in France, only about 30 kilometers down on the other side of the Rhine. The municipality of Colonia Tovar in Venezuela, which was partly co-founded by emigrants from Endingen, also maintains a twinning. There are also friendly relations with the French commune of Coulonges-sur-l&#x27;Autize in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of western France.

==People==
===Born in Endingen am Kaiserstuhl===
*Joseph Biechele - creator of Biechele Soap brand
*Augustin Tünger (1455-not after 1510) - author of the first German collection of Facetiae.
*Anton Benitz (1803-1858) - Founded Benitz Brewery, Pittsburgh, PA USA - later known as the Iron City Brewery, still in operation today as the Pittsburgh Brewing Company.

<text>Straight-through processing (STP) is a method used by financial companies to speed up financial transactions by processing without manual intervention (straight-through).

==Background==
Straight-through processing exists in numerous areas of financial services, such as payments processing.

Payments may be non-STP due to various reasons such as missing information, information which is not in a machine &quot;understandable&quot; form (such as name and address rather than a code), or human-readable instructions, e.g. &quot;Please credit urgently&quot;) or simply falls outside of rules for which the bank allows automatic processing (for example, payments of large value or in exotic currencies).

Traditionally, making payments involves many departments in a bank. Both initiating a payment to be sent and processing a received payment may take days. In the past, payments were initiated through numerous &quot;human-friendly&quot; (also known as paper-based) means, such as a human through a paper order, over the phone, or via fax. The payment order was input into the bank&#x27;s payment system, then confirmed by a supervisor. This confirmation ensured an accurate match of input versus order before sending the payment. When multiple banks, countries or currencies were involved, the process often took several hours. When the complexity of the payment was higher, the amount of labor increased and additional human intervention resulted in more risk of errors, longer processing time, and higher costs.

In most cases, banks levy charges for non-STP payments or for manual repairs. Alternatively, banks may not charge on a &quot;per repair&quot; basis, but rather levy heavier fees for correspondents that provide lower quality (lower STP) payments.

==STP==
STP was developed for equities trading in the early 1990s by James Karat in London for automated processing in the equity markets.

The process before STP was very antiquated: sales traders would have to fill in a deal ticket, blue for buy and red for sell. The order was invariably scribbled and mostly unreadable. Upon receiving the order, the trader would often execute an incorrect investment on the market. For example, if the client wished to purchase 100,000 shares, but the trader only executed 10,000, the runner would send out the contract for 1,000. In those days, there was a T+10 settlement so any errors were &quot;fixable&quot;. However, with the new introduction of T+5, the settlement arena changed, and STP was born. To reduce the risk of failed settlement, there could only be one &quot;golden source&quot; of information and that it was the responsibility of the sales trader to be correct as they had the power to correct any discrepancies with the client directly.

The goal of STP is to reduce the time it takes to process a transaction, in order to increase the likelihood that a contract or an agreement is settled on time. The concept has also been transferred into other sectors including energy (oil, gas) trading and banking, and financial planning.

Currently, the entire trade lifecycle, from initiation to settlement, is a complex labyrinth of manual processes that take several days. Such processing for equities transactions is commonly referred to as T+2 (trade date plus two days) processing, as it usually takes two business days from the &quot;trade&quot; being executed to the trade being settled. This means investors who are selling a security must deliver the certificate within two business days, and investors who are buying securities must send payment within two business days. But this process comes with higher risks through the occurrence of unsettled trades. Market conditions fluctuate, meaning a two-day window brings an inherent risk of unexpected losses that investors may be unable to pay for, or settle, their transactions.

Industry practitioners, particularly in the United States, viewed STP as meaning &quot;same-day&quot; settlement or faster, ideally minutes or even seconds. The goal was to minimise settlement risk for the execution of a trade and its settlement and clearing to occur simultaneously. However, for this to be achieved, multiple market participants must realize high levels of STP. In particular, transaction data would need to be made available on a just-in-time basis, which is a considerably harder goal to achieve for the financial services community than the application of STP alone. After all, STP itself is merely an efficient use of computers for transaction processing.

In the past, STP methods were used to help financial firms move to one-day trade settlement of equity transactions, as well as to meet the global demand resulting from the rapid growth of online trading. Now the concepts of STP are applied to reduce systemic and operational risk and to improve certainty of settlement and minimize operational costs.

=== Common misconceptions ===

There is often confusion within the trading world between STP and an electronic communication network (ECN). Although they are similar initiatives, ECN connects orders with those of other traders as well as staff liquidity provides. An ECN is also typically a bigger pool of orders than a standard STP.

When fully implemented, STP is able to provide asset managers, brokers and dealers, custodians, banks and other financial services with benefits including shorter processing cycles, reduced settlement risk, and lower operating costs. Some industry analysts believe that STP is not an achievable goal in the sense that firms are unlikely to find the cost/benefit to reach 100% automation. Instead, they promote the idea of improving levels of internal STP within a firm while encouraging groups of firms to work together to improve the quality of the automation of transaction information between themselves, either bilaterally or as a community of users (external STP). Other analysts, however, believe that STP will be achieved with the emergence of business process interoperability.

<doc id="619642" wikidata="Q863512" url="?curid=619642" title="Heckler &amp; Koch XM8">
<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch XM8 is a lightweight assault rifle system developed from the late 1990s to early 2000s. The rifle was designed by German small arms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch (H&amp;K), and shares design and engineering with their G36 rifle.

The XM8 design was originally part of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon program (OICW), which was developing a &quot;smart&quot; grenade launcher system with an underslung carbine rifle. The system was unable to meet performance and weight requirements and was eventually canceled. In the aftermath, the two portions of the OICW were separated, resulting in the XM8 and XM25 projects.

While the XM8 was being considered by the United States Army as a potential standard infantry rifle, to replace the M4 carbine, this project was put on hold in April 2005, and was formally canceled on October 31 of that year. The weapon was adopted by the Royal Malaysian Navy for its PASKAL special forces.

==History==
The U.S. Army&#x27;s purpose in contracting for this prototype weapon was to provide replacement options for the M16 rifle after the XM29 program ran into problems. The goal was a weapon that was cheaper, lighter, and more effective than the M16 and M4 series of weapons. The XM8 was not just one weapon but a system which could be reconfigured with appropriate parts to be any one of several variants from a short-barreled personal defense weapon to a bipod-equipped support weapon. It also included an integrated optical sight and IR laser aiming module/illuminator.

The XM8 was based on the rifle module of Alliant Techsystems&#x27;s XM29 OICW project, of which the weapon mechanisms were the responsibility of H&amp;K. Following the indefinite delay of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon program, the U.S. Army requested that the contractors design stand-alone weapons from the XM29&#x27;s kinetic energy and high explosive modules.

The first 30 XM8 prototypes were delivered by November 2003 for preliminary testing. Later, at least 200 developmental prototypes were procured. Among the complaints during testing was that the battery life was too low for the weapon&#x27;s powered sight system and some ergonomics issues. Two other key issues were reducing the weapon&#x27;s weight and increasing the heat resistance of the handguard, which would start to melt after firing too many rounds. The main testing was largely completed, and the army pushed for funding for a large field test. However, in 2004 Congress denied $26 million funding for 7,000 rifles to do a wide scale test fielding of the XM8 in 2005. At that time, the rifle still had developmental goals that were incomplete, primarily associated with the weapon&#x27;s weight; the battery life had been extended, and a more heat-resistant plastic handguard added. The earliest product brochure lists the target weight for the carbine variant at with the then current prototype at . The weight of the carbine prototype had since grown to according to a brochure released by HK and General Dynamics in January 2005.
During the same period, the Army came under pressure from other arms makers to open up the XM8 to competition. The main argument was that the weapon that was being adopted was a substantially different system than for the original competition that ATK and H&amp;K had actually won (see XM29). Other issues were that the army has a legislated obligation to prefer U.S.-based manufacturers, and that a previous agreement with Colt Defense required the army to involve Colt in certain small-arms programs. The XM8 program was put on hold in 2004. The exact reason why this happened is a matter of debate; some combination of the aforementioned technical issues, funding restrictions, and outside pressure being involved.

In 2005, the Army issued a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) for the OICW Increment One family of weapons. This RFP gave manufacturers six months to develop and deliver prototype weapons with requirements very similar to the XM8 capabilities, but with the addition of a squad automatic weapon (SAW) configuration. No XM8 prototypes have been shown that actually match the capabilities of the M249 (e.g. fast barrel replacement, high sustained rate of fire, belt feed). The OICW Increment One requirement for the SAW includes fast barrel replacement and high sustained rate of fire, but leaves the ammunition feed choice up to the manufacturer.

Funding for the M320 grenade launcher, a single-shot under-barrel grenade launcher similar to the M203 that was originally intended for the XM8, was approved. The launcher is heavier than the M203, but does offer some advantages, such as no need for special mounting hardware and loading from the side instead of the bottom, which enables use of longer-than-standard grenades.
The XM320 was designed for use with the existing inventory of M16s and M4s and is also compatible with the XM8. It can also be used as a stand-alone weapon.

As of July 19, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was put on an eight-week hold, with an indication given that the program was being restructured as a joint procurement program. On October 31, 2005, the OICW Increment One RFP was cancelled.

In an article in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, April 26, 2006 (Vol 43, page 30) it is stated that &quot;The US Army has again delayed the procurement of its future infantry weapons, this time for more than five years, and is working to field two interim guns in the meantime&quot;.

General Dynamics was involved in latter stages and H&amp;K had plans to produce the rifle at a plant in Georgia. H&amp;K was British-owned at the start of the project, but was later bought back by a group of German investors. Engineering work was done at facilities in the United States and Germany.

===Near cancellation===

The U.S. military&#x27;s XM8 program was almost canceled in the autumn of 2005 after being suspended earlier that year, but was limited to the use of Marines. Had this program not been specified, the XM8 system may have faced competition from weapons such as from the FN SCAR, Bushmaster ACR and HK416. It was later altered and entered as a candidate for the SCAR competition but was unsuccessful.

===Further testing===
In autumn 2007 the XM8 was compared to other firearms in a &#x27;dust test&#x27;. The competition was based on two previous tests that were conducted in summer 2006 and summer 2007 before the latest test in the autumn of 2007. In the summer 2007 test, M16 rifles and M4 carbines recorded a total of 307 stoppages. In the autumn 2007 test, the XM8 recorded only 127 stoppages in 60,000 total rounds while the M4 carbine had 882. The FN SCAR had 226 stoppages and the HK416 had 233. The difference between the XM8, HK416, and FN SCAR was not statistically significant when correcting for the less reliable STANAG magazine. However, the discrepancy of 575 stoppages between the summer and autumn 2007 tests of the M4 had officials looking into possible causes for the change such as different officials, seasons, and inadequate sample pool size but have stated that the conditions of the test were ostensibly the same.

==Design==

The XM8 is a selective-fire 5.56mm assault rifle, firing from a closed rotary bolt. Its design and functioning is similar to that of the Heckler &amp; Koch G36 assault rifle, of which it is a derivative.

===Materials and weight===
The materials used to build the XM8 are almost entirely composites, with the notable exception of the cold-hammer-forged steel barrel. Preliminary tests in desert and arctic conditions have shown the XM8 to be a rugged weapon, though some complaints arose concerning an unspecified mechanical issue and melting handguards due to overheating when firing full-auto.

Much of the expected cost and weight savings are from the weapon&#x27;s electronic sight. The baseline XM8 carbine (with its integrated sight), for example, can be compared to an M4 carbine with a host of previous-generation electronic add-ons like the AN/PEQ-2, Aimpoint CompM2, Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight, and/or BUIS. Without the advantage of the next-generation combined electronics sight, the XM8 would be both heavier and more expensive than the firearms it was intended to replace.

===Accessories===
The XM8 abandoned the standard Picatinny rail for attachment of weapon accessories, in favor of a new standard referred to as PCAP (Picatinny Combat Attachment Points), small oval holes on the forward grip. (A variant was designed with MIL-STD-1913 rails — XM8 R; and some early XM8 prototypes had rails.) PCAP is not backwards compatible with currently fielded attachments that use MIL-STD-1913 rails without using an adapter. The benefit of PCAP, however, is the precision of the accessory&#x27;s connection with the body of the weapon; accessories utilizing Picatinny rails often need adjustment if they are removed and reattached. Additionally, most standard accessory functionality is built into the XM8. Where functionality was missing, it was anticipated that accessories would be redesigned to utilize PCAP. In the new OICW Increment One competition, the army has left the choice of attachment technology up to the manufacturer, with requirements built into the RFP as to the ability of sights to maintain their zero.

The M4 carbine barrel is and the XM8 barrel is but the rifles have the same overall length. Although a shorter barrel generally results in lower muzzle velocity, Polygonal rifling partially compensates for the loss of velocity from a shorter barrel. An electronic round counter was proposed for the XM8. The system would have tracked the number of rounds fired and the date and time of each shot. The data would then be accessed wirelessly by a device like a PDA. Another benefit would be to monitor unauthorized weapon use or corroborate field reports. Other features included completely ambidextrous controls and an integrated red dot/3x optical zoom scope (later changed to a red dot/1x sight). However the designated marksman configuration used a 3.5x magnification scope.

==Variants==

For much of its life, four different models were proposed: a compact PDW (personal defense weapon) with a barrel, a carbine with a barrel, a sniper and automatic rifle variant, both with barrels. In addition a Light machine gun with a 100-round dual drum Beta C-Mag is proposed. Accessories such as optical sights, a grenade launcher, and a bipod were integrated using a new system which allows for precision attachment (so that, for example, scopes do not have to be readjusted each time they are attached). Like the M4 and M16, the XM8 was chambered for the standard 5.56×45mm NATO round and was normally equipped with a 30-round plastic box magazine also used in the G36. Although, this meant that the magazine housing was not compatible with M4 and M16&#x27;s metal STANAG magazine without using an adaptor. A 100-round dual drum Beta C-Mag style magazine could also be used.

One of the XM8&#x27;s unique features was its modularity. In addition to attachments mentioned above, this modularity allowed for quick repairs, barrel length changes, and even caliber changes in the field. Along with its basic components, the XM8 would have complemented the XM29, with such features as identical accessory mounts.

The number and type of variants in the family varied over its lifetime, this overview with three main versions is based from a press release in the early 2000s.

*XM8 compact carbine: barrel, PDW configuration, collapsing stock or buttcap; muzzle velocity 
*XM8 carbine with XM320 grenade launcher: barrel; muzzle velocity 
*Automatic rifle: barrel, with muzzle velocity 
*Designated marksman rifle: barrel, integrated folding bipod, 4X sight, 30/100-round magazine; with muzzle velocity 
*Light machine gun: heavy barrel with integrated folding bipod, rate of fire from 600-750 rounds/min

==Usage==
While the XM8 fell out of favor with the U.S. Armed Forces, Heckler &amp; Koch sought to market the rifle globally. In the meantime, the Malaysian Armed Forces expressed interest in using the rifle and by 2007 openly stated its intention to purchase the XM8 rifle. By 2010, the Royal Malaysian Navy special unit PASKAL began using the XM8 along with other Heckler &amp; Koch assault rifles including the HK416 and G36.

<doc id="619644" wikidata="Q930905" url="?curid=619644" title="Joe Johnson (snooker player)">
<text>Joe Johnson (born 29 July 1952) is an English former professional snooker player and snooker commentator for Eurosport. He became the British under-19 champion in 1971 as an amateur, defeating Tony Knowles in the final. After reaching the finals of the 1978 English Amateur Championship and the 1978 World Amateur Championship, Johnson turned professional in 1979. He reached his first ranking final at the 1983 Professional Players Tournament, which he lost to Tony Knowles, and reached the semi-finals of the 1985 Classic. 

Johnson began the 1986 World Snooker Championship as a 150–1 outsider, with first-round losses in both of his previous Crucible appearances. He defeated Griffiths 13–12 in the quarter-finals, Knowles 16–8 in the semi-finals, and Steve Davis 18–12 in the final to win the world title and the only ranking title of his career. The following year, in the World Championship, Johnson defeated Stephen Hendry 13–12 in the quarter-finals and Neal Foulds 16–9 in the semi-finals. In the final, however, he lost 14–18 to Davis. Johnson won only one match in the final stages of the World Championship thereafter, defeating Cliff Wilson in the first round of the 1988 event.

His best performances in the other Triple Crown events were reaching the semi-finals of the 1987 UK Championship (losing 4–9 to Jimmy White) and the semi-finals of the 1988 Masters (losing 3–6 to Davis). Johnson dropped out of the top 16 after the 1989–90 snooker season and made his last Crucible appearance in 1991, losing in the first round to Dennis Taylor. He continued playing on the professional tour until 2005, when he retired at age 53 after breaking his ankle. Johnson later competed on the World Seniors Tour and won the 2019 Seniors Masters.

== Early life and amateur career ==
Johnson was born on 29 July 1952, in Bradford, England. His mother&#x27;s name was Margaret, and his father was engineer Malik Farooq. The couple separated when Joe was two years old. Margaret later married Ken Johnson, who taught his stepson how to play snooker from the age of four. Johnson became the national under-19 champion in 1971 and was three-times Yorkshire champion.

He set a record in 1978 for the highest compiled by an amateur player, recording a 140 break at the TUC Club in Middlesbrough. The same year, after finishing second to Terry Griffiths in the English Amateur Championship, Johnson represented England at the World Amateur Snooker Championship in Malta. He reached the final, where he was defeated 11–5 by Cliff Wilson; they were level at five each after the first , but Wilson won six consecutive frames for the victory. Johnson made the highest break of the tournament, a 101.

In 1979, he was accepted as a professional snooker player by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association along with Wilson, Tony Meo and Mike Hallett. Before taking up snooker professionally, Johnson worked as an apprentice motor mechanic and as a gasfitter.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Johnson achieved little success in his early professional career and gained a reputation for not performing well in televised matches. At the 1979 Canadian Open, he defeated Steve Baruda 5–4 after making a 100 break in the first frame. He eliminated John Bear 9–7 in the next round but then lost 2–9 to Kirk Stevens in the last 16. Johnson won the billiards competition that was running alongside the snooker event, defeating Ian Williamson 500–284 in the final.

At the 1980 World Championship, he eliminated Roy Andrewartha 9–5 in the first qualifying round but lost his next match 6–9 to Pat Houlihan. At the 1981 World Championship, he took a 4–3 lead against Tony Meo after the first session but lost in the .

In the 1981–82 season, Johnson progressed through several rounds of the 1981 Jameson International. After defeating Jim Donnelly 5–4 and Murdo MacLeod 5–1, he received a walkover against John Pulman. He next eliminated Jim Wych 5–2, which was the most significant win of Johnson&#x27;s professional career up to that point, but he then lost in the last-24 round to Graham Miles, 3–5.

He began the 1981 UK Championship with a 9–1 win over Tommy Murphy, followed by a 9–3 defeat of Mike Watterson and a 9–4 win over Cliff Wilson. In the next round, he eliminated the former world champion John Spencer 9–5, earning himself a last-16 tie against another former world champion, Ray Reardon, to whom he lost 7–9. Johnson defeated Vic Harris 9–4 in the qualifying rounds of the 1982 World Championship and reached the last 48, where he lost 8–9 to Mike Hallett.

===1982–1985: Ranking event finalist===
After receiving a walkover against John Phillips, Johnson faced Cliff Wilson in the qualifying competition for the 1982 Jameson International. After taking a 4–2 lead, he lost 4–5. Johnson won his first ranking points at the 1982 Professional Players Tournament. He began with a 5–1 win against Graham Miles, followed by a 5–1 win against sixth-ranked Kirk Stevens and a 5–4 last-16 win against Mark Wildman. In the quarter-final, Johnson won the first frame against John Virgo but was defeated 1–5. As one of six players outside the top eight in the rankings who progressed furthest in the tournament, he was awarded a place at the 1983 Masters. Johnson lost his opening match at the Masters to Cliff Thorburn. In the qualifying event for the 1983 World Championship, recorded a 10–0 against Paul Watchorn in the first round but lost 8–9 to Wilson and failed to reach the main event.

Johnson&#x27;s points from the previous season saw him ranked 23rd in the world. In the last 48 of the 1983 International Open, he beat Dennis Hughes 5–1 and lost 2–5 to Eddie Charlton in the last 32. Johnson began the untelevised 1983 Professional Players Tournament with a 5–3 win against Pascal Burke. Then he defeated Jimmy White 5–3. In his next match, against Charlton, Johnson won 5–0. In the quarter-final, Johnson eliminated Thorburn 5–1 and defeated Tony Meo 9–6 in the semi-finals to reach his first major final, against Tony Knowles. After being 1–6 down to Knowles, Johnson compiled the highest break of the tournament (135) and levelled the match at 8–8 before Knowles secured the deciding frame.

At the 1983 UK Championship, Johnson reached the quarter-finals by eliminating Matt Gibson and Virgo (both by 9–6) and David Taylor 9–3. The quarter-final against Terry Griffiths was his first televised match as a professional. Johnson lost the first seven frames and the match, 2–9. In the qualifying event for the 1984 World Championship, he won his encounter with Gibson 10–3 to earn his debut on the Crucible stage (where he was defeated 1–10 by Dennis Taylor).

Johnson began the 1984–85 season ranked 19th. At the 1984 Costa Del Sol Classic, he started with a quarter-final win against Mick Fisher and lost 2–3 in the semi-final to Dennis Taylor. Johnson lost to Taylor again at the 1984 International Open. He eliminated Mario Morra 5–0 and Charlton 5–1 in the last 32 before losing to Taylor 2–5 in the last 16. In the following ranking event, the 1984 Grand Prix, Johnson defeated Paul Medati 5–1 but lost 4–5 to Ian Williamson in the last 32. At the 1984 UK Championship, he defeated John Rea 9–6 and John Spencer by the same score in the last 32 before a 2–0 defeat by Stevens in the last 16. Johnson defeated Ray Edmonds and Knowles to reach the last 16 at the 1985 Mercantile Credit Classic. He then whitewashed Wilson and achieved his first win in a televised match, winning each frame by a narrow margin. A 5–3 victory against Warren King took him into the semi-finals. According to Janice Hale of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Johnson &quot;failed to reproduce any of the fighting form which he displayed in the final of last season&#x27;s Professional Players Tournament&quot; as he lost 2–9 to Thorburn.

He qualified for the main stage of the 1985 World Snooker Championship again by defeating Geoff Foulds 10–6. Johnson played Bill Werbeniuk (who had not won a match all season) in the first round, but Werbeniuk made a 143 break in the tenth frame – the third-highest break ever recorded at the championship at that time – and won 10–8.

===1985–86 season: World champion===

Johnson began the season ranked 16th, inside the top 16 for the first time in his career. He was relatively unheralded going into the 1986 World Championship, since he had never won a televised match until the previous year. Having never won a match at the Crucible Theatre, Johnson was rated a 150–1 outsider. His best results during the season had been quarter-final finishes at the 1985 Matchroom Trophy (where he lost 3–5 to Neal Foulds) and at the 1986 Mercantile Credit Classic (where he lost 4–5 to Cliff Thorburn).

He defeated Dave Martin 10–3 in the first round for his first win in three main-stage World Championship appearances. In the second round, Johnson took a 5–3 lead against Mike Hallett after the first session and went on to win 13–6. He met former champion Terry Griffiths in the quarter-finals. Johnson led 9–7 going into the final session, but Griffiths won five straight frames to lead 12–9 before Johnson won four straight frames (including two century breaks) to win 13–12. He eliminated Tony Knowles despite taking painkillers for a cyst on his back before the start of play, winning the last two frames of the final session for a 16–8 victory.

In the final, Johnson met world number one Steve Davis; they had never previously played a professional match against one another. Davis was considered much more likely to win the final, reflected in the bookmakers&#x27; odds of 2–9 for Davis and 5–1 for Johnson. Davis took a 3–1 lead, making breaks of 108 and 107. Johnson then took the next three frames to finish the first session 4–3 ahead. Davis began the second session by winning four frames in succession to put himself 7–4 ahead. After the next mid-session interval, Johnson won four consecutive frames, before Davis clinched the last frame to leave the match level at 8–8 overnight.

On the second day, Johnson wore an unusual pair of red, pink and white leather shoes. Resuming the match, he won another run of four frames to take a 12–8 lead. Gordon Burn wrote in his book &quot;Pocket Money&quot; (1986), &quot;From the beginning of the third session he played an open game full of flair and daring and the length-of-the-table, long-potting which had been so characteristic of Steve Davis in the days when he was still making his name.&quot; The session ended with Johnson ahead 13–11. In the final session the crowd appeared to favour Johnson, who had played with an attacking style throughout the tournament. He won three of the next four frames to lead 16–12 before the mid-session interval. He then added frame 29 and compiled a break of 64 in frame 30 to win the match 18–12. The win helped lift Johnson from 16th place in the 1985–86 professional rankings to eighth for 1986–87.

He wore a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;Bradford&#x27;s Bouncing Back&quot; (a reference to the Bradford City stadium fire a year earlier) when he was not playing in the tournament. Johnson&#x27;s win led to an appearance on the television show &quot;Wogan&quot; and a &quot;personal appearance&quot; accompanying pop star Cliff Richard to watch Wimbledon.

===Post-World Championship win===
He had a poor season in terms of results as world champion, and lost before the televised stage in every major tournament except one before the 1987 World Championship. By his own admission, Johnson arrived at the Crucible for the tournament simply hoping merely to progress past the first round. However, he defied expectations and reached the final again. In the first round, Johnson narrowly defeated Eugene Hughes in a match that went to the last frame. He followed this with a 13–7 win against Murdo MacLeod, then defeated the 18-year-old Stephen Hendry 13–12 in the quarter-finals. In the semi-final, Johnson won 16–9 against Neal Foulds. Once again his opponent in the final was Steve Davis.

Johnson took a 4–3 lead in the first session but was 7–9 behind after session two. Davis increased his advantage to 14–9, but Johnson took the last frame of the third session and the first three frames of the concluding session to be one frame behind at 13–14. After Johnson had a bad miss attempting a long pot early in frame 28, Davis took that frame and the next two for an 18–14 victory. Davis said, &quot;For Joe to come to the Crucible and play as if he hadn&#x27;t had the season he has was tremendous, really.&quot; Johnson praised Davis, as he had after the 1986 final, and said about his own year as champion: &quot;It only seemed five minutes when I walked out to play Steve again in the final, but with all the personal appearances it just seemed to go on and on.&quot;

He reached fifth place in the world 1987–88 rankings based on results from the two preceding seasons, largely as a result of his performances at the Crucible. Johnson was runner-up to Dennis Taylor in the four-player 1987 Carling Challenge, and he won the 1987 Scottish Masters by overcoming Terry Griffiths 9–7 in the final for his only other major professional snooker title. He reached the semi-finals of the 1987 UK Championship, where he came close to making a 147 maximum break against Jimmy White but missed the pink on 134 and lost the match 4–9. Later that season Johnson reached the semi-finals of the 1988 Masters, where he lost 3–6 to Davis after eliminating Willie Thorne and White. He defeated Cliff Wilson 10–7 in the first round of the 1988 World Championship, and recovered from 3–11 to 9–11 against Steve James before losing after James won the next two frames.

Dropping six places to 11th in the 1988–89 season, Johnson&#x27;s best showing in a ranking tournament was reaching the quarter-finals of the 1988 Fidelity International Open. He lost 5–10 to Tony Meo in the first round of the 1989 World Championship. In 1989–90, Johnson was runner-up to Thorne in the invitational 1989 New Zealand Masters. His best ranking-tournament performance was at the 1989 Rothmans Grand Prix, where he whitewashed White in a run to the quarter-finals. Johnson won the invitational 1989 Norwich Union Grand Prix by defeating Hendry 5–3 in the final, but lost 8–10 to Darren Morgan in the opening round of the 1990 World Championship.

===Later career===
Johnson began the 1990–91 season ranked 18th, outside the top 16 for the first time in five years. He failed to progress as far as the quarter-finals in any ranking event that season. Johnson won the 1991 Nescafe Extra Challenge, a four-player round-robin event, with victories in all three of his matches, against Tony Drago, James Wattana and Alain Robidoux. He qualified for his last appearance at the Crucible, the 1991 World Championship, where he lost 6–10 to Dennis Taylor in the first round. Despite having heart and eye problems during the 1990s, Johnson continued to play. Following his first heart attack, in 1991, Johnson received medical advice to retire as the pressure of competitive matches could increase the likelihood of another heart attack.

He reached the quarter-finals of the 1991 Grand Prix after defeating Warren King in the last 64, Tony Jones in the last 32 and Mike Hallett in the last 16 to set up the quarter-final against Nigel Bond, where he lost 3–5. Johnson was runner-up to Stephen Hendry in the invitational 1992 European Challenge, and he narrowly missed qualifying for the 1992 World Championship after losing 9–10 to Mick Price on the in the deciding frame.

Needing to win one match to qualify for the 1993 World Championship, Johnson lost 6–10 to Karl Payne in the last 48. He won only one qualifying match at the World Championship in his next five attempts, a 10–5 victory against Matthew Couch in 1995 . Johnson did not reach the last 48 of the World Championship again after 1993, although he won three matches in 2003. He broke his ankle in a fall at home before the start of the 2003–04 season and did not compete in any events until the World Championship qualifying in February 2004. Johnson conceded, 0–9 behind, to Ian Preece in their best-of-19-frames match. He played his last match as a professional later that month in the qualifying rounds of the 2004 Players Championship, where he lost 3–5 to Stuart Mann. Johnson retired in 2005, aged 53, as the oldest player on the professional snooker circuit at the time.

==Seniors events==
He won the Seniors Pot Black Trophy in 1997. Johnson played in the 2000 World Seniors Masters, a one-frame-format event, and lost in the first round to the eventual champion Willie Thorne. He promoted the revival of the World Seniors Championship in 2010, and lost 0–2 to Steve Davis in his opening match. Johnson won the April 2019 World Seniors Masters, with all three of his matches determined on a used as a tiebreaker in the event of each player winning one of two frames. He lost 0–3 to Adrian Ridley in the first round of the 2023 World Seniors Championship and 1–3 to Barry Pinches at the same stage of the 2024 edition.

==Legacy==
In his 2012 book &quot;Black Farce and Cue Ball Wizards&quot;, Clive Everton wrote that in 1986 Johnson &quot;produced an unstoppable urge of inspiration&quot; but &quot;never sustained such form before and never sustained it again&quot;. Johnson found it difficult to deal with the pressures of World Championship fame. Snooker journalist Hector Nunns wrote in 2017 that Johnson would always be remembered for &quot;his shot-making, his shoes, his extra-curricular singing, and his sheer &quot;joie de vivre&quot; in the match that defined his career&quot;. In their 2005 book about snooker world champions, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby wrote: &quot;His attacking style and ability to crash in long pots [...] prefigured the tactical approach that would dominate snooker from the 1990s into the new millennium.&quot;

==Other activities==
Johnson was the subject of &quot;This is Your Life&quot;, and he was a guest on the celebrity sports quiz &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; in 1986. In April 1987, BBC1 broadcast a 30-minute profile of Johnson, &quot;An Ordinary Joe&quot;, which focused on the year since his World Championship victory. He made several appearances on the snooker-themed game show &quot;Big Break&quot; between 1991 and 2001. Johnson was interviewed for an episode of the BBC Radio 5 Live show &quot;Time of My Life&quot; in 1998 and was a guest on the TV quiz show &quot;Celebrity Eggheads&quot; in 2012.

He sang in the Preston-based band Made in Japan, who released a cover of &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; in October 1986. Johnson coached Shaun Murphy, and he was an early influence on Paul Hunter. He is a regular commentator for Eurosport. In December 2013, John Higgins said of Johnson: &quot;I heard before the 2013 UK Championship Joe Johnson was slating me. If that guy isn&#x27;t the worst commentator in the world, he&#x27;s in the top three.&quot;

Johnson and his business partner Dave Shipley bought three snooker clubs, and Johnson managed coaching academies. He is married to Terryl and has seven children. By 2017, he had survived seven heart attacks.

<text>Juan Miguel Aguilera (born in Valencia in 1960) is a Spanish science fiction author.

He was first trained as an industrial designer. As an author, he has received the Ignotus prize, the Alberto Magno prize, and the Juli Verne prize.

His first works were written in collaboration with Javier Redal. These are histories influenced by hard science fiction, set in the universe of &quot;Akasa-Puspa&quot;, although the time gaps between them make the similarities harder to find. These worlds are created with great consistency and attention to detail. &quot;Mundos en el Abismo&quot; (&quot;Worlds in the Abyss&quot;) and its sequel &quot;Hijos de la Eternidad&quot; (&quot;Children of Eternity&quot;) combine a plot typical of space opera with elements of hard science fiction.

&quot;El Refugio&quot; (&quot;The Refuge&quot;) shows a deep scientific influence: biotechnology, biochemistry, communication between species, evolution.

Aguilera has also collaborated with Ricardo Lázaro and Rafael Marín.

In his solo work, he spends less time on scientific detail and incorporates elements of fantasy, in a genre he calls &quot;speculative history.&quot; As a scriptwriter, he has worked on the film &quot;&quot;. He has been the illustrator for a number of science fiction book covers.

<doc id="619655" wikidata="Q517589" url="?curid=619655" title="Richard Goldstone">
<text>Richard Joseph Goldstone (born 26 October 1938) is a South African retired judge who served in the Constitutional Court of South Africa from July 1994 to October 2003. He joined the bench as a judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa, first in the Transvaal Provincial Division from 1980 to 1989 and then in the Appellate Division from 1990 to 1994. Before that, he was a commercial lawyer in Johannesburg, where he entered legal practice in 1963 and took silk in 1976.

He is considered to be one of several liberal judges who issued key rulings that undermined apartheid from within the system by tempering the worst effects of the country&#x27;s racial laws. Among other important rulings, Goldstone made the Group Areas Act – under which non-whites were banned from living in &quot;whites only&quot; areas – virtually unworkable by restricting evictions. As a result, prosecutions under the act virtually ceased.

During the transition from apartheid to multiracial democracy in the early 1990s, he headed the influential Goldstone Commission investigations into political violence in South Africa between 1991 and 1994. Goldstone&#x27;s work enabled multi-party negotiations to remain on course despite repeated outbreaks of violence, and his willingness to criticise all sides led to him being dubbed &quot;perhaps the most trusted man, certainly the most trusted member of the white establishment&quot; in South Africa. He was credited with playing an indispensable role in the transition and became a well known public figure in South Africa, attracting widespread international support and interest.

Goldstone&#x27;s work investigating violence led directly to his being nominated to serve as the first chief prosecutor of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda from August 1994 to September 1996. He prosecuted a number of key war crimes suspects, notably the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. On his return to South Africa he took up a seat on the newly established Constitutional Court of South Africa, to which he had been nominated by President Nelson Mandela. 

In 2009, Goldstone led a fact-finding mission created by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate international human rights and humanitarian law violations related to the Gaza War. The mission concluded that Israel and Hamas had both potentially committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, findings which sparked outrage in Israel and the initiation of a personal campaign against Goldstone. In 2011, in the light of investigations by the Israeli forces which indicated that they had not intentionally targeted civilians as a matter of policy, Goldstone wrote that if evidence which had been available later had been available at the time, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document.

==Early life and education==

Goldstone was born on 26 October 1938 in Boksburg near Johannesburg in South Africa&#x27;s Transvaal Province. His parents were second-generation immigrants: his maternal grandfather was English and his paternal grandfather was a Lithuanian Jew who emigrated in the 19th century. He was educated at the King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and read law at the University of the Witwatersrand, graduating in 1962 with a BA LLB &quot;cum laude&quot;. He later recalled: &quot;My grandfather decided when I was about four [that] I was going to be a barrister, so I just always assumed I was. It turned out to be a wise decision.&quot; At university, he became involved in anti-apartheid activism, inspired partly by his parents&#x27; opposition to racial discrimination. As chairman of the university&#x27;s student representative council and president of the National Union of South African Students, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with banned anti-apartheid groups, including the African National Congress.

==Early legal career==

After his graduation, Goldstone was admitted to the Johannesburg Bar in 1963. He practised corporate and intellectual property law as a barrister in Johannesburg for 17 years, establishing a practice that was &quot;100 percent commercial&quot;. He was appointed as Senior Counsel in 1976.

== Supreme Court of South Africa: 1980–1994 ==
In 1980, Goldstone was appointed as a judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. At the time of his appointment he was the youngest Supreme Court judge in the country. He served in the Supreme Court for 14 years, gaining promotion to the Appellate Division in 1989. 

=== Jurisprudence ===
Goldstone later said that his nomination to the bench created a &quot;moral dilemma&quot;, insofar as South African judges were expected to uphold apartheid legislation, but that, &quot;the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all&quot;. On these grounds, he was apparently urged by several anti-apartheid lawyers to accept the appointment.

He noted in 1992 that most South African judges &quot;applied such [apartheid] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude.&quot; A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that &quot;in my view, if a judge is to err, it should be on the side of defending morality.&quot; He took the view that &quot;judges have a duty to act morally, and if they&#x27;re dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it&#x27;s their duty – if they can, within the powers they&#x27;ve got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust.&quot; Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; &quot;I hated in the morning the thought of having to do this for another day, [but] by the end of the day, I was exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was.&quot;

Goldstone&#x27;s career as a judge was characterised by bold acts of judicial activism that soon attracted national and international interest. He was described as &quot;an outstanding commercial lawyer who had shrewdly and inventively applied the law to secure justice in politically controversial and human rights cases.&quot; Employing the bench as a means of making ordinary South Africans aware of the iniquities of apartheid, he gained a reputation as a committed, compassionate, legally meticulous and politically astute jurist who championed international human rights and sought to temper the effects of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid laws. He sought to retain his independence, refusing to kowtow to the authorities. As Reinhard Zimmermann puts it, Goldstone &quot;emerged as one of the leading &#x27;liberal&#x27; judges who never showed any propensity towards the then prevailing executive-mindedness&quot;.

His judicial approach was influenced by the fact that although the ruling National Party had built up a framework of racist and unequal laws aimed at repressing the rights of non-whites, the country had retained the underlying structure and principles of Anglo-Dutch common law. According to Davis &amp; Le Roux (2009), a group of liberal judges that included Goldstone, Gerald Friedman, Ray Leon, Johann Kriegler, John Milne and Lourens Ackermann sought to read the apartheid legislation &quot;as narrowly as possible to give effect to the values of the common law&quot;.

This philosophy led Goldstone to issue rulings that undermined key aspects of the apartheid system. One of his most significant rulings concerned the Group Areas Act that mandated the eviction of non-whites from areas reserved for whites. His ruling in the case of &quot;S v Govender&quot; in 1982 that evictions of non-whites were not automatically required by the Act led to the virtual cessation of such evictions. Following the judgement it became so difficult to evict non-whites from whites-only areas that the system of housing segregation began to break down. Prosecutions under the Act fell from 893 between 1978–1981 to only one in 1983. Geoffrey Budlender, former director of the anti-apartheid Legal Resources Centre, commented of Goldstone&#x27;s decision in the &quot;Govender&quot; case that &quot;it was an alert judge trying to apply human rights standards to a repressive piece of legislation. And it was Goldstone&#x27;s work; it wasn&#x27;t our work that stopped the Group Areas prosecutions in the end.&quot; Budlender noted that &quot;it was a matter of great debate in the eighties about whether decent people should accept appointments to the bench, because they were enforcing repressive laws,&quot; but stated that &quot;[f]rom the point of view of the practitioner trying to run human rights cases and public-interest cases, we prayed for a Goldstone or a [John] Didcott on the bench. That was our dream.&quot;

In 1985, Goldstone ruled that the government&#x27;s mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The following year, he was the first judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.

Some of South Africa&#x27;s laws and emergency regulations mandated particular penalties which judges had no discretion to modify. South Africa&#x27;s whites-only parliament pursued a doctrine of parliamentary supremacy, passing laws which judges were absolutely bound to enforce if they had been enacted by parliament or were faithful to what parliament had done. Goldstone distressed civil rights lawyers in 1986 when he concurred without comment with a decision that allowed the jailing of a 13-year-old boy for disrupting school. Goldstone later remarked that he was constrained by the law, that &quot;the emergency regulations covered the situation.&quot; The laws and regulations also included the death penalty for certain crimes such as murders committed without any extenuating circumstances; although Goldstone was personally opposed to the death penalty, he was nonetheless required to pass death sentences on two convicted murderers. His reluctance to impose death penalties prompted criticism from judges who were in favour of capital punishment. Another Transvaal Supreme Court judge, D. Curlewis, commented in 1991 that &quot;a person who deserves to hang was more likely to get the death sentence from me or my ilk&quot; than Goldstone or other liberal judges, who were &quot;at heart abolitionists for one reason or another... Obviously, and for that reason, they cannot be sound on the imposition of the death penalty.&quot;
During his career as judge, Goldstone sentenced to death 2 black South Africans and was involved in upholding the death sentences of over 20 other black South Africans.

Albie Sachs, who was later to serve alongside Goldstone on the Constitutional Court of South Africa, commented that Goldstone&#x27;s judicial career demonstrated &quot;that an honest and dignified judge who&#x27;s sensitive to fundamental human rights of all human beings, even in the most dire circumstances, could find some space for concepts of legality and respect for human dignity.&quot;

=== Sebokeng Inquiry and Goldstone Commission ===

In 1990, President F. W. de Klerk began the negotiation process that was to lead to the end of apartheid in 1994. At the time, South Africa was plagued by regular massacres as members of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) fought for dominance. The police and security forces often reacted to demonstrations with indiscriminate force, and the ANC claimed that a hypothesised &quot;Third Force&quot; was engaged in covert destabilisation. The violence caused serious problems in building trust between the parties.

The negotiations broke down soon after they started due to a mass shooting at Sebokeng township near Johannesburg in March 1990, in which 281 demonstrators were shot and 11 killed by South African police. After pressure from the ANC, de Klerk appointed Goldstone to investigate the incident. His report was published in September 1990 and was described at the time as &quot;one of the strongest indictments of South Africa&#x27;s police ever made by a government-appointed investigator.&quot; He condemned the police for a breakdown in discipline and recommended that a number of individual police officers be prosecuted. Nine policemen were subsequently charged with murder.

To aid the transition to multiracial democracy, the South African government established a Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation in October 1991 to investigate human rights abuses committed by the country&#x27;s various political factions. Its members were chosen by consensus among the three main parties. Goldstone had by now become reputed as an impartial and unimpeachable judge, and was asked by ANC chairman Nelson Mandela to head the commission; it became known as the Goldstone Commission. Goldstone explained later that he had been selected because he had earned the confidence of both sides: &quot;The government was aware that I would not make findings against it without good cause, and the majority of South Africans had confidence that I would quote hesitate to make findings against the government if the evidence justified it.&quot; He nonetheless received numerous death threats. He continued to work as an appeals court judge throughout his time chairing the commission, hearing cases during the mornings and afternoons and then continuing through to midnight on Commission business.

The Commission sat for three years, carrying out 503 investigations that triggered the initiation of 16 prosecutions. It had no judicial powers and could not issue binding regulations but had to establish its legitimacy through its reports and recommendations. It soon gained a reputation for even handedness, criticising all sides in often trenchant terms. The rivalry between the ANC and IFP was blamed for being &quot;the primary cause&quot; of violence and Goldstone urged both sides to &quot;abandon violence and intimidation as political weapons&quot;. The government&#x27;s security forces were found to have been involved in numerous abuses of human rights, though Goldstone rejected Nelson Mandela&#x27;s claims that President de Klerk was personally involved and described such suggestions as &quot;unwise, unfair and dangerous&quot;. One of Goldstone&#x27;s most important findings was the revelation in November 1992 that a secret military intelligence unit of the South African Defence Force was working to sabotage the ANC while posing as a legitimate business corporation. The ensuing scandal led to De Klerk purging the army and intelligence services.

Goldstone&#x27;s findings attracted praise and criticism from all sides. Some anti-apartheid activists criticised Goldstone for what they saw as balancing his reports by apportioning blame equally; Goldstone responded that his findings reflected the fact that all sides had &quot;dirty hands&quot;. Nonetheless, his impartiality and willingness to speak out led to him becoming, as the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; put it in 1993, &quot;arguably the most indispensable arbitrator in South Africa&#x27;s turbulent transition to democracy.&quot; He became a household name and was voted the top newsmaker of 1992 in a South African poll, well ahead of either de Klerk or Mandela. His character was cited by other lawyers as a key asset in making the commission a success; one lawyer commented, &quot;He has the rare ability to straddle both the legal and political worlds. He is a great strategist and combines a deep humanity with a political sensitivity.&quot;

As well as reporting on political violence, Goldstone proposed practical measures to end the violence in venues such as commuter trains, taxis, mines, township hostels and the troubled Natal region. He also succeeded in persuading the government to accept an international rôle in the transition – which it had previously strongly opposed – as well as forcing it to undertake a major restructuring of the security forces and purging subversive elements in the military. According to Goldstone, the commission&#x27;s work helped to calm South Africa during the transition period. He regarded it as &quot;a vitally important safety valve&quot; that provided a &quot;credible public instrument&quot; to deal with incidents that might otherwise have derailed the negotiations. The international community took a similar view; his work was supported and funded by the UN, the Commonwealth and the European Community, who regarded it as vital to expose the truth behind political violence in order to achieve democratic stability.

Goldstone&#x27;s work was to pave the way for the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1995, a body that he strongly supported. Its chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commented that Goldstone had made an &quot;indispensable&quot; contribution to the peaceful democratic transition in South Africa. The commission&#x27;s final report was strongly critical of the apartheid-era legal system but commended the role of a few judges, including Goldstone, who &quot;exercised their judicial discretion in favour of justice and liberty wherever proper and possible&quot;. It noted that although they were few in number, such figures were &quot;influential enough to be part of the reason why the ideal of a constitutional democracy as the favoured form of government for a future South Africa continued to burn brightly throughout the darkness of the apartheid era.&quot; The Commission found that &quot;the alleviation of suffering achieved by such lawyers substantially outweighed the admitted harm done by their participation in the system.&quot; Reinhard Zimmermann commented in 1995 that &quot;Goldstone&#x27;s reputation as a sound and impeccably impartial lawyer coupled with his genuine concern for social justice have invested him, across the political spectrum, with a degree of legitimacy that is probably unequalled in South Africa today.&quot;

== Constitutional Court of South Africa: 1994–2003 ==

From July 1994 to October 2003, Goldstone was a judge in the Constitutional Court of South Africa, which was newly established under the post-apartheid Interim Constitution. Justice Albie Sachs described Goldstone as representing &quot;a sense of continuity&quot; between the traditions of the past that managed to survive the years of apartheid, and the whole new era of the constitution that governs South Africa today. Notable judgments written by Goldstone included three important decisions on unfair discrimination and the right to equality: &quot;President v Hugo&quot;, &quot;Harksen v Lane&quot;, and &quot;J v Director-General, Home Affairs.&quot;

== International service ==

===Chief UN Prosecutor in Yugoslavia and Rwanda===

In August 1994, Goldstone was named as the first chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which was established by a resolution of the UN Security Council in 1993. When the Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in late 1994, he became its chief prosecutor, too. His appointment to the tribunals came as something of a surprise, even to Goldstone himself, as he had only limited experience of international law and Yugoslavian affairs and had never been a prosecutor before. He owed his appointment to the Italian chief judge of the ICTY, Antonio Cassese. There had been lengthy wrangling between UN member states about whom to appoint as a prosecutor and none of the candidates proposed so far had been accepted. The French national counsel, Roger Errera, suggested Goldstone, commenting that &quot;if he is Jewish, that goes down well. Everyone suspects everyone in the former Yugoslavia. So it&#x27;s better that he is neither Catholic, nor Orthodox, nor Muslim.&quot;

Goldstone was approached by Cassese and expressed an interest in the position. President Mandela supported his wish to take up the position at The Hague, as Goldstone later recalled: &quot;He certainly encouraged me. He thought it was important to take what was the first offer of a major international position after South Africa ceased to be a pariah.&quot; However, the offer put Mandela in a difficult spot. He wanted Goldstone, who was one of the few South African jurists to have earned the respect of both blacks and whites, for South Africa&#x27;s newly established Constitutional Court. Mandela struck a deal with the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that Goldstone would serve only half of his four-year term as prosecutor and would then return to take up his post in South Africa. The president rushed through a constitutional amendment that would allow Goldstone to be named, take an immediate period of leave to serve at the tribunal and then return to his spot on the Constitutional Court. He proved to be an ideal candidate, as he had been suggested by the French, was not too hot-headed for the British, was strong enough to satisfy the Americans and his credentials as a white South African who had opposed apartheid satisfied the Russians and Chinese. The UN Security Council unanimously approved his appointment to the rôle of prosecutor.

In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had to design prosecutorial strategies for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch. In doing so, he sought to be scrupulously even-handed – a goal he was more easily able to achieve at ICTY than at ICTR. He built his strategy at both courts to a large degree on that pursued by the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945–46. He served as the chief prosecutor of the two tribunals until September 1996. Among his most notable legal achievements as chief prosecutor was securing the recognition of rape as a war crime under the Geneva Convention.

Goldstone was hindered by the inflexible bureaucracy of the UN, finding the newly established ICTY in a shambles when he joined the tribunal. The tribunal lacked political legitimacy, financial support and prosecutorial direction; its failure to even bring any prosecutions had led to it being criticised by the media as &quot;a fig leaf for inaction&quot;, and Goldstone was asked by the former British prime minister Edward Heath: &quot;Why did you accept such a ridiculous job?&quot; He had to make repeated appeals to the UN&#x27;s hierarchy and to donor nations for the equipment and funding that the tribunal needed to operate. He quickly found that the key to the job was to take &quot;[the] big-picture diplomatic role and [recognise] that the hands-on prosecution work could be pushed down to experienced prosecutors and investigators like [Graham] Blewitt – at least for the time being.&quot; He undertook a flurry of media appearances and financial negotiations that led to the tribunal being properly staffed for the first time, with many staff being recruited through his own personal networks; a budget of eight million dollars from thirteen countries, supplemented by a $300,000 donation from George Soros; and the first indictment, of Bosnian Serb prison camp guard Duško Tadić.

Another problem Goldstone faced was the reluctance of NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia to apprehend war crimes suspects. He was bitterly critical of what he called the &quot;highly inappropriate and pusillanimous policy&quot; of Western countries in declining to pursue suspected war criminals, singling out France and the United Kingdom as particular culprits. By the end of his time as prosecutor he had issued 74 indictments but only seven of the accused had been apprehended.

Goldstone was instrumental in preventing the Dayton Agreement of December 1995 including amnesty provisions for those accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Some commentators had advocated including an amnesty as the price for peace; Goldstone was resolutely opposed to this, not only because it would enable those responsible for atrocities to escape justice but also because of the dangerous precedent it could set, where powerful actors such as the United States could bargain away the ICTY&#x27;s mandate for political convenience. In response, Goldstone pushed through a new indictment of the Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadžić and his army chief Ratko Mladić for the Srebrenica massacre, which was issued two weeks into the peace talks at Dayton. He lobbied President Bill Clinton to resist any such demands and made it clear that an amnesty would not be a legal basis for the ICTY to suspend indictments. In the end, no amnesty was included in the Dayton Agreement. Goldstone&#x27;s actions were later credited with making the negotiations a success. The chief US negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, described the tribunal as &quot;a huge valuable tool&quot; which had enabled Karadžić and Mladić to be excluded from the talks, with the Serbian side represented instead by the more conciliatory Milosević. The Dayton Agreement put direct responsibility on all sides to send suspects to The Hague, committing the Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian governments to cooperating with the ICTY in future.

When he retired from the Office of the Prosecutor in 1996, Goldstone was replaced by the distinguished Canadian lawyer Louise Arbour. His contribution was praised by colleagues at the ICTY: &quot;Goldstone was absolutely right for his time because he came with moral clout from South Africa and his own particular status as a champion of human rights.&quot;

===Argentina===
He was a member of the International Panel of the Commission of Enquiry into the Activities of Nazism in Argentina (CEANA) which was established in 1997 to identify Nazi war criminals who had emigrated to Argentina, and transferred victim assets (Nazi gold) there.

===Kosovo===
Goldstone was chair of the Independent International Commission on Kosovo from August 1999 until December 2001.

===Volcker Committee===
In April 2004, he was appointed by Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General, to the Independent Inquiry Committee, chaired by Paul Volcker, to investigate the Iraq Oil for Food program.

===The Goldstone Report===

During the Gaza War between Israel and Hamas in December 2008 – January 2009, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) passed a resolution condemning Israel for &quot;grave violations&quot; of human rights and calling for an independent international investigation. The UNHRC appointed a four-person team, headed by Goldstone, to investigate &quot;all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.&quot;

According to a Reuters report Goldstone said he had spent many days and &quot;sleepless nights&quot; deciding whether to accept the mandate, saying that it had come as &quot;quite a shock&quot;. He continued, &quot;I can approach the daunting task I have accepted in an even-handed and impartial manner and give it the same attention that I have to situations in my own country,&quot; where his experience had been that &quot;transparent, public investigations are very important, important particularly for the victims because it brings acknowledgement of what happened to them.&quot; He explained that he had long &quot;taken a deep interest in Israel, in what happens in Israel, and I have been associated with organisations that have worked in Israel&quot; and &quot;decided to accept it because of my deep concern for peace in the Middle East, and my deep concern for victims in all sides in the Middle East.&quot;

Goldstone insisted that he would not follow a one-sided mandate but would investigate any abuses committed by either side during the conflict. He said that he had initially not been willing to take on the mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi&#x27;s verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.

The Israeli government refused to cooperate with the investigation, accusing the UN Human Rights Council of anti-Israel bias and arguing that the report could not possibly be fair.

In a 20 January 2011 panel discussion at Stanford University, Goldstone said that the UNHRC &quot;repeatedly rush to pass condemnatory resolutions in the face of alleged violations of human rights law by Israel but ... have failed to take similar action in the face of even more serious violations by other States. Until the Gaza Report they failed to condemn the firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian centers.&quot;

The report, released on 15 September 2009, concluded that both sides had committed violations of the laws of war. It stated that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure. Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups were found to have deliberately targeted Israeli civilians and sought to spread terror in southern Israel by mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks. The report&#x27;s conclusions were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.

On 16 October 2009, UN Human Rights Council voted in support of the Goldstone Report where twenty-five member nations voted in favour of the resolution endorsing the report, six voted against endorsement while another eleven remained impartial. Goldstone has criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council&#x27;s selective endorsement of the report his commission compiled, since the resolution adopted chastises Israel only, when the report itself is critical of both parties.

The Israeli government and some Jewish groups strongly criticised the report, which they asserted was biased and commissioned by a UN body that was hostile to Israel. Hamas also dismissed the findings that it had committed war crimes. Goldstone himself came under sustained personal attack, with critics accusing him of bias, dishonesty and improper motives in being party to the report. Goldstone denied the accusations, saying he felt that being a Jew increased his obligation to participate in the investigation.

In a 1 April 2011 article in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reflecting on the commission&#x27;s work, Goldstone wrote that the report would have been different if he had been aware of information that had become known since its issuance. While expressing regret that Israel&#x27;s failure to co-operate with the commission had hindered its ability to gather exculpatory facts, he approved Israel&#x27;s subsequent internal investigations into incidents described in the report as well as their establishment of policies to better protect civilians in future conflicts. He contrasted the Israeli reaction with the failure of Hamas to investigate or modify their methods and procedures. Goldstone said he had hoped that the commission&#x27;s inquiry &quot;would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted&quot;. In addition, according to a report in Haaretz, Goldstone told associates in early 2011 that &quot;he has been in great distress and under duress&quot; ever since publication of his report.

==Academic and charity activities==
Goldstone served as the founding national president of the National Institute of Crime Prevention and the Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO), a body established to look after prisoners who had been released; chairperson of the Bradlow Foundation, a charitable educational trust; and head of the board of the Human Rights Institute of South Africa (HURISA). In March 1996, Goldstone was named chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He served for two terms, stepping down in September 2006. In October 2003, Goldstone gave a lecture entitled &quot;Preventing Deadly Conflict&quot; at the University of San Diego&#x27;s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice Distinguished Lecture Series. He was a Global Visiting Professor of Law at New York University School of Law in spring 2004, and in the fall, he was the William Hughes Mulligan Visiting Professor at Fordham University School of Law. In spring 2005, he was the Henry Shattuck Visiting Professor Law at Harvard Law School. Goldstone participated as guest faculty in the Oxford-George Washington International Human Rights Program in 2005.

Goldstone was named the 2007 Weissberg Distinguished Professor of International Studies at Beloit College, in Beloit, Wisconsin. From 17 to 28 January 2007 he visited classes, worked with faculty and students, participated in panel discussions on human rights and transitional justice with leading figures in the field and delivered the annual Weissberg Lecture, &quot;South Africa&#x27;s Transition to Democracy: The Role of the Constitutional Court&quot; on 24 January at the Moore Lounge in Pearsons Hall. In Fall 2007 he was the William Hughes Mulligan Professor of International Law at Fordham University School of Law, and held that position again in Fall 2009. Fordham Law presented him with a Doctor of Laws, &quot;honoris causa&quot;, in 2007, the highest honor the school can bestow. Goldstone also was the Woodrow Wilson Visiting Scholar in Political Science at Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 2009.

He also continues as a member of the board of directors of the Salzburg Global Seminar. Goldstone serves as a trustee for Link-SA, a charity which funds the tertiary education of South Africans from impoverished backgrounds.

He is currently a member of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute&#x27;s International Council.

Goldstone serves on the Board of Directors of several nonprofit organisations that promote justice, including Physicians for Human Rights, the International Center for Transitional Justice, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, the South African Legal Services Foundation, the Brandeis University Center for Ethics, Justice, and Public Life, Human Rights Watch, and the Center for Economic and Social Rights. Goldstone was president of the Jewish training and education charity World ORT between 1997 and 2004. He was an honorary member of the Board of Governors of Hebrew University for over ten years prior to June 2010, when the university announced he had been dropped from the Board due to inactivity &quot;for a decade or more&quot;. In April 2010, Jerusalem lawyer David Schonberg had requested Goldstone be removed from the Board because of the UN report on Gaza. A university spokesperson stated that removing inactive members was a routine procedure, that other inactive members had also been removed, and that Goldstone&#x27;s removal had &quot;nothing to do with his Report about Gaza&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Goldstone has received the 1994 International Human Rights Award of the American Bar Association, the 2005 Thomas J. Dodd Prize in International Justice and Human Rights, and the 2009 MacArthur Award for International Justice, announced by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

He holds honorary degrees from Whittier College (2008), Hebrew University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Maryland, and the Universities of Cape Town, British Columbia, Glasgow, and Calgary among others. He was the first person to be granted the title, &quot;The Hague Peace Philosopher&quot; in 2009, as part of the new Spinoza Fellowship of The Hague, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS), Radio Netherlands, and The Hague Campus of Leiden University. He is an honorary fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, an honorary member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, a foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Goldstone was a fellow of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University in 1989.

== Personal life and religion ==
His family was non-religious, but he credits his Jewishness with having shaped his ethical views through being part of a community that has been persecuted throughout history. Goldstone has written about the role that those of Jewish heritage played in the fight against apartheid noting, subsequent to Nelson Mandela&#x27;s death, that Mandela had himself observed &quot;I have found Jews to be more broad-minded than most whites on issues of race and politics, perhaps because they themselves have historically been victims of prejudice.&quot;

He is married to Noleen Goldstone. They have two daughters and four grandsons.

<doc id="619662" wikidata="Q1168105" url="?curid=619662" title="The Mystery of Edwin Drood">
<text>The Mystery of Edwin Drood is the final novel by English author Charles Dickens, originally published in 1870.

Though the novel is named after the character Edwin Drood, it focuses more on Drood&#x27;s uncle, John Jasper, a precentor, choirmaster and opium addict, who lusts after his pupil, Rosa Bud. Miss Bud, Edwin Drood&#x27;s fiancée, has also caught the eye of the high-spirited and hot-tempered Neville Landless. Landless and Edwin Drood take an instant dislike to each other. Later Drood disappears under mysterious circumstances. The story is set in Cloisterham, a lightly disguised Rochester.

At the death of Dickens on 9 June 1870, the novel was left unfinished in his writing desk, only six of a planned twelve instalments having been written. He left no detailed plan for the remaining instalments or solution to the novel&#x27;s mystery, and many later adaptations and continuations by other writers have attempted to complete the story.

==Summary==
The novel begins as John Jasper leaves a London opium den. He is the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. The next evening, he is visited by his nephew, Edwin Drood. Edwin confides that he has misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud, which had been arranged by their fathers. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa at the Nuns&#x27; House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits. Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else.

Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena are sent to Cloisterham for their education. Neville will study with the minor canon the Rev. Septimus Crisparkle; Helena will live at the Nuns&#x27; House with Rosa. Neville confides to Mr Crisparkle that he had hated his cruel stepfather, while Rosa confides to Helena that she loathes and fears Jasper, who is her music master. Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa and is indignant that Edwin treats his betrothal so lightly. Edwin provokes him and he reacts violently, which gives Jasper the opportunity to spread rumours that Neville has a violent temper. Mr Crisparkle tries to reconcile Edwin and Neville; Neville agrees to apologise to Edwin if Edwin will forgive him. It is arranged that they will dine together for this purpose on Christmas Eve at Jasper&#x27;s home.

Rosa&#x27;s guardian, Mr Grewgious, tells her that she has a substantial inheritance from her father. When she asks whether there would be any forfeiture if she did not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be none on either side. Back at his office in London, Mr Grewgious gives Edwin a ring which Rosa&#x27;s father had given to her mother, with the proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his irrevocable commitment to her or return it to Mr Grewgious. Mr Bazzard, Mr Grewgious&#x27;s clerk, witnesses this transaction.

Next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal. They decide to ask Mr Grewgious to break the news to Jasper, and Edwin intends to return the ring to Mr Grewgious. Meanwhile, Durdles takes Jasper into the cathedral crypt. On the way there Durdles points out a mound of quicklime. Jasper provides Durdles with a bottle of wine. The wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles loses consciousness; while unconscious he dreams that Jasper goes off by himself in the crypt. As Jasper and Durdles return from the crypt, they encounter a boy called Deputy; Jasper, thinking he was spying on them, takes him by the throat but, realising that this will strangle him, lets him go.

On Christmas Eve, Neville buys himself a heavy walking stick; he plans to spend his Christmas break hiking in the countryside. Meanwhile, Edwin visits a jeweller to get his pocket watch repaired; it is mentioned that the only jewellery he wears is the watch and chain and a shirt pin. By chance he meets a woman who is an opium user from London. She asks Drood&#x27;s Christian name and he replies that it is &quot;Edwin&quot;; she says he is fortunate it is not &quot;Ned&quot;, for &quot;Ned&quot; is in great danger. He thinks nothing of this, for the only person who calls him &quot;Ned&quot; is Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper buys himself a black scarf of strong silk, which is not seen again during the course of the novel. The reconciliation dinner is successful and at midnight Edwin Drood and Neville Landless leave together to go down to the river and look at a storm that rages that night.

The next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper encourages suspicions that Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for his hike; the townspeople overtake him and forcibly bring him back to the city. Mr Crisparkle keeps Neville out of jail by taking responsibility for him, stating that he will produce Neville any time his presence is required. That night, Jasper is strongly affected when Mr Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa have ended their betrothal; he reacts more strongly to this news than to the possibility that Edwin may be dead. The next morning, Mr Crisparkle goes to the river weir and finds Edwin&#x27;s watch and chain and shirt pin.

Half a year later, Neville is living in London near Mr Grewgious&#x27;s office. Lieutenant Tartar introduces himself and offers to share his garden with Neville; Lt Tartar&#x27;s chambers are adjacent to Neville&#x27;s above a common courtyard. 

A white-haired and whiskered stranger calling himself Dick Datchery arrives in Cloisterham. He rents a room below Jasper&#x27;s and observes the comings and goings in the area. Going to his lodgings for the first time, Mr Datchery asks Deputy for directions. Deputy will not go near the lodgings for fear that Jasper will choke him again.

Jasper visits Rosa at the Nuns&#x27; House and professes his love for her. She rejects him but he persists, telling her that if she gives him no hope he will destroy Neville, the brother of her dear friend Helena. In fear of Jasper, Rosa flees to Mr Grewgious in London.

The next day Mr Crisparkle follows Rosa to London. While he is with her and Mr Grewgious, Lt Tartar calls and asks if he remembers him. Mr Crisparkle does remember him, as the person who years before saved him from drowning. They do not dare let Rosa contact Neville and Helena directly, for fear that Jasper may be watching Neville, but Lt Tartar allows Rosa to visit his chambers to contact Helena above the courtyard. Mr Grewgious arranges for Rosa to rent a place from Mrs Billickin and for Miss Twinkleton to live with her there for respectability.

Jasper visits the London opium den again for the first time since Edwin&#x27;s disappearance. When he leaves, at dawn, the woman who runs the opium den follows him. She vows to herself that she will not lose his trail again, as she had done after his last visit. This time, she follows him all the way to his home in Cloisterham; outside it she meets Datchery, who tells her Jasper&#x27;s name and that he will sing in the cathedral service the next morning. On inquiry, Datchery learns she is called &quot;Princess Puffer&quot;. The next morning she attends the service and shakes her fists at Jasper from behind a pillar, observed by both Datchery and Deputy.

Dickens&#x27;s death leaves the rest of the story unknown. According to his friend and biographer John Forster, after writing him two brief letters which relate to the plot (but not the murder) Dickens had supplied Forster with an outline of the full plot:

His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter in the middle of July. &quot;What should you think of the idea of a story beginning in this way?—Two people, boy and girl, or very young, going apart from one another, pledged to be married after many years—at the end of the book. The interest to arise out of the tracing of their separate ways, and the impossibility of telling what will be done with that impending fate.&quot; This was laid aside; but it left a marked trace on the story as afterwards designed, in the position of Edwin Drood and his betrothed.

I first heard of the later design in a letter dated &quot;Friday the 6th of August 1869&quot;, in which after speaking, with the usual unstinted praise he bestowed always on what moved him in others, of a little tale he had received for his journal, he spoke of the change that had occurred to him for the new tale by himself. &quot;I laid aside the fancy I told you of, and have a very curious and new idea for my new story. Not a communicable idea (or the interest of the book would be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to work.&quot; The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the originality of which was to consist in the review of the murderer&#x27;s career by himself at the close, when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if, not he the culprit, but some other man, were the tempted. The last chapters were to be written in the condemned cell, to which his wickedness, all elaborately elicited from him as if told of another, had brought him. Discovery by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder for its object, was to follow hard upon commission of the deed; but all discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till towards the close, when, by means of a gold ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body, not only the person murdered was to be identified but the locality of the crime and the man who committed it. So much was told to me before any of the book was written; and it will be recollected that the ring, taken by Drood to be given to his betrothed only if their engagement went on, was brought away with him from their last interview. Rosa was to marry Tartar, and Crisparkle the sister of Landless, who was himself, I think, to have perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer.

==Characters==
*Edwin Drood: an orphan. When he comes of age, he plans to marry Rosa Bud and go to Egypt, working as an engineer with the firm in which his father had been a partner.
*Rosa Bud: an orphan and Edwin Drood&#x27;s fiancée. Their betrothal was arranged by their fathers.
*John Jasper: the choirmaster of Cloisterham Cathedral, Edwin Drood&#x27;s uncle and guardian, and Rosa Bud&#x27;s music master. Not much older than Drood, he secretly loves Rosa. He frequently visits an opium den in London, run by Princess Puffer. It is probable (see evidence below) that Dickens intended to make him the putative murderer. Jasper seemingly takes advantage of the well-known and acrimonious rivalry between Drood and Neville Landless for Rosa&#x27;s affections, apparently murdering Drood soon after Landless&#x27;s resentful and angry remarks about Drood, thus shifting public suspicion of Drood&#x27;s murder away from himself and onto Landless. A further implication is that if Landless were to be convicted of Drood&#x27;s murder and executed, Jasper would have disposed of both of Rosa&#x27;s love interests, and would be free to try for Rosa&#x27;s hand himself. 
*Neville Landless: one of a set of orphaned twins; his sister is Helena. They are from Ceylon, but it is not clear to what extent they are Ceylonese. In their childhood they were mistreated and deprived. The immature and impressionable Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa Bud, and becomes Drood&#x27;s hated rival for her affections; he has a volatile temper (which Jasper exacerbates by drugging his wine) and is more proud than is good for him. His temper and pride cause him to become the prime suspect in Drood&#x27;s disappearance; the obvious suspicion is that he had become enraged and killed Drood in the hope of being able to win Rosa himself. His integrity prevents him from making an insincere apology to Drood.
*Helena Landless: Neville&#x27;s twin sister. Helena and Rosa become dear friends.
*The Rev. Septimus Crisparkle: minor canon of Cloisterham Cathedral and Neville Landless&#x27;s mentor.
*Mrs Crisparkle: Mr Crisparkle&#x27;s widowed mother.
*Mr (Hiram) Grewgious: a London lawyer and Rosa Bud&#x27;s guardian. He was a friend of her parents.
*Mr Bazzard: Mr Grewgious&#x27;s clerk. He is absent from that post when Datchery is in Cloisterham. He has written a play.
*(Stony) Durdles: a stonemason and the local undertaker. He knows more than anyone else about the Cloisterham Cathedral cemetery; he takes Jasper on a tour of the graveyard and tells him about the human-flesh-dissolving properties of quicklime.
*Deputy: a small boy. &quot;Deputy&quot; is a nickname he uses to conceal his own name. If he catches Durdles out after 10 pm and drunk, he throws stones at him until he goes home. Durdles pays Deputy a halfpenny per night to do so.
*Dick Datchery: an enigmatic stranger who takes lodgings in Cloisterham for a month or two. He becomes interested in Jasper and in Princess Puffer; the implication is that he is an undercover detective summoned to help solve Drood&#x27;s murder, or another character in disguise.
*Her Royal Highness the Princess Puffer: a haggard woman who runs a London opium den frequented by Jasper. She is unnamed in most of the book, and &quot;Princess Puffer&quot; is the title which Deputy gives her. She habitually claims to be helpless and ill to gain sympathy and handouts, but she secretly shows considerable savvy and cunning, both in swindling the customers of her opium den and in gleaning revealing information about them.
*Mr (Thomas) Sapsea: a comically conceited auctioneer. By the time of Drood&#x27;s disappearance he has become Mayor of Cloisterham.
*The Dean: the Dean is the most senior clergyman at Cloisterham Cathedral, a man of some gravitas to whom others behave with fitting deference. In return he can be rather condescending.
*Mr Tope: the verger of Cloisterham Cathedral.
*Mrs Tope: the verger&#x27;s wife. She cooks for Jasper and lets lodgings to Datchery.
*Miss Twinkleton: the mistress of the Nuns&#x27; House, the boarding school where Rosa lives.
*Mrs Tisher: Miss Twinkleton&#x27;s assistant at the Nuns&#x27; House.
*Mr (Luke) Honeythunder: a bombastic London philanthropist. He is Neville and Helena Landless&#x27;s guardian.
*Mr Tartar: a retired naval officer. He resigned his commission in his late twenties when an uncle left him some property, but he lives in London, being unaccustomed to the space of a large estate.
*Mrs Billickin: a widowed distant cousin of Mr Bazzard. She lets lodgings in London to Rosa and Miss Twinkleton.

==Hints and suspicions==
===The murderer===
Edwin Drood&#x27;s fate is not clear. His killer, if any, is not revealed but is generally believed to be John Jasper, his uncle, for three reasons:

# John Forster had the plot described to him by Dickens: &quot;The story ... was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle.&quot;
# Luke Fildes, who illustrated the story, said that Dickens had told him, when they were discussing an illustration, &quot;I must have the double necktie! It is necessary, for Jasper strangles Edwin Drood with it.&quot;
# Dickens&#x27;s son Charles stated that his father had told him unequivocally that Jasper was the murderer.

The book gives other hints:

# It describes a night scene in which Jasper goes secretly with Durdles to the graveyard. Jasper sees quicklime, at that time believed to hasten the decomposition of bodies.
# A day before he disappears, Edwin talks with Princess Puffer in the graveyard. She tells him &quot;Ned&quot; is in great danger. Later it turns out she has followed John Jasper from London, and he told her something in his state of intoxication. Jasper is the only person who calls Edwin Drood &quot;Ned&quot;.
# On the day Edwin is reported missing, Jasper is informed by Mr Grewgious, Rosa&#x27;s guardian, that she and Edwin have broken off their engagement. Jasper collapses in a state of shock; the implication is that he may have murdered Edwin unnecessarily.
# Rosa Bud has always been afraid of John Jasper, and in the afternoon of a warm day, half a year after Edwin&#x27;s disappearance, he tells her his love for her might be enough even to have disposed of his beloved nephew.
# Princess Puffer tries to follow Jasper; she suspects him of something because of what he said during his opium intoxication. Jasper says to her at the end of what exists of the book: &quot;Suppose you had something in your mind; something you were going to do ... Should you do it in your fancy, when you were lying here doing this? ... I did it over and over again. I have done it hundreds of thousands of times in this room.&quot;
# The very first hint (Mr Jasper being concerned about what he may say while in an opium stupor) occurs in the first pages, when Mr Jasper listens to other opium users and says &quot;unintelligible!&quot; On his last opium trip, Princess Puffer says to him, while he sleeps: &quot;&#x27;Unintelligible&#x27; I heard you say, of two more than me. But don&#x27;t ye be too sure always; don&#x27;t ye be too sure, beauty!&quot;
# On the day of Edwin&#x27;s disappearance, Jasper was in an ebullient state of mind all day, performing in the choir with great self-command.
# Another possible hint is hidden in the name of Edwin Drood. If seven of the ten letters in his name are rearranged, they spell the word DROWNED. So it is possible that Edwin suffered the same fate as his mother, who also drowned.
# &quot;The Spike that Intervenes: How I Accidentally Solved Drood&quot; is a new theory published in the summer 2024 edition of &quot;The Dickensian&quot; that attempts to unmask the real villain. Mark Wheats uses empirical evidence to contend that the main clue resides in the very first paragraph of the novel, where Dickens wrote, &quot;What IS the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?&quot; Wheats argues, &quot;if we find the spike, we find the villain&quot;, and that the figure at the top of the spiral staircase on the cover of the novel is not pointing to the choirmaster John Jasper (as if accusing him), but rather to the verger Mr Tope, who is holding &quot;the spike that intervenes&quot; -- the verger&#x27;s mace. Wheats shows that Dickens wrote of the mace in his manuscript, but chose not to include it in chapter 9 because he did not want to tip readers off too early regarding the identity of the story&#x27;s villain. Wheats also contends that &quot;The Thorn of Anxiety&quot; referred to five times in chapter 11 and once in chapter 20 is also &quot;the spike that intervenes&quot;, as a thorn is a spike in miniature. Wheats then argues that Mr Tope (whose name is a verb meaning &quot;to drink alcohol to excess&quot;) is merely a henchman, and that the main villain is the senior clergyman of the cathedral, the Dean. Using further literary evidence, Wheats concludes the Dean&#x27;s guilt, citing Dickens&#x27;s notes and use of personification.

===Dick Datchery===
Datchery appears some time after Edwin&#x27;s disappearance and keeps a close eye on Jasper. There are hints that he is in disguise, and this possibility has been taken up in adaptations of the story which try to solve the mystery: 
* In the 1935 movie production of the story, starring Claude Rains as Jasper, Datchery is Neville Landless in disguise.
* In the 1985 Rupert Holmes musical, the character of Datchery is initially played by the actress who also plays Edwin Drood, but can be voted by the audience to be revealed by Princess Puffer to be Rosa Bud, Neville Landless, Helena Landless, Bazzard or Crisparkle. 
* In Leon Garfield&#x27;s continuation, which was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 starring Ian Holm as Jasper and John Moffatt as Datchery, Datchery is a former actor turned private investigator hired by Mr Grewgious to investigate Drood&#x27;s disappearance. 
* In the 2012 BBC television drama, written by Gwyneth Hughes, Datchery is Mr Bazzard. 
* In the 2020 BBC Radio 4 adaptation (see &quot;Radio adaptations&quot; below), Datchery is a disguised Helena Landless.

==Original publication==
&quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; was scheduled to be published in twelve instalments (fewer than Dickens&#x27;s usual twenty) from April 1870 to February 1871, each costing one shilling and illustrated by Luke Fildes. Only six of the instalments were completed before Dickens&#x27;s death in 1870. It was therefore approximately half-finished.

* I: April 1870 (chapters 1–5)
* II: May 1870 (chapters 6–9)
* III: June 1870 (chapters 10–12)
* IV: July 1870 (chapters 13–16)
* V: August 1870 (chapters 17–20)
* VI: September 1870 (chapters 21–23)

Planned instalments never published:
* VII: October 1870
* VIII: November 1870
* IX: December 1870
* X: January 1871
* XI, XII: February 1871

==Continuations==
Supplying a conclusion to &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; has occupied writers from Dickens&#x27;s death to the present day.

The first three attempts to complete the story were undertaken by Americans. The first, by Robert Henry Newell, published under the pen name Orpheus C. Kerr in 1870, was as much a parody as a continuation, transplanting the story to the United States. It is a &quot;burlesque&quot; farce rather than a serious attempt to continue in the spirit of the original story.

The second ending was written by Henry Morford, a New York journalist. He travelled to Rochester with his wife and published the ending serially during his stay in England from 1871 to 1872. In this ending, Edwin Drood survives Jasper&#x27;s murder attempt. Datchery is Bazzard in disguise, but Helena disguises herself as well to overhear Jasper&#x27;s mumbling under the influence of opium. It was titled &quot;John Jasper&#x27;s Secret: Sequel to Charles Dickens&#x27; Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. Newspaper articles from 1870 confirmed that the story would be completed and authored by Charles Dickens, Jr and Wilkie Collins, despite Collins&#x27;s disavowal. The illustrative green cover for the book was designed by Charles Allston Collins, who was Charles Dickens&#x27;s son-in-law and Wilkie Collins&#x27;s brother.

The third attempt was perhaps the most unusual. In 1873, a Brattleboro, Vermont, printer, Thomas Power James, published a version which he claimed had been literally &#x27;ghost-written&#x27; by him channelling Dickens&#x27;s spirit. A sensation was created: several critics praised this version, including Arthur Conan Doyle, himself a spiritualist, who said it was similar in style to Dickens&#x27;s work; and for several decades the James version of &quot;Edwin Drood&quot; was common in America. Other &quot;Drood&quot; scholars disagree. John C. Walters dismissed it with contempt, stating that the work &quot;is self-condemned by its futility, illiteracy, and hideous American mannerisms; the mystery itself becomes a nightmare, and the solution only deepens the obscurity.&quot;

Four of the most recent of the posthumous collaborations are &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; by Leon Garfield (1980), &quot;The Decoding of Edwin Drood&quot; (1980) by Charles Forsyte, &quot;The Disappearance of Edwin Drood&quot;, a Holmesian pastiche by Peter Rowland (1992), and &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; by David Madden (2011). &quot;The D Case&quot; (1989) offered a humorous literary critique by the Italian duo Fruttero &amp; Lucentini.

==The Trial of John Jasper==

On 7 January 1914 the Dickens Fellowship organised a dramatic &quot;trial&quot; in the King&#x27;s Hall, Covent Garden, in which John Jasper stood accused of the murder of Edwin Drood. Appearing as witnesses in &quot;court&quot; were five characters from the Dickens novel, as well as a jury and court officials, mostly played by writers, actors and other leading personalities of the day.

G. K. Chesterton, best known for the Father Brown mystery stories, was the Judge. The author of &quot;The Complete Edwin Drood&quot;, J. Cuming Walters, led the prosecution, while W. Walter Crotch and Cecil Chesterton acted for the defence, and the latter&#x27;s future wife, Ada Elizabeth Chesterton (appearing under her pseudonym Miss J. K. Prothero) was Princess Puffer. Bransby Williams, well known for his stage monologues as Dickens characters, was Anthony Durdles. Authors and scholars Arthur Waugh, C. Sheridan Jones and Mrs Laurence Clay, played Crisparkle, Bazzard and Helena Landless respectively, while the part of John Jasper was taken by amateur actor Frederick T. Harry.

Foreman of the jury was George Bernard Shaw. Other jurors were selected from a list of nineteen named in the programme.  A copy of this, annotated by its original owner, suggests that the others on the jury bench were William Wymark Jacobs, William Pett Ridge, Tom Gallon, William de Morgan, Arthur Morrison, Raymond Paton, Francesco Berger, Ridgwell Callum, Justin Huntly McCarthy, Oscar Browning and William Archer.

Proceedings were very light-hearted; Shaw in particular made wisecracks at the expense of others present. For instance, Shaw said that if the prosecution thought that producing evidence would influence the jury then &quot;he little knows his functions&quot;.

The jury returned a verdict of manslaughter, Shaw stating that it was a compromise on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to convict Jasper but that they did not want to run the risk of being murdered in their beds. Both sides protested and demanded that the jury be discharged. Shaw said the jury would be only too pleased to be discharged. Chesterton ruled that the mystery of Edwin Drood was insoluble and fined everyone, except himself, for contempt of court.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
To date, there have been four film adaptations of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;.

The first two silent pictures released in 1909 (British) and 1914 (American) are unavailable to the general public and have been little seen since they were released. They were followed by:

* &quot;Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1935) released by Universal Pictures and directed by Stuart Walker, starring Claude Rains as Jasper, Douglass Montgomery as Neville, Heather Angel as Rosa, Valerie Hobson as Helena, and David Manners as Drood.
* &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1993) starring Robert Powell as John Jasper, Andrew Sachs as Durdles, Freddie Jones as Mayor Sapsea, Glyn Houston as Mr Grewgious and Gemma Craven as Miss Twinkleton.

===Television===
&quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1960) was a British television miniseries produced by ITV and broadcast live in eight episodes, starring Donald Sinden as John Jasper, Richard Pearson as Mr Crisparkle and Tim Seely as Edwin Drood. This serial is believed to be lost, as no audio or video recordings are known to exist. Photographs taken from contemporary newspaper clippings exist with the BFI.
There was a 2012 BBC television version, adapted with an original ending by Gwyneth Hughes and directed by Diarmuid Lawrence, which aired on BBC Two on 10 and 11 January 2012 and on the PBS series &quot;Masterpiece&quot; on 15 April 2012.

&quot;Taina Edvina Druda&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;) is a TV miniseries produced in Russia in 1980, adapted by Georgiy Kapralov and Alexander Orlov, directed by Alexander Orlov and with music by Eduard Artemiev. The cast included Valentin Gaft, Avangard Leontiev, Elena Koreneva and Margarita Terekhova.

===Radio===
On 5 and 12 January 1953, the CBS &quot;Suspense&quot; radio programme aired a two-part adaptation of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. It depicts John Jasper (played by Herbert Marshall) as the killer, tricked into giving himself away.

In 1965, for Radio 4&#x27;s long-running &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot;, Mollie Hardwick adapted the novel and suggested an ending. The cast included Francis de Wolff as the Narrator, John Gabriel as John Jasper, Mary Wimbush as Princess Puffer, Patrick Barr as Crisparkle, Malcolm Terris as Edwin Drood, Rosalind Shanks as Rosa, Nigel Graham as Neville Landless, Isabel Rennie as Helena Landless and Denys Blakelock as Mr Grewgious. It was repeated on 4 October 1970. The play is held in the BBC Archives (T42136, 89&#x27;40&quot;), and an off-air recording exists.

A five-part adaptation based on the Leon Garfield completion written by David Buck and directed by Gordon House was broadcast as BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot; from 3 to 30 March 1990. The cast included Ian Holm as Jasper, John Moffatt as Datchery, Gareth Thomas as Crisparkle, Michael Cochrane as Tartar, Timothy Bateson as Sapsea, Gordon Gostelow as Durdles and Anna Cropper as Mrs Tope; Mary Wimbush reprised her 1965 role of Princess Puffer and John Gabriel returned to play the role of Mr Grewgious. It was last repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra from 27 September to 1 October 2021.

A 10-part adaptation in 15-minute daily episodes, this time written by Mike Walker and directed by Jeremy Mortimer, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 21 December 2020 to 1 January 2021. The cast included Pippa Nixon as Kate Dickens (who acts as both narrator and commentator), Joel MacCormack as John Jasper, Isabella Inchbald as Rosa, Damian Lynch as Crisparkle, Rachel Atkins as Princess Puffer, Maanuv Thiara as Neville Landless, Halema Hussain as Helena Landless, Peter Davison as Mr Grewgious and Iwan Davies as Edwin Drood. Some characters, including Lt Tartar and Mayor Sapsea, are omitted from this version and Bazzard, though mentioned by Mr Grewgious, does not appear. In this adaptation, Helena disguises herself as Dick Datchery, Edwin Drood survives the attack from Jasper, and Jasper kills himself by jumping from the cathedral tower after it is revealed that he was in love with Edwin, a major departure from his character and motivations in the original novel and other adaptations.

===Theatre===

Following almost immediately upon Charles Dickens&#x27;s death, playwrights and theatre companies have mounted versions of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; with varying degrees of popularity, success, and faithfulness to the original work.

A musical comedy with book, music and lyrics by Rupert Holmes proved to be the first modern major theatrical adaptation. Because Dickens&#x27;s book was left unfinished, the musical hinges upon a novel idea: the audience decides by vote which of the characters is the murderer. The musical&#x27;s suspect pool includes John Jasper, Neville Landless, Rosa Bud, Helena Landless, Mr Crisparkle, Princess Puffer, and Mr Bazzard. Adding further interactivity, the audience chooses Rosa Bud, Neville Landless, Helena Landless, Mr Crisparkle or Mr Bazzard to play the role of Dick Datchery, since the cast votes that Edwin Drood actually was murdered and cannot be Dick Datchery. Further, two characters are chosen to develop a romance. Holmes wrote brief alternative endings for every possible voting outcome, even the most unlikely. For reasons of dramatic variety, John Jasper is presented as a red herring in the final solution. The audience is discouraged from voting for him, and in the final scene he confesses to the murder only for Durdles to reveal that Jasper hallucinated the attack on Drood after stumbling upon the scene of the murder, and disposed of the body thinking he had committed the crime himself.

&quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; musical, also known during its original run simply as &quot;Drood&quot;, was first produced in 1985 by the New York Shakespeare Festival, and then transferred to Broadway, where it ran for 608 performances (and 24 previews). It won five 1986 Tonys, including Best Musical, as well as Drama Desk and Edgar awards. The show ran for ten weeks in the West End in 1987 starring Ernie Wise as Edwin Cartwright. The musical has since played successfully in numerous regional and amateur productions. 

In 2012, Aria Entertainment produced a London revival of the musical at the Landor Theatre in April/May, which transferred to the Arts Theatre, West End, for a limited season from 18 May to 17 June. The cast included former Coronation Street star Wendi Peters as Princess Puffer, with Natalie Day as Edwin Drood, Daniel Robinson as John Jasper and Victoria Farley as Rosa Bud. The production was directed by Matthew Gould.

A Broadway revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company during the 2012–2013 season was directed by Scott Ellis and starred Chita Rivera as Princess Puffer and Stephanie J. Block as Edwin Drood. The final &quot;Murderer&quot; tabulations assigned to each of the characters and the identity of &quot;Datchery&quot; were displayed overhead on chalkboards in the foyer, visible to the departing audience.

The episode suggests that Dickens&#x27;s last novel will be completed as &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood and the Blue Elementals&quot; with Edwin&#x27;s killer being, not his uncle as originally intended, but rather blue creatures &quot;not of this earth&quot; inspired by the Gelth. The Doctor explains to Rose, however, that Dickens dies before he is able to finish the novel.

* In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Syndicate&quot;, there is a cut scene where the main character Jacob has a chance encounter with Dickens, who loses some pages from his notes, possibly causing the novel to be unfinished. A mission within the game regarding a murder investigation ostensibly provides Dickens with the inspiration for the novel.
* A 2012 episode of the Dickensian pastiche comedy radio series &quot;Bleak Expectations&quot;, &quot;A Writerly Life Made Dreadfully Different&quot;, sees the narrator Sir Philip &#x27;Pip&#x27; Bin compete in a novel-writing contest with Charles Dickens for the title of Britain&#x27;s greatest author. It is revealed that Dickens was Bin&#x27;s arch-nemesis Gently Benevolent in disguise, having kidnapped the real Dickens and forced him to write &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; as a submission.

<text>The Ferrari 575M Maranello (Type F133) is a two-seat, two-door, grand tourer manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. Launched in 2002, it is essentially an updated 550 Maranello featuring minor styling changes from Pininfarina. The 575M was replaced by the 599 GTB in the first half of 2006.
Updates from the 550 included a redesigned interior as well as a number of mechanical improvements, including bigger brake discs, a larger and more powerful engine, improved weight distribution, refined aerodynamics and fluid-dynamics along with an adaptive suspension set-up (the four independent suspensions are also controlled by the gearbox, to minimize pitch throughout the 200-milliseconds shift time). Two six-speed transmissions were available, a conventional manual gearbox and, for the first time on a Ferrari V12, the &quot;F1&quot; automated manual gearbox built by Graziano Trasmissioni. The 575 model number refers to total engine displacement in centiliters, whilst the &#x27;M&#x27; is an abbreviation of &quot;modificata&quot; (&quot;modified&quot;).

For 2005, the company released a GTC handling package and a Superamerica version (a limited run of 559 retractable hardtop variants of the coupé), along with raising the power from to .

A total of 2,056 cars were produced, including 246 with manual transmissions.

== GTC handling package ==
The GTC package included Ferrari&#x27;s fourth Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite ceramic brake system, made by Brembo (the first 3 being featured on the Challenge Stradale, F430 and Enzo) as well as a more performance-tuned suspension system, low-restriction exhaust system, and unique 19 inch wheels. The new brakes were based on the company&#x27;s Formula One technology. They used discs measuring 15.7 inches with six-piston calipers at the front and discs measuring 14.2 inches with four-piston calipers at the rear.

== Superamerica ==

Introduced in 2005, the Ferrari Superamerica was a convertible version of the 575M Maranello; it featured an electrochromic glass panel roof which rotated 180° at the rear to lie flat over the boot taking 60 seconds for operation. Patented &quot;Revocromico&quot; the roof incorporates a carbon-fiber structure that is hinged on the single axis with a luggage compartment lid, allowing access to the latter even with an open roof. The roof was manufactured in collaboration with French glass specialist Saint Gobain. With the roof open, the rear window, apart from holding the third stoplight, also acts as a wind deflector. This roof design was previously used on a 2000 Alfa Romeo Vola, designed by Leonardo Fioravanti. The Superamerica used the higher-output tune of the V12 engine used on the 575M, codenamed the F133 G, rated at and Ferrari marketed it as the world&#x27;s fastest convertible car, with a top speed of . The GTC handling package was optional.

Total production amounted to 559 units; this number followed Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s philosophy that there should always be one fewer car available than what the market demanded; only 43 of those had a manual gearbox.

== 575 GTZ ==
A special 575M was built by Zagato for Japanese Ferrari collector Yoshiyuki Hayashi, and announced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show. Designed to recall the 250 GT Berlinetta Zagato and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 250 range, the GTZ was officially endorsed by Ferrari and includes Zagato&#x27;s trademark double-bubble roofline, the custom coachbuilt bodywork recalling the styling of the Ferrari models of the 1960s and two-tone paint scheme. Six cars were built in total, that were later supplemented by three open variants based on an earlier 550 model. The mechanical components were unchanged.
== Motorsports ==

In 2003, Ferrari announced the sale of several 575M-based racing cars, known as the 575 GTC (not to be confused with the &quot;575M GTC Handling Package&quot;). Following the success of Prodrive built 550 based racing cars, Ferrari wished to offer their own racing car to customers. Introduced at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show, the 575 GTC was a modified 575M specially developed for the FIA GT Championship in collaboration with N Technology. Changes to the car included additional cooling vents on the front in order to cool the larger 6.0-liter V12 engine, an integrated roll-cage, a wider rear track, carbon-fiber body panels, a large fixed rear wing with a Gurney flap, a front splitter, and rear diffuser, a 6-speed Xtrac sequential manual transmission and the use of carbon-fiber racing seats and Lexan windows. The modifications allowed the car to achieve the dry weight of . The GTC shared the same tubular steel structure as the 575M.

The modified engine was shared with the 550 GTS and generated a power output of at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 5,200 rpm. The increase in power was achieved by installing new camshafts and using a Magneti Marelli fuel injection system in place of the Bosch Motronic unit. A top speed of was possible albeit modifications in the aerodynamic components.

Used primarily in the FIA GT Championship, the 575 GTC managed to take a single win in its first season, the Estoril 2003 race, followed by another lone win in 2004. Unfortunately the 575 GTC was not as capable as the Prodrive-built 550 GTS, and would fall from use by the end of 2005.

The 575 GTC was used as a testbed in the development of the Ferrari XX program.

<text>In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard).

SHARK has a 64-bit block size and a 128-bit key size. It is a six-round SP-network which alternates a key mixing stage with linear and non-linear transformation layers. The linear transformation uses an MDS matrix representing a Reed–Solomon error correcting code in order to guarantee good diffusion. The nonlinear layer is composed of eight 8×8-bit S-boxes based on the function &quot;F(x) = x−1&quot; over &quot;GF(28)&quot;.

Five rounds of a modified version of SHARK can be broken using an interpolation attack (Jakobsen and Knudsen, 1997).

<text>The Abitibi River is a river in northeastern Ontario, Canada, which flows northwest from Lake Abitibi to join the Moose River which empties into James Bay. This river is long, and descends . It is the ninth longest river in Ontario, Behind the Ottawa River (1,271km), St. Lawrence River (1.197km), Severn River (982km), Albany River (982km), Winnipeg River (813km), Attawapiskat River (748km), English River (615km) and Moose River(547km).

Abitibi is an Algonquin word meaning &quot;halfway water&quot;, derived from &quot;abitah&quot;, which may be translated as &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;halfway&quot;, and &quot;nipi&quot;, &quot;water&quot;. Originally used by the French to designate a band of Algonquin Indians who lived near the lake, the name was descriptive of their location halfway between the trading posts on the Hudson Bay and those on the Ottawa River.

The river was an important fur trading route for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. From 1914 Until 2014, pulp and paper, centered on the town of Iroquois Falls, was an important industry in the heavily forested region through which it flows. The region also supports tourism and gold mining.

The Abitibi Canyon Generating Station is located on the river at Abitibi Canyon. The experience of surveying the river for the purposes of building this plant was the inspiration for folk singer Wade Hemsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Black Fly Song&quot;.

<doc id="619670" wikidata="Q151932" url="?curid=619670" title="Irena Sendler">
<text>Irena Stanisława Sendler (), also referred to as Irena [[Polish name#Feminine forms|Sendlerowa]] in Poland, &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Jolanta (15 February 1910 – 12 May 2008), was a Polish humanitarian, social worker, and nurse who served in the Polish Underground Resistance during World War II in German-occupied Warsaw. From October 1943 she was head of the children&#x27;s section of &quot;Żegota&quot;, the Polish Council to Aid Jews ().

In the 1930s, Sendler conducted her social work as one of the activists connected to the Free Polish University. From 1935 to October 1943, she worked for the Department of Social Welfare and Public Health of the City of Warsaw. During the war she pursued conspiratorial activities, such as rescuing Jews, primarily as part of the network of workers and volunteers from that department, mostly women. Sendler participated, with dozens of others, in smuggling Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then providing them with false identity documents and shelter with willing Polish families or in orphanages and other care facilities, including Catholic nun convents, saving those children from the Holocaust.

The German occupiers suspected Sendler&#x27;s involvement in the Polish Underground and in October 1943 she was arrested by the Gestapo, but she managed to hide the list of the names and locations of the rescued Jewish children, preventing this information from falling into the hands of the Gestapo. Withstanding torture and imprisonment, Sendler never revealed anything about her work or the location of the saved children. She was sentenced to death but narrowly escaped on the day of her scheduled execution, after &quot;Żegota&quot; bribed German officials to obtain her release.

In post-war communist Poland, Sendler continued her social activism but also pursued a government career. In 1965, she was recognised by the State of Israel as Righteous Among the Nations. Among the many decorations Sendler received were the Gold Cross of Merit granted to her in 1946 for the saving of Jews and the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest honour, awarded late in Sendler&#x27;s life for her wartime humanitarian efforts.

==Biography==

===Before World War II===

Sendler was born on 15 February 1910 in Warsaw, to Stanisław Henryk Krzyżanowski, a physician, and his wife, Janina Karolina (née Grzybowska). She was baptized Irena Stanisława on 2 February 1917 in Otwock. She initially grew up in Otwock, a town about southeast of Warsaw, where there was a Jewish community. Her father, a humanitarian who treated the very poor, including Jews, free of charge, died in February 1917 from typhus contracted from his patients. After his death, the Jewish community offered financial help for the widow and her daughter, though Janina Krzyżanowska declined their assistance. Afterwards she lived in Tarczyn and Piotrków Trybunalski.

From 1927, Sendler studied law for two years and then Polish literature at the University of Warsaw, interrupting her studies for several years from 1932 to 1937. She opposed the ghetto benches system practiced in the 1930s at many Polish institutions of higher learning (from 1937 at the University of Warsaw) and defaced the &quot;non-Jewish&quot; identification on her grade card. She reported having suffered from academic disciplinary measures because of her activities and reputation as a communist and philo-Semite. By the outbreak of World War II she submitted her magister degree thesis, but had not taken the final exams. Sendler joined the Union of Polish Democratic Youth (&quot;Związek Polskiej Młodzieży Demokratycznej&quot;) in 1928; during the war she became a member of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). She was repeatedly refused employment in the Warsaw school system because of negative recommendations issued by the university, which ascribed radically leftist views to her.

Sendler became associated with social and educational units of the Free Polish University (&quot;Wolna Wszechnica Polska&quot;), where she met and was influenced by activists from the illegal Communist Party of Poland. At &quot;Wszechnica&quot; Sendler belonged to a group of social workers led by Professor Helena Radlińska; a dozen or more women from that circle would later engage in rescuing Jews. From her social work on-site interviews Sendler recalled many cases of extreme poverty that she encountered among the Jewish population of Warsaw.

Sendler was employed in a legal counseling and social help clinic, the Section for Mother and Child Assistance at the Citizen Committee for Helping the Unemployed. She published two pieces in 1934, both concerned with the situation of children born out of wedlock and their mothers. She worked mostly in the field, crisscrossing Warsaw&#x27;s impoverished neighborhoods, and her clients were helpless, socially disadvantaged women. In 1935, the government abolished the section. Many of its members became employees of the City of Warsaw, including Sendler in the Department of Social Welfare and Public Health.

Sendler married Mieczysław Sendler in 1931. He was mobilized for war, captured as a soldier in September 1939 and remained in a German prisoner of war camp until 1945; they divorced in 1947. She then married Stefan Zgrzembski (born Adam Celnikier), a Jewish friend and wartime companion, by whom she had three children, Janina, Andrzej (who died in infancy), and Adam (who died of heart failure in 1999). In 1957 Zgrzembski left the family; he died in 1961 and Irena remarried her first husband, Mieczysław Sendler. Ten years later they divorced again.

===During World War II===

Soon after the German invasion, on 1 September 1939, the German occupation authorities ordered Jews removed from the staff of the municipal Social Welfare Department where Sendler worked and barred the department from providing any assistance to Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish citizens. Sendler with her colleagues and activists from the department&#x27;s PPS cell became involved in helping the wounded and sick Polish soldiers. On Sendler&#x27;s initiative the cell began generating false medical documents, needed by the soldiers and poor families to obtain aid. Her PPS comrades unaware, Sendler extended such assistance also to her Jewish charges, who were now officially served only by the Jewish community institutions. With Jadwiga Piotrowska, Jadwiga Sałek-Deneko and Irena Schultz, Sendler also created other false references and pursued ingenious schemes in order to help Jewish families and children excluded from their department&#x27;s social welfare protection.

Around four hundred thousand Jews were crowded into a small portion of the city designated as the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazis sealed the area in November 1940. As employees of the Social Welfare Department, Sendler and Schultz gained access to special permits for entering the ghetto to check for signs of typhus, a disease the Germans feared would spread beyond the ghetto. Under the pretext of conducting sanitary inspections, they brought medications and cleanliness items and sneaked clothing, food, and other necessities into the ghetto. For Sendler, one initial motivation for the expanding ghetto aid operation were her friends, acquaintances and former colleagues who ended up on the Jewish side of the wall, beginning with Adam Celnikier (he managed to leave the ghetto at the time of its liquidation). Sendler and other social workers would eventually help the Jews who escaped or arrange for smuggling out babies and small children from the ghetto using various means available. Transferring Jews out of the ghetto and facilitating their survival elsewhere became an urgent priority in the summer of 1942, at the time of the Great Action.

This work was done at huge risk, as—since October 1941—giving any kind of assistance to Jews in German-occupied Poland was punishable by death, not just for the person who was providing the help but also for their entire family or household.

Sendler joined the Polish Socialists, a left-wing branch of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). The Polish Socialists evolved into the Polish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (RPPS), which cooperated with the communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR). Sendler was known there by her conspiratorial pseudonym Klara and among her duties were searching for places to stay, issuing fake documents and being a liaison, guiding activists to clandestine meetings. In the RPPS there were Poles she knew, involved in saving Jews, as well as Jews that she had helped. Sendler participated in the secret life of the ghetto. She described a commemoration event there, on the anniversary of the October Revolution but in the spirit of the Polish leftist tradition; it included artistic performances by children. While in the ghetto, she wore a Star of David as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish people.

The Jewish ghetto was a functioning community and to many Jews seemed the safest available place for themselves and their children. In addition, survival on the outside was plausible only for people with access to financial resources. This calculation lost its validity in July 1942, when the Germans proceeded with the liquidation of the ghetto in Warsaw, to be followed by the extermination of its residents. Sendler and her associates—as related by Jonas Turkow—could take a small number of children, and a certain number could be accepted and supported by Christian institutions, but a larger-scale action was prevented by the lack of funds. Initial funds for transfer and maintenance of ghetto children were provided by members of the Jewish community, still in existence, in cooperation with women from the Welfare Department. Sendler and others, in accordance with their mission, wanted to help the neediest children (such as orphans) first. Turkow, who contacted Wanda Wyrobek and Sendler to take out of the ghetto and arrange care for his daughter Margarita, wanted to prioritize children of the most &quot;deserving&quot; (accomplished) people.

During the Great Action, Sendler kept entering or trying to enter the ghetto. She made desperate attempts to save her friends, but among her former Welfare Department associates unable or unwilling to leave the ghetto were Ewa Rechtman and Ala Gołąb-Grynberg. According to Jadwiga Piotrowska, who saved numerous Jewish children, during the Great Action people from the Welfare Department operated individually (had no organization or leader). Other accounts suggest that women from that group concentrated on making arrangements for Jews who had already left the ghetto, and that Sendler in particular took care of adults and adolescents.

&quot;Żegota&quot; (the Council to Aid Jews) was an underground organization that originated on 27 September 1942 as the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews, led by Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, a resistance fighter and writer. By that time, most Polish Jews were no longer alive. &quot;Żegota&quot;, established on 4 December 1942, was a new form of the committee, expanded by the participation of Jewish parties and chaired by Julian Grobelny. It was financed by the founder of the Provisional Committee, the Government Delegation for Poland, a Polish Underground State institution representing the Polish government-in-exile. Working for &quot;Żegota&quot; from January 1943, Sendler functioned as a coordinator of the Welfare Department network. They distributed money grants that became available from &quot;Żegota&quot;. Regular payments, however insufficient for the needs, enhanced their ability to assist the hiding Jews. In 1963, Sendler specifically listed 29 people she worked with within the &quot;Żegota&quot; operation, adding that 15 more perished during the war. In regard to the action of saving Jewish children, according to a 1975 opinion written by Sendler&#x27;s former Welfare Department co-workers, she was the most active and organizationally gifted of participants.

During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a network of emergency shelters was created by Sendler&#x27;s group: private residencies where Jews could be temporarily housed, while &quot;Żegota&quot; worked on producing documents and finding longer-term locations for them. Many Jewish children went through the homes of Izabella Kuczkowska, Zofia Wędrychowska, and other social workers. Helena Rybak and Jadwiga Koszutska were activists from the communist underground.

In August 1943, &quot;Żegota&quot; set up its children&#x27;s section, directed by Aleksandra Dargiel, a manager in the Central Welfare Council (RGO). Dargiel, overwhelmed by her RGO duties, resigned in September and proposed Sendler to be her replacement. Sendler, then known by her &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Jolanta, took over the section from October 1943.

Permanently, Jewish children were placed by Sendler&#x27;s network with Polish families (25%), in Warsaw orphanage of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary led by Mother Provincial Matylda Getter, Roman Catholic convents such as the Sister Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Turkowice (sisters Aniela Polechajłło and Antonina Manaszczuk) or the Felician Sisters, in Boduen Home charity facilities for children, and other orphanages (75%). A nun convent offered the best opportunity for a Jewish child to survive and be taken care of. To accomplish the transfers and placement of children, Sendler worked closely with other volunteers. The children were often given Christian names and taught Christian prayers in case they were tested. Sendler wanted to preserve the children&#x27;s Jewish identities, so she kept careful documentation listing their Christian names, given names, and current locations.

According to American historian Debórah Dwork, Sendler was the inspiration and the prime mover for the whole network that saved Jewish children. She and her co-workers buried lists of the hidden children in jars in order to keep track of their original and new identities. The aim was to return the children to their original families, if still alive after the war.

On 18 October 1943, Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo. As they ransacked her house, Sendler tossed the lists of children to her friend Janina Grabowska, who hid the list in her loose clothing. Should the Gestapo access this information, all children would be compromised, but Grabowska was never searched. The Gestapo took Sendler to their headquarters and beat her brutally. Despite this, she refused to betray any of her comrades or the children they rescued. She was placed in the Pawiak prison, where she was subjected to further interrogations and beatings, and from there on 13 November taken to another location, to be executed by firing squad. According to biographer Anna Mieszkowska and Sendler, these events took place on 20 January. Her life was saved, however, because the German guards escorting her were bribed, and she was released on the way to the execution. Sendler was freed due to the efforts of Maria Palester, a fellow Welfare Department activist, who obtained the necessary funds from &quot;Żegota&quot; chief Julian Grobelny; she used her contacts and a teenage daughter to transfer the bribe money. On 30 November, Warsaw&#x27;s mayor Julian Kulski asked the German authorities for permission to re-employ Sendler in the Welfare Department with back-pay for the period of her imprisonment. Permission was granted on 14 April 1944, but Sendler found it prudent to remain in hiding, as Klara Dąbrowska, a nurse. Already in mid-December 1943, she resumed her duties as manager of the children&#x27;s section of &quot;Żegota&quot;.

During the Warsaw Uprising, Sendler worked as a nurse in a field hospital, where a number of Jews were hidden among other patients. She was wounded by a German deserter she encountered while searching for food. She continued to work as a nurse until the Germans left Warsaw, retreating before the advancing Soviet troops.

===After World War II===

Sendler&#x27;s hospital, now at Okęcie, previously supported by &quot;Żegota&quot;, ran out of resources. She hitchhiked in military trucks to Lublin, to obtain funding from the communist government established there, and then helped Maria Palester to reorganize the hospital as the Warsaw&#x27;s Children Home. Sendler also resumed other social work activities and quickly advanced within the new structures, in December 1945 becoming head of the Department of Social Welfare in Warsaw&#x27;s municipal government. She ran her department according to concepts, radical at the time, that she had learned from Helena Radlińska at the Free University.

Sendler and her co-workers gathered all of the records with the names and locations of the hidden Jewish children and gave them to their &quot;Żegota&quot; colleague Adolf Berman and his staff at the Central Committee of Polish Jews. Almost all of the children&#x27;s parents had been murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp or had gone missing. Berman and Sendler both felt that the Jewish children should be reunited with &quot;their nation&quot;, but argued vehemently about specific aims and methods; most children were taken out of Poland.

Over the years, among Sendler&#x27;s social and formal functions were a membership in Warsaw City Council, chairmanships of the Commission for Widows and Orphans and of the Health Commission there, activity in the League of Women and in the managing councils of the Society of Friends of Children and the Society for Lay Schools.

Sendler joined the communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party in January 1947 and remained a member of its successor, the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, until the party&#x27;s dissolution in 1990. According to the research done by Anna Bikont, in 1947 Sendler advanced to the party executive by becoming a member of the Social Welfare Section at the Central Committee&#x27;s Social-Vocational Department. From then she continuously held a succession of high-level party and administrative posts during the entire Stalinist period and beyond, including the jobs of department director in the Ministry of Education from 1953 and of department director in the Ministry of Health in 1958–1962. Especially prior to 1950, Sendler was heavily involved in Central Committee work and party activism, which included implementation of social rules and propagation of ideas dictated by the Stalinist doctrine, and policy enforcement; by engaging in such pursuits, she abandoned some of her previously held views and lost some important acquaintances. After the fall of communism, however, Sendler claimed having been brutally interrogated in 1949 by the Ministry of Public Security, accused of hiding among her employees politically active former members of the Home Army (AK), a resistance organization loyal during the war to the Polish government-in-exile. She attributed the premature birth of her son Andrzej, who did not survive, to such persecution. Anna Bikont quoted Władysław Bartoszewski, who asserted before his death in 2015 that Sendler was not persecuted in communist Poland. Her continuing employment in high-level state positions also speaks against the possibility that she was a subject of serious investigation.

In the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Sendler received at least six decorations, including the Gold Cross of Merit (&quot;Złoty Krzyż Zasługi&quot;) for the wartime saving of Jews in 1946, another Gold Cross of Merit in 1956, and the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1963. Materials dealing with her activities during the war were published, but Sendler became a well-known public personality only after being &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the group from an American high school in 2000 (at the age of ninety). She was recognized by Yad Vashem as one of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations and received her award at the embassy of Israel in Warsaw in 1965, together with Irena Schultz. In 1983 she traveled to Israel, invited by Yad Vashem Institute for the tree-planting ceremony.

From 1962, Sendler worked as deputy director in several Warsaw trade medical schools. At every stage of her career, she worked long hours and was intensely involved in various social work programs, such as helping teenage prostitutes in the ruins of post-war Warsaw recover and return to society, organizing a number of orphanages and care centers for children, families and the elderly, or a center for prostitutes in Henryków. She was known for her effectiveness and displayed a sharp edge when confronted with obstruction or indifference.

Sendler&#x27;s husband, Stefan Zgrzembski, never shared her enthusiasm for the post-1945 reality. Their marriage kept deteriorating. According to Janina Zgrzembska, their daughter, neither parent paid much attention to the two children. Sendler was entirely consumed by her social work passion and career, at the expense of her own offspring, who were raised by a housekeeper. Around 1956, Sendler asked Teresa Körner, whom she had helped during the war and who was now in Israel, to assist her with immigration to Israel with children, who were Jewish and not safe in Poland. Körner discouraged Sendler&#x27;s move.

In the spring of 1967, suffering from a variety of health problems, including a heart condition and anxiety disorder, Sendler applied for a disability pension. She was dismissed from the school&#x27;s vice-principal position in May 1967, shortly before the Arab–Israeli War. From the fall of 1967, she continued working at the same school as a teacher, manager of teacher workshops and librarian, until her 1983 retirement. According to Sendler, in 1967 her daughter Janina was removed from the already published list of students admitted to the University of Warsaw, but Janina reported that she had simply failed to satisfy the admission requirements. The antisemitic campaign of 1967–68 in Poland left Sendler deeply traumatized.

Sendler never told her children of the Jewish origin of their father; Janina Zgrzembska found out as an adult. It wouldn&#x27;t make any difference, she said: the way they were brought up, race or origin didn&#x27;t matter.

In 1980, Sendler joined the Solidarity movement. She lived in Warsaw for the remainder of her life. She died on 12 May 2008, aged 98, and is buried in Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery.

==Recognition and remembrance==

In 1965, Sendler was recognized by Yad Vashem as one of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations. In 1983 she was present when a tree was planted in her honor at the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations.

In 1991, Sendler was made an honorary citizen of Israel. On 12 June 1996, she was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. She received a higher version of this award, the Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star, on 7 November 2001.

Sendler&#x27;s achievements were largely unknown in North America until 1999, when students at a high school in Uniontown, Kansas, led by their teacher Norman Conard, produced a play based on their research into her life story, which they called &quot;Life in a Jar&quot;. The play was a surprising success, staged over 200 times in the United States and abroad, and it significantly contributed to publicizing Sendler&#x27;s story. In March 2002, Temple B&#x27;nai Jehudah of Kansas City presented Sendler, Conard, and the students who produced the play with its annual award &quot;for contributions made to saving the world&quot; (Tikkun olam award). The play was adapted for television as &quot;The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler&quot; (2009), directed by John Kent Harrison, in which Sendler was portrayed by actress Anna Paquin.

In 2003, Pope John Paul II sent Sendler a personal letter praising her wartime efforts. On 10 November 2003, she received the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest civilian decoration, and the Polish-American award, the Jan Karski Award &quot;For Courage and Heart&quot;, given by the American Center of Polish Culture in Washington, D.C.

In 2006, Polish NGOs &quot;Centrum Edukacji Obywatelskiej&quot; and &quot;Stowarzyszenie Dzieci Holocaustu&quot;, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland, and the Life in a Jar Foundation established the Irena Sendler&#x27;s Award &quot;For Repairing the World&quot; (:pl:Nagroda imienia Ireny Sendlerowej &quot;Za naprawianie świata&quot;), awarded to Polish and American teachers. The Life in a Jar Foundation is a foundation dedicated to promoting the attitude and message of Irena Sendler.

On 14 March 2007, Sendler was honoured by the Senate of Poland, and a year later, on 30 July, by the United States Congress. On 11 April 2007, she received the Order of the Smile; at that time, she was the oldest recipient of the award. In 2007 she became an honorary citizen of the cities of Warsaw and Tarczyn.

===Posthumously===

In April 2009 Sendler was posthumously granted the Humanitarian of the Year award from The Sister Rose Thering Endowment, and in May 2009, Sendler was posthumously granted the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award.

Around this time American filmmaker Mary Skinner filmed a documentary, &quot;Irena Sendler, In the Name of Their Mothers&quot; (Polish: &quot;Dzieci Ireny Sendlerowej&quot;), featuring the last interviews Sendler gave before her death. The film made its national U.S. broadcast premiere through KQED Presents on PBS in May 2011 in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day and went on to receive several awards, including the 2012 Gracie Award for outstanding public television documentaries.

In 2010 a memorial plaque commemorating Sendler was added to the wall of 2 Pawińskiego Street in Warsaw – a building in which she worked from 1932 to 1935. In 2015 she was honoured with another memorial plaque at 6 Ludwiki Street, where she lived from the 1930s to 1943. Several schools in Poland have also been named after her.

In 2013 the walkway in front of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw was named after Sendler.

In 2016, a permanent exhibit was established to honor Sendler&#x27;s life at the Lowell Milken Center for Unsung Heroes museum, in Fort Scott, KS.

Gal Gadot has been cast to play Sendler in a historic thriller written by Justine Juel Gillmer and produced by Pilot Wave.

On 15 February 2020 Google celebrated her 110th birthday with a Google Doodle.

In 2021 a statue of her in Newark, Nottinghamshire, was announced.

===Literature===

In 2010, Polish historian Anna Mieszkowska wrote a biography &quot;Irena Sendler: Mother of the Children of the Holocaust&quot;. In 2011, Jack Mayer tells the story of the four Kansas school girls and their discovery of Irena Sendler in his novel &quot;Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Irena&#x27;s Children&quot;, a book about Sendler written by Tilar J. Mazzeo, was released by Simon &amp; Schuster. A version adapted to be read by children was created by Mary Cronk Farell. The young reader&#x27;s edition was named as a notable book for older readers by the Sydney Taylor Book Award. Another children&#x27;s picture book titled &quot;Jars of Hope: How One Woman Helped Save 2,500 Children During the Holocaust&quot;, is written by Jennifer Roy and illustrated by Meg Owenson.

&quot;Sendlerowa. W ukryciu&quot; (&#x27;Sendler: In Hiding&#x27;), a biography and book about the people and events related to Sendler&#x27;s wartime activities, was written by Anna Bikont and published in 2017. The book received the 2018 Ryszard Kapuściński Award for Literary Reportage.

==Notes==
&quot;a.&quot;Sendler was one of the first Poles recognized as Righteous Among the Nations due to the efforts of Jonas Turkow, who stated for a Polish language periodical in Israel: &quot;This noble woman ... worked for &quot;Żegota&quot; and saved hundreds of Jewish children, placing them in orphanages, convents and other places&quot;. The number of Jewish children saved through Sendler&#x27;s efforts is not known. The Social Welfare Department of the Central Committee of Polish Jews stated in January 1947 that Sendler saved at least several dozen Jewish children. Later in her life, Sendler repeatedly claimed that she had saved 2,500 Jewish children. When Michał Głowiński, who as a child survived the war with Sendler&#x27;s help, was working on his book &quot;The Black Seasons&quot; in the late 1990s, Sendler insisted that he write about the 2,500 children she saved. As Głowiński later told Anna Bikont, he felt obliged to comply because &quot;one cannot refuse Sendler&quot;. Sendler often spoke of the list of 2,500 children she produced, kept in two bottles and gave to Adolf Berman, but no such list has ever materialized and Berman never mentioned its existence. For the first time she talked about the list and the 2,500 saved children (and adults) in 1979; back then, however, she did not suggest that she was personally responsible for their survival and named twenty-four people also involved in their rescue.

&quot;b.&quot;Actual events tend to be difficult to reconstruct because later, purposely or inadvertently, for different audiences and at different times, Sendler told different stories with aspects that were mutually incompatible or contrary to known facts. For example, in 1998 Sendler claimed that the communist authorities kept refusing to issue her passport for twenty years, despite the invitations from Yad Vashem she had been receiving during that period. Anna Bikont found those claims to be false. The passport was refused in 1981, after the first such invitation, because of the lack of diplomatic relations with Israel, and the decision was reversed in 1983. Previously Sendler also had a passport: on several occasions she went to Sweden to visit her son, who was receiving medical treatment there.

<text>Rauman maalaiskunta (the rural municipality of Rauma, often abbreviated Rauman mlk) is a former municipality of Finland. It was annexed to Rauma on 1 January 1993. The population of the municipality at the time of annexation was about 9,000. The municipality was originally formed in 1476 when a border was drawn between the town of Rauma and the surrounding countryside. The townspeople had seafaring rights, which the country dwellers lacked. Between the 17th century and early 19th century, customs fees were levied on goods passing either to or from the town, and even a border wall existed. A place in Rauma is still called &quot;Porintulli&quot; (Customs of Pori) – a place for the customs on the road to Pori.

<doc id="619683" wikidata="Q4777178" url="?curid=619683" title="Arthur Chaskalson">
<text>Arthur Chaskalson SCOB, (24 November 1931 – 1 December 2012) was President of the Constitutional Court of South Africa from 1994 to 2001 and Chief Justice of South Africa from 2001 to 2005. Chaskalson was a member of the defence team in the Rivonia Trial of 1963.

==Early life and career==
Born in Johannesburg, Chaskalson was educated at Hilton College and later graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand with a BCom (1952) and LLB Cum Laude (1954).

In 1963, Chaskalson, along with Bram Fischer, Joel Joffe, Harry Schwarz, George Bizos, Vernon Berrangé and Harold Hanson, was part of the former President Nelson Mandela&#x27;s defence team in the Rivonia Trial, which saw Mandela sentenced to life imprisonment.

Chaskalson left a very successful legal practice to become a human rights lawyer, helping to establish the Legal Resources Centre, a non-profit organisation modeled after the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in the United States seeking to use the law to pursue justice and human rights around South Africa. Chaskalson served as the centre&#x27;s director from November 1978 until September 1993. In 1975 and 1983, he was leading counsel in the cases of Veli Komani and Mehlolo Tom Rikhotso, which successfully challenged the legality of apartheid legislation seeking to establish influx control, crippling the government&#x27;s ability to enforce influx control laws.

== Constitutional Court ==
As the first president of South Africa&#x27;s new Constitutional Court in 1994, and then later Chief Justice of the same court (following a Constitutional amendment act in 2001 which changed his title), Chaskalson gained a reputation as one of South Africa&#x27;s leading jurists in constitutional and human rights issues. Chaskalson was a member of the technical committee on constitutional issues appointed by the multi-party negotiating forum in May 1993, acting as a key advisor on the adoption of the Interim Constitution of South Africa in 1993, and was regarded as one of the prime movers of a changing judiciary in South Africa during his time on the bench of the Constitutional Court. 

The court&#x27;s first major decision under Chaskalson&#x27;s leadership abolished the death penalty in &quot;S v Makwanyane&quot; on 6 June 1995. He also wrote notable majority judgments in &quot;Soobramoney v Minister of Health, KwaZulu-Natal&quot; and &quot;Minister of Public Works v Kyalami Ridge Environmental Association&quot;, and he co-wrote &quot;Fedsure Life Assurance v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council&quot; with Justices Richard Goldstone and Kate O&#x27;Regan.

Chaskalson also became prominent internationally, becoming commissioner of the International Commission of Jurists in 1995 before being selected as one of South Africa&#x27;s four members on the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration in 1999. In 1989, he consulted on the writing of the Constitution of Namibia. He became the President of the International Commission of Jurists then from 2002 until 2008.

== Retirement ==
On 31 May 2005, Chaskalson retired as Chief Justice and was replaced by his former deputy Pius Langa. In his 2005 State of the Nation speech shortly before Chaskalson&#x27;s retirement, South African President Thabo Mbeki praised the Chief Justice as a &quot;great son of our people&quot; and a &quot;giant among the architects of our democracy&quot;. Mbeki paid tribute to Chaskalson for everything he had done &quot;as a South African, a lawyer and a judge, to shepherd us towards the construction of a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it&quot;.

He died in Johannesburg on 1 December 2012 from leukemia and was buried in Westpark Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Chaskalson was survived by his wife Lorraine, with whom he had two sons and five grandchildren. Chaskalson was Jewish and was associated with Progressive synagogues in Johannesburg.

==Honours and awards==
In 2002 he was awarded the Order of the Baobab (Gold) for &quot;exceptional service in law, constitutional jurisprudence and human rights&quot;.

<text>Gabrielle Monique Union-Wade ( Union; born October 29, 1972) is an American actress. Her career began in the 1990s, when she made dozens of appearances on television sitcoms, prior to landing supporting roles in 1999 teen films &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;. She rose to greater prominence the following year, after she landed her breakthrough role in the teen film &quot;Bring It On&quot;.

Union is known for her performances in the romantic comedy films &quot;The Brothers&quot; (2001), &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot; (2003), &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot; (2007), &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; (2012) and &quot;Think Like a Man Too&quot; (2014). She also had starring roles in the CBS medical drama series &quot;City of Angels&quot; (2000) and in the films &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; (2003), &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; (2003), &quot;Neo Ned&quot; (2005), &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; (2008), &quot;Top Five&quot; (2014), &quot;Breaking In&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Perfect Find&quot; (2023). She has also co-starred in the films &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (2016), &quot;Almost Christmas&quot; (2016) and &quot;Sleepless&quot; (2017).

Union starred as the lead characters in BET drama series &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot; (2013–2019), for which she has received an NAACP Image Award, and in the crime series &quot;L.A.&#x27;s Finest&quot; (2019–2020). Outside of acting, Union has written four books: two memoirs, titled &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Need More Wine&quot; (2017) and &quot;You Got Anything Stronger?&quot; (2021), and two children&#x27;s books, titled &quot;Welcome to the Party&quot; (2020) and &quot;Shady Baby&quot; (2021).

She has also been an outspoken advocate for issues involving women&#x27;s health, LGBTQ+ equality, and violence against women, and was awarded the President&#x27;s Award from the NAACP Image Awards, alongside her husband Dwyane Wade for their humanitarian efforts. Union was included on &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2020.

==Early life==
Union was born on October 29, 1972, in Omaha, Nebraska, the daughter of Theresa ( Glass), a phone company manager and social worker, and Sylvester E. Union, a military sergeant. She was raised Catholic. During her childhood, she was taught to be &quot;an independent woman, standing on my own two feet, and that&#x27;s the road I opted to take.&quot; According to Union, her mother taught her to have a &quot;world perspective&quot; and took her to a gay pride parade at the age of eight after the family moved to Pleasanton, California. She attended Foothill High School where she was a year-round student athlete, competing in Varsity soccer, track, and basketball. Union dated fellow student Jason Kidd during her junior year.

Union&#x27;s parents divorced after 30 years of marriage. She said, &quot;They handled their divorce and our subsequent transition into a blended family with grace, dignity and respect. They always put us first and didn&#x27;t involve us. I&#x27;m lucky that I can just mirror what my parents did and always put the kids first. They&#x27;re pretty awesome. I&#x27;m lucky.&quot;

Union grew up with self-esteem issues relating to colorism, as one of the few African-American children in her environment. When Union was younger, she believed that &quot;blonde was the ideal of beauty, and if I looked nothing like that, then I must be ugly.&quot; On her college football memories, Union reflected, &quot;In my family if you couldn&#x27;t talk Cornhusker football—that means knowing the Blackshirt defense, knowing the I-back formation—then you don&#x27;t get to have an opinion. When I first toured the Nebraska campus and I saw Turner Gill walk, I freaked out. That was like the biggest star-struck moment I&#x27;ve probably ever had in my life. But it&#x27;s because I grew up in a household that always talked specifically Cornhusker football and Big 8 sports at the time.&quot;

During the summer before starting her sophomore year of college at UCLA, at the age of 19, Union was attacked and raped at gunpoint at her part-time job at a Payless shoe store by a robber. Union has stated that she would not have survived the attack had it not been for self-defence lessons she had learned by watching Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s talk show. She later successfully sued Payless for negligence, alleging that the store failed to warn employees about the assailant, who had been positively identified robbing another Payless location prior to when he raped her.

Union has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from UCLA.

==Career==
===Early roles===
Union started her acting career with minor roles. Her first audition was for &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. In 1997, Union appeared in the sixth-season episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;—&quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; as the Klingon N&#x27;Garen. She also appeared in &quot;Moesha&quot; as Ashli, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; as Vanessa, in &quot;Smart Guy&quot; as Denise, and in five episodes of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; as Keesha Hamilton. She also appeared on an episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress&quot;, as Kristen, a love interest to both Ross and Joey. Other earlier roles included teen movies such as &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;.

=== 2000–2009 ===

Union appeared in the 2000 film &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot;. She then played the role of Isis in the cheerleading movie &quot;Bring It On&quot;, which helped push Union into the mainstream. &quot;Bring It On&quot; led to Union being cast in the CBS television drama &quot;City of Angels&quot; as Dr. Courtney Ellis. In 2001, Union was featured in &quot;The Brothers&quot; and was seen as having a &quot;beguiling sincerity, even when she&#x27;s fudging the truth.&quot; Union was cast in her first leading role in the 2003 film &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot;. When casting Eva, director Gary Hardwick was looking for an actress capable of instantly changing &quot;from funny to caustic and dramatic.&quot; Hardwick had previously worked with Union in &quot;The Brothers&quot; and believed she was perfect for the role of Eva. Union&#x27;s role in the film was met with praise, with Dustin Putman of &quot;All-Reviews.com&quot; writing that she was &quot;the star attraction, and the number-one reason to even consider seeing the film.&quot; Union drew influence from her father for the &quot;stern&quot; look she had in the film, admitting that she had stolen it from him.

In 2003, Union landed the role of the main character Mike Lowrey&#x27;s girlfriend, Syd, in the film &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, a box-office success grossing more than $273million worldwide. Union felt that she had been &quot;blessed&quot; with her role in the film, feeling it elevated her career. That same year, she lent her voice to the animated television series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;. Union also starred in the 2004 film &quot;Breakin&#x27; All the Rules&quot;, which was unpopular with critics. She appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Neo Ned&quot;, portraying an African-American woman with delusions that she is Adolf Hitler. She and co-star Jeremy Renner were noted by Mark Olsen of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as having &quot;a strange, offbeat chemistry that drives the film&quot;. She won an award for Best Actress in &quot;Neo Ned&quot; at the Palm Beach International Film Festival, and the film received awards at several festivals.

She starred in the 2005 remake of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. That year, Union also starred in the short-lived ABC series &quot;Night Stalker&quot;. She called the series a &quot;reworking&quot; rather than a remake. Union admitted that at the time of getting the script she was turned off, but she became interested after reading the script at her agent&#x27;s insistence. She then met with series creator Frank Spotnitz and executive producer Daniel Sackheim, who told her they thought of her anytime they thought of the character. In 2006, she starred in the music video for Busta Rhymes&#x27; &quot;I Love My Bitch&quot;.

Union starred in the 2007 film &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot; by Tyler Perry. The role of Julia Rossmore, a romantically challenged attorney, was written with her in mind. Before working with Perry, she went to see his stage show to both understand him and his audience. She filmed &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot; in mid-2006 in Atlanta, Georgia. Union was praised for her character&#x27;s portrayal and for having a &quot;great sense of comedic timing&quot;. Union&#x27;s character also drew comparisons to Eva, her role in &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot;. According to Union, Perry had specifically approached her over not turning the role into the same character. Union starred with Morris Chestnut in the 2007 Christmas film &quot;The Perfect Holiday&quot;. Since she had no children of her own, Union drew on her familiarity with her mother and sister to portray the divorced single mother of three in the film. Union initially turned down the role, as she did not want to get typecast for playing a mother until she was told of other actresses that had played similar roles and still found success in their careers.

In an interview with &quot;Art Nouveau Magazine&quot;, Union complained about the lack of roles for Black actresses and actors in Hollywood: &quot;There used to be [roles] specifically written black, if you knew Denzel was doing a movie you knew his wife, girl or love interest was going to be black [but] that&#x27;s not necessarily the case anymore. You&#x27;re in that room with every amazingly talented actress of every hue, and it&#x27;s a dogfight, it&#x27;s hard.&quot;

In 2008, Union appeared on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; for three episodes as Renee, Wilhelmina Slater&#x27;s sister and Daniel Meade&#x27;s love interest. She also made a cameo appearance in the music video for Ne-Yo&#x27;s &quot;Miss Independent&quot;. Union appeared in the 2008 film &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;. She portrayed Geneva Wade, who later married Muddy Waters. Union, who was reported to have signed on to the film in March 2008, was seen as a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; in the film, and her performance was said to have shown she had larger acting range than her previous roles. Union later called taking the role of Geneva Wade in the film the best business decision she had ever made. Union appeared in the 2008 film &quot;Meet Dave&quot;, playing the love interest of the title character. Union said the film was a gift. That same year, she wrote the foreword for Hill Harper&#x27;s &quot;Letters to a Young Sister: DeFINE your Destiny&quot;. Union joined the cast of the American television series &quot;Life&quot; on NBC and appeared in four episodes prior to its cancellation in May 2009. She appeared in the ABC series &quot;FlashForward&quot;, a role for which she was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2010.

=== 2010s ===

After she was reported to be joining the cast in June 2010, Union appeared in episodes of &quot;Army Wives&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 2010 and 2011. Union was reported in May 2011 to have landed roles in &quot;Think Like a Man&quot;, a romantic comedy based on Steve Harvey&#x27;s book &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man&quot;, and an indie film, &quot;Family Tree&quot;. In June 2011, Union defended the music video for the Rihanna single &quot;Man Down&quot; after it sparked controversy for its depiction of a rape victim shooting and killing her attacker. Union related that every rape victim was &quot;unique&quot;, which extended to how they believed justice should be carried out.

In January 2012, Union was announced to be a participant in Bounce TV&#x27;s documentary &quot;Our History&quot;. In 2012, she played Natalie in the romantic comedy &quot;Good Deeds&quot;, playing the fiancée of the Wesley Deeds character. Union said that after she read the script, she became interested in working with Tyler Perry again and enjoyed working with the cast. She then appeared in Steve Harvey&#x27;s film &quot;Think Like a Man&quot;. Union related to her character for having married and divorced young. She and Meagan Good were seen as having taken advantage of their &quot;straightforward characters to add spots of comic zest as well.&quot; Her next appearance was &quot;In Our Nature&quot;. The film was the directorial debut of Brian Savelson. Savelson had offered Union the role two years prior to the film&#x27;s release in 2010. Union saw &quot;In Our Nature&quot; as a personal victory for her career.

In 2013, she began starring in the BET network show &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;. Union learned of the series while auditioning for &quot;Scandal&quot; for the role of Olivia Pope, which ultimately went to Kerry Washington. Union has said that she is content with having lost the role in &quot;Scandal&quot; to Washington: &quot;I didn&#x27;t get &quot;Scandal&quot;, but I got something better, which is my own show.&quot; Union was impressed with the show&#x27;s quality and professionalism. Also in 2013, Union starred in Ava DuVernay&#x27;s short film &quot;The Door&quot; as part of Miu Miu&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Tales campaign.

Union reprised her role as Kristen in &quot;Think Like a Man Too&quot; in 2014, but it received mostly negative reviews. She believed the film would do well and faced comparisons to her character, who was a newlywed while Union was engaged at the time, a similarity she dispelled by insisting she kept her relationship &quot;enjoyable, fresh and exciting&quot;. Union was announced in July 2014 as a producer in the Lifetime film &quot;With This Ring&quot;. She was featured in Chris Rock&#x27;s &quot;Top Five&quot;, playing the fiancée of Rock&#x27;s character. Union viewed her &quot;Top Five&quot; character as being similar to members of the Kardashian family or the Braxton sisters. In November 2015, Union began voicing Nala in the Disney movie and series &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;. In October 2016, Union was featured in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; as Esther, a slave in the Antebellum South who is raped by a white man. Union stated in an op-ed for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that she took the role due to her relating to it as a rape victim herself. Later that year, Union had a prominent role as Rachel Meyers in the comedy film &quot;Almost Christmas&quot;, released in November. Ariel Scotti of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned Union&#x27;s performance: &quot;Each overused phrase that falls out of her character, Rachel&#x27;s, vindictive, childish mouth takes viewers further out of the movie experience.&quot;

In 2017, Union launched Flawless by Gabrielle Union, a line of hair-care products that catered to people with textured hair. In September 2017, Union announced a collaborative partnership with Invicta Watch Group that included a line of watches she designed. In 2018, she starred in the action thriller film &quot;Breaking In&quot;.

In 2019, Union began starring as Syd Burnett in the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; spin-off &quot;L.A.&#x27;s Finest&quot;, a Charter Spectrum original series that premiered May 13 and was later renewed for a second season. Union was also a judge for the fourteenth season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. In November 2019, the show failed to renew her contract for another season, allegedly because she spoke out against racism. Union&#x27;s fellow &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; judge Julianne Hough&#x27;s contract was also not renewed. In May 2020, Union filed a discrimination suit against the producers of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, citing racism and prejudice.

=== 2020s ===

On Disney Investor Day, December 11, 2020, it was announced that Union would be starring with Zach Braff in a remake of &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which was released under the same title in March 2022. In December 2021, she played Tootie Ramsey in &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; segment of the third edition of &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot;, recreating the episode &quot;Kids Can Be Cruel&quot;.

In March 2022, she was cast as the lead for the third season of &quot;Truth Be Told&quot; on Apple TV+.

She returned to &quot;The Proud Family&quot; on its sequel series &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot; in a second-season episode airing in early 2023.

=== Books ===
In April 2017, Union announced her first book, a memoir titled &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Need More Wine.&quot; The book &quot;feature[s] personal stories and reflections on a range of topics that continue to define the contemporary landscape: sexuality, womanhood, friendship, race, marriage, and beauty.&quot; Union described the book as &quot;the good, the bad, and the WTF.&quot; Released on October 17, 2017, the book was published by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. In December 2017, it was named a &quot;Best Book of the Year by a Black Author&quot; by The Root magazine.

In May 2020, Union released her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Welcome to the Party&quot;, an ode to newborns and non-traditional families that was inspired by her daughter. She collaborated with her husband Dwyane Wade on a second children&#x27;s book, &quot;Shady Baby&quot;, published on May 18, 2021. She released a second memoir, &quot;You Got Anything Stronger?: Stories&quot; on September 14, 2021.

Union has also spoken about the importance of therapy, and how she herself was able to quickly find therapy with the help of family members and co-workers.

Union addressed the killing of Trayvon Martin, stating that &quot;when you have influence, I think it&#x27;s the responsible thing to do, to speak out on an issue when you see injustice. I&#x27;m still fighting for Trayvon [...] we all should.&quot; In the months following Martin&#x27;s death, Union supported a petition that called for Florida District Attorney Norman Wolfinger to bring charges against George Zimmerman. After Zimmerman was acquitted of charges in Martin&#x27;s death in July 2013, Union remarked, &quot;Apparently walking while black is a crime punishable by death.&quot;

Union rebuked Todd Akin&#x27;s position on abortion, which he defended saying that a woman would not be able to get pregnant in the case of &quot;legitimate rape.&quot;

When Tanganyika Williams, the aunt of NBA player Matt Barnes, was murdered on July 8, 2014, Union posted calls on both Instagram and Twitter for anyone with information on Tanganyika&#x27;s killer to report it to authorities.

Oprah Winfrey said she was inspired by Union&#x27;s &quot;Fierce and Fearless Award&quot; acceptance speech, in which Union admitted she once reveled &quot;in gossip and rumors,&quot; because Winfrey &quot;never heard anyone be that honest in public or private about the competition and fierce drive to be seen and succeed in Hollywood.&quot;

In February 2012, Union was identified as a suspicious person by airport security and subjected to a &quot;hair patdown.&quot; She tweeted a joke about the experience: &quot;Hopefully my weave doesn&#x27;t cause turbulence. It&#x27;s clearly very powerful.&quot;

Union ran in the Global Race for the Cure in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, June 2, 2012, in honor of her friend Kristen Martinez, who died from breast cancer. Union was present at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on August 23, 2013, and unveiled a limited-edition 1963 March on Washington stamp to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the march.

In 2008, Union supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign. After working on the unsuccessful pilot for &quot;Army Wives&quot;, Union was appointed by President Obama to work with the National Advisory Committee for Violence Against Women. Obama contacted her specifically after learning that the pilot had fallen through. Union participated in the Obama campaign&#x27;s &quot;Greater Together&quot; initiative as part of his re-election campaign in 2012.

Union said that when she got divorced she &quot;sort of realized that she hadn&#x27;t been making sound choices which were the best for her to pursue her hopes and dreams and aspirations and passions.&quot; In a 2014 interview, Union stated that she may have rushed into the relationship for the wrong reasons, noting that, &quot;In my 20s, I was all about getting the ring&quot;. Union had earlier reflected that she spent much of the marriage &quot;upset&quot;, and from the relationship she realized that the men in her life were &quot;just human&quot;.

<doc id="619688" wikidata="Q1740744" url="?curid=619688" title="Thriller – A Cruel Picture">
<text>Thriller – A Cruel Picture () is a 1973 Swedish rape-and-revenge exploitation film written and directed by Bo Arne Vibenius under the pseudonym Alex Fridolinski, and starring Christina Lindberg and Heinz Hopf. It tells the story of a mute young woman who is forced into heroin addiction and prostitution, and her subsequent revenge on the men responsible.

The film was released in the United States in a truncated version by American International Pictures under several alternative titles, such as They Call Her One Eye, Hooker&#x27;s Revenge and The Swedish Vice-Girl.

== Plot ==
A quiet girl, Madeleine, is sexually abused as a child, and the trauma makes her mute. Years later, while living on her parents&#x27; farm as a teenager, Madeleine misses the bus into town, and accepts a ride from a pimp named Tony. Tony takes the naive Madeleine out for lunch before bringing her back to his home, where he incapacitates her and repeatedly injects her with heroin, causing her to become addicted as a means of forcing her into prostitution.

To hide the fact that Madeleine was kidnapped, Tony writes hateful letters to her parents, signing them with Madeleine&#x27;s name. Her parents become so distraught over their daughter&#x27;s apparent betrayal that they commit suicide. When Madeleine initially refuses to have sex with a client, Tony beats her before cutting out her eyeball with a scalpel. Donning an eyepatch over her extracted eye, Madeleine is subjected to a never-ending series of demoralizing sexual encounters with both male and female clients. Defeated by the state of her life, Madeleine is inspired by one of Tony&#x27;s other prostitutes, Sally, to create an escape plan for herself.

Madeleine begins covertly stashing some of her earnings, and takes lessons in driving, shooting, and martial arts, all unbeknownst to Tony. Using the money she has stashed away, Madeleine purchases a car, as well as a variety of weapons—including a sawed-off shotgun—that she stores in a shed she has rented in the countryside. One night, she discovers that Tony has murdered Sally, and finds Sally&#x27;s bed soaked with blood.

Finally at her breaking point, Madeleine begins to dispatch the clients who have abused her, first stalking one of the men, and shooting him to death with her shotgun on his front doorstep. Next, Madeleine locates another john dining at a restaurant with one of Madeleine&#x27;s female clients, who regularly physically abused her, and shoots them both to death. She next travels to a warehouse on an ocean dock where she finds two other male abusers, and kills them as well. Police arrive at the warehouse and find Madeleine seated with her shotgun. When they attempt to arrest her, she uses her martial arts training to incapacitate both officers and break free.

Madeleine absconds with the police car, and flees to a rural fishing village, causing a series of reckless and fatal car accidents in her wake. She is pursued by both Tony and police, and engages in a shootout in the village before fleeing back into the countryside, where she waits along a stone wall. Tony arrives and feigns sympathy, pretending he will reason with her. At his insistence, Madeleine puts down her shotgun, after which Tony threatens to shoot her with a pistol; before he can, however, she triggers a booby trap to distract him, and shoots him in both knees, incapacitating him. She proceeds to bind him with rope, and drags him to a meadow using a horse. There, she buries his body with stones, leaving only his head above ground, and ties a rope around his neck, which she tethers to the horse. Madeliene sits calmly and watches as Tony is strangled to death. Once he dies, she drives away in the police car.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

Director Bo Arne Vibenius sought to make &quot;the most commercial film ever made&quot;, as he had lost money on an earlier film, and needed to recoup his loss. Lindberg confirmed in interviews that the filmmakers used the actual corpse of a woman who had committed suicide&lt; during the film&#x27;s eye gouging scene, a revelation that sparked controversy. Hardcore pornographic sequences, in particular shots of unsimulated sex, were edited into the scenes in which the protagonist is raped, in order to capitalize on the trend of pornography in Denmark and Sweden, which was being liberalized at the time.

In Daniel Ekeroth&#x27;s book on Swedish exploitation movies, &quot;Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema&quot;, it is revealed that the producers took out a huge life insurance policy on star Christina Lindberg, as real ammunition was used in the action sequences, and that she was asked to inject saline solution during the heroin-use scenes.

== Release ==
===Censorship and distribution===
The original running time was 107 minutes. After being banned by the Swedish film censorship board, the film was truncated to 104 minutes and then 86 minutes, but still banned. It was finally released after being cut down to 82 minutes. In the United States, the film was distributed by American International Pictures, also in a truncated cut running 82 minutes. American International Pictures released the film in mid-1974 under the alternate titles &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;They Call Her One Eye&quot;, and, in 1975, as &quot;Hooker&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

===Critical response===

&quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film three out of four stars, writing, &quot;Not for the fainthearted, or the easily bored, this brutal and depressing film nevertheless is not easily forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Time Out&quot; gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film&#x27;s overuse of slow motion, hardcore scenes, and soundtrack, stating that it fails to leave the lingering emotional impact of its convictions. A.H. Weiler from &quot;The New York Times&quot; offered the film similar criticism, calling it &quot;dreary&quot;, and cited Lindberg as the film&#x27;s only notable aspect.

===Home media===
Synapse Films released &quot;Thriller – A Cruel Picture&quot; on DVD in October 2004 in a limited edition featuring the extended 107-minute cut. In 2005, Synapse released the shorter U.S. version as a standalone DVD, deeming it the &quot;Vengeance Edition&quot;. On May 31, 2022, Vinegar Syndrome released the film in a 4-disc 4K UHD and Blu-ray combination set limited to 10,000 units. This edition features the original 108-minute cut, as well as an exclusive UHD of the 90-minute English-language version entitled &quot;They Call Her One Eye&quot;. After the limited edition set sold out in late-May 2022, Vinegar Syndrome made a standard edition 4K UHD and Blu-ray set available (also featuring the &quot;They Call Her One Eye&quot; cut, but only on Blu-ray).

== Legacy ==

&quot;Thriller – A Cruel Picture&quot; was marketed as the first film ever to be completely banned in Sweden, although the first one actually was Victor Sjöström&#x27;s &quot;The Gardener&quot; from 1912. It has developed a cult following being a pioneer of the rape &#x27;n&#x27; revenge subgenre (a long time before Meir Zarchi&#x27;s &quot;I Spit on your Grave&quot;) and the B movies about female vengeance that were made through the 70s and 80s decades, and also as the basis behind Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot; character Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).

<text>Track &amp; Field, also known as in Japan and Europe, is an Olympic-themed sports video game developed by Konami and released as an arcade video game in 1983. The Japanese release featured an official license for the 1984 Summer Olympics. In Europe, the game was initially released under the Japanese title &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; in 1983, before being re-released under the US title &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; in early 1984.

Players compete in a series of events, most involving alternately pressing two buttons as quickly as possible to make the onscreen character run faster. The game uses a horizontal side-scrolling format, displaying one or two tracks at a time, a large scoreboard that shows world records and current attempts, and a packed audience in the background.

The game was a worldwide commercial success in arcades, becoming one of the most successful arcade games of 1984. Konami and Centuri also organized a 1984 &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; video game competition that attracted more than a million players internationally, holding the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time . It was followed by sequels, including &quot;Hyper Sports&quot;, as well as similar Olympic video games from other companies. The game&#x27;s popularity led to a resurgence in arcade sports games and inspired Namco&#x27;s side-scrolling platform game &quot;Pac-Land&quot; (1984).

==Gameplay==
In the original arcade game, the player uses two &quot;run&quot; buttons (or a trackball in later units that replaced buttons damaged from overuse) and one &quot;action&quot; button to control an athlete competing in the following six events: 
* 100 meter dash – running by quickly alternating button presses.
* Long jump – running by alternating button press and correct timing for jump hold jump button to set angle (42 degrees is optimal).
* Javelin throw – running by alternating button presses and then using action button correct timing for angle (43 degrees is optimal).
* 110 meter hurdles – running by alternating button presses and using action button to time jumps.
* Hammer throw – spinning initiated by pressing a run button once and then correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 degrees is optimal).
* High jump – running (speed set by computer) and then action button must be held down to determine angle of jump once in the air, the run button can be rapidly pressed for additional height.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. Failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three attempts in the other events) will reduce the player&#x27;s number of lives by one. If the player has no lives remaining, the game will end. Players can earn extra lives for every 100,000 points scored.

The game can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs for the running events and individually for the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are filled by the computer (or player &quot;CPU&quot;). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performances of the players do not affect the game; advancing is based solely on qualifying times. While most multiplayer arcade games have their controls arranged from left to right for the players, this game, which features two sets of controls, has a somewhat different setup. The left set of controls is designated for players 2 and 4, while the right set is for players 1 and 3. This is one of the few classic arcade games where single-player mode is played using the right set of controls rather than the left. If a player completes all six events, they are sent back to the field for another round, with higher qualifying levels; however, the game can be configured to conclude after the final event.

Due to the game&#x27;s response to rapidly pressing the &quot;run&quot; buttons, players of the arcade version resorted to various tricks, such as quickly swiping a coin or ping-pong ball over the buttons or using a metal ruler that was repeatedly struck to create vibrations that would press the buttons. As a result, arcade operators reported high rates of damage to the buttons, leading to modifications in later versions to prevent such actions.

==Release==
&quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; was introduced at Tokyo&#x27;s Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in September 1983. Despite the anticipation surrounding laserdisc games prior to the event, &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; emerged as the most well-received game at the show. According to &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine, several attendees noted &quot;cursory similarities&quot; to &quot;Activision Decathlon&quot;, which had been introduced a month earlier. &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; was licensed to Centuri for North American distribution. However, Atari was selected as the official sponsor for the Olympic video game, preventing Centuri from retaining the title &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot;. The game was subsequently introduced in North America as &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in October 1983. Despite the initial hype surrounding laserdisc games, many operators and distributors ultimately regarded &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; as the biggest hit at the event.

===Ports===
Konami licensed the North American home video game rights to Atari, Inc.. They initially ported &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; to the Atari 2600 console and the Atari 8-bit computers, followed by versions for the Apple II and the Commodore 64 under the Atarisoft label. A port for the Atari 5200, which would have been identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was canceled. The 2600 version was among the new games to utilize Atari&#x27;s &quot;super chip&quot; technology, enabling enhanced graphics and gameplay variety compared to what was previously possible on the 2600.

When Konami ported &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; to the Famicom (as &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot;), they included only four out of six events. They later converted &quot;Hyper Sports&quot; to the Famicom as well, this time incorporating three of the &quot;Hyper Sports&quot; events along with one additional event from &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;. By the time the NES gained popularity in the United States, Konami retooled the game for American release by including all eight events from both games in one cartridge. Of the original six events from &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, only the hammer throw is missing; in its place, however, are skeet shooting, archery, and triple jump.

The ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were released only as part of the &quot;Game, Set and Match II&quot; compilation in 1988 and are poorly regarded.

The NES version of &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; was re-released in Europe in 1992 as &quot;Track &amp; Field in Barcelona&quot; by Kemco in light of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The opening song for the NES version is the &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; theme by Vangelis (which was also used in the arcade version&#x27;s high score screen).

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; as the top-grossing new table arcade cabinet in December 1983, and it remained the top-grossing table cabinet in January 1984. The game sold 38,000 arcade hardware units in Japan by the end of 1983. &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; was also a hit in North America. Despite requiring physical interaction from players, the game continued to enjoy success in North America throughout the first half of 1984. It topped the US &quot;RePlay&quot; upright arcade cabinet charts in February 1984 and May 1984, and was the top-grossing arcade game of June 1984. It went on to become the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. In Europe, it was the highest-grossing arcade game of 1984 in the United Kingdom.

The arcade game received positive reviews upon its release. Gene Lewin of &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine scored it 8 out of 10, stating that it would be &quot;a definite 10&quot; if released as a more affordable conversion kit. The review praised it as the best dedicated arcade game at the AMOA 1983 show, highlighting the gameplay, &quot;excellent&quot; graphics, &quot;fantastic&quot; sound, and originality, noting that having &quot;different track and field events is an original idea&quot; and &quot;certainly different&quot; than the other sports games based on baseball, football, or basketball. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; referred to it as a &quot;great game for all you armchair sports enthusiasts,&quot; although they cautioned it could lead to cramped fingers.

Reviews for the home conversions varied by platform. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; reviewed the Atari 2600 version in 1984, scoring it 7 out of 8 stars. David M. Wilson and Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the home computer conversions for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, stating that &quot;the game is primarily a joystick buster.&quot; However, Stuart Campbell, writing in &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; in 1992, considered the Spectrum version to be one of the worst games ever released for that machine.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine ranked the &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; series collectively as number 78 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; They noted that while the gameplay may not accurately reflect skill or knowledge of the actual sports, the game&#x27;s appeal lies in its pure button-pushing endurance, particularly when played with four players. Additionally, in 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine placed the arcade version at 65th in its own &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list, further solidifying its status as a classic in the gaming community.

==Competition==
In 1984, Konami and Centuri jointly organized an international &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; video game competition that attracted over a million players from Japan and North America. This event was hailed by &quot;Play Meter&quot; as &quot;the coin-op event of the year,&quot; marking an unprecedented scale in the video game industry at that time. As of 2016, it is recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest organized video game competition in history. The competition, officially known as the &quot;1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track &amp; Field Challenge,&quot; was highlighted in the &quot;Twin Galaxies&quot; publication, which noted that more than a million contestants participated between April 30 and May 26, aiming to be among three finalists who would travel to Japan to represent the USA. This event served as a fundraiser for the March of Dimes and was held in Aladdin&#x27;s Castle arcades and National Convenience Stores. Gary West from Oklahoma City emerged as the U.S. Finals winner, while Phil Britt from Riverside, California, claimed victory in the World Championship held in Tokyo on June 10, 1984.

On December 18, 2008, Héctor Rodriguez from California set a new world record score of 95,350 points. This score surpassed the previous record of 95,040 points set by Kelly Kobashigawa from Los Angeles on June 30, 1985, during the 1985 Video Game Masters Tournament in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
==Legacy==
===Impact===
While not the first Olympic track-and-field game (it was preceded by &quot;Olympic Decathlon&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Activision Decathlon&quot; in August 1983), &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; spawned other similar Olympic video games following its release. For example, Ocean Software developed a licensed adaptation for home computers titled &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; (1984). Epyx released its own multi-event collection with &quot;Summer Games&quot; and subsequently &quot;Summer Games II&quot;. Dinamic published &quot;Video Olimpic&quot; for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. Bandai&#x27;s entry was &quot;Stadium Events&quot; for the NES in 1986.

&quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; had a significant impact on the broader sports video game genre, leading to a resurgence of sports games in arcades during the 1980s. Following the release of &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, the arcade industry began producing sports games at levels not seen since the days of &quot;Pong&quot; and its clones nearly a decade earlier. Sports video games became increasingly popular after &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, with several successful arcade titles released in 1984, including Nintendo&#x27;s boxing game &quot;Punch-Out&quot;, the Nintendo VS. System titles &quot;Vs. Tennis&quot; and &quot;Vs. Baseball&quot;, Taito&#x27;s American football game &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; and golf game &quot;Birdie King II&quot;, and Data East&#x27;s &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot;.

Namco&#x27;s Yoshihiro Kishimoto cited &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; as the biggest influence on the side-scrolling platform game &quot;Pac-Land&quot; (1984). The game&#x27;s controls were heavily inspired by &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, which allowed players to become faster by rapidly tapping the button in succession; Kishimoto found the concept intriguing and believed it would help &quot;Pac-Land&quot; stand out among other games.

===Sequels===
Konami continued releasing games in the series:

<text>The Jerusalem Talmud (, often for short) or Palestinian Talmud, also known as the Talmud of the Land of Israel, is a collection of rabbinic notes on the second-century Jewish oral tradition known as the Mishnah. Naming this version of the Talmud after Palestine or the Land of Israelrather than Jerusalemis considered more accurate, as the text originated mainly from Galilee in Byzantine Palaestina Secunda rather than from Jerusalem, where no Jews were allowed to live at the time.

The Jerusalem Talmud predates its counterpart, the Babylonian Talmud (known in Hebrew as the ), by about a century. It was written primarily in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. It was compiled between the late fourth century to the first half of the fifth century. Both versions of the Talmud have two parts, the Mishnah (of which there is only one version), which was finalized by Judah ha-Nasi around the year 200 CE, and either the Babylonian or the Jerusalem Gemara. The Gemara is what differentiates the Jerusalem Talmud from its Babylonian counterpart. The Jerusalem Gemara contains the written discussions of generations of rabbis of the Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina at Tiberias and Caesarea.

==Name==
This version of the Talmud is frequently named the Jerusalem Talmud or the Palestinian Talmud. The latter name, after the region of Palestine – or the Land of Israel – is considered more accurate, as the text originated mainly from Galilee in Byzantine Palaestina Secunda rather than from Jerusalem, where no Jews lived at the time. The use of the parallel terms dates to the period of the geonim (6th–11th century CE), alongside other terms such as &quot;Talmud of the Land of Israel&quot;, &quot;Talmud of the West&quot;, and &quot;Talmud of the Western Lands&quot;.

==Origins and historical context ==
The Jerusalem Talmud probably originated in Tiberias in the School of Johanan bar Nappaha as a compilation of teachings of the schools of Tiberias, Caesarea, and Sepphoris. It is written largely in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, a Western Aramaic language that differs from its Babylonian counterpart.

This Talmud is a synopsis of the analysis of the Mishnah that was developed for nearly 200 years by the Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina (principally those of Tiberias and Caesarea). Because of their location, the sages of these Academies devoted considerable attention to the analysis of the agricultural laws of the Land of Israel.

== Manuscripts ==
The Leiden Jerusalem Talmud (Or. 4720) is today the only extant complete manuscript of the Jerusalem Talmud and available at Leiden University Libraries. It was copied in 1289 by Jehiel ben Jekuthiel Anav and shows elements of a later recension. The additions which are added in the biblical glosses of the Leiden manuscript do not appear in extant fragments of the same Talmudic tractates found in Yemen, additions which are now incorporated in every printed edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. These Yemenite fragments, a consequence of isolation the Yemenite community, are important as source material (as evidenced below).

The Leiden manuscript is important in that it preserves some earlier variants to textual readings, such as in Tractate &quot;Pesachim&quot; 10:3 (70a), which brings down the old Hebrew word for charoset (the sweet relish eaten at Passover), viz. &quot;dūkeh&quot; (), instead of &quot;rūbeh/rabah&quot; (), saying with a play on words: &quot;The members of Isse&#x27;s household would say in the name of Isse: Why is it called &quot;dūkeh&quot;? It is because she pounds [the spiced ingredients] with him.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;pound&quot; is &quot;dakh&quot; (), which rules out the spelling of &quot;rabah&quot; (), as found in the printed editions. Yemenite Jews still call it &quot;dūkeh&quot;.

Leiden University Libraries has digitised both volumes of the manuscript and made it available in its Digital Collections.

Among the Hebrew manuscripts held in the Vatican Library is a late 13th-century – early 14th-century copy of Tractate &quot;Sotah&quot; and the complete &quot;Zeraim&quot; for the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Vat. ebr.&quot; 133): &quot;Berakhot&quot;, &quot;Peah&quot;, &quot;Demai&quot;, &quot;Kilayim&quot;, &quot;Sheviit&quot;, &quot;Terumot&quot;, &quot;Maaserot&quot;, &quot;Maaser Sheni&quot;, &quot;Ḥallah&quot; and &quot;Orlah&quot; (without the Mishnah for the Tractates, excepting only the Mishnah to the 2nd chapter of Berakhot). L. Ginzberg printed variant readings from this manuscript on pp. 347–372 at the end of his &quot;Fragments of the Yerushalmi&quot; (New York 1909). Saul Lieberman printed variants at the end of his essay, &quot;ʿAl ha-Yerushalmi&quot; (Hebrew), Jerusalem 1929. Both editors noted that this manuscript is full of gross errors but also retains some valuable readings.

== Dating ==

=== Premodern estimates ===
Traditionally, the redaction of this Talmud was thought to have been brought to an abrupt end around 425, when Theodosius II suppressed the Nasi of the Sanhedrin and put an end to the practice of semikhah (formal scholarly ordination). The redaction of the Jerusalem Talmud was done to codify the laws of the Sanhedrin as the redaction of the Mishnah had similarly done during the time of Judah ha-Nasi. It was thought that the compilers of the Jerusalem Talmud worked to collect the rulings of the Sanhedrin and lacked the time to produce a work of the quality they had intended and that this is the reason why the Gemara do not comment upon the whole Mishnah, or that certain sections were lost.

=== Modern estimates ===
Current perspectives on the dating of the closure of the text of the Palestinian Talmud rely on an understanding of activity of rabbinic scholarship and literary production, identifying datable historical datapoints mentioned by the text, and its reliance on and citation by other datable (or roughly datable) texts. Broadly, the Palestinian Talmud is dated at some time from the second half of the fourth century to the first half of the fifth century.

Christine Hayes has argued that a lack of evidence for Amoraim activity in Syria Palaestina after the 370s implies that the text was closed by around 370. However, reference to historical events from around or even slightly after 370 may push the earliest possible date to the late 4th century. For example, the Roman general Ursicinus, who had a public role between 351 and 359, is mentioned several times in a legendary context, suggesting that these references are somewhat later than his public career. Furthermore, there is also a reference to the Persian campaign of the Roman emperor Julian from 363. While less clear, there is also confidence that the Roman official &quot;Proclus&quot; named by the Palestinian Talmud corresponds to a Roman official also named Proclus, who became the governor of Palestine around 380 and eventually climbed to the position of &quot;praefectus urbi Constantinopolis&quot; (Prefect of Constantinople) which he held between 388–392. The final generation of rabbis whose opinions are found in the text belong to the second half of the fourth century. The time of the editing and compilation of these opinions would likely have occurred in the generation of their disciples, again leading to a date of the text during the late fourth or the early fifth century.

The dating of the Palestinian Talmud is definitively prior to that of the Babylonian Talmud, which relies heavily on it. The Babylonian Talmud was composed at some time between the mid-sixth century to the early-seventh century, but prior to the onset of the Arab conquests. This provides an upper absolute boundary as to when the Palestinian Talmud could have been compiled. To further push down the upper boundary, some lines (&quot;Demai&quot; 2:1; &quot;Shevi&#x27;it&quot; 6:1) of the Palestinian Talmud are also extant in the Tel Rehov inscription which dates to the 6th or 7th century.

==Contents and pagination==

In the initial Venice edition, the Jerusalem Talmud was published in four volumes, corresponding to separate &quot;sedarim&quot; of the Mishnah. Page numbers are by volume as follows:

# Zeraim: Berakhot (2a–14d); Pe&#x27;ah (15a–21b); Demai (21c–26c); Kilayim (26d–32d); Sheviit (33a–39d); Terumot (40a–48b); Maasrot (48c–52a); Maaser Sheni (52b–58d); Hallah (57a–60b); Orlah (60c–63b); Bikkurim (63c–65d).
# Moed: Shabbat (2a–18a); Eruvin (18a–26d); Pesachim (27a–37d); Yoma (38a–45c); Shekalim (45c–51b); Sukkah (51c–55d); Rosh ha-Shanah (56a–59d); Beẓah (59d–63b), Ta&#x27;anit (63c–69c); Megillah (69d–75d); Ḥagigah (75d–79d); Mo&#x27;ed Ḳaṭan (80a–83d).
# Nashim: Yebamot (2a–15a); Sotah (15a–24c); Ketuvot (24c–36b); Nedarim (36c–42d); Gittin (43a–50d); Nazir (51a–58a); Kiddushin (58a–66d).
# Nezikin (and Tohorot): Bava Kamma (2a–7c); Bava Metziah (7c–12c); Bava Batra (12d–17d); Sanhedrin (17d–30c); Makkot (30d–32b); Shevuot (32c–38d); Avodah Zarah (39a–45b); Horayot (45c–48c); Niddah (48d–51b).

Each page was printed as a folio, thus it contains four sub-pages (i.e., 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d), in contrast to the Babylonian Talmud which only has two sub-pages (7a, 7b).

In addition, each chapter of the Jerusalem Talmud (paralleling a chapter of Mishnah) is divided into &quot;halachot&quot;; each &quot;halacha&quot; is the commentary on a single short passage of Mishnah. Passages in the Jerusalem Talmud are generally references by a combination of chapter and halacha (i.e., Yerushalmi Sotah 1:1), by a page in the Venice edition (i.e., Yerushalmi Sotah 15a), or both (Yerushalmi Sotah 1:1 15a).

===Missing sections===

In addition to the &quot;sedarim&quot; of Tohorot (except part of Niddah) and Kodashim, several tractates and parts of tractates are missing from the Jerusalem Talmud. The last four chapters of Shabbat, and the last chapter of Makkot, are missing. Niddah ends abruptly after the first lines of chapter 4. Tractates Avot and Eduyot are missing from both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. Tractate Shekalim from the Jerusalem Talmud is printed in printings of both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmud.

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;,
===Missing passages===
Occasionally, the rishonim quote passages from the &quot;Yerushalmi&quot; which are not found in extant versions of the Jerusalem Talmud.
Proposed explanations for this include the following:
* The current Jerusalem Talmud has been truncated from its original version by the scribes who copied it.
* For these &quot;rishonim&quot;, &quot;Yerushalmi&quot; was a collective term which included any work of midrash from the Land of Israel, and not necessarily a reference to the Jerusalem Talmud proper.
* A separate text, summarizing the Jerusalem Talmud, was composed at some stage and the &quot;rishonim&quot; quote this work rather than the Jerusalem Talmud proper.

== Comparison to Babylonian Talmud ==
There are significant differences between the two Talmud compilations. The language of the Jerusalem Talmud is Jewish Aramaic, a Western Aramaic dialect which differs from that of the Babylonian.

The Jerusalem Talmud is often fragmentary and difficult to read, even for experienced Talmudists. The redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, is more careful and precise. The traditional explanation for this difference was the idea that the redactors of the Jerusalem Talmud had to finish their work abruptly. A more probable explanation is the fact that the Babylonian Talmud was not redacted for at least another 200 years, in which a broad discursive framework was created. In a novel view, David Weiss Halivni describes the longer discursive passages in the Babylonian Talmud as the &quot;Stammaitic&quot; layer of redaction, and believe that it was added later than the rest: if one were to remove the &quot;Stammaitic&quot; passages, the remaining text would be quite similar in character to the Jerusalem Talmud.

The two compilations are similar in examining the Mishnah according to rabbinic tradition, but numerous differences exist in the details in their interpretations. Such differences are listed and examined in depth in the modern works &quot;Amrei Bemaarava&quot; and &quot;Darkhei Hatalmudim&quot;.

Neither the Jerusalem nor the Babylonian Talmud covers the entire Mishnah: for example, a Babylonian Gemara exists only for 37 out of the 63 tractates of the Mishnah. In particular:
* The Jerusalem Talmud covers all the tractates of Zeraim, while the Babylonian Talmud covers only tractate Berachot. The reason might be that most laws from the Orders Zeraim (agricultural laws limited to the land of Israel) had little practical relevance in Babylonia and were therefore not included. The Jerusalem Talmud has a greater focus on the Land of Israel and the Torah&#x27;s agricultural laws pertaining to the land because it was written in the Land of Israel where the laws applied.
* The Jerusalem Talmud does not cover the Mishnaic order of Kodashim, which deals with sacrificial rites and laws pertaining to the Temple, while the Babylonian Talmud does cover it. It is not clear why this is, as the laws were not directly applicable in either country following the Temple&#x27;s 70 CE destruction.
* In both Talmuds, only one tractate (Niddah) from the order of Tohorot is examined, since the other tractates deal exclusively with Temple-related laws of ritual purity.

The Babylonian Talmud records the opinions of the rabbis of Israel as well as of those of Babylonia, while the Jerusalem Talmud seldom cites the Babylonian rabbis. The Babylonian version contains the opinions of more generations because of its later date of completion. For both these reasons, it is regarded as a more comprehensive collection of the opinions available. On the other hand, because of the centuries of redaction between the composition of the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmud, the opinions of early amoraim might be closer to their original form in the Jerusalem Talmud.

== Influence ==
The Jerusalem Talmud, and other classical rabbinic sources from the Land of Israel, strongly influenced Jewish practice there and in lands further west for many centuries, even forming the basis of many customs of early Ashkenaz. This influence is attested to in the works of Pirqoi ben Baboi (8th-9th century) and Sherira Gaon (10th century). Some traditions associated with the Jerusalem Talmud have been retained to this day, for example in the liturgy of the Italian Jews and Romaniotes.

In time, though, the Babylonian Talmud came to be seen as the canonical work of rabbinic tradition across the entire Jewish world. As such, the Babylonian Talmud has traditionally been studied more widely and has had a greater influence on the halakhic tradition than the Jerusalem Talmud. Already in the 11th century, the great works of Rashi and Isaac Alfasi were based on the Babylonian Talmud, not the Jerusalem Talmud. The shift to Babylonian authority occurred mainly because the influence and prestige of the Jewish community of Israel steadily declined in contrast with the Babylonian community in the years after the redaction of the Talmud and continuing until the Gaonic era. Furthermore, the editing of the Babylonian Talmud was superior to that of the Jerusalem version, making it more accessible and readily usable. Hai ben Sherira, on the preeminence of the Babylonian Talmud, wrote:
Nevertheless, the Jerusalem Talmud was still accorded a certain status as a secondary work useful for the clarification of halakha. Regarding the Jerusalem Talmud&#x27;s continued importance for the understanding of arcane matters, Hai ben Sherira wrote:
A similar judgment was made by Ritva: &quot;We always rely on their Talmud (i.e. the Jerusalem Talmud) and interpret and codify our Talmud (the Babylonian) based on their (the scholars of Yerushalmi) words.&quot;

It was also an important resource in the study of the Babylonian Talmud by the Kairouan school of Chananel ben Chushiel and Nissim ben Jacob, with the result that opinions ultimately based on the Jerusalem Talmud found their way into both the Tosafot and the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides.

Following the formation of the modern state of Israel, there was some interest in restoring Jerusalem Talmud&#x27;s traditions. For example, David Bar-Hayim of the Machon Shilo institute has issued a siddur reflecting the practices found in the Jerusalem Talmud and other sources. In addition, from a historical perspective, the Jerusalem Talmud remains an indispensable source of knowledge of the development of the Jewish Law in the Holy Land.

== Commentators ==
There is no comprehensive commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud by any of the Rishonim, but explanations of many individual passages can be found in the literature of the Rishonim. Most significantly, Rabbi Samson ben Abraham of Sens (c. 1150 – c. 1230), known as the &quot;Rash&quot;, excerpts and explains many sections of the Jerusalem Talmud in his commentary to the Mishnah of Seder Zeraim. His work, however, is focused on the Mishnah and is not a comprehensive commentary on the entire Jerusalem Talmud.

Judah ben Yakar (died c.1210) wrote a commentary to much of the Jerusalem Talmud, which was quoted by other rishonim but has now been lost.

&quot;Kaftor VaFerach&quot;, by Rabbi Ishtori Haparchi (1280–1355), a disciple of Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel, the &quot;Rosh&quot;, is one of the few surviving compositions of the Rishonim about all of Seder &quot;Zeraim&quot;. However it is a Halachic work and not per se a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud.

The only surviving commentaries of Rishonim on the Jerusalem Talmud are the commentaries to Tractate Shekalim of Menachem Meiri, Meshulam ben David and Shemuel ben Shniur. All three of these commentaries are reprinted in the Mutzal Mi&#x27;Eish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud Tractate Shekalim.

Many Acharonim, however, wrote commentaries on all or major portions of the Jerusalem Talmud, and as with the Babylonian Talmud, many also wrote on individual tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud.

One of the first of the Acharonim to write a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud was Solomon Sirilio (1485–1554), also known as &quot;Rash Sirilio&quot;, whose commentaries cover only the Seder Zeraim and the tractate Shekalim of Seder Moed. Sirilio&#x27;s commentary remained in manuscript form until it was first printed in 1875. In the Vilna edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, &quot;Rash Sirilio&quot; appears only for tractates Berakhot and Pe&#x27;ah, but the commentary for the entire Seder Zeraim appears in the Mutzal Mi&#x27;Eish and Oz Vehadar editions. In addition to his commentary, Sirilio worked to remove mistakes made by manuscript copyists that over time had slipped into the text of the Jerusalem Talmud, and his amended text of the Gemara is reproduced alongside his commentary in the Vilna and Mutzal Mi&#x27;Eish editions.

Another 16th century commentary on the Yerushalmi is Rabbi Elazar ben Moshe Azikri&#x27;s commentary to Tractates Berakhot and Betzah. 

Today&#x27;s modern printed editions almost all carry the commentaries, &quot;Korban ha-Eida&quot;, by David ben Naphtali Fränkel (c. 1704–1762) of Berlin on the orders of Moed, Nashim and parts of Nezikin, and &quot;Pnei Moshe&quot;, by Moses Margolies (c.1710?–1781) of Amsterdam on the entire Talmud. The Vilna edition also includes the Ridvaz by Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky on most of the Talmud. The goal of all three of these commentaries is to explain the simple meaning of the Talmud similar to Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Bavli, and the authors each wrote an additional commentary—Sheyarei ha-Korban, Marei ha-Panim and Tosefot Rid respectively—that is meant to be a similar style to Tosafot.

Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky published a commentary on tractates Berakhot through Nedarim (roughly 70% of the Jerusalem Talmud), considered by many to be the clearest commentary. Most of it is reprinted in the Oz Vehadar edition of the Yerushalmi. Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Krasilschikov wrote the Toledot Yitzchak and Tevuna commentaries on tractates Berakhot through Rosh Hashanah (roughly 50% of the Jerusalem Talmud), which was published from his manuscript by the Mutzal Me-esh Institute.

A modern edition and commentary, known as &quot;Or Simchah&quot;, is currently being prepared in Arad; another edition in preparation, including paraphrases and explanatory notes in modern Hebrew, is &quot;Yedid Nefesh&quot;. The Jerusalem Talmud has also received some attention from Adin Steinsaltz, who planned a translation into modern Hebrew and accompanying explanation similar to his work on the Babylonian Talmud before his death. So far only Tractates Pe&#x27;ah and Shekalim have appeared.

== Translations into English ==
* The first volume, Berakhoth, was translated into English in 1886 by Dr. Moses Schwab, under the title &quot;The Talmud of Jerusalem&quot; . The author has an earlier translation into French, which covers many more volumes.
*&quot;Talmud of the Land of Israel: A Preliminary Translation and Explanation&quot; Jacob Neusner, Tzvee Zahavy, others. University of Chicago Press. This translation uses a form-analytical presentation that makes the logical units of discourse easier to identify and follow. Neusner&#x27;s mentor Saul Lieberman, then the most prominent Talmudic scholar alive, read one volume shortly before his death and wrote a review, published posthumously, in which he describes dozens of major translation errors in the first chapter of that volume alone, also demonstrating that Neusner had not, as claimed, made use of manuscript evidence; he was &quot;stunned by Neusner&#x27;s ignorance of rabbinic Hebrew, of Aramaic grammar, and above all the subject matter with which he deals&quot; and concluded that &quot;the right place for [Neusner&#x27;s translation] is the wastebasket&quot;. This review was devastating for Neusner&#x27;s career. At a meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature a few months later, during a plenary session designed to honor Neusner for his achievements, Morton Smith (also Neusner&#x27;s mentor) took to the lectern and announced that &quot;I now find it my duty to warn&quot; that the translation &quot;cannot be safely used, and had better not be used at all&quot;. He also called Neusner&#x27;s translation &quot;a serious misfortune for Jewish studies&quot;.

<doc id="619700" wikidata="Q4971082" url="?curid=619700" title="British South American Airways">
<text>British South American Airways (BSAA) was a state-run airline of the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1940s responsible for services to the Caribbean and South America. Originally named British Latin American Air Lines, it was renamed before services started in 1946. BSAA operated mostly Avro aircraft: Yorks, Lancastrians and Tudors and flew to Bermuda, the West Indies, Mexico and the western coast of South America. After two high-profile aircraft disappearances it was merged into the British Overseas Airways Corporation at the end of 1949.

Most of BSAA&#x27;s aircraft were given individual aircraft names beginning with &quot;Star&quot;, which have long been used in long-range celestial navigation.

==History==
British Latin American Air Lines (BLAIR) was formed on 25 January 1944 by shipping interests (Royal Mail Lines, Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Lamport &amp; Holt Line, Booth Steamship Company and Blue Star Line) to complement the companies&#x27; shipping services to South America; at the end of 1945 the company was renamed British South American Airways. The chairman of the new company was J W Booth. The initial aircraft – until the Avro Tudor II was available – would be Avro Lancasters converted by Avro into the same configuration as Avro Lancastrians and the crews were being sought from former Pathfinder Force members: the general manager Don Bennett had been the force commander during the war. The single route to be flown was Hurn-Lisbon-Bathurst-Natal-Rio de Janeiro-Montevideo-Buenos Aires.

On 1 January 1946, the airline&#x27;s first Avro Lancastrian, &quot;Star Light&quot;, flown by Don Bennett and R. Clifford Alabaster, undertook the first flight from the newly opened Heathrow Airport; it was on a proving flight to South America. The first commercial flight followed ten weeks later. With the approaching nationalisation of British airlines, the airline came under the control of the British Overseas Airways Corporation and with the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1946 – which set up three nationally owned corporations – BSAA became a government-owned corporation on 1 August 1946 charged with developing services from the UK to South America. This responsibility was then expanded later in 1946 to routes to the West Indies, Central America and the west coast of South America.

In January 1947 the airline reached an agreement with British West Indian Airways which would become an associate. BSAA would buy the majority of shares in BWIA and provide technical advice and general supervision. In May 1947 the airline started a series of test flights to Bermuda using a converted Avro Lancaster which was refuelled in mid-air over the Azores to complete the flight in 20 hours. On 2 August 1947, Avro Lancastrian &quot;Star Dust&quot; crashed in Argentina with the loss of all on board. In the first financial year under government control (August 1946 – March 1947) the airline made a surplus of £20,507. The two other airline corporations BOAC and BEA made a combined loss of £10,234,781. On 31 March 1947 the corporation had a staff of 1,031 and had carried 5,397 passengers since August 1946. For navigation purposes, the Lancastrians and Yorks were using military Gee radar over Europe, and Rebecca on the other side of the Atlantic.

On 30 January 1948, Avro Tudor &quot;Star Tiger&quot;, with a crew of six and 25 passengers bound for Bermuda, disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean. The remaining Tudors were grounded while an investigation was undertaken. In February the chief executive, Don Bennett, was dismissed by the board. In March the Tudor aircraft were again allowed to fly, initially only as freighters. In the financial year April 1947 – March 1948, the Corporation made a loss of £421,481. The Tudor returned to passenger service on 18 August, with a new service to Kingston, Jamaica. In December the Tudors replaced the Avro Lancastrian on routes to Havana, Cuba, and to the west coast of South America. From September 1948 the airline based Avro Tudors at Wunstorf to support the Berlin Airlift, mainly by each carrying 2,300 gallons of petrol or 2,100 gallons of fuel oil; by April 1949 the airline had five aircraft operating the Airlift. By December 1948 the airline had transported over 1,000,000 gallons of petrol into Berlin from Wunstorf in over 700 flights, using mostly Tudor V tankers, each fitted with five tanks.

The airline acquired Bahamas Airways in January 1949; along with British West Indian Airways, it was to be used as a feeder airline for BSAA services in the Caribbean. On 17 January, in a repeat of the &quot;Star Tiger&quot; incident, the Tudor &quot;Star Ariel&quot; disappeared over the Atlantic on a flight from Bermuda. It had seven crew and 13 passengers. Pending investigation, the Tudors were withdrawn from service by the airline. By March 1949, with the loss of the &quot;Star Ariel&quot; unexplained, the permanent grounding of the Tudor IVs for passenger flying, and the lack of other long-range aircraft, the government proposed amalgamating the airline with BOAC. BSAA passengers to Bermuda were already being carried by BOAC aircraft via New York. The airline did have Saunders-Roe Princess flying-boats on order, but they would not be delivered until 1951, and the transfer of Canadair North Star which were on order for BOAC was considered. On 15 March, the Minister of Civil Aviation announced that BSAA and BOAC would be amalgamated.

On the passing of the Air Corporations Act 1949, British South American Airways Corporation became the South American Division of BOAC; the change became effective from 1 January 1950.

==Bases==
The airline used Langley Airfield for maintenance before transferring all operations to London Heathrow Airport.

==&quot;Star Dust&quot;==

On 2 August 1947, the Avro Lancastrian &quot;Star Dust&quot; disappeared on a flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Santiago, Chile; fifty years later remains of the aircraft were found to have crashed into an Argentine mountain.

==&quot;Star Tiger&quot; and &quot;Star Ariel&quot;==
The &quot;Star Tiger&quot; and &quot;Star Ariel&quot; were Avro Tudor IV aircraft lost over the Atlantic. The loss of each without a trace, plus the unexplained disappearance of an Airport Transport DC-3 south of Miami on 27 December 1948, and the loss of United States Navy Flight 19 on 5 December 1945, led to the creation of the Bermuda Triangle myth.

Star Tiger

On 30 January 1948, &quot;Star Tiger&quot; was flying from England to Bermuda. It stopped for fuel in the Azores. Early on 31 January, the captain asked for a bearing for Bermuda. The request was routine, and there was no cause for alarm. He then gave an estimated arrival at 05:00; that was the last contact. The distance from the Azores to Bermuda is 2,230 miles (3,588 km). At 05:00 a search was launched from Bermuda, but the aircraft was not found.

Star Ariel

&quot;Star Ariel&quot; G-AGRE left Bermuda for Kingston, Jamaica, on 17 January 1949. Soon after take-off, captain John McPhee radioed a standard departure message including an estimate at Kingston of 14:10. This was followed by a position report: &quot;I was over 30° N at 9:37 I am changing frequency to MRX.&quot; &quot;Star Ariel&quot; was never heard from again. Over 70 aircraft and many ships, including the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and USS &quot;Leyte&quot;, and the battleship , searched as far as 500 miles south of Bermuda. No debris, oil slicks, or wreckage were found. The Tudor IV was later discontinued.

==Further accidents and incidents==
*7 September 1946: an Avro 685 York I registration G-AHEW named &quot;Star Leader&quot; flying from London to Buenos Aires via Lisbon, Bathurst (Banjul)-Jeshwang, Natal, Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and Montevideo lost control and crashed shortly after takeoff from Bathurst. The cause of the loss of control cannot be determined with certainty, but a mishandling of the controls by the captain is the most likely explanation. All 24 occupants died.
*30 August 1946: G-AGWJ swung off the runway on landing, and was written off
*13 April 1947: G-AHEZ crash-landed in poor visibility at Dakar Airport, killing 6
*5 January 1949: Avro York G-AHEX &quot;Star Venture&quot; suffered engine fire and crash-landed, killing 3 passengers

*BSAA Avro York G-AHFA &quot;Star Dale&quot; was sold to Skyways. It was lost on 2 February (1953 Skyways Avro York disappearance)

<text>Mary Moser (27 October 1744 – 2 May 1819) was an English painter and one of the most celebrated female artists of 18th-century Britain. One of only two female founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768 (along with Angelica Kauffman), Moser painted portraits but is particularly noted for her depictions of flowers.

==Life and career==
London-born Moser was trained by her Swiss-born artist and enameller father George Michael Moser (1706–1783), George III&#x27;s own drawing master. Her talents were evident at an early age: she won her first Society of Arts medal at 14, and regularly exhibited flower pieces, and occasional history paintings, at the Society of Artists of Great Britain. Ten years later, however, her thirst for professional recognition led her to join with 35 other artists (including her father) in forming the Royal Academy, and, with Angelica Kauffman, she took an active role in proceedings.


In a group portrait by Johan Zoffany, &quot;The Academicians of the Royal Academy&quot; (1771–72; Royal Collection, London), members are shown gathered around a nude male model at a time when women were excluded from such training in order to protect their modesty. So that Moser and Kauffman could be included, Zoffany added them as portraits hanging on the wall. They were both later included in the 1795 group painting &quot;The Royal Academicians in General Assembly&quot; by Henry Singleton.

George Romney (c. 1770) painted a portrait of Moser at work on a still life which was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery (London) in 2003.

Her influences include the older Dutch masters, famed for glowing color against dark backgrounds. From the beginning, her approach was &quot;bold and luxurious,&quot; writes Germaine Greer.

In the 1790s, Moser received a prestigious commission, for which she was paid over £900, from Queen Charlotte to complete a floral decorative scheme for a room in Frogmore House in Windsor, Berkshire.
This was to prove one of her last professional works. At 53, she married Captain Hugh Lloyd, the widower of a friend on 23 October 1793. She retired and began exhibiting as an amateur under her married name. She continued showing at the Royal Academy until 1802.

At this period Moser had a brief affair with artist Richard Cosway, who was then separated from his wife Maria Cosway, an Anglo-Italian artist. Moser travelled with him for six months on a sketching tour in 1793.

&quot;One of the most celebrated women artists of 18th-century Britain,&quot; Moser died in Upper Thornhaugh Street, London, on 2 May 1819, and was buried, alongside her husband in Kensington Cemetery.

Moser&#x27;s pieces in the British Royal Collection show that she was not only &quot;the first significant British flower painter, she was also one of the best.&quot; Her portrait of famed British sculptor Joseph Nollekens hangs in the Yale Center for British Art.

==Legacy==
No further women were elected as full members of the Academy until Dame Laura Knight in 1936.

<doc id="619726" wikidata="Q3033314" url="?curid=619726" title="Madras Bashai">
<text>Madras Bashai (Tamil: , ) is a variety of the Tamil language spoken by native people in the city of Chennai (then known as Madras) in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was sometimes considered a pidgin, as its vocabulary was heavily influenced by Hindustani, Indian English, Telugu, Malayalam, and Burmese; it is not mutually intelligible with any of those except for Tamil, to a certain extent.

Since the advent of urbanization of the city especially since the Indian Independence, due to large immigrations into the city from different parts of Tamil Nadu, the Madras Bashai variety has become closer to normalized standard spoken Tamil. Today, the transformed variety is majorly called as Chennai Tamil.

Madras Bashai evolved largely during the past three centuries. It grew in parallel with the growth of cosmopolitan Madras. After Madras Bashai became somewhat common in Madras, it became a source of satire for early Tamil films from the 1950s, in the form of puns and double entendres. Subsequent generations in Chennai identified with it and absorbed English constructs into the dialect, making it what it is today&#x27;s Chennai Tamil.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Madras Bhashai&quot; is a compound word, where &quot;Madrās&quot; is derived from the classical name of the city &quot;Madrāsapaṭnam&quot;, and &quot;bhāṣā&quot; is the Sanskrit word for &quot;language&quot;, nativized as &quot;bāṣai&quot;.

== Evolution ==

Madras Bashai evolved largely during the past three centuries. With its emergence as an important city in British India when they recovered it from the French and as the capital of Madras Presidency, the contact with western world increased and a number of English words crept into the vocabulary. Many of these words were introduced by educated, middle-class Tamil migrants to the city who borrowed freely from English for their daily usage. Due to the presence of a considerable population of Telugu, Hindi–Urdu and many other language-speakers, especially, the Gujaratis, Marwaris and some Muslim communities, some Hindustani and Telugu words, too, became a part of Madras Bashai. At the turn of the 20th century, though preferences have since shifted in favor of the Central and Madurai Tamil dialects, the English words introduced during the early 20th century have been retained.

Madras Bashai is generally considered a dialect of the working class like the Cockney dialect of English. Lyrics of &quot;gaana&quot; songs make heavy use of Madras Bashai.

== Vocabulary ==

A few words unique to Madras Bashai are given below; an Internet project, urban Tamil, has set out to collect urban Tamil vocabulary.

; Words borrowed from other languages

== In film ==

<text>Tangled is a 2010 American animated musical adventure fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Loosely based on the German fairy tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot; in the collection of folktales published by the Brothers Grimm, the film was directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, and produced by Roy Conli, from a screenplay written by Dan Fogelman. Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy, &quot;Tangled&quot; tells the story of Rapunzel, a lost young princess with magical long blonde hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower. She accepts the aid of an intruder, the outlaw Flynn Rider, to take her out into the world which she has never seen.

Originally conceived and proposed by Disney animator Glen Keane in 2001, &quot;Tangled&quot; spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated feature film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score &quot;Tangled&quot;, and also wrote the film&#x27;s songs with lyricist Glenn Slater. Before the film&#x27;s release, its title was changed from &quot;Rapunzel&quot; to &quot;Tangled&quot;, reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally.

&quot;Tangled&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue, $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2010. &quot;Tangled&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation, writing, characters, and musical score. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards. It was Richard Kiel&#x27;s last film role before his death in 2014. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 29, 2011; a short film, &quot;Tangled Ever After&quot;, was released later in 2012, and a television series aired from 2017 to 2020. A live-action remake is in development.

==Plot==

A drop of sunlight falls from the sky and produces a magic flower with healing properties. An old woman named Gothel uses it to retain her youth. Centuries later, the flower is taken by soldiers from the kingdom of Corona and used to save their ill, pregnant queen. She gives birth to Rapunzel, whose blonde hair contains the flower&#x27;s magic. Gothel sneaks into the castle and cuts a lock of her hair, but it turns brown and loses its magic. She instead kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods. Each year on Rapunzel&#x27;s birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns, hoping they will guide Rapunzel home.

Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks to leave the tower and investigate them, but Gothel refuses, claiming the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel&#x27;s intended crown from the palace; he betrays the Stabbington brothers, his partners in crime, while being pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus. Flynn discovers and takes refuge in the tower, where Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him. When Gothel berates Rapunzel for mentioning the lanterns again and refuses to let her ever leave the tower, Rapunzel hatches a new plan and asks Gothel for new paint as a gift, sending her on a three-day journey.

Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return the crown in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns. When they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides. When royal guards arrive, the thugs help Rapunzel and Flynn escape. Gothel returns to the empty tower and finds the crown and a wanted poster of Flynn. She strikes a deal with the Stabbington brothers to find Rapunzel. Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave; believing they will suffocate, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel uses the magic glow of her hair to reveal a hidden exit beneath the water, and they escape. That night, Gothel confronts Rapunzel alone and gives her the crown, telling her to give it to Eugene to test his loyalty.

The next morning, Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him, but Rapunzel convinces them to strike a truce. Rapunzel and Eugene enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the &quot;lost princess&quot;. After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their mutual love. When Eugene sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown. The brothers tie him up, tricking Rapunzel into thinking he abandoned her. They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a rescue by knocking them out and takes Rapunzel back to the tower.

Eugene is arrested, but Maximus and the pub thugs help him escape. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom&#x27;s standard, a golden sun, into her artwork throughout her life. Realizing that she is the &quot;lost princess&quot;, she confronts and rebels against Gothel. Eugene arrives at the tower, but is tricked and stabbed by Gothel. Gothel attempts to take the chained and gagged Rapunzel away, but she resists, and promises to stay with Gothel if she is allowed to heal the dying Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees to this, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off her long hair before she can heal him. Rapunzel&#x27;s hair turns from blonde to brown, and a horrified Gothel suddenly ages rapidly, then falls from the tower and turns to dust.

Rapunzel mourns Eugene, but one of her tears, which still has some of the flower&#x27;s magic, revives him. They return to Corona, where Rapunzel is reunited with her birth parents and the kingdom celebrates, with Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marrying.

==Production==
===Origins and conception===
The concept of an animated film based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot; originated from Disney supervising animator Glen Keane in 1996. In 2001, Keane pitched the idea to then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner who approved it, but requested the film to be computer-animated. However, Keane was hesitant as he felt computer animation was not quite as fluid or organic as traditional animation was. In October 2003, the film was announced as &quot;Rapunzel Unbraided&quot; as a computer-animated feature scheduled for a 2007 release, which Keane described as &quot;a &quot;Shrek&quot;-like version of the film&quot;. According to Ed Catmull, Eisner himself had proposed using modern-day San Francisco as the initial setting of the film. The story initially centered on two teenagers, Claire and Vince, who live in San Francisco and are transported into the fairy tale world, where they inhabit the bodies of Rapunzel and her prince Beau. Rapunzel and Beau themselves are turned into a squirrel and a dog. In July 2004, Reese Witherspoon and Kristin Chenoweth were in talks to portray roles, with the latter intended to voice Rapunzel. In October 2005, Dan Fogler was slated to provide a voice.

In reflection, Keane said of the original plot, &quot;It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale.&quot; In November 2005, &quot;Unbraided&quot; was pushed back to a summer 2009 release in order to give Keane &quot;more time to work on the story.&quot; In January 2006, the film was then shut down about a week before Catmull and John Lasseter were placed in charge of the studio, and one of their first decisions was to restart the project and ask Keane to keep going with the film. It had originally been announced in April 2007 that Annie-nominated animator and story artist Dean Wellins would be co-directing the film alongside Keane.

On October 9, 2008, it was reported that Keane and Wellins had stepped down as directors due to other commitments, and were replaced by the team of Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, director and storyboard director, respectively, of Disney&#x27;s 2008 animated feature &quot;Bolt&quot;. Keane stayed on as an executive producer and animation supervisor, while Wellins moved on to developing other short and feature films. After the film&#x27;s release, Keane revealed that he had &quot;stepped back&quot; from the role of director because of a heart attack in 2008.

===Casting===
The directors auditioned hundreds of young actresses to find Rapunzel&#x27;s voice, among them were Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, but both were rejected for not sounding right.

On September 10, 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter and actress Mandy Moore, who previously worked with Disney on Disneytoon Studios&#x27; &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;, had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel, and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider. For the role of Flynn, the studio mandated exclusively only UK actors to audition for the part, as Rider was intended to be British. An American, Zachary Levi, impersonated a British Received Pronunciation (RP) accent to audition, leading the producers to opt for him to use his natural American accent. Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning, when she heard that a film about the story of &quot;Rapunzel&quot; was being made. Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel, she had fulfilled her &quot;ultimate childhood dream&quot;. She described herself as a &quot;girly fan&quot; of Disney animated films like &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and that it was an honor for her to be part of this &quot;legacy&quot;—the lineage of such Disney icons. Since the film was going to be a musical, it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice, to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing. For this singing section, Moore chose &quot;Help Me&quot; by Joni Mitchell, a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album, &quot;Coverage&quot; (2003). Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions and described the experiences as &quot;pretty fun&quot; but didn&#x27;t put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role; she just performed her best without any anxiety. When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part, Moore described herself as being &quot;over the moon&quot;: &quot;I was working in New York at the time. I was with some friends and my husband—and I screamed as soon as I found out the news.&quot;

The film reportedly cost more than $260 million to produce.

===Writing and character development===
When asked about the character of Rapunzel, Mandy Moore said that Rapunzel was a relatable character and called her a &quot;Renaissance, bohemian&quot; woman rather than a typical Disney princess: Moore said &quot;[Rapunzel] doesn&#x27;t know she&#x27;s a princess [until the end of the film]. She&#x27;s just really sort of motivated to find out what else is out there beyond this crazy tower she&#x27;s lived in for 18 years,&quot; and that &quot;she&#x27;s very independent, she can take care of herself, and she&#x27;s definitely come up with really entertaining ways to keep herself busy.&quot; Moore also stated that she herself had little influence on Rapunzel: &quot;The character was developed way before I had anything to do with it.&quot;

According to Greno, one of the most difficult problems during the development of the film&#x27;s plot was how to get Rapunzel out of the tower without immediately ending the movie, in that she had thereby escaped Mother Gothel and did not have any other specific objectives to pursue. At a meeting one day, animator John Ripa floated an idea which turned out to be the solution they had been looking for: the mysterious floating lanterns.

===Recording===
In &quot;Tangled&quot;, as with most animated films, all voice actors had to record their dialogue separately from one another to avoid bleeding into each other&#x27;s tracks. Mandy Moore later recalled that during recording, she had never met Donna Murphy and only met Zachary Levi once when they recorded &quot;I See the Light&quot;. Moore thought that this was &quot;a good exercise in employing your imagination&quot;. When recording action scenes, the voice actors had to jog a little in place in order to make their voices sound realistic. For the songs, Moore and Levi recorded on a soundstage with a 65-piece orchestra under the supervision of composer Alan Menken. They sang live with the orchestra for several times in order to help everyone &quot;get a vibe&quot; and a feel for the music and the singing, then were asked to go in isolation booths to record the actual tracks. In order to aid animators in animating the characters, the filmmakers did interviews with the voice actors and filmed their facial expressions throughout the recording sessions. Disney animated films are usually animated to synchronize with recorded dialogue rather than asking the vocal talent to synchronize their delivery to animation after it is rendered. Thus, Moore felt that the recording process was challenging because at that time she had no animation to look at except for a few sketches.

Due to scheduling conflicts with other projects (Moore had to travel to different places such as London or New York, and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks), they did not record dialogue in the same order as in the final film. &quot;[When I came in], maybe that sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy (Moore) already, maybe it hadn&#x27;t. We&#x27;d end up doing the same scene five times, depending,&quot; Levi said. After watching the finished film, Moore was disappointed because she felt that her voice sounded &quot;shrill&quot;, while Levi thought that his performance sounded &quot;incredibly nasally&quot;.

===Animation===

The film was made using computer-generated imagery (CGI), although &quot;Tangled&quot; was modeled on the traditional look of oil paintings on canvas. The Rococo paintings of French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard, particularly &quot;The Swing&quot;, were used as references for the film&#x27;s artistic style, a style described by Keane as &quot;romantic and lush.&quot; To create the impression of a painting, non-photorealistic rendering was used.
Glen Keane originally wanted the film to be animated using a traditional 2D animation process. However, Disney executives David Stainton and Dick Cook announced that they would only approve the film for production if it were created using the 3D computer graphics. In response to that demand, Glen Keane held a seminar called &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, where he, with 50 Disney CGI artists and traditional artists, focused on the pros and cons of each style. After the meeting, it was decided that the film would be made in 3D CGI animation, but in a way as to become an extension of the traditional 2D Disney &quot;aesthetic&quot;, a term which referred to the naturalistic animation that conforms to the fundamental principles of animation as documented by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in the book &quot;The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation&quot;.

Due to limitations in computer technology, especially regarding attempts to capture the complexity of a human form, many basic principles of animation used in traditionally animated movies had been absent from earlier CGI films; but technological advancements made it easier to blend the two, combining the strengths of each style. Keane stated repeatedly he was trying to make the computer &quot;bend its knee to the artist&quot; instead of having the computer dictate the artistic style and look of the film. By making the computer become as &quot;pliable as the pencil&quot;, Keane&#x27;s vision of a &quot;three-dimensional drawing&quot; seemed within reach, with the artist controlling the technology. Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own. Keane said, &quot;There’s no photoreal hair. I want luscious hair, and we are inventing new ways of doing that. I want to bring the warmth and intuitive feel of hand-drawn to CGI.&quot;

One of the main goals of the animators was to create movement that mimicked the soft fluidity of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated films. Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style. &quot;He took the house from &quot;Snow White&quot; and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor. Kyle helped us get that Fragonard look of that girl on the swing… We are using subsurface scattering and global illumination and all of the latest techniques to pull off convincing human characters and rich environments.&quot;

Rather than focusing on realism, the 3D team used an aesthetic approach. Robert Newman, the film’s stereoscopic supervisor said that &quot;We’re using depth more artistically than ever before, and we’re not as concerned with the literal transcription of depth between camera and projector as we are the interpretation of it.&quot; To do this, they used a new technique called multi-rigging, which is made up of multiple pairs of virtual cameras. Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene, like background, foreground, and characters, without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs. When sandwiched together later in production, the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world, but which created an appealing look to the film.

As a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel, the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider &quot;the most handsome, most attractive male lead Disney has ever had.&quot; They held a large &quot;Hot Man Meeting&quot; where they gathered about 30 women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man. They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities, which were torn and pasted back again. After much deliberation, his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing.

====Technology development====
Existing technology continued to present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out to be a challenge. Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted. As late as January 2010, the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character&#x27;s length of hair was going to work. These problems were finally solved in March: An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for &quot;Bolt&quot;, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.

==== Controversy over the film title change ====

When first put into production, the film was promoted as having the title &quot;Rapunzel Unbraided&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;Rapunzel&quot;. Disney&#x27;s previous animated feature, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; (2009)—while being well received by various critics and taking in nearly $270 million worldwide—was not as successful as Disney had hoped, and Catmull later admitted in writing that Disney Animation&#x27;s faith that &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;″s excellent quality would bring in all audiences notwithstanding the word &quot;princess&quot; in the title was their version of &quot;a stupid pill&quot;. In order to market the new film to both sexes and additional age groups, Disney changed the title from &quot;Rapunzel&quot; to &quot;Tangled&quot; while also emphasizing Flynn Rider, the film&#x27;s prominent male character, showing that his story is just as important as that of Rapunzel. Disney was criticized for altering the title as a marketing strategy. Floyd Norman, a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist, said, &quot;The idea of changing the title of a classic like &quot;Rapunzel&quot; to &quot;Tangled&quot; is beyond stupid. I&#x27;m convinced they&#x27;ll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience.&quot;

Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; compared it to changing the title of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; to &quot;Beached&quot;. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s blog, Margot Magowan accused Disney of sexism, writing:

On November 24, 2010, the day of the film&#x27;s release, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed reports that the title change was a marketing decision. They said they changed the title from &quot;Rapunzel&quot; to &quot;Tangled&quot; because Rapunzel is not the only main character in the film. They went on to say that &quot;you cannot call &quot;Toy Story&quot; &quot;&quot;Buzz Lightyear&quot;,&quot; and they really needed a title that represented what the film is, and that it stars the duo of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.

In March 2014, executive producer John Lasseter explained that Disney had changed the name to improve the film&#x27;s appeal to the four quadrants: &quot;There was an audience perception that these movies were just for little girls but when boys, men, whatever actually see these movies they like them. So on &quot;Rapunzel&quot; … we changed the name and we called it &quot;Tangled&quot;. We did marketing that made the people who would not normally show up say, &#x27;Hey, this looks pretty good.&#x27;&quot;

==Music==

The musical score and soundtrack album were composed by Alan Menken with lyrics written by Glenn Slater. It marked Menken&#x27;s return to scoring for animated films, after recurringly doing so for several Disney Animation films till &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004). As several Pixar employees, being in charge for Disney, and the sensibilities being changed, Menken thought it as his biggest creative challenge and said that, he was &quot;finding a way that we could wed musical-theater storytelling with the Pixar style of storytelling was primary&quot;. Menken said he attempted to blend medieval music with 1960s folk rock to create the new songs and the score and soundtrack were recorded at a span of two-and-a-half years.

Several songs were written, but eventually cut from the final film; &quot;When Will My Life Begin?&quot; replaced an earlier version called &quot;What More Could I Ever Need?&quot;. Menken reported that that opening number went through five or six different versions. Elsewhere, Menken reported that there was originally a love song called &quot;You Are My Forever&quot; that Mother Gothel sang to Rapunzel in a motherly way, but was reprised later in the film by Flynn Rider in a romantic way. This idea was apparently replaced with the two songs &quot;Mother Knows Best&quot; and &quot;I See the Light&quot;. The song &quot;Something That I Want&quot; written and performed by Grace Potter from Grace Potter and the Nocturnals is featured in the closing credits. The Latin American Spanish version of the song, titled &quot;Algo quiero querer&quot;, was recorded by Colombian pop-singer, Fanny Lú.

The soundtrack, released on Walt Disney Records on November 10, 2010, and peaked at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 7 on the Soundtrack chart, and number 3 on the Kid Albums chart. Four years later, a double LP picture disc titled as Songs from Tangled was released on March 21, 2014.

The website&#x27;s critical consensus is: &quot;While far from Disney&#x27;s greatest film, &quot;Tangled&quot; is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio&#x27;s classic animated canon.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score based on reviews from mainstream film critics, calculated a score of 71/100 based on 34 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore during the opening weekend, gave the film an average grade &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; positively reviewed the film as &quot;the 50th animated feature from Disney, and its look and spirit convey a modified, updated but nonetheless sincere and unmistakable quality of old-fashioned Disneyness.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; film critic Richard Corliss wrote that &quot;Tangled&quot; &quot;wades into the DreamWorks style of sitcom gags and anachronistic sass,&quot; while praising the film for achieving &quot;the complex mix of romance, comedy, adventure and heart that defines the best Disney features.&quot; Corliss included &quot;Tangled&quot; at 19 in a list of top 25 All-time Best Animated films. Kenneth Turan from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; awarded the film four stars out of five; he described the film as a &quot;gorgeous computer-animated look that features rich landscapes and characters that look fuller and more lifelike than they have in the past.&quot; Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media gave the film five out of five stars, writing, &quot;Fantastic princess adventure is fun, with great messages.&quot; Gael Cooper of NBC News expressed that &quot;Tangled&quot; may be the best Disney film of all time.

James Berardinelli commented on his review website &quot;ReelViews&quot; that the film is &quot;entertaining and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking.&quot; He also stated Rapunzel is &quot;not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle&quot; as well as stating &quot;the songs are neither catchy nor memorable.&quot; Todd McCarthy, film reviewer for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; opened his review with, &quot;It would have been nice if Disney&#x27;s self-touted 50th animated feature were one of its best, a film that could stand with the studio&#x27;s classics, but the world will have to make do with &quot;Tangled&quot;, a passably entertaining hodgepodge of old and new animation techniques, mixed sensibilities and hedged commercial calculations.&quot;

==Future ==
=== Potential sequel ===
In December 2014, &quot;Tangled&quot;″s producer, Roy Conli, revealed that the production team had been &quot;heavily pushed&quot; for a feature-length sequel to the film, but when the writers and directors got together to develop one, they realized, &quot;she cut her hair. It&#x27;s over!&quot; Conli explained that at Disney Animation under Lasseter, it is always the filmmakers who decide whether they are ready to make a sequel (not marketing or merchandising). In January 2015, Conli again provided a similar explanation when pressed on this point, and also mentioned that directors Greno and Howard ultimately &quot;weren&#x27;t really interested&quot; in continuing the story.

=== Live-action adaptation ===
In May 2020, Hannah Shaw-Williams of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asked whether the success of the movie would lead to a sequel (apart from the short film &quot;Tangled Ever After&quot;), stating there is no word of it being in active development, while also stating that Disney is &quot;developing a live-action movie about Rapunzel,&quot; and stating that it would take several years for a possible movie to reach theaters. The latter film was confirmed to be in development in December 2024, with Michael Gracey attached to direct and Jennifer Kaytin Robinson writing the script.
