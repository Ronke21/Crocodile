<text>Connectix Corporation was a software and hardware company that released innovative products that were either made obsolete as Apple Computer incorporated the ideas into system software, or were sold to other companies once they became popular. It was formed in October 1988 by Jon Garber; the dominant board members and co-founders were Garber, Bonnie Fought (the two were later married), and close friend Roy McDonald. McDonald was still Chief Executive Officer and president when Connectix finally closed in August 2003.

== Products ==
Primary products included these:
* Virtual: Its original flagship product, which introduced virtual memory to the Macintosh operating system, Mac OS, years before Apple&#x27;s implementation in System 7. Virtual also runs on a motley assortment of accelerator cards for the original Mac, Mac Plus, and Mac SE, which were not supported by Apple.
* HandOff II: The file launcher developed by Fred Hollander of Utilitron, Inc. This INIT for Macintosh solved the &quot;Application Not Found&quot; problem by launching a substitute application for the one that created the file the user was trying to open. Apple would later build a similar functionality into System 7.
* SuperMenu: The first commercial hierarchical Apple menu, developed by Fred Hollander of Utilitron, Inc. Again, Apple would make a hierarchal Apple menu standard in System 7, by buying one of the many shareware versions of the same concept.
* MODE32: Software which allows 32-bit memory management on &quot;32-bit dirty&quot; Macintosh systems. Later bought by Apple and distributed for free, at least in part to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by customers who demanded to know why their 32-bit 68020 microprocessors could not access more than 8 megabytes of RAM.
* Optima: Makes System 6 32-bit clean and puts a Macintosh IIsi into 32-bit mode. This makes all of the physical RAM addressable by System 6. It can have one application open at a time.
* MAXIMA: A RAM disk utility, better than the one that later came with Mac OS as it saved its contents before and after reboots, while also allowing booting from the RAM disk.
* Connectix Desktop Utilities (CDU): A collection of utilities for desktop systems, including utilities for power management (screen dimming and automatic power down), synchronizing files when multiple disks are used, and custom desktop background images. A version of the CDU software received an Energy Star Compliant Controlling Device status from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the basis of the software&#x27;s power management functionality.
* Connectix Powerbook Utilities (CPU): A collection of utilities designed to simplify common tasks for laptop users.
* RAM Doubler: The first product to combine compression with virtual memory. A top selling Mac utility for many years which eventually was made obsolete as Apple improved their own virtual memory. There is also a RAM Doubler for Windows 3.1 which uses compression to increase system resources, allowing more applications to run. RAM Doubler was something of a case study for porting Macintosh products to the PowerPC processor, as CEO Roy McDonald presented a paper detailing the company&#x27;s porting efforts at the Sumeria Technology and Issues Conference on June 30, 1994.
* Agent95: The replacement for the Windows side of RAM Doubler. In addition to being updated with Windows 95 support, it also added resource monitoring capabilities.
* Speed Doubler: Software that combines an enhanced disk cache called Speed Access, better Finder copy utility called Speed Copy, and a dynamically recompiling 68K-to-PowerPC emulator called Speed Emulator, which is faster than both the interpretive emulator that shipped in the original PowerPCs and the dynamically recompiling emulator that Apple shipped in later machines. It was made obsolete as 68K applications became less common and OS code improved, though its better Finder copy utility would be spun off into its own OS 9 compatible product called CopyAgent.
* Surf Express: A local proxy server designed to accelerate the web browsing experience by caching and auto-refreshing frequently visited web sites. Offered for both Mac OS and Windows 95.
* QuickCam: The first webcam. Originally the sole design of Jon Garber, he wanted to call it the &quot;Mac-camera&quot;, but was vetoed by marketing, who saw the possibility of it one day becoming a cross-platform product. It became the first Connectix Windows product 14 months later, with RAM Doubler for Windows 3.1 being the next. The Mac QuickCam shipped in August 1994, RAM Doubler for Windows in April 1995, and QuickCam for Windows in October 1995. The line was sold to Logitech in August 1998 for $25 million. QuickCam is now considered one of the top gadgets of all time.
* DoubleTalk: Access Windows-Based Network Resources - Access Windows fileservers, transfer files to and from shared Windows workstations over the network and print to shared PC-based PostScript printers.
* Virtual Game Station: PlayStation emulation software. Sold to Sony, who bought it only after their lawsuit to stop it failed, and then dropped the product immediately.
* Virtual PC and Virtual server: Emulation software of x86-based personal computers for the Macintosh, Windows and OS/2. Sold to Microsoft, the transaction was completed on February 18, 2003.

With the sale of &quot;Virtual PC&quot; development and support, staff were transferred to Microsoft, including Connectix&#x27;s Chief Technical Officer Eric Traut, but not including any of the Connectix board members or Technical Support. Its Macintosh products, including &quot;DoubleTalk&quot;, &quot;CopyAgent&quot; and &quot;RAM Doubler&quot;, were discontinued.

Lugo is the only city in the world to be surrounded by completely intact Roman walls, which reach a height of along a circuit ringed with 71 towers. The walk along the top is continuous around the circuit and features ten gates. The 3rd century Roman walls, the only one of its kind in the world, are protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The city&#x27;s historic bridge over the Mi√±o is also essentially of Roman date. The city of Lugo is along the Camino Primitivo path of the Camino de Santiago.

==Population==
The population of the city in 2018 was 98,026 inhabitants, which has been growing constantly since the first census in 1842, despite the fact that the rest of the province is losing population dramatically. The population of the city in 2014 was 98,560 inhabitants (45,948 men and 52,612 women). From INE (Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica).

By April 2020, the population had grown to 99,638. Reaching 100,000 inhabitants is one of the goals of the city Mayor, Lara M√©ndez.

By language, according to 2008 data, 47.37% of the population speaks always or mainly in Galician, 52.63% speaks always or mainly in Spanish.

==Geography==

The town lies on a hill surrounded by the rivers Mi√±o, Rato and Chanca. The difference in altitude between the city centre and the river banks is considerable: the former being at an altitude of 465 meters above sea level, whilst the Mi√±o River Walk is at an altitude of only . The municipality of Lugo is the second largest in Galicia, with and 59 parishes. The outline of the city was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO on 7 November 2002, this being the most important recognition at international level regarding the conservation of landscapes and habitats of this Atlantic European region.

The area has been divided into more than 54 villages:
Adai, Bacur√≠n, Bascuas, Bazar, Benade, Bocamaos, B√≥veda, O Burgo, Calde, Camoira, Carballido, Coeo, Coeses, Cu√≠√±a, Esperante,

===Climate===
Lugo has a humid oceanic climate with drier summers, &quot;Cfb&quot; in the K√∂ppen climate classification although it could also be classified as a mild Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) depending on favoured summer precipitation threshold. Due to its remoteness from the Atlantic, its annual precipitation of can be considered low compared with areas of the Rias Baixas and Santiago de Compostela. The highest temperature recorded in history, , occurred in August 1961 and the lowest temperature was in February 1983. The city has an average of six days of snow per year, which is a contrast to coastal cities of Galicia which have not received snow in modern times.

==History==
Later conquered by Paullus Fabius Maximus and called Lucus Augusti in 13 BC on the positioning of a Roman military camp, while the Roman Empire completed the conquest, in the North, of the Iberian Peninsula. Situated in what was the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, it was the chief town of the tribe of the Capori. Though small it was the most important Roman town in what became Gallaecia during the Roman period, the seat of a &quot;conventus&quot;, one of three in Gallaecia, and later became one of the two capitals of Gallaecia, and gave its name to the &quot;Calla√Øci Lucenses&quot;. It was centrally situated in a large gold mining region, which during the Roman period was very active. The Conventus Lucensis, according to Pliny, began at the river Navilubio, and contained 16 peoples; besides the Celtici and Lebuni. Though these tribes were not powerful, and their names &quot;barbarous&quot; to Roman ears, there were among them 166,000 freemen. The city stood on one of the upper branches of the Minius (modern Mi√±o), on the road from Bracara to Asturica, and had some famous baths, near the bridge across the Mi√±o.

Lucus was the seat of a bishopric by the later 5th century at the latest and remained an administrative center under the Suebi and Visigoths, before going into such a decline that the site was found to be deserted in the middle of the 8th century by Bishop Odoario, who set about reviving it. 10th-century attempts at rebuilding its &quot;casas destructas&quot; (abandoned tenements) suggest that it remained a town only on paper: the seat of a bishopric, administered by a count, from which royal charters were issued. &quot;Its commercial and industrial role was insignificant&quot;, Richard Fletcher wrote of 11th century Lugo.

During the Middle Ages Lugo, like Santiago de Compostela, was a center of pilgrimage, because the cathedral had the special privilege, which it still retains today, of exposing to the public the consecrated host twenty-four hours a day. In the 18th century Lugo was granted the privilege of organizing the fairs of St. Froil√°n. During the Modern Age, Lugo had a certain supremacy, although other nearby towns such as Mondo√±edo or Ribadeo disputed it. It was not until the division of the state into provinces in 1833 and the creation of provincial governments that Lugo has become the most important town in the province of Lugo, because of its capital status. This rise has been bolstered by the arrival of the first railroad to the city in 1875.

During the 20th century the city continued to grow as the administration and services center of the province. In 1936, when the Civil War broke out, the city came quickly under the Nationalists&#x27; control. In the 1970s the city undertook important reforms, like the development of the Ceao Industrial Area (1979) and the complete restoration of the Roman walls.

Infanta Elena, the elder daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof√≠a of Spain and fourth in the line of succession to the Spanish throne, has been duchess of Lugo since 1995.

In 2000, the recognition of the Roman walls on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site was an important event in the city.

==Economy==
Lugo is a city of services. The main activities are commercial, the administration (offices of the autonomous and central Governments) and educational and health services (the recently opened &quot;Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti&quot; is the largest in Galicia). The steady increase of population of the city has coincided with the development of the major economic sectors of the municipality. Industry is scarce and almost exclusively dedicated to the processing of agricultural products (dairy, meat, timber ...).

There is a shopping center on the outskirts of the city (As Termas), with an Eroski hypermarket, cinemas, clothing stores like H&amp;M, NewYorker or Cortefiel and many restaurants and fast food chains like McDonald&#x27;s. A new shopping center (Abella) has opened in late 2015 and hosts an E.Leclerc hypermarket, a bowling court, cinemas and a McFit fitness center.

The University of Santiago de Compostela has several faculties at its Lugo Campus, one of the most important being the Faculty of Veterinary sciences, one of the leading in its field in Spain.

The daily newspaper , is published in the city. It&#x27;s the most read newspaper in the province of Lugo.

There is a private aerodrome in the nearby town of Rozas, owned by the Spanish Ministry of Defence and administered by Real Aero Club de Lugo. In 2011, the Ministry of Defence transferred the installations to INTA, Spain&#x27;s space agency, in order to convert it into a center of aeronautical research,

==Main sights==
Lugo is the only city in the world to be surrounded by completely intact Roman walls, which reach a height of 10 to 15 metres along a 2117¬†m circuit ringed with 71 towers. The walk along the top is continuous round the circuit, and features ten gates. These 3rd century walls are protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The bridge over the Mi√±o is essentially of Roman date, though many repairs over the centuries have effaced its Roman character.

Other sources suggest that the name &quot;Lucus Augusti&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;Lucus&quot;, which means &quot;sacred grove&quot;, or &quot;sacred forest&quot;, as the city was founded on the place of a small grove.

Besides the walls, sights include:
* the Cathedral, dedicated to St. Mary, built about 1129, though the actual main fa√ßade and towers date only from 1769. Its elegant stalls were carved by Francisco Mouro in 1624. This cathedral enjoys the privilege of having the Blessed Sacrament perpetually exposed, a fact commemorated in the armorial bearings of the town.
* Convent and church of St. Francis, in Gothic style, with remains of the sober cloister. It currently houses the Museo Provincial, which shows a display of Galician art and other building of the 18th century
* Church of St. Dominic
* City Hall (&quot;Casa do Concello&quot; in Galician), a large Baroque structure with a mid-18th century fa√ßade. Annexed is a clock tower, originally from the 16th century, but rebuilt later.
* Palace of the arts (C√≠rculo das Artes)
* The Roman Bridge over river Mi√±o.
* Rosal√≠a de Castro Park, a 23 ha park in the city center. It has a small pond in the middle and contains many species of trees, like three sequoias.
* Museo Interactivo de Historia de Lugo (MIHL), an interactive museum about the history of the city, made by Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos.

Two important festivals take place in Lugo:
* Saint Froilan festivity, which lasts from 4‚Äì12 October, dedicated to the city&#x27;s patron saint. It&#x27;s a Fiesta of National Tourist Interest and it&#x27;s very popular to eat polbo √° feira in one of the many stands near Rosal√≠a de Castro park.
* Arde Lucus, festival celebrated in the last weeks of June which revives the Roman and castro past of the city, and which emerged to commemorate the declaration of the city&#x27;s Roman wall as a World Heritage Site in 2000. In its latest editions it has reached nearly half a million visitors.

==Sports==
The most popular and known professional team of the city is the basketball team CB Breog√°n, currently playing in Liga ACB, the first division in Spain, the team has played many seasons in Liga ACB the top Spanish basketball league. The team occupies the 9th position in the historical ranking of that league.

Futsal is also popular in Lugo, represented by Azkar Lugo, which plays in Second Divisi√≥n de Futsal, the Spanish second division.

<text>Action Replay is the brand name of a cheating device (such as cheat cartridges) created by Datel. The Action Replay is available for many computer and gaming systems including Commodore 64, Amiga, IBM PC, Nintendo DS, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and the Xbox. The name is derived from the first devices‚Äô signature ability to pause the execution of the software and save the computer&#x27;s state (the complete contents of the memory) to disk or tape for future ‚Äúreplay‚Äù. The ability to manipulate the contents of memory in this paused state permitted the cheat functions for which the brand is now better known.

==Typical features==
Typical cheating options include:
*Making the player character stronger, such as with infinite lives, invulnerability, permanent power-ups, no collision detection, walk through walls, one-hit kills, super-high jumps, infinite money, etc.
*Warping directly to specific levels.
*The ability to download, upload, import and export saved games from and to the Internet or a storage device.
*Allowing the player to save the game state to disk, so that the game can be restarted from that point even if it does not support saving.
*Region-free operation.
*Loading of third-party or homebrew applications/games.
*Display of internal game data which are not normally seen by the player.

==Action Replay DS and DSi ==
Also known as Action Replay for the Nintendo DS system, this device is a part of the main series created by Datel. The device usually comes with a cartridge, a software disc, and a cable to connect the device to a computer. Unlike future iterations, these versions communicate directly with the game&#x27;s memory in real time. Because of this, the desired game needs to be inserted within the cartridge and then inserted into the system. Codes are created using the hexadecimal numbering system, and while Datel supplies a rich base of codes, users are given the ability to create their own codes.

==Power-Saves ==
Power-Saves by Action Replay are a related series of video-game cheat devices. Unlike the main Action Replay series, which cheats by modifying the game code itself, Power-Saves store the game saves created by Datel, allowing users to cheat without modifying the game code being executed. 
Power-Saves are available for game systems such as the Wii on an SD card and the Nintendo 3DS.

<doc id="616274" wikidata="Q575043" url="?curid=616274" title="Alfred Austin">
<text>Alfred Austin (30 May 1835 ‚Äì 2 June 1913) was an English poet who was appointed Poet Laureate in 1896, after an interval following the death of Tennyson, when the other candidates had either caused controversy or refused the honour. It was claimed that he was being rewarded for his support for the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury in the General Election of 1895. Austin&#x27;s poems are little remembered today, his most popular work being prose idylls celebrating nature. Wilfred Scawen Blunt wrote of him, &quot;He is an acute and ready reasoner, and is well read in theology and science. It is strange his poetry should be such poor stuff, and stranger still that he should imagine it immortal.&quot;

==Life==
Alfred Austin was born in Headingley, near Leeds, on 30 May 1835, to a Roman Catholic family. His father, Joseph Austin, was a merchant in Leeds; his mother was a sister of Joseph Locke, the civil engineer and M.P. for Honiton. Austin was educated at Stonyhurst College (Clitheroe, Lancashire), St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, and University of London, from which he graduated in 1853. He became a barrister in 1857 but after inheriting a fortune from his uncle gave up his legal career for literature.

He unsuccessfully stood as a Conservative Party candidate for Taunton in 1865, finishing in fourth place, and at Dewsbury in 1880.

Politically conservative, between 1866 and 1896 Austin edited &quot;National Review&quot; and wrote leading articles for &quot;The Standard&quot;. He was Foreign Affairs Correspondent with the &quot;Standard&quot; and served as a special correspondent to the Ecumenical Council of the Vatican in 1870; at the Headquarters of the King of Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War, 1870; at the Congress of Berlin, 1878 where he was granted an audience by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. An ardent imperialist and follower of Disraeli he became, in 1883, joint editor of the National Review with W. J. Courthope and was sole editor from 1887 until 1896.

On Tennyson&#x27;s death in 1892 it was felt that none of the then living poets, except Algernon Charles Swinburne or William Morris, who were outside consideration on other grounds, was of sufficient distinction to succeed to the laurel crown, and for several years no new poet-laureate was nominated. In the interval the claims of one writer and another were assessed, but eventually, in 1896, Austin was appointed to the post after Morris had declined it. As a poet Austin never ranked highly in the opinions of his peers and was often derided as being a &quot;Banjo Byron&quot;.

The critic Edmund Broadus wrote that the choice of Austin for poet-laureate had much to do with Austin&#x27;s friendship with Lord Salisbury, his position as an editor and leader writer, and his willingness to use his poetry to support the government. For example, shortly before his appointment was announced, Austin published a sonnet entitled &quot;A Vindication of England&quot;, written in response to a series of sonnets by William Watson, published in the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;, that had accused Salisbury&#x27;s government of betraying Armenia and abandoning its people to Turkish massacres.

Sir Owen Seaman (1861‚Äì1936) gave added currency to the supposed connection with Lord Salisbury in his poem, &quot;To Mr Alfred Austin&quot;, &quot;In Cap and Bells&quot;, London &amp; New York, 1900, 9:

At length a callous Tory chief arose,Master of caustic jest and cynic gibe,Looked round the Carlton Club and lightly choseIts leading scribe.

Austin served as Deputy-Lieutenant for Herefordshire. Austin died of unknown causes at Swinford Old Manor, Hothfield, near Ashford, Kent, England, where he had been ill for some time.

==Family==

On 14 November 1865 Austin married Hester Jane Homan-Mulock, tenth child of Thomas Homan-Mulock and Frances Sophia Berry at St Marylebone Parish Church, London. In his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Austin gives a curious account of how they met. Seeing the photograph of a young lady in an album belonging to his friend Isa Blagden in Florence, he had asked: &quot;Who is that?&quot; and received the reply, &quot;The girl you ought to marry, if you can.&quot; Austin brought home a letter of introduction, the presentation of which led to his receiving at his cottage in Hertfordshire Hester (the young lady in the photograph), her sister and their chaperon, together with their friend Thomas Adolphus Trollope, brother of Anthony Trollope. At a second visit Hester became engaged to Alfred. Throughout his career as journalist and writer Austin derived constant help and support from his wife. She died suddenly on 23 September 1929 at her residence in Kensington. His nephews included the Polar Explorer Captain George Mulock and British diplomat Sir Howard William Kennard (1878‚Äì1955), British Ambassador to Poland at the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Poetry==
In 1861, after two false starts in poetry and fiction, he made his first noteworthy appearance as a writer with &quot;The Season: a Satire&quot;, which contained incisive lines, and was marked by some promise both in wit and observation. In 1870 he published a volume of criticism, &quot;The Poetry of the Period&quot;, which was conceived in the spirit of satire, and attacked Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold and Swinburne in an unrestrained fashion. The book aroused some discussion at the time, but its lack of balance meant that its judgments were extremely uncritical. Austin wrote of the &quot;detestable gibberish&quot; of Robert Browning, of Swinburne&#x27;s &quot;emasculated poetic voice,&quot; and of William Morris as &quot;the idle singer of an empty day,&quot; and he prophesied that Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam&quot; &quot;will assuredly be handed over to the dust when a generation arises that has come to its senses.&quot; Austin himself, while he continued to &quot;think that there was a strong element of truth in &quot;The Poetry of the Period&quot;,&quot; soon came to deem &quot;the tone in which it was written unfortunate,&quot; and in 1873, three years after its publication, he withdrew it from circulation.

A contemporary critic, Walter Whyte, praised the &quot;purity&quot; of Austin&#x27;s style: &quot;He writes sound unaffected English; his meaning is always transparent. He has not sought to emulate Tennyson&#x27;s exquisite elaboration of diction; his lines are seldom jewelled by &#x27;curious felicities.&#x27; But they are always graceful, and sometimes admirably vigorous and hearty.[...] One of the charms of his poetry lies in the freshness and vividness of his descriptions of Nature. He has dealt powerfully with the grandeurs of Alpine scenery, but his happiest pictures are of English fields and woods.&quot; 

The critic George Saintsbury, while endorsing the general view that &quot;Alfred Austin hardly deserved to be made poet laureate,&quot; found him &quot;a really vigorous and accomplished writer of prose, and a tolerable master of unambitious form in verse.&quot; Austin, he wrote, &quot;could keep up poems of some length like &quot;Prince Lucifer&quot; and &quot;The Human Tragedy&quot;,&quot; and approach a modicum of &quot;vigour and passion in lyric.&quot;

As poet-laureate, his topical verses did not escape negative criticism; a hasty poem written in praise of the Jameson Raid in 1896 being a notable instance. A drama by him, &quot;Flodden Field&quot;, was performed at His Majesty&#x27;s theatre in 1903, with incidental music by Percy Pitt. A number of his poems were set to music by Frances Allitsen, and Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Choral Songs in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria&quot; (1899) was a setting of Austin&#x27;s occasional poem &quot;With wisdom, goodness, grace&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Austin was the subject of a Vanity Fair cartoon by Spy published on 20 February 1896.

He was caricatured as &quot;Sir Austed Alfrin&quot; by L. Frank Baum in his 1906 novel &quot;John Dough and the Cherub&quot;.

Van Morrison&#x27;s song &quot;Haunts of Ancient Peace&quot;, the first track on his 1980 album &quot;Common One&quot;, took its title from Austin&#x27;s 1902 book of the same name.

<text>The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom that sets out how political parties, elections and referendums are to be regulated in the United Kingdom. It formed an important part of the constitutional reform programme implemented by the 1997 Labour Government, building on the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 (c. 48) which was passed two years earlier.

==Background==

The Act was introduced after consultation with major political parties, and largely followed the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (known at the time as the &quot;Neill Committee&quot; after its chairman), an independent body set-up by former Prime Minister John Major to consider ways of making politics more transparent. The committee set out its proposals in its report, &quot;The Funding of Political Parties in the United Kingdom&quot;.

The Act created an independent Electoral Commission to regulate political parties and their funding arrangements. It also required parties to submit statements of their accounts on a regular basis, and prohibited the receipt of funds from foreign or anonymous donors. Restrictions on campaign expenditure were also put in place, dictating the maximum amount that parties were able to spend.

==Details==

===Registration of parties===

The law gave the newly formed Electoral Commission a role in controlling the registration of political parties.

The requirement for parties to register with an official body, if they wished to be named on ballot papers, was the result of a fairly wide acceptance that the finances of political groups should be regulated to reduce the perception of underhand dealings.

In addition, political groups or individuals failing to register with the Commission would only be able to describe themselves as &quot;Independent&quot; on ballot papers, or else have a blank space instead of a description after their names‚Äîwith the single exception of the Speaker of the House of Commons who is entitled to be described as: &quot;The Speaker seeking re-election&quot;.

This built on the provisions of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, passed amid concern about voters being fooled by misleading ballot descriptions.

There is an annual fee for the registration of a political party.

===Donations===

Under the terms of the law, registered political parties are only allowed to accept donations in excess of ¬£500 from &quot;permissible donors&quot;, defined as either individuals on an electoral register in the United Kingdom, or political parties, companies, trade unions, or similar organisations that are registered in the country.

The provision of non-financial support to a registered party ‚Äì such as subsidies or free materials ‚Äì is counted as a donation. Each party is required to submit details of all donations received, whether by party headquarters or their subsidiary parts. Each report must provide sufficient information to show that a donor counts as a &quot;permissible source&quot;.

Political parties on the separate register for Northern Ireland are exempt from the controls on accepting and reporting donations.

===Expenditure===
The Act places strict limits on the amount each party may spend in the run-up to the election (how that time period is defined depends on the type of election). As of 2024, the limit for elections to the UK Parliament in Westminster stands at ¬£54,010 per constituency contested; this would reach a maximum of ¬£34.13 million for parties contesting all 632 seats in Great Britain. This spending limit applies within 365 days of a General Election. These spending limits were last increased in November 2023.

The amount permitted to be spent by third-parties during Parliamentary elections to support or oppose candidates was increased from the previous limit of ¬£5 (which had been held to be an impermissible restriction on freedom of expression by the European Convention on Human Rights in the case of &quot;Bowman v United Kingdom&quot;) to ¬£500.

===Referendums===
The Act provides a basic framework to the running of all future referendums that are to be held under the jurisdiction of the Electoral Commission in pursuance of any provision made by a subsequent Act of Parliament in the following areas:

*United Kingdom 
**England
**Northern Ireland
**Scotland
**Wales

The Act also makes the provision that in any future UK-wide referendum the chairperson of the Electoral Commission is appointed &quot;Chief Counting Officer&quot; for the United Kingdom or gives the power for the chairperson to appoint a Chief Counting Officer.

==Controversy==

In December 2006 Prime Minister Tony Blair and politicians of other parties were questioned by police as part of their investigation into the Cash for Honours affair. Part of their time was said to be spent looking at whether the Act had been breached by parties taking loans from supporters in return for nominations to the House of Lords. Unlike donations, loans did not have to be made public as long as they were made on &quot;commercial terms&quot;.

The Government later changed the law to require the declaration of all forms of loan, and asked a former Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, Sir Hayden Phillips, to undertake a fundamental review of party funding arrangements. He reported in 2008.

In November 2007 the provisions of the Act were again the subject of scrutiny in the cases of Labour party donor David Abrahams and Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander.

In 2016, several UK police forces started investigations into allegations of election fraud during the 2015 general election, specifically on allegations that the Conservatives breached the spending limits. The majority of allegations focus on the misrepresentation of the &quot;battle-bus&quot; finances.

<text>Marmaduke Tunstall (1743 ‚Äì 11 October 1790) was an English ornithologist and collector. He was the author of &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot; (1771), probably the first British work to use binomial nomenclature.

Tunstall was born at Burton Constable in Yorkshire. In 1760, he succeeded to the family estates of Scargill, Hutton, Long Villers and Wycliffe. Being a Catholic, he was educated at Douai in France. On completing his studies, he took up residence in Welbeck Street, London, where he formed an extensive museum, as well as a large collection of living birds and animals. He is known for formally describing the Peregrine falcon. After his marriage in 1776, the museum was moved to Wycliffe, and at the time, was one of the finest in England.

Tunstall became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London at the age of twenty-one, and in 1771, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

Tunstall died at Wycliffe, and his estates passed to his half-brother, William Constable. Constable invited Thomas Bewick, whom Marmaduke had commissioned to engrave &#x27;The Wild Bull of the Ancient Caledonian Breed, now in the park at Chilingham-Castle, Northumberland&#x27;, to Wycliffe where he spent two months making drawings from the bird specimens. The museum, known as the Wycliffe Museum, was sold to George Allan of Blackwell Grange, Darlington who set up the contents in his home. The museum remained even after his death in 1800 at the Grange until 1822 when it was purchased by the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, and becoming the &quot;Newcastle Museum.&quot;

<text>Nunatsiavut (; ) is an autonomous area claimed by the Inuit in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The settlement area includes territory in Labrador extending to the Quebec border. In 2002, the Labrador Inuit Association submitted a proposal for limited autonomy to the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. The constitution was ratified on December 1, 2005, at which time the Labrador Inuit Association ceased to exist, and the new Government of Nunatsiavut was established, initially being responsible for health, education and cultural affairs. It is also responsible for setting and conducting elections, the first of which was executed in October 2006. An election for the ordinary members of the Nunatsiavut Assembly was held on May 4, 2010. Its incumbent president is Johannes Lampe who assumed office in 2016.

In Inuttitut/Inuktitut, Nunatsiavut means &quot;Our Beautiful Land&quot;. This name was ratified by the Labrador Inuit Constitution and passed by the Labrador Inuit Association in 2002. A primary objective of autonomy is for the preservation of the Inuit culture and language, as well as the environment through environmental stewardship.

Nunatsiavut is counted in the census as Division 11.

==Self-governance==
The Labrador Inuit Association had filed a land claim for portions of Labradorian land in 1977. In 1988, the Labrador Inuit Association, the government of the province of Newfoundland, and the government of Canada began negotiations based on the land claim. An agreement-in-principle was achieved in 2001, and on May 26, 2004, the agreement was ratified by over 75% of eligible voters subject to the land claim.

On January 22, 2005, the Inuit of Nunatsiavut signed the Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement with the federal and provincial governments covering of land, including the entire northern salient of Labrador north of Nain as well as a portion of the Atlantic coast south of there. The agreement also includes of sea rights. Although the Inuit will not own the whole area, they were granted special rights related to traditional land use, and they will own designated Labrador Inuit Lands. The agreement also establishes the Torngat Mountains National Park in the northern area of the land claim.

The Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement is a treaty between the Inuit of Labrador, the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the federal government of Canada, that is constitutionally protected under the aboriginal and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada granted by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

The self-governance agreement included a transfer of $130 million from the federal government in compensation for the forced relocation of the Inuit in the 1950s; $120 million to establish self-government; royalty payments from the provincial government for resource extraction; and land, mineral, and marine rights. Unspecified benefits for Inuit in Labrador not within the settlement area were also part of the agreement.

The agreement was ratified by the Labrador Inuit, the General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Parliament of Canada, where it received Royal Assent on June 23, 2005.

On December 1, 2005, the constitution was formally adopted, and a swearing-in ceremony was held for the first cabinet, an interim government which consisted of members of the Labrador Inuit Association board of directors. This day marked the official transfer of power from the provincial government to the newly formed Government of Nunatsiavut &quot;to make their own laws relating to cultural affairs, education and health&quot;.

In October 2006, Nunatsiavut held its first election to form a nine-member government, which was sworn in on October 16 in Hopedale.

In 2019, there were 150 Inuit children in the care of the Department of Children, Seniors, and Social Development. An independent review, &quot;A Long Wait for Change&quot;, was completed by the province&#x27;s Child and Youth Advocate at the request of the Nunatsiavut government and released in 2019. It contained 33 recommendations, including providing the support needed to transition to an Inuit-led child welfare system in Nunatsiavut.

On June 18, 2021, Nunatsiavut stated that it had begun the process of seeking devolution of child protection services from the Department of Children, Seniors, and Social Development with the goal for negotiations to conclude within three years.

===Nunatsiavut Assembly and Executive Council===
The land claim agreement provided for the establishment of the Government of Nunatsiavut to represent the residents of the land claim area and any Labrador Inuit living elsewhere in Canada. Nunatsiavut remained a part of Newfoundland and Labrador, but the Government of Nunatsiavut acquired the jurisdictional authority over health, education, and justice in the land claim area. Nunatsiavut operates under a consensus government within the parliamentary system of Canada.

The legislature of the government is based in Hopedale, and its administrative centre is in Nain. It is subject to the &quot;Nunatsiavut Elections Act&quot;. The Nunatsiavut Assembly consists of a minimum of 16 members, including:

* a president, who chairs the Nunatsiavut Executive Council,
* ten ordinary members (one each from Hopedale, Makkovik, Postville and Rigolet; two each from Nain, the Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Northwest River and Mud Lake area, and all Inuit elsewhere in Canada)
* the &quot;Angajukƒ∏√¢k&quot; (mayor) of each of the five Inuit Community Governments (one each in Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik and Rigolet)
* the Chairs of the Inuit Community Corporations.

There are currently two Inuit Community Corporations, &quot;NunaKatiget Inuit Community Corporation&quot; and &quot;Sivunivut Inuit Community Corporation&quot;, and 18 members in the Assembly.

From the Assembly, a member will be elected to act as First Minister. The Assembly would act as a forum for discussion of laws, and it will oversee the Executive Council.

The Nunatsiavut Executive Council will be appointed by the First Minister. It will implement laws, develop and implement policy, initiate and prepare legislation, oversee the administration of the government, and be accountable to the Assembly.

Inuit Community Governments were established in Nain, Hopedale, Makkovik, Postville and Rigolet. Each consists of a municipal council, elected from and by both Inuit and non-Inuit residents, and is led by an &quot;Angajukƒ∏√¢k&quot;, a chief executive officer and mayor, who must be Inuk.

Large settlements of Labrador Inuit outside the settlement area will be represented by Inuit Community Corporations.

The Angajukƒ∏√¢k of each Inuit Community Government and the chairperson of each Inuit Community Corporation will represent his or her community in the Nunatsiavut Assembly.

==Departments==
There are seven departments headed by six ministers with Nunatsiavut Secretariat headed by the President of the Executive Council.

* Department of Finance, Human Resources and Information Technology
* Department of Education and Economic Development
* Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism
* Department of Health &amp; Social Development
* Department of Lands and Natural Resources
* Department of Nunatsiavut Affairs
* Nunatsiavut Secretariat

==Wildlife, Plants, and Commercial Fisheries Co-management==
Chapters 12 and 13 of the Labrador Inuit Land Claim Agreement created the Torngat Wildlife and Plants Co-management Board, and the Torngat Joint Fisheries Board.

==Government buildings==
While each community has government facilities, there are two key sites:

Nunatsiavut Government Head Office is located at 25 Ikajuktauvik Road in Nain and houses the administrative functions of the Government of Nunatsiavut.

The Nunatsiavut Assembly sits at Nunatsiavut Assembly Building in Hopedale. The building opened in 2012, faces Hopedale Harbour and is the first permanent home since 2008 (previous assemblies met at various locations in Hopedale).

==Geography==

Nunatsiavut&#x27;s land claim includes the area surrounding Hamilton Inlet and the coastline north to a point south of Davis Inlet; the Mulligan River also forms part of the boundary. It also claims the land north of the Notakwanon River and as far north as Cape Chidley. Nunatsiavut is the southernmost recognized Inuit territory in Canada.

Nunatsiavut&#x27;s territory consists of two geographic regions. The southern portion contains Rigolet, Makkovik, Postville and Hopedale and has a population of 1,433 (as of 2016). The northern portion contains Nain as well as the Torngat Mountains National Park. Nunatsiavut is located near the Innu communities of Natuashish and Sheshatshiu as well as North West River, Happy Valley-Goose Bay and Cartwright. It is also near the Quebec settlements of Kuujjuaq and Kangiqsualujjuaq.

===Towns===

* Hopedale
* Makkovik
* Nain
* Postville
* Rigolet

===Land disputes===
The Labrador M√©tis Nation (LMN), unsuccessfully filed a challenge to Nunatsiavut&#x27;s claim in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. The LMN&#x27;s original land claim included all of Labrador south of Nain.

The Makivik Corporation had their claim to the coast between Killiniq Island and Voisey&#x27;s Bay accepted in 1993; it later asked the federal government not to ratify Nunatsiavut&#x27;s claims since it overlapped with their claim.

==Census Division No. 11==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Division No. 11 had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

===Unorganized subdivisions===
* Subdivision C
* Subdivision E

==Demographics==
===Languages===
====Knowledge of official languages====
===Religion===
According to the 2011 census, 98.73% of Nunatsiavut&#x27;s residents identify as Christian. 11.25% identified as Anglican while 79.62% identified as &quot;Other Christian&quot; (most likely Moravian). 1.49% of Nunatsiavut&#x27;s residents identified as having no religion.

===Ethnic origin===
According to the 2016 census, 91.8% of Nunatsiavut&#x27;s residents are of Indigenous ancestry. Of the 2,350 Indigenous Canadians, a total of 2,290 were Inuit, 35 were M√©tis and 25 were First Nations.

Nunatsiavut grants enrollment to what it defines as two different ethnicities, Inuit and the Kablun√¢ngajuit (mixed Inuit-European).
====Kablun√¢ngajuit====
According to the Nunatsiavut government, somebody who is a Kablun√¢ngajuk (plural: Kablun√¢ngajuit) is &quot;an individual who is given that designation according to
Inuit customs and traditions&quot;. The Nunatsiavut government applies this designation to somebody who is either of mixed Inuit and non-Inuit descent or is not of Inuit descent but settled in what is now Nunatsiavut before 1940. Their ancestors were mainly fur traders from places such as Quebec, Scotland, Norway and elsewhere who often married Inuit.

The term Kablun√¢ngajuk means &quot;person who resembles a white person&quot;. They were historically called terms such as &quot;settlers&quot; or &quot;half-breeds&quot;.

The Kablun√¢ngajuit are usually counted as Inuit by Statistics Canada so their exact population is unknown. As Nunatsiavut beneficiaries, they have all the same privileges as Inuit beneficiaries in the region.

===Employment===
In the 2016 census, 29.9% of Nunatsiavut&#x27;s population was unemployed. The Voisey&#x27;s Bay nickel mine is located about southwest of Nain.

==Transportation==
The MV &quot;Northern Ranger&quot; provided ferry service between Nunatsiavut&#x27;s five communities as well as Natuashish, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Cartwright and Black Tickle. In 2019 the ferry was replaced by . All five settlements also have airports with flights formerly provided by Air Labrador and now served by Air Borealis. No community in Nunatsiavut is road accessible; however, there have been some proposals to connect Nunatsiavut to the Trans-Labrador Highway.

<doc id="616292" wikidata="Q163493" url="?curid=616292" title="Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 21, was dedicated to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, an early patron of the composer. The piece was published in 1801 by Hoffmeister &amp; K√ºhnel of Leipzig. It is not known exactly when Beethoven finished writing this work, but sketches of the finale were found to be from 1795.

==Historical background==
The symphony is clearly indebted to Beethoven&#x27;s predecessors, particularly his teacher Joseph Haydn as well as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but nonetheless has characteristics that mark it uniquely as Beethoven&#x27;s work, notably the frequent use of &quot;sforzandi&quot;, as well as sudden shifts in tonal centers that were uncommon for traditional symphonic form (particularly in the third movement), and the prominent, more independent use of wind instruments. Sketches for the finale are found among the exercises Beethoven wrote while studying counterpoint under Johann Georg Albrechtsberger in the spring of 1797.

Beethoven originally intended to dedicate the symphony to Elector Maximilian Franz, who had been forced from Bonn by the armies of revolutionary France and was staying in Hetzendorf, just outside Vienna at the time. Beethoven had left the Elector&#x27;s employ in somewhat acrimonious circumstances in March 1794 and the dedication may have been intended as a peace offering. However, Maximilian Franz died 26 July 1801 and the dedication subsequently went to Baron van Swieten. 

The premiere took place on 2 April 1800 at the K.K. Hoftheater n√§chst der Burg in Vienna. Most sources agree that the concert program also included Beethoven&#x27;s Septet as well as a symphony by Mozart, but there is some disagreement as to whether the remainder of the program included excerpts from Haydn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Creation&quot; or from &quot;The Seasons&quot; and whether Beethoven&#x27;s own Piano Concerto No. 1 or No. 2 was performed. This concert effectively served to announce Beethoven&#x27;s talents to Vienna. Holy Roman Emperor Francis II is reported to have attended the premiere and reacted by saying, ‚ÄùThere is something revolutionary in that music!‚Äù

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following instrumentation:
The clarinet parts are commonly played on B clarinet, as C and D clarinets are no longer widely used. However, there is some controversy over whether they should be played on E instruments instead. The E clarinet&#x27;s timbre is much closer to that of the C and D clarinets than that of the warmer-sounding B clarinet. The second flute is not used in the second movement.

==Form==
There are four movements:
A typical performance lasts between 22 and 29 minutes.

==Description and analysis==

The beginning of the twelve-bar &quot;introduction&quot; of the first movement is sometimes considered a &quot;musical joke&quot;. For example, the English musicologist Donald Tovey has called this work &quot;a comedy of manners&quot;. In fact, Symphony No. 1 can be regarded as a result of Beethoven&#x27;s bold musical experimentation and advancement which he presents five years after Haydn&#x27;s last symphony and twelve years after Mozart&#x27;s final &quot;Jupiter Symphony&quot;: Unusually, Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 starts with a sequence of repeatedly accentuated dominant‚Äìtonic chord sequences, however, in the &quot;wrong&quot; key and untouching and leading away from the tonic, so that the listener only gradually realizes the real key (or home key) of the symphony.

&lt;/score&gt;In correlation to the tradition, however, the first movement is composed exemplarily in sonata form. Here, as a new element, Beethoven uses the more lyrical second subject to display and intertwine the woodwind with the string instruments. The development is elaborate and mainly based on the first subject of the movement and explores a long harmonic progression (starting from A major, reaching B major, passing F major at the end); it also refines the juxtaposition and combination of the orchestral instruments (woodwinds and strings); the recapitulation is almost coherent with the exposition; the coda reminisces the motivic work of the development before it closes the movement with strongly repeated chords played by the whole orchestra.

Due to Beethoven&#x27;s metronome markings and the addition of the indication of &quot;con moto&quot; (&quot;with motion&quot;), the &quot;Andante&quot; (in F major, the subdominant of the symphony&#x27;s home key) of the second movement is played considerably faster than the general concept of that tempo. In contrast to the tradition, Beethoven uses the entire instrumentation of the orchestra (2nd flute tacet) and, consequently, displays a vast spectrum of sound in this movement which, as well, is composed in sonata form.

The third movement is on the one hand remarkable because, although it is indicated as &quot;Menuetto&quot;, it is marked &quot;Allegro molto e vivace&quot; and, consequently, to be played so fast that it is essentially a &quot;Scherzo&quot; ‚Äì a description mostly used after Beethoven&#x27;s first symphony. Secondly, as an inherent element of the &quot;scherzo&quot;, it does not customarily display new melodies or motives, but instead uses the musical scales and triads from the first movement as motivic material which render this movement&#x27;s momentum and wit. One notable element of this movement is the sudden change of tonal center very early in the movement. While many opening themes of symphonic writing of the Classical period typically stayed within diatonic harmony, Beethoven shifts chromatically from C major up to D flat major only about 36 bars into the movement. Given the tempo, a listener would hear that dramatic shift only about 15 seconds into the movement.

The finale opens with another introduction consisting only of scale fragments played slowly by the first violins alone (an unusual effect) beginning on G and gradually adding more notes. After finally reaching an F, outlining a dominant seventh chord in C major, the real start of the finale &quot;Allegro molto e vivace&quot; begins in C major with a theme similar (both in rhythm and character) to the 4th movement of Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 88 in G major. Composed again in a solid sonata form, Beethoven uses the scale as the prevailing motivic element in this movement which, by character, pays most of all tribute to the customary finale established by Haydn in the preceding decades.

The musical form is in accordance with the established composing tradition. Musical content, instrumentation as well as tempi, is unusual, if not revolutionary, in its use for a symphonic work of Beethoven&#x27;s time. Therefore, Beethoven introduced himself with this work uniquely and boldly as an advancing symphonic composer and stood true to this statement throughout his compositional life.

<text>Soft matter or soft condensed matter is a type of matter that can be deformed or structurally altered by thermal or mechanical stress which is of similar magnitude to thermal fluctuations.

The science of soft matter is a subfield of condensed matter physics. Soft materials include liquids, colloids, polymers, foams, gels, granular materials, liquid crystals, flesh, and a number of biomaterials. These materials share an important common feature in that predominant physical behaviors occur at an energy scale comparable with room temperature thermal energy (of order of kT), and that entropy is considered the dominant factor. At these temperatures, quantum aspects are generally unimportant. When soft materials interact favorably with surfaces, they become squashed without an external compressive force.

Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, who has been called the &quot;founding father of soft matter,&quot; received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1991 for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to the more complex cases found in soft matter, in particular, to the behaviors of liquid crystals and polymers.

== History ==
The current understanding of soft matter grew from Albert Einstein&#x27;s work on Brownian motion, understanding that a particle suspended in a fluid must have a similar thermal energy to the fluid itself (of order of &quot;kT&quot;). This work built on established research into systems that would now be considered colloids.

The crystalline optical properties of liquid crystals and their ability to flow were first described by Friedrich Reinitzer in 1888, and further characterized by Otto Lehmann in 1889. The experimental setup that Lehmann used to investigate the two melting points of cholesteryl benzoate are still used in the research of liquid crystals as of about 2019.

In 1920, Hermann Staudinger, recipient of the 1953 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, was the first person to suggest that polymers are formed through covalent bonds that link smaller molecules together. The idea of a macromolecule was unheard of at the time, with the scientific consensus being that the recorded high molecular weights of compounds like natural rubber were instead due to particle aggregation.

The use of hydrogel in the biomedical field was pioneered in 1960 by Drahoslav L√≠m and Otto Wichterle. Together, they postulated that the chemical stability, ease of deformation, and permeability of certain polymer networks in aqueous environments would have a significant impact on medicine, and were the inventors of the soft contact lens.

These seemingly separate fields were dramatically influenced and brought together by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes. The work of de Gennes across different forms of soft matter was key to understanding its universality, where material properties are not based on the chemistry of the underlying structure, more so on the mesoscopic structures the underlying chemistry creates. He extended the understanding of phase changes in liquid crystals, introduced the idea of reptation regarding the relaxation of polymer systems, and successfully mapped polymer behavior to that of the Ising model.

== Distinctive physics ==

Interesting behaviors arise from soft matter in ways that cannot be predicted, or are difficult to predict, directly from its atomic or molecular constituents. Materials termed soft matter exhibit this property due to a shared propensity of these materials to self-organize into mesoscopic physical structures. The assembly of the mesoscale structures that form the macroscale material is governed by low energies, and these low energy associations allow for the thermal and mechanical deformation of the material. By way of contrast, in hard condensed matter physics it is often possible to predict the overall behavior of a material because the molecules are organized into a crystalline lattice with no changes in the pattern at any mesoscopic scale. Unlike hard materials, where only small distortions occur from thermal or mechanical agitation, soft matter can undergo local rearrangements of the microscopic building blocks.

A defining characteristic of soft matter is the mesoscopic scale of physical structures. The structures are much larger than the microscopic scale (the arrangement of atoms and molecules), and yet are much smaller than the macroscopic (overall) scale of the material. The properties and interactions of these mesoscopic structures may determine the macroscopic behavior of the material. The large number of constituents forming these mesoscopic structures, and the large degrees of freedom this causes, results in a general disorder between the large-scale structures. This disorder leads to the loss of long-range order that is characteristic of hard matter.

For example, the turbulent vortices that naturally occur within a flowing liquid are much smaller than the overall quantity of liquid and yet much larger than its individual molecules, and the emergence of these vortices controls the overall flowing behavior of the material. Also, the bubbles that compose a foam are mesoscopic because they individually consist of a vast number of molecules, and yet the foam itself consists of a great number of these bubbles, and the overall mechanical stiffness of the foam emerges from the combined interactions of the bubbles.

Typical bond energies in soft matter structures are of similar scale to thermal energies. Therefore the structures are constantly affected by thermal fluctuations and undergo Brownian motion. The ease of deformation and influence of low energy interactions regularly result in slow dynamics of the mesoscopic structures which allows some systems to remain out of equilibrium in metastable states. This characteristic can allow for recovery of initial state through an external stimulus, which is often exploited in research.

Self-assembly is an inherent characteristic of soft matter systems. The characteristic complex behavior and hierarchical structures arise spontaneously as a system evolves towards equilibrium. Self-assembly can be classified as static when the resulting structure is due to a free energy minimum, or dynamic when the system is caught in a metastable state. Dynamic self-assembly can be utilized in the functional design of soft materials with these metastable states through kinetic trapping. 

Soft materials often exhibit both elasticity and viscous responses to external stimuli such as shear induced flow or phase transitions. However, excessive external stimuli often result in nonlinear responses. Soft matter becomes highly deformed before crack propagation, which differs significantly from the general fracture mechanics formulation. Rheology, the study of deformation under stress, is often used to investigate the bulk properties of soft matter.

== Classes of soft matter ==

Soft matter consists of a diverse range of interrelated systems and can be broadly categorized into certain classes. These classes are by no means distinct, as often there are overlaps between two or more groups.

=== Polymers ===

Polymers are large molecules composed of repeating subunits whose characteristics are governed by their environment and composition. Polymers encompass synthetic plastics, natural fibers and rubbers, and biological proteins. Polymer research finds applications in nanotechnology, from materials science and drug delivery to protein crystallization.

=== Foams ===

Foams consist of a liquid or solid through which a gas has been dispersed to form cavities. This structure imparts a large surface-area-to-volume ratio on the system. Foams have found applications in insulation and textiles, and are undergoing active research in the biomedical field of drug delivery and tissue engineering. Foams are also used in automotive for water and dust sealing and noise reduction. 

=== Gels ===

Gels consist of non-solvent-soluble 3D polymer scaffolds, which are covalently or physically cross-linked, that have a high solvent/content ratio. Research into functionalizing gels that are sensitive to mechanical and thermal stress, as well as solvent choice, has given rise to diverse structures with characteristics such as shape-memory, or the ability to bind guest molecules selectively and reversibly.

=== Colloids ===

Colloids are non-soluble particles suspended in a medium, such as proteins in an aqueous solution. Research into colloids is primarily focused on understanding the organization of matter, with the large structures of colloids, relative to individual molecules, large enough that they can be readily observed.

=== Liquid crystals ===

Liquid crystals can consist of proteins, small molecules, or polymers, that can be manipulated to form cohesive order in a specific direction. They exhibit liquid-like behavior in that they can flow, yet they can obtain close-to-crystal alignment. One feature of liquid crystals is their ability to spontaneously break symmetry. Liquid crystals have found significant applications in optical devices such as liquid-crystal displays (LCD).

=== Biological membranes ===

Biological membranes consist of individual phospholipid molecules that have self-assembled into a bilayer structure due to non-covalent interactions. The localized, low energy associated with the forming of the membrane allows for the elastic deformation of the large-scale structure.

== Experimental characterization ==
Due to the importance of mesoscale structures in the overarching properties of soft matter, experimental work is primarily focused on the bulk properties of the materials. Rheology is often used to investigate the physical changes of the material under stress. Biological systems, such as protein crystallization, are often investigated through X-ray and neutron crystallography, while nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used in understanding the average structure and lipid mobility of membranes.

=== Scattering ===

Scattering techniques, such as wide-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, neutron scattering, and dynamic light scattering can also be used for materials when probing for the average properties of the constituents. These methods can determine particle-size distribution, shape, crystallinity and diffusion of the constituents in the system. There are limitations in the application of scattering techniques to some systems, as they can be more suited to isotropic and dilute samples.

=== Computational ===

Computational methods are often employed to model and understand soft matter systems, as they have the ability to strictly control the composition and environment of the structures being investigated, as well as span from microscopic to macroscopic length scales. Computational methods are limited, however, by their suitability to the system and must be regularly validated against experimental results to ensure accuracy. The use of informatics in the prediction of soft matter properties is also a growing field in computer science thanks to the large amount of data available for soft matter systems.

=== Microscopy ===

Optical microscopy can be used in the study of colloidal systems, but more advanced methods like transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are often used to characterize forms of soft matter due to their applicability to mapping systems at the nanoscale. These imaging techniques are not universally appropriate to all classes of soft matter and some systems may be more suited to one kind of analysis than another. For example, there are limited applications in imaging hydrogels with TEM due to the processes required for imaging. However, fluorescence microscopy can be readily applied. Liquid crystals are often probed using polarized light microscopy to determine the ordering of the material under various conditions, such as temperature or electric field.

== Applications ==
Soft materials are important in a wide range of technological applications, and each soft material can often be associated with multiple disciplines. Liquid crystals, for example, were originally discovered in the biological sciences when the botanist and chemist Friedrich Reinitzer was investigating cholesterols. Now, however, liquid crystals have also found applications as liquid-crystal displays, liquid crystal tunable filters, and liquid crystal thermometers. Active liquid crystals are another example of soft materials, where the constituent elements in liquid crystals can self-propel. 

Polymers have found diverse applications, from the natural rubber found in latex gloves to the vulcanized rubber found in tires. Polymers encompass a large range of soft matter, with applications in material science. An example of this is hydrogel. With the ability to undergo shear thinning, hydrogels are well suited for the development of 3D printing. Due to their stimuli responsive behavior, 3D printing of hydrogels has found applications in a diverse range of fields, such as soft robotics, tissue engineering, and flexible electronics. Polymers also encompass biological molecules such as proteins, where research insights from soft matter research have been applied to better understand topics like protein crystallization.

Foams can naturally occur, such as the head on a beer, or be created intentionally, such as by fire extinguishers. The physical properties available to foams have resulted in applications which can be based on their viscosity, with more rigid and self-supporting forms of foams being used as insulation or cushions, and foams that exhibit the ability to flow being used in the cosmetic industry as shampoos or makeup. Foams have also found biomedical applications in tissue engineering as scaffolds and biosensors.

Historically the problems considered in the early days of soft matter science were those pertaining to the biological sciences. As such, an important application of soft matter research is biophysics, with a major goal of the discipline being the reduction of the field of cell biology to the concepts of soft matter physics. Applications of soft matter characteristics are used to understand biologically relevant topics such as membrane mobility, as well as the rheology of blood.

<text>The Battle Creek River (simply Battle Creek on federal maps) is a river in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, joining it at Battle Creek, Michigan; the Kalamazoo River empties into Lake Michigan.

The river&#x27;s drainage basin is approximately and covers northern Calhoun County, southern Eaton County, and southeastern Barry County in southwest Michigan. The headwaters of the Battle Creek River are at Duck Lake in Clarence Township in northeast Calhoun County, and the stream flows north to the city of Charlotte, then southwest through the village of Bellevue and empties into the Kalamazoo River at the city of Battle Creek. Tributaries of the Battle Creek River include Wanadoga Creek, Ellis Creek, Crooked Brook, Goose Creek, Ackley Creek, Indian Creek, and Big Creek. The river is long with an average gradient of 1.25 feet/mile.

== Toponym ==

The river&#x27;s name, according to local lore, was given after a survey party, led by Col. John Mullet, engaged in hostilities with some local Native Americans in the winter of 1823‚Äì24.

<text>William Whitehead (baptized 12 February 1715 ‚Äì 14 April 1785) was an English poet and playwright. He became Poet Laureate in December 1757 after Thomas Gray declined the position.

==Life==

The son of a baker, Whitehead was born in Cambridge and through the patronage of Henry Bromley, afterwards Baron Montfort, was admitted to Winchester College aged fourteen.

He entered Clare College, Cambridge on a Pyke scholarship in 1735, and became a fellow in 1742 (resigning this in 1746), and admitted Master of Arts in 1743. At Cambridge, Whitehead published an epistle &quot;On the Danger of writing Verse&quot; and some other poems, notably a heroic epistle, &quot;Ann Boleyn to Henry the Eighth&quot; (1743), and a didactic &quot;Essay on Ridicule&quot;, also (1743).

In 1745 Whitehead became the tutor of George Villiers, Viscount Villiers, son of William Villiers, 3rd Earl of Jersey, and took up his residence in London. There he produced two tragedies: &quot;The Roman Father&quot; and &quot;Creusa, Queen of Athens&quot;. The plots of these tragedies are based the &quot;Horace&quot; (1640) of Pierre Corneille, and the &quot;Ion&quot; (c. 414‚Äì412 BC) of Euripides. He accompanied Lord Villiers and George Harcourt, Viscount Nuneham, son of Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt on their Grand Tour between 1754 and 1756.

After Thomas Gray refused the Poet Laureateship, it was passed to Whitehead, who was more acceptable at court as he had been the travelling tutor of George Harcourt, Viscount Nuneham, son of Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt, who was Governor to the Prince of Wales (later George III).

He was appointed Register and Secretary of the Knights Companions of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath.

He died at home in Charles Street, London on 14 April 1785 and is buried in South Audley Street Chapel.

==Poetry and plays==

Much of Whitehead&#x27;s work was well received: his tragedy &quot;The Roman Father&quot; was successfully produced by David Garrick in 1750, &quot;Creusa, Queen of Athens&quot; (1754) was also praised and his sentimental comedies &quot;The School for Lovers&quot; (1762) and &quot;The Trip to Scotland&quot; (1770) were successful.

After being appointed Poet Laureate, Whitehead defended the poetry of Laureates in a comic poem &quot;A Pathetic Apology for All Laureates, Past, Present, And To Come&quot;. He was conscientious and saw himself as a non-partisan representative for the whole country. Astonishingly for a political appointee, he appeared to see no requirement &quot;to defend the King or support the government&quot;. Sadly, this reflects the idea that the Laureate&#x27;s influence had weakened so much that the official poems were unlikely to influence opinions, even though the times were important politically, with rebellion in the American colonies and war in Europe.

For some 28 years in this post, he contented himself in writing the obligatory verse, avoiding flattery and domestic politics, and bolstering Britain‚Äôs place in world affairs. Indeed, he was the first laureate to see past court and party divisions and speak of the ‚Äòspirit of England‚Äô. The odes Whitehead wrote in his capacity as Poet Laureate, however, were ridiculed. Charles Churchill attacked him in 1762, in the third book of &quot;The Ghost&quot;, as &quot;the heir of Dullness and Method&quot;.

Whitehead&#x27;s works were collected in two volumes in 1774. A third, including a memoir by William Mason, appeared posthumously in 1788. His plays are printed in Bell&#x27;s &quot;British Theatre&quot; (vols. 3, 7, 20) and other collections, and his poems appear in Alexander Chalmers&#x27;s &quot;Works of the English Poets&quot; (vol. 17) and similar compilations.

<text>The Symphony No. 2 in D major, Op. 36, is a symphony in four movements written by Ludwig van Beethoven between 1801 and 1802. The work is dedicated to Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky.

== Background ==
Beethoven&#x27;s Second Symphony was mostly written during Beethoven&#x27;s stay at Heiligenstadt in 1802, at a time when his deafness was becoming more pronounced and he began to realize that it might be incurable. The work was premiered in the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on 5 April 1803, and was conducted by the composer. During that same concert, the Third Piano Concerto and the oratorio &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot; were also debuted. It is one of the earliest works of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;middle&quot; period.

Beethoven wrote the Second Symphony without a standard minuet; instead, a scherzo took its place, giving the composition even greater scope and energy. The scherzo and the finale are filled with Beethovenian musical jokes, which shocked the sensibilities of many contemporary critics. One Viennese critic for the &quot;Zeitung fuer die elegante Welt&quot; (Newspaper for the Elegant World) famously wrote of the Symphony that it was &quot;a hideously writhing, wounded dragon that refuses to die, but writhing in its last agonies and, in the fourth movement, bleeding to death.&quot;

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two soprano clarinets in B-flat, two bassoons, two French horns  in F, two trumpets in B-flat (first, third and fourth movements only), timpani (first, third and fourth movements only) and strings. 

Ferdinand Ries, working under Beethoven, made a transcription of the entire symphony for piano trio which bears the same opus number.

== Form ==

This symphony consists of four movements:
#Adagissimo, ‚Äì Allegro con brio, (D major)
#Larghetto, (A major)
#Scherzo: Allegro, (D major)
#Allegrissimo, (D major)

A typical performance runs 30 to 37 minutes.

=== First movement ===
The Introduction, &quot;Adagio molto&quot;, begins in D major, changing to B major in measure 11. In measures 12‚Äì16, it briefly modulates to B major and immediately back to D. The exposition (Allegro con brio) begins in D major with the A theme lasting until measure 57. A transition towards the B theme lasts until measure 72, modulating to A minor at measure 61. The B theme begins in A major at 73, moving to A minor again at 113 with a codetta from measure 117‚Äì136 (moving to D major in measure 120). The development uses material from the A theme, going through several modulations throughout and making use of the main idea from Theme A in sequence. At measure 216, the A theme returns in the recapitulation, lasting until measure 228. There is a transition from 229‚Äì244, bringing back the B theme at measure 245, this time in the tonic key. At 327, B major returns briefly, moving back to D in 334 with a Coda from measures 340‚Äì360.

=== Second movement ===
This movement, &quot;Larghetto&quot;, is in the dominant key of A major and is one of Beethoven&#x27;s longest symphonic slow movements. There are clear indications of the influence of folk music and the pastoral, presaging his Symphony No. 6 (&quot;Pastoral&quot;).

The movement, like the first, is in sonata form. Franz Schubert quoted from the movement in the second movement of his Grand Duo for piano.

=== Third movement ===
This movement, &quot;Scherzo: Allegro&quot;, encloses a melodious oboe and bassoon quartet within a typical-sounding Austrian side-slapping dance.

=== Fourth movement ===
The fourth movement, &quot;Allegro molto&quot;, is composed of very rapid string passages. Musicologist Robert Greenberg of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music describes the highly unusual opening motif as a hiccup, belch or flatulence followed by a groan of pain. According to Greenberg:

Musicologist and composer Brian Townsend refers to this assertion by Greenberg as &quot;an example of musicological overreach&quot;. Greenberg does not cite any references to reinforce this interpretation he puts forth in his courses &quot;The symphonies of Beethoven&quot; and &quot;How to listen to and understand great music&quot;.

<text>2point4 Children is a BBC Television sitcom that was created and written by Andrew Marshall. It follows the lives of the Porters, a seemingly average, working-class London family whose world is frequently turned upside-down by bad luck and bizarre occurrences.

The show was originally broadcast on BBC One from 1991 to 1999, and ran for eight series, concluding on 30 December 1999 with the special episode &quot;The Millennium Experience&quot;. The show is regularly repeated in the UK. In Australia showings are on UKTV. The name of the show comes from the stereotypical average size of a typical nuclear family in the UK at the time of the writing of the first series.

The show regularly picked up audiences of up to 14 million throughout the 1990s, with an average of between 6 and 9¬†million. The final episode was viewed by 9.03¬†million people.

Lead actor Gary Olsen died in 2000, effectively ruling out a return of the show for any further series.

==Plot summary==
The Porters are a working-class family who live in Chiswick, London who at first seem normal enough. Bill is the sensible, level-headed mother who does the cooking and housework whilst working for a bakery with her highly sexed best friend Rona. Ben is the father, who is often just as immature as the children. He runs a heating repair business with his moody and sarcastic assistant Christine.

Jenny is the typical teenage daughter, keen on boys, music and vegetarianism, and David is the mischievous younger brother, who enjoys horror films, aliens and annoying his older sister.

However, the Porters&#x27; world is frequently upended by bizarre occurrences and bad luck. Whether it is dealing with flatulent dogs, a frozen body in a freezer in the front room, or even stumbling across a warehouse filled with Shirley Bassey&#x27;s cast-off ballgowns, anything seems possible in the Porters&#x27; world. Traditionally Christmas episodes would feature characters collectively performing a musical number.

===Guest appearances===
==Episodes==
The show originally ran from 1991 to 1999. 56 episodes were made over eight series, including six Christmas specials in which the cast performed carols or original theme songs. Although the series was made over the course of eight years, the show&#x27;s in-universe timeline appears to be much shorter, with Jenny Porter stated to be 14 in series one, yet only just starting university at age 18 in the final series.

Andrew Marshall wrote all of the episodes, except for three in series seven which were written by Paul Alexander, Simon Braithwaite and Paul Smith.

==Reception==

2point4 Children was critically acclaimed.

In 2004, the series ranked #44 in the BBC television poll, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

==Home media==
BBC Enterprises released a video in 1993, comprising the first three episodes of the series, which are known as: &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, and &quot;When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Go Shopping&quot;.

The first three series were released on Region 2 DVD by Eureka Video in 2005. A box set of the first three series was also made available in 2008, again through Eureka Video, with music changes within the episodes. Eureka Video stated that &quot;sales were not good&quot; and they released no further series. 2Entertain, part of BBC Worldwide, say they have tried many times to license the series for distribution by a third party but the high clearance costs for music and imagery used has been the main deterrent.

A Facebook campaign for a release of the whole series was started in 2009.

The series was added to Britbox on 16 December 2021
In March 2022, all 56 episodes were made available on the BBC iPlayer for one year, however as of 27 July 2024, all 8 series&#x27; are still available to watch on BBC iplayer.

==Remake==
In 1997 a remake of the show debuted in the Netherlands: &quot;Kees &amp; Co&quot; starring Simone Kleinsma. The remake ran for eight series between 1997 and 2006. The first five series were adapted from the original English-language scripts, whilst the last three series featured original storylines and characters. In 2018 it was announced that the remake would return for a ninth series with Kleinsma reprising her role.

<text>Salaspils (; ; ) (literally: &quot;island castle&quot;) is a town in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. It is the administrative centre of Salaspils Municipality. The town is situated on the northern bank of the Daugava river, 18 kilometers to the south-east of the city of Riga.

==History==
Salaspils is one of the oldest settlements in Latvia. Archaeological excavations of 1964‚Äì1975 (during the construction of Riga HES) in ancient settlements, burial grounds and castle mounds give evidence of very dense population of the region. At this time, the remains of 11,000-year-old reindeer hunters were found (the oldest known human settlement in all of Latvia) and 3500-year-old remains of Baltic hunters, buried in hollowed-out oak-tree trunks, were found as well. There is evidence that both Livs and Balts built hill forts in the region.

At the end of the 12th century, German merchants travelled up the Daugava, establishing missionaries among the Livonian settlements. One important centre of Daugava Livonians, the small island MƒÅrti≈Üsala (German:&quot;Kircholm&quot;) had a Christian church as early as 1186. So began the Christianizing and gradual subjection of the local Livonian tribes. In 1206, in the early phases of the Livonian Crusade, the Livonian chieftain Ako organized the first revolt against the German crusaders but suffered defeat.

The Latvian name of the Salaspils &quot;island castle&quot; is probably derived from MƒÅrti≈Üsala Island castle, but the Germanized name Kircholm ‚Äì from the MƒÅrti≈Üsala Island church. Both names were used when referring to the territory on the northern bank of the Daugava.

In 1380 the Livonian Order built the castle (Neu-Kircholm) on the mainland, with St George&#x27;s church by it. The castle was an important support-point outside of Riga, and a small town grew up around it. Both the castle and village were destroyed in 1577 during the Livonian War.

In 1605 the village was a site of the Battle of Kircholm in which forces of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth defeated a much more numerous army of Sweden. This was the biggest battle of the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War. The battle took place near St George&#x27;s church and about 9000 Swedish soldiers were buried there. Two memorial stones in Salaspils commemorate of one of the biggest battles in Europe in the 17th century ‚Äì in memory of the victory of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces. Up to the second part of the 20th century a magnificent 17th century military fortification near the Daugava ‚Äì the Swedish rampart. The destroyed church was renovated in 1631, but later ‚Äì in 1896 and 1923 - rebuilt.

In the 17th‚Äì19th century the surrounding area of Salaspils was governed by the Salaspils Estate which, was established near the destroyed Order&#x27;s castle and was a part of Riga since 1630, and the Kurtes Estate which was situated in the territory of present Lƒ´vzemes street in Salaspils.

The Riga‚ÄìDaugavpils railway opened in 1861, and the new center of the town developed near Salaspils station just opposite the Kurtes Estate. In the second part of the 19th century, military summer camps were organized in the territory of Salaspils and an Orthodox church was built into a garrison. During the World War I, the front line was at Salaspils for two years, and many of the buildings and farmsteads, especially along the river, were destroyed. The infamous battles at NƒÅves Sala and MazƒÅ Jugla were fought nearby.

During the first Republic of Latvia there were three parishes in Salaspils territory ‚Äì Stopi≈Üi, Salaspils (ƒ∂esterciems) and Dole.

=== World War II ===
In 1941, during World War II, German Nazi authorities established the largest civilian concentration camp in the Baltic states 2¬†km northwest of the town of Salaspils.
The Latvian historian Heinrihs Strods and the German Holocaust historians Andrej Angrick and Peter Klein estimate the number of deaths at Salaspils at 2,000‚Äì3,000 in total, including children. At the site of the camp, a major monument complex in remembrance of the Soviet victims of Nazism was opened on 31 October 1967.

In addition, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; operated two sub-camps for Soviet prisoners of war near Salaspils (&quot;Zweiglager-1&quot; and &quot;Zweiglager-2&quot;), both part of &quot;Stalag 350&quot;. The exact numbers of those who died at these two camps is the subject of ongoing debate, but is nowadays estimated at about 1000.

Claims made by Soviet historians that over 100,000 people were killed in Salaspils during the German occupation are nowadays classified as propaganda.
According to Latvian historian Aivars Stranga, the controversial 2006 Russian book &quot;Latvia Under The Yoke of Nazism&quot; revives Soviet-era myths which Holocaust researchers have long since deconstructed.
==City growth in the 1950s and 1960s==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, various industrial enterprises and governmental institutions developed in Salaspils, such as the nuclear plant and four branches of the Academy of Science. Large multi-storied housing blocks appeared to house incoming power plant workers, many of whom were Russians. In a few decades Salaspils transformed from a very peaceful rural settlement to a mikroraion-style town. Due to the rapid development, Soviet authorities ordered construction of the Riga HES and Riga TEC-2. The dam created a massive reservoir that flooded monuments of Salaspils ancient history. The last unsubmerged sections of old Salaspils have been preserved near the Salaspils railway station.
== Demographics ==
Due to the industrial development of Salaspils, the population has reached 21,000. At the 2000 census, 42% of population was Latvian, 42% was Russian and 16% belonged to other ethnic groups.

==Geography==

===The National Botanical Gardens===

The National Botanic Garden of Latvia occupy circa 130 ha in the northern part of Salaspils. The National Botanical Garden is famous for having the richest plant collection in the Baltic States. The gardens are open to visitors, and used for recreation by the inhabitants of Salaspils.

===Nuclear reactor===
The reactor site is located in the forest, to the west of the Institute of Physics, in the northeastern part of the town. The reactor was operational from 1969 to 1998. The plant partook in neutron activation analysis and gamma irradiation for various materials. It was a swimming pool reactor. It is now being demolished.

<text>The (; ORTF; , or French Radio and Television Broadcasting Office) was the national agency charged, between 1964 and 1975, with providing public radio and television in France. All programming, especially news broadcasts, were under strict control of the national government.

==History==

=== Background ===
In 1945, the provisional French government established a public monopoly on broadcasting with the formation of Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise (RDF). This nationalisation of all private radio stations marked the beginning of a new era of state-controlled broadcasting in France. As part of its mandate, the RDF also established a 441-line television station known as &quot;T√©l√©vision fran√ßaise&quot;. This station made use of the frequencies previously utilized by the Nazi-operated &quot;Fernsehsender Paris&quot;. 

In 1949, the RDF underwent a name change to Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise (RTF) in order to reflect the organisation&#x27;s growing focus on television broadcasting. By the end of the year, the RTF had begun transmitting television signals using the new 819-line system, which represented a significant advancement in the technical capabilities of the medium. This development allowed for the transmission of high-quality television signals and paved the way for the widespread adoption of television in France.

=== ORTF era ===
In 1964, the RTF was reformed and renamed into the ORTF. The ORTF aimed to modernise the public broadcasting service in order to better satisfy the needs of the French public in terms of information, culture, education, and entertainment. Despite this goal of modernisation and an expressed commitment to meeting the diverse needs of the public, the ORTF continued to operate under a monopoly. 

From the beginning, the public broadcaster experienced fierce competition from the &quot;peripheral stations&quot;: French-speaking stations aimed at the French public but transmitting on longwave from neighbouring countries, such as Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) from Monaco, Radio Luxembourg (later RTL) from Luxembourg, and Europe 1 from Germany (exceptionally, in 1974, RMC was allowed to set up a transmitter on French territory). 

In October 1967, colour television was introduced on the 625-line second channel. In 1968, advertising was introduced on both television channels, although the &#x27;redevance audiovisuelle&#x27; (Broadcasting licence fee) remained in place.

ORTF employees participated in the May 1968 strikes.

In 1970, during a press conference, Georges Pompidou initiated a will to modernise, affirming that information provided to the ORTF must be free from any outside influence, independent in nature, and impartial in its presentation while stressing that it remains &quot;the voice of France whether we like it or not. &quot; 

A third television channel started broadcasting in December 1972.

=== Dissolution ===
The election of Val√©ry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in 1974 prompted yet another reform. The new liberal administration considered the ORTF to be a relic of Gaullist rule. Furthermore, the ORTF&#x27;s annual budget had grown to an unsustainable 2.4 billion francs per year (approximately ‚Ç¨2 billion in 2022), indicative of the organization&#x27;s overly centralised structure. As a result, on December 31, 1974, law 74-696 (dated August 7, 1974) was implemented, splitting the ORTF into seven successor institutions:
*T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise 1 (TF1)
*Antenne 2 (now France 2)
*France R√©gions 3 (FR3) (now France 3)
*SFP (Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Production) ‚Äì programme production
*INA (Institut National de l&#x27;Audiovisuel) ‚Äì archives
*TDF (T√©l√©diffusion de France) ‚Äì transmission
*Radio France (Soci√©t√© Radio-France) ‚Äì French national and international radio

The changes however did not go into effect until January 6, 1975. Despite the dissolution of the ORTF, the public broadcasting monopoly continued to exist until 1981.

Today only INA and Radio France exist in their original form from 1975. Both TDF and TF1 were privatised (the latter sold to the Bouygues construction company) in 1987. The operations of Antenne 2 and FR3 were re-merged in the early 1990s, into a single entity known today as France T√©l√©visions, which still remains under public ownership. SFP was privatized in 2001 and is now a part of Euro M√©dia France.

== Logo ==
The design of the ORTF logo was mostly influenced by the &quot;three ellipses&quot; symbol of its predecessor, with the addition of the letter &quot;O&quot; to create a fourth ellipse. The logo evokes both the concept of radio waves and an image of an electron, symbolising the Atomic Age.

The ORTF logo prominently appeared during the startup and closedown sequences of their television channels.

== Services ==
When it was dissolved in 1975, the ORTF operated 3 national radio networks, 23 regional radio stations, and 3 television channels in Metropolitan France. 13 of the regional radio stations later became stations of the France Bleu radio network. The other 10, each of which were music only stations, became Fip. It operated an additional 8 radio stations and 7 television stations in the overseas territories.

==Membership of the European Broadcasting Union==
In 1950 the ORTF&#x27;s predecessor, RTF, had been one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Upon the break-up of the ORTF in 1974, French membership of the EBU was transferred to the transmission company TDF, while TF1 became a second French active member. A2, FR3, and SRF became supplementary active members before eventually becoming full members in 1982. In 1983 the French public broadcasters&#x27; membership was transferred to a joint organisation, the Organisme fran√ßais de radiodiffusion et de t√©l√©vision (OFRT). Nine years later, the OFRT was succeeded by the Groupement des Radiodiffuseurs Fran√ßais de l‚ÄôUER (GRF) which currently holds one of the French memberships of the EBU, alongside Europe 1. 

TF1 left the EBU in 2018. Private TV channel Canal+ served as an additional member between 1984 and 2018.

<text>&quot;Pok√©mon&quot;, known in Japan as , is a Japanese anime television series produced by animation studio OLM for TV Tokyo. It is adapted from the &quot;Pok√©mon&quot; video game series published by Nintendo. The series follows the young ten-year-old Pok√©mon trainer Ash Ketchum and his adventures with his electric mouse partner Pikachu (voiced by Ikue ≈åtani), and a varying group of friends in his quest to become a Pok√©mon Master.

For the purposes of this list, the division between seasons of &quot;Pok√©mon&quot; is based on the season divisions used by VIZ Media for North American home video releases. The English episode numbers are based on their first airing either in syndication, on Kids&#x27; WB, Cartoon Network, Disney XD or on Netflix. Subsequent episodes of the English version follow the original Japanese order, except where banned episodes are shown.

<doc id="616318" wikidata="Q1516078" url="?curid=616318" title="VR Troopers">
<text>VR Troopers is a syndicated live-action superhero-adventure television series produced and distributed by Saban Entertainment from 1994 to 1996. The show tried to profit from the fascination with virtual reality in the mid-1990s as well as the success of Saban&#x27;s other property, &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. &quot;VR Troopers&quot; was the first official &quot;sister series&quot; to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. Much like it, this was an Americanization of a Japanese tokusatsu children&#x27;s program series by Toei Company. The series is a co-production of Toei and Cyberprod.

The show featured early CGI and video effects mixed with Japanese stock footage from three different &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot;: &quot;Metalder&quot;, &quot;Spielban&quot; and &quot;Shaider&quot;. On May 7, 2010, the copyright for &quot;VR Troopers&quot; was transferred from BVS Entertainment to Saban Capital Group. In 2018, the rights were transferred to Hasbro, as part of the acquisition of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; brand, which included related intellectual property &amp; content libraries previously owned by Saban Properties.

The show was canceled after only two seasons primarily because the available Japanese footage was quickly exhausted. Its successor, &quot;Big Bad Beetleborgs&quot;, another Saban adaptation of a &quot;Metal Heroes&quot; series, was cancelled for the same reason. The show spawned a toy line and a video game for the Sega Genesis and Game Gear.

==Plot==

The show focused on three teenagers in their late teens, Ryan Steele, Kaitlin Star, and J.B. Reese, living in the fictional West Coast town of Cross World City, California. They regularly attended and were teachers at &quot;Tao&#x27;s Dojo&quot;, a karate studio. Ryan was the most focused martial artist; J.B. was the computer wizard; while Kaitlin was a photographer and budding reporter for the local newspaper, the &quot;Underground Voice Daily&quot;. One day, Ryan&#x27;s search for his long-missing father led him and his two friends to a strange laboratory. Inside, a digitized head of Professor Horatio Hart (who is a friend of Ryan&#x27;s father Tyler) explained the truth about his life&#x27;s work of having developed extremely advanced virtual reality technology in secret. &quot;VR&quot; is a dimension existing alongside our own; within it lie mutants, aiming at conquering both worlds. The main ruler of these is a creature known as Grimlord, who, unbeknownst to anyone on Earth, has a human identity as billionaire industrialist Karl Ziktor. As Karl Ziktor tries to overcome the barriers of the true reality to allow his armies easy passage from the virtual world, the responsibility of defending the planet on both sides of the dimensional barrier falls on Ryan, Kaitlin and J.B.. They have assistance in the form of armored bodies having incredible firepower. This includes eventual additions to their arsenal, such as a Turbo Cycle, Techno Bazooka, VR Troopertron, VR Shoulder Cannon, VR Battlecruiser/Interceptor and a flying, laser-blasting Skybase.

Among other regular characters on the show, Zeb as Jeb, Ryan&#x27;s hound dog that, after an accident in Professor Hart&#x27;s lab, becomes capable of human speech; Woody Stocker, Kaitlin&#x27;s wacky hat-loving boss at the &quot;Underground Voice Daily&quot;; Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Rooney, the local mayor&#x27;s nephew and Kaitlin&#x27;s bumbling rival reporter; and Tao, the wise martial arts sensei who owns the dojo and a family friend of the Steele Family. Recurring villains include General Ivar, Colonel Icebot, Decimator, the Skugs and others throughout.

During the second season, the show changed format very slightly. Ryan&#x27;s father Tyler was finally found and restored to normal. Then he quickly left to help the government research further Virtual Reality based technology. With him came Ryan&#x27;s new V.R. armor and an upgrade to his powers. Grimlord&#x27;s base of operations switched from the virtual dungeon to a massive spacecraft which used mostly US footage and added new Generals such as Oraclon, Despera, Doom Master and his Vixens. The Skugs now had the ability to become more powerful in the form of Ultra Skugs.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
In pre-production, the series was known as &quot;Psycon&quot; and &quot;Cybertron&quot;, focusing on a single hero with a technological theme instead of a team of heroes with a virtual reality theme.

In the &quot;Psycon&quot; pilot script, the main character was Adam Steele who merged with the cyborg Psycon instead of transforming into it. The enemy was Grimlord, whose alter ego was Cyrus Ritker, who led a robot army known as Cyberdrones. Cyrus had a son called Percy who was Adam&#x27;s martial arts rival. Adam&#x27;s mentor and caretaker was a martial arts sensei called Tao. Adam was friends with Tao&#x27;s daughter Mia, and a young kid called Mouse MacKenzie.

The &quot;Cybertron&quot; pilot starred Jason David Frank as Adam Steele and drew its source footage from &quot;Metalder&quot;. Frank&#x27;s character was depicted as a solo hero going up against an army of robots known as Wardrones who were led by Grimlord. Grimlord&#x27;s alter ego in the pilot was Cyrus Rikter (Gardner Baldwin), who had a son named Percy, who was Adam&#x27;s martial arts rival. Tao Chong (Richard Rabago) served as Adam&#x27;s caretaker and mentor. Tao also had a daughter named Mia and Doug Sloan played the part of Tyler Steele in flashbacks. The pilot included a pair of bumbling news reporters named Elmo (played by Jamie Kennedy) and Scuzzy, who would&#x27;ve served as the series&#x27; comic relief. Its theme song was based on Ron Wasserman&#x27;s &quot;Go Green/White Ranger Go&quot; song in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series.

===&quot;VR Troopers&quot;===
In the original &quot;VR Troopers&quot; promo, Kaitlin had the last name of &quot;Hall&quot; instead of &quot;Star&quot; and Professor Hart was played by a different actor with an entirely different voice and personality than the Professor that was later used.

Like &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, &quot;VR Troopers&quot; used a combination of American footage spliced with fight scenes from Japanese shows. The Japanese shows adapted in to &quot;VR Troopers&quot; are &quot;Shaider&quot;, &quot;Spielban&quot;, and &quot;Metalder&quot;. All three come from Toei&#x27;s &quot;Metal Hero Series&quot;. &quot;Metalder&quot; provided footage of Ryan Steele&#x27;s season one robotic suit, Grimlord, the Virtual Dungeon, Grimlord&#x27;s four lieutenants, Dark Heart, and the military-type robots that are featured in several episodes, as well as the exterior of Ziktor Industries. &quot;Spielban&quot; provided footage of J.B.&#x27;s and Kaitlin&#x27;s robotic suits, Ivar, Icebot, skugs, and the battle scenes involving the Skybase, shark cruisers, tanks, and fighter jets. &quot;Space Sheriff Shaider&quot; provided the new footage for season two, including Ryan Steele&#x27;s season two robotic suit and the ultra-skugs.

Out of all of Saban&#x27;s tokusatsu adaptations, &quot;VR Troopers&quot; uses the oldest source-footage of any series. &quot;Shaider&quot; was aired from 1984 to early 1985, making it 10 years old when first used for &quot;VR Troopers&quot; in 1995; &quot;Spielban&quot; was aired from 1986 to early 1987, making it eight years old when originally used in 1994; and &quot;Metalder&quot; was originally aired in 1987 to early 1988, making it seven years old when it was adapted in 1994.

Because more than one Japanese show was used in an episode at any given time, Ryan&#x27;s alter-ego was never in the same action scene as JB or Kaitlin&#x27;s (since they were taken from two different shows). Due to this, many episodes involved some sort of plot device that separated Ryan from the other two, forcing them to fight separately. Almost every episode ended with either Ryan or JB destroying the monster of the day (Kaitlin never got to destroy any on her own), at which point his missing comrade(s) would come running up to inquire how the fight went. The only time the group fought &quot;together&quot; or in battle grid mode was all original American footage, with the Battle Grid suits being low-quality spandex and the helmets simple recolors of the Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger&#x27;s. For the show&#x27;s first season, there was almost never any original American footage outside of the Battle Grid. Similar to &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, more U.S. fights were featured in the show&#x27;s second season.

&quot;VR Troopers&quot; as an adaptation is different in many ways from &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Big Bad Beetleborgs&quot;. Because it was syndicated (instead of broadcast on Fox Kids like the former two), the monsters were destroyed more violently; mutant/robot destructions included the monster being split in half, impaled, and decapitated. None of the VR Trooper forms were given names since none of them had one main color.

All three of the &quot;Metal Hero&quot; shows used in the series had a lot of &quot;human vs. human&quot; battles. However, because the fights featured close-ups of Japanese actors, it was deemed unusable. Distance shots of Japanese actors from &quot;Shaider&quot; were usable in some of the fights, and battles with the monster footage were also kind of limited (splicing up to 2‚Äì3 episodes), but otherwise such footage was limited. In addition, because many episodes of fight footage from &quot;Metalder&quot;/&quot;Shaider&quot; and &quot;Spielban&quot; were being used in a single episode, viable footage was used more quickly.

In Season 1, the show would open with the traditional &quot;Today on &quot;Saban&#x27;s VR Troopers&quot;&quot; teaser, showing scenes from the episode and narrated by Dave Mallow. After the &quot;Quest For Power&quot; mini-series in Season 2, however, Ryan, Kaitlin, or J.B. took over the part and narrated the teaser in first-person).

Various voice actors were listed under different pseudonyms in this series. For example, in the Season 1 end credits, Kerrigan Mahan was credited under his pseudonym, Ryan O&#x27;Flannigan (which was also the name credited for doing the voice of Goldar in the early seasons of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;); in Season 2, he would be credited under his real name and was properly identified as Jeb&#x27;s voiceover. Likewise, Richard Epcar was occasionally listed in the end credits under a pseudonym of his own, Richard George (although he was credited under his real name for the first two episodes of the series), and Mike Reynolds was credited under the name Ray Michaels.

==Home media==
In the U.S., five VHS videos were released: &quot;Lost Memories&quot;, &quot;Oh Brother&quot;, &quot;Computer Captive&quot;, &quot;Error in the System&quot;, and &quot;Virtual V6&quot;. Each VHS release contained a bonus music video.

In the U.K., two videos were released through PolyGram Video and 4 Front Video (a subsidiary of PolyGram), Vol.1 contained &quot;The Battle Begins: Parts 1 and 2&quot; and Vol.2 contains &quot;Battle For The Books&quot; and &quot;Katlin&#x27;s Little Helper&quot;. In the 2000s, four DVDs were released by FOX Kids Europe/Jetix Europe and Maximum Entertainment Ltd. They included three single disc Volumes and a Mega-Disc DVD that contained 8 various episodes that were released across the first three volumes and a couple of episodes that were not released on any of the three previous discs.

On June 15, 2011, all episodes of &quot;VR Troopers&quot; were made available on Netflix until February 1, 2021. In 2015, episodes were available on Kabillion, a video-on-demand service.

On March 12, 2012, it was revealed in &quot;Home Media Magazine&quot; that Power Rangers (&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; to &quot;Power Rangers RPM&quot;), &quot;VR Troopers&quot;, &quot;Big Bad Beetleborgs&quot;/&quot;Beetleborgs Metallix&quot;, and &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot; would be released on DVD through a deal signed by Shout! Factory and Saban Brands.

On October 2, 2012, VR Troopers: Season 1, Volume 1 was released on DVD by Shout! Factory. Shout! Factory released VR Troopers: Season 1, Volume 2 on DVD on January 15, 2013. On May 14, 2013 Shout! Factory released VR Troopers: Season 2, Volume 1 on DVD. VR Troopers: Season 2, Volume 2 on DVD was scheduled for release by Shout! Factory on September 10, 2013. However, due to poor sales of the first three volumes, the release was cancelled.

Season 2, Volume 2 was released as a Shout! Select title on January 14, 2014.

==Other media==
===Comics===

<text>Laurence Eusden (bapt. 6 September 168827 September 1730) was an English poet who became Britain&#x27;s youngest Poet Laureate in 1718.

== Life ==
Laurence Eusden was born in Spofforth in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1688 (date unknown) to the Rev. Laurence Eusden, rector of Spofforth, Yorkshire. Eusden was baptized on 6 September 1688. He received his education at St Peter&#x27;s School, York, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a minor fellow of his college in 1711, and in the next year was admitted to a full fellowship.

Early on, Eusden had decided upon building a career through influence. For someone like him, well-educated, with a fellowship at Trinity, but without family money and without well-placed relations, there was no other way to advance in the world. He began to write, with the intention of using his ability to attract notice to himself. With a flattering poem on the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s marriage he succeeded ‚Äì he was made Poet Laureate in 1718 by Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain.

Eusden, who was thirty years old at the time of his appointment, was also the youngest Poet Laureate. Eusden secured this post due to the death of the previous Poet Laureate, Nicholas Rowe, and the recommendation of Joseph Addison. Upon his appointment, Eusden produced Birthday and New Year Odes for twelve years.

The last few years of his life were unhappy. He was ordained as a cleric in the 1720s, and assumed the office of rector of Coningsby, Lincolnshire, but his elevation to Poet Laureate brought him derision from his social and literary peers. Eusden died at Coningsby on 27 September 1730. He was buried at his church, St Michael and All Angels, in Coningsby.

== Poetry and criticism ==
Eusden&#x27;s work is difficult to find. However, his &quot;The Origin Of The Knights Of The Bath&quot;, dedicated to the young William Augustus, later Duke of Cumberland, is available online. Its first twelve lines are reproduced below as an instance of Eusden&#x27;s laudatory style:

Though he produced many translations and gratulatory poems, Eusden&#x27;s literary reputation is dominated by the satirical allusions of Alexander Pope&#x27;s satire &quot;The Dunciad&quot;: e.g., &quot;Know, Eusden thirsts no more for sack or praise; He sleeps among the dull of ancient days.&quot;

In addition to Pope&#x27;s skewering of Eusden&#x27;s abilities, Thomas Gray, author of &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, said that &quot;&quot;Eusden set out well in life, but afterward turned out a drunkard and besotted his faculties&quot;.&quot;

<text>Captain Blood: His Odyssey is an adventure novel by Rafael Sabatini, originally published in 1922.

==Development==
Sabatini was a proponent of basing historical fiction as closely as possible on history. Although Blood is a fictional character, much of the historical background of the novel is loosely based on fact. A group of Monmouth rebels was indeed condemned to ten years&#x27; hard labor in Barbados, very similar to chattel slavery; and the shifting political alliances of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 are used in the novel as a plot device to allow Blood&#x27;s return to respectability.

Sabatini based the first part of the story of Blood on Henry Pitman, a surgeon who tended the wounded Monmouth rebels and was sentenced to death by Judge Jeffreys, but whose sentence was commuted to penal transportation to Barbados where he escaped and was captured by pirates. Unlike the fictional Blood, Pitman did not join them, and eventually made his way back to England where he wrote a popular account of his ordeal. For Blood&#x27;s life as a buccaneer, Sabatini used several models, including Henry Morgan and the work of Alexandre Exquemelin, for historical details.

Sabatini first introduced the character Captain Blood in a series of eight short stories in &quot;Premier Magazine&quot; as &quot;Tales of the Brethren of the Main&quot;, published from December 1920 to March 1921, and reprinted in &quot;Adventure Magazine&quot; from January to May 1921, with a novella &quot;Captain Blood&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, published in &quot;Premier Magazine&quot; in April 1921 (and &quot;Adventure Magazine&quot; in October 1921). The &quot;Odyssey&quot;-like story arc of these tales was then woven by Sabatini into a continuous narrative in novel form, published as &quot;Captain Blood: His Odyssey&quot; in 1922.

== Synopsis ==

The protagonist is the sharp-witted Dr. Peter Blood, a fictional Irish physician who had had a wide-ranging career as a soldier and sailor (including a commission as a captain under the Dutch admiral De Ruyter) before settling down to practice medicine in the town of Bridgwater in Somerset. The story is told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, who enables the reader to see the thoughts and views of many different characters. The narrator‚Äîperhaps meant to be Sabatini himself‚Äîclaims to have acquired the story from the ship&#x27;s logs of Blood&#x27;s longtime companion Jeremy Pitt. 

The book opens with him attending to his geraniums while the town prepares to fight for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. He wants no part in the rebellion, but while attending to some of the rebels wounded at the Battle of Sedgemoor, Peter is arrested. During the Bloody Assizes, he is convicted by the infamous Judge Jeffreys of treason on the grounds that &quot;if any person be in actual rebellion against the King, and another person‚Äîwho really and actually was not in rebellion‚Äîdoes knowingly receive, harbour, comfort, or succour him, such a person is as much a traitor as he who indeed bore arms.&quot;

The sentence for treason is death by hanging, but King James II, for purely financial reasons, has the sentence for Blood and other convicted rebels commuted to transportation to penal servitude in the Caribbean. Upon arrival on the island of Barbados, Blood is bought by Colonel William Bishop, initially for forced work in the Colonel&#x27;s prison farms but later hired out by Bishop when Blood&#x27;s skills as a physician prove superior to those of the local doctors. During his period of slavery, Blood wins the pity and sympathy of Arabella, Colonel Bishop&#x27;s niece.

When a Spanish force attacks and raids Bridgetown, Blood escapes with a number of other convicts (including former shipmaster Jeremy Pitt, the one-eyed giant Edward Wolverstone, former gentleman Nathaniel Hagthorpe, former Royal Navy petty officer Nicholas Dyke and former Royal Navy master gunner Ned Ogle). The escapees capture the Spaniards&#x27; ship and sail away to become some of the most successful pirates in the Caribbean, hated and feared by the Spanish but always sparing English ships. Colonel Bishop, humiliated by Blood&#x27;s superior abilities and daring escape, devotes himself to capturing and executing Blood.

After the Glorious Revolution, Blood is pardoned. As a reward for saving the colony of Jamaica from a French assault, he is appointed its governor in place of Colonel Bishop, who had abandoned his post to hunt for Blood, and the novel ends with the implication that Blood will not only marry Arabella but will also generously forgive Bishop.

==Influence==

===Continuation===
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; won enormous popularity, but instead of continuing Blood&#x27;s adventures in sequels, Sabatini wrote fifteen more short stories set during Captain Blood&#x27;s pirate career. Two of these tales (&quot;The War Indemnity&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;) may be viewed as continuations of events of the original novel, but all the stories are contained within the timeframe of &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (a sidequel).

Eight of these new stories were published in 1931 as &quot;Captain Blood Returns&quot; (retitled &quot;The Chronicles of Captain Blood&quot; in the British publication) along with two of the &quot;Tales of the Brethren of the Main&quot; that had not been incorporated into &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. A second collection, &quot;The Fortunes of Captain Blood&quot; was published in 1936, consisting of six new stories, and one final story, &quot;The Remedy&quot;, which takes place almost immediately after Blood&#x27;s trial before Judge Jeffreys and in which Peter Blood is not the primary character but is prominently figured. It was also included in Sabatini&#x27;s collection of short stories &quot;Turbulent Tales&quot;, published in 1946.

The book was especially popular in Russia. Several Russian authors wrote moderately popular sequels, such as &quot;Children of Captain Blood&quot; by Tatyana Vinogradova, and &quot;Captain Blood: His Iliad&quot; by Mikhail Popov.

===Literary references===
The bitter aftermath of the Monmouth Rebellion also features prominently in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s novel &quot;Micah Clarke&quot; (1889).

In the opening chapter of Arturo P√©rez-Reverte&#x27;s novel &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; (1993), two characters discuss their favourite novel by Sabatini; book dealer Lucas Corso declares his preference for &quot;Captain Blood&quot;.

Alan Moore&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; incorporates many characters from classic books, including Peter Blood as a member of the Pirates&#x27; Conference in &quot;The New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot; (2002‚Äì2003).

<text>Claude George Bowes-Lyon, 14th and 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, (14 March 1855 ‚Äì 7 November 1944), styled as Lord Glamis from 1865 to 1904, was a British peer and landowner who was the father of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and the maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Life and family==
The Earl was born in Lowndes Square, London, the son of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 13th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and the former Frances Smith. His younger brother, Patrick Bowes-Lyon, was a tennis player who won the 1887 Wimbledon doubles.

After being educated at Eton College, the Earl received a commission in the 2nd Life Guards in 1876 and served for six years until the year after his marriage. He was an active member of the Territorial Army and served as honorary colonel of the 4th/5th Battalion of the Black Watch.
Upon succeeding his father to the Earldom on 16 February 1904, he inherited large estates in Scotland and England, including Glamis Castle, St Paul&#x27;s Walden Bury, Gibside Hall and Streatlam Castle in County Durham and Woolmers Park, near Hertford. He was made Lord Lieutenant of Angus, an office he resigned when his daughter became queen. He had a keen interest in forestry and was one of the first to grow larch from seed in Britain. His estates had a large number of smallholders, and he had a reputation for being unusually kind to his tenants. His contemporaries described him as an unpretentious man, often seen in &quot;an old macintosh tied with a piece of twine&quot;. He worked his own land and enjoyed physical labour on the grounds of his estates; visitors often mistook him for a common labourer. He made his own cocoa for breakfast, and always had a jug of water by his place at dinner so he could dilute his own wine.

Despite the Earl&#x27;s reservations about royalty, in April 1923, his youngest daughter, Elizabeth, married Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. Lord Strathmore was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order to mark the marriage. His granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II), was born at his home, 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair, in April 1926. In 1928, he was made a Knight of the Thistle.

In 1936, his son-in-law became king and assumed the name George VI. As the father of the new queen, he was created a Knight Companion of the Garter and the 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a United Kingdom peerage in the Coronation Honours of 1937 (although he was the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne which was a Scottish title). This enabled him to sit in the House of Lords as an earl (because members of the peerage of Scotland did not automatically sit in the House of Lords, he had previously sat only as a baron through the Barony of Bowes created for his father). At the coronation of his daughter and son-in-law, the Earl and Countess sat in the royal box with Queen Mary and their shared granddaughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.

Later in life, the Earl became extremely deaf. Lord Strathmore died of bronchitis on 7 November 1944, aged 89, at Glamis Castle. (Lady Strathmore had died in 1938.) He was succeeded by his son, Patrick Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck on 16 July 1881 in Petersham, Surrey. The couple had ten children. The Earl would part his moustache in a theatrical, but courteous gesture, before kissing them:

<doc id="616332" wikidata="Q1321760" url="?curid=616332" title="Nasal vowel">
<text>A nasal vowel is a vowel that is produced with a lowering of the soft palate (or velum) so that the air flow escapes through the nose and the mouth simultaneously, as in the French vowel /…ëÃÉ/ () or Amoy []. By contrast, oral vowels are produced without nasalization.

Nasalized vowels are vowels under the influence of neighbouring sounds. For instance, the [] of the word &quot;hand&quot; is affected by the following nasal consonant. In most languages, vowels adjacent to nasal consonants are produced partially or fully with a lowered velum in a natural process of assimilation and are therefore technically nasal, but few speakers would notice. That is the case in English: vowels preceding nasal consonants are nasalized, but there is no phonemic distinction between nasal and oral vowels, and all vowels are considered phonemically oral.

Some languages contrast oral vowels and nasalized vowels phonemically. Linguists make use of minimal pairs to decide whether or not the nasality is of linguistic importance. In French, for instance, nasal vowels are distinct from oral vowels, and words can differ by the vowel quality. The words &quot;beau&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;bon&quot; &quot;good&quot; are a minimal pair that contrasts primarily the vowel nasalization even though the from &quot;bon&quot; is slightly more open.

Portuguese allows nasal diphthongs, which contrast with their oral counterparts, like the pair &quot;mau&quot; &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;m√£o&quot; &quot;hand&quot;.

Although there are French loanwords in English with nasal vowels like &quot;croissant&quot; [], there is no expectation that an English-speaker would nasalize the vowels to the same extent as French-speakers or Portuguese-speakers. Likewise, pronunciation keys in English dictionaries do not always indicate nasalization of French or Portuguese loanwords.

==Influence on vowel height==
Nasalization as a result of the assimilation of a nasal consonant tends to cause a raising of vowel height; phonemically distinctive nasalization tends to lower the vowel. According to a different assessment, high vowels do tend to be lowered, but low vowels tend to be raised instead.

In most languages, vowels of all heights are nasalized indiscriminately, but preference occurs in some languages, such as for high vowels in Chamorro and low vowels in Thai.

==Degree of nasalization==
A few languages, such as Palantla Chinantec, contrast lightly nasalized and heavily nasalized vowels. They may be contrasted in print by doubling the IPA diacritic for nasalization: vs . Bickford &amp; Floyd (2006) combine the tilde with the ogonek: vs . (The ogonek is sometimes used in an otherwise IPA transcription to avoid conflict with tone diacritics above the vowels.)

==Origin==
Rodney Sampson described a three-stage historical account, explaining the origin of nasal vowels in modern French. The notation of Terry and Webb is used below, where V, N, and ·πº (with a tilde above) represent oral vowel, nasal consonant, and nasal vowel, respectively.

In the Old French period, vowels became nasalized under the regressive assimilation, as VN &gt; ·πºN. In the Middle French period, the realization of the nasal consonant became variable, as VN &gt; ·πº(N). As the language evolves into its modern form, the consonant is no longer realized, as ·πºN &gt; ·πº.

==Orthography==

Languages written with Latin script may indicate nasal vowels by a trailing silent &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot;, as is the case in French, Portuguese, Lombard (central classic orthography), Bamana, Breton, and Yoruba.

In other cases, they are indicated by diacritics. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, nasal vowels are denoted by a tilde over the symbol for the vowel. The same practice can be found in Portuguese marking with a tilde in diphthongs (e.g. &quot;p√µe&quot;) and for words ending in /…êÃÉ/ (e.g. &quot;manh√£&quot;, &quot;irm√£&quot;). While the tilde is also used for this purpose in Paraguayan Guaran√≠, phonemic nasality is indicated by a diaeresis ( ¬® ) in the standardized orthographies of most varieties of Tup√≠-Guaran√≠ spoken in Bolivia. Polish, Navajo, and Elfdalian use a hook under the letter, called an ogonek, as in &quot;ƒÖ, ƒô&quot;. The PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´ romanization of Taiwanese Hokkien and Amoy uses a superscript &quot;n&quot; (&quot;a‚Åø&quot;, &quot;e‚Åø&quot;, ...). In the orthography of the First Grammatical Treatise for the Old Icelandic language, nasal vowels are indicated with a dot above the vowel grapheme: a /…ë/ vs »ß /…ëÃÉ/, «´ /…î/ vs «´Ãá /…îÃÉ/, e /e/ vs. ƒó /·∫Ω/ vs ƒô /…õ/ vs. ƒôÃá /…õÃÉ/, ƒ± /i/ vs i /ƒ©/, o /o/ vs »Ø /√µ/, √∏ /√∏/ vs. √∏Ãá /√∏ÃÉ/, u /u/ vs uÃá /≈©/, y /y/ vs ·∫è /·ªπ/; the ogonek instead indicates retracted tongue root or tense vowels, cf. «´ /…î/ vs o /o/ and e /e/ vs. ƒô /…õ/. 

=== Arabic scripts ===

==== Indo-Aryan ====
Nasalization in Arabic-based scripts of languages such as Urdu, as well as Punjabi and Saraiki, commonly spoken in Pakistan, and by extension India, is indicated by employing the nasal vowel, a dotless form of the Arabic letter n≈´n () or the letter marked with the &quot;maghn≈´na&quot; diacritic: respectively , always occurring word finally, or in the medial form, called &quot;n≈´n ghunna&quot;. In Sindhi, nasalization is represented with the standard nun letter. 

==== Classical Arabic ====
Nasalized vowels occur in Classical Arabic but not in contemporary speech or Modern Standard Arabic. There is no orthographic way to denote the nasalization, but it is systematically taught as part of the essential rules of &quot;tajwid&quot;, used to read the Qur&#x27;an. Nasalization occurs in recitation, usually when a final n≈´n is followed by a yƒÅ æ ().

=== Indic scripts ===
The Brahmic scripts used for most Indic languages mark nasalization with the anusvƒÅra (‚óå‡§Ç), homophonically used for homorganic nasalization in a consonant cluster following the vowel) or the anunƒÅsika (‚óå‡§Å) diacritic (and its regional variants).

<text>In phonetics, nasalization (or nasalisation in British English) is the production of a sound while the velum is lowered, so that some air escapes through the nose during the production of the sound by the mouth. An archetypal nasal sound is .

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, nasalization is indicated by printing a tilde diacritic above the symbol for the sound to be nasalized: is the nasalized equivalent of , and is the nasalized equivalent of . A subscript diacritic , called an or , is sometimes seen, especially when the vowel bears tone marks that would interfere with the superscript tilde. For example, are more legible in most fonts than .

==Nasal vowels==

Many languages have nasal vowels to different degrees, but only a minority of world languages around the world have nasal vowels as contrasting phonemes. That is the case, among others, of French, Portuguese, Hindustani, Nepali, Breton, Gheg Albanian, Hmong, Hokkien, Yoruba, and Cherokee. Those nasal vowels contrast with their corresponding oral vowels. Nasality is usually seen as a binary feature, although surface variation in different degrees of nasality caused by neighboring nasal consonants has been observed.

===Degree of nasality===
There are languages, such as in Palantla Chinantec, where vowels seem to exhibit three contrastive degrees of nasality: oral e.g. vs lightly nasalized vs heavily nasalized , although Ladefoged and Maddieson believe that the lightly nasalized vowels are best described as oro-nasal diphthongs. Note that Ladefoged and Maddieson&#x27;s transcription of heavy nasalization with a double tilde might be confused with the extIPA adoption of that diacritic for velopharyngeal frication.

==Nasal consonants==

By far the most common nasal sounds are nasal consonants such as , or . Most nasal consonants are occlusives, and airflow through the mouth is blocked and redirected through the nose. Their oral counterparts are the stops.

===Nasalized consonants===
Nasalized versions of other consonant sounds also exist but are much rarer than either nasal occlusives or nasal vowels. The Middle Chinese consonant (; in modern Standard Chinese) has an odd history; for example, it has evolved into and (or and respectively, depending on accents) in Standard Chinese; / and in Hokkien; / and / while borrowed into Japan. It seems likely that it was once a nasalized fricative, perhaps a palatal .

In Coatzospan Mixtec, fricatives and affricates are nasalized before nasal vowels even when they are voiceless. In the Hupa, the velar nasal often has the tongue not make full contact, resulting in a nasalized approximant, . That is cognate with a nasalized palatal approximant in other Athabaskan languages.

In Umbundu, phonemic contrasts with the (allophonically) nasalized approximant and so is likely to be a true fricative rather than an approximant. In Old and Middle Irish, the lenited was a nasalized bilabial fricative .

Ganza has a phonemic nasalized glottal stop while Sundanese has it allophonically; nasalized stops can occur only with pharyngeal articulation or lower, or they would be simple nasals. Nasal flaps are common allophonically. Many West African languages have a nasal flap (or ) as an allophone of before a nasal vowel; voiced retroflex nasal flaps are common intervocalic allophones of in South Asian languages.

A nasal trill has been described from some dialects of Romanian, and is posited as an intermediate historical step in rhotacism. However, the phonetic variation of the sound is considerable, and it is not clear how frequently it is actually trilled. Some languages contrast like Toro-tegu Dogon and Inor. A nasal lateral has been reported for some languages, Nzema language contrasts .

Other languages, such as the Khoisan languages of Khoekhoe and G«Äui, as well as several of the !Kung languages, include nasal click consonants. Nasal clicks are typically with a nasal or superscript nasal preceding the consonant (for example, velar-dental or and uvular-dental or ). Nasalized laterals such as (a nasalized lateral alveolar click) are easy to produce but rare or nonexistent as phonemes; nasalized lateral clicks are common in Southern African languages such as Zulu. Often when is nasalized, it becomes .

==True nasal fricatives==
Besides nasalized oral fricatives, there are true nasal fricatives, or &quot;anterior nasal fricatives&quot;, previously called &quot;nareal fricatives&quot;. They are sometimes produced by people with disordered speech. The turbulence in the airflow characteristic of fricatives is produced not in the mouth but at the anterior nasal port, the narrowest part of the nasal cavity. (Turbulence can also be produced at the posterior nasal port, or velopharyngeal port, when that port is narrowed ‚Äì see velopharyngeal fricative. With anterior nasal fricatives, the velopharyngeal port is open.) A superimposed homothetic sign that resembles a colon divided by a tilde is used for this in the extensions to the IPA: is a voiced alveolar nasal fricative, with no airflow out of the mouth, and is the voiceless equivalent; is an oral fricative with simultaneous nasal frication. No known language makes use of nasal fricatives in non-disordered speech.

==Denasalization==

Nasalization may be lost over time. There are also denasal sounds, which sound like nasals spoken with a head cold. They may be found in non-pathological speech as a language loses nasal consonants, as in Korean.

==Contextual nasalization==
Vowels assimilate to surrounding nasal consonants in many languages, such as Thai, creating nasal vowel allophones. Some languages exhibit a nasalization of segments adjacent to phonemic or allophonic nasal vowels, such as Apurin√£.

Contextual nasalization can lead to the addition of nasal vowel phonemes to a language. That happened in French, most of whose final consonants disappeared, but its final nasals made the preceding vowels become nasal, which introduced a new distinction into the language. An example is , ultimately from Latin and .

<doc id="616335" wikidata="Q1095146" url="?curid=616335" title="Pacta conventa">
<text>Pacta conventa (Latin for &quot;articles of agreement&quot;) was a contractual agreement entered into between the &quot;Polish nation&quot; (i.e., the szlachta (nobility) of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth) and a newly elected king upon his &quot;free election&quot; (&quot;wolna elekcja&quot;) to the throne from 1573 to 1764. It declared policies the King would enact once on the throne.

The document was drawn up by the convocation sejm, which elected the King. The &quot;pacta conventa&quot; affirmed the king-elect&#x27;s pledge to respect the laws of the Commonwealth and specified policies to be enacted in foreign policy, state finances, the armed forces, public works and other areas. An example of the various concrete undertakings found in a king-elect&#x27;s &quot;pacta conventa&quot; is King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa&#x27;s pledge to create a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Navy for the Baltic Sea. Each King&#x27;s &quot;pacta conventa&quot; was different based on the specific policies he had promised in order to be elected, making it somewhat similar to a modern political platform or manifesto.

In addition to his own unique &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, each king-elect was required to sign the Henrician Articles, a set of privileges named after the first king who signed them, Henry of Poland. Unlike the &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, the Henrician Articles were constant and unchanging. The distinction between the two documents gradually faded away over successive elections. Together, those two documents spelled out most of the critical details of the Commonwealth political system.

<doc id="616340" wikidata="Q1444571" url="?curid=616340" title="Franking">
<text>Franking comprises all devices, markings, or combinations thereof (&quot;franks&quot;) applied to mails of any class which qualifies them to be postally serviced. Types of franks include uncanceled and precanceled postage stamps (both adhesive and printed on postal stationery), impressions applied via postage meter (via so-called &quot;postage evidencing systems&quot;), official use &quot;Penalty&quot; franks, Business Reply Mail (BRM), and other permit Imprints (Indicia), manuscript and facsimile &quot;franking privilege&quot; signatures, &quot;soldier&#x27;s mail&quot; markings, and any other forms authorized by the 192 postal administrations that are members of the Universal Postal Union.

==Types and methods==

While all affixed postage stamps and other markings applied to mail to qualify it for postal service is franking, not all types and methods are used to frank all types or classes of mails. Each of the world&#x27;s national and other postal administrations establishes and regulates the specific methods and standards of franking as they apply to domestic operations within their own postal systems. Although there are differences in the manner that the postal systems of the 192 nations that belong to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) apply and regulate the way their mails are franked, most mail types fall under one (and sometimes more) of four major types and/or methods of franking: postage (stamps, etc.), privilege, official business, and business reply mail.

Any and all conflicts that might arise affecting the franking of mail types serviced by multiple administrations which result from differences in these various postal regulations and/or practices are mediated by the UPU, a specialized agency of the United Nations which sets the rules and technical standards for international mail exchanges. The UPU co-ordinates the application of the regulations of postal systems of its member nations, including as they relate to franking, to permit the servicing and exchange of international mail. Prior to the establishment of the UPU in 1874, international mails sometimes bore mixed franking (the application of franking of more than one country) before the world&#x27;s postal services universally agreed to deliver international mails bearing only the franking of the country of origin.

===Postage (stamps, etc)===
&quot;Postage&quot; franking is the physical application and presence of postage stamps, or any other markings recognized and accepted by the postal system or systems providing service, which indicate the payment of sufficient fees for the class of service which the item of mail is to be or had been afforded. Prior to the introduction to the world&#x27;s first postage stamps in Britain in 1840 (&quot;Penny Black&quot;) and 1841 (&quot;Penny Red&quot;), pre-paid franking was applied exclusively by a manuscript or handstamped &quot;Paid&quot; marking and the amount of the fee collected. The first US postage stamp was the red brown Five cent Franklin (SC-1) issued in 1847.
In addition to stamps, postage franking can be in the form of printed or stamped impressions made in an authorized format and applied directly by a franking machine, postage meter, computer generated franking labels or other similar methods (&quot;Postage Evidencing Systems&quot;), any form of preprinted &quot;Postage Paid&quot; notice authorized by a postal service permit (&quot;Indicia&quot;), or any other marking method accepted by the postal service and specified by its regulations, as proof of the prepayment of the appropriate fees. Postal franking also includes &quot;Postage Due&quot; stamps or markings affixed by a postal service which designate any amount of insufficient or omitted postage fees to be collected on delivery. Some countries allow senders to purchase one-time codes online that can be hand-written onto the piece of mail, such as the Netherlands&#x27; Postzegelcodes introduced in 2013.

===Franking privilege===

 &quot;Privilege&quot; franking is a personally pen-signed or printed facsimile signature of a person with a &quot;franking privilege&quot; such as certain government officials (especially legislators) and others designated by law or postal regulations. This allows the letter or other parcel to be sent without the application of a postage stamp. In the United States this is called the &quot;Congressional frank&quot; which can only be used for &quot;Official Business&quot; mail.

In addition to this type of franking privilege, from time to time (especially during wartimes) governments and/or postal administrations also authorize active duty service members and other designated individuals to send mail for free by writing &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Mail&quot; (or equivalent) on the item of mail in lieu of paid postal franking, or by using appropriate free franked postal stationery. In the United States, unless otherwise designated, such mail is serviced by both the military and civil postal systems that accept them as First Class letter mail.

===&quot;Official Business&quot;===
&quot;Official Business&quot; franking is any frank printed on or affixed to mail which is designated as being for official business of national governments (i.e. governments which also have postal administrations) and thus qualify for postal servicing without any additional paid franking. In Commonwealth countries the printed frank reads &quot;Official Paid&quot; and is used by government departments on postmarks, stationery, adhesive labels, official stamps, and handstruck or machine stamps.

In Canada, the monarch, the Governor General, members of the Senate of Canada, members of the House of Commons, the Clerk of the House of Commons, Parliamentary Librarian, Associate Parliamentary Librarian, officers of parliament, and the Senate Ethics Officer all have franking privilege, and mail sent to or from these people are sent free of charge. Bulk mail from members of the House of Commons is limited to four mailings per year and to the member&#x27;s own electoral district. Individuals may send letters to any of the above office-holders without charge.

In the United States, such mails are sent using postal stationery or address labels that include a &quot;Penalty&quot; frank (&quot;Penalty For Private Use To Avoid Payment of Postage $300&quot;) printed on the piece of mail, and/or is franked with Penalty Mail Stamps (PMS) of appropriate value. Such mails are generally serviced as First Class Mail (or equivalent) unless otherwise designated (such as &quot;bulk&quot; mailings).

===&quot;Business Reply Mail&quot;===
&quot;Business Reply Mail&quot; (BRM) franking is a preprinted frank with a Permit number which authorizes items so marked to be posted as First Class Mail with the authorizing postal service without advance payment by the person posting the item. (International Reply Mail may specify Air Mail as the class of service.) Postage fees for BRM are paid by the permit holder upon its delivery to the specified address authorized by the permit and preprinted on the item of business reply mail. Governments also use BRM to permit replies associated with official business purposes.

==History of the &quot;franking privilege&quot;==

A limited form of franking privilege originated in the British Parliament in 1660, with the passage of an act authorizing the formation of the General Post Office. By 1772, the abundance of franked letters represented lost revenue of more than one third the total collections of the Post Office. In the 19th century, as use of the post office increased significantly in Britain, it was expected that anybody with a Parliament connection would get his friends&#x27; mail franked.

In the United States, the franking privilege predates the establishment of the republic itself, as the Continental Congress bestowed it on its members in 1775. The First United States Congress enacted a franking law in 1789 during its very first session. Congress members would spend much time &quot;inscribing their names on the upper right-hand corner of official letters and packages&quot; until the 1860s for the purpose of sending out postage-free mail. Yet, on January 31, 1873, the Senate abolished &quot;the congressional franking privilege after rejecting a House-passed provision that would have provided special stamps for the free mailing of printed Senate and House documents.&quot; Within two years, however, Congress began to make exceptions to this ban, including free mailing of the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, seeds, and agricultural reports. Finally, in 1891, noting that its members were the only government officials required to pay postage, Congress restored full franking privileges. Since then, the franking of congressional mail has been subject to ongoing review and regulation.

The phrase franking is derived from the Franks, a Germanic tribe that conquered Gallia‚Äîmodern-day France‚Äîduring the last days of the Western Roman Empire. The Franks held more legal rights than the Gallo-Roman natives. To be a Frank was to be &quot;free&quot; under the law. Another use of that term is speaking &quot;frankly&quot;, i.e. &quot;freely&quot;. Because Benjamin Franklin was an early United States Postmaster General, satirist Richard Armour referred to free congressional mailings as the &quot;Franklin privilege.&quot;

The use of a franking privilege is not absolute but is generally limited to official business, constituent bulk mails, and other uses as prescribed by law, such as the &quot;Congressional Frank&quot; afforded to Members of Congress in the United States. This is not &quot;free&quot; franking, however, as each member is appropriated a budgeted amount to compensate the USPS for servicing the mail.

A six-member bipartisan Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, colloquially known as the &quot;Franking Commission,&quot; is responsible for oversight and regulation of the franking privilege in the Congress. Among the Commission&#x27;s responsibilities is to establish the &quot;Official Mail Allowance&quot; for each Member based proportionally on the number of constituents they serve. Certain other persons are also accorded the privilege such as Members-elect and former presidents and their spouse or widow as well. A president who is convicted in the Senate as a result of an impeachment trial would not have a franking privilege after being forced to leave office. The sitting president does not have personal franking privileges but the vice president, who is also President of the Senate, does.

In Italy, mail sent &quot;to&quot; the President was free of charge until this franking privilege was abolished in 1999.

In New Zealand, individuals writing to a Member of Parliament can do so without paying for postage.

<doc id="616348" wikidata="Q593283" url="?curid=616348" title="Molniya (satellite)">
<text>The Molniya (, &quot;Lightning&quot;) series satellites were military and communications satellites launched by the Soviet Union from 1965 to 1991, and by the Russian Federation from 1991 to 2004. These satellites used highly eccentric elliptical orbits known as Molniya orbits, which have a long dwell time over high latitudes. They are suited for communications purposes in polar regions, in the same way that geostationary satellites are used for equatorial regions.

There were 164 Molniya satellites launched, all in Molniya orbits with the exception of Molniya 1S which was launched into geostationary orbit for testing purposes.

==History==
In the early 1960s, when Europe and America were establishing geostationary communication satellites, the Russians found these orbits unsuitable. They were limited in the amount of rocket power available and it is extremely energy intensive to both launch a satellite to 40,000 km, and change its inclination to be over the equator, especially when launched from Russia. Additionally geostationary satellites give poor coverage in polar regions. A large portion of Russian territory consists of polar regions, making this arrangement further unfavorable to Russian interests. As a result, OKB-1 sought to find a more optimal orbit for the satellite. Studies found that this could be achieved using a large elliptical orbit, with an apogee over Russian territory. The satellite&#x27;s name, &quot;quick as lightning&quot;, is in reference to the speed with which it passes through the perigee.

Molniya series satellites were replaced (succeeded) by the Meridian series, with the first launch in 2006. , there are currently 36 Molniya satellites left in orbit.

== Molniya 1 ==
The Molniya programme was authorized on 30 October 1961 and design was handled by OKB-1. They were based on the KAUR-2 satellite bus, with design finishing in 1963. The first launch took place on 4 June 1964 and ended in failure when the 8K78 booster core stage lost thrust 287 seconds into launch due to a jammed servo motor. The next attempt was on 22 August 1964 and reached orbit successfully, but the parabolic communications antennas did not properly deploy due to a design flaw in the release mechanism. Publicly referred to as Kosmos 41, it nonetheless operated for nine months. The first operational satellite, Molniya 1-1, was successfully launched on 23 April 1965. By 30 May 1966, the third Molniya 1 had taken the first images of the whole Earth in history.

The early Molniya-1 satellites were designed for television, telegraph and telephone across Russia, but they were also fitted with cameras used for weather monitoring, and possibly for assessing clear areas for Zenit spy satellites. The system was operational by 1967, with the construction of the Orbita groundstations.

They had a lifespan of approximately 1.5 years, as their orbits were disrupted by perturbations, as well as deteriorating solar arrays and they had to be constantly replaced.

By the 1970s, the Molniya 1 series (and the upgrade Molniya 1T) was mostly used for military communications, with civilian communications moving to Molniya 2.

In total 94 Molniya 1 series satellites were launched, with the last going up in 2004.

== Molniya 2 ==
The first Molniya 2 satellites were tested from 1971 with the first operational satellite launching in 1974 from Plesetsk. The used the same satellite bus and basic design as later model Molniya 1 satellites, but with an expanded number of users under the military&#x27;s Unified System of Satellite Communications (YeSSS) program. Development was difficult because the final satellite bus was unpressurized, changing their selection of radios.

These satellites were used in the Soviet national Orbita television network, which had been established a few years earlier in 1967.

Only seventeen Molniya 2 series satellite were launched, as they were soon superseded by the Molniya 3.

== Molniya 3 ==
Originally called the Molniya-2M, their development began in 1972, with launches from 1974. They were also based on the KAUR-2 bus, launching solely from Plesetsk. Earlier models were used for civilian communications in a similar orbit, but different purpose, to the military-only Molniya-1 satellites. From 1980s they were used by the military, and by the 1990s they were operated in the same manner as the Molniya 1 satellites.

A total of 53 Molniya 3 series satellites were launched, with the last one going up in 2003.

== Orbital Properties ==

A typical Molniya series satellite, has:
* Semi-major axis: 26,600 km
* Eccentricity: 0.74
* Inclination: 63.4¬∞ 
* Argument of perigee: 270¬∞
* Period: 718 minutes 

=== Inclination ===
In general, the oblateness of the Earth perturbs the argument of perigee (formula_1), so that even if the apogee started near the north pole, it would gradually move unless constantly corrected with station-keeping thruster burns. Keeping the dwell point over Russia, and useful for communications necessitated without excessive fuel use meant that the satellites needed an inclination of 63.4¬∞, for which these perturbations are zero.

=== Period ===
Similarly, to ensure the ground track repeats every 24 hours the nodal period needed to be half a sidereal day.

=== Eccentricity ===
To maximise the dwell time the eccentricity, the differences in altitudes of the apogee and perigee, had to be large.

However, the perigee needed to be far enough above the atmosphere to avoid drag, and the orbital period needed to be approximately half a sidereal day. These two factors constrained the eccentricity to become approximately 0.737.

<text>In phonetics and phonology, a sonorant or resonant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow in the vocal tract; these are the manners of articulation that are most often voiced in the world&#x27;s languages. Vowels are sonorants, as are semivowels like and , nasal consonants like and , and liquid consonants like and . This set of sounds contrasts with the obstruents (stops, affricates and fricatives).

For some authors, only the term &quot;resonant&quot; is used with this broader meaning, while &quot;sonorant&quot; is restricted to the consonantal subset‚Äîthat is, nasals and liquids only, not vocoids (vowels and semivowels).

==Types==
Whereas obstruents are frequently voiceless, sonorants are almost always voiced. In the sonority hierarchy, all sounds higher than fricatives are sonorants. They can therefore form the nucleus of a syllable in languages that place that distinction at that level of sonority; see Syllable for details.

Sonorants contrast with obstruents, which do stop or cause turbulence in the airflow. The latter group includes fricatives and stops (for example, and ).

Among consonants pronounced in the back of the mouth or in the throat, the distinction between an approximant and a voiced fricative is so blurred that no language is known to contrast them. Thus, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal fricatives never contrast with approximants.

===Voiceless===
Voiceless sonorants are rare; they occur as phonemes in only about 5% of the world&#x27;s languages. They tend to be extremely quiet and difficult to recognise, even for those people whose language has them.

In every case of a voiceless sonorant occurring, there is a contrasting voiced sonorant. In other words, whenever a language contains a phoneme such as , it also contains a corresponding voiced phoneme such as .

Voiceless sonorants are most common around the Pacific Ocean (in Oceania, East Asia, and North and South America) and in certain language families (such as Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dene and Eskimo‚ÄìAleut).

One European language with voiceless sonorants is Welsh. Its phonology contains a phonemic voiceless alveolar trill , along with three voiceless nasals: velar, alveolar and labial.

Another European language with voiceless sonorants is Icelandic, with [lÃ• rÃ• nÃ• mÃ• …≤Ãä ≈ãÃä] for the corresponding voiced sonorants [l r n m …≤ ≈ã].

Voiceless and possibly are hypothesized to have occurred in various dialects of Ancient Greek. The Attic dialect of the Classical period likely had as the regular allophone of at the beginning of words and possibly when it was doubled inside words. Hence, many English words from Ancient Greek roots have &quot;rh&quot; initially and &quot;rrh&quot; medially: &quot;rhetoric&quot;, &quot;diarrhea&quot;.

==Examples==
English has the following sonorant consonantal phonemes: .

Old Irish had one of the most complex sonorant systems recorded in linguistics, with 12 coronal sonorants alone. Coronal laterals, nasals, and rhotics had a fortis‚Äìlenis and a palatalization contrast: . There were also and , making 16 sonorant phonemes in total.

==Sound changes==
Voiceless sonorants have a strong tendency to either revoice or undergo fortition, for example to form a fricative like or .

In connected, continuous speech in North American English, and are usually flapped to following sonorants, including vowels, when followed by a vowel or syllabic .

<doc id="616351" wikidata="Q1063974" url="?curid=616351" title="Molniya orbit">
<text>A Molniya orbit (, &quot;Lightning&quot;) is a type of satellite orbit designed to provide communications and remote sensing coverage over high latitudes. It is a highly elliptical orbit with an inclination of 63.4 degrees, an argument of perigee of 270 degrees, and an orbital period of approximately half a sidereal day. The name comes from the &quot;Molniya&quot; satellites, a series of Soviet/Russian civilian and military communications satellites which have used this type of orbit since the mid-1960s. A variation on the Molniya orbit is the so-called Three Apogee (TAP) orbit, whose period is a third of a sidereal day.

The Molniya orbit has a long dwell time over the hemisphere of interest, while moving very quickly over the other. In practice, this places it over either Russia or Canada for the majority of its orbit, providing a high angle of view to communications and monitoring satellites covering these high-latitude areas. Geostationary orbits, which are necessarily inclined over the equator, can only view these regions from a low angle, hampering performance. In practice, a satellite in a Molniya orbit serves the same purpose for high latitudes as a geostationary satellite does for equatorial regions, except that multiple satellites are required for continuous coverage.

Satellites placed in Molniya orbits have been used for television broadcasting, telecommunications, military communications, relaying, weather monitoring, early warning systems and classified surveillance purposes.

==History==
The Molniya orbit was discovered by Soviet scientists in the 1960s as a high-latitude communications alternative to geostationary orbits, which require large launch energies to achieve a high perigee and to change inclination to orbit over the equator (especially when launched from Russian latitudes). As a result, OKB-1 sought a less energy-demanding orbit. Studies found that this could be achieved using a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee over Russian territory. The orbit&#x27;s name refers to the &quot;lightning&quot; speed with which the satellite passes through the perigee.

The first use of the Molniya orbit was by the communications satellite series of the same name. After two launch failures, and one satellite failure in 1964, the first successful satellite to use this orbit, Molniya 1-1, launched on 23 April 1965. The early Molniya-1 satellites were used for civilian television, telecommunication and long-range military communications, but they were also fitted with cameras used for weather monitoring, and possibly for assessing clear areas for Zenit spy satellites. The original Molniya satellites had a lifespan of approximately 1.5 years, as their orbits were disrupted by perturbations, and they had to be constantly replaced.

The succeeding series, the Molniya-2, provided both military and civilian broadcasting and was used to create the Orbita television network, spanning the Soviet Union. These were in turn replaced by the Molniya-3 design. A satellite called Mayak was designed to supplement and replace the Molniya satellites in 1997, but the project was cancelled, and the Molniya-3 was replaced by the Meridian satellites, the first of which launched in 2006. The Soviet US-K early warning satellites, which watch for American rocket launches, were launched in Molniya orbits from 1967, as part of the Oko system.

From 1971, the American Jumpseat and Trumpet military satellites were launched into Molniya orbits (and possibly used to intercept Soviet communications from the Molniya satellites). Detailed information about both projects remains classified . This was followed by the American SDS constellation, which operates with a mixture of Molniya and geostationary orbits. These satellites are used to relay signals from lower flying satellites back to ground stations in the United States and have been active in some capacity since 1976. A Russian satellite constellation called Tyulpan was designed in 1994 to support communications at high latitudes, but it did not progress past the planning phase.

In 2015 and 2017 Russia launched two &quot;Tundra&quot; satellites into a Molniya orbit, despite their name, as part of its EKS early warning system.


==Uses==

Much of the area of the former Soviet Union, and Russia in particular, is located at high northern latitudes. To broadcast to these latitudes from a geostationary orbit (above the Earth&#x27;s equator) requires considerable power due to the low elevation angles, and the extra distance and atmospheric attenuation that comes with it. Sites located above 81¬∞ latitude are unable to view geostationary satellites at all, and as a rule of thumb, elevation angles of less than 10¬∞ can cause problems, depending on the communications frequency.

A satellite in a Molniya orbit is better suited to communications in these regions, because it looks more directly down on them during large portions of its orbit. With an apogee altitude as high as and an apogee sub-satellite point of 63.4 degrees north, it spends a considerable portion of its orbit with excellent visibility in the northern hemisphere, from Russia as well as from northern Europe, Greenland and Canada.

While satellites in Molniya orbits require considerably less launch energy than those in geostationary orbits (especially launching from high latitudes), their ground stations need steerable antennas to track the spacecraft, links must be switched between satellites in a constellation and range changes cause variations in signal amplitude. Additionally, there is a greater need for station-keeping, and the spacecraft will pass through the Van Allen radiation belt four times per day.

===Southern hemisphere proposals===
Similar orbits with an argument of perigee of 90¬∞ could allow high-latitude coverage in the southern hemisphere. A proposed constellation, the &quot;Antarctic Broadband Program&quot;, would have used satellites in an inverted Molniya orbit to provide broadband internet service to facilities in Antarctica. Initially funded by the now defunct Australian Space Research Programme, it did not progress beyond initial development.

===Molniya constellations===
Permanent high-latitude coverage of a large area of Earth (like the whole of Russia, where the southern parts are about 45¬∞N) requires a constellation of at least three spacecraft in Molniya orbits. If three spacecraft are used, then each spacecraft will be active for a period of eight hours per orbit, centered around apogee, as illustrated in figure 4. Figure 5 shows the satellite&#x27;s field of view around the apogee. 

The Earth completes half a rotation in twelve hours, so the apogees of successive Molniya orbits will alternate between one half of the northern hemisphere and the other. For the original Molniya orbit, the apogees were placed over Russia and North America, but by changing the right ascension of the ascending node this can be varied. The coverage from a satellite in a Molniya orbit over Russia is shown in figures 6 to 8, and over North America in figures 9 to 11.

The orbits of the three spacecraft should then have the same orbital parameters, but different right ascensions of the ascending nodes, with their passes over the apogees separated by 7.97 hours. Since each satellite has an operational period of approximately eight hours, when one spacecraft travels four hours after its apogee passage (see figure 8 or figure 11), then the next satellite will enter its operational period, with the view of the earth shown in figure 6 (or figure 9), and the switch-over can take place. Note that the two spacecraft at the time of switch-over are separated by about , so that the ground stations only have to move their antennas a few degrees to acquire the new spacecraft.

===Diagrams===


==Properties==
A typical Molniya orbit has the following properties:

* Argument of perigee: 270¬∞
* Inclination: 63.4¬∞
* Period: 718 minutes
* Eccentricity: 0.74
* Semi-major axis: 

===Argument of perigee===
The argument of perigee is set at 270¬∞, causing the satellite to experience apogee at the most northerly point of its orbit. For any future applications over the southern hemisphere, it would instead be set at 90¬∞.

===Orbital inclination===
In general, the oblateness of the Earth perturbs the argument of perigee (formula_1), so that it gradually changes with time. If we only consider the first-order coefficient formula_2, the perigee will change according to equation , unless it is constantly corrected with station-keeping thruster burns.

{(1-e^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_3 is the orbital inclination, formula_4 is the eccentricity, formula_5 is mean motion in degrees per day, formula_2 is the perturbing factor, formula_7 is the radius of the earth, formula_8 is the semimajor axis, and formula_9 is in degrees per day.

To avoid this expenditure of fuel, the Molniya orbit uses an inclination of 63.4¬∞, for which the factor formula_10 is zero, so that there is no change in the position of perigee over time. An orbit designed in this manner is called a frozen orbit.

===Orbital period===
To ensure the geometry relative to the ground stations repeats every 24 hours, the period should be about half a sidereal day, keeping the longitudes of the apogees constant.

However, the oblateness of the Earth also perturbs the right ascension of the ascending node (formula_11), changing the nodal period and causing the ground track to drift over time at the rate shown in equation .

 {(1-e^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt; |}}

where formula_12 is in degrees per day.

Since the inclination of a Molniya orbit is fixed (as above), this perturbation is formula_13 degrees per day. To compensate, the orbital period is adjusted so that the longitude of the apogee changes enough to cancel out this effect.

===Eccentricity===
The eccentricity of the orbit is based on the differences in altitudes of its apogee and perigee. To maximise the amount of time that the satellite spends over the apogee, the eccentricity should be set as high as possible. However, the perigee needs to be high enough to keep the satellite substantially above the atmosphere to minimize drag (~600km), and the orbital period needs to be kept to approximately half a sidereal day (as above). These two factors constrain the eccentricity, which becomes approximately 0.737.

===Semi-major axis===
The exact height of a satellite in a Molniya orbit varies between missions, but a typical orbit will have a perigee altitude of approximately and an apogee altitude of , for a semi-major axis of .

==Modelling==
To track satellites using Molniya orbits, scientists use the SDP4 simplified perturbations model, which calculates the location of a satellite based on orbital shape, drag, radiation, gravitation effects from the sun and moon, and earth resonance terms.

<text>The UEFA Intertoto Cup (from , &quot;between&quot; and , &quot;betting pool&quot;), originally called the International Football Cup, was a summer football competition between European clubs. The competition was discontinued after the 2008 tournament.

The tournament was founded in 1961‚Äì62, but was only taken over by UEFA in 1995. Initially, the tournament ended with a single champion, who received the Intertoto Cup. Starting in 1967, the tournament ended with a number of group winners (7 to 14 winners, see below), who received cash prizes. When UEFA took on the tournament, it became a qualifier for the UEFA Cup, with 2 to 11 Intertoto winners (see below) advancing to the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup.

Any club who wished to participate had to apply for entry, with the highest placed clubs (by league position in their domestic league) at the end of the season entering the competition. The club did not have to be ranked directly below the clubs which had qualified for another UEFA competition; if the club which was in that position did not apply, they would not be eligible to compete, with the place instead going to the club which did apply.

The cup billed itself as providing both an opportunity for clubs who otherwise would not get the chance to enter the UEFA Cup and as an opportunity for sports lotteries (or pools) to continue during the summer. 
This reflects its background, which was as a tournament solely for football pools. In 1995, the tournament came under official UEFA sanctioning and UEFA Cup qualification places were granted. Initially, two were provided; this was increased to three after one year; but in 2006, it was again increased to the final total of 11.

==History==
The Intertoto Cup was the idea of Malm√∂ FF chairman Eric Persson and the later FIFA vice-president and founder of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Ernst B. Thommen, and the Austrian coach Karl Rappan, who coached the Switzerland national team at the 1938 FIFA World Cup and at the 1954 World Cup. The &quot;Cup for the Cupless&quot; was also heavily promoted by the Swiss newspaper &quot;Sport&quot;. It derived its name from &quot;Toto&quot;, the German term for football pools.

Thommen, who had set up football betting pools in Switzerland in 1932, had a major interest in having purposeful matches played in the summer break. UEFA were initially disinclined to support the tournament, finding its betting background distasteful; nevertheless they permitted the new tournament but refrained from getting officially involved. Clubs which qualified for one of the official continental competitions, such as the European Champions Cups and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, were not allowed to participate.

The first tournament was held in 1961 as the International Football Cup (IFC). Initially the Cup had a group stage, which led to knock-out matches culminating in a final. By 1967, it had become difficult to organize the games, and so the knock-out rounds and the final were scrapped, leaving the tournament without a single winner. Instead, group winners received prizes of CHF10,000-15,000.

By 1995, UEFA had reconsidered their opinion, took official control of the tournament and changed its format. Initially, two winners were given a place in the UEFA Cup. The success of one of the first winners, Bordeaux, in reaching the final of the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Cup encouraged UEFA to add a third UEFA Cup place in 1996.

Many clubs disliked the competition and saw it as disruptive in the preparation for the new season. As a consequence, they did not nominate themselves for participation even if entitled. In particular, following its 1995 relaunch, clubs in England were sceptical about the competition; after initially being offered three places in the cup, all English top division teams rejected the chance to take part. Following the threat of bans of English teams from all UEFA competitions, three English clubs were entered but fielded weakened teams. 
UEFA&#x27;s punishment was to dock England a fourth UEFA Cup qualification place in 1995‚Äì96 &quot;due to the conduct of Tottenham and Wimbledon in last season&#x27;s Intertoto Cup.&quot;

In following years, UEFA made it possible for nations to forfeit Intertoto places. For example, in 1998, Scotland, San Marino and Moldova forfeited their places, and England, Portugal, and Greece forfeited one of their two, Crystal Palace being the sole English entrant despite finishing bottom of the Premier League. Other clubs have built upon their success in the UI Cup, following it up with great campaigns in the UEFA Cup. Furthermore, UEFA rejected this assertion that the tournament is disruptive. They point out that in the 2004‚Äì05 season, two of the three 2004 Intertoto Cup winners went on to qualify directly for the Champions League (Schalke and Lille) whilst the 3rd one qualified by winning its 3rd qualifying round (Villarreal).

In December 2007, following the election of new UEFA president Michel Platini, it was announced that the Intertoto Cup would be abolished as of 2009. This was a part of a range of changes that were to be made to the UEFA Cup/Champions League System. Instead of teams qualifying for the Intertoto Cup, they would now qualify directly for the qualifying stages of the UEFA Europa League, which was expanded to four rounds to accommodate them. The UEFA Europa Conference League was introduced in 2021 as a third-tier European tournament.

==Format==
When the competition was taken over by UEFA in 1995, the format was both a group stage and a knock-out stage; 60 teams were split into 12 groups of five with the 16 best teams then contesting the knock-out stage with two-legged ties at each stage, the two winning finalists qualifying for the UEFA Cup. In 1996 and 1997, just the 12 group winners entered the knock-out round, with now three finalists advancing. Nations were allocated places according to their UEFA coefficients, much as with other UEFA tournaments.

The group stage was scrapped for the 1998 tournament, which became a straight knock-out tournament, with clubs from more successful nations entering at a later stage. This arrangement lasted until 2005.

From the 2006 tournament, the format for the Cup changed. There were three rounds instead of the previous five, and the 11 winning teams from the third round went through to the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup. The clubs which were furthest in the UEFA Cup would each be awarded with a trophy. The first club that received that trophy (a plaque) was Newcastle United.

Only one team from each national association was allowed to enter. However, if one or more nations did not take up their place, the possibility was left open for nations to have a second entrant. Seedings and entry were determined by each association. Teams from the weakest federations entered at the first round stage, while those from mid-level federations entered in the second round, and those from the strongest federations entered in the third round.

<doc id="616362" wikidata="Q3358102" url="?curid=616362" title="West Texas">
<text>West Texas is a loosely defined region in the U.S. state of Texas, generally encompassing the arid and semiarid lands west of a line drawn between the cities of Wichita Falls, Abilene, and Del Rio.

No consensus exists on the boundary between East Texas and West Texas. While most Texans understand these terms, no boundaries are officially recognized and any two people are likely to describe the boundaries of these regions differently. The historian and geographer Walter Prescott Webb has suggested that the 98th meridian separates East and West Texas; writer A.C. Greene proposed that West Texas extends west of the Brazos River. Use of a single line, though, seems to preclude the use of other separators, such as an area‚ÄîCentral Texas. Texas is part of the South and the American Southwest at the same time, while the semiarid and desert climates of West Texas are clearly characteristic of the Southwest.

West Texas is often subdivided according to distinct physiographic features. The portion of West Texas that lies west of the Pecos River is often called &quot;Far West Texas&quot; or the &quot;Trans-Pecos&quot;, a term introduced in 1887 by geologist Robert T. Hill. The Trans-Pecos lies within the Chihuahuan Desert and is the aridest part of the state. Another part of West Texas is the Llano Estacado, a vast region of high, level plains extending into Eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. East of the Llano Estacado lies the &quot;redbed country&quot; of the Rolling Plains, and south of the Llano Estacado lies the Edwards Plateau. The Rolling Plains and Edwards Plateau subregions act as transitional zones between eastern and western Texas.

==Climate==
West Texas receives much less rainfall than the rest of Texas and has an arid or semiarid climate, requiring most of its scant agriculture to depend heavily on irrigation. Northern portions of the area are irrigated with water from underground sources, such as the Ogallala Aquifer. Irrigation withdrawal, and water taken out farther north for the needs of El Paso and Juarez, Mexico, have reduced the Rio Grande to a stream in some places, even dry at times. 

Parts of West Texas have rugged terrain, including many small mountain ranges, while most parts of the state are closer to sea level. The northern parts of West Texas and the higher elevations of the mountain ranges of the Trans-Pecos region are prone to occasional heavy snowfall during winter, whereas snow is less common in other areas of West Texas.

==Counties==
The 72 counties of West Texas are Andrews, Bailey, Borden, Brewster, Brown, Callahan, Castro, Cochran, Coke, Coleman, Comanche, Concho, Crane, Crockett, Crosby, Culberson, Dawson, Deaf Smith, Dickens, Eastland, Ector, El Paso, Fisher, Floyd, Gaines, Garza, Glasscock, Hale, Haskell, Hockley, Howard, Hudspeth, Irion, Jeff Davis, Jones, Kent, Kimble, King, Knox, Lamb, Loving, Lubbock, Lynn, Martin, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Midland, Mitchell, Motley, Nolan, Pecos, Presidio, Reagan, Reeves, Runnels, Schleicher, Scurry, Shackelford, Stephens, Sterling, Stonewall, Sutton, Taylor, Terrell, Terry, Throckmorton, Tom Green, Upton, Ward, Winkler, and Yoakum.

==Major cities==

Smaller West Texas cities and towns include Alpine, Andrews, Anthony, Brownfield, Canutillo, Coyanosa, Crane, Fabens, Fort Davis, Fort Stockton, Hale Center, Horizon City, Iraan, Kermit, Lamesa, Levelland, Littlefield, Marathon, Marfa, McCamey, Mertzon, Monahans, Ozona, Pecos, Post, Rankin, Ransom Canyon, San Elizario, Seminole, Slaton, Snyder, Sweetwater, and Van Horn.

==Economy==
Major industries include livestock, petroleum and natural gas production, textiles such as cotton, grain, and because of very large military installations such as Fort Bliss, the defense industry. West Texas has become notable for its numerous wind turbines producing clean and alternative electricity.

As of 2018, the West Texan economy was in a prosperous economic period, which has been described as the &quot;West Texas oil boom&quot;.

==Sports==
While there are no major league teams in the West Texas region, sports fans are faithful to their local high school and college teams. NCAA Division I college teams include the Texas Tech Red Raiders, and the UTEP Miners. NCAA Division II teams include the West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes, the Texas‚ÄìPermian Basin Falcons, and the Lubbock Christian Chaparrals and Lady Chaps.

El Paso hosts the El Paso Chihuahuas, a AAA baseball team, and the El Paso Locomotive FC which plays in the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Midland RockHounds and Amarillo Sod Poodles represent the region in double-A baseball. Junior hockey is also present in the region, with the Odessa Jackalopes of the Tier II North American Hockey League.

==Politics==

Except for the Trans-Pecos region, West Texas has become well known as a stronghold for conservative politics. Some of the most heavily Republican counties in the United States are in the region. Former U.S. President George W. Bush spent most of his childhood in West Texas.

The region includes much of the Permian Basin, the highest producing oil field in the United States. This likely inclines the region to support the Republican Party over the Democratic Party, as the latter supports environmentalism and action on climate change.

Several counties in the Midland-Odessa area were some of the first parts of Texas to abandon the state&#x27;s &quot;Solid South&quot; Democratic roots; two counties have not supported a Democrat for president since 1948. The Rolling Plains to the east remained Democratic substantially longer: although Walter Mondale&#x27;s 1984 campaign lost Texas by 27.50%, he won three counties in this region. Since 2000, this region swung very rapidly toward the Republican Party due to its population&#x27;s intransigent opposition to the liberal social policies of the Democratic Party, and by 2016, it had nearly the same Cook PVI as the Panhandle.

==West of the Pecos in popular culture==

&quot;West of the Pecos&quot; has become a metaphor for the universe of Westerns. &quot;Fastest draw west of the Pecos&quot; and similar superlatives are a cliche, and the title character of &quot;Chisum&quot; observed &quot;There‚Äôs no law west of Dodge, and no God west of the Pecos‚Äù.

Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation take place in West Texas, and much of the movie was filmed there.

<text>Mass marketing is a marketing strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and appeal to the whole market with one offer or one strategy, which supports the idea of broadcasting a message that will reach the largest number of people possible. Traditionally, mass marketing has focused on radio, television and newspapers as the media used to reach this broad audience. By reaching the largest audience possible, exposure to the product is maximized, and in theory this would directly correlate with a larger number of sales or buys into the product.

Mass marketing is the opposite of niche marketing, as it focuses on high sales and low prices and aims to provide products and services that will appeal to the whole market. Niche marketing targets a very specific segment of market; for example, specialized services or goods with few or no competitors.

== Background ==
Mass marketing or undifferentiated marketing has its origins in the 1920s with the inception of mass radio use. This gave corporations an opportunity to appeal to a wide variety of potential customers. Due to this, variety marketing had to be changed in order to persuade a wide audience with different needs into buying the same thing. It has developed over the years into a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry. Although sagging in the Great Depression it regained popularity and continued to expand through the 40s and 50s. It slowed during the anti-capitalist movements of the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s before coming back stronger than before in the 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s and today. These trends are due to corresponding upswings in mass media, the parent of mass marketing. For most of the twentieth century, major consumer-products companies held fast to mass marketing- mass-producing, mass distributing and mass promoting about the same product in about the same way to all consumers. Mass marketing creates the largest potential market, which leads to lowered costs. It is also called overall marketing.

Over the years marketing activities have notably transitioned from traditional forms, such as television, radio and print advertisements to a more digitalized forms, such as the utilisation of online media platforms to reach various consumers. Huang (2009, as cited in Shyu et al., 2015), explains three chief attributes digital marketing has enhanced; one being ‚ÄúPenetrating Power‚Äù which is to have the ability to reach a wider circle of customers in the market, accredited to the ease of online communication. Digital marketing allows for a marketer to reach a larger-scale audience in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, which is ultimately what Mass Marketing seeks to do.

== Persuasion ==
For a mass marketing campaign to be successful, the advertisement must appeal to a ‚Äúset of product needs that are common to most consumers in a target market.‚Äù (Bennett &amp; Strydom, 2001) In this case it is unnecessary to segment consumers into separate niches as, in theory, the product should appeal to any customer&#x27;s wants and/or needs. Many mass marketing campaigns have been successful through persuading audiences using the central route to persuasion, as well as using the peripheral route to persuasion, according to the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Lane et al. state that the different types of persuasion depend on the ‚Äúinvolvement, issue-relevant thinking, or elaboration that a person dedicates to a persuasive message.‚Äù (2013). Political campaigns are a prime example of central persuasion through mass marketing; where the content of the communication involves a detailed level of thinking which seeks to achieve a cognitive response. Contrastingly, a toothpaste advertisement would typically persuade the audience peripherally; where there is low involvement and consumers rely on ‚Äúheuristics‚Äù to alter their behaviour. John Watson was a leading psychologist in mass marketing with his experiments in advertising.

== Strategies ==
=== Shotgun approach ===
The shotgun theory is an approach of mass marketing. It involves reaching as many people as possible through television, cable and radio. On the Web, it refers to a lot of advertising done through banners to text ads in as many websites as possible, in order to get enough eyeballs that will hopefully turn into sales. An example of shotgun marketing would be to simply place an ad on primetime television, without focusing on any specific group of audience. A shotgun approach increases the odds of hitting a target when it is more difficult to focus on one.

A potential limitation of using the shotgun approach is that each receiver will interpret the message in their own way, whether this be the way the sender intends for it to be decoded, or not. In other words, the receiver&#x27;s &quot;frame of reference‚Äù at the time of decoding enables them to perceive a brand message in a particular way; thus, the marketer&#x27;s intention may become distorted. Dahlen, Lange, &amp; Smith (2010) claim that each receiver has different ‚Äúattitudes, values and perceptions stemming from knowledge, experience or the influence of other people.&quot; In situations where there is no specific target market, mass marketers should simply focus on grabbing the attention of consumers in &quot;different, surprising, original and entertaining&quot; ways in order to generate the most desirable feedback. (Bigat, 2012).

=== Guerrilla marketing ===
Guerrilla marketing aims to cut through clutter by attracting attention in unique, memorable and imaginative ways to ‚Äúmaximise interest in a firm&#x27;s goods and services while minimizing the costs of advertising.‚Äù (Bigat, 2012). According to Kotler (2007, as cited in Bigat, 2012) this type of marketing was traditionally carried out by small to medium-sized enterprises but has become more predominant in today&#x27;s society where competition is substantially thicker. It is particularly effective at reaching a large-scale audience due to the captivating nature of the advertisement.

Bigat discusses the role of technology, more specifically, of the internet and its effectiveness of disseminating a large message from the sender to receivers; to which he states that ‚ÄúInternet blogs, online magazines, newspapers along with chat and forum pages are crucial arenas for getting the message across.‚Äù Logically, this is due to the fact that digitalised media generates more efficient feedback from consumers. Mass marketers should aim to effect the behaviour of their consumers by having them engage with the brand in a positive way, which, in turn tends to more activity (both on and offline) as well as further market penetration.

== Use and products sold ==
Mass marketing is used to effect attitude change to as wide an audience as possible. Often this would take the form of selling a product like toothpaste. Toothpaste isn&#x27;t made specially for one consumer and it is sold in huge quantities. A company or individual who manufactures toothpaste wishes to get more people to buy their particular brand over another. The goal is when a consumer has the option to select a tube of toothpaste that the consumer would remember the product which was marketed. Mass marketing is the opposite of niche marketing, where a product is made specially for one person or a group of persons. Other products of mass marketing are furniture, artwork, automobiles, residential communities, fizzy drinks and personal computers. Typically, things which are perceived to be necessary/essential to the consumer are subject to mass marketing. Resources of mass marketing provide cost-effective marketing solutions for small and micro businesses, including start-ups. Even &quot;products&quot; like politicians and services from professions such as law, chiropractic and medicine, are subject to mass marketing.

== Questions of quality ==
To further increase profits, mass marketed products touted as &quot;durable goods&quot; are often made of substandard material, so that they deteriorate prematurely. This practice is called planned obsolescence. Not only does this lower production costs, but it ensures future sales opportunities by preventing the market from becoming saturated with high-quality, long-lasting goods. The forces of a free market tend to preclude the sale of substandard staples, while disposability, technological innovations, and a culture of collection all facilitate planned obsolescence.

Many mass marketed items are considered staples. These are items people are accustomed to buying new when their old ones wear out (or are used up). Cheaper versions of durable goods are often marketed as staples with the understanding that they will wear out sooner than more expensive goods, but they are so cheap that the cost of regular replacement is easily affordable.

==Benefits==
Since the target audience is broad, the number of successful hits is high despite the low probability of a single person turning up, and if all the efforts in one particular area goes in vain, the eventual loss is less compared to one in a narrowly focused area. Production costs per unit are low on account of having one production run for homogeneous product, and marketing research/advertising costs are also relatively low as well, which, as a whole, leads to higher potentials of sales volume and efficiency of scale in a much larger market.

== Drawbacks ==
Due to increased competition and the complexity of consumers‚Äô wants and needs in today&#x27;s society, Bennett and Strydom (2001) suggest that mass marketing campaigns are less likely to be successful; as consumers have a range of specific tastes and requirements that they would more likely find in alternative products.

== Psychological impact ==
Mass marketing has been criticized for the psychological impact on viewers, as critics believe that it makes the reader more vulnerable to issues such as eating disorders. In a 2006 article by Sharlene Hesse-Biber et al. for the &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies International Forum&quot;, they state that the &quot;food, diet, and fitness industries, aided by the media, espouse the message that independence for women in general, means self-improvement, self-control, and that it is the women&#x27;s responsibility to achieve the ultra-slender body ideal‚Äù.

Critics also note that marketers have people fill out surveys with specific questions that allow them to have the information they need to best target and persuade their potential customers, which can manipulate them into believing that they need or want the product being marketed. Historically, mass marketing has been used to popularize products such as mouthwash and cigarettes via advertisements and slogans, in order to reach markets that may have previously not assumed that the product was necessary for their daily lives.

<text>Cephalic Carnage is an American death metal band formed in Denver, Colorado in 1992. The band comprises vocalist Leonard Leal, guitarists Steve Goldberg and Brian Hopp, drummer John Merryman and bassist Nick Schendzielos. Cephalic Carnage has released six studio albums and toured in North America, Europe and Japan.

Cephalic Carnage play a technically proficient deathgrind style, progressively experiment with other genres, and incorporate songs of joke nature into their albums, such as parodies of black metal or metalcore. They refer themselves as &quot;rocky mountain hydro grind&quot;.

== History ==

=== &quot;Conforming to Abnormality&quot; and &quot;Exploiting Dysfunction&quot; (1992‚Äì2001) ===

Cephalic Carnage formed in Denver, Colorado, in 1992 by vocalist Leonard Leal, drummer Anthony Chavez, bassist Tom Clenin, and guitarist Zac Joe. The quartet recorded a demo EP titled &quot;Scrape My Lungs&quot; in 1993, but then took a break until 1996, when they recruited drummer John Merryman, guitarist Steve Goldberg and bassist Doug Williams. Merryman also collaborated with Secret Chiefs 3. Soon after the reformation, their second demo EP &quot;Fortuitous Oddity&quot; was released. During 1997, Cephalic Carnage financed its own tour across the United States.

In 1998, the band caught the attention of Italian record label Headfucker Records, which released the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Conforming to Abnormality&quot; that year. Williams left in 1999 and joined Origin. He was replaced by Jawsh Mullen, and the band toured at the Milwaukee Metalfest in 1998, the Dallas Grindfest, the Ohio Deathfest and the Denver Hatefest in 1999.

In 2000, Cephalic Carnage signed to heavy metal record label Relapse Records and released its second album &quot;Exploiting Dysfunction&quot;, which included a tour with Napalm Death and The Dillinger Escape Plan.

=== &quot;Lucid Interval&quot; and &quot;Anomalies&quot; (2002‚Äì2006) ===

&quot;Lucid Interval&quot;, the band&#x27;s third album, was recorded in early 2002 and released in August that year. The band toured a month later in Canada and subsequently in the U.S. with German thrash metal veterans Kreator and Destruction. In May 2003, the band undertook the &quot;North American Contamination&quot; tour alongside Mastodon and others. That September, Cephalic Carnage and Madball supported Hatebreed on the North American &quot;Rise of Brutality&quot; tour.

In September 2004, the band recorded its next album, &quot;Anomalies&quot;, with producer Dave Otero. Darren Doane directed a promotional music video for &quot;Dying Will Be the Death of Me&quot;, which premiered at MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The song parodies American metalcore with its music, lyrics and vocals. In March 2005, &quot;Anomalies&quot; was released, and the band toured in North America once again.

Mullen exited in January 2006 to prioritize his education and other acts, and the band soon found replacement Nick Schendzielos. In March, the band&#x27;s recording studio was robbed. They played several shows in the United States in April, and an extensive European tour followed in June with Darkest Hour.

=== &quot;Xenosapien&quot; (2007‚Äì2009) ===

The band recorded its next studio album between November and December 2006, and its release was set for May 2007 under the title &quot;Xenosapien&quot;. In March 2007, the band supported Brujeria on U.S. dates and subsequently embarked on &quot;Xenosapien World Tour&quot;, which started in continental Europe on May 4, continued in United Kingdom and Ireland in May and resumed in the &quot;Summer Slaughter&quot; trek (dubbed the &quot;Summer&#x27;s Laughter&quot; by band members) across the U.S. throughout June and July along with Decapitated among others. The band also filmed a music video for the song &quot;Endless Cycle of Violence&quot;. On November 20, 2007, the band&#x27;s van was robbed. Their &quot;recent earnings from the tour (close to $4,000), a laptop with more than $2,000 in music-software programs loaded, an iPod and various personal items&quot; were stolen.

Cephalic Carnage reissued &quot;Conforming to Abnormality&quot; under Relapse Records on April 29, 2008. They participated in a &quot;mini-tour&quot; of Japan in May 2009, performing in Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo. In June 2009, Cephalic Carnage, along with Cattle Decapitation and Withered, pulled out of the Blackenedfest tour due to organization problems and said they were &quot;getting on with writing the next full length, (...) as well as finishing construction of our late night poutine stand, where we will serve country-fried giraffe eggs and your favorite French-Canadian specialty.&quot; In October 2009, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Vaporized&quot; while writing a new album and announced a planned concert DVD entitled &quot;Live at Your Mom&#x27;s House&quot;.

=== &quot;Misled by Certainty&quot; (2010‚Äìpresent) ===

Cephalic Carnage began recording their new album, &quot;Misled by Certainty&quot;, in May 2010. It was released August 31, 2010 by Relapse Records. They also reissued &quot;Lucid Interval&quot; on September 13, 2011.

== Musical style ==

AllMusic describes the style of Cephalic Carnage as &quot;crazy concoction of truly experimental grindcore, death metal, and jazz&quot;. Their music varies from deathgrind, technical death metal, occasional surf rock, instrumental, to flamenco interludes or violin-and-sax ambient jams. Their early style is typically progressive and technically proficient, with some comedic songs. Their later work developed into a more experimental, complex direction.

Cephalic Carnage is also known for its humorous songs. Popmatters points out some examples: &quot;On past albums, the band has taken satirical swipes at the overtly image-oriented black metal (&quot;Black Metal Sabbath&quot;) and the oversaturated, angst-ridden metalcore sound (&quot;Dying Will Be the Death of Me&quot;), and even in live settings, they&#x27;re not above taking the odd spontaneous piss-take to bring some levity to a situation. One notorious YouTube clip has a fight starting in the pit at a Cephalic show in Toronto, and in an inspired moment, the band launches into a rousing excerpt from &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, to a raucous ovation from the kids.&quot;

<text>Waiouru is a small town in the Ruapehu District, in New Zealand&#x27;s Manawat≈´-Whanganui region. It is located on the south-eastern North Island Volcanic Plateau, north of Palmerston North and 25 kilometres south-east of Mount Ruapehu. The town had a population of 765 in the 2018 census.

The main attraction of Waiouru is the National Army Museum, opened in 1978, which features static displays of New Zealand&#x27;s military heritage. The rest of the township consists of a small cluster of a police station, two garages, a petrol station/postal agency, a panel beater, two motels, a tavern and half a dozen cafe/restaurants spread along the highway. There are three unmanned diesel refueling sites for the 700+ big freight trucks that pass through Waiouru each day. Nearby are the yards of a roading contractor and a maintenance contractor. A grocery store, hairdresser and beautician are in the Army housing area two kilometres away, and a medical centre, public library, cafe and department store are inside the army camp.

Waiouru is a military town that has grown up in conjunction with the New Zealand Army Camp and the Training Group (ATG), which is responsible for the training of recruits and other soldiers. The Desert Road immediately north of Waiouru runs through the 870¬†km2 army training area, which lies mainly to the east of the road. The Royal NZ Navy&#x27;s Irirangi communications station with its huge antennae is 2¬†km north of Waiouru.

North of Waiouru is the section of State Highway 1 called the &quot;Desert Road&quot;. This runs for 50¬†km through the Rangipo Desert to T≈´rangi, at the southern end of Lake Taup≈ç. Waiouru is on the North Island Main Trunk railway, which came through in 1907. Waiouru Railway Station is the highest station (814 m) on the New Zealand rail system. The Northern Explorer does not stop at Waiouru, but its predecessor the Overlander did until April 2005.

Seven kilometres to the west of Waiouru is the small settlement of Tangiwai, the site of New Zealand&#x27;s worst railway disaster. On 24 December 1953 the overnight express from Wellington to Auckland passed over Tangiwai railway bridge just after it had been weakened by a lahar from Mount Ruapehu. The bridge collapsed, sending the train into the Whangaehu River, killing 151 people. Many army and naval personnel were involved in the rescue of survivors and the recovery of bodies. Sister Mortimer of the Waiouru Camp Hospital, &quot;The Angel of Tangiwai&quot;, worked non-stop for three days tending the survivors and laying out the bodies.

==History==

Merino sheep were brought from Taup≈ç in 1855 by missionary Tom Grace, to graze on the tussock lands in the Waiouru area. The flock was eaten by Te Kooti&#x27;s warriors in 1869, and 4000 more merinos were brought over the mountains from Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

In England, the development of steam-powered machinery for making woolen cloth caused the price paid for raw wool to rise to ¬£150 per ton, (about NZ$60 a kilo at today&#x27;s values). And Waiouru sat in the middle of the Murimotu plains, 60,000 hectares of tussock grassland, enough to graze 60,000 sheep, annually producing about 240 tons of wool worth ¬£36,000 (with the buying power of NZ$14 million today)

In 1871 the government sought to lease these tussock plains. It offered the Maori land-owners an annual rent of ¬£3500, worth NZ$1.4 million today. But first, all the land-owning groups had to agree, and this caused great delays, as parts of the Murimotu plains had been used to gather wild-fowl by all the surrounding land-owners, Ngati Rangi (Karioi/Whanganui river) Te Ati Hau/T≈´wharetoa (Taumarunui/Lake Taup≈ç) and Ngati Whiti (Moawhango).

The boundaries had already been sorted out back in 1850 at a huge hui chaired by Wanganui missionary Richard Taylor, with most of the Murimotu land being allotted to various hapu of Ngati Rangi, but no money was at stake back then, and in the intervening 20 years the Hauhau/Titokowaru/Te Kooti wars had been fought, creating new power groups and enmities, especially between the coastal Whanganui guerilla leader Major Kemp/Te Keepa and his upper river rival, Major Topia Turoa, and consequently numerous conflicting claims were put forward.

In 1876, after five years of Land Court hearings at Wanganui, there was still no agreement. By 1877, one hundred and six claimant owners had signed the lease agreement, but the land had not been surveyed, so others still refused to sign.

===Studholme&#x27;s land grab===
While they argued, John Studholme, described by the &quot;Wanganui Herald&quot; as a &quot;Canterbury land shark&quot;, had already been grazing the land around Waiouru for three years. Backed by the Auckland capitalists Moorhouse, Morrin and Russell, he had made a highly illegal deal in 1874, leasing the land for 21 years from Topia Turoa, who claimed ownership of all the land between Rangipo and Karioi through his marriage of Makarena Utaora of Ngati Rangi.
In March 1874, Studholme&#x27;s men had moved cattle and sheep onto the land. They started building houses, stables and sheds at Karioi, and shepherds&#x27; huts at Waiouru.

In January 1880 the Studholme land ring tried to obtain permanent ownership of the land from Topia and sent surveyors to mark the exact boundaries. This incensed the Ngati Rangi faction and they called on Major Kemp for assistance. He re-activated his company of seasoned gun-fighters, with whom he had routed the Hauhau at the Battle of Moutua Island 16 years previously, and they rode up from the Whanganui river valley to Waiouru, and then on another 10¬†km east to the strategic high ground of Auahitotara, where they began some sabre-rattling live-firing practice. This upset the Ngati Whiti people at Moawhango village 15¬†km to the east, who re-activated their own gun-fighters as well. The Moawhango militia moved forward to two shepherds&#x27; huts at Te Waiu and dug gun-fighters&#x27; trenches all round them. These trenches, known as the Waiu Pa site, can still be seen today.

A Maori missionary defused the situation before any bloodshed occurred, and in 1884 the Land Court finally awarded ownership of each block of the now-surveyed Murimotu land to various hapu of Ngati Rangi, although Studholme&#x27;s political connections in Wellington allowed him to keep his lease for its remaining 11 years.

But it was a hollow victory for Studholme; although his costs remained high, the price paid for wool plummeted as vast new sheep farms in Australia came into production. And the extremely cold winter of 1893, with deep snow on the ground from Easter to October, killed 20,000 of his sheep and left the rest emaciated.

By the mid-1890s there were only 40,000 merinos on the tussock lands between Karioi bush and the Kaimanawa Ranges.

===Infrastructure development===
Pack-tracks had been formed in the 1870s, after traces of gold were discovered in 1869, 30¬†km north-east of Waiouru on Mr. Lyon&#x27;s run at Kereru. The &quot;Gentle Annie&quot; track was used to get the hundreds of tons of Murimotu wool to Napier and later the shorter, but muddier, routes of &quot;Hales&#x27; Track&quot; and &quot;Field&#x27;s Track&quot; to Wanganui were built. These tracks were later developed into roads for wool wagons and stage-coaches. By 1897 there was a coaching house at Waiouru for mail-coach passengers on the Napier-Taup≈ç run. 

About 1904, Alfred Peters set up a post office, store and an accommodation house for travelers at Waiouru and for the 500 men who were digging the huge railway cuttings 1¬†km west of Waiouru. (Archer 2009) In 2007, Alfred Peters&#x27; descendants were still farming just east of Waiouru 100 years later.
The North Island Main Trunk railway arrived in 1907, when the Waiouru railway station was opened; the station closed to goods in 1986, and to passengers in 2005 when the Overlander no longer stopped there. 

By 1907 little wool was being sent out, as overgrazing by sheep had led to a plague of rabbits. By the 1930s no sheep at all could be grazed on the Waiouru sheep station. In 1939 most of the leasehold Waiouru sheep station land was taken by the Government for the Army Camp.

Wally Harding began farming and developing the Waiouru sheep station in 1939, cultivating the tussock land with giant discs pulled by a crawler tractor, and then oversowing with swedes. In 1951 he began aerial topdressing his farm with a war-surplus Tiger Moth. (Moss 1956) This project expanded into Wanganui Aero Work Ltd. Wallie&#x27;s grandson Lockie still farms at Waiouru in 2014.

In 1978, the QEII Army Memorial Museum, now named the National Army Museum, was opened. Its buildings were designed by Sir Miles Warren and it was built alongside State Highway 1 by engineers of the New Zealand Army. It has since been expanded with additions constructed in 1983 and 1995.

==Demographics==
Waiouru covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Waiouru had a population of 765 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 24 people (3.2%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 597 people (‚àí43.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 219 households, comprising 438 males and 327 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.34 males per female. The median age was 28.0 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 198 people (25.9%) aged under 15 years, 222 (29.0%) aged 15 to 29, 306 (40.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 39 (5.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 67.8% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 41.2% MƒÅori, 6.3% Pacific peoples, 4.7% Asian, and 3.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 51.4% had no religion, 31.4% were Christian, 5.1% had MƒÅori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.4% were Buddhist and 2.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 81 (14.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 96 (16.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $44,900, compared with $31,800 nationally. 93 people (16.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 423 (74.6%) people were employed full-time, 60 (10.6%) were part-time, and 12 (2.1%) were unemployed.

==Waiouru Military Camp==
From 1936 to 1938, Territorial artillery batteries camped under canvas at Waiouru for their summer training exercises. In 1939, a month after war was declared, most of the leasehold Waiouru run was taken back by the Crown. By December 1940 a large training camp had been built, and 340¬†km2 of land acquired for training.

From 1949 another 250¬†km2 of land to the north and east was acquired for training, and for upgrading of the State Highway and constructing a high-voltage power line up the Moawhango valley. The base expanded for compulsory National Service and for NZSAS training. At its peak in the 1970s, Waiouru had a population of 6000 people, including 600+ school aged children.

In the 1980s, some army units were transferred to Linton, and by 1990 Waiouru&#x27;s permanent population had fallen to about 3000. In 2005, Waiouru&#x27;s population dropped to about 2000 with the transfer out of armoured force personnel, and continues to drop as operations are shifted to nearby Linton Camp and Ohakea. But the Army expects a number of courses to continue to be run at Waiouru.

==Waiouru Airfield==
The Royal New Zealand Air Force uses the sealed Waiouru Airfield (ICAO code NZRU) to the west of the camp for practice landings of C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, and Jameson Field inside the camp for NH-90 and A-109 helicopters.

==HMNZS Irirangi==
This Radio Intercept Station 2¬†km south of Waiouru was run by the Royal New Zealand Navy during WWII as Waiouru W/T Station, and from 1951 as HMNZS Irirangi. (Waters 1956) It has now been replaced as an Intercept Station.

==Climate==
Because of its high altitude and close proximity to Mt Ruapehu, Waiouru&#x27;s climate is cold throughout the year, unlike other North Island centres, and particularly cold when the wind blows from the mountain. The Desert Road is regularly closed in winter owing to heavy snowfalls. Waiouru&#x27;s climate can be described as continental. 

==Education==
Waiouru School, a state full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school, is the sole school in Waiouru. It has students as of 

The nearest secondary school to Waiouru is Ruapehu College, away in Ohakune.

<text>Prince Ali bin Al Hussein (; born 23 December 1975) is the third son of King Hussein of Jordan, and the second child of the king by his third wife, Queen Alia. He is also the half brother of King Abdullah II. He is a member of the Hashemite family, which has ruled Jordan since 1921 and claims to be a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

In September 2015, Prince Ali announced his candidacy in the FIFA presidential election following Sepp Blatter&#x27;s resignation.

==Early life and education==

Prince Ali began his primary education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman. He continued his studies in the United Kingdom, the United States and graduated from Salisbury School in Connecticut in 1993, where he excelled in wrestling.

Prince Ali is fluent in Arabic, English, and Circassian.

In 1998 Prince Ali went on a publicized horseback journey to the Caucasus (Circassia), from Jordan through Syria and Turkey, to raise awareness of the Circassian diaspora worldwide. The trip traced (in reverse) the path of the exodus that brought the Circassians to Jordan.

==Personal life==
He is married to Rym Brahimi, they married on September 7, 2004. She is the daughter of Lakhdar Brahimi, former Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs and senior UN official. She was raised in Great Britain and Algeria and was educated in France and the United States. They live in Amman with their two children Princess Jalila bint Ali and Prince Abdullah bin Ali.

==Career==

In 1999, Prince Ali was asked to serve as commander of King Abdullah II‚Ä≤s Special Security in the Royal Guards. He served in that capacity until 28 January 2008, when the king entrusted Prince Ali with establishing and directing the National Centre for Security and Crisis Management. He is also the chairman of Jordan&#x27;s Royal Film Commission - Jordan.

==Football==

Prince Ali is president of the Jordan Football Association. He is also the founder and president of the West Asian Football Federation, and under his presidency the membership has increased to 13 countries.

Prince Ali announced his candidacy for FIFA President, representing Asia, on 7 October 2010. Ali&#x27;s campaign focused on change, football ideals, and uniting and raising the profile of Asian countries, within FIFA and generally.
Prince Ali won the election for the position of FIFA vice president, representing Asia (25 votes to 20 for his opponent Dr Chung Mong-joon) at the AFC Congress in Doha, Qatar, on 6 January 2011. As FIFA vice president, Prince Ali served as a member of both the FIFA and AFC Executive Committees.

Prince Ali successfully championed the lifting of FIFA&#x27;s ban on the hijab in women&#x27;s football.

Ali was one of a number of FIFA officials to call for the publication of the Garcia Report into allegations of corruption surrounding Russia and Qatar&#x27;s bids for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.

in 2012, Prince Ali set up the Asian Football Development Programme (AFDP), a social enterprise focused on Asia and the Middle East which aimed to unite and transform communities through football, promoting respect and tolerance for others, fostering team spirit and developing talent. 

Its achievements include reaching over 80,000 young people directly through its projects, training over 500 coaches, administrators and referees in refugee camps, schools and clubs; distributing 100,000 footballs to young people&#x27;s programmes and organizations and completing 30 projects across 25 countries.

In October 2018, AFDP Global was launched at the Emirates Stadium in London. AFDP Global&#x27;s mission is to extend this work to all regions of the world.

===FIFA presidential campaigns===
Ali lost the 2015 FIFA Presidency election to Sepp Blatter after resigning before second round voting took place. Blatter secured 60 more votes than Ali in the first round of voting, shy of the two thirds majority required to win in the first round, though with only a simple majority required in subsequent rounds Ali&#x27;s defeat appeared to be inevitable.

However, following Blatter&#x27;s announcement in June 2015 that he would resign from the post of FIFA president amid the ongoing corruption scandal, Ali announced in September 2015 that he would run for FIFA president again in the 2016 special election. Ali finished third in the first round behind Gianni Infantino and Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, polling 27 votes. In the second round, Ali again finished third behind the aforementioned duo, garnering a greatly reduced total of 4 votes.

<doc id="616390" wikidata="Q219572" url="?curid=616390" title="Marie Tussaud">
<text>Anna Maria &quot;Marie&quot; Tussaud (; n√©e Grosholtz; 1 December 1761 ‚Äì 16 April 1850), commonly known as Madame Tussaud, was a French artist known for her wax sculptures and Madame Tussauds, the wax museum she founded in London.

== Biography ==

Marie Tussaud was born on 1 December 1761 in Strasbourg, France. Her father, Joseph Grosholtz, was killed in the Seven Years&#x27; War just two months before Marie was born. When she was six years old, her mother, Anne-Marie Walder, took her to Bern, Switzerland. There the family moved into the home of local doctor Philippe Curtius (1741‚Äì1794), for whom Anne-Marie acted as housekeeper.

Curtius, whom Marie would call her uncle, was skilled in wax modeling. He initially used this talent to illustrate anatomy, but he later used it for portraits. He moved to Paris in 1765 to establish a &quot;Cabinet de Portraits En Cire&quot; (Wax portraiture firm). In that year, he made a waxwork of Louis XV&#x27;s last mistress, Madame du Barry, a casting that is the oldest waxwork currently on display. A year later, Tussaud and her mother joined Curtius in Paris. The first exhibition of Curtius&#x27; waxworks was shown in 1770 and attracted a large crowd. In 1776, the exhibition was moved to the Palais Royal and, in 1782, Curtius opened a second exhibit, the Caverne des Grands Voleurs (Cavern of the Grand Thieves), a precursor to Tussaud&#x27;s Chamber of Horrors, on Boulevard du Temple.

===Early career===
Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling. She showed talent for the technique and began working for him as an artist. In 1777, she created her first wax figure, that of Voltaire. From 1780 until the Revolution in 1789, Tussaud created many of her most famous portraits of celebrities such as those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire. During this period her memoirs claim she became employed to teach votive making to √âlisabeth, the sister of Louis XVI. In her memoirs, she admitted to be privy to private conversations between the princess and her brother and members of his court. She also claimed that members of the royal family were so pleased with her work that she was invited to live at Versailles for nine years, although no contemporary evidence exists to confirm her accounts.

=== French Revolution ===
On 12 July 1789, wax heads of Jacques Necker and the duc d&#x27;Orl√©ans made by Curtius were carried in a protest march two days before the attack on the Bastille.

Tussaud was perceived as a royal sympathiser; in the Reign of Terror she was arrested, along with Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, and her head was shaved in preparation for her execution by guillotine. She said she was released thanks to Collot d&#x27;Herbois&#x27; support for Curtius and his household. Tussaud said she then was employed to make death masks and whole body casts of the revolution&#x27;s famous victims, including Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Princesse de Lamballe, Jean-Paul Marat, and Maximilien Robespierre.

When Curtius died in 1794, he left his collection of wax works to Tussaud. In 1795, she married Fran√ßois Tussaud, a civil engineer. The couple had three children: a daughter who died after birth and two sons, Joseph and Fran√ßois.

=== Great Britain ===

In 1802, after the Treaty of Amiens, Tussaud went to London with her son Joseph, then four years old, to present her collection of portraits. She had accepted an invitation from Paul Philidor, a magic lantern and phantasmagoria pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the Lyceum Theatre. She did not fare particularly well financially, and left for Edinburgh in 1803.
As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Tussaud was unable to return to France so she travelled with her collection throughout the British Isles. In 1822, she reunited with her son Fran√ßois, who joined her in the family business. Her husband remained in France and the two never saw each other again. In November 1825, her touring exhibition was in the Wisbech Georgian theatre (now the Angles Theatre), having already been at Yarmouth, Norwich, King&#x27;s Lynn and Bury St Edmunds. Entrance was 1s. In 1835, after 33 years touring Britain, she established her first permanent exhibition in Baker Street, on the upper floor of the &quot;Baker Street Bazaar&quot;. In 1838, she wrote her memoirs. In 1842, she made a self-portrait which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. Some of the sculptures done by Tussaud herself still exist.

She died in her sleep in London on 16 April 1850 at the age of 88. There is a memorial tablet to Madame Marie Tussaud on the right side of the nave of St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Cadogan Street, London.

== Legacy ==

Upon Marie Tussaud&#x27;s retirement, her son Fran√ßois (or Francis) became chief artist for the Exhibition. He was succeeded by his son Joseph, who was succeeded by his son John Theodore Tussaud.

Madame Tussaud&#x27;s wax museum has now grown to become one of the major tourist attractions in London and has expanded with branches in Amsterdam, Istanbul, Beijing, Bangkok, Berlin, Blackpool, Sydney, Hong Kong, Wuhan, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Chongqing, Shanghai, New York City, Orlando, Nashville, Hollywood, Singapore, Tokyo, Budapest, Vienna, Washington D.C., New Delhi and Dubai. As of 2019, the newest museum is in Prague. The current owner is Merlin Entertainments, a company owned by Blackstone Group.

Marie Tussaud was featured as a minor character and quest giver in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot;, which takes place during the French Revolution.

She is one of the main characters in the book &quot;Faces of the Dead&quot; by Suzanne Weyn. Edward Carey&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Little&quot; is a novelization of her work and life.

<text>The Book of Jasher (also spelled Jashar; ), which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a lost book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book. Numerous forgeries purporting to be rediscovered copies of this lost book have been written. A different interpretation identifies it as a reference to the Pentateuch, specifically the Book of Genesis, an interpretation which is notably favored by the Jewish scholar Rashi in his commentary on the Hebrew Bible (see below his commentary on Joshua).

The title ‚ÄúBook of the Just Man‚Äù is the traditional Greek and Latin translation.

== Biblical references ==
The book is mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible. A possible third reference exists with a variant spelling.

=== In Joshua ===
According to the Book of Joshua, while Joshua was winning a battle against Adonizedek (king of Jerusalem) and his allies, Joshua prayed for the sun and moon to stand still. Joshua 10:13 then states:
The presence of this event in a book of poetry has been interpreted as a poetic description of the prolonged battle.

According to the medieval Jewish scholar Rashi, &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot; in this verse refers to the Pentateuch: Jacob&#x27;s prophecy regarding Joshua&#x27;s ancestor Ephraim‚Äî&quot;His seed will fill the nations&quot;‚Äîwas fulfilled when Joshua&#x27;s victory gave him renown among the various nations who heard of the victory.

=== In Samuel ===
According to the Book of Samuel, when David spoke his lament over the deaths of Saul and Jonathan, he began as follows:
The King James Version of the English Bible includes the words ‚Äúthe use of‚Äù in italics, material which its translator(s) added in order to render the text into what they considered understandable and comfortable English. According to some other translations such as the English Standard Version ‚ÄúThe Bow‚Äù () which David taught is hypothesised as a poetic lament over the deaths of Saul and Jonathan. According to this interpretation, this ‚ÄúBow‚Äù refers to a lament or a tune in the Book of Jashar which that book also says was taught to the Israelites. 

The Septuagint translation renders &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; in both cases as the ‚ÄùBook of the Just‚Äù. It also misses the reference to ‚Äúthe bow‚Äù. It reads:
=== In Kings ===
A possible third reference appears in 1 Kings 8. In the Septuagint (though not in the Hebrew text or most translations), verse 8:53 says that the preceding prayer of Solomon is written ‚Äúin the book of song‚Äù (). The Hebrew version of ‚Äúbook of song‚Äù could be (), which is the same as &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot; with two letters transposed. According to Alexander Rofeh, this suggests that the name &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot; could be related to its function as a hymnal, and the second word might have originally been (, &quot;song&quot;) or (, ‚Äúhe will sing‚Äù).

<text>The Books of Chilam Balam () are handwritten, chiefly 17th and 18th-centuries Maya miscellanies, named after the small Yucatec towns where they were originally kept, and preserving important traditional knowledge in which indigenous Maya and early Spanish traditions have coalesced. They compile knowledge on history, prophecy, religion, ritual, literature, the calendar, astronomy, and medicine. Written in the Yucatec Maya language and using the Latin alphabet, the manuscripts are attributed to a legendary author called Chilam Balam, a &quot;chilam&quot; being a priest who gives prophecies and &quot;balam&quot; a common surname meaning  ºjaguar º. Some of the texts actually contain prophecies about the coming of the Spaniards to Yucat√°n while mentioning a &quot;chilam&quot; Balam as their first author.
Nine Books of Chilam Balam are known, most importantly those from Chumayel, Man√≠, and Tizim√≠n, but more have existed. Both language and content show that parts of the books date back to the time of the Spanish conquest of the Yucatec kingdoms (1527‚Äì1546). In some cases, where the language is particularly terse, the books appear to render hieroglyphic script, and thus to hark back to the pre-conquest period.

==Contents==
Taken together, the Books of Chilam Balam provide an account of the fullness of 18th-century Yucatec-Maya spiritual life. Whereas the medical texts and chronicles are quite matter-of-fact, the riddles and prognostications make abundant use of traditional Mayan metaphors. This holds even more true of the mythological and ritualistic texts, which, cast in abstruse language, plainly belong to esoteric lore. The historical texts derive part of their importance from the fact that they have been cast in the framework of the native Maya calendar, partly adapted to the European calendrical system. Reconstructing Postclassic Yucatec history from these data has proven to be an arduous task. The following is an overview of the sorts of texts‚Äîpartly of Mesoamerican, and partly of Spanish derivation‚Äîfound in the Chilam Balam books.

1. History 
*&quot;Histories&quot;, cast in the mold of the indigenous calendar: migration legends; narratives concerning certain lords of the indigenous kingdoms; and chronicles up to and including the Spanish conquest.
*&quot;Prognostication&quot;, cast in the framework of the succession of &quot;haab&quot;s (years), &quot;tun&quot;s (360-day periods) and &quot;k ºatun&quot;s (20X360-day periods).
*&quot;Prophecy&quot;, ascribed to famous early 16th-century oracular priests.

2. Formularies with metaphors 
*&quot;Collections of riddles&quot;, used for the confirmation of local lords into their offices (the so-called &#x27;language of Zuyua&#x27;).

3. Myth and mysticism
*&quot;Myth&quot;, particularly the destruction and re-creation of the world as connected to the start of k ºatun 11 Ahau.
*&quot;Ritualistic mysticism&quot;, particularly concerning the creation of the twenty named days (&quot;uinal&quot;); the ritual of the &#x27;Four Burners&#x27; (&quot;ahtoc&quot;); and the birth of the maize, or &#x27;divine grace&#x27; (the so-called &#x27;Ritual of the Angels&#x27;).

4. Practical calendars and classifications 
*&quot;Classifications according to the twenty named days&quot; (correlating birds of tiding, plants and trees, human characters, and professional activities).
*&quot;Treatises on astrology, meteorology, and the Catholic liturgical calendar&quot; (the so-called &quot;reportorios de los tiempos&quot;). The astrology is Ptolemaic and includes the European zodiac.
*&quot;Agricultural almanacs&quot;.

5. Medical recipes
*&quot;Herbal medicine&quot;: The Chilam Balam books contain the sort of medical prescriptions that derive from Greek and Arab traditions, rather than the Mayan &#x27;incantation approach&#x27;, as represented by the Ritual of the Bacabs.

6. Spanish traditions
*&quot;Roman Catholic instruction&quot;: feast days of the saints, tracts, and prayers.
*&quot;Spanish romance&quot;, such as the tale of the &#x27;Maiden Theodora&#x27;.

==Scholarship==
Since many texts recur in various books of Chilam Balam, establishing a concordance and studying substitution patterns is fundamental to scholarship. The archaic Yucatec idiom and the allusive, metaphorical nature of many texts present a formidable challenge to translators. The outcome of the translation process is sometimes heavily influenced by external assumptions about the texts&#x27; purpose. As a result of these factors, the quality of existing translations varies greatly.

The Spanish-language synoptic translation of Barrera V√°squez and Rend√≥n (1948) is still useful. To date (2012), complete English translations are available for the following Books of Chilam Balam: 
*Chumayel (authoritative edition: Roys 1933 [1967]; compare with Edmonson 1986)
*Man√≠ (embedded in the P√©rez Codex: Craine and Reindorp 1979, an adaptation of the 1949 Mexican translation of Sol√≠s Alcal√°)
*Tizim√≠n (Edmonson 1982)
*Na (Gubler and Bolles 2000)
*Kaua (Bricker and Miram 2002)
An excellent overview and discussion of the syncretism involved is to be found in the introduction to the Bricker and Miram edition of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua. A detailed analysis and interpretation of the main mythological and ritualistic texts with a view to their syncretic origins is given by Knowlton (2010).

== In popular culture ==
The Books of Chilam Balam are referenced in &quot;The Falling Woman&quot; by Pat Murphy as source material for the description of sacrifices at Chich√©n Itz√°.

A poem from the Chilam Balam is prominently featured in a short story by the U.S.-born writer Lucia Berlin, who spent many years living and traveling in Latin America, including Chile and Mexico. The poem gives Berlin&#x27;s story its title. Here is the poem: &quot;Toda Luna, todo a√±o,/ Todo d√≠a, todo viento/ Camina y pasa tambi√©n./ Tambi√©n toda sangre llega/ Al lugar de su quietud.&quot; The Spanish is a translation from the Mayan by Antonio Mediz Bolio. The story&#x27;s heroine translates the poem as follows: &quot;Every moon, every year/ Every day, every breeze/ Goes along, and passes away./ And thus all blood arrives/ To its own quiet place.&quot;

A brief excerpt from Chilam Balam is used as a prelude to Chapter 3 of the Cuban novel &quot;The Lost Steps&quot; by Alejo Carpentier (1953).

<text>Sefer HaYashar (, the &quot;Book of the Upright&quot;) is a famous treatise on Jewish ritual authored by Rabbeinu Tam (Rabbi Jacob ben Meir, 1100‚Äì1171). The work, which survives in a somewhat incomplete and amended form, was printed in Venice in 1544 and reprinted in Vienna in 1811.

It is especially concerned with reconciling apparently contradictory decisions in different sections of the Talmud and with preserving Talmud text unchanged against those who wanted to make clever emendations.

This &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot; was used a great deal by later Talmudists and introduced the form of literature called &quot;Tosafot&quot; &#x27;Additional Notes&#x27;.

<doc id="616412" wikidata="Q1778697" url="?curid=616412" title="Spearhead from Space">
<text>Spearhead from Space is the first serial of the seventh season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 3 to 24 January 1970. It was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to be produced in colour and the only one to be made entirely on 16 mm film.

In the serial, which is set in Essex and London, the alien time traveller the Doctor (Jon Pertwee), now freshly regenerated and exiled to Earth by the Time Lords, joins Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) of UNIT and the scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John) to stop the incorporeal intelligence the Nestenes from colonising the planet through their use of the Autons, killer plastic automatons which act as human duplicates and shop-window mannequins.

The serial introduced Pertwee as the Doctor and was the first to feature the Autons. It also introduces Caroline John as the Doctor&#x27;s new assistant, Liz. Nicholas Courtney becomes a regular cast member beginning with this serial.

== Plot ==
Forced into exile in 20th Century Earth by the Time Lords, the newly-changed Doctor collapses outside his TARDIS and is taken to Ashbridge Cottage Hospital in Epping, where his unusual alien anatomy confuses the doctors.

Meanwhile, a meteorite shower falls on the English countryside, and a poacher discovers a mysterious plastic polyhedron at the crash site. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT is trying to recruit Dr. Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Shaw as a scientific advisor to examine any meteorites for evidence of aliens. Shaw is sceptical of the Brigadier&#x27;s concerns and resents being taken away from her research at Cambridge.

The plastic polyhedron is a power unit for a non-physical alien intelligence known as the Nestene Consciousness. Normally disembodied, it has an affinity for plastic, and is able to animate human replicas made from it, called Autons. The Nestene have taken over a toy factory in Epping, and plan to replace key government and public figures with Auton duplicates. The Auton in charge of the factory sends other, less human-looking, dummy-like Autons to retrieve the power units from UNIT and the poacher.

After recovering in hospital and avoiding being kidnapped by the Autons, the Doctor discovers that the TARDIS&#x27; takeoff code has been altered by the Time Lords and he is trapped on Earth. Despite his recent change in appearance, he convinces Lethbridge-Stewart that he is the same man who helped to defeat the Yeti and the Cybermen. Together with Liz, he uncovers the Nestene plot, just as the Autons activate across Britain and begin killing. The Doctor assembles an electroshock device that he believes will disable them.

UNIT attacks the plastics factory, but the Autons are impervious to gunfire. The Doctor and Liz make their way inside and encounter a tentacled plastic host created by the Nestenes as the perfect form for the invasion. While the Doctor struggles with the creature, Liz uses the electroshock device to shut the creature down, the effect cascading to all other Autons.

The Brigadier fears the Nestenes will return and asks for the Doctor&#x27;s continued help. The Doctor agrees, albeit reluctantly, to join UNIT. In return, he requires facilities to help repair the TARDIS, and a car like the sporty antique roadster he commandeered during the adventure. At his insistence, Liz also stays on as his assistant.

===Continuity===
The Doctor tells Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart that his name is Doctor John Smith, an alias first used in &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot;.

==Production==

The working title of the serial was &quot;Facsimile&quot;, and was based on a story that Robert Holmes wrote for the 1965 film &quot;Invasion&quot;, which featured an alien crashing in the woods near a rural hospital, where a medical examination reveals his alien nature. The hospital is later visited by other aliens, seeking a fugitive criminal.

Due to industrial action by staff at the BBC Television Centre, this serial was filmed almost entirely on location, in order to circumvent union rules. As a result, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; is the only classic serial shot entirely on film, as was then the standard of location filming. The majority of filming was undertaken at the BBC engineering college at Wood Norton near Evesham, and the pub in nearby Radford.

The change to colour production also necessitated changes to the programme&#x27;s opening titles. Designer Bernard Lodge, who had produced the previous sets of titles used up until &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, originally intended to produce a new set using the same &#x27;howlaround&#x27; technique that he had for the previous titles. Tests showed, however, that the technique did not produce satisfactory results when used with colour equipment and so the final set was produced in black and white before being manually tinted. These were completed in August 1969, a month before work began on the serial.

The new titles also introduced a new logo for the series. Unlike the logos used for the First and Second Doctor&#x27;s eras, which used a generic typeface, the new logo was an attempt at being more stylised, particularly in the presentation of the initial &quot;D&quot; in &quot;Doctor&quot; and the &quot;H&quot; in &quot;Who.&quot; This logo would be used until the final episode of &quot;The Green Death&quot; in 1973, but (in slightly modified form) would make an unexpected return in 1996 when it was adopted as the logo for the US-produced 1996 TV movie. The 1996 form subsequently became the official logo of the Eighth Doctor, and of the franchise itself, being used on original novels, video releases (1996‚Äì2003) including the alternative Ninth Doctor&#x27;s animated &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;, DVD releases, and Big Finish Productions audio plays.

==Broadcast and reception==

The story was repeated in its entirety on Friday evenings on BBC1 in July 1971, achieving ratings of 2.9, 3.0, 3.4 &amp; 3.9 million viewers respectively. It became the first ever broadcast of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; outside of its typical Saturday evening slot. The story was later repeated on BBC2 in 1999.

In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the serial was &quot;arguably the first to really go for the viewer&#x27;s jugular with a potent combination of horror and science-fiction.&quot; They continued, &quot;It is the terrifying and well-realised concept of killer shop dummies that makes &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; one of the most horrific &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories ever [...] Particularly notable is the uncompromising, adult quality of the story&#x27;s realisation, which sets it apart from much of sixties &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and contributes greatly to its success.&quot; Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; five stars out of five, describing it as an &quot;extraordinary debut for the third Doctor&quot; and also a good performance from Courtney; while positive towards John, Mulkern criticised the way Liz was &quot;severely styled.&quot; He also commended the production, particularly Dudley Simpson&#x27;s score. He wrote that &quot;the only real disappointment is the lacklustre representation of the Nestene&quot; and stated that the &quot;boggle-eyed Pertwee&quot; at the end, when he is strangled by the tentacles, &quot;always warrants a snigger&quot;.

Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that the Autons were secondary to the serial&#x27;s main goal of introducing the new cast, but commented that they &quot;provide some effectively chilling moments&quot;. Bahn wrote that the &quot;major flaw&quot; was the pacing, as it spent too much time establishing &quot;the new status quo before getting into the action&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Arnold T. Blumburg rated the DVD special edition release 9 out of 10, describing the serial as &quot;an amazing feat¬†‚Äì a nearly complete top-to-bottom reinvigoration of the show that feels like a full-blown feature film&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;&#x27;s James Peaty called &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; &quot;easily the best &#x27;new Doctor&#x27; story&quot; until Matt Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (2010), and believed that Courtney and John were &quot;so good [...] that you barely miss the Doctor from episode one&quot;.

Reviewing the original DVD release in 2002, DVD Talk&#x27;s J. Doyle Wallis gave the serial three out of five stars, describing it as a &quot;nice exploit&quot; with &quot;pretty neat villains&quot;, but criticising the little the Doctor had to do, despite it being his introduction. Ian Jane of the site was more positive when reviewing the serial for its 2012 re-release, giving it four stars. He praised Pertwee and John, as well as the suspense and pacing. Reviewing the serial for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013, Phelim O&#x27;Neill wrote that &quot;Pertwee impresses, as does his short-lived partnership with apprentice Liz&quot; and added that &quot;the scene of the alien-powered shop display dummies is still chilling.&quot;

In 2013, Ben Lawrence of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; as one of the top ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories set in the contemporary time.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1974, entitled &quot;Doctor Who and the Auton Invasion&quot;. This was the first novelisation commissioned by Target following the successful republishing of three books originally published in the mid-1960s. The Target Books novelisation series would run for the next twenty years and see all but six &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials adapted. In the seventies, this book was translated into Finnish as &quot;Tohtori KUKA ja autonien hy√∂kk√§ys&quot;, although &quot;Doctor Who&quot; never appeared on Finnish television until the broadcast of the 2005 revival series. There were also Dutch, Turkish, Japanese and Portuguese editions.

An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Caroline John was released as four CDs in June 2008 by BBC Audiobooks. The original Target books artwork by Chris Achilleos is featured on the cover.

===Home media===
This serial was released in an omnibus format on VHS in 1988; it was re-released in 1995 as an unedited episodic version, remaining in omnibus format for the United States, Canada, and Australia markets.

The DVD was first released in January 2001, followed by a re-release (with new outer packaging) in July 2007. There was a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD release in May 2011 as part of the &quot;Mannequin Mania&quot; box set, along with &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;; it boasts additional special features and improved remastering. All four episodes have been offered for sale on iTunes.

It was re-released on DVD in 2013 as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 1‚Äì4&quot; box set, together with &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, and &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;. The disc presents the serial as originally broadcast, a single feature in widescreen format, introduced by former show runner Steven Moffat; it includes a documentary on the Third Doctor.

The serial was released on Blu-ray in July 2013. Due to the serial being shot entirely on film, this is the only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story from the classic series where a complete high-definition release (with no upconversion) is feasible. Reviewing this release, Phelim O&#x27;Neill of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film look of &quot;Spearhead From Space&quot;, writing, &quot;It sounds like a small thing but it made an incredible difference; this is the only one of the vintage stories to have the picture quality worthy of a HD transfer. The Blu-ray looks superb, as if they shot a (very) low-budget &quot;Doctor Who&quot; movie late in 1969, which is pretty much what they did. The sets look sturdier, more colourful, and far better than their usual overlit, studio-bound video camerawork&quot;.

In the original broadcast of episode two, the first fifteen seconds of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Oh Well (Part One)&quot; can be heard during scenes in the Auto Plastics factory. This was removed from some video and DVD releases because of copyright issues. It is present on the 1995 VHS release, the 2011 &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD and the 2013 Blu-ray release as the track is now covered by the PPL agreement.

<doc id="616414" wikidata="Q1660954" url="?curid=616414" title="Inchcolm">
<text>Inchcolm (from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Innis Choluim&quot;, meaning Columba&#x27;s Island) is an island in the Firth of Forth in Scotland. The island has a long history as a site of religious worship, having started with a church, which later developed into a monastery and a large Augustine Abbey in the mid 13th century. It was repeatedly attacked by English raiders during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and was later fortified extensively with gun emplacements and other military facilities during both World Wars to defend nearby Edinburgh. 

Inchcolm Abbey and the surrounding island are now in the care of Historic Scotland. The island is accessible to visitors during the day via private boat tours from Queensferry. Many of the religious buildings on Inchcolm remain in fair condition and Inchcolm is described as having the best-preserved cloister in Scotland.

==Geography==

Inchcolm lies in the Firth of Forth off the south coast of Fife opposite Braefoot Bay, east of the Forth Bridge, south of Aberdour, Fife, and north of the City of Edinburgh. It is separated from the Fife mainland by a stretch of water known as Mortimer&#x27;s Deep. The island forms part of the parish of Aberdour, and lies a quarter of a mile from the shore. In the days when people were compelled to cross the Firth of Forth by boat as opposed to bridge, the island was a great deal less isolated, and on the ferry routes between Leith/Lothian and Fife.

The island can be broadly divided into three sections: the east, where its military defensive operations were centred during the Second World War, the lower central part, with the small natural harbour and shop, and a larger western end.

In 2001 there was a resident population of 2 but at the time of the 2011 census there were no &quot;usual residents&quot; recorded.

==History==
===Early history===

Inchcolm was anciently known as Emona, Aemonia or Innis Choluim. It may have been used by the Roman fleet in some capacity, as they had a strong presence at Cramond for a few years, and had to travel to the Antonine Wall.

It was supposedly visited by St Columba (an Irish missionary monk) in 567, and was named after him in the 12th century. As such, the present name Inchcolm means &#x27;Island of Colm&#x27;, with Inch a derogation of innish, Gaelic for Island and Colm believed to be a reference to St Columbia, whose relics were held at Dunkeld Cathedral, originally the head of Inchcolm&#x27;s diocese.

It is believed to have served the monks of the Columban family as an &quot;Iona of the east&quot; from early times. It was first established as a priory in the 1100s. A primitive stone-roofed building survived on the island, preserved and given a vaulted roof by the monks of the later abbey, probably served as a hermit&#x27;s oratory and cell in the 12th century, if not earlier. Fragments of carved stonework from the Dark Ages testify to an early Christian presence on the island. A hogback stone, preserved in the abbey&#x27;s visitor centre, can be dated to the late 10th century, making it probably Scotland&#x27;s earliest type of monument originating among Danish settlers in northern England. A 16th-century source states that a stone cross was situated nearby, although no features could be found which related to the monument. In 1235, the priory was made into an abbey.

The island has a mention in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;:
:That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,
:Craves composition:
:Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,
:Till he disbursed, at &quot;Saint Colmes ynch&quot;,
:Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall use

The reference in Shakespeare arose because Inchcolm was long used as an exclusive burial site (much like Iona). A Danish force under king Sweyn, the father of Canute, raided the island and Fife with an English force. In the play, Macbeth buys off the Danes with a &quot;great summe of gold&quot;, and tells the Danes they could bury their dead there for &quot;ten thousand dollars&quot;. Hector Boece corroborates the claim that the Danes paid good money to have their dead buried there in the 11th century. The practice of burying dead on islands in Scotland is long established ‚Äì and was partly a deterrent to feral dogs and wolves (still found in Scotland at that point) which might dig up the corpses and eat them.

Like other centres of Culdee activity, the island was used as a home for hermits. The nearby Inchmickery&#x27;s name also commemorates a probable hermit. Historical textual evidence suggests that this was the case in the 12th century, when King Alexander I was marooned on the island, and was said to have been looked after by a hermit on the island in 1123. Alexander decided to make the island the site of an Augustinian monastery. 

The earliest known charter is in 1162, when the canons were already well established, and it was raised to the status of an abbey in 1235. Its buildings, including a widely visible square tower, a largely ruined church, cloisters, refectory and small chapter house, are the best preserved of any Scottish medieval monastic house. The ruins are under the care of Historic Scotland (entrance charge; ferry from South Queensferry).

Mortimer&#x27;s Deep, the channel which separates Inchcolm from the mainland, supposedly got its name during this period when some monks of the island who had been tasked with transporting the body of Sir Alan Mortimer to be interred at the church there, instead disposed of his coffin in the sea.

Walter Bower, Abbot 1418‚Äì49, was the author of the Latin &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, one of Scotland&#x27;s most important medieval historical sources. The island was part of the medieval diocese of Dunkeld (also dedicated to St Columba), and several of the medieval bishops were buried within the Abbey church.

===Late Middle Ages and English raids===
Like nearby Inchkeith and the Isle of May, Inchcolm was attacked repeatedly by English raiders in the 14th century. This was the period of the Scottish Wars of Independence, and decisive battles were being fought in the Lothians and in the Stirling/Bannockburn region, and so the island was effectively in the route of any supply or raiding vessels.

In 1335, there was an especially bad raid by an English ship when the abbey&#x27;s treasures were stolen, along with a statue of Columba. The story goes that the ship was nearly wrecked on Inchkeith and had to dock at Kinghorn. The sailors taking a religious turn, thought that this was due to the wrath of Columba, returned the statue and treasures to the island, and experienced good weather on their outward journey.

In 1384, an English raid attempted to set alight Inchcolm Abbey, but this again was foiled by the weather ‚Äì in this case a strong wind blew out the flames. 

In 1441, the Abbot Walter Bower wrote an influential historical study of Scotland called the Scotichronicon.

The island was used as a form of prison in the 14th and 15th centuries. Amongst those interned here were Archbishop Patrick Graham of St Andrews. In 1427, James I confined the mother of Alexander, Lord of the Isles. Mariota, Countess of Ross here.

===Tudor and early modern period===
In the 16th century, the island suffered further English depredation. In 1547, after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, Inchcolm was fortified by the English, like nearby Inchgarvie - while Inchkeith was occupied by their Italian mercenaries for two years. Sir John Luttrell garrisoned the island with 100 hagbutters and 50 labourers on Saturday 17 September 1547. Early in October 1547, the Earl of Angus attempted to recapture the island with five ships. An inventory of 8 January 1548 lists the English armaments on the island as; one culverin; one demi-culverin; 3 iron sakers; a brass saker; 2 iron falcons; 3 brass falcons; 4 fowlers; 2 port pieces; 14 bases; 90 arquebuses, 2 chests of bows; 50 pikes; and 40 bills. The English commander, John Luttrell, abandoned the island and destroyed the fortifications he had made at the end of April 1548.

After the Protestant Scottish reformation of 1560, the island monastic community and abbey was disbanded. However, due to their island location, Inchcolm&#x27;s religious buildings are in better condition than most of those on the mainland as they could not be so easily destroyed by proactive Reformers.

In the 16th century it became the property of Sir James Stewart, whose grandson became third Earl of Moray by virtue of his marriage to the elder daughter of the first earl. From it comes the earl&#x27;s title of Lord St Colme (1611).

In the 1880s, a skeleton was found built into one of the abbey&#x27;s walls. It was standing upright and is of unknown date.

===Military defences===
During both the First World War and the Second World War, Inchcolm was part of the defences of the Firth of Forth. Inchcolm was the HQ of what were called in the First World War the &#x27;Middle defences&#x27;, the main element of which was a continuous anti-submarine and anti-boat boom across the river. The defences were intended to protect the naval anchorage between Inchcolm and the Forth Rail Bridge (as there was no longer room above the bridge to moor all the ships based in the Forth). 

The defences of Inchcolm were significantly strengthened in 1916-17 when it was decided to move the Grand Fleet from Scapa Flow to the Forth. As part of these works 576 Cornwall Works Company, Royal Engineers, built a tunnel under the hill at the east end of the island, to link a new battery of guns to their magazine, on the protected side of the island. The tunnel is dated 1916‚Äì17. At the east end of the island, there were emplacements for two 12-pounder and two twin 6-pounder guns.

The First World War engine house (which powered the defence searchlights) was adapted in the 1930s as a visitor centre, which it is still used by Historic Scotland. The island was re-occupied in 1939, when the anti-submarine and anti-boat boom was once again laid across the estuary. Some the military structures from both the First and Second World Wars survive and remain in situ. These include a First World War drying hut, and the brick building in which the staff of the NAAFI lived in the Second World War. Other surviving buildings include engine rooms, searchlight emplacements, storerooms and officers rooms. The main officers rooms, mess and barrack blocks were cited in the middle and west of the island. Many of the wartime defence structures were deliberately partly demolished in the early 1960s by the engineers of the Territorial Army.

==Tourist attraction==

There are currently two ferry services and one charter yacht company that operate trips to Inchcolm island, and allow passengers 1.5 hours to explore the island. The &quot;Maid of the Forth&quot; and the &quot;Forth Belle&quot; both operate from the Hawes Pier in South Queensferry between Easter and late October.

The main feature of the island is the former Augustinian Inchcolm Abbey (Historic Scotland), Scotland&#x27;s most complete surviving monastic house. In former times, and perhaps partly due to its dedication to Columba, it was sometimes nicknamed &#x27;Iona of the East&#x27;. The well-preserved abbey and ruins of the 9th-century hermit&#x27;s cells attract visitors to the island.

It was the home of a religious community linked with St Colm or St Columba, the 6th-century Abbot of Iona. King Alexander I was storm-bound on the island for three days in 1123 and in recognition of the shelter given to him by the hermits, promised to establish a monastic settlement in honour of St Columba. Though the king died before the promise could be fulfilled, his brother David I later founded a priory here for monks of the Augustinian order; the priory was erected into an abbey in 1223.

==Wildlife==
The west end of the island is home to a large colony of seagulls and fulmars. They nest extensively on the island between April and August.

Seals are commonly spotted around the island and basking on neighbouring outcrops. There are no stoats or hedgehogs on the island; thus, eggs can often be found on the ground.

Between April and July puffins nest on the Northern rockface of the island and can be seen bobbing around in the water as the search for food before flying back to their burrows.

The island is also home to one of the very few colonies of black rats in Britain.

Today the island is inhabited by the Historic Scotland monument manager and a residential steward, along with non-resident staff duties include running the shop, maintaining the site and assisting with landing boats.

<doc id="616415" wikidata="Q917858" url="?curid=616415" title="The Burren">
<text>The Burren ( ; ) is a karst/glaciokarst landscape centred in County Clare, on the west coast of Ireland. It measures around , within the circle made by the villages of Lisdoonvarna, Corofin, Gort and Kinvara. The area includes such natural features as Mullaghmore hill and Ailladie cliffs, and historic monuments such as Poulnabrone dolmen and Caherconnell Stone Fort.
The Burren National Park covers a small part of the Burren and is the smallest of the eight National Parks in Ireland, while the adjacent territory, including the Cliffs of Moher, is included in the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark.

==Location==

While the name is generally applied to the limestone uplands of northwestern Clare, and adjacent lowlands, and generally excludes the area of &quot;Clare shales&quot; to the southwest, the exact extent of the area is not clearly defined, and geologically it does extend into County Galway to both the north and northeast (see &quot;Geology&quot; below). The southeastern pocket of County Galway around Kinvara is usually included, and is the base for many Burren organisations. 
The Burren is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and by Galway Bay, with the Aran Islands representing a geological extension of the limestone hills that make up most of The Burren.

According to one definition, the Burren extends south to a line from the coastal resort of Lahinch to Corofin and is delimited in the east by a line roughly from Kinvara to Kilmacduagh monastery, near Gort. Note that taken literally, this would includes places like the town of Ennistymon and the Cliffs of Moher, which would more commonly be considered as neighbouring the Burren. In another definition, the agriculture focused &quot;Burren Programme&quot; defines the region as extending well into the Gort plain, encompassing inter alia Coole Park and the turloughs around it, while to the south it would extend to Ruan and Crusheen, and in the southwest to the edge of Doolin, as well as the routine Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and Corofin.

Thus the stated size of the Burren varies between around (the core area of exposed limestone), through (taking in all limestone landscapes) and 560 square kilometers (including the about of downland), depending on the approach taken. Roughly 60% of the uplands show exposed limestone pavement.

==Climate==
The Burren has a temperate oceanic climate. Average air temperatures range from in July to in January, while the soil temperature does not usually drop below 6¬†¬∞C (as an exception, in late 2010, there was a prolonged period of snow). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above 6¬†¬∞C, this means that The Burren (like the neighbouring Aran Islands) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth.

The area has around of annual rainfall (more than twice the amount observed in eastern Ireland), with an average level of over monthly from October to January

Late May is the sunniest time, and also a good time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later).

During counter-guerrilla operations in The Burren in 1651‚Äì52, Edmund Ludlow stated, &quot;(Burren) is a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him... and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and nourishing.&quot;

==Geology==


===Stratigraphy===
The area is formed from a thick succession of sedimentary rocks, largely limestones but also including sandstones, mudstones and siltstones. All of the solid rocks exposed at the surface are of Carboniferous age though they are underlain at depth by Old Red Sandstone of Devonian age which in turn overlies rocks of Lower Palaeozoic age. None of the pre-Carboniferous rocks is seen at the surface in the area. The limestones, which date from the Visean stage of the early Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 325 million years ago. The strata contain fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins and ammonites. This bed of limestone is up to 800 metres thick. In the north and west it lies on a shelf of Galway granite which supported the upper layers, preventing shifts like those that created the &quot;twisted&quot; hills Knockanes and Mullaghmore. The limestone also extends below Galway Bay out to the Aran Islands and to the east into the Gort plain.

Later in the Carboniferous (c. 318 million years ago), the limestone was covered by darker sand and mud that later turned into shale (the lower &quot;Clare Shales&quot;) and sandstone (the upper &quot;Millstone Grit&quot;). These layers reached a thickness of up to in north Clare. These top layers protected the underlying limestone from erosion for millions of years before being largely stripped away by glaciers, except in the south west, where they still extend from Doolin to Slieve Elva, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and to the western shore of Lake Inchiquin. One &quot;island&quot; of shale is the hill Poulacapple, southwest of Ballyvaughan, where an upland moor has formed on top of the impermeable shale layers.

The local geological succession comprises the following formations some of which are subdivided into various members. The youngest rocks are at the start of the list, the oldest at the bottom. The first three listed are of Namurian age and are a mix of mudstones, sandstones and siltstones, the remainder are Visean age limestones.

===Quaternary===

Glaciation during the late Quaternary period (beginning c. one million years ago) facilitated greater denudation. Glaciers expanded and retreated over the region several times. Of the last two periods the first was the more pronounced, covering the whole of the Burren. The last advance of the ice cover was more limited, affecting only the eastern Burren.

The result is that the Burren is one of the finest examples of glacio-karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the Burren overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any surface karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and the Burren karst is thus very recent in geological terms.

Solutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. This has formed numerous cave systems of which more than 50 kilometres have been mapped. The most accessible of these is Aillwee Cave.

Due to the processes mentioned, there are very few permanent surface rivers in the region. The Caher, flowing into the sea at Fanore, is one of the most stable. Some of the large valleys, mostly running south to north, that are still visible today are in fact the remains of pre-glacial river valleys. The rivers disappeared from the surface when the upper layers of stone had been stripped away.

Another characteristic feature of the Burren is closed roughly circular depressions with no surface outlets for water (called poljes). Around 100 of these exist, mostly in the eastern Burren. The most notable are the valleys of Kilcorney, Poulawilan, Caherconnel and Carran, generally stretching from northeast to southwest. The largest is the Carran depression, more than two miles long, up to a mile wide and over 200 feet deep. This is where the pre-glacial rivers of the area first eroded away the upper layers and started to dissolve the exposed limestone. Some of the smaller ones were created when caves underneath collapsed (one example of this is the Glen of Clab).

Glaciers also deposited numerous granite and limestone erratics on the pavements. The former were carried south across Galway Bay by the second-to-last glaciation. Granite boulders can be found mostly in the north of the Burren. The final ice cover came from the northeast and mostly deposited limestone erratics. On Slieve Elva these are visible today at elevations of up to mabove sea level. The characteristic terracing of the hills occurred when vertical joints weathered and large blocks of limestone fell off and were further eroded away.

Towards the very end of the Ice Age the glaciers ended for a time at Fanore. At that time, Slieve Elva and Knockauns hill alone rose above the surrounding ice fields. The valleys facing Galway Bay had been widened considerably by glacial action, first when the ice moved south from Connemara and then when meltwater sought a runoff. When the ice finally retreated it also left moraines in valley bottoms and the characteristic drumlins (most of them on top of the shale and sandstone to the south). The Caher Valley was almost choked up by deposited sand and rocks and these also piled up against the western slopes of Slieve Elva. It was this protective layer of sediment that has made surface streams locally possible once more.

Today, the uplands&#x27; highest point is on the hill Slieve Elva, whose shale cover rises to above sea level.

==Landscape types and habitats==
In addition to the limestone pavement, major landscape types, providing the habitats for the flora and fauna, include limestone heath, dry calcareous grasslands, calcareous (calcifying or petrifying) springs, the intermittent water bodies called turloughs, bogs, &quot;Cladium&quot; fens, lakes, wet grasslands, scrub and light woodland, and neutral, and farm-improved, grasslands.

==Flora, fauna and funga==

===Flora===
The Burren is renowned for its remarkable assemblage of plants and animals, and over 70% of Ireland&#x27;s species of flowers are found there. The region supports Arctic‚Äìalpine and Mediterranean Basin plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment.

The region supports many rare Irish species, some of which are only found in this area. Others occur in similar karst areas in western Ireland. Notable plants include &quot;Festuca indigesta&quot; seen in 1949 and &quot;Arenaria norvegica&quot; identified only once, in 1961. Two of the 24 types of &quot;Taraxacum&quot; found here are &quot;practically unique to the Burren&quot;. 23 of the 28 types of orchids found in Ireland grow in the Burren, including unique forms such as &quot;Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. okellyi&quot;.

The grikes (crevices in the limestone) provide moist shelter, supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the limestone pavement is shattered into gravel many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found, while when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil patches of grass are seen, interspersed with herbaceous plants. Among the flowers recorded from the Burren is the spring gentian, an alpine plant with bright blue flowers that are used as a symbol for the area by the national tourist board, Failte Ireland. The Irish orchid (&quot;Neotinea maculata&quot; and 21 other species of orchids ) and bloody cranesbill (&quot;Geranium sanguineum&quot;) also occur. Other notable flowers are &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot;, &quot;Platanthera chlorantha&quot;, &quot;Ophrys insectifera&quot; &quot;Euphrasia salisburgensis&quot;, &quot;Lathyrus linifolius&quot;, &quot;Carlina vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Centaurium erythraea&quot;, &quot;Succisa pratensis&quot;, &quot;Primula veris&quot;, &quot;Filipendula vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Parnassia palustris&quot;, &quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;Helianthemum oelandicum&quot;, &quot;Polygala vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Saxifraga hypnoides&quot;, &quot;Potentilla fruticosa&quot;, &quot;Antennaria dioeca&quot;, &quot;Primula vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Hypericum androsaemum&quot;, &quot;Asperula cynanchica&quot;, &quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot;, &quot;Blackstonia perfoliata&quot; and &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;. Another prominent presence in limestone grikes are around 24 species of fern, such as the Mediterranean &quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot;.

The area is notable for the unusually close vicinity of both plants that hate lime and those that do well on it. Acid-loving plants such as &quot;Calluna&quot; grow well on patches of acidic peat that effectively isolates them from the underlying basic limestone.

Woody plant encroachment by &quot;Blackthorn&quot; and &quot;Hazel&quot; is a common phenomenon in the Burren. It is managed through extensive low input farming and active thinning of high density stands.

===Fauna===
Of the more than 30 species of butterflies and moths found in Ireland only two are not present in the Burren. Notable insects present in the Burren include the butterflies the pearl-bordered fritillary (&quot;Boloria euphrosyne&quot;), brown hairstreak (&quot;Thecla betulae&quot;), marsh fritillary (&quot;Euphydryas aurinia&quot;) and wood white (&quot;Leptidea sinapis&quot;); the moths, the Burren green (&quot;Calamia tridens&quot;, which is only present in Ireland in this area), Irish annulet (&quot;Gnophos dumetata&quot;) and transparent burnet (&quot;Zygaena purpuralis&quot;); the hoverfly &quot;Doros profuges&quot; and the water-beetle &quot;Ochthebius nilssoni&quot;. This last species is known from just five sites in the world, its type locality in northern Sweden and four marl lakes in The Burren.

The Burren is one of the main breeding areas in Ireland of the European pine marten. Also present are badgers, foxes and stoats. The hillsides of the Burren also host herds of feral goats. All seven species of bats present in Ireland can be found in The Burren. Otters live along the coast, as do grey seals.

A wide range of bird species are also found in the Burren, including crows and ravens, peregrine falcons, kestrels and various gulls.

===Funga===
The Burren&#x27;s limestone pavements support a diverse assemblage of lichens (i.e., growing on substrates rich in calcium carbonate) adapted to the area&#x27;s unique geomorphological features. Over 130 lichen stands have been documented, with species distribution influenced by gradients of moisture, nutrient availability, and insolation. and foliose cyanophilic lichens dominate many surfaces, particularly in more mesic microhabitats such as kamenitzas and shaded grikes, where species like &quot;Callome multipartita&quot;, &quot;Lempholemma botryosum&quot;, and &quot;Leptogium schraderi&quot; grow. Exposed rock surfaces typically host non-cyanophilic crustose species, including &quot;Circinaria calcarea&quot; and various &quot;Verrucaria&quot; species, with some communities influenced by nutrient enrichment from bird perches. Unlike other limestone environments, the Burren does not show a clear ecological succession from endolithic to epilithic species.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Archaeological evidence from cave finds of butchered bones have been radiocarbon dated to 33,000 years ago, showing evidence of hunters during the Ice Age.

Pollen analysis indicates that in the Mesolithic period of 8000 to 7000 BC The Burren looked completely different from today, with most of the uplands covered in a mixture of deciduous, pine and yew trees. No clear evidence of Mesolithic settlements or camp sites in the area has yet been discovered. At the limits of the region, near Lake Inchiquin and at the so-called &quot;Doolin Axe Factory&quot;, stone artifacts have been discovered that may be Mesolithic in origin. However, by the Neolithic, c. 4000 BC, settlers had clearly arrived and began changing the landscape through deforestation, likely by overgrazing and burning, and the building of stone walls. These people also constructed Megalithic sites like the portal tomb known as Poulnabrone dolmen and the court tombs at Teergonean (near Doolin) and Ballyganner (near Noughaval). Overall, there are around 70 megalithic tombs in the Burren area, more than half of all of these structures found in Clare.

The most numerous type of prehistoric structure (apart from stone walls) in The Burren is the late-Neolithic/early-Bronze Age wedge tomb, mostly dated to the period 2500 to 2000 BC. It accounts for around 90% of the region&#x27;s megalithic tombs. Many examples of these are found on Roughan Hill near Kilnaboy, including those at Parknabinnia and Creevagh. Others are located at Gleninsheen and Berneens (Rathborney) and Poulaphuca (Carran). Large stone cairns on many hills, such as the Poulawack Cairn, also date from this period.

The economy at that time was likely based on pastoral farming in fairly small groups. As is still done today, the cattle were moved in a reverse of the usual seasonal pattern: cattle are moved to the uplands in the winter, allowing year round grazing.

Evidence of Beaker pottery was found on Roughan Hill, but in general few signs of the actual settlements of the Neolithic people have been found. This may be due to the fact that their structures were lightly built (from wood or other non-permanent materials).
During the Bronze Age, locals also built many &quot;Fulachtai fiadh&quot;, remains of more than 300 survive in the region. Their exact function is still debated, but they probably served as places where water was heated by fire, either for cooking, brewing or bathing purposes.

However, in contrast to the quantity of archaeological evidence found, the population of The Burren likely declined noticeably between the late Neolithic and the end of the Bronze Age. This was likely largely due to a shift in the climate, possibly related to the volcanic eruption known as &quot;Hekla 4&quot;. Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC temperatures dropped and the climate became wetter. Heavy rainfall combined with previous clearing activity to cause serious soil erosion in the uplands. Evidence suggests that much of the soil cover over the limestone karst was in fact removed during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. This reduction in the area of fertile land put pressure on population numbers and probably increased conflicts over scarce resources. Building of new stone walls largely came to an end ‚Äì there is a gap in documented building between the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and early Christian periods. By the end of the Bronze Age, the uplands were largely depopulated.

Nevertheless, like the Mooghaun North Hoard found near Newmarket-on-Fergus, the discovery of a golden Bronze Age gorget in Gleninsheen townland indicates the (at least temporary) local presence of a late Bronze Age society that was rich, mobile and well-connected via trade networks with other regions.

Like in many places of Ireland, datable Iron Age sites are rare in The Burren. This may be due to the use of dwellings that did not leave durable traces (wooden buildings or even tents). Some of the extant r√°ths, cashels or cahers may actually have Iron Age origins. However, few have been excavated and those that have been the subject of research, like Cahercommaun, Caherconnel, Cahermore or Ballyallaban, are thought to be early medieval or later in origin. The large enigmatic enclosure of Turlough Hill (see Oughtmama) may be Iron Age or earlier. Definite regional findings from this era are limited to a few bronze horse bridles discovered near Corofin and at Ballyalla (Kilshanny).

===Medieval===

In the Iron Age and early medieval times, the region was controlled by a family or tribe known as the &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot;, meaning &quot;seed&quot; or &quot;people of Modhruadh&quot;. They were one of dozens of minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (&quot;tuath&quot;) and were joined by a common bloodline or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).

During the 5th and 6th centuries, the region appears to have been ruled from the Aran Islands by the &quot;E√≥ganacht √Årann&quot;, a minor branch of the E√≥ganacht dynasty of Munster.

The history of these years is uncertain, but after the decline of the &quot;E√≥ganacht √Årann&quot; the local &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot; likely fell under the control of the &quot;U√≠ Fiachrach Aidhne&quot;, a tribe from what is now southern Galway, who prospered in the 7th century. The local tribes were then probably subjects of the &quot;E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in&quot; until their influence declined in the early 9th century. Whether the &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot; still existed as a distinct group at that point is uncertain, as they and their neighbours &quot;Corcu Baiscind&quot; may have been assimilated into or conquered by the &quot;D√©isi Tuisceart&quot; of eastern Clare, who won a major battle against the &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot; in 744. By the 9th century, the &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot; had been driven into the Burren uplands.

The Burren area is notable for the presence of several potential or likely &quot;early&quot; (i.e. pre-12th-century) ecclesiastical or monastic sites. These include Kilfenora, Kilnaboy, Temple Cronan and the churches of Oughtmama. A broader definition of The Burren would also include Dysert O&#x27;Dea Monastery near Corofin and Kilmacduagh. The large number of extant cashels, almost 500 of which have been identified in The Burren (out of around 45,000 in Ireland), also indicates the presence of a sizeable (early) medieval population that supported and used these churches.

At the end of the first millennium, the &quot;D√°l gCais&quot; expanded into the region, against the resistance of the incumbent U√≠ Lochlainn and O&#x27;Conor families. The later regionally dominant O&#x27;Brien dynasty traced its origins to them. Evidence of Viking activity in the region is scant. They settled at Limerick, but in the Burren only a few artifacts of Scandinavian design have been found, centred mostly on Cahercommaun, which apparently was a major producer of wool at the time. A Viking arrowhead was found at the ringfort and a Viking hollow-bead necklace (likely dating from 820 to 850 AD) was discovered in nearby Glencurran Cave.

Either at the end of the 12th or early in the 13th century, Cistercian monks came to the area and established &quot;Sancta Maria de Petra Fertili&quot;, now known as Corcomroe Abbey.

In the 12th century, the &quot;Corco Modhruadh&quot;/Corcomroe territory was made into the newly created Diocese of Kilfenora, of 13 parishes, and the church at Kilfenora became a cathedral.

At some point around the 12th century, the territory of &quot;Corcomroe&quot; was divided in two for administrative purposes: &quot;Corco Modhruadh Iartharach&quot; (&quot;Western Corcomroe&quot;) and &quot;Corco Modhruadh Oirthearach&quot; (&quot;Eastern Corcomroe&quot;), also known as &quot;Boireann&quot; which in the late 16th century became the English administrative Baronies of Corcomroe and Burren, respectively.

The end of the medieval period was a difficult era for people in the area. Like much of Europe, the region suffered from the Great Famine (1315-7) and the Black Death. In addition, infighting between the Gaelic lords contributed to a socio-economic decline of the region. This was also reflected in a regional hiatus in large construction projects during the 13th and most of the 14th century.

===Early Modern===
For a long-time the Anglo-Norman incursions into Ireland had little direct impact on the region. As late as at the Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea in 1318 some of the local clans allied to defeat a Norman army led by Richard de Clare. The people and their rulers thus continued to live in fortified houses, often inside the cashels, mostly retaining their Gaelic culture. One example of this are the Brehon law schools of the O&#x27;Davorans at Cahermacnaghten or the MacClancys at Doolin.

Only in the 15th and 16th centuries did the tower houses as exemplified today by places like Newtown Castle, Shanmuckinish Castle, Doonagore Castle or Ballinalacken Castle become widespread. Norman-type castles, such as the one built at Quin, were absent in the Burren. T.J. Westropp counted the remains of around 70 tower houses in the Baronies of Inchiquin, Corcomroe and Burren, with 21 of them located in the latter. Only around half of those 21 survive to any height in the 21st century. The distribution of the tower houses indicates that they were built close to the barony borders, which also represented the boundaries of the territories controlled by clans or families (see below). 11 of the 21 tower houses in the Barony of Burren lie within 1¬†km of its borders.

The O&#x27;Loughlin (√ì Lochlainn) clan ruled &quot;Boireann&quot; down to the mid-17th century from their chief residence at Gregans Castle (the tower house, not the house of the same name). The chief of the family was known in later times as the &#x27;Prince of Burren&#x27; and clan members were buried in the family tomb near the altar of Corcomroe Abbey. Their kinsmen, the O&#x27;Conor (√ì Conchubhair), clan ruled &quot;Corco Modhruadh Iartharach&quot; from Dough Castle near Liscannor. The villages and towns found within the medieval territory of Boireann include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay (Newquay) / Burrin (Burren), Noughaval, Bealaclugga (Bellharbour), Carron and Fanore / Craggagh.

Both clans were eventually subjects of the O&#x27;Briens, the rulers of Thomond. Especially in the southwest, the O&#x27;Briens sometimes extended their direct influence, taking over houses and territories for themselves. They controlled the castles at Dromoland and Leamaneh and later became the Barons Inchiquin.

==Culture==
The Burren has a long history of traditional Irish music. It is particularly known for the &quot;West Clare Style&quot; of concertina playing, and music festivals in Doolin and Corofin. The area also has a long history as a source of artistic inspiration, and has hosted a number of art galleries.

The Burren has inspired many non-fiction books, often accompanied by extensive illustration of the landscape.

A series of detective fiction novels, written by Cora Harrison, features the Burren&#x27;s brehon judge (fictional) in the early 1500s, when the area still existed as a distinct Gaelic administration.

==Economic activity==
The leading economic activities in the Burren are agriculture and tourism.

===Tourism===

The Burren has a reputation beyond Ireland, and, most notably with the Cliffs of Moher, but also with the major show caves, dolmens such as at Poulnabrone and other prehistoric sites, and centres of cultural activity, attracts tourists from a wide range of countries. There are a range of hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast facilities, and other accommodation providers.

Tourism presents some challenges in such an environmentally sensitive area, as it creates mostly seasonal employment, results in a large share of local houses being used only in the summer, and puts additional strain on environmental resources, thus exacerbating the effect of a significant increase in the number of houses in some areas during the 1990s and 2000s. This has been a thread in the development and preservation activities previously discussed, and has driven the growth of local ecotourism, and the &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; local campaigns. Concerns have also arisen about the level of day-tourism, especially by coaches, as opposed to overnight-staying tourists, who generate significantly more revenue.

====Ecotourism in the Burren====
Ecotourism is an important factor in The Burren, with many organisations involved, including the Burren Ecotourism Network. A key goal is to deal with the challenge of protecting the vulnerable landscape, while at the same time having it provide a fair income for the local inhabitants and allowing it to cope with increased visitor numbers. Sustainable ecotourism and independent &quot;&#x27;Ecotourism Certification&quot; for companies are intended to deal with those conflicting demands.

====Gastro-tourism====
A Burren Food Trail was launched in 2013, and has more than 20 members offering hospitality, and / or food and drink products. The trail won the Irish prize in the European Destination of Excellence - Tourism and Local Gastronomy competition in 2015. In association with the food trail events such as a Slow Food festival and a Food Fayre are organised. The Food Fayre, part of the Burrenbeo-coordinated Winterage Festival around the October public holiday weekend, and run by the Burren Ecotourism Network and the Burren Food Trail team, reached its sixth year in 2017.

===Agriculture===

Due to climate and landscape, and techniques evolved over thousands of years, the Burren has a history as a productive agricultural landscape. Arable farming is limited, and the main animals kept are cattle and goats.

As summarized by the local landscape organisation, the Burrenbeo Trust, the traditional local system of cattle husbandry &quot;involves exploiting the unusual attributes afforded by the region&#x27;s limestone geology. Up until quite recently, hardy native breeds of beef cattle were used to graze upland grasslands between the months of October and April, requiring scarcely any dietary supplement prior to their removal to finishing grass elsewhere.&quot; Thus the agricultural methods used but also protected the landscape.

====Challenges====
Since the 20th century the spread of intensive farming techniques (including sometimes heavy use of nitrate fertilisers) along with the possibilities offered by heavy equipment to transform limestone pavement into pasture has posed new challenges for the ecosystem and its diversity. Research conducted in the 1990s suggests that by the end of that decade the area of limestone pavement had halved since pre-Famine times, c. 1840, while from the 1970s to the 1990s alone, about 4% of pavements were converted into pasture or covered by roads.

Despite the intensification of agriculture on the uplands, population numbers fell from around 4,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to roughly 2,500 by the time of the 1991 Census, before rising once more. The number of farmers fell by 8% in the 1990s and the average farm size increased to by 2001.

A particular issue arose from the increasing spread of brush, notably hazel, but also blackthorn and hawthorn. These colonised more of the limestone area as a result of reduced grazing by cattle and goats. The increasing industrialization of agriculture and the introduction of different breeds of cattle led to shifts in cattle-raising practices ‚Äì away from winter grazing, which kept down new growth, and towards supplementary feeding. In addition, in the past saplings were often pulled from fields by hand to maintain grazing areas. Trees also used to be harvested for firewood, hazel rods were used for thatching as well as for fence- and basket-making. As these practices ceased, the brush advanced. This notably reduces biodiversity in the affected areas.

====BurrenLIFE====
In response to under-grazing, loss of husbandry and land management traditions, and abandonment and consolidation of farms, the BurrenLIFE program, coordinated by the geopark, launched a new sustainable farming initiative. This began with twenty farms, representative of the diversity of local agriculture, for each of which a specific plan of costed actions was devised. After refinement, the initiative was extended to 320 farmers over two phases, and another 130 are expected to join a final phase. Typical recommendations enacted included scrub clearance, restoration of drystone walls, reduction in silage usage and a return to winter grazing.

===Balancing needs===
For the past decades, the government and private groups have attempted to square the demands of local farmers, tourists and the environment. In particular, sometimes outdated or leaky septic tanks used by rural houses have contributed to the damage done to groundwater by agricultural practices. In a limestone environment, the use of percolation and septic tanks may in fact not be a viable alternative to sewage treatment. However, this is still lacking in much of the area. The sewage of the village of Ballyvaughan, for example, is still pumped untreated into the sea.

===Development initiatives===
Community and local authority programs have been launched over decades, notably a County Council initiative of the mid-2000s, which became &quot;Burren Connect&quot; in 2006, and led, in 2011, to the geopark, which in turn secured funding for the Geopark LIFE program. The Burrenbeo Trust, Burren Ecotourism Network and Burren Way Committee are other examples.

==Designations==
Most of the Burren is today designated as a Special Area of Conservation, including almost all upland, and much of the lowland and northern shore areas. There are also designated Areas of Scientific Interest and Natural Heritage Areas.

===Geopark===

The Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, formed in 2011 on the basis of earlier community and local authority work, is part of the Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and recognised by UNESCO since that year. Encompassing an expansively defined Burren, including the Cliffs of Moher, it is managed by the Clare County Council and supported by Failte Ireland and the Geological Survey of Ireland. The boundary of the Geopark extends from the vicinity of New Quay on Galway Bay, southeast to the Tubber area, then southwest to Corrofin then roughly west towards Doolin and includes the coastal strip containing the Cliffs of Moher. The geopark supports education and community engagement and sustainable tourism and other development, and employs a full-time geologist, Dr. Eamon N. Doyle.

===National Park===
The Burren National Park is one of eight National Parks in the country. Taking in a modest sampling of the southeastern Burren, about , it is made up of land purchased by the Irish government to be set aside for conservation purposes. After a prolonged controversy (see Mullaghmore and the Burren Action Group), the planned construction of a visitor centre was shelved. The National Park currently has an information point at Corofin. It is also associated with the preservation area at nearby Dromore Wood.

==Sport and leisure==
The Burren&#x27;s many limestone cliffs, particularly the sea-cliffs at Ailladie, are popular with rock-climbers. For cavers, there are a number of charted caves in the area, notably Pollnagollum. Doolin is a popular &quot;base camp&quot; for cavers, and is home to one of the two main cave-rescue stores of the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation.

The Burren is popular with walkers and trails include the Burren Way, often taken over a five-day period, and the Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk of .

The Burren also has a range of local Gaelic Athletic Association clubs, soccer clubs and other sporting groups.

<doc id="616416" wikidata="Q538968" url="?curid=616416" title="Avro York">
<text>The Avro York was a British transport aircraft developed by Avro during the Second World War. The design was derived from the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber, several sections of the York and Lancaster being identical. Due to the importance of Lancaster production, York output proceeded slowly until 1944, after which a higher priority was placed upon transport aircraft.

The York saw service in military and civilian roles with various operators between 1943 and 1964. In civilian service, British South American Airways (BSAA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) were the largest users of the type. In military service, large numbers of Yorks were used for air-supply missions during the Berlin Blockade 1948‚Äì49. A number of the type were used as air transports of heads of state and government; VIPs who flew on Yorks included British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, French General Charles de Gaulle, Indian Governor-General Lord Mountbatten and South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts.

==Development==

===Origins===
During 1941, Avro elected to begin development of a new civil-orientated transport aircraft. In the midst of an uncertain stage of the Second World War, Britain&#x27;s aircraft industry was preoccupied by urgent wartime demands, not only to produce military aircraft, but to design increasingly capable models as well. The company&#x27;s decision to embark on this venture was considered to be ambitious, especially as the development project operated with no official backing early on. The project may well have been influenced by a shortage of transport aircraft, as well as by the formation of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), in 1940, to run all of the nation&#x27;s overseas civil air routes. However, according to aviation author Donald Hannah, there was little incentive and few materials available for the construction of transport aircraft, it was impossible to predict when the war would end and, thus, when large-scale demand for civil aircraft would return.

Roy Chadwick, Avro&#x27;s chief designer, had foreseen a need for a transport aircraft that was powered by four engines and would be capable of flying for long distances. The design, which was designated as the &quot;Type 685&quot;, had its origins in the company&#x27;s then-newly developed four-engined bomber, the Avro Lancaster, which had made its first flight only earlier that year. The &quot;Type 685&quot; paired various elements of the Lancaster, such as its wings, tail assembly and undercarriage and Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, with a new square-section fuselage that provided double the internal capacity of the Lancaster. The two aircraft also substantially differed in external appearance.

In February 1942, Chadwick submitted his drawings to Avro&#x27;s experimental department. Within five months, the company refined the design and had quickly assembled an initial prototype. On 5 July 1942, the York prototype, &quot;LV626&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Ringway Airport, Manchester. It had initially been fitted with the twin fins and rudders of the Lancaster but the increased fuselage side area forward of the wing compared to the Lancaster necessitated fitting a third central fin to retain adequate control and directional stability; the third fin was fitted as standard on subsequent production aircraft. Flight trials of &quot;LV626&quot; were quickly transferred to RAF Boscombe Down. In response to the prototype&#x27;s favourable performance during trials, the Air Ministry issued an order for three more prototypes of various configurations to be built along with an initial production batch under Specification C.1/42, part of Operational Requirement OR.113 for a new transport aircraft.

The prototypes were used to test various adaptions and potential roles for the aircraft. &quot;LV626&quot;, the first prototype, was rebuilt to the &quot;C.II standard&quot;, the principal modification of which was the installation of Bristol Hercules VI radial engines in place of the Merlins; it was later decided to standardise on the Merlin engine, leaving this as the sole Hercules-powered York. The fourth prototype, &quot;LV639&quot;, was furnished as a paratroop transport, complete with ventral dropping doors. However, flight testing found that the York was unsuited to this role, due to the slipstream wash drawing the parachutes towards the fixed tailwheel, posing an entanglement risk.

===Production===
Production of the York proved difficult to speed up, due to shortages of key materials. Moreover, Avro was also obliged to place a high priority on the manufacturing and refinement of the Lancaster. Officials had also judged that there was no requirement for large numbers of Yorks at that time. By the end of 1943, only the four prototypes and three production aircraft had been manufactured, but production was scheduled to rise to three aircraft per month throughout 1944. Early production Yorks were principally used as a VIP transport aircraft; notably, the third prototype, &quot;LV633&quot; being luxuriously fitted out and becoming the personal transport of Winston Churchill.
On 25 March 1943, RAF Transport Command had been formed, which soon established a clear requirement for the strengthening of Britain&#x27;s air transport forces; the York became the first British aircraft to be used in quantity by Transport Command. The first Royal Air Force (RAF) production order consisted of 200 aircraft; while a further 100 were ordered under a second order placed shortly after. Throughout 1944, the majority of Yorks produced were passenger transport aircraft, a batch of both pure freighters and combined passenger/freighter-configured Yorks were also manufactured. Several early production aircraft intended for RAF service were instead diverted to BOAC, who had otherwise received little in the way of similar aircraft prior to delivery of the first York in April 1944.

Initial assembly and testing of production Yorks, which were principally destined for service with the RAF at that time, was performed at Ringway, reaching its peak in 1945; these activities later being transferred to facilities in Yeadon, Leeds and Woodford, Cheshire, where work was undertaken at a slower pace. Only eight aircraft of the second order for 100 aircraft were produced; in April 1948, the final York, &quot;PE108&quot;, was completed.

Abroad, a single pattern aircraft was completed by Victory Aircraft in Canada; however, no further orders were received. Victory had tooled up for the manufacture of 30 aircraft and had built parts for five aircraft, but, ultimately, only one would be completed around the time that the war came to an end. This aircraft would later be purchased by Skyways Ltd.

==Design==
The Avro York was a high-wing cantilever monoplane, using an all-metal construction, with many similarities to the Lancaster from which it was derived. The wings used a two-spar structure, which housed seven internal fuel tanks between the spars, containing . The outboard panels of the wings were tapered on both edges and were furnished with detachable tips. The wings featured all-metal hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps and carry the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in four underslung nacelles attached to the front wing spar. Each engine drove a three-bladed constant-speed fully feathering metal propeller, manufactured by de Havilland Hydromatic. The fuselage was of a semi-monocoque construction, complete with a flush-rivetted skin, and was built in five separate sections.

In a typical passenger configuration, the York could accommodate a 21-seat three-abreast arrangement split between the fore and aft cabins. The main entrance door was set between the two cabins, along with cloakrooms and lavatory and a kitchen and baggage hold was located at the rear of the cabin. Emergency exits were present in the ceiling of each cabin. Passengers were subjected to very noisy conditions due to the aircraft&#x27;s engines, but from a pilot&#x27;s perspective, the York was reasonably pleasant to fly.

==Operational history==

===Military===
In 1945, No. 511 Squadron became the first squadron to be fully equipped with Yorks; eventually a total of ten squadrons of RAF Transport Command were wholly or partially equipped with the York. In military service, the York was used on all of the trunk routes operated by Transport Command, such as the critical England‚ÄìIndia route. Overall, 208 Yorks were manufactured for the RAF.

During the Berlin Airlift, RAF Yorks from seven different squadrons flew over 58,000 sorties to provide the city with vital supplies between 1948 and 1949. In total, in excess of 1,000,000 tons was carried by the York fleet; the type had borne close to half of the British contribution, alongside other aircraft such as the Douglas Dakota and Handley Page Hastings. Following the end of the Airlift, the RAF retired much of its York fleet; around 40 of these were sold onto civilian operators while many others were scrapped due to the onset of corrosion. During the 1950s, numerous military contracts were issued to civilian York operators.

In 1954, the French A√©ronavale procured five Yorks from the British Air Ministry and operated the type at Le Bourget for around a year.

===Civilian===
On 21 February 1944, the first civilian York (&quot;G-AGJA&quot;), initially built for the RAF as &quot;MW103&quot;, received its airworthiness certificate, thus clearing its delivery shortly thereafter to BOAC. On 22 April 1944, the York inaugurated an initial UK-Morocco-Cairo route. Following the diversion of the first five RAF production Yorks to BOAC, it was decided to allocate a further 60 to the airline but in fact only 25 more were delivered to BOAC. Early BOAC operations were conducted in close collaboration with No. 216 Group RAF; this led to some early Yorks bearing a confusing combination of both civilian registrations and military external markings.

Flights were soon established to Johannesburg, South Africa, in conjunction with South African Airways; Yorks assigned to this route fitted with a total of 12 sleeping berths in addition to passenger seating due to the journey time. The majority of BOAC&#x27;s York fleet were fully furnished passenger airliners or as combi passenger-cargo aircraft.

In the post-war years, BOAC expanded its use of the York considerably, such as on its Cairo to Durban service, which had previously been operated by Shorts flying boats. Other airlines also adopted the type, such as its use by British South American Airways (BSAAC) on their routes to the Caribbean and South America, prior to their merger into BOAC in September 1949.

On 7 October 1952, BOAC withdrew its Yorks from passenger services, retaining the type for freight operations. BOAC&#x27;s Yorks continued to operate freight schedules until November 1957 when the last example was withdrawn. After disposal by BOAC and BSAAC, their York fleets were purchased by several UK independent airlines and operated on both passenger and freight flights; these service often included long-distance trooping flights to Jamaica and other UK garrisons. The largest York operator out of the independents was Skyways. In 1964, the last Yorks were retired from service by Skyways and Dan Air.

When the Distant Early Warning Line (Dew Line) was being constructed in Canada in the late 1950s, the York was introduced as a freighter by Associated Airways to support the initiative, these being used later in ordinary airline service. At least one of the Yorks, &quot;CF-HAS&quot;, was retained, and was in service with Transair as late as 1961.

===VIP service===

The Avro York was, like its Lancaster and Lincoln stablemates, a versatile aircraft. One of the prototypes, &quot;LV633&quot;, &quot;Ascalon&quot;, was custom-built as the personal transport and flying conference room for King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. &quot;Ascalon&quot; was to be fitted with a special pressurised &quot;egg&quot; so that VIP passengers could be carried without their having to use an oxygen mask. Made of aluminium alloy, the enclosure had eight perspex windows to reduce claustrophobia. It also had a telephone, an instrument panel, drinking facilities and an ashtray with room for cigars, a thermos flask, newspapers and books. Testing at RAE Farnborough found the &quot;egg&quot; to work satisfactorily. Avro said it was too busy with the new Lancaster IV (Avro Lincoln) work so it was never installed in &quot;Ascalon&quot;. It was considered for installation in the successor aircraft, a Douglas C-54B but the contractor Armstrong Whitworth decided it was impractical and the project was shelved. The whereabouts of &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Egg&quot; are not known.

&quot;MW140&quot;, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, flew to Australia in 1945 to become the personal aircraft of the Duke of Gloucester, Australia&#x27;s Governor-General. It was operated by the Governor-General&#x27;s Flight from 1945 to 1947; it was the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s only York. Another York, &quot;MW102&quot; was fitted out as a &quot;flying office&quot; for the use of the Viceroy of India and C-in-C South East Asia Command, Lord Mountbatten. During its first major overhaul by Avro at Manchester (Ringway) in 1945, the aircraft was repainted a light duck egg green, a shade intended to cool down the aeroplane, instead of its former normal camouflage colour scheme. South African leader Jan Smuts also used a York as his personal transport. Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory was killed on 14 November 1944, while flying to his new posting in Ceylon to take command of Allied air operations in the Pacific, when York &quot;MW126&quot; struck a ridge in the French Alps in a blizzard, south of Grenoble, France. His wife Dora and eight aircrew also died. The wreckage was found by a villager in June 1945.

==Aircraft on display==
While there are no flying examples of the Avro York, there are two complete examples on display in the United Kingdom. Both aircraft were initially allocated to the RAF, but were used by civil operators for most of their flying careers; both aircraft were issued with military and civil registrations.

;Avro York &quot;TS798&quot;, &quot;G-AGNV&quot;

Avro 685 York C1, &quot;TS798&quot; (cn &quot;1223&quot;), now part of the collection of the RAF Museum. This aircraft was completed in October 1945 and intended for the RAF as &quot;TS798&quot;, but quickly passed to BOAC and given the civil registration &quot;G-AGNV&quot;. In BOAC service it flew routes in South Asia and Africa until 1950. In 1955 it was acquired by Skyways, who operated it until 1964.

It was sold to the Skyways airframe collection for preservation and made the last ever flight by a York when it flew from Heathrow to Gloucestershire Airport to join the collection. It was sold to the RAF Museum in 1972. In 1973 it was restored and painted in RAF markings to represent another aircraft, &quot;MW100&quot;; it was moved to the RAF Museum&#x27;s Cosford site in 1976, where it is currently displayed.

;Avro York &quot;MW232&quot;, &quot;G-ANTK&quot;

Displayed at the Imperial War Museum Duxford: Avro 685 York C1, &quot;G-ANTK&quot; is an ex-Dan Air London aircraft. This airframe was built at Yeadon, near Leeds, in January 1946 and entered RAF service with 242 Squadron as &quot;MW232&quot; that August. It joined the fleet of Allied aircraft engaged in the Berlin Airlift and in May 1947, the York moved to 511 Squadron at Lyneham, where it served until May 1950 when it was used by Fairey Aviation for flight refuelling research. It then retired to 12 Maintenance Unit at Kirkbride for storage prior to disposal. In July 1954, &quot;MW232&quot; became &quot;G-ANTK&quot; with Dan Air and it was used for freight work until its retirement in May 1964.

It was ferried to Lasham Airfield and used as a bunk house by the Air Scouts until 1974. The Dan Air preservation group took it over and began to restore the aircraft in their spare time. In the mid-1980s, Dan Air realised the impracticality of the restoration work being undertaken and began negotiations with the Duxford Aviation Society. In May 1986, the aircraft was dismantled and on 23 May made its journey to Duxford on seven low-loaders.

==Accidents and incidents==

The Avro York had 87 hull-loss accidents or incidents with the following list of accidents involving fatalities and major hull-losses. This information is primarily derived from: &quot;Piston Engine Airliner Production List&quot; (1991) and &quot;Aviation Safety Network&quot;.:

<text>Drumcondra () is a residential area and inner suburb on the Northside of Dublin, Ireland. It is administered by Dublin City Council. The River Tolka and the Royal Canal flow through the area.

== History ==
The village of Drumcondra was the central area of the civil parish of Clonturk, and the two names were used equally for the religious and civil parishes, but the modern suburban district of Drumcondra also encompasses the old Parish of St. Mary. Clonturk had been an alternative name for Drumcondra and the wider area for some time.

The Cat and Cage Pub, on the corner of Drumcondra Road and Church Avenue, was the site of an old postal stop and the point at which rebels, during the 1798 rebellion, seized a postal cart in order to signal to others in North County Dublin to revolt.

The southern stretch of the Slige Midluachra passed through Drumcondra and on into the City where it crossed the Liffey at a location known as the &quot;ford of the hurdles&quot;. The present-day Drumcondra main road is built on top of the exact route the ancient highway took, the road was one of five ancient roads to meet at Tara, albeit in myth only; in reality, the five roads may have met at a point on the River Liffey in Dublin.

The Richmond Road connects Fairview with Drumcondra on the northern side of the River Tolka and was laid out to provide access to Drumcondra Castle. The thoroughfare was a laneway until reputedly a jeweller and merchant called Francis Jacob Grose built a house called Richmond House in the mid-1700s, from which the road is thought to take its name. His house was on the site now occupied by St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Fairview. Kingston suggests that he named his house for Richmond, London. Grose&#x27;s son was the antiquarian, Francis Grose, who is buried at Drumcondra Church. Richmond House was bought by the Daughters of Charity and incorporated into St Vincent&#x27;s.

=== Housing and Drumcondra ===
Ireland as a whole yet specifically Dublin, was experiencing a large housing crisis during the 19th century. As the city expanded private development was built beyond the Royal Canal between Phibsboro and the North Strand, towards what became Saint Mobhi road; including much Alexander Strain built houses. However, it was only in the late 19th and early 20th century that local authorities began to take action to actively plan housing development.

==== Drumcondra&#x27;s Development Scheme ====
Dublin Corporation purchased what was former farming land west of St Patrick&#x27;s teacher training College. The bulk of the purchased land serviced by Dublin Corporation was developed as a tenant purchase project in c. 1928; mirroring a nearby, larger project in Marino and &#x27;The Tenters&#x27; in Dublin City. Roads in the new triangle shaped estate were named after a popular Archbishop of Dublin William Walsh, but mostly Irish language scholars and historians such as James Hardiman, Samuel Ferguson, John Windele, David Comyn and Patrick Joyce. The area north of here was sold to private developers, Building Societies and Trusts including the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust who built housing development on Home Farm Road and Griffith Avenue in the early 1930s.

The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust (ISSLT) was created originally in order to generate housing for ex-servicemen however due to WWI and war veterans now a factor, its priorities changed. The ISSLT was established in 1923 after the Land Trust Act was passed and was set up as an imperial trust working across Ireland. After a statement made by the Minister for Finance at the time Ernest Blythe, it was declared that there would be no contribution to the trust from the Free State and that the entire cost must be covered by the British government. Although this led to issues with the trust obtaining land, the ISSLT continued to construct houses across the Free State. They surpassed their targets and went on to build 2,720 cottages by 1930 across Dublin. They focused on creating housing for war veterans and focused on moving outside of Dublin&#x27;s city centre. Once the Trust completed its main building there were 20 separate housing schemes across the county of Dublin. Drumcondra was one of the top 3 major schemes they took on with 66 dwellings as part of the scheme. Although the size does not compare to that of Killester, its housing scheme was better integrated into the neighbouring development projects.

The housing built by the ISSLT in Drumcondra was constructed on land provided and serviced by Dublin Corporation, forming part of a &#x27;Reserved Area&#x27; north of Dublin Corporation&#x27;s housing scheme. The ISSLT purchased four and a half acres of the Drumcondra Reserved Area for its housing scheme. These houses built along what is now known as Lambay Road are conventional in design and built in blocks of four with some semi-detached cottages. These houses have extensive gardens in the front and back of each and look similar and therefore blend in with those of the Reserved Area scheme already set out by the Corporation. The ISSLT&#x27;s identity is clearly marked in Drumcondra by plaques displayed on houses through Lambay Road.

=== Local government and subdivisions ===

The Drumcondra, Clonliffe, and Glasnevin Township Act 1878 was a local act of the Westminster Parliament, sponsored by businessmen in Drumcondra, and created a township called Drumcondra, Clonliffe and Glasnevin, encompassing Drumcondra and the neighbouring districts of Clonliffe and Glasnevin, governed by a body of town commissioners. The portion of the district electoral division of Drumcondra outside the township was renamed Drumcondra Rural. The Dublin Corporation Act 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. cclxiv) absorbed the township into the county borough of Dublin as the wards of Drumcondra and Glasnevin. Part of Drumcondra Rural district electoral division was transferred to the city in 1931. The remainder was split into Drumcondra Rural Number One and Drumcondra Rural Number Two in 1971.

== Transport ==

* The district is served by Drumcondra railway station, on the main Drumcondra road. The station initially opened on 1 April 1901 but closed on 1 December 1910 with the termination of Kingsbridge (now Heuston Station) to Amiens Street (now Connolly Station) services. Part of the original building was demolished in late 1918. It reopened on 2 March 1998 as a station on the Maynooth/Longford commuter line.
* Many Dublin Bus routes serve the Drumcondra area, including the 1, 16, 19, 33, 41 and 41C. In addition, the Aircoach express coach service to Dublin Airport stops at the railway station.

== Features ==

One of the main sights of Dublin is Croke Park, where Ireland&#x27;s national games of Gaelic football and hurling may be seen. It has a capacity of 82,300 people, it is one of the largest sports stadiums in Europe. &#x27;Croker&#x27; (as it is colloquially known) is the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association and also houses the official GAA Museum (on St Josephs Avenue, which is off Clonliffe Road). The stadium hosts the finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. The stadium is a 20-minute walk from Dublin city centre or a 5-minute bus ride.

Fagan&#x27;s Public House, Drumcondra Road Lower, where Bertie Ahern took U.S. President Bill Clinton in September 1998. Kennedys Pub on Lower Drumcondra Road is one of the oldest pubs in Drumcondra, predating Fagans by a number of years. Formerly called McPhillips, it has been named Kennedys since 1961.

Tolka Park, the home of League of Ireland side Shelbourne since 1989, is situated on Richmond Road. The site has been used as a soccer pitch since the 1920s, initially by Drumcondra Football Club (Drums) and from 1972 by Home Farm Football Club.

The National Council for the Blind of Ireland (NCBI) at Whitworth Road was previously Drumcondra Hospital and is located adjoining the cemetery of St. George&#x27;s, whose former parish church is located at Temple Street.

== Notable buildings ==
=== Belvidere House, Drumcondra ===
Belvidere House, formerly the home of the Coghill family, this late 17th-century building became the residence of the Superior General of the Irish Christian Brothers, and a training centre for the order, in 1874. The house was bought by the Coghills in the early 1700s when it was known as Drishogue. In 1881, the Congregation bought and moved to Marino House, and sold Belvidere House to Cardinal Cullen. St Patrick&#x27;s College, Dublin which had been founded in 1875 at 2 Drumcondra Road Lower, relocated to Belvidere House in 1883. New college buildings were constructed, while the house became the residence of the Vincentian Fathers who ran the college. It now provides offices and meeting rooms for the St Patrick&#x27;s Campus of Dublin City University, into which the former college was incorporated in 2016.

=== Clonturk House ===
Clonturk House on Ormond Road was built prior to 1820, although its current appearance owes much to its renovation in 1880, at which time the stone balustrades from James Gandon&#x27;s Carlisle Bridge (O&#x27;Connell Bridge) were moved to Clonturk by its owner. In the early twentieth century it moved from private residential to institutional use, initially as the Ormond Commercial School for Boys and subsequently as a female orphanage run by the Presbyterian Church. In 1959 it was purchased by the Rosminian Fathers as a home for blind men. Well-known Dublin character Thomas Dudley (&quot;Bang Bang&quot;) was a resident until his death in 1980.

=== Drumcondra Castle ===
Originally the site of an Elizabethan castle built circa 1560, the castle was built by Meath man James Bathe on ecclesiastical land (belonging to the Priory of the Holy Trinity), granted to him. It was owned for many years by the Bathe family. In 1591, when the Castle was the residence of Sir William Warren, who had married the widow of John Bathe, thus acquiring the lands in Drumcondra for his lifetime. Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone married his third wife Mabel Bagenal here after he had eloped with her.

In 1677, James II granted the Drumcondra property to a Giles Martin and in 1703 it was purchased by Captain Chichester Philips. In 1870 it became St. Joseph&#x27;s Asylum for the Male Blind when the Carmelites bought the lands of Drumcondra Castle. The Rosminians were appointed by the Archbishop of Dublin to run services for the Blind in St. Joseph&#x27;s, Drumcondra, Dublin in 1955, the School, and since 2012, it is known as ChildVision, in 2014 the Rosminian order sold the lands in St. Joseph&#x27;s, but took out a 25-year lease on the houses and buildings which it will use for ChildVision. The Grace Park Woods housing estate was built on the former St. Joseph&#x27;s lands.

=== Drumcondra House ===
Drumcondra House was purchased by Rev. John Hand and in 1842 All Hallows College was established. Daniel O&#x27;Connell played a part in the purchase of Drumcondra House for All Hallows, from Dublin Corporation. Designed by the architect Sir Edward Lovett Pearce and was built in 1726 for Sir Marmaduke Coghill, from the nearby Belvedere House. The Coghills rented out the house for a time. All Hallows was sold to Dublin City University by the Vincentian Order in 2016.

=== Hampton Lodge/Carmelite Convent ===
For 150 years Hampton House and its lands held the Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation on Grace Park Road, housing members of this enclosed order of nuns. The order, which had been based in Blanchardstown, purchased Hampton House and moved in during 1858. Prior to it being a convent, Hampton Lodge was the residence of Thomas Williams, the first secretary of the Bank of Ireland, and his wife Mary Ann Williams; their son Richard Williams lived in Drumcondra Castle. The land and buildings were sold by the order in 2016 and were redeveloped as houses and a nursing home.

=== Distillery ===
A distillery, the Dublin Whiskey Distillers (D.W.D.), was founded in the 1870s on the banks of the River Tolka, and known as the Jones Road Distillery (Distillery Road is a continuation of Jones Road). The distillery closed in 1946 and the property was sold. A number of buildings were built and are still standing and a number of buildings although redeveloped retain the names connected with the distillery such as The Corn Mill, The Granary, The Grainstore and Distillery Lofts.

The &quot;Old Church of St. George&quot; was built about 1668 in Lower Temple Street (changed to Hill Street in the 1800s), then a part of Drumcondra. The Tower of the Old Church of St. George can still be seen on Hill Street and its gravestones are around the walls of what is now a playground.

The &quot;New Church of St. George&quot; was built on the square further up the road at the end of Temple Street in the early 1800s. The original site acquired for the new church was on Whitworth Road, but then the present site was selected, which at the time was open fields. A temporary chapel was built on the Whitworth Road site and its churchyard was retained when St. George&#x27;s was completed ‚Äì this site was later taken over by the Whitworth Hospital (later named Drumcondra Hospital). The gravestones can be seen behind the hospital.

Drumcondra is a parish in the Fingal South West deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, served by the Church of Corpus Christi at Home Farm Road. The palace of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin is situated alongside Clonliffe College (the former diocesan seminary). Together they occupy an extensive site bounded by Clonliffe Road and Drumcondra Road (to the South and West) with the River Tolka at the northern extremity; long proposed for housing development.

<text>In cryptography, PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards) are a group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC, starting in the early 1990s. The company published the standards to promote the use of the cryptography techniques for which they had patents, such as the RSA algorithm, the Schnorr signature algorithm and several others. Though not industry standards (because the company retained control over them), some of the standards have begun to move into the &quot;standards track&quot; processes of relevant standards organizations in recent years, such as the IETF and the PKIX working group.

Key Updates (2023‚Äì2024):

* Integration of PKCS #7 and PKCS #12 into broader standards like S/MIME and TLS.
* Evolution of PKCS #11 to support newer hardware and cloud services.
* Involvement of PKCS standards in post-quantum cryptography efforts, with NIST&#x27;s ongoing standardization.
* Growing adoption of PKCS standards in the context of blockchain and digital assets.

<doc id="616422" wikidata="Q3595202" url="?curid=616422" title="M. J. Akbar">
<text>Mobasher Jawed Akbar (born 11 January 1951) is an Indian journalist and politician, who served as the Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs until 17 October 2018. Akbar is a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha, and was inducted into the Union Council of Ministers by PM Narendra Modi on 5 July 2016. He is also a veteran Indian journalist and author of several books. He was a Member of Parliament between 1989 and 1991, and returned to public life in March 2014 when he joined the BJP and was appointed national spokesperson during the 2014 general elections that brought the party back to office with a simple majority under the leadership of Narendra Modi. In July 2015 he was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand. During his long career in journalism, he launched, as editor, India&#x27;s first weekly political news periodicals, including &quot;India Today&quot;, &quot;Headlines Today&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Asian Age&quot; and &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot;, among others.

He has written several non-fiction books, including a biography of Jawaharlal Nehru titled &quot;Nehru: The Making of India&quot;, a book on Kashmir titled &quot;Kashmir Behind the Vale&quot;, &quot;Riot After Riot&quot; and &quot;India: The Siege Within.&quot; He also authored &quot;The Shade of Swords,&quot; a history of &quot;jihad.&quot; Akbar has also authored fiction, such as &quot;Blood Brothers-A Family Saga (Fratelli Di Sangue,&quot; Italian translated version). &quot;Have Pen, Will Travel: Observations of a Globetrotter&quot; is a travelogue authored by him. His book &#x27;Byline&#x27; consists of write-ups of bylines picked from his writings. His book &quot;Tinderbox: The past and future of Pakistan&quot;, in January 2012 discusses the themes of identity crisis and class struggles in Pakistan. On 17 October 2018, Akbar resigned due to a number of sexual harassment allegations against him from numerous women who had worked with him over the years. Akbar has denied all such accusation and allegations.

He had filed a case against Priya Ramani for defamation who had accused Akbar of sexual harassment. Akbar had lost the case at the trial courts. As reported by Indian Express, court said, &quot;A woman has the right to put grievances before any platform of her choice even after decades. Reading out the order, the court said that there are social stigma attached with the allegations. Society must understand the impact of sexual abuse and harassment on its victims.&quot; The court also mentioned that in case of grievances, a fresh appeal could be filed. While Akbar didn&#x27;t comment on the decision, one of his lawyers Niharika Karanjawala remarked that they disagree with the court and will appeal. Akbar then approached the Delhi High Court and pleaded against the acquittal.

==Career==
Akbar joined &quot;The Times of India&quot; in 1971 as a trainee. Subsequently, he moved to &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India, &quot; then India&#x27;s largest-selling magazine, working as a sub-editor as well as distinguishing himself as a feature writer capable of contributing a prolific number of stories. He would remain with the weekly until 1973 when he was named editor of the news fortnightly, &quot;Onlooker,&quot; owned by &quot;The Free Press Journal Group&quot; in Mumbai. In 1976, he moved to Calcutta to join the Ananda Bazar Patrika (ABP) Group as editor of &quot;Sunday&quot;, a political weekly. Within just three years of its launch, the investigative reporting pioneered by the magazine established its national circulation and number one position. The magazine took an uncompromising stand against the Emergency and fought press censorship and dictatorship. &quot;Sunday&quot; not only established major trends in journalism but also spawned a new generation of journalists in the country.

In 1982, after the success of &quot;The Sunday&quot;, Akbar launched what is considered by some to be India&#x27;s first modern newspaper. He conceived, designed and edited the daily newspaper, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

In 1989, he took a brief detour into politics with his election to the Indian Parliament in November 1989 from Kishanganj in Bihar on a Congress(I) ticket. He lost the seat in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections. He served as late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s official spokesman.

In 1991, Akbar joined the Government as an adviser in the Ministry of Human Resources, and helped policy planning in key areas of education, the National Literacy Mission and in the protection of heritage. He resigned from the post and left politics in December 1992, returning to journalism and full-time writing. In 1993, Akbar started a new media company with the aim of &quot;creating India&#x27;s first newspaper that would not only include an international focus within its editorial range, but also be the first Indian daily with an international edition.&quot; This newspaper appeared in February 1994. The &quot;Asian Age&quot; was launched with initial editions in Delhi, Bombay, and London, and by 2008 had grown, in collaboration with the &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot;, to eight editions, into a major media presence nationally and internationally. In 2004, the group began publishing &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot; in India, and became a publishing partner of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Akbar was also the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Deccan Chronicle,&quot; a Hyderabad-based news daily.

In 2005, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia appointed him as a member of the committee to draft a ten-year charter for Muslim nations on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

In March 2006, Akbar joined the Brookings Institution, Washington, as a visiting fellow in the Brookings Project on U.S. Policy Towards the Islamic World. During the late 1990s, he diluted his stake in the Asian Age, eventually selling off a major part of it to the owners of the Deccan Chronicle Group.

In March 2008, Akbar was removed from &quot;The Asian Age&quot; and &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot; due to differences with the owners over editorial policy, as some newspapers have reported it.

Akbar launched the fortnightly political magazine &quot;Covert&quot; on 13 May 2008 in Delhi with the first issue on stands on 14 May. Simultaneously, the &quot;Covert&quot; website was launched two days later though it was ultimately discontinued.

Akbar launched a new Sunday newspaper from 31 January 2010, &quot;The Sunday Guardian&quot;, published from New Delhi and Chandigarh besides an edition called &quot;India on Sunday&quot; from London. He remained the Editor-in-Chief and then Editorial Director there until May 2014, when he resigned to join politics full-time.

In the meanwhile, in September 2010, he joined the Living Media as Editorial Director of the leading weekly English news magazine India Today and the English news channel Headlines Today. He left in October 2012.

== #MeToo controversy==
The controversy began when the journalist Priya Ramani writing an article at Vogue about sexual harassment in context of the &#x27;Me Too&#x27; Movement in India. She had written a general article on attitude of male bosses and recalled her own experience and decided to include it. At first, no name was given. However, a year later, Ramani decided to name MJ Akbar as the person she was referring to through Twitter. Other female colleagues before and after tweet had also accused Akbar of sexual harassment. He was accused of sexual harassment also by UK-based journalist Ruth David, CNN scribe Majlie de Puy Kamp, Saba Naqvi, journalist and author Ghazala Wahab, journalist Sutapa Paul, and journalist Suparna Sharma, amongst others.

On 14 October 2018, he made an official statement saying that he found the allegations against him as &quot;wild and baseless&quot; and that he planned to take legal recourse against the women who accused him. Akbar filed a criminal defamation case against Priya Ramani on 15 October 2018 with representation by Geeta Luthra. BBC reported Akbar&#x27;s response, &quot;In court, he denied the incident alleged by Ms Ramani - he said he had not asked her to meet him at his hotel, or that she called him from the hotel reception, or that he called her to his room.&quot; Regarding the accusations of other women, Akbar used Twitter to remark that such accusations were politically motivated.

However, the accusations are by a multitude of women, across time and locations. As of 17 October, the count of accusations stood at 20: all of the women signed a petition to the court where Akbar&#x27;s defamation case is to be heard, asking that they too, be heard. Following this, Akbar resigned from his post on 17 October 2018.

In an op-ed in Washington Post on 2 November 2018, Pallavi Gogoi, the chief business editor for NPR in the United States, wrote of her rape by Akbar 23 years ago in a hotel room in Jaipur. Gogoi was the editor of the op-ed page of the Asian Age at that time. In response, Akbar has admitted to a past relationship with Gogoi, and said it was consensual.

On 17 February 2021, he lost defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani who accused him of sexual harassment. The Delhi court said, &quot;a woman has right to voice her grievance even after several years&quot; on the judgement. MJ Akbar subsequently appealed to Delhi High Court. On 11 August 2021 the Delhi High Court issued a notice to journalist Priya Ramani based on the plea filed by MJ Akbar.

<doc id="616425" wikidata="Q2907318" url="?curid=616425" title="United States aircraft production during World War II">
<text>America&#x27;s manufacturers in World War II were engaged in the greatest military industrial effort in history. Aircraft companies went from building a handful of planes at a time to building them by the thousands on assembly lines. Aircraft manufacturing went from a distant 41st place among American industries to first place in less than five years.

In 1939, total aircraft production for the US military was less than 3,000 planes. By the end of the war, America produced 300,000 planes. No war was more industrialized than World War II. It was a war won as much by machine shops as by machine guns.

In January 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appealed to Congress for $300 million to be spent on procuring aircraft for the Army Air Corps. At the time the Corps had approximately 1,700 aircraft in total. Congress responded and authorized the procurement of 3,251 aircraft.

The American aircraft industry was given impetus at the early part of the war by the demand from the British and French for aircraft to supplement their own domestic production. The 1939 Neutrality Act permitted belligerents to acquire armaments from US manufacturers provided they paid in cash and used their own transportation - &quot;cash and carry&quot;. The British Purchasing Commission had been set up prior to the war to arrange purchase of aircraft and the British and French dealt directly with manufacturers paying from their financial reserves. After France fell to Germany, many of the orders for aircraft were taken over by the British. By 1940, the British had ordered $1,200,000,000 worth of aircraft. This led to some aircraft, such as the North American P-51 Mustang, being designed and produced to meet European requirements and then being adopted by the US. In their need for aircraft the Anglo-French commission also ordered designs from manufacturers that had failed to win US Army contracts - e.g. the Martin Model 167.

The American aircraft industry was able to adapt to the demands of war. In 1939 contracts assumed single-shift production, but as the number of trained workers increased, the factories moved to first two- and then a three-shift schedules. The government aided development of capacity and skills by placing &quot;Educational orders&quot; with manufacturers, and new government-built plants for the private firms to use.

Aircraft companies built other manufacturer&#x27;s designs; the B-17 Flying Fortress was built by Boeing (the designer), the Lockheed Corporation, and Douglas Aircraft. Automotive companies joined schemes to produce aircraft components and also complete aircraft. Ford set up the Willow Run production facility and built complete Consolidated B-24 Liberators as well as sections to be assembled at other plants.

William S. Knudsen, an automotive industry executive who was made Chairman of the Office of Production Management and member of the National Defense Advisory Commission by the Roosevelt administration to organize war production, said, &quot;We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.&quot;

<doc id="616436" wikidata="Q7194222" url="?curid=616436" title="Pillsbury Baptist Bible College">
<text>Pillsbury Baptist Bible College was an independent Baptist college in Owatonna, Minnesota, United States that operated from 1957 to 2008. Pillsbury described itself as a &quot;biblical arts college.&quot; It offered a four-year program leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Bible and Bachelor of Science in Bible, as well as several associate degrees and a Bible certificate program.

The campus was previously home to the Pillsbury Military Academy, Pillsbury Academy, and Minnesota Academy. In 1987 a historic district of five campus buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Pillsbury Academy Campus Historic District. It was nominated because of its local significance in architecture, education, and religion, because it was the only 19th-century Baptist institution of higher learning in Minnesota, and because of its association with benefactors Mark H. Dunnell and George A. Pillsbury.

==History==
The Minnesota Baptist State Convention opened the school as Minnesota Academy on September 10, 1877, as a college-preparatory school. The name was changed to Pillsbury Academy in 1886 in honor of one of its major donors, George A. Pillsbury, former mayor of Minneapolis and a member of the First Baptist Church of Minneapolis. In 1920 it was renamed the Pillsbury Military Academy. In 1957, after a dispute resulted in a change in Baptist Convention control from American Baptist to fundamentalist Minnesota Baptist, the Academy was abruptly closed and reconstituted as a 4-year biblical arts college, Pillsbury Baptist Bible College.

The older structures on campus were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 22, 1987, as the Pillsbury Academy Campus Historic District. The five contributing properties are Old Main (built 1889), Music Hall (1892), Jefts Hall (1910‚Äì11), Lindsay Hall (1913‚Äì14), and a heating plant (1893).

In February 2005, Pillsbury received accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). Pillsbury also had membership in the American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries.

Enrollment at the school had dropped from a high of about 800 in the years 1967-68 to 142 in its final semester.

Pillsbury announced in October 2008 that it would permanently close at the end of the year and that its campus would be sold. The college closed on December 31, 2008. Pillsbury&#x27;s transcripts are now held by Maranatha Baptist University in perpetuity.

In April 2014, the campus was purchased and revamped as a summer camp called Camp Pillsbury, which opened in June 2014. In addition to the camp programs that will be offered, a technical charter school operated by the Technical Academies of Minnesota will be housed on campus.

==Athletics==
Athletic teams were called the Comets. The school had football, baseball, wrestling, cross country, soccer, and basketball for men and volleyball, cross country, softball, cheerleading, and basketball for women. Pillsbury Baptist Bible college was an NCAA division III institution. It was a member of the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference until 1988. They were the men&#x27;s golf champions of their conference in 1995.

<text>Ignazio Francesco Giunti (; 30 August 1941 ‚Äì 10 January 1971) was an Italian racing driver. He competed in Formula One as well as in saloon and Sports Car Racing.

Giunti was born in Rome. In 1968, driving for Alfa Romeo, he finished second in the Targa Florio and fourth in the Le Mans 24 Hours race co-driving with Nanni Galli.

In 1970, Giunti was signed by Ferrari primarily for their sports-car team, and won the 12 Hours of Sebring as well as achieving several other high placings. His success earned him a Formula One chance along with Clay Regazzoni, who Ferrari was also trialling at the time. Giunti finished fourth on his debut in the Belgian GP at Spa. Despite his being out-performed by Regazzoni during the remaining races, he was re-signed by Ferrari for the following season.

Giunti was killed during his first drive in 1971 whilst racing in the 1000 km Buenos Aires. He was leading the race when his Ferrari 312PB prototype ploughed into the back of the Matra-Simca MS660 of Jean-Pierre Beltoise, who was pushing the car along the track after it had run out of fuel. He died due to the impact and the subsequent fire.

<text>The Minnesota Baptist Association, originally known as the Minnesota Baptist Convention, is an organization of independent fundamental Baptist churches in the state of Minnesota. The first meeting of the state convention of Minnesota Baptists was held August 28, 1859, in Winona. It was affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention, but was taken over by fundamentalists under the leadership of William Bell Riley and subsequently withdrew from the Northern Baptists because of what they felt was an increasing trend toward modernism among the leadership, colleges, etc.

<text>Pierre Buyoya (24 November 1949 ‚Äì 17 December 2020) was a Burundian army officer and politician who served two terms as President of Burundi in 1987 to 1993 and 1996 to 2003. He was the second-longest-serving president in Burundian history.

An ethnic Tutsi, Buyoya joined the sole legal party, UPRONA and quickly rose through the ranks of the Burundian military. In 1987, he led a military coup d&#x27;√©tat that overthrew his predecessor Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and enabled him to seize power. Leading an oppressive military junta, Hutu uprisings in 1988 led to the killings of an estimated 20,000 people. Buyoya then established a National Reconciliation Commission that created a new constitution in 1992 which allowed for a multi-party system and a non-ethnic government. Running as a candidate in the 1993 Burundian presidential election, he was defeated by Hutu candidate Melchior Ndadaye of the FRODEBU opposition party.

Ndadaye was assassinated during another attempted coup after only three months in office, leading to a series of retaliatory killings that culminated in the Burundian Civil War. During the war, Buyoya returned to power in another coup d&#x27;√©tat in 1996. During his second presidency, he created an ethnically inclusive government by establishing a partnership with FROBEDU. This led to the 2000 Arusha Accords which introduced ethnic power sharing. He selected Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu as his vice-president, who succeeded him as president in 2003. The war ended two years later.

Following the end of the war, Buyoya became a senator for life under the terms of the 2004 constitution. During his post-presidency, he was also sent as an African Union envoy during peace missions in Chad and Mali. In November 2020, he was sentenced to life in prison in absentia by a Burundinan court for his suspected role in the 1993 coup attempt that assassinated Ndadaye. He died of COVID-19 two months later.

==Early life==
Pierre Buyoya was born in Rutovu, Bururi Province, on 24 November 1949 in Belgian-administered Ruanda-Urundi. His father, Rurikumunwa, was ethnically a Tutsi-Hima of the Batyaba clan. He received a primary education at a Catholic mission in Rutovu from 1958 to 1963. He thereafter attended the Ecole moyenne p√©dagogique until 1967. He enlisted as an officer the Burundian Army and studied at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, Belgium, rising to the rank of major. Academically, Buyoya studied social sciences, examined armoured cavalry, and defended a thesis concerning the Algerian National Liberation Front. Once done with his studies in Belgium, he attended the General Staff College in France from August 1976 to January 1977 and the Bundeswehr Command and Staff College in West Germany from 1980 to 1982.

Buyoya married Sophie Ntaraka in 1978, and the couple had four children. He entered the long-term single party, Union for National Progress (&quot;Union pour le Progr√®s national&quot;, UPRONA), and acquired a position on its Central Committee (&quot;Comit√© central&quot;) in 1979. He renewed his party membership in 1984. Buyoya joined the General Staff of the Army in 1982 and was made responsible for training. His rapid rise through the military hierarchy earned him the nickname &quot;Old Man&quot;, and he was well-respected by his fellow soldiers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1996 that &quot;[n]o one could recall his ever telling a joke. He is often seen at soccer games and reads a lot. He eschews a uniform, though his leisure suits recall French summer khakis.&quot;

==Presidency==
===Coup d&#x27;√©tat and first term, 1987‚Äì1993===
In September 1987, Buyoya led a military coup d&#x27;√©tat against the regime of Jean-Baptiste Bagaza who had taken power in another coup in November 1976. He led the country as the chairman of a 31-person military committee of national safety. He proclaimed an agenda of economic liberalisation. As in previous regimes, he presided over an oppressive ruling junta consisting primarily of Tutsi. This led to a Hutu uprising in August 1988, which caused approximately 20,000 deaths. After these killings, Buyoya appointed a Commission of National Reconciliation (&quot;Commission pour la r√©conciliation nationale&quot;). On 9 September he was officially proclaimed President of Burundi. In early October he appointed a mixed government of both civilian and military figures and awarded himself the post of Minister of National Defence.

This commission created a new constitution that Buyoya approved in 1992. This constitution called for a non-ethnic government with a president and a parliament. Democratic presidential elections were held in June 1993 and were won by the Hutu Melchior Ndadaye, who created a balanced Hutu and Tutsi government. Nevertheless, the army assassinated Ndadaye in a coup attempt in October 1993. Some human rights groups suspected Buyoya of supporting the putschists, while several soldiers who participated accused him of helping plan the coup. Burundi entered a prolonged period of civil war in which 300,000 people were killed and 470,000 displaced. There were numerous attempts to form a government, but even the coalition government under Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was unable to stop the fighting.

===Coup d&#x27;√©tat and second term, 1996‚Äì2003===

On 25 July 1996, with strong support and backup from the army, Buyoya returned to power in a military coup, ousting interim President Ntibantunganya who had been contested by the population due to his failure to stop killings perpetrated by rebels. The civil war became less intense but continued. Economic sanctions were also imposed by the international community because of the nature of Buyoya&#x27;s return to power, but were eased as Buyoya created an ethnically inclusive government. He entered a new &quot;partnership&quot; with the National Assembly in June 1998 which was dominated by the Hutu-backed Front for Democracy in Burundi (&quot;Front pour la D√©mocratie au Burundi&quot;, FRODEBU). This paved the way for the Arusha Accords in 2000 which introduced a form of ethnic power-sharing and paved the way for the end of the Civil War. Buyoya selected as his vice-president Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu. The conditions of the Arusha Accords required Buyoya to hand over power in 2003, which he did. Ndayizeye became the President of Burundi on 30 April, paving the way for the end of the Civil War in 2005.

==Later activities==
In the aftermath of the Civil War, Buyoya became a senator for life as a former head of state, per the terms of the 2004 constitution.

In his 2007 book &quot;From Bloodshed to Hope in Burundi&quot;, the former US Ambassador Robert Krueger accuses Buyoya of orchestrating the 1993 putsch that led to the murder of President Ndadaye.

Buyoya was appointed by the African Union to lead a peace mission in Chad in 2008. He was subsequently appointed to another mission in Mali. On 19 October 2020 the Supreme Court of Burundi sentenced Buyoya in absentia to life in prison for the murder of Ndadaye in 1993.

In December 2020 he contracted COVID-19 in Mali during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mali. At first, he was hospitalised in Bamako but was later transferred to France and died on 17 December in Bonneuil-en-France, in an ambulance on his way to a hospital in Paris. He was buried in Bamako on 29 December 2020.

<doc id="616448" wikidata="Q206552" url="?curid=616448" title="Wilson loop">
<text>In quantum field theory, Wilson loops are gauge invariant operators arising from the parallel transport of gauge variables around closed loops. They encode all gauge information of the theory, allowing for the construction of loop representations which fully describe gauge theories in terms of these loops. In pure gauge theory they play the role of order operators for confinement, where they satisfy what is known as the area law. Originally formulated by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1974, they were used to construct links and plaquettes which are the fundamental parameters in lattice gauge theory. Wilson loops fall into the broader class of loop operators, with some other notable examples being &#x27;t Hooft loops, which are magnetic duals to Wilson loops, and Polyakov loops, which are the thermal version of Wilson loops.

==Definition==

To properly define Wilson loops in gauge theory requires considering the fiber bundle formulation of gauge theories. Here for each point in the formula_1-dimensional spacetime formula_2 there is a copy of the gauge group formula_3 forming what&#x27;s known as a fiber of the fiber bundle. These fiber bundles are called principal bundles. Locally the resulting space looks like formula_4 although globally it can have some twisted structure depending on how different fibers are glued together.

The issue that Wilson lines resolve is how to compare points on fibers at two different spacetime points. This is analogous to parallel transport in general relativity which compares tangent vectors that live in the tangent spaces at different points. For principal bundles there is a natural way to compare different fiber points through the introduction of a connection, which is equivalent to introducing a gauge field. This is because a connection is a way to separate out the tangent space of the principal bundle into two subspaces known as the vertical and horizontal subspaces. The former consists of all vectors pointing along the fiber formula_3 while the latter consists of vectors that are perpendicular to the fiber. This allows for the comparison of fiber values at different spacetime points by connecting them with curves in the principal bundle whose tangent vectors always live in the horizontal subspace, so the curve is always perpendicular to any given fiber.

If the starting fiber is at coordinate formula_6 with a starting point of the identity formula_7, then to see how this changes when moving to another spacetime coordinate formula_8, one needs to consider some spacetime curve formula_9 between formula_6 and formula_8. The corresponding curve in the principal bundle, known as the horizontal lift of formula_12, is the curve formula_13 such that formula_14 and that its tangent vectors always lie in the horizontal subspace. The fiber bundle formulation of gauge theory reveals that the Lie-algebra valued gauge field formula_15 is equivalent to the connection that defines the horizontal subspace, so this leads to a differential equation for the horizontal lift

:formula_16

This has a unique formal solution called the Wilson line between the two points

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the path-ordering operator, which is unnecessary for abelian theories. The horizontal lift starting at some initial fiber point other than the identity merely requires multiplication by the initial element of the original horizontal lift. More generally, it holds that if formula_19 then formula_20 for all formula_21.

Under a local gauge transformation formula_22 the Wilson line transforms as

:formula_23

This gauge transformation property is often used to directly introduce the Wilson line in the presence of matter fields formula_24 transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, where the Wilson line is an operator that makes the combination formula_25 gauge invariant. It allows for the comparison of the matter field at different points in a gauge invariant way. Alternatively, the Wilson lines can also be introduced by adding an infinitely heavy test particle charged under the gauge group. Its charge forms a quantized internal Hilbert space, which can be integrated out, yielding the Wilson line as the world-line of the test particle. This works in quantum field theory whether or not there actually is any matter content in the theory. However, the swampland conjecture known as the completeness conjecture claims that in a consistent theory of quantum gravity, every Wilson line and &#x27;t Hooft line of a particular charge consistent with the Dirac quantization condition must have a corresponding particle of that charge be present in the theory. Decoupling these particles by taking the infinite mass limit no longer works since this would form black holes.

The trace of closed Wilson lines is a gauge invariant quantity known as the Wilson loop

Mathematically the term within the trace is known as the holonomy, which describes a mapping of the fiber into itself upon horizontal lift along a closed loop. The set of all holonomies itself forms a group, which for principal bundles must be a subgroup of the gauge group. Wilson loops satisfy the reconstruction property where knowing the set of Wilson loops for all possible loops allows for the reconstruction of all gauge invariant information about the gauge connection. Formally the set of all Wilson loops forms an overcomplete basis of solutions to the Gauss&#x27; law constraint.

The set of all Wilson lines is in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of the gauge group. This can be reformulated in terms of Lie algebra language using the weight lattice of the gauge group formula_26. In this case the types of Wilson loops are in one-to-one correspondence with formula_27 where formula_28 is the Weyl group.

===Hilbert space operators===

An alternative view of Wilson loops is to consider them as operators acting on the Hilbert space of states in Minkowski signature. Since the Hilbert space lives on a single time slice, the only Wilson loops that can act as operators on this space are ones formed using spacelike loops. Such operators formula_29 create a closed loop of electric flux, which can be seen by noting that the electric field operator formula_30 is nonzero on the loop formula_31 but it vanishes everywhere else. Using Stokes theorem it follows that the spatial loop measures the magnetic flux through the loop.

==Order operator==

Since temporal Wilson lines correspond to the configuration created by infinitely heavy stationary quarks, Wilson loop associated with a rectangular loop formula_32 with two temporal components of length formula_33 and two spatial components of length formula_34, can be interpreted as a quark-antiquark pair at fixed separation. Over large times the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop projects out the state with the minimum energy, which is the potential formula_35 between the quarks. The excited states with energy formula_36 are exponentially suppressed with time and so the expectation value goes as

:formula_37

making the Wilson loop useful for calculating the potential between quark pairs. This potential must necessarily be a monotonically increasing and concave function of the quark separation. Since spacelike Wilson loops are not fundamentally different from the temporal ones, the quark potential is really directly related to the pure Yang‚ÄìMills theory structure and is a phenomenon independent of the matter content.

Elitzur&#x27;s theorem ensures that local non-gauge invariant operators cannot have a non-zero expectation values. Instead one must use non-local gauge invariant operators as order parameters for confinement. The Wilson loop is exactly such an order parameter in pure Yang‚ÄìMills theory, where in the confining phase its expectation value follows the area law

:formula_38

for a loop that encloses an area formula_39. This is motivated from the potential between infinitely heavy test quarks which in the confinement phase is expected to grow linearly formula_40 where formula_41 is known as the string tension. Meanwhile, in the Higgs phase the expectation value follows the perimeter law

:formula_42

where formula_43 is the perimeter length of the loop and formula_44 is some constant. The area law of Wilson loops can be used to demonstrate confinement in certain low dimensional theories directly, such as for the Schwinger model whose confinement is driven by instantons.

==Lattice formulation==

In lattice field theory, Wilson lines and loops play a fundamental role in formulating gauge fields on the lattice. The smallest Wilson lines on the lattice, those between two adjacent lattice points, are known as links, with a single link starting from a lattice point formula_45 going in the formula_46 direction denoted by formula_47. Four links around a single square are known as a plaquette, with their trace forming the smallest Wilson loop. It is these plaquettes that are used to construct the lattice gauge action known as the Wilson action. Larger Wilson loops are expressed as products of link variables along some loop formula_32, denoted by

:formula_49

These Wilson loops are used to study confinement and quark potentials numerically. Linear combinations of Wilson loops are also used as interpolating operators that give rise to glueball states. The glueball masses can then be extracted from the correlation function between these interpolators.

The lattice formulation of the Wilson loops also allows for an analytic demonstration of confinement in the strongly coupled phase, assuming the quenched approximation where quark loops are neglected. This is done by expanding out the Wilson action as a power series of traces of plaquettes, where the first non-vanishing term in the expectation value of the Wilson loop in an formula_50 gauge theory gives rise to an area law with a string tension of the form

:formula_51

where formula_52 is the inverse coupling constant and formula_53 is the lattice spacing. While this argument holds for both the abelian and non-abelian case, compact electrodynamics only exhibits confinement at strong coupling, with there being a phase transition to the Coulomb phase at formula_54, leaving the theory deconfined at weak coupling. Such a phase transition is not believed to exist for formula_55 gauge theories at zero temperature, instead they exhibit confinement at all values of the coupling constant.

==Properties==

===Makeenko‚ÄìMigdal loop equation===

Similarly to the functional derivative which acts on functions of functions, functions of loops admit two types of derivatives called the area derivative and the perimeter derivative. To define the former, consider a contour formula_32 and another contour formula_57 which is the same contour but with an extra small loop at formula_58 in the formula_46-formula_60 plane with area formula_61. Then the area derivative of the loop functional formula_62 is defined through the same idea as the usual derivative, as the normalized difference between the functional of the two loops

:formula_63

The perimeter derivative is similarly defined whereby now formula_64 is a slight deformation of the contour formula_32 which at position formula_58 has a small extruding loop of length formula_67 in the formula_46 direction and of zero area. The perimeter derivative formula_69 of the loop functional is then defined as

:formula_70

In the large N-limit, the Wilson loop vacuum expectation value satisfies a closed functional form equation called the Makeenko‚ÄìMigdal equation

:formula_71

Here formula_72 with formula_73 being a line that does not close from formula_58 to formula_75, with the two points however close to each other. The equation can also be written for finite formula_76, but in this case it does not factorize and instead leads to expectation values of products of Wilson loops, rather than the product of their expectation values. This gives rise to an infinite chain of coupled equations for different Wilson loop expectation values, analogous to the Schwinger‚ÄìDyson equations. The Makeenko‚ÄìMigdal equation has been solved exactly in two dimensional formula_77 theory.

===Mandelstam identities===

Gauge groups that admit fundamental representations in terms of formula_78 matrices have Wilson loops that satisfy a set of identities called the Mandelstam identities, with these identities reflecting the particular properties of the underlying gauge group. The identities apply to loops formed from two or more subloops, with formula_79 being a loop formed by first going around formula_80 and then going around formula_81.

The Mandelstam identity of the first kind states that formula_82, with this holding for any gauge group in any dimension. Mandelstam identities of the second kind are acquired by noting that in formula_76 dimensions, any object with formula_84 totally antisymmetric indices vanishes, meaning that formula_85. In the fundamental representation, the holonomies used to form the Wilson loops are formula_78 matrix representations of the gauge groups. Contracting formula_84 holonomies with the delta functions yields a set of identities between Wilson loops. These can be written in terms the objects formula_88 defined iteratively so that formula_89 and

:formula_90

In this notation the Mandelstam identities of the second kind are

:formula_91

For example, for a formula_92 gauge group this gives formula_93.

If the fundamental representation are matrices of unit determinant, then it also holds that formula_94. For example, applying this identity to formula_95 gives

:formula_96

Fundamental representations consisting of unitary matrices satisfy formula_97. Furthermore, while the equality formula_98 holds for all gauge groups in the fundamental representations, for unitary groups it moreover holds that formula_99.

===Renormalization===

Since Wilson loops are operators of the gauge fields, the regularization and renormalization of the underlying Yang‚ÄìMills theory fields and couplings does not prevent the Wilson loops from requiring additional renormalization corrections. In a renormalized Yang‚ÄìMills theory, the particular way that the Wilson loops get renormalized depends on the geometry of the loop under consideration. The main features are
* Smooth non-intersecting curve: This can only have linear divergences proportional to the contour which can be removed through multiplicative renormalization.
* Non-intersecting curve with cusps: Each cusp results in an additional local multiplicative renormalization factor formula_100 that depends on the cusp angle formula_101.
* Self-intersections: This leads to operator mixing between the Wilson loops associated with the full loop and the subloops.
* Lightlike segments: These give rise to additional logarithmic divergences.

==Additional applications==

===Scattering amplitudes===

Wilson loops play a role in the theory of scattering amplitudes where a set of dualities between them and special types of scattering amplitudes has been found. These have first been suggested at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence. For example, in formula_102 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory maximally helicity violating amplitudes factorize into a tree-level component and a loop level correction. This loop level correction does not depend on the helicities of the particles, but it was found to be dual to certain polygonal Wilson loops in the large formula_76 limit, up to finite terms. While this duality was initially only suggested in the maximum helicity violating case, there are arguments that it can be extended to all helicity configurations by defining appropriate supersymmetric generalizations of the Wilson loop.

===String theory compactifications===

In compactified theories, zero mode gauge field states that are locally pure gauge configurations but are globally inequivalent to the vacuum are parameterized by closed Wilson lines in the compact direction. The presence of these on a compactified open string theory is equivalent under T-duality to a theory with non-coincident D-branes, whose separations are determined by the Wilson lines. Wilson lines also play a role in orbifold compactifications where their presence leads to greater control of gauge symmetry breaking, giving a better handle on the final unbroken gauge group and also providing a mechanism for controlling the number of matter multiplets left after compactification. These properties make Wilson lines important in compactifications of superstring theories.

===Topological field theory===

In a topological field theory, the expectation value of Wilson loops does not change under smooth deformations of the loop since the field theory does not depend on the metric. For this reason, Wilson loops are key observables on in these theories and are used to calculate global properties of the manifold. In formula_104 dimensions they are closely related to knot theory with the expectation value of a product of loops depending only on the manifold structure and on how the loops are tied together. This led to the famous connection made by Edward Witten where he used Wilson loops in Chern‚ÄìSimons theory to relate their partition function to Jones polynomials of knot theory.

<text>Archippus (; Ancient Greek: ·ºåœÅœáŒπœÄœÄŒøœÇ, &quot;master of the horse&quot;) was an early Christian believer mentioned briefly in the New Testament epistles of Philemon and Colossians.

==Role in the New Testament==
In Paul&#x27;s letter to Philemon (), Archippus is named once alongside Philemon and Apphia as a host of the church, and a &quot;fellow soldier.&quot; In (ascribed to Paul), the church is instructed to tell Archippus to &quot;Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.&quot;

==Role in tradition==
According to the 4th century Apostolic Constitutions (7.46), Archippus was the first bishop of Laodicea in Phrygia (now part of Turkey). Another tradition states that he was one of the 72 disciples appointed by Jesus Christ in . The Roman Catholic Church observes a feast day for Saint Archippus on March 20. According to tradition, he was stoned to death.

== Veneration ==

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates Archippus on several days.

* January 4: Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles.
* February 19: The apostles Archippus and Philemon, and the martyr Apphia.
* November 22: The apostles Philemon and Archippus, the martyr Apphia, and Onesimus.

<text>Theaceae (), the tea family, is a family of flowering plants comprising shrubs and trees, including the economically important tea plant, and the ornamental camellias. It can be described as having from seven to 40 genera, depending on the source and the method of circumscription used. The family Ternstroemiaceae has been included within Theaceae; however, the APG III system of 2009 places it instead in Pentaphylacaceae. Most but not all species are native to China and East Asia.

== Family traits ==
Plants in this family are characterized by simple leaves that are alternate spiral to distichous, serrated, and usually glossy. Most of the genera have evergreen foliage, but &quot;Stewartia&quot; and &quot;Franklinia&quot; are deciduous. The toothed margins are generally associated with a characteristic Theoid leaf tooth, which is crowned by a glandular, deciduous tip. The flowers in this family are usually pink or white and large and showy, often with a strong scent. The calyx consists of five or more sepals, which are often persistent in the fruiting stage, and the corolla is five-merous, rarely numerous. Plants in Theaceae are multistaminate, usually with 20-100+ stamens either free or adnate to the base of the corolla, and are also distinctive because of the presence of pseudopollen. The pseudopollen is produced from connective cells, and has either rib-like or circular thickenings. The ovary is often hairy and narrows gradually into the style, which may be branched or cleft. The carpels are typically opposite from the petals, or the sepals in the case of &quot;Camellia&quot;. The fruits are loculicidal capsules, indehiscent baccate fruits or sometimes pome-like. The seeds are few and sometimes winged, or in some genera covered by fleshy tissue or unwinged and nude.

==Genera==
Eight genera are currently accepted:
*&quot;Apterosperma&quot; 
*&quot;Camellia&quot; , including &quot;Dankia&quot; , &quot;Piquetia&quot; (, &quot;Thea&quot; , &quot;Yunnanea&quot; 
*&quot;Franklinia&quot; 
*&quot;Gordonia&quot; , including &quot;Laplacea&quot;
* &quot;Polyspora&quot; 
*&quot;Pyrenaria&quot; , including &quot;Dubardella&quot; , &quot;Glyptocarpa&quot; , &quot;Parapyrenaria&quot; , &quot;Sinopyrenaria&quot; , &quot;Tutcheria&quot; 
*&quot;Schima&quot; 
*&quot;Stewartia&quot; , including &quot;Hartia&quot; 
The fossil &quot;Pentapetalum trifasciculandricus&quot;, about 91 million years old, may belong to the Theaceae or the Pentaphylacaceae.

== Distribution ==
Members of the family are found in Southeast Asia and Malesia, tropical South America and the Southeast United States. Three genera (&quot;Franklinia&quot;, &quot;Gordonia&quot; and &quot;Stewartia&quot;) have species native to the Southeast United States, with &quot;Franklinia&quot; being endemic there, and under some interpretations, also &quot;Gordonia&quot; with the Asian species formerly included in that genus being transferred to &quot;Polyspora&quot;.

== Biochemistry ==
There is distinctive chemistry within the family Theaceae. Sometimes, single crystals of calcium oxalate are present in Theaceous plants. Ellagic acid and common polyphenols including flavonols, flavones and proanthocyanins are widely distributed throughout the family. Gallic acid and catechins only occur in &quot;Camellia&quot; sect. &quot;Thea (C. sinensis, C. taliensis&quot; and &quot;C. irrawadiensis&quot;.) Caffeine and its precursors theobromine and theophylline are only found in sect. &quot;Thea&quot; and are not found in other species of &quot;Camellia&quot; or other Theaceae. Caffeine content in the tea bush makes up 2.5-4% of the leaf&#x27;s dry weight, and this high content of catechins and caffeine in the tea bush is the result of artificial selection by humans for these characters. Triterpenes and their glycosides (saponins) are found widely throughout the family in the seeds, leaves, wood and bark. Plants in this family are also known to accumulate aluminum and fluoride.

== Economic importance ==

The best known genus is &quot;Camellia&quot;, which includes the plant whose leaves are used to produce tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;). In parts of Asia, other species are used as a beverage, including &quot;C. taliensis, C. grandibractiata, C. kwangsiensis, C. gymnogyna, C. crassicolumna, C. tachangensis, C. ptilophylla&quot;, and &quot;C. irrawadiensis&quot;. Several species are grown widely as ornamentals for their flowers and handsome foliage.

<doc id="616463" wikidata="Q2456302" url="?curid=616463" title="Net Yaroze">
<text>The is a development kit for the PlayStation video game console. It was a promotion by Sony Computer Entertainment to computer programming hobbyists which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. It was originally called Net Yarouze, but was changed to Net Yaroze in late 1996. &quot;Yar≈çze&quot; means &quot;Let&#x27;s do it together&quot;.

Conceived by PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi and priced at around $750 US, the Net Yaroze (DTL-H300x) package contained a special black-colored debugging PlayStation unit, a serial cable for connecting the console to a personal computer, and a CD containing PlayStation development tools. The user has to provide a personal computer (an IBM PC compatible or Macintosh; NEC PC-9801 was also supported in Japan) to write the computer code, compile it, and send the program to the PlayStation.

The Net Yaroze was neither the first nor only official consumer console development kit. The PC-Engine Develo predates it, and the WonderWitch followed it. The GP32 can run user programs out of the box. Finally, many earlier consoles (Astrocade, Famicom) offered limited programming capabilities with BASIC dialects. Net Yaroze had no direct successors on subsequent PlayStation platforms, but Sony&#x27;s Linux for PlayStation 2 and YA-BASIC offered a similar feature to hobbyists and amateur developers on the PlayStation 2 console.

==Contents==

The Net Yaroze kit contains the following items:
*The Net Yaroze PlayStation console, which is identical to a standard PlayStation console except that it has different boot ROMs, lacks a regional lockout, uses a different encryption scheme, and is black.
*2 PlayStation controllers (black matte texture)
*The Net Yaroze key disc, required to boot programs which were loaded from a PC.
*The Access Card, a dongle which must be placed in memory card port 1 in order to boot programs which were loaded from a PC.
*A CD-ROM containing development tools. The tools included vary according to version, but invariably include a C compiler, a compiler assembler, a linker, a debugger, tools for converting graphic and sound files to PlayStation format, and programming libraries.
*The Communications Cable, a special serial cable used to link the console and the computer.
*&quot;Start Up Guide&quot;, &quot;Library Reference&quot;, and &quot;User&#x27;s Guide&quot; manuals. These document the programming libraries and PlayStation-specific development, but do not give instructions on how to program; the Net Yaroze kit assumes the user has basic programming knowledge.

==Versions==
Though it lacked regional lockout, the Net Yaroze console exists in three variations: one for Japan, one for North America and one for Europe and Australia. The Europe/Australia version boots in PAL mode, while the others boot in NTSC mode. There are further differences between the Japanese kit and the others; the manuals are in Japanese, the software for Japanese PCs is included, and the discs and access card sticker have different printing. The Japanese version is sometimes unofficially referred to as DTL-3000 rather than DTL-H3000.

The Net Yaroze was only available for purchase by mail order; but Sony also provided it to universities in the UK, France (EPITA), and Japan.

Additionally, a version of CodeWarrior for PlayStation was released for both Windows and Macintosh in October 1996. LightWave 3D was another consumer-level PlayStation development tool.

The Net Yaroze lacks many of the features the official PlayStation Software Developers Kit provided, such as advanced hardware debugging, special software, certain libraries, and Sony&#x27;s extensive technical support (including BBS and live telephone support). Dedicated Usenet groups, with access restricted to Net Yaroze members, were maintained by Sony; homepage hosting was also provided. The access was restricted according to the kit&#x27;s region of origin, which made collaboration between users in different territories impractical.

The Yaroze&#x27;s primary RAM was the same as the consumer&#x27;s model (2 megabytes). Game code, graphics, audio samples and run-time libraries were limited to fit in the 2¬†MB of primary RAM, 1¬†MB of VRAM, and 0.5¬†MB of sound RAM, since the Net Yaroze will not play user-burned CDs, a necessary restriction in order to prevent piracy and ensure that the Yaroze program would not compete with the PlayStation&#x27;s professional software development kit. This however, was not a problem for licensed developers who owned the official SDK. There are many commercial PlayStation titles (such as &quot;Devil Dice&quot;, long mistaken as a Net Yaroze game) that can be entirely RAM-resident, and have been developed with the Net Yaroze, while using the CD strictly to spool Red Book audio (CD-DA).

==Games produced==
Sony set up an online forum where users could share their homemade games, swap programming tips, and ask questions to Sony technical support staff. Many games made by hobbyists on the Net Yaroze were released on various demo discs that came along with the &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; (as well as other official PlayStation magazines in PAL regions) from 1997 to 2004. The last &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; issue, number 108, featured a compilation with many Net Yaroze games. A promotional disc, limited to a thousand copies and featuring a number of user-developed games, was produced by SCEE and sent to PAL-zone Yaroze owners. This disc can only be played on a Net Yaroze since it requires the access card included with the system to work.

Some of these games were based on arcade classics such as &quot;Mr. Do&quot; and &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;, while others (e.g. &quot;Time Slip&quot;) were illustrations of a novel concept. The Game Developer UK Competition, organized by Scottish Enterprise in collaboration with the Scottish Games Alliance, Sony and &quot;Edge&quot; in 1998, accepted Net Yaroze entries; the overall winner was Chris Chadwick for his game &quot;Blitter Boy ‚Äì Operation: Monster Mall&quot;. An updated version of &quot;Time Slip&quot; was later released for Xbox Live Arcade in February 2011 and Windows in January 2012. Some of the system&#x27;s developers moved into the games industry; &quot;Fatal Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; developer Mitsuru Kamiyama became director of the &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; series at Square Enix. &quot;Magic Castle&quot; by Kaiga was pitched to various publishers but went unreleased until it was distributed online in 2021 by one of the original staff members.

In Turkish, &quot;Alp&quot; means &quot;Stouthearted&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Chivalrous&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and/or &quot;Valorous&quot;. The second, &quot;er&quot; means soldier or male. Additionally &quot;Alper&quot; is used as an adjective for an ancient legendary Turkish commander; Alp Er Tunga who lived around 300 B.C.
It&#x27;s meant to be a good hearted one too.
From the same Asian cultural roots, Alper is closely related to the name ÂãáÂ£´ (Japanese &quot;yuushi&quot;, Chinese &quot;y«íngsh√¨&quot;) derived Âãá =Alp and Â£´ =Er words.

<doc id="616482" wikidata="Q6492" url="?curid=616482" title="Airbus A330 MRTT">
<text>The Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) is a European aerial refueling and military transport aircraft based on the civilian Airbus A330. A total of 15 countries have placed firm orders for approximately 82 aircraft, of which 62 had been delivered by 31 January 2025. A version of the A330 MRTT, the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45, was selected by the United States Air Force for its aerial tanker replacement programme, but the programme was cancelled.

==Design and development==

The Airbus A330 MRTT is a military derivative of the A330-200 airliner. It is designed as a dual-role air-to-air refuelling and transport aircraft. For air-to-air refuelling missions, the A330 MRTT can be equipped with a combination of any of the following systems:
* Refuelling other aircraft
** Airbus Military Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) for receptacle-equipped receiver aircraft.
** Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods for probe-equipped receiver aircraft.
** Cobham 805E Fuselage Refuelling Unit (FRU) for probe-equipped receiver aircraft
* Being refuelled
** Universal Aerial Refuelling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) for self in-flight refuelling.

The A330 MRTT has a maximum fuel capacity of without the use of additional fuel tanks, leaving space for of additional cargo. The A330 MRTT&#x27;s wing has common structure with the four-engine A340-200/-300 with reinforced mounting locations and provision for fuel piping for the A340&#x27;s outboard engines. The A330 MRTT&#x27;s wing therefore requires little modification to use these hardpoints for the wing refuelling pods.

The A330 MRTT cabin can be modified to carry up to 380 passengers in a single-class configuration, allowing a complete range of configurations from maximised troop transport to complex customisation suitable for VIP and guest missions. Available configurations include 300 passengers in a single class and 266 passengers in two classes. The A330 MRTT can also be configured to perform Medical Evacuation (Medevac) missions; up to 130 standard stretchers can be carried. The main deck cargo configuration allows carriage of standard commercial containers and pallets, military, ISO and NATO pallets (including seats) and containers, and military equipment and other large items which are loaded through a cargo door. Like the A330-200, the A330 MRTT includes two lower deck cargo compartments (forward and aft) and a bulk area capability. The cargo hold has been modified to be able to transport up to eight military pallets in addition to civilian unit load devices (ULDs).

An optional crew rest compartment (CRC) can be installed in the forward cabin, accommodating a spare crew to increase time available for a mission. The passenger cabin of the A330 MRTT can be provided with a set of removable airstairs to enable embarkation and disembarkation when jet bridges or ground support equipment are not available.

Standard commercial A330-200s are delivered from Airbus&#x27;s Final Assembly Line in Toulouse, France to the Airbus Military Conversion Centre in Getafe, Spain for fitting of refuelling systems and military avionics. The tanker was certified by Spanish authorities in October 2010. The first delivered aircraft (the third to be converted) arrived in Australia on 30 May 2011 and was formally handed over to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) two days later on 1 June.

On 30 September 2016, Airbus Defence and Space completed the first flight of the &quot;new standard&quot; A330 MRTT. The new standard features structural modifications, aerodynamic improvements for a 1% fuel-burn reduction, upgraded avionics computers, and enhanced military systems. The first delivery was planned for 2018.

An Airbus/Saab team proposed an A330-based Airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) (&quot;AWACS&quot;) variant with Saab&#x27;s Erieye radar to the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence in 2018 for the replacement of its Boeing E-3 Sentry fleet.

The boom operators sit at a video console using the Boom Enhanced Vision System. It uses a 3D camera vision system for day and night vision and ergonomics are significantly improved compared to operating in a prone position.

===A330 MRTT+===
In November 2023, Airbus began derisking studies for an updated MRTT based on the A330neo, noting that A330-200 production ended in 2018 and very few airframes remain available for MRTT use. In particular, the company is studying the feasibility of fitting the pods for the probe-and-drogue refuelling system onto the A330neo&#x27;s new wing.

The new variant, dubbed MRTT+, was announced at the 2024 Farnborough Air Show. Based on the A330-800, and powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the MRTT+ achieves 8% better fuel efficiency than the original MRTT.

==Operational history==
The A330 MRTT has been ordered by Australia, France, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Canada, and by NATO in a multi-nation deal. Australia was the launch customer for the A330 MRTT.

===Australia===

Designated as KC-30A, the RAAF A330 MRTTs are equipped with both an Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods. They are powered by two General Electric CF6-80E1A3 engines and are configured to carry up to 270 passengers plus 34,000 kilograms of cargo. Australia initially arranged to procure four MRTTs with an option to obtain a fifth; this option for a fifth was exercised to allow for two simultaneous deployments of two aircraft, the fifth being for contingency coverage. Australian KC-30As are operated by No. 33 Squadron RAAF, based at RAAF Base Amberley near Brisbane in Queensland.

In 2005, the RAAF expected deliveries to begin in 2008 and end in 2010. Deliveries fell two years behind schedule, partly due to boom development issues. On 30 May 2011, KC-30A RAAF serial A39-003, the third converted A330, arrived at RAAF Base Amberley and was formally handed over on 1 June 2011, thus becoming the first MRTT to be delivered to an end user. The second, A39-002, was handed over on 22 June 2011. On 3 December 2012, the fifth KC-30A was delivered to the RAAF. While the first conversion was performed in Spain, Qantas Defence Services converted the other four RAAF A330-200s at its Brisbane airport facility on behalf of EADS. In July 2013, there were reportedly delays to the KC-30A&#x27;s full service entry due to refuelling issues, such as the hose-and-drogue system passing too much fuel.

In August 2013, the KC-30A made its debut as a VIP transport, ferrying Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and an entourage to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. In August 2014, Defence Minister David Johnston announced the country&#x27;s intention to buy two more KC-30As, one with a VIP layout for the Prime Minister&#x27;s use. In July 2015, Defence Minister Kevin Andrews announced the order of two additional KC-30s, to be converted from A330-200s previously operated by Qantas, for delivery in 2018. In 2016, the decision was made to add a modest VIP fitout, including seating, meeting spaces and communication facilities, to a single KC-30A, which remains primarily used as a tanker. The 2016 Defence White Paper noted a possible rise in the fleet&#x27;s size, to nine, to support new RAAF aircraft such as the Boeing P-8A Poseidon.

On 22 September 2014, the RAAF deployed an Air Task Group, including F/A-18F Super Hornets, a KC-30A and a Boeing E-7A Wedgetail AEW&amp;C aircraft, to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as part of a coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The KC-30A started operations days after arriving in the UAE, refuelling coalition aircraft over Iraq. On 6 October 2014, the RAAF conducted its first combat missions over Iraq via two Super Hornets, supported by the KC-30A.

In December 2016, an RAAF KC-30A conducted air-to-air refuelling trials with a USAF B-1B bomber.

The &quot;Australian Defence Magazine&quot; reported in July 2023 that the Australian Government was expected to announce an order for two additional KC-30As to increase the RAAF&#x27;s fleet of the type to nine.

===United Kingdom===
In January 2004, the UK Ministry of Defence announced the selection of an A330 MRTT variant to provide tanking for the RAF for the next 30 years under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) programme, replacing the RAF&#x27;s TriStar and VC10 tankers. The Ministry of Defence entered negotiations with the EADS-led AirTanker consortium. On 27 March 2008, a deal was signed to lease 14 MRTTs under a private finance initiative arrangement with AirTanker, with the first to enter service in 2011. The service&#x27;s annual cost, including military personnel costs is around ¬£450 million for a delivery of 18,000 flying hours a rate of approximately ¬£25,000 per hour. There are two versions, designated &quot;Voyager KC.Mk 2&quot; and &quot;Voyager KC.Mk 3&quot;; the former is fitted with two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods, the latter with a Cobham 805E Fuselage Refuelling Unit (FRU) in addition to the under-wing pods; none are fitted with the Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS). All Voyagers are powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 engines.
By May 2014, nine aircraft had been delivered, completing the core fleet. Further deliveries were for a &quot;surge capability&quot;, available to the RAF when needed, but otherwise available to AirTanker for &quot;release to the civil market, less its military equipment or to partner nations in a military capacity with the MoD&#x27;s agreement&quot;. By 14 March 2016, all 14 Voyagers had been delivered. In November 2015, it was announced that a Voyager would be refitted to carry government ministers and members of the Royal Family on official visits. The refit cost ¬£10m but was claimed to save roughly ¬£775,000 annually compared to charter flights. ZZ336 is fitted with 158 seats (100 standard seats at the rear and 58 VIP seats at the front) and is known as Vespina. It entered service on 6 May 2016, the then Prime Minister David Cameron made his first flight on it to attend the 2016 Warsaw NATO summit. In June 2020, ZZ336 received a new livery based on the colours of the Union Flag at the request of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Although undertaken as a part of routine maintenance, the new livery&#x27;s cost was stated to be approximately ¬£900,000.
Because the RAF&#x27;s Voyagers are only capable of probe-and-drogue refuelling, they are unable to refuel current or future RAF aircraft that are fitted solely for flying boom refuelling, including the Boeing RC-135, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C and Boeing P-8 Poseidon. In April 2016, the RAF stated its interest in fitting a boom to some Voyagers, bringing its fleet into line with other MRTT operators. Fitting a boom would add flexibility to the RAF Voyagers, not only allowing operation with those types in the RAF not fitted for probe and drogue but for other air forces that operate boom-refuelled aircraft.

On 18 November 2022, an RAF Voyager completed the world-first 100% sustainable fuel military transporter flight; part of the RAF&#x27;s plan to become net-zero by 2040.

===United Arab Emirates===

In 2007, the United Arab Emirates announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus to purchase three A330 MRTTs. A contract was signed with the UAE in February 2008. The first UAE A330 MRTT was delivered on 6 February 2013. The remaining two were delivered by 6 August 2013. The UAE tankers are equipped with both an ARBS and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods; these ARBS units include a secondary boom hoist developed for the UAE. This system permits the boom to be retracted, even in the event of a primary boom retraction system failure. The UAE tankers are fitted with Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines. On 14 November 2021, UAE ordered two additional MRTTs.

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia finalised an agreement to purchase three A330 MRTTs equipped with both an Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods on 3 January 2008. In July 2009, it was announced that Saudi Arabia ordered three additional MRTTs. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) chose General Electric CF6-80 engines to power its A330 MRTTs.

On 25 February 2013, the first Saudi MRTT entered operational use. Three more MRTTs were ordered in a follow-on contract; delivery was expected in late 2014. By 31 August 2013, three had been delivered.

On 10 July 2024, four more MRTTS were ordered.

===Singapore===

In February 2012, Singapore expressed interest in the A330 MRTT to replace its four Boeing KC-135s. In February 2014, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) selected the MRTT over the Boeing KC-46, signing for six aircraft. All are fitted with Trent 772B engines and configured for a maximum capacity of 266 passengers or of cargo, as well as a maximum fuel weight of .

The first MRTT arrived in Singapore on 14 August 2018 in a special livery. It made its first public appearance at the RSAF&#x27;s 50th anniversary parade on 1 September 2018. The RSAF&#x27;s six MRTTs attained full operational capability (FOC) on 20 April 2021 and currently fly with the 112 Squadron at Changi Air Base (East) in Singapore.

===South Korea===
On 30 June 2015, South Korea selected the A330 MRTT; the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) planned to induct four aerial refueling tankers by 2020. The first MRTT was delivered on 12 November 2018, after a ferry flight from Airbus&#x27;s final assembly line in Getafe, Spain to South Korea, piloted by a joint Airbus and ROKAF crew. South Korea received its second MRTT in March 2019 and the third in July 2019. These aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.

The aircraft is designated &quot;KC-330 Cygnus&quot; (ko). The ROKAF held a contest among their service members and chose the name &#x27;Cygnus&#x27; after holding a deliberation committee session in November 2018 - January 2019. A few years later, one of the winners&#x27; confession revealed that he thought of the name Empress Cygnus, a character in the online game MapleStory. However, the condition of the contest was that only names related to space or birds (excluding birds of prey) would be accepted, but since the name of MapleStory&#x27;s Cygnus is taken from the constellation Cygnus, which means swan in Latin, that claim has merit.

It extends the endurance of ROKAF aircraft over remote areas such as Dokdo, Ieodo, and the North Pyongyang-Wonsan Line, as well as increase its ability to deploy overseas for international operations.

It is not only aerial refueling, but also serves as a transport aircraft for the deployment of personnel, such as repatriation of remains from the Korean War, replacement of overseas troops, transfer of South Korean Iraqi residents due to COVID-19, transportation of Janssen vaccines, participated in Operation Oasis, which transfer of Cheonghae Unit members of the &quot;Munmu the Great&quot; when they contracted COVID-19, repatriation of General Hong Beom-do&#x27;s remains and return to South Korea, participated in Operation Miracle, which transported cooperative Afghans, sent to import Diesel exhaust fluid from Australia to ease a supply shortage of the key material used in diesel vehicles, sent relief supplies and personnel to Turkey when the Turkey‚ÄìSyria earthquake occurred, supported Operation Promise, which allowed Koreans to escape when the Sudanese war broke out, and helped fight Canadian wildfires so Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a surprise visit to thank them for this, and the transportation of South Korean residents and travelers, 51 Japanese, and 6 Singaporeans in Israel due to the Israel-Hamas war.

===France===
In November 2011, France expressed interest in acquiring 14 A330 MRTTs to replace its Boeing KC-135 tankers and Airbus A340 and A310 transports; one year later, it was announced that 14 would be ordered in 2013. In May 2013, Airbus made an offer for 12 to 14 A330 MRTTs to France. On 20 February 2014, the French Chief of Staff stated that 12 A330 MRTTs would be acquired in two batches, an initial standard configuration with a boom and wing refuelling pods and later with a cargo door and SATCOM. On 15 December 2015, France ordered eight MRTTs, constituting the second tranche of a multi-year contract for 12 MRTTs, worth ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.3 billion), signed by the French Ministry of Defence in November 2014. Initial deliveries were expected in 2018, with further handovers of one or two per year until 2025.

In September 2018, the &quot;Direction g√©n√©rale de l&#x27;armement&quot; (DGA) announced plans to speed up delivery of the MRTT Ph√©nix, as it is known in French service, by two years, planning for the last of 12 aircraft to be delivered in 2023 rather than 2025. In addition, the DGA stated that the fleet would be later increased to 15 aircraft. Later in September, the French Air Force received the first MRTT as per the existing timetable. On 13 December 2018, France ordered another three MRTTs of a third tranche of the multi-year contract; these are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines and equipped with the ARBS and underwing hose-and-drogue refuelling pods.

=== Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet ===

In November 2011, the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board and European Defence Ministers endorsed air-to-air refueling (AAR) as one of the initial Pooling and Sharing initiatives after recognising the need for a greater AAR capability as it was heavily reliant on US Air Force tankers. In November 2012, the Ministers of Defence of 10 EDA member states (the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Norway) signed a letter of intent to jointly procure a multi-role tanker transport. The Netherlands was designated leader of the newly launched Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) project, which had the aim of creating an initial European AAR capability by 2020. In 2013, the Netherlands expressed interest in the A330 MRTT to replace its two KDC-10 aircraft; a study was launched on standardising European AAR capability in cooperation with other MFF members.

In December 2014, following a request for information, the bulk of the MMF member states entered negotiations with Airbus to procure a MRTT fleet to be owned by NATO while the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) and the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) would support the procurement process. This was accompanied by a request for proposals sent by OCCAR to Airbus for two MRTTs with options for six more; only the Netherlands and Luxembourg were full MMF members at this point. It was decided to base these MRTTs at Eindhoven Air Base, which has noise clearance to operate up to eight MRTTs. In July 2016, the Netherlands and Luxembourg jointly ordered the first two MRTTs under the MMF programme, the first scheduled for delivery by 2020. In June 2017, Germany and Norway became MMF members, pledging to order five more MRTTs plus options for a further four. On 26 September 2017, Airbus announced receipt of OCCAR&#x27;s firm order for five additional MRTTs.

The Belgian Ministry of Defence stated the intent to buy one MRTT in a 2015 defence plan. The Belgian government investigated the ‚Ç¨840 million plan, as well as the option of equipping Belgium&#x27;s seven A400Ms with under-wing pods; a combined Belgian A330 MRTT and A400M fleet would cost up to ‚Ç¨1 billion. On 22 December 2017, Belgium signed a contract for one MRTT, to be based at Eindhoven Air Base, bringing the MMF to eight aircraft. and officially joined the programme on 14 February 2018.

On 19 December 2017, NATO partnered with Israel&#x27;s Elbit Systems to provide J-Music electronic countermeasures systems to the fleet. Having considered joining the initiative for some time, the Czech Republic joined as the sixth member during October 2019. In September 2020, Luxembourg committed to an extra 1,000 hours and to provide funding for a ninth MRTT via an existing contract option.

As of 2018, Sweden was reportedly considering joining the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet programme.

Out of the total of ten aircraft currently on order, six will be based at Eindhoven Air Base in the Netherlands and four at Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany. On 30 June 2020, Airbus delivered the first MRTT. Aircraft six and seven were delivered on 26 and 28 July 2022 respectively. On 23 March 2023, the MMF was declared Initial Operational Capable during a ceremony at Eindhoven Air Base. Additionally, Belgium announced a ‚Ç¨265 million increase in the program&#x27;s funding, after which a MoU contract was signed for a tenth MRTT by the Ministers of Defence of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Norway. Then the NSPA formally ordered an additional MRTT, increasing the MMF to 10 aircraft.

The Netherlands government organised multiple flights with the multinational pool planes in transport configuration to repatriate Dutch nationals from Israel after the initial attacks of the 2023 Israel‚ÄìHamas war disrupted commercial air traffic to Israel.

In the Danish Defense Planning published in 2023, the intention to join the MRTT initiative was mentioned by the Royal Danish Air Force.

===Spain===

Spain&#x27;s Ministry of Defence stated that it was to acquire two A330 MRTT in 2016 to replace its ageing Boeing 707 tankers. In 2014, Spain&#x27;s Secretary of State for Defence stated that negotiations had begun with Airbus about switching its excess order for 13 Airbus A400Ms to an undisclosed number of MRTTs. The Airbus Defence and Space commercial director said that although it was a difficult issue, the company would negotiate with Spain to reach an agreement. In September 2020, Spain agreed to buy from Iberia three A330s no longer needed due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, then modify them to serve as a MRTT fleet. On 12 November 2021, Spain signed an order for three MRTTs from Airbus.

Between 2021 and 2022, the first two aircraft entered service in original passenger configuration, the third aircraft was sent directly to the conversion facility at Airbus Getafe. The first A330 MRTT is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2024, while the other two are delayed for conversion and delivery until 2025 and 2026 so that there will always be two aircraft in service. Beginning in January 2024, the first MRTT aircraft performed test flights.

===Brazil===
On 28 January 2021, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced negotiations for two A330 MRTT for the Brazilian Air Force. On 13 May 2021, the Ministry of Defence released a statement authorizing the deal, reportedly from the RAF&#x27;s active inventory. On 30 June 2021, the British military attach√© for Brazil, Royal Navy Captain Mark Albon, confirmed the ongoing negotiations, conducted by the UK ambassador to Brazil and Ministry of Defence officials. On 27 January 2022, the Brazilian Air Force ended negotiations with the RAF and launched international bidding to buy two A330-200s on the civil market, estimated at US$81 million.

On 6 April 2022, Azul Brazilian Airlines was declared the supplier by the Ministry of Defence. The agreements with Airbus, conversion costs and delivery schedule were kept confidential. Conversion work into A330 MRTTs is to be carried out at Airbus&#x27;s plant in Getafe, Spain. The aircraft are to be fitted with two Cobham 905E under-wing pods and a Cobham FRU-805E fuselage refuelling unit, and based at the Gale√£o Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro. VIP transport is also a possibility, in order to replace the Airbus A319ACJ in presidential trips requiring intercontinental range. Both airplanes were designated C-330 prior to the tanker conversions; upon completion of the conversions, they will be redesignated KC-30.

===Canada===

In April 2021, Airbus was declared the only qualified supplier to replace Canada&#x27;s RCAF CC-150 Polaris refuelling and VIP transport aircraft, beating out Boeing&#x27;s KC-46 Pegasus. In July 2022, a $102M deal was finalised to acquire two used A330-200s from the International Air finance Corporation for passenger/cargo-only use expected to be converted into MRTTs by Airbus in the future; it was anticipated that up to four more MRTTs would be acquired, for a total of six aircraft. This total was revised in July 2023 to nine, with the fleet being made up of five conversions and four newly manufactured MRTTs in a contract worth C$3.6 billion. The A330 MRTTs are designated CC-330 Husky by the RCAF, and the first passenger/cargo-only aircraft was delivered on 31 August 2023 in Ottawa.

===Potential operators===

====Indonesia====
In January 2018, Indonesian Air Force (TNI-AU) officials were reportedly studying both the A330 MRTT and Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tankers for a future modernisation programme, expected to take place after completion of the Airbus A400M Atlas programme. The TNI-AU was said to compare compatibility with its current aircraft; life-cycle costs; interoperability with current and future assets; and potential funding and technology transfer options with state-owned aircraft manufacturer Indonesian Aerospace. On September 5, 2023, the Indonesian Ministry of Defense stated that a number of defense equipment made by Airbus are in effective contract including the Airbus A330 MRTT.

====India====
The A330 MRTT and Ilyushin Il-78 competed for a tender floated in 2006 by the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) for six refuellers to extend the Indian Air Force&#x27;s (IAF) operating radius. In May 2009, India chose the MRTT over the Il-78. However, in January 2010, the government cancelled the order, citing high cost as the reason, reportedly against the IAF&#x27;s wishes. After rebidding, India selected Airbus as its &quot;preferred vendor&quot; in November 2012. In January 2013, India reportedly chose the MRTT as the &quot;preferred bid&quot;. In 2016, Airbus said India&#x27;s MoD had terminated the six-year-old US$2 billion tender for six MRTTs.

In January 2018, the IAF re-launched its aerial refuelling procurement programme, sending out a request for information (RFI) to Airbus, Boeing and Ilyushin. Both Airbus and Boeing responded to the RFI, while Ilyushin was disqualified as the requirement sought an aircraft with two turbofan engines. In 2017, India announced plans to purchase six airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) (&quot;AWACS&quot;) aircraft that can also perform aerial refuelling, with the first two AEW&amp;C aircraft awaiting approval by Cabinet in 2020. However, in September 2021, it was decided to use six Airbus A321s acquired from Air India instead.

====United States====
A consortium of Lockheed Martin and Airbus was proposing a variant called &quot;LMXT&quot; for the Bridge Tanker Competition referred to as KC-Y, which could lead to a contract to build up to 160 aircraft.

In October 2023, Lockheed Martin withdrew, leaving Airbus to make the bid alone.

====Others====
On 27 March 2014, Airbus announced that the Qatar Emiri Air Force intended to purchase two A330 MRTTs.

In May 2021, it was revealed that Egypt was considering the purchase of two A330 MRTTs as part of a Rafale fighter deal with France.

After cancelling the purchase of the KC-46, Italy in August 2024 launched a tender to procure of six tankers with a budget of ‚Ç¨1.4 billion.

===Failed bids===
====United States====
The US Air Force (USAF) ran a procurement programme to replace around 100 of its oldest KC-135E Stratotankers, i.e., initially excluding the more common updated KC-135R variant. EADS offered the A330 MRTT. The Boeing KC-767 was selected in 2002; however the USAF cancelled the KC-767 order upon the uncovering of illegal manipulation and corrupt practices during the competition.

In 2006, the USAF released a new request for proposal (RFP) for a tanker aircraft, which was updated in January 2007, to the KC-X RFP, one of three acquisition programmes that are intended to replace the entire KC-135 fleet. The A330 MRTT was proposed again by EADS and Northrop Grumman as the &quot;KC-30&quot;. It again competed against the Boeing KC-767, a smaller and less expensive aircraft with less fuel and cargo capability. Northrop Grumman and EADS announced plans to assemble the aircraft at a new facility in Mobile, Alabama, which would also build A330 freighters. On 29 February 2008, the USAF announced the selection of the KC-30 as the KC-135 replacement, and was designated KC-45A. On 18 June 2008, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld a protest by Boeing on the contract&#x27;s award to Northrop Grumman and EADS over process improprieties. This left the status of the KC-45A in doubt, because the GAO decision required the USAF to rebid the contract.

On 24 September 2009, the USAF began the first steps in the new round of bids, with a clearer set of criteria. On 8 March 2010, Northrop Grumman withdrew from the bidding process, asserting that the new criteria were skewed in favour of Boeing&#x27;s offering. On 20 April 2010, EADS announced it was re-entering the competition on a stand-alone basis and intended to enter a bid with the KC-45, still intending for Mobile to be the final assembly site. On 24 February 2011, the USAF announced that the development contract had been awarded to Boeing. William J. Lynn III, the deputy defence secretary, said Boeing was &quot;the clear winner&quot; under a formula that considered the bid prices, how well each tanker met needs and the operating costs over 40 years.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 19 January 2011, an air refuelling accident occurred between a boom-equipped A330 MRTT and a Portuguese Air Force General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Portugal. Early reports indicated that the boom broke off at the aft end of the boom near the F-16&#x27;s receptacle, causing the boom to recoil into the MRTT&#x27;s underside. The boom then became uncontrollable and oscillated until it broke off the boom assembly at the pivot point. Both aircraft were damaged but landed safely. The A330 MRTT involved was an Airbus test aircraft destined for the RAAF, operated by an Airbus crew. At the time of the incident, Airbus had not yet begun deliveries.

On 10 September 2012, an A330 MRTT&#x27;s refuelling boom detached in flight at an altitude of in Spanish airspace. The boom separated cleanly at a mechanical joint and fell to the ground, while the tanker landed safely in Getafe without any injuries. The fault was attributed to a conflict between the backup boom hoist (fitted to the UAE-destined MRTTs) and the primary boom retraction mechanism, as well as to the test conducted. Airbus later explained that the malfunction was not possible under ordinary operating conditions, and that procedures had been implemented to avoid similar incidents in the future. Following the incident, the &quot;Instituto Nacional de T√©cnica Aeroespacial&quot;, Spain&#x27;s airworthiness authority, issued precautionary restrictions to other users of boom-equipped A330s.

On 9 February 2014, a Royal Air Force A330 MRTT Voyager carrying 189 passengers and 9 crew from RAF Brize Norton to Camp Bastion suddenly lost of altitude in 27 seconds and reaching a maximum descent rate of while the co-pilot was out of the cockpit. The sudden descent caused several injuries to passengers and crew, some of whom struck the ceiling of the aircraft. The co-pilot returned to the cockpit, regained control, and the aircraft diverted to Incirlik Air Base and landed without further incident. The incident resulted in the grounding of the entire RAF Voyager fleet for 12 days until it was determined that the event was caused by the captain&#x27;s improperly stowed DSLR camera being jammed between the captain&#x27;s armrest and the side-stick, forcing the stick forward when the captain adjusted his seat forward.

<text>Heinrich Graf von Taaffe, 12th [[Viscount Taaffe]] (22 May 1872 ‚Äì 25 July 1928) was an Austrian landowner who until 1919 held hereditary titles from two different countries: he was a Count (&quot;Graf&quot;) in the nobility of Austria and a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland.

==Biography==
He was born at Innsbruck, the son of Eduard Graf von Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe, who had served as Minister-President of Austria from 1879 to 1893 and his wife, Countess Irma Cs√°ky (1833-1895), member of the Hungarian nobility. Under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, his name was removed from the roll of the Peers of Ireland by Order of the King in Council on 28 March 1919 for bearing arms against Britain in World War I.

On 28 April 1919, he lost his title as a Count of Austria-Hungary as well when the newly established Republic of Austria abolished nobility and outlawed the use of noble titles.

He married on 22 May 1897, in Vienna, Maria Magda Fuchs; they had a son: Richard (1898‚Äì1967). Upon the death of his first wife on 3 January 1918, he remarried to Agla√´ Isescu on 22 June 1919 at Ellischau.

He died in Vienna in 1928, aged 56.

<doc id="616498" wikidata="Q336238" url="?curid=616498" title="Kumba Ial√°">
<text>Kumba Ial√° Embal√≥, also spelled Yal√° (15 March 1953 ‚Äì 4 April 2014), was a Bissau-Guinean politician who was president from 17 February 2000 until he was deposed in a bloodless military coup on 14 September 2003. He belonged to the Balanta ethnic group and was President of the Social Renewal Party (PRS). In 2008 he converted to Islam and took the name Mohamed Ial√° Embal√≥. He was the founder of the Party for Social Renewal. In 2014, Ial√° died from a cardiopulmonary arrest.

==Early life==
Born to a farming family in Bula, Cacheu Region on 15 March 1953, Ial√° became a militant member of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) during his teenage years. The PAIGC sought independence from Portuguese colonial rule.

He studied theology at the Catholic University of Portugal, in Lisbon, and then philosophy (not completed). In Bissau, Ial√° studied law at the Law School of the University Am√≠lcar Cabral. After completing his studies, he was appointed director of the National Lyceum Kwame N&#x27;Krumah, where he also taught Philosophy and Psychology.

He spoke Portuguese, Crioulo, Spanish, French and English and could read Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

==Political career==
Ial√° was the head of a PAIGC delegation to Moscow in honor of the 70th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, but in 1989 he was expelled from the party for demanding greater democratic reform.

In March 1991, alongside Rafael Barbosa, Ial√° helped found the Democratic Social Front (FDS). On 14 January 1992, Ial√° left the FDS and formed the Social Renewal Party (PRS).

The first multiparty presidential election took place on 3 July 1994. Incumbent president and PAIGC candidate Jo√£o Bernardo &quot;Nino&quot; Vieira won 46.20% of the vote. Ial√° finished second, capturing 21.88% of the vote. Since no candidate won the required 50% of the vote for an outright victory, a run-off was conducted on 7 August. The opposition parties united behind Ial√°, but Vieira nevertheless won by a 4% margin (52.02% to 47.98%). Although the election was declared generally free and fair by election observers, Ial√° contested the results, claiming intimidation of his supporters. The Supreme Court rejected his claims and the results were validated. On 20 August, he accepted the results, but announced that the PRS would not participate in the new government.

On 28 November 1999, after a devastating civil war and the ousting of Vieira, a new presidential election was held. In the first round, Kumba Ial√° placed first with 38.81% of the vote, followed by interim president and PAIGC candidate, Malam Bacai Sanh√°, who won 23.37%. Ial√° was briefly hospitalized on 29 December 1999 due to high blood pressure, shortly before campaigning for the second round was to begin. He went to Lisbon for medical treatment on 30 December, and after returning to Guinea-Bissau in early January 2000, he launched his second round campaign on 9 January; he said that he was in good health and challenged Sanh√° to a debate. The second round, held on 16 January 2000, was easily won by Ial√°, who received 72% of the vote. He was sworn in as the president of Guinea-Bissau on 17 February.

Ial√° resigned as president of the PRS in May 2000, although he continued to play an influential role in the party.

===Presidency===
Kumba Ial√°&#x27;s tenure as the country&#x27;s head of state was characterized by sackings of ministers and other high officials. Concerns about the government&#x27;s financial management prompted protests, strikes and the suspension of International Monetary Fund aid. Ial√°&#x27;s relationship with General Ansumane Man√©, the leader of the rebellion that had toppled Vieira in the 1998‚Äì99 civil war, was difficult. Ial√° attempted to promote a number of military officers in November 2000, but Man√© said that Ial√°&#x27;s list of promotions was not the one Ial√° had previously agreed to with Man√©. Man√© announced that he was taking control of the armed forces, revoking Ial√°&#x27;s promotions and replacing the chief of staff, Ver√≠ssimo Correia Seabra. An outbreak of fighting followed, and Man√© was killed in a clash with government forces a week later, on 30 November.

Ial√° did not veto or promulgate the draft constitution approved by the National Assembly in 2001, instead sending it back to parliament with recommendations for increased presidential powers. Ial√°&#x27;s government claimed to have foiled a coup plot in early December 2001, although the opposition questioned its existence. Various members of opposition parties were subsequently detained and held without charge. In June 2002, he accused The Gambia of fomenting rebellion in Guinea-Bissau, a charge which the Gambian foreign ministry denied; Ial√° even threatened an invasion of The Gambia. Ial√° dissolved parliament in November 2002, appointed M√°rio Pires as caretaker prime minister, and called early elections for February 2003. These elections were repeatedly postponed, however: first to April, then to July, then to October. Some suspected that Ial√° sought to manipulate the law to ensure that he would remain in power.

On 12 September 2003, the electoral commission announced that it would not be able to finish voter registration in time to hold parliamentary elections as planned on 12 October. This together with a stagnant economy, political instability, and military discontent over unpaid salaries triggered a bloodless coup on 14 September. Ial√° was detained and placed under house arrest. General Ver√≠ssimo Correia Seabra, leader of the coup, referred to the &quot;incapacity&quot; of Ial√°&#x27;s government as justification for the takeover. Ial√° publicly announced his resignation on 17 September, and a political agreement signed that month prohibited him from participating in politics for five years. A civilian-led transitional government led by businessman Henrique Rosa and PRS secretary general Artur Sanh√° was set up at the end of September.

On 8 March 2004, ahead of legislative elections, Ial√° was released from house arrest. He announced that he would be participating in the PRS election campaign, despite the prohibition against his political activity. In the election, held on 28 March, the PRS won 35 out of 100 seats, making it the second largest party in the National People&#x27;s Assembly, after the PAIGC.

==2005 presidential election and afterwards==
On 26 March 2005, he was chosen as the PRS candidate for 19 June presidential election by the party&#x27;s national council, despite being officially banned from politics for five years. Ial√° submitted his candidate application to the Supreme Court on 11 April, arguing that since he had signed his agreement to respect his ban from politics at his home and not in his office, it was invalid. The Supreme Court cleared him to stand in the election in its list of approved candidates published on 10 May, with five judges in favor of permitting his candidacy and one opposed. The decision was based on the fact that Ial√° had resigned prior to the signing of the transitional charter which had barred him from politics, with the judges ruling that the charter should not be retroactively applied to Ial√° in a way contrary to his interests. Soon afterwards, on 15 May, Ial√° said that he was withdrawing his resignation as president and would resume office to serve out the remainder of his term. Although this increased the country&#x27;s political tension, the declaration did not appear to lead to much immediate consequence; a rally of some of Ial√°&#x27;s supporters was held two days later and was dispersed by police with tear gas.

In late May, ten days after declaring his resignation withdrawn, he occupied the presidential palace at night with a group of armed men for about four hours before leaving, according to an announcement by the army. According to official results he came in third in 19 June election with 25% of the vote, behind Malam Bacai Sanh√° and Nino Vieira, and thus could not participate in the second round run-off. Ial√° said that he actually came in first, with about 38% of the vote, and that the result was a fraud. At least four people were reported killed when Ial√°&#x27;s supporters clashed with police after the results were announced. Ial√° went to Senegal for talks with Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, along with Vieira and Sanh√°, and on 27 June he said at a news conference that he accepted the result in the interest of peace and democracy, while still claiming to have actually won. Ial√° said on this occasion that he &quot;rejected violence on principle&quot; and predicted that he would eventually regain the presidency, noting that his opponents were older than himself &quot;and tomorrow they will disappear.&quot;
On 2 July, Ial√° announced his support for Vieira&#x27;s candidacy in the second round. He called Vieira &quot;a symbol of the construction of the Guinean state and of national unity because he proclaimed our independence in the hills of Boe&quot; and said that he could &quot;be relied upon to defend our national independence, to oppose neo-colonialism, to build the republic and promote peace, stability and above all, national reconciliation&quot;. Given Ial√°&#x27;s sharp hostility to Vieira in previous years, this endorsement was viewed as surprising by many, and there was reportedly significant dissatisfaction with the decision among Ial√°&#x27;s supporters. The second round, held on 24 July, resulted in Vieira&#x27;s victory.

On 27 October 2006, Ial√° returned to Guinea-Bissau after a year of voluntary exile in Morocco. On 12 November he was elected as President of the PRS with about 70% of the vote at the party&#x27;s third ordinary congress, defeating Alberto Nambeia, although his re-election was disputed by opponents within the PRS. He denounced the government of prime minister Aristides Gomes as &quot;illegitimate and illegal&quot; and said that it should be dissolved and early parliamentary elections should be held.

In May 2007, following an appeal for the annulment of the third ordinary congress by a faction of the PRS opposed to Ial√°, the Regional Court of Bissau cancelled the congress&#x27; resolutions and removed Ial√° from the party leadership. On 23 August 2007, however, the Supreme Court of Guinea-Bissau reversed that decision and restored Ial√° to the party leadership.

After spending more time in exile in Morocco, Ial√° returned to Bissau on 7 July 2008 to register for the November 2008 parliamentary election. On that occasion, he predicted that the PRS would win the election with a majority of seats. Soon after his return, he converted to Islam in the city of Gab√∫ on 18 July 2008, taking the name Mohamed Ial√° Embal√≥. He also learned to speak Arabic. In the November 2008 election, PAIGC officially won a majority of seats, defeating the PRS. Ial√° initially disputed the official results and alleged fraud, although he later accepted PAIGC&#x27;s victory and said that the PRS would be a constructive opposition.

President Nino Vieira was killed by soldiers on 2 March 2009. In April, the PRS designated Ial√° as its candidate for the June 2009 presidential election. Some in the party who opposed Ial√°&#x27;s &quot;system of monopoly&quot; instead proposed the candidacy of Baltazar Lopes Fernandes, but they were unsuccessful.

==Death==
Ial√° suffered a &quot;sudden cardiopulmonary arrest&quot; and died on the night of 3 April‚Äì4 April 2014, aged 61. His personal security chief, Alfredo Malu, said that he &quot;had a malaise on Thursday night&quot; and died in the early hours of the next morning. The government announced that Ial√° had died of a heart attack, that it would have a &quot;special session of cabinet&quot; at 9:00 and that his body was taken to Bra military hospital. Malu added that the sudden illness late in the day had prevented him from meeting PRS candidates in preparation for the parliamentary election to be held on 13 April 2014. He was survived by his wife, Elisabete Ial√°, and their children.

<doc id="616505" wikidata="Q985542" url="?curid=616505" title="Shiloh (biblical city)">
<text>Shiloh (; ) was an ancient city and sanctuary in ancient Israel located in the West Bank, Palestine. According to the Hebrew Bible, Shiloh was one of the main centers of Israelite worship during the pre-monarchic period, before the First Temple in Jerusalem was built. After the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the Tabernacle was moved to Shiloh, and remained there during the period of the biblical judges.

Shiloh has been positively identified with modern Khirbet Seilun, a tell known in Modern Hebrew as Tel Shiloh. It is located north of Jerusalem, in the West Bank, to the west of the modern Israeli settlement town of Shilo and to the north of the Palestinian town of Turmus Ayya. Relative to other archaeological sites, it is south of the biblical town of Lebonah and north of Bethel. G. F. Moore has suggested identifying Bochim as Shiloh.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the word &quot;Shiloh&quot; is unclear. Sometimes, it is translated as a Messianic title, which means &quot;He Whose It Is&quot; or as &quot;Pacific, Pacificator&quot; or &quot;Tranquility&quot; and refers to the Samaritan Pentateuch. Regardless, the name of Shiloh the town is derived from and may be translated as &quot;Tranquility Town&quot;.

==Identification==
Shiloh is situated just east of the Jerusalem‚ÄìNablus road, 31¬†km north of Jerusalem. It was identified unambiguously with Khirbet Seilun, based on the much detailed biblical description of the site:

The Arabic name, Khirbet Seilun, preserves the ancient Hebrew name.

In the 4th century CE, Eusebius and Jerome demonstrated some awareness of Shiloh&#x27;s location as did the cartographer of the Madaba Map in the 6th century. In 1838, the American biblical scholar Edward Robinson became the first modern person to correctly identify Khirbet Seilun as Shiloh based on the biblical description of its location. Other evidence supporting the connection includes similarities between the names themselves; such a theory was put forth by A.T. Richardson.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
During the Middle and Late Bronze Age Canaan, Shiloh was a walled city with a religious shrine or sanctuary.

*Shiloh Strata 18 (MB IB or MB IIA).
*Shiloh Strata 17B-A (MBA II-III).
*Shiloh Strata 16 (LBA) in the 13th to 12th centuries BC.

===Iron Age===
Shiloh was one of the main centers of Israelite worship during the pre-monarchic period.

*Shiloh Strata 15-14 (Iron IA-B) in the 12th to 10th centuries BCE.
*Shiloh Strata 13-10 (Iron IIA-C) in the 10th to early 6th century BC.

==== Hebrew Bible ====
Shiloh is mentioned in the Books of Genesis, Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 1 Kings, Psalms, and Jeremiah.

Shiloh was first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Genesis, verse 49:10, &quot;&quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&#x27;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples&quot;.&quot;

In the Book of Joshua, when the Israelites arrived in the land, they set up there the Tent of Meeting (Hebrew: &quot;Ohel-Mo&#x27;ed&quot;). There Joshua and Eleazar divided the land among the tribes who had not yet received their allocation () and dealt with the allocation of cities to the Levites (). Subsequently, Shiloh became one of the leading religious shrines in ancient Israel, a status it held until shortly before David&#x27;s elevation of Jerusalem.

The tabernacle had been built under Moses&#x27; direction from God (Exodus 26) to house the Ark of the Covenant, also made according to Moses&#x27; instructions from God (Exodus 25). Talmudic sources state that the tent sanctuary remained at Shiloh for 369 years until the Ark of the Covenant was taken into the battle camp at Eben-Ezer (1 Samuel 4:3‚Äì5) and captured by the Philistines at Aphek (probably Antipatris). At some point during its long stay at Shiloh, the portable tent seems to have been enclosed within a compound‚Äîa Greek &quot;temenos&quot;. It was at Shiloh that Eli and Samuel ministered (). At some point, the Tent of Meeting was moved to Gibeon, which became an Israelite holy site under David and Solomon.

The people made pilgrimages there for major feasts and sacrifices, and Judges 21 records the place as the site of an annual dance of maidens among the vineyards.

According to 1 Samuel 1‚Äì3, the sanctuary at Shiloh was administered by the Aaronite high priest Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. According to this account, the young Samuel was dedicated by his mother Hannah there, to be raised at the shrine by the high priest, and his own prophetic ministry is presented as having begun there. Hophni and Phinehas are noted as malicious in their dealings with those who came to the shrine to offer sacrifices (). It was under Eli and his sons that the Ark was lost to Israel in a battle with the Philistines at Aphek. W.F. Albright hypothesized that the Philistines also destroyed Shiloh at this time; this conclusion is disputed, but supported by recent archaeological research. The place may have been destroyed later as well, though the biblical text records no such claimed destruction. Certainly, the shadowy figure of Ahijah the Shilonite, who instigated the revolt of Jeroboam I against David&#x27;s grandson Rehoboam (), came from there, and he bore the same name as the Aaronite priest that consulted the Ark for Saul in . Schley has claimed that the capture of the Ark and the death of Saul occurred in the same battle and that the later Davidic editors redacted the texts to make it appear as if Saul had ruled without either Tent Shrine or Ark, and thus without sacral legitimacy. This claim is disputed.

What is certain is that during the prophetic ministry of Jeremiah () over three hundred years later, Shiloh had been reduced to ruins. Jeremiah used the example of Shiloh to warn the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem what God would do to the &quot;place where I caused my name to dwell&quot;, warning them that their holy city, Jerusalem, like Shiloh, could fall under divine judgment.

According to Richard Elliott Friedman, the priesthood of Shiloh was the Elohist-source of the documentary hypothesis and also provided much of the material of the Deuteronomistic history, with the writer of this history (Jeremiah or somebody closely connected to him) being a descendant of these priests. If correct, this would make Shiloh a major source of the history part of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ===
According to historical records, the area&#x27;s population was diverse on the eve of the Maccabean revolt. During the revolt, there were clashes between the numerous ethnic groups nearby. Several accounts suggest the presence of Edomites in the region; Jewish communities are also implied. Like in western Samaria, it&#x27;s possible that Seleucid veterans settled here as well. Archeological evidence indicates that Shiloh, then a gentile settlement, was violently destroyed in the mid 2nd century BCE. It was suggested that this destruction might be connected to the conquests of Hasmonean leaders Jonathan Apphus and Simon Thassi.

===Byzantine period===

Jerome, in his letter to Paula and Eustochium, dated about 392‚Äì393, writes: &quot;With Christ at our side we shall pass through Shiloh and Bethel &quot; (Ep.46,13, PL 22, 492). The official church of Jerusalem did not schedule an annual pilgrimage to Shiloh, unlike Bethel. On the contrary, Samuel&#x27;s feast was held on August 20 in the village of Masephta (Mizpah). Even the pilgrims seemingly did not visit Shiloh, for the only one that mentions its name‚Äîthe sixth-century pilgrim Theodosius in &quot;De Situ Terrae Sanctae&quot; (ch. 4, CCSL 175, 116)‚Äîwrongly locates it midway between Jerusalem and Emmaus Nicopolis. The mistaken identification lasted for centuries, as appears, for example, on the Florentine map of 1300, which places Shiloh at Nabi Samwil, where the Tomb of Samuel is found. The sixth-century mosaic Madaba Map wrongly locates Shiloh east of Shechem, omitting the depiction of the church.

===Early Muslim and Crusader periods===
In 638 the Muslims conquered the area of Palestine. Muslim pilgrims to Shiloh mention a mosque called es-Sekineh where the memory of Jacob&#x27;s and Joseph&#x27;s deeds was revered. The earliest source is el-Harawi, who visited the country in 1173 when it was occupied by the Crusaders and wrote: &quot;Seilun is the village of the mosque es-Sekineh where the stone of the Table is found&quot;. Yaqut (1225) and el-Quarwini (1308, Marmardji, 94‚Äì95), write similarly.

==Archaeology==
===Overview===
Archaeological excavations have shown that the place was already settled from about 1750 BCE (Middle Bronze II or MB II, otherwise known as MB IIB according to the Albright school); however, it is not mentioned in any pre-biblical source. A tell and many impressive remains have been unearthed from the Canaanite and Israelite eras, with habitation lasting until the 8th century BCE. During the following 12 centuries Shiloh is solely noted as a station on sojourners&#x27; routes, usually having only its religious-historical significance to offer. Archaeological excavations have revealed remains from the Roman and Persian as well as Early and Late Muslim periods.

An impressive glacis has been located and pottery, animal remains, weapons and other objects have been recovered.

===History of excavations===
Soundings were first made in 1922 by Aage Schmidt. A Danish team led by Hans Kj√¶r (overseen by W.F. Albright) excavated for three seasons between the years 1926‚Äì32. A probe was done by Sven Holm-Nielson and Marie-Louise Buhl in 1963. An extensive excavation was done by Israel Finkelstein during the years 1981‚Äì84. Since 2006 further excavations have taken place there. Digs are currently run by Scott Stripling.

===Finkelstein excavations===
Finkelstein&#x27;s work established eight strata, ranging from Middle Bronze II to the Byzantine period.
====Bronze Age====
A massive wall is attributed to the Middle Bronze III (MB IIC) stage, preserved at a height of and width up to , with an extensive glacis.

====Iron Age====
The Iron I (Israelite) remains yielded a pillared two-storey public building near the top of the tell, the earliest attributed to Israelites. Collared rim storage jars and some cultic items were found in these buildings, pointing to usage as part of a cultic complex. More than 20 silos were uncovered from this era, included one with carbonized wheat. The destruction layer evident throughout the tell may have occurred in the wake of the Philistine victory at Eben-Ezer.

According to radiocarbon dating by Finkelstein, the site was abandoned around 1050 BCE, and then sparsely repopulated during the Iron II period. Jeremiah&#x27;s admonition in the course of his temple sermon, &quot;Go now to my place that was in Shiloh&quot; (), would have occurred during this era.

====Cultic site====
One of the more intriguing finds was that of a heap of pottery outside the city wall before the advent of the Israelite culture (c. 1000 BCE). This pile of pottery was the remnant of a number of animal sacrifices, which were tossed over the wall after completion of the ritual and then buried. This find points to a sacral status of Shiloh during the Canaanite period, a status adopted by the Israelites. The top of the tell, where Finkelstein supposes that the tabernacle would have been placed, is now exposed bedrock, offering no clues concerning Israelite worship (aside from the adjacent storage complex).

====Roman and Byzantine periods====
More substantive villages emerged in the Roman and Byzantine periods.

===Byzantine churches===
Excavations from 2006 to 2007, carried out adjacent to and just south of Tel Shiloh, exposed elaborate mosaic floors as well as several Greek inscriptions, one explicitly referring to the site as the &quot;village of Shiloh&quot;. During August‚ÄìSeptember 2006 archaeological excavations were carried out adjacent to the tell of Shiloh. A team led by the Archaeological Staff Officer for Judea and Samaria in Israel&#x27;s Civilian Administration Antiquities Unit, performing a clean-up operation at Shiloh this summer, a belated continuation to a previous 1998 dig, discovered the mosaic floor of a large Byzantine church which was probably constructed between 380 and 420 AD.

Three Byzantine basilicas have now been uncovered. The length of one, excavated by Hans Kl√¶r in the late 1920s, is . The width, also measured externally, is , but a wide room adjoins the building on the south side. This church had three naves, and 12 bases and two beautiful Corinthian capitals high and wide are preserved. Their appearance recalls the well-known fourth-century style, with separate leaves revealing the ribbing of the back leaves, and a smooth leaf under the corner.

A structure discovered in 2006 lies under a Muslim free-standing structure known as Weli Yetaim. It seems to have suffered problems of water drainage in its western section despite the installation of run-off pipes and troughs. It appears that the solution was to raise the level of the church and the laying of a new mosaic floor. It was the older, original floor at the lower level that was revealed during the summer of 2006. The mosaic contains geometric designs, a cross, flora representations and three inscriptions, one, a dedication of a bench, the second, a salute to the residents of &quot;Siloun&quot; (as set in mosaic in Greek script: &quot;CIŒªOYN&quot;) and the third, a general wish for good tidings. Another discovery of an addition to one of the basilicas occurred in 2013.

==Ambiguous use of &quot;Shiloh&quot; in Hebrew Bible==

Shiloh is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in Genesis as part of the benediction given by Jacob to his son Judah: &quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&quot; (). It could be a figure, perhaps the Messiah, or a place, as mentioned later in Judges and also in Jeremiah 41:5.

===Messianic Jewish and some Christian interpretations===
Messianic Judaism became attached to Shiloh as a result of this verse. Shiloh is believed to refer to Jesus by some Christians. Alternative translations have led others, including some Christians, to different conclusions.

<text>Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity is a rapid transit line of the Toronto subway. It serves Toronto and the neighbouring city of Vaughan in Ontario, Canada. It is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission, has 38 stations and is in length, making it the longest line on the subway system. It opened as the &quot;Yonge subway&quot; in 1954 as Canada&#x27;s first underground passenger rail line and was extended multiple times between 1963 and 2017. As of 2010, Line 1 was the busiest rapid transit line in Canada, and one of the busiest lines in North America. In 2022, it averaged over 670,000 riders per weekday.

==Route description==
The line forms a rough &#x27;U&#x27; shape, with two portions running generally north‚Äìsouth that meet at in the southern part of the city&#x27;s downtown, and then gradually spreading farther apart as they proceed northward. From Union station, the eastern portion of the line runs straight under or nearby Yonge Street, sometimes in an uncovered trench, for to its northeastern terminus at Finch Avenue, connecting with Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth at and Line 4 Sheppard at . This eastern portion, often just called the &quot;Yonge Line&quot;, serves Downtown Toronto, Midtown Toronto and York Mills before ending at Finch Avenue, the northern edge of North York Centre.

The western portion snakes northwesterly from Union, initially running straight under University Avenue and Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent to Bloor Street, where it turns westerly to run under Bloor Street for about . Along this stretch, it interchanges with Line 2 at and Spadina stations. At Spadina Avenue, it turns north to run for roughly under Spadina Road before curving northwesterly to continue along the Nordheimer and Cedarvale ravines to the foot of Allen Road at Eglinton Avenue. It reaches the surface and continues northward in the road&#x27;s median for past Wilson Station, after which it resumes travelling underground and runs northwesterly on an off-street alignment below suburban industrial areas and the York University campus until Steeles Avenue. From there, it turns to parallel Jane Street for roughly until its northwestern terminus in the neighbouring city of Vaughan&#x27;s planned downtown core, the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, at the intersection of Jane Street and Highway 7. This western portion serves the Annex and Forest Hill neighbourhoods in Old Toronto; Humewood‚ÄìCedarvale in the former city of York; Yorkdale‚ÄìGlen Park, Downsview, the York University Heights‚ÄìNorthwood Park areas in the former North York; and the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre in Vaughan.

== Name ==
The line&#x27;s name has been changed as it has been extended. Following its opening between Union Station and Eglinton Avenue along Yonge Street in 1954, it was called &quot;the subway&quot; (Yonge subway is its retronym). In 1963, it was extended along University Avenue to St. George station and renamed the &quot;Yonge‚ÄìUniversity Line&quot;. Briefly in 1966, the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity subway ran in two branches: one west along Bloor to Keele station (Yonge‚ÄìUniversity‚ÄìBloor), the other east along Bloor and Danforth to Woodbine station (Yonge‚ÄìUniversity‚ÄìDanforth) via Bay Lower station.

In 1978, the &quot;Spadina&quot; section was opened and the line became the &quot;Yonge‚ÄìUniversity‚ÄìSpadina Line&quot; (YUS). Although only two stations are on Spadina Road, a larger portion of the line was originally intended to follow the planned Spadina Expressway, which was partially built as Allen Road. The subway also had an additional internal route number: route 602.

Unofficially, subway lines were already numbered, but in October 2013, the TTC announced plans to display line numbers publicly to help riders to navigate the system. In March 2014, the line was officially numbered and renamed &quot;Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity&quot;, with the Spadina part being dropped from the name. Announcements, documentation and rapid transit maps across the system now refer to the line as &quot;Line 1&quot; or &quot;Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity&quot;.

==History==
===Early proposals===
There were several early proposals to build a subway along or near Yonge Street, many of which involved running streetcars in a tunnel. Here are some of the proposals.
* In 1909, an English company offered to build and operate a subway along Yonge Street from Eglinton Avenue to Front Street. The plan was abandoned because the city would take over public transit in 1921, and the company&#x27;s franchise would then terminate.
* In 1910, when running for mayor of Toronto, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; co-founder Horatio C. Hocken proposed building a &quot;tube&quot; along Yonge Street from north of St. Clair Avenue to Front Street. He dropped the idea after losing that election.
* In 1911, a city engineer planned a line from Bay and Front streets to Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue. The electorate rejected the plan.
* In 1931, City Controller Hacker proposed a north‚Äìsouth subway running from Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue south to Front and York streets, making a wide loop via Front, Scott, Victoria and Gerrard streets. The TTC rejected this proposal saying there was insufficient population to justify such a project.
* In 1942, the TTC proposed a north‚Äìsouth line under Bay Street from Union Station to Bloor Street then jogging over to Yonge Street to continue to north of St. Clair Avenue. This idea was rejected in favour of a subway completely along Yonge Street.

===Construction===
During World War II, workers travelling from their homes in &quot;northern Toronto&quot; (which would now be considered the downtown core) to the industrial areas to the east and west of the downtown area on Yonge seriously strained the existing road and streetcar networks. There was concern that the expected post-war boom in car ownership would choke the city with traffic. The scheme was first proposed by Toronto Transportation Commission in 1942 to relieve congestion, which was delaying their bus and tram services. The TTC formed a Rapid Transit Department and studied various solutions between 1942 and 1945.

A plan was put to the voters on January 1, 1946. The plan had two parts. First, it featured a &quot;rapid transit subway&quot; operated with subway trains from Eglinton Avenue to the north as far as College Street to the south. The line would continue directly under Yonge and Front Streets to Union Station. Second would be a &quot;surface car subway&quot;, diverting streetcar services off Queen Street and Dundas Street. This would run mostly along Queen Street, with each end angling north to reach Dundas Street west of Trinity Park and Gerrard Street at Pape Avenue. The route would run directly under Queen Street from University Avenue to Church Street, with the rest off-street. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour, and Toronto City Council approved construction four months later.

The plebiscite contained the condition that the federal government would subsidize 20 percent of the project. The federal Minister of Reconstruction, C.D. Howe, promised federal support in an October 3, 1945, letter. However, the funding fell through over a disagreement about the details of the employment arrangements. A scaled down proposal, about 20 percent smaller, was agreed to in its place. The work along Queen Street was abandoned temporarily, and the original $42.3million ($ in ) was reduced to $28.9million ($ in ) plus $3.5million ($ in ) for rolling stock. After a two-year delay due to postwar labour shortages, construction on the new subway did not start until September 8, 1949. A total of of material was removed and some of reinforcing steel and 1.4million bags of cement were put into place. A roughed-in station was constructed below station for a proposed Queen line, but that line was never built.

Service on the Yonge route would be handled by new rolling stock, and the TTC was particularly interested in the Chicago series 6000 cars, which used trucks, wheels, motors, and drive control technologies that had been developed and perfected on PCC streetcars. However, the United States was in the midst of the Korean War at the time, which had caused a substantial increase in metal prices, thus making the PCC cars too expensive for the TTC. Instead, in November 1951, an order was placed with the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in England for 104 cars for $7,800,000 ($ in ) including spare parts.
The Toronto Subway typeface and TTC logo were also designed during this period. The logo used during the subway&#x27;s development was designed by mid-century architect John C. Parkin and chief architect Arthur Keith. Against the wishes of Walter Paterson, the chief engineer, TTC chairman William McBrien and general manager H.C. Patten rejected the design in favour of one that was more similar to the one previously used on TTC vehicles.

===Opening===

After five years of construction, Ontario Premier Leslie Frost and Toronto Mayor Allan Lamport officially opened the long Yonge subway on March 30, 1954. It was the first subway in Canada.

The original Yonge Street subway line went from Union subway station near the namesake railway station north to Eglinton station. Dignitaries, including the premier and the mayor, rode the first train that morning, going north from the yards at Davisville station, and then from Eglinton station south along the entire line. The line was then opened to the public, and that day at 2:30¬†pm, the last streetcar made its final trip along the Yonge streetcar line.

===Operations and extensions from 1954 to 2017===
Trains operated at average speeds of . The plan to operate two-car trains during off-peak hours was abandoned in favour of four-car trains, and six-car trains were standard during most periods, with some eight-car trains used during peak periods.

On February 28, 1963, an extension was added to curve north from Union Station, below University Avenue and Queen&#x27;s Park to near Bloor Street, where it turned west to terminate at St. George and Bloor Street.

On February 26, 1966, the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line opened, from Keele to Woodbine. For six months, as a trial, the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line operated as two branches, Eglinton‚ÄìKeele, and Eglinton‚ÄìWoodbine. The interline was determined not worthy, and the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line was cut back to St. George on September 4, 1966.
On June 23, 1969, the University subway service from St. George to Union stations was discontinued entirely after 9:45¬†p.m. from Mondays to Saturdays and all day on Sundays and holidays. The 5B Avenue Road buses run in place between Eglinton and Front Street whenever the University subway did not operate, with side-jaunts to St. George station to capture passengers from the Bloor subway. This arrangement remained in place until January 28, 1978, when the Spadina subway opened north to Wilson Station.

On March 31, 1973, the line was extended north from to , and on March 29, 1974, to . These two extensions were part of the North Yonge Extension project, bringing the subway to North York.

Stations were also planned for Glencairn (between Eglinton and Lawrence, though another Glencairn station would be built later on the Spadina section), Glen Echo (between Lawrence and York Mills) and Empress (between Sheppard and Finch, later opened as North York Centre station).

On January 27, 1978, the Spadina segment of the line was opened, going from St. George station, the north terminus of the University line, to Wilson station. From St. George station, the segment ran north and northwest to Eglinton Avenue and William R. Allen Road, then north along the median of the Allen Road to Wilson Avenue. This extension had been proposed as part of the Spadina Expressway, but when the expressway portion south of Eglinton Avenue was cancelled after massive protests, the subway was still built following the route through Cedarvale Ravine. Hence, it was called the Spadina line, though it follows Spadina Road for less than .

On June 18, 1987, North York Centre station was added between Sheppard and Finch stations as an infill station to serve the rapidly growing North Yock City Centre.

On August 11, 1995, at 6:02¬†pm, the Russell Hill subway accident occurred as a southbound subway train heading toward Dupont station crashed under Russell Hill Drive, killing three passengers and sending 30 to hospital. This accident prompted the Toronto Transit Commission to review its practices and put resources into safety.

On March 31, 1996, the Spadina segment of the line was extended from Wilson station north to Downsview station (renamed in 2017). 
On November 17, 2016, with the Presto fare gates installed at Eglinton station, all of the stations along the line became Presto-enabled.

On December 17, 2017, the western portion of the line was extended north to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station in York Region, via York University. The Toronto‚ÄìYork Spadina subway extension (TYSSE) project built six new stations at a cost of $3.2 billion, with in Toronto and in York Region. The TYSSE was the first new section of a subway line to be opened since the opening of Line 4 Sheppard in 2002. In the year after the extension opened, most stations on the extension saw below average ridership compared to the rest of the subway system.

== Design ==
=== Line ===

The line is mostly underground but has several surface sections between Sheppard West and Eglinton West, and between Bloor‚ÄìYonge and Eglinton. Most of the line between Bloor‚ÄìYonge and Eglinton stations was originally constructed in open cut, with the short section between and stations having since been covered over. Evidence of this can be seen in the tunnel: there are no columns or walls between tracks, and ballast and drainage ditches are present, something not seen in the rest of the subway system. There are also tree stumps and the stubs of lamp posts in the tunnel. There are also clues outdoors: seemingly unnecessary railings along the sides of a nearby street, which was once a bridge over the tracks, and empty lots following the trains&#x27; right-of-way marked with signs warning heavy vehicles and equipment to keep off because they might fall through to the columnless tunnel below.

Most of the tunnel was constructed by a cut-and-cover method, but some sections were bored, as noted below. All stations, whether by transfer or fare-paid terminal, connect to surface TTC bus and/or streetcar routes. Other surface and train connections are noted below.

Since 1996, TTC stations have been built or modified with elevators, ramps and other features to make them accessible to all. , 30 stations on the line are fully accessible. All stations on the line are projected to be made accessible by 2025, as per the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.

Because the line opened in sections from 1954, it has a relatively high number of crossovers, which were mostly constructed at terminal stations to turn back trains. There are 17 diamond crossovers located between the service tracks along the length of the line. There are also eight storage tracks, which can also be used for reversals. The high number of possible turnbacks gives the TTC more flexibility when planning maintenance or in the event of an emergency service disruption.

=== Stations ===
The original design of the oldest stations in the subway system, which are on the Yonge line (from Union to Eglinton stations), are mainly utilitarian and characterized by vitreous marble wall tiles and the use of the Toronto Subway typeface for station names. Eglinton Station is the only station to retain this wall treatment, though Queen Station retains a narrow band of original blue Vitrolite tiles near the ceiling at platform level.

The design of the stations on the University line was mainly utilitarian and this style (sometimes referred to as &quot;bathroom modern&quot;) was later used for Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth as well. and stations have circular and semi-circular cross-sections because they are constructed in bored tunnels. Museum station was renovated in the late 2000s to have columns that resemble artifacts found in the nearby Royal Ontario Museum.

, (formerly Sheppard), and Finch stations are similar to each other in design, but have different colour schemes: Lawrence is red and cream, Sheppard is yellow and dark blue, and Finch is light grey, medium grey, and dark grey. York Mills station formerly followed the same design scheme‚Äîin light green and dark green‚Äîuntil it was renovated.

The section of the line between Spadina and Wilson stations (formerly the Spadina segment) opened in 1978 has art and architecture that is unique for each station, such as flower murals in Dupont station or streetcar murals in Eglinton West station. The art originally installed at and stations had been removed, as the former&#x27;s art had faded in sunlight and the latter was too costly to operate. Since late 2017, work is underway to restore the art in both stations, with Glencairn&#x27;s being fully re-installed in 2020, albeit modernized.

North York Centre station is an infill station. Its design is different from the other stations in the original North Yonge extension. Sheppard West station, which was opened in 1996 as Downsview station, has art and architecture that is different from the stations built earlier along its western portion of the line.

Stations on the 2017 extension from Sheppard West north to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, in keeping with the pattern of the original Spadina line, also feature public art and architecture from notable creators. However, the platform walls have no tiles or other cladding and are simply bare concrete, though structural elements on the platforms themselves are clad, as is the case with much of the Line 4 Sheppard stations.

===Names and terminal designation===
On the Yonge portion of the line, nearly all stations located at cross streets are named after said streets, while on the University portion, they are either named for local landmarks with the cross street subtitled below (e.g. ‚Äì ) or after cross streets but with a &quot;West&quot; suffix for stations at streets that have counterparts along Yonge, though Dundas West station is on Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. The pattern of using landmarks as station names was exclusively used on the original (southern) section of the University branch, and the &quot;West&quot; designated street-naming convention is typically used on the former Spadina (northern) section. The two interchange stations on the University branch where it intersects Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth are named and after the north‚Äìsouth cross streets of Line 2, which runs below Line 1 between these stations. Due to various factors, some stations along the Spadina portion are named, formerly were named, or are proposed to be renamed using landmark or district names, albeit without subtitles: the stations at Steeles Avenue and Highway 7 (which have no corresponding stations along the Yonge branch) are respectively named &quot;Pioneer Village&quot; (after the nearby Black Creek Pioneer Village, which has since been renamed the Village at Black Creek) and &quot;Vaughan Metropolitan Centre&quot; (after Vaughan&#x27;s new downtown core, based on the precedent set by and stations). was originally called &quot;Downsview&quot; but was renamed in 2017 to avoid confusion with the adjacent new station, and will be renamed &quot;Cedarvale&quot; (after the Cedarvale neighbourhood to the south) when it becomes an interchange station with the opening of Line 5 Eglinton in the fourth quarter of 2024.

As a result of the George Floyd protests, Toronto City Council indicated in 2020 that they intended to rename Dundas station because its namesake, Henry Dundas, delayed the British Empire&#x27;s abolition of slavery in the 1700s. , however, the Dundas name has yet to be changed.
Southbound station platform signage on both branches indicates as a terminal station due to it being located at the southernmost point of the line&#x27;s rough &#x27;U&#x27; shape, where it turns northward when travelling along either branch. The train destination signs display the northwestern terminal station as &quot;Vaughan&quot; rather than its full name, Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, for brevity. Until the 1990s, train destination signs read &quot;VIA DOWNTOWN&quot; after the terminal station name.

== Service ==
=== Operation hours and frequency ===
As with other TTC subway lines, Line 1 operates most of the day and is generally closed between 2:00¬†a.m. and 6:00¬†a.m. EST on weekdays and Saturdays, and between 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Sunday. Trains arrive at stations every 2 to 3 minutes during peak periods and every 4 to 5 minutes during off-peak periods. 

During the morning peak, from 6:00¬†am to 9:00¬†am Monday to Friday, half the trains are turned back at Glencairn station resulting in limited service north of that point. The turnback was moved from St. Clair West station to Glencairn station in 2016, and plans called for it to be moved farther to Pioneer Village station in December 2017 when the Line 1 extension opened.

Overnight service on the Yonge segment of the line is provided by 320 Yonge Blue Night from Queens Quay to Steeles Avenue with headways of 3 to 15 minutes. The University segment does not have an overnight service.

=== Rolling stock ===
Line 1 is operated using only the TTC&#x27;s Toronto Rocket (TR) subway trains, which are based on Bombardier&#x27;s Movia family of trains. Unlike other trains in the Toronto subway rolling stock, the TR trains have a &quot;six-car fixed&quot; articulated configuration with full-open gangways, allowing passengers to walk freely from one end to the other. The TR trains were scheduled for delivery starting between late 2009 and early 2010, but was delayed until late 2010 due to production problems. They entered revenue service on this line on July 21, 2011, replacing the older H5 and the T1 series trains, which had been used on this line. (The T1 series trains, which used to operate on this line from 1995 until 2015, were transferred over to Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth where they replaced the older H4 and H6 series trains).

From the line&#x27;s opening in 1954 until 1990, it was operated with G-series cars, and was also served with a mix of M1 and H1/H2/H4 subway cars between 1965 and 1999.

=== One-person train operation ===
Between 2021 and 2022, the TTC transitioned its Line 1 trains to one-person train operation (OPTO), which removes the secondary guard member ‚Äì stationed at the rear end of the trains ‚Äì who operated the doors. This change leaves only the subway drivers at the front to fill the dual role in 2023. OPTO went into effect between St. George and Vaughan Metropolitan Centre stations in November 2021, and was rolled out on the rest of the line effective November 20, 2022.

=== Gap trains ===
Gap trains are empty trains stored on pocket tracks and brought into service in a gap between full-route trains to relieve overcrowding. In October 2018, the TTC restarted the practice of using gap trains to relieve crowding at and stations, where respectively 225,000 and 135,000 passengers transfer trains daily. The TTC observed that one empty gap train can clear a crowded platform at Bloor‚ÄìYonge.

The TTC had previously run gap trains prior to late 2017 but had discontinued the practice because of a &quot;change in operating philosophy&quot;. The practice was reinstated in response to a potentially dangerous overcrowding incident that occurred at Bloor‚ÄìYonge in January 2018.

In October 2018, the TTC used three gap trains, which sat on pocket tracks near , and stations and moved into southbound service when station over-crowding was detected. For November 2018, the TTC planned to run a fourth gap train (which would sit on either the pocket track between and Glencairn stations or the pocket track between Eglinton West and St. Clair West stations) in the morning peak period plus another during the afternoon peak.

Gap trains can also increase the capacity of Line 1, which often runs above its scheduled capacity of 28,000 passengers per hour. To address that demand, the TTC normally runs an average of 25.5 trains per hour through Bloor‚ÄìYonge and St. George stations in the morning peak period. With three gap trains, it can run up to 28 trains per hour.

===Automatic train control===

Starting in the late 2010s, the TTC began converting its fixed-block signal system to a moving block‚Äîbased automatic train control (ATC) system on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity at a cost of $562.3million. Work to convert the line to use ATC was completed in September 2022.

The benefits of ATC are:

* a reduced headway between trains from 2.5 minutes to 2 minutes during rush hours, allowing a 25 percent increase in the number of trains that can operate
* fewer signal-related delays relative to the old fixed-block system
* a more efficient use of electricity, thus reducing operational costs
* allowance for single-track, bidirectional operation for trains in passenger service, albeit with reduced frequency, which allow for off-hour maintenance of the opposite track

==== History ====
In 2009, the TTC awarded a contract to Alstom to upgrade the signalling system of the existing section of Line 1, as well as equip its Toronto‚ÄìYork Spadina subway extension (TYSSE) into Vaughan, with moving block‚Äìbased communications-based train control (CBTC) by 2012. The estimated cost to implement ATC on Line 1 was $562million, $424million of which was funded by Metrolinx. 

The first section of the &quot;Urbalis 400&quot; ATC system on Line 1 entered revenue service on December 17, 2017, between Sheppard West and Vaughan stations, in conjunction with the opening of the extension project. On November 4, 2017, the TTC successfully completed a 13-day test of ATC with trains using it in regular service between and Yorkdale stations. At the conclusion of the test, the feature was turned off between these two stations to allow installation of ATC through the complex interchange at Wilson Yard.

ATC was permanently extended south to Dupont station on December 3, 2018; to St. Patrick station on May 12, 2019; to Queen station on February 24, 2020; to Rosedale station on November 21, 2020; to Eglinton station in October 2021; and finally to Finch station on September 24, 2022. 

There was a phase 6 for fixes, improvements and enhancements, as well as an adjustment to ATC at Eglinton station to accommodate the shifting of the Line 1 platform north by ; this was completed by May 14, 2023.

Prior to September 2022, ATC was operating on 79 percent of Line 1, and the partial implementation of ATC had resulted in improvements. Trains travelled between Vaughan Metropolitan Centre and Rosedale stations 3.5 minutes faster. Just prior to 2020, ATC allowed for an 8 percent increase in trains per hour, and the number of trains scheduled in southbound service in the morning peak at Bloor‚ÄìYonge station increased from 22 to 25.5 trains per hour. Signal violations decreased by approximately 50 percent from 2017 to 2020.

Converting all of Line 1 to ATC required the installation of 2,000 beacons, 256 signals, and more than of cable.

, the timetable for ATC conversion on Line 1 was:
==Yonge North extension==
The Yonge North subway extension is a Metrolinx proposal to extend the Yonge Street portion of Line 1 north of Finch station to Richmond Hill in York Region. As of 2021, the project entails building two underground stations plus two surface stations north of Finch station. One of the underground stations will be at Steeles Avenue, with the other located at Clark Avenue. From south of Highway 7, the extension would veer east away from Yonge Street, rising to the surface and then turning north along GO Transit&#x27;s Richmond Hill line. The two northernmost stationsone between Highway 7 and Highway 407 (dubbed &quot;Bridge station&quot; by Metrolinx) and another farther north at High Tech Roadwould be built on the surface along the railway corridor. Bridge station would also be a hub for Viva and GO Transit buses as well as being connected to the existing Langstaff GO Station. The estimated cost of the extension is $5.6billion.

Originally, prior to 2021, the extension was to have had five new stops, all underground, located at Cummer/Drewry, Steeles, Clark, Langstaff/Longbridge and the Richmond Hill Centre Terminal of Viva bus rapid transit. In May 2017, the originally proposed extension would have cost $5.6billion. However, by 2021, the cost of this version of the extension had risen to $9.3billion, resulting in a reduction of its scope.

The extension was projected to take a decade to build and would have replaced many of the 2,500 buses per day that run along the route. Ridership on the proposed extension was estimated at 165,000 per day. York Region estimated that the extension would help to create 31,000 jobs, and that the extension would carry 58million riders annually by 2031.

===Plan history===
On June 15, 2007, the Ontario government announced plans to fund this extension as part of a network of rapid transit growth called MoveOntario 2020.

In April 2009, the environmental assessment for the Yonge North subway extension was approved.

In November 2014, an addendum to the environmental assessment was approved to include an underground train storage facility and surface facilities.

By 2016, the province had committed to fund 15 percent of the preliminary engineering and design for the project.

On June 2, 2016, the provincial government gave $55million to Metrolinx in order to work with the TTC and York Region on a detailed plan for the subway extension.

In May 2017, Toronto mayor John Tory announced he would not support planning for the Yonge North subway extension unless there was a funding commitment for the Relief Line to relieve crowding on Line 1, expected to be at capacity by 2031. If such a funding commitment had been authorized, city staff could have completed 15 to 30 percent of the design for both projects, including schedules and better estimates, by the end of 2019. As of May 2017, planning was more advanced for the Yonge extension than for the Relief Line, though the latter has since been replaced with the Ontario Line under the premiership of Doug Ford.

By March 2021, Metrolinx had reduced the scope of the project in order to reduce the estimated project cost from $9.3billion to $5.6billion. The number of stations was reduced from six underground stations to two underground stations plus two surface stations. Two of the three originally proposed underground stations at Cummer Avenue, Clark Avenue and Royal Orchard Boulevard would be eliminated, saving $400 to $500million per station, with only the station at Steeles Avenue being retained. The two northernmost stations, Langstaff/Longbridge and Richmond Hill Centre, would be replaced by the surface Bridge and High Tech stations. As well, the storage yard at the north end of the line would be built on the surface rather than underground. Markham City Council voted to reject this new route realignment including all surface portions of the route. This in effect cancelled the route option that the city council voted against. In July 2021 and January 2022 respectively, the province announced that the stations at Clark Avenue and Royal Orchard Boulevard would be retained; Royal Orchard station was to be funded by revenues related to the intensification of the surrounding area as a transit-oriented community.

=== Procurement ===
The Yonge North subway extension consists of two primary contracts. The contracts are:

==== Advance tunnel ====
On April 27, 2023, Infrastructure Ontario and Metrolinx issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) for the advance tunnel contract, marking the first phase of procurement for the Yonge North subway extension.

This contract will include the design and construction of:

* A tunnel from the existing Finch station to a portal south of Highway 407
* Design and construction of launch and extraction shafts, tunnels, as well as headwalls for stations and support of excavation for emergency exit buildings
* Design, procurement, and supply of tunnel-boring machines and tunnel liner segments
* Reinforcement and improvement of soil and works necessary to facilitate tunnelling under and next to the CN Railway tracks and the York‚ÄìDurham sewage system
* Construction of CN right-of-way separation barriers to expedite safe corridor access and construction

To expedite construction, tunnelling will begin first, followed by a separate contract to build the stations, rail, and systems.

On December 1, 2023, Infrastructure Ontario (IO) and Metrolinx released a request for proposals (RFP) for the advance tunnel contract package. The three teams previously shortlisted through the RFQ processincluding CrossTransit Group (Vinci, Ferrovial, Sener, Janin Atlas), North End Connectors (Aecon, Dragados, Ghella, EXP, TYPSA), and Toronto-York Tunnel Connectors (Acciona, Bouygues, Hatch, Parsons)were invited to submit proposals detailing how they will deliver the project. Upon evaluating the proposals received, IO and Metrolinx expect to award this tunnelling contract in late 2024.

==== Stations, rails and systems ====
As of Infrastructure Ontario&#x27;s March 2023 update, there is no timeline identified for the procurement of the stations, rails and systems (SRS) contract.

===Capacity constraints===

Toronto council approved the plan in principle in January 2009 provided there were upgrades to the existing line to support the additional ridership from York Region. Specifically, Toronto politicians stated that the Yonge line does not have the capacity to support an extension to Richmond Hill until a separate relief line is built between Pape and Osgoode stations. In the morning rush hours, southbound trains on the Yonge line usually reach capacity between York Mills and Eglinton stations.

In March 2016, York Region officials stated their belief that SmartTrack, electrified GO service, the Spadina subway extension and automatic train control would be implemented by 2026 and be sufficient to support the extra ridership of an extension to Richmond Hill. Thus, the deputy mayor of Richmond Hill wanted to start construction of the extension by 2019. Vaughan politicians and officials noted a June 2015 Metrolinx report which indicated the Yonge line would have enough capacity to carry the new demand if the Spadina extension and Regional Express Rail on the Richmond Hill line were implemented. However, Metrolinx has no immediate plans to provide electrified GO service on the Richmond Hill line and Toronto transit advocate Steve Munro noted that the line would be at 96 percent capacity in the peak hour and there would be some overcrowding due to variations in traffic over the hour.

In March 2016, the Toronto mayor&#x27;s office said that SmartTrack and automatic train control may have also been required, which was reaffirmed by TTC spokesperson Brad Ross that June. This was affirmed again by Metrolinx in January 2019, thus reversing its opinion in its June 2015 report. The 2019 report also predicted that if both phase 1 of the then-planned Relief Line to Pape station and the Yonge North extension had been built, Line 1 would have been over capacity by 2041. At that point, the Relief Line would have needed to be extended farther north. However, the Relief Line was later replaced by the Ontario Line, which will run to Eglinton Avenue at Science Centre station.

===Busway===

Given the wait for the Richmond Hill extension, there were plans to construct Viva Bus Rapid Transit bus lanes along Yonge Street from Finch Avenue to Highway 7. However, by April 2014, the plan was scrapped in favour of only constructing the busway north of Highway 7. A group in York Region had lobbied for the plan&#x27;s cancellation due to concerns about a loss of treed boulevards and private property when widening Yonge Street for bus lanes through Thornhill. The revised busway opened in December 2020.

<doc id="616517" wikidata="Q171500" url="?curid=616517" title="Haile Gebrselassie">
<text>Haile Gebrselassie (; born 18 April 1973) is an Ethiopian former long-distance track, road running athlete, and businessman. He won two Olympic gold medals and four World Championship titles over the 10,000 metres. Haile triumphed in the Berlin Marathon four times consecutively and also had three straight wins at the Dubai Marathon. He also earned four world titles indoors and was the 2001 World Half Marathon Champion.

Haile had major competition wins at distances between 1,500 metres and the marathon, moving from outdoor, indoor and cross country running to road running in the latter part of his career. He broke 61 Ethiopian national records, ranging from 800 metres to the marathon, set 27 world records, and is regarded as one of the greatest long distance runners in history. He won the 2008 Berlin Marathon with a world record time of 2:03:59, breaking his own world record by 27 seconds. The record stood for three years. Haile&#x27;s 10,000¬†m Masters age group world record remains unchallenged since 2008. Due to his various achievements on track &amp; road running events, many called him as the &quot;Emperor of the Distance Running&quot;. Beyond his athletic achievements, he is a successful businessman, contributing to the development of his home country.

Haile was cited as one of the top 100 most influential Africans by &quot;New African&quot; in 2011. During the Hachalu Hundessa riots in 2020, Oromo mobs targeted the businesses and properties of non-Oromos. Haile&#x27;s hotels and resort were burned and 400 employees lost their jobs. In 2021, in the midst of the Tigray War, he pledged to join the fighting against the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front.

==Atheltics career==
===Early career===
Haile was born one of ten children in Asella, Ethiopia. As a child growing up on a farm, he used to run ten kilometres to school every morning, and the same distance back every evening. This led to a distinctive running posture, with his left arm crooked as if he was still holding his school books. Gebrselassie&#x27;s mother died from cancer when he was six.

In 1992, Haile gained international recognition in Seoul, South Korea, when he won the 5000-metre and 10,000-metre races at the 1992 World Junior Championships and a silver medal in the junior race at the World Cross Country Championships held in Boston, the United States.

The following year, in 1993, Haile won the first of what would eventually be four consecutive world championships titles in the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres at the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 World Championships. His win in 1993 was however his most infamous as he accidentally stepped on the heel of Moses Tanui&#x27;s shoe at the bell, causing it to fly off his foot. After the contact, with just one shoe, an angered Tanui moved out to a 10-meter lead, only to have Haile run him down on the final straight. Also at the 1993 World Championships he ran in the 5,000-metre race to finish a close second behind Ismael Kirui of Kenya. In 1994 he won a bronze medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Later that year he set his first world record by running 12:56.96 in the 5,000 metres, breaking Sa√Ød Aouita&#x27;s record by almost two seconds.

In 1995, Haile ran the 10,000 metres in 26:43.53 in Hengelo, the Netherlands, lowering the world record by nine seconds. That same summer, in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, Haile ran the 5000 metres in 12:44.39, taking 10.91 seconds off the world record 12:55.30 (established by Kenya&#x27;s Moses Kiptanui earlier in the year). Later that summer he won the 10k world championship with his final 200m being run in 25 seconds. This world record at the Weltklasse meet in Z√ºrich was voted &quot;Performance of the Year&quot; for 1995 by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; magazine. At the same Weltklasse meet in Z√ºrich in 1996, an exhausted Haile, suffering from blisters obtained on the hard track in Atlanta (where he had won the Olympic 10,000 metres gold), had no answer to the 58-second lap of Daniel Komen with five laps to go as Komen went on to win and just miss Haile&#x27;s record, finishing in 12:45.09. In 1997, Haile turned the tables on Komen at the same meet. Coming off his third 10K world championship gold medal, Haile beat Komen in another Z√ºrich classic on 13 August 1997, covering the final 200 metres in 26.8 seconds to break his 5000 metres world record with a time of 12:41.86. Komen, in turn, took Haile&#x27;s record only nine days later when Komen ran a 12:39.74 performance in Belgium.

===Middle career===
The next year, 1998, saw Haile lowering the indoor world records for 2000 and 3000 metres, enjoying success outdoors by taking back both the 5000 and 10,000 metres world records, as well as earning a share in the Golden League jackpot for winning all of his races in the Golden League series that summer. In June 1998 in Hengelo, Netherlands, Haile set a 10,000 metres world record 26:22.75, breaking Paul Tergat&#x27;s world record 26:27.85, running evenly paced 13:11/13:11 5K splits.

Just 13 days later, Haile took on the 5000 metres mark of Komen in Helsinki, Finland. Croatian pacemaker Branko Zorko took the pace out slowly, hitting 1000 metres in 2:33.91 and dropping out at the mile. Million Wolde and Assefa Mezgebu led Haile through 2000 metres in 5:05.62. His pacemakers could not maintain the pace, though, and Haile was left alone for a problematic solo effort six laps out. Hitting 3000 metres in 7:38.93, even the British commentators announcing the race counted him out. With four laps to go (8:40.00), Haile needed a sub-4-minute final 1,600 metres for the record. With one lap to go and in great pain, Haile took off, recording a final lap of 56.77 seconds and a final 1,600 metres of 3:59.36 (= 4:00.96-mile) to race to a 12:39.36 world record.
In 1999, Haile starred as himself in the movie &quot;Endurance&quot;. The film chronicled his quest to win Olympic gold in the 10,000 metres in Atlanta. On the track, he won 1500/3000 metres double at the World Indoor Track Championships, defended his Outdoor World Track Championships 10,000 metres title, and remained undefeated in all his races (which ranged from 1500 up to 10,000 metres).

In 2000, Haile again won all of his races, ranking first in the world in both the 5000 and 10,000 metres. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he became the third man in history to successfully defend an Olympic 10,000 metres title (after Emil Z√°topek and Lasse Vir√©n). The narrow Olympic victory over Kenya&#x27;s Paul Tergat came down to a blistering final kick, with Tergat&#x27;s 26.3-second last 200 metres being topped by Haile&#x27;s even faster 25.4. The winning margin of victory was only 0.09 seconds, closer than the winning margin in the men&#x27;s 100-metre dash final.

On 26 August 2001, he ran his first half marathon (16 wins out of 20) and won in 1:04:34. Also in 2001, Haile won the IAAF World half Marathon Championships and the bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. In the same year, he conceptualized the Great Ethiopian Run with Peter Middlebrook, which was latterly supported by Brendan Foster, British runner Richard Nerurkar the British ambassador to Ethiopia Myles Wickstead.
On 30 August 2003, Haile topped the polls when elected as a member of the IAAF Athletes Commission. Also in 2003, at the World Championships in Paris, Haile was involved in one of the most remarkable 10,000 metres races of all time while gaining a silver medal behind countryman Kenenisa Bekele. The last half of the 10,000 metres final at the championships was completed in a staggering 12:57.24 (12:57.2 for Bekele and 12:58.8 for Haile). According to the IAAF, &quot;Not only was this split the fastest closing 5000 metres in the championships 10,000m (the previous record was 13:12.12, recorded in Atlanta), but it was also the fastest 5000 metres in a global championship surpassing the 12:58.13 Salah Hissou recorded when he won the 5,000m in Sevilla&#x27;99.&quot; (This remark remained true until a week later when the World Athletic Championships 5000 metres medalists (including Bekele) all ran faster than the second 5000 metres split in the previous week&#x27;s 10,000 metres.) &quot;The difference between the closing 5000 metres splits (12:57.24) and the 5000 metres World record (12:39.36) was 17.98 seconds, which is a record. The previous best of 18.4 seconds (13:31.4 for the closing 5000 metres when the World Record was 13:13.0) was recorded in the 1976 Olympics.&quot;

In the 2004 Athens Olympics, Haile sought to become the first man in history to win three straight Olympic gold medals in the 10,000 metres. He was unable to do so due to an injury; however, he finished fifth in a race won by his compatriot Kenenisa Bekele, who had broken both of Haile&#x27;s major track world records, the 5000 metres and the 10,000 metres records. Shortly before the Athens games, Haile was unable to train for three weeks due to inflammation of his Achilles tendon. The injury was severe enough that he would not have competed otherwise but did so because of significant pressure from his country. This loss in the final period of training likely cost him a medal.

===Later career===
Since leaving the track after the 2004 Olympics, Haile has focused on road racing and the marathon. His adult marathons to date include London 2002 (3rd place), Amsterdam 2005 (1st place), London 2006 (9th place), Berlin 2006 (1st place), Fukuoka 2006 (1st place), London 2007 (DNF), Berlin 2007 (1st place and World Record), Dubai 2008 (1st place), Berlin 2008 (1st place and another World Record), Dubai 2009 (1st place) Berlin 2009 (1st place), Dubai 2010 (1st place), and NYC 2010 (DNF).

In 2002, Haile made his debut at the marathon at the London Marathon. He started the race at a very fast pace, within world record time. He was unable to hold it, however, as world record holders Khalid Khannouchi and Paul Tergat both eventually passed him. Khannouchi broke his world record, while Haile finished third.
In 2005, Haile went undefeated in all of his road races. This included a British all-comers&#x27; record in the 10K in Manchester (27:25), a win at the Amsterdam Marathon in the fastest marathon time in the world for 2006 (2:06:20), and a new world best for 10 miles in Tilburg Ten Miles race, The Netherlands (44:24). (His unofficial split of 41:22 at the 15K mark was 7 seconds faster than the official world best.)

Haile started 2006 positively on 15 January by setting his first world record on American soil. He ran the half marathon of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Arizona Marathon to beat Samuel Wanjiru 2005 record for the distance by a full 21 seconds with a time of 58 minutes and 55 seconds. During the race he passed the 20¬†km mark in 55:48, breaking also Paul Tergat&#x27;s record for this distance which had stood since 1998. That year also marked another victory for Haile as he shattered the 25¬†km world road record (albeit in non-IAAF ratified fashion) by 68 seconds in a time of 1:11.37. The race was organized where Haile and six other runners would run 5 kilometres and then cross the starting line of the 20-K Alphen race in Alphen aan den Rijn of the Netherlands.

On 23 April 2006, he finished ninth in the London Marathon with a time of 2:09:05 (the race was won by Kenyan Felix Limo, who clocked 2:06:39). Haile referred to the ninth-place finish as &quot;the worst race of my career&quot;. However, on 24 September he came back with a win in the Berlin Marathon in the fastest time of the year, 2:05:56. His time in Berlin made him only the fifth man in history to run under 2:06 for the marathon. This was followed by a win in the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan at 2:06:52.

In London on 22 April 2007, Haile challenged the 2006 London Marathon winner Felix Limo, 2005 London Marathon winner Martin Lel, 2004 Athens gold medalist Stefano Baldini, 2006 New York Marathon winner Mar√≠lson Gomes dos Santos, and the then marathon world record holder Paul Tergat in what organizers anticipated would be an exciting race. However Haile dropped out at the stage complaining of a stitch and inability to breathe, which turned out to be an allergic reaction to the pollen in the air. This left the 2005 winner Martin Lel to come home in the first place.

One month later, Haile made a surprise return to the track for the first of two stadium races that summer. In the first, he ran a 26:52.81 finishing fifth in a very competitive 10,000 metres race in Hengelo, The Netherlands. It was the first time a man over 30 ran the 10,000 m in less than 27 minutes. Then, on 27 June 2007, Haile launched an attack upon the world record for the one hour run, in Ostrava, Czech Republic. This record attempt was successful as Haile passed the hour mark at 21,285¬†metres (13 miles 397 yards), eclipsing the previous best of 21,101¬†metres, set by Mexican Arturo Barrios in La Fl√®che, France, on 30 March 1991. Furthermore, Haile covered 50 laps (20,000¬†m) in 56:25.98, another world best, well within the previous 56:55.6 also set by Barrios in 1991. These were his 23rd and 24th world records.

Haile made his running debut in New York City when he won the New York City Half Marathon on 5 August 2007, in 59:24, breaking the previous course record by two minutes. His win in the Lisbon Half Marathon (59:15) in March 2008 gave him a perfect record of 9‚Äì0 in winning all of his half marathons. He lost his first half marathon in Den Haag (14 March 2009), when he was beaten by Sammy Kitwara (59:47 for Kitwara, 59:50 for Haile).

On 30 September 2007, Haile won the Berlin Marathon in 2:04:26 (4:44.8 per mile), setting the world record and shaving 29 seconds off Paul Tergat&#x27;s record, set on the same course in 2003. His victory further energized the celebrations of the Ethiopian Millennium (unique to the Ethiopian calendar), which began on 12 September 2007.

Before the 2008 Dubai Marathon, his manager suggested that Haile would be able to run a sub 2:04 time for a new world record. While Haile agreed that a sub 2:04 was possible, he stated that the conditions would need to be perfect for such a time. The event was held on 18 January 2008 and was won by Haile in a time of 2:04:53, making it the second-fastest marathon in history. However the early pace had been too fast and he was unable to continue at that speed, resulting in a time 27 seconds short of his world record.

At the Hengelo FBK-Games on 24 May, Haile ran 26:51.20 for the 10,000 metres to finish a close second behind countryman Sileshi Sihine&#x27;s 26:50.53. This is the Master 35‚Äì39 age group world record. His nine career sub-27-minute 10,000-meter performances are more than any other athlete except for Kenenisa Bekele, who also has nine.

Because of Beijing&#x27;s air pollution levels, Haile decided to withdraw from the marathon at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He suffers from asthma and said that running in such conditions might be harmful to his health. Haile later admitted that he regretted the decision as the Beijing air was cleaner than expected. He did, however, run the 10,000 metres on 17 August, finishing sixth with a time of 27:06.68. The gold medal went to his countryman and current world record holder, Kenenisa Bekele with a 27:01:17 Olympic record winning time. The following month, on 28 September 2008, he defended his Berlin Marathon title, averaging 2:56.5 per kilometer (4:43.7 per mile) for a time of 2:03:59, breaking his own world record by 27 seconds.
Haile won the Dubai Marathon on 16 January 2009 but fell short of breaking his own world record that he had set four months earlier on the flat course. He finished in 2:05:29, well ahead of countryman Deressa Chimsa. In September of that year, he won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth consecutive time. He attempted to break the world record he had set the previous year but, despite a quick start, warm conditions saw him finish in 2:06:08, two minutes away from his best mark. He did, however, pass the 30-kilometer point in 1:27:49, which was a new world record for a road 30K.
In 2010, he tried to attack his world record for the third consecutive time at the Dubai Marathon 2010. Although he won the race with a time of 2:06:09, he failed to break his 18-month world record. In a post-race interview, Haile revealed that he had suffered back pain, requiring intensive pre-race physiotherapy, resulting from having slept in a bad position. His problems continued at the NYC Half Marathon, where he pulled up mid-race visibly uncomfortable in his running. He had an easy victory in the inaugural edition of the 10K de Madrid in April. He scored his third victory at the Great Manchester Run the following month, although he missed out on Micah Kogo&#x27;s course record. He followed this with his first win at the Great North Run in September, finishing the half marathon in a time of 59:33 minutes.

He is also mentor and ambassador for the G4S 4teen, a programme supporting 14 young athletes.

===Retirement===
On 7 November, after dropping out of the 2010 New York City Marathon with an inflamed knee, Haile announced his retirement. Days later, he posted to his Twitter account that he was reconsidering his decision and wanted to run in the 2012 London Olympics. Haile had stated previously that after retiring he would like to enter politics, with scepticism from the public about his knowledge on politics and the unfamiliar culture of celebrities holding public office in Ethiopia. However he won his first race back in a 10k road race in Angola with a new course record of 28:05 and beat countryman Deriba Merga and the Kenyan Josphat Menjo who had run the fastest 10000m of that year.
Haile missed the 2011 Tokyo Marathon due to an injury, but won the half marathon at the Vienna City Marathon on 17 April 2011. About a month later Haile easily won the Great Manchester Run in England for the fourth time, finishing in 28:10. On 26 September he suffered a double setback when he dropped out of the Berlin Marathon (again suffering from respiratory difficulties of exercise-induced asthma) and saw his world records for 30 kilometres and the marathon broken by the man with whom he had been duelling, Patrick Makau. Haile was absent from the press conference later that day, but his manager Jos Hermens announced that while it was &quot;the end of an era of record-breaking for Haile, it&#x27;s not the end of his career&quot;. He returned to his winning ways at the Birmingham half marathon with a new course record and followed that up with a win at the Zevenheuvelenloop in November, taking his third career victory at the Dutch 15K race.

In 2012, Haile ran in the Tokyo Marathon and, after surging to the lead and putting a gap on the field with 6¬†km to go, faded and finished in 4th, in a time of 2:08:17. However, he bounced back to win the Vienna Half Marathon in 1:00:52, catching Paula Radcliffe who was given a 7:52-minute head-start. He was not selected for the Olympic marathon team, but after winning the Great Manchester Run with a fast time of 27:39, beating marathon world record holder Patrick Makau, world marathon leader Ayele Abshero and Olympic marathon medallist Tsegay Kebede, by a distance of over 100 metres, he decided to aim for a place in the 10,000 m race. He attempted to earn an Olympic spot at the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo, the stadium in which he had broken four world records. However, in extremely hot weather he finished seventh with a time of 27:20.39, sixth amongst Ethiopians, and did not qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, he did appear at the opening ceremony as one of the eight flagbearers who brought the Olympic flag into the stadium. Another outing at the Fukuoka Marathon, however, saw him enter as the favourite but drop out at 32¬†km.

On 14 April 2013, Haile won the open field of the Vienna City half marathon with a time of 01:01.14. He set his first over-40 world record with a time of 46:59 for 10 miles in Switzerland, on 15 September 2013. He took 3rd overall in the 2013 BUPA Great North Run, 32 seconds behind the winner Kenenisa Bekele and 31 seconds behind the reigning Olympic and world champion Mo Farah.

Haile has announced his retirement from competitive running after finishing 16th in the Great Manchester Run on Sunday 10 May 2015. It brings to an end a 25-year career in which he claimed two Olympic gold medals, eight World Championship victories and set 27 world records. &quot;I&#x27;m retiring from competitive running, not from running. You cannot stop running, this is my life,&quot; he told BBC Sport.

Haile remains the world record holder in the 10-mile run.

Currently, Haile is the former president of the Ethiopian Athletics Federation, has been selling Hyundai cars in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since 2009, and cooperates with Hyundai for the Marathon Motors Engineering factory there which started assembling the electric Hyundai Ioniq in July 2020. He has become a small-lot coffee farmer in Ethiopia. His coffees can be found under his estate name, Haile Estate, such as the Sun Dried Ethiopian Haile Estate Coffee, which is distributed by Starbucks Reserve.

==Business career==
Haile Gebrselassie ventured into an entrepreneurship career in 1995, investing earnings from his sporting achievements that led to establishing companies. Until recent years, he has had 600 staff and offices every day. In 2010, Haile opened Haile Resorts in Lake Hawassa, and the resort quickly expanded to include destinations in Amhara, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People&#x27;s Region. He recently inaugurated the Grand Haile Resort in Addis Ababa headquartered in Lam Beret. Haile has a dealership for Hyundai cars in Ethiopia and started assembling Hyundai electric cars in 2020.

Haile owned Marathon Motors, a vehicle business that also assembles Hyundai cars, and which recently rolled off the first electric car from its assembly plant. Haile owned several businesses and is involved in real estate projects and owns four hotels, a coffee plantation. In 2015, there was estimated 1,000 employees and reached 3,000 employees across his investments in Ethiopia and beyond. Haile currently received 30 million birr revenue from various businesses.

<text>Edward J. Nately III is a fictional character in Joseph Heller&#x27;s satirical 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

==Background information==
Nately starts off the book as a 19-year-old Lieutenant, who will be &quot;twenty next January&quot; and who came from a very rich and respected family. (In a flashback his mother reminds him that‚Äîin contrast to such vulgar upstarts as the Astors, &quot;whose family, I believe, still lets rooms,&quot; and the &quot;vulgar tugboat captain&quot; Vanderbilt‚Äî&quot;You are a Nately, and the Natelys have never done &quot;anything&quot; for their money.&quot;) His family originally enlisted him to serve in the Air Corps, believing the war would be over by the time he finished his training and that he would mingle with &quot;gentlemen&quot;. Therefore, Nately could gain the pride of enlisting without actually having to fight. Instead, he mingled with Yossarian and Dunbar, and was sent overseas. He lives in a tent with McWatt next to Havermeyer&#x27;s tent.

His most notable contribution to the book is his involvement with a whore, who is for the most part uninterested in him until he gives her some time to sleep. He is often filled with American optimism, shown by his desire to marry his whore and send her kid sister to a respected U.S. college. He is killed on a mission when Dobbs accidentally flies his plane into Nately&#x27;s while attempting to evade flak. Nately&#x27;s whore blames Yossarian and spends the rest of the book trying to murder him with various objects such as a potato peeler.

A chapter later deleted from &quot;Catch-22&quot; entitled &#x27;Love, Dad&#x27; gives Nately&#x27;s full name as Edward J. Nately III.

==In other media==
Art Garfunkel portrayed Nately in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel directed by Mike Nichols.
In the film, Nately dies in the bombing of the base by Milo Minderbinder. In the 2019 miniseries, he is portrayed by Austin Stowell.

==Nately&#x27;s Whore==
Nately&#x27;s whore is portrayed as a very tired prostitute who has no interest in sex, and would rather sleep. She is constantly hounded by her younger sister. Therefore, Lieutenant Nately, who is madly in love with her, cannot persuade her to engage in a meaningful relationship with him. She engages him sexually, but it is cold and mechanical, for she refuses to spend any time with Nately without pay. Captain Black would frequently sleep with her to annoy Nately.

However, when she finally does get some rest, she falls as madly in love with Nately as he did for her. Shortly after, Nately dies on a combat mission. When Yossarian arrives in Rome to deliver the bad news to her, Nately&#x27;s whore blames Yossarian for Nately&#x27;s death. She subsequently dedicates herself to pursuing Yossarian, and ambushes him several times throughout the remainder of the novel in an attempt to exact revenge for Nately&#x27;s death by stabbing him. She finally succeeds in stabbing him in the side, sending him to the hospital. Another one of her attacks is the last, albeit minor, comical event in the book.

===The Kid Sister===
Nately&#x27;s Whore&#x27;s Kid Sister is another character in &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

Her real name is never mentioned, and Heller only refers to her in terms of her relationship with her sister, even though she is specifically mentioned more than once.

In the plot of the story, she constantly interrupts Nately and his whore while they are having sex as the little girl wants to become a prostitute like her sister. Towards the end of the novel, Yossarian tries to save her after she and all of the prostitutes have been thrown out of their apartment by Military Police. Her whereabouts after this are unknown. At the end of the novel, Yossarian vows to find her and take her with him to Sweden.

<text>√âtr√©ham () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern 
France.

== Toponymy ==
&quot;Oesterham&quot; in 1350.

Probably Old Saxon &quot;*wester&quot; or Old English &quot;westre&quot; related to &quot;west&quot; (Old High German &quot;westar&quot;, west-; see Westerham, Kent) and &quot;hƒÅm&quot; &quot;home, hamlet&quot; or, less probably, Old Saxon &quot;≈çstar&quot; related to &quot;east&quot; (see Ouistreham). This place name corresponds to Saxon settlements in Bayeux and in the surrounding Bessin Region (the so-called &quot;Otlinga Saxonia&quot;) in the 5 - 6th century or to Anglo-Scandinavian settlements later in the 10th.

== History ==
===World War II===
The village was bombed on 8 June 1944, two days after the D-Day landings, by the Big Red One (U.S. First Division). It was liberated one day later, and about 600 German soldiers were taken prisoner. After the liberation, the Allies used the place called &quot;Mont Cauvin&quot; in the same commune to store their oil until the conquest of Cherbourg.

<doc id="616534" wikidata="Q4943038" url="?curid=616534" title="Book of Jasher (Pseudo-Jasher)">
<text>The Book of Jasher, also called Pseudo-Jasher, is an eighteenth-century literary forgery by Jacob Ilive. It purports to be an English translation by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus of the lost &quot;Book of Jasher&quot;. It is sometimes called &quot;Pseudo-Jasher&quot; to distinguish it from the midrashic &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; (&quot;Book of the Upright,&quot; Naples, 1552), which incorporates genuine Jewish legend.

==Details==
Published in November 1750, the title page of the book says: &quot;translated into English by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus, of Britain, Abbot of Canterbury, who went on a pilgrimage into the Holy Land and Persia, where he discovered this volume in the city of Gazna.&quot; The book claims to be written by Jasher, son of Caleb, one of Moses&#x27;s lieutenants, who later judged Israel at Shiloh. The book covers biblical history from the creation down to Jasher&#x27;s own day and was represented as the Lost Book of Jasher mentioned in the Bible.

The Book of Jasher contained naturalistic explanations for the miracles of the Old Testament.

The provenance of the text was immediately suspect: the eighth-century cleric Alcuin could not have produced a translation in the English of the King James Bible. There is an introductory account by Alcuin of his discovery of the manuscript in Persia and its history since the time of Jasher, and a commendation by John Wycliffe.

== Reception ==
The supposed lost book was declared an obvious hoax by the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; in the December of the year of publication.

The printer Jacob Ilive was sentenced in 1756 to three years&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour in the House of Correction at Clerkenwell, for writing, printing, and publishing the anonymous pamphlet &quot;Some Remarks on the excellent Discourses lately published by a very worthy Prelate by a Searcher after Religious Truth&quot; (1754). The pamphlet was declared to be &quot;a most blasphemous book&quot;, for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ and revealed religion. Ilive remained in gaol until 1758, spending time writing.

In 1829, a slightly revised and enlarged edition of the Book of Jasher was published in Bristol, provoking attacks against it. Photographic reproduction of this 1829 edition was published in 1934 by the Rosicrucians in San Jose, California, who declared it an inspired work.

<text>Luis √Ångel Gonz√°lez Macchi (born 13 December 1947) is a Paraguayan politician who served as the 46th President of Paraguay from 1999 to 2003. He was not elected to the presidency but rather assumed it after the assassination of Vice President Luis Mar√≠a Arga√±a and the subsequent resignation of President Ra√∫l Cubas, as he was the President of the Senate at the time. A member of the Colorado Party, Gonz√°lez Macchi served in both houses of the Paraguayan Congress prior to his presidency.

== Career ==
He was the President of the Paraguayan Senate from 1998 to 1999.
As the president of the Senate, Gonz√°lez Macchi was next in line for the presidency on March 23, 1999 following the assassination of Vice President Luis Mar√≠a Arga√±a. President Ra√∫l Cubas was suspected of being involved in the assassination. This, combined with other scandals resulted in his impeachment by the Chamber of Deputies on March 24. Realizing that he faced almost certain conviction and removal by the Senate, Cubas resigned on March 29, and Gonz√°lez Macchi ascended to the presidency.

As president, Gonz√°lez Macchi attempted to create a coalition government to spur cooperation within Paraguay and repair the economy which had been damaged by the political crisis. This coalition did not last long, as the Authentic Radical Liberal Party left it in 2000, leaving Gonz√°lez Macchi without a majority in the legislature. Gonz√°lez Macchi became ever more unpopular as the economy sagged further and found passing legislation difficult because few legislators would vote on bills that he pushed for. There was a coup attempt in 2000 and an impeachment attempt in 2001, though both failed. Gonz√°lez Macchi was able to hold on to his presidency until the elections of 2003, which Nicanor Duarte won. He could not run for a full term in this election, as the Constitution bars any sort of reelection for a president even if he serves a partial term. He left office on August 15, 2003.

On December 4, 2006, Gonz√°lez Macchi was sentenced to eight years in prison for fraud and embezzlement. The sentence was overturned on appeal.

<text>Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House is a 1948 American comedy film directed by H. C. Potter, and starring Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Written and produced by the team of Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, it was an adaptation of the 1946 novel of the same name written by Eric Hodgins and illustrated by William Steig.

The movie was the third and last pairing of Grant and Loy, who had shared a comfortable chemistry in &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (1947) and &quot;Wings in the Dark&quot; (1935).

It was a box office hit upon its release. Warner Home Video released it to DVD with restored and remastered audio and video in 2004. It was loosely remade in 1986 as &quot;The Money Pit&quot;, starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long, and in 2007 as &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot;, starring Ice Cube.

==Plot==
In the late 1940&#x27;s, Jim Blandings, a successful account executive in the advertising business, lives with his wife Muriel and two daughters, Betsy and Joan, in a cramped New York apartment. Muriel secretly plans to knock out a wall and remodel their apartment for $7,000. After rejecting this idea, Jim comes across an ad for new homes in Connecticut and they get excited about moving. Planning to purchase and &quot;fix up&quot; an old home, they contact a real estate agent, who convinced them to buy &quot;the old Hackett Place&quot; in (fictional) Lansdale County, Connecticut‚Äîa leaning, dilapidated, nearly 200-year old farmhouse on some 35 acres where, they are told, General Gates stopped to water his horses during the Revolutionary War. They buy the property for five times the going rate per acre for locals, provoking Jim&#x27;s friend and lawyer Bill Cole to chastise him for following his heart rather than his head.

The old house, dating from the Revolutionary War era, turns out to be structurally unsound and must be torn down before the previous owner&#x27;s mortgage is paid off. The Blandings hire architect Henry Simms to design and supervise the construction of a new home for $18,000, which Muriel insists must have four bedrooms and four bathrooms. From the original purchase to the completion of the new home, a long litany of unforeseen troubles and setbacks‚Äîincluding digging a deep well only to find a spring just a few feet under the foundation‚Äîbeset the hapless Blandings. The demolished house&#x27;s owner also sues them for the balance of his mortgage. Meanwhile, back in the city, Jim is assigned the task of creating an advertising slogan for a Spam-like product called WHAM, an account that has destroyed the careers of the previous executives assigned to it. Jim also suspects that Muriel is cheating on him when Bill spends a night in the house during a violent thunderstorm, with Muriel being the only other person present.

With mounting pressure, skyrocketing costs, and the encroaching deadline for his assignment, Jim starts to wonder why he wanted to live in the country. Bill observes that although he has been the voice of doom, pointing out all the ways they were being cheated, when he looks at what they have finally built, he realizes that some things &quot;you &quot;do&quot; buy with your heart and not your head. Maybe those are the things that really count.‚Äù Gussie, the Blandings maid and cook, provides Jim with the perfect WHAM slogan‚Äî&quot;If you ain&#x27;t eating WHAM, you ain&#x27;t eating ham&quot;‚Äîand saves his job. The Blandings reward her with a $10 raise, and her likeness is used in the WHAM ad campaign. The film ends with the family and Bill enjoying the beautiful front yard. Jim, who is seen reading the book &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,&quot; invites the audience to ‚Äúdrop in and see us some time.‚Äù

==Cast==
==Reception==

According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas have a highly experienced way with this sort of comedy, and director H. C. Potter is so much at home with it that he gets additional laughs out of the predatory rustics and even out of the avid gestures of a steam shovel. &quot;Blandings&quot; may turn out to be too for small-town audiences, and incomprehensible abroad; but among those millions of Americans who have tried to feather a country nest with city , it ought to hit the jackpot.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;as straight entertainment, this ambling and genial report on a young advertising man&#x27;s disasters (and final triumph) in becoming a country squire is as much casual fun as can be looked for on our sparsely provided screen.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a mildly amusing comedy&quot; with Grant &quot;up to his usual performance standard,&quot; but found the script to be flawed when an &quot;unnecessary jealousy twist is introduced, neither advancing the story nor adding laughs.&quot;

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the film as &quot;quite ingeniously put together,&quot; comparing it to &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; and finding it &quot;just as amiable&quot; as that earlier film.

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;a first-rate topical comedy farce ... The story itself is a flimsy affair, but it is so rich in witty dialogue and in comedy incidents that one is kept laughing all the time.&quot;

While quite popular, according to one source the film actually recorded a loss of $225,000 during its initial theatrical release.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs ‚Äì #72

==Promotion==
As a promotion for the film, the studio built 73 &quot;dream houses&quot; in various locations in the United States, selling some of them by raffle; over 60 were equipped by General Electric. Thousands lined up in front of the house that was built in Ottawa Hills, Ohio, paying admission to view it at its opening.

In Phoenix, Arizona, the dream house was a ranch house built by P.W. Womack Construction Company in a central city development called BelAir (now part of Encanto Village). The dream house built in Rocky Mount, North Carolina still stands at 1515 Lafayette Avenue. In Greensboro, North Carolina, the house was built in the Starmount Forest community.

The home that was built in Omaha, Nebraska still stands. It is located at 502 North 72nd Ave and retains the original look even today. Approximately 30,000 people toured the home before it was raffled off.

==Related works==
The story behind the film began as an April 1946 article written by Eric Hodgins for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. It was reprinted in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and (in condensed form) in &quot;Life&quot; before being published as a novel.

A half-hour radio adaptation of the movie was broadcast on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; on July 1, 1949. Grant reprised his role as Jim Blandings, and Frances Robinson played his wife Muriel. On October 10, 1949 CBS&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented a one-hour adaptation, with Irene Dunne as Muriel. &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; gave a second performance of its half-hour version on June 9, 1950, this time with Grant&#x27;s wife Betsy Drake as Muriel.

On January 21, 1951, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Blandings&quot;, a weekly comedy radio series starring Cary Grant and Betsy Drake, premiered on NBC. Sponsored by Trans-World Airlines, it followed the adventures of the Blandings family after their move into their dream house.

An episode of the 1950s television anthology series &quot;Stage 7&quot;, titled &quot;The Hayfield&quot;, aired on September 18, 1955, and was based on the &quot;Blandings&quot; characters. The episode was a television pilot produced by Four Star Productions for a planned but ultimately unproduced weekly series, &quot;Blandings&#x27; Way&quot;. Macdonald Carey and Phyllis Thaxter played the Blandings in this version. In the episode, Mr. Blandings attempts to clear a hayfield on his property by burning it off, with predictably disastrous results.

In the late 1950s, Screen Gems Productions also proposed &quot;The Blandings&quot;, a weekly TV series featuring the family. Robert Rockwell was considered for the lead, but the pilot featured Steve Dunne instead, with Maggie Hayes. The series was never produced, but the pilot ran on April 27, 1959 as an episode of &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot; titled &quot;A Light in the Fruit Closet&quot;.

==Buildings==
The house built for the 1948 film still stands, on the old Fox Ranch property in Malibu Creek State Park, in the hills a few miles north of Malibu. It is used as the park&#x27;s office, and as offices for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;la.curbed/2018/woolsey-fire-list&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a promotion for the film, RKO built 73 replica houses around the US, such as Spokane in Washington;&lt;ref name=&quot;historylink/9031&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hartford, Bridgeport, Trumbull and Wethersfield in Connecticut; Warwick in Rhode Island; Worcester, Natick, Newton and Springfield in Massachusetts; and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. They were sold by raffle contests and other methods, with General Electric.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertabalos/blanding-dream-house&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bellaonline/176303&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jhgraham/blandings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, after seeing the film at a local theater, dentist Luther Werner Fetter and his wife Mary purchased the plans for the house from RKO, which produced the film, and built a complete replica of it on Mt. Joy Street in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. They moved into the house that Christmas. After Mary Fetter died in an automobile accident in 1960, Dr. Fetter remained the house&#x27;s sole occupant until his death in 2002.

In real life, the family of the author, Eric Hodgins, built their house in the Litchfield County town of New Milford, Connecticut. In 1945, Hodgins sold, for $38,000, to John Allard, a retired Air Force general.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1975/blandings-epilogue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, for $40,000, Ralph Gulliver, a New Milford fuel dealer, bought the property. In 1972, his son, Jack and Jill Gulliver lived there. It was sold in 1980 for an undisclosed amount,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1992/05/24/blandings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 2004 for $1.2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;newenglandhistoricalsociety/blandings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Reinier Lambertus &quot;Ren√©&quot; van de Kerkhof (; born 16 September 1951) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a right winger for FC Twente, PSV Eindhoven and the Netherlands national team.

==Career==
Van de Kerkhof and his twin brother Willy were squad members of the Dutch national team that made the World Cup final in 1974 and became key players in the team that made the 1978 final, losing to hosts West Germany and Argentina, respectively. He also played for the Netherlands at the Euro 1976 and Euro 1980. Overall, van de Kerkhof appeared 47 times for his country, scoring five goals.

He is well remembered due to the incident before the 1978 World Cup final, when the opponent Argentina national team objected to the cast he wore on his injured forearm since it could have injured an Argentinian player. Despite the bandage having been passed by FIFA and worn in previous matches, the referee, Italian Sergio Gonella vacillated. The Dutch players threatened to walk off the field in protest, delaying the kickoff of the game. Finally an extra layer of padding was applied to the bandage as a solution, and the match could start.

1978 was his most successful year, besides becoming runners-up at the World Cup, he also won the UEFA Cup, the Dutch championship and the KNVB Beker with PSV that year: &quot;we had won everything possible ‚Äì the title, the Dutch Cup and the UEFA Cup, and we had five or six players who had been runners-up at the FIFA World Cup in Argentina with the Netherlands. It was a beautiful period under coach Kees Rijvers&quot;, van de Kerkhof later would tell to Berend Scholten.

Van de Kerkhof was named by Pel√© as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.
