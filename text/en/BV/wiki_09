<text>Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of Spider-Man. Directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story conceived by Michael Chabon and the writing team of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, the film was produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Enterprises and Laura Ziskin Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the second installment in Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy and the sequel to &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002). The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and Donna Murphy. Peter Parker fights to stop scientist Dr. Otto Octavius from recreating a dangerous experiment, while also dealing with a personal crisis. 

Principal photography began in April 2003 in New York City and also took place in Los Angeles. Reshoots took place later that year and concluded in December. Danny Elfman returned to compose the score.

&quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theater in Los Angeles on June 25, 2004, and was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on June 30. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional weight and visual effects, as well as Maguire and Molina&#x27;s performances and Raimi&#x27;s direction, and grossed $795.9 million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of the year. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the top 10 films of 2004.

The film won Best Visual Effects at the 77th Academy Awards, and was also nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing; it also received five awards at the Saturn Awards, including Best Fantasy Film and Best Director. The film is widely regarded as one of the greatest superhero films ever made, and serves as a blueprint for future movies in the genre. Its success led to &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) explored the concept of the multiverse to connect the previous &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films to the MCU, with Maguire and Molina reprising their roles.

==Plot==

Two years after Norman Osborn&#x27;s death, Peter Parker struggles professionally and personally because of his commitments as Spider-Man. Peter juggles multiple jobs and faces overdue rent and schoolwork as his Aunt May is being evicted. &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; owner J. Jonah Jameson slanders Spider-Man in the paper, and Peter&#x27;s best friend, Harry Osborn, blames Spider-Man for his father&#x27;s death and resents Peter for not revealing his identity. To protect her from his enemies, Peter has distanced himself from Mary Jane Watson, despite their unspoken romantic feelings. Tired of Peter&#x27;s secrets, Mary Jane agrees to marry Jameson&#x27;s son John.

Harry uses OsCorp to fund the development of a fusion power machine by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. During a public demonstration, Octavius wears a harness with four powerful mechanical tentacles controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with the machine. Though initially successful, the fusion reaction destabilizes, threatening mass destruction, but Octavius refuses to shut down the machine. Before Peter can cut the power, the power surges kill Octavius&#x27; wife, fuse the harness to his body, and destroys the inhibitor chip restricting the tentacles&#x27; AI. Octavius is taken to a hospital where doctors attempt to surgically remove the harness, but the tentacles violently defend themselves. He flees to a decrepit harbor warehouse, where the tentacles corrupt his mind and convince him to rebuild the machine to prove it works. Octavius robs a bank to fund his plan and takes May hostage, but Peter rescues her.

Overwhelmed by stress, exhaustion, and his conflict between wanting a normal life and his responsibilities as Spider-Man, Peter&#x27;s powers begin to fade. He gives up being Spider-Man and rejects his late Uncle Ben&#x27;s wish for him to use his powers responsibly. Embracing civilian life, Peter excels at university and sees Mary Jane perform in an off-Broadway play, much to her delight. However, she rejects his romantic intentions, unable to accept that he has changed. Peter also confesses his responsibility in Ben&#x27;s death to May to assuage her guilt; though initially shocked, she forgives him. Despite his lost powers, Peter later saves a child from a burning building, but another person dies. Believing he could have saved them both as Spider-Man, Peter concludes that his responsibilities as Spider-Man outweigh his personal happiness.

Octavius completes his enhanced machine and confronts Harry, demanding the rare isotope tritium to fuel it. Harry agrees in exchange for Octavius bringing him Spider-Man, instructing Octavius to use Peter to find him. Realizing she does not love John, Mary Jane meets with Peter to confess her feelings, but he lies that he does not reciprocate. Octavius attacks the pair and kidnaps Mary Jane to coerce Peter into finding Spider-Man. Peter&#x27;s powers fully return, and as Spider-Man, he fights Octavius atop a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the train, forcing Peter to use all his strength to stop the runaway vehicle from plunging into the New York Harbor. Despite the passengers&#x27; efforts to protect him, Octavius captures the weakened Peter and delivers him to Harry.

Harry unmasks Spider-Man, discovering Peter&#x27;s true identity. Peter persuades Harry to help him save Mary Jane, leading him to Octavius&#x27; lair. The larger fusion reaction destabilizes again and Peter unmasks himself to convince Octavius to resist the tentacles&#x27; influence and help him. Octavius, acknowledging his folly, sacrifices himself to drown the machine in the bay. Peter rescues Mary Jane, who now knows his secret, and admits that while he loves her, he cannot be with her. Meanwhile, Harry sees a vision in a mirror of Norman demanding vengeance. Harry refuses to hurt Peter and shatters the mirror, revealing a storeroom of Norman&#x27;s Green Goblin equipment.

On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons the ceremony and runs to Peter&#x27;s apartment, telling him that she chooses to be with him despite the risk. Their kiss is interrupted by police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him to go help as Spider-Man.

==Production==

===Development===
Immediately after finishing &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, director Sam Raimi signed on to direct a sequel. In April 2002, Sony hired &quot;Smallville&quot; alumni, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to write a script of the film, as Raimi, Ziskin, and Maguire loved &quot;Smallville&quot;. On May 8, 2002, following &quot;Spider-Man&quot; record-breaking $115¬†million opening weekend, Sony Pictures announced a sequel for 2004. Entitled &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, after the character&#x27;s main comic book title, the film was given a budget of $200¬†million and aimed for a release date of May 7, 2004. The following month, David Koepp was added to co-write with Gough and Millar. Koepp originally wanted to do the Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn story and have Gwen to be killed in the middle of the second movie.

In September 2002, Michael Chabon was hired to rewrite. His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes infatuated with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use endorphins to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is the creator of the genetically altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this means when Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man&#x27;s spine to save himself. This leads to an alliance with Harry (a detail which made it into the finished film). Beforehand, Harry and the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; put a $10¬†million price on Spider-Man&#x27;s head, causing the city&#x27;s citizens to turn against him.

Raimi sifted through the previous drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter Alvin Sargent. He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter&#x27;s conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring the positive and negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides that he can be happy as a heroic figure. Raimi said that he took inspiration from &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980) for the story of Peter giving up his responsibilities. Although the story takes some partial influence from Doc Ock&#x27;s debut in 1963 and the 1966 storyline &quot;If This Be My Destiny...!&quot;, the story was mostly inspired by the 1967 storyline &quot;Spider-Man No More!&quot;, specifically &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #50. It was decided that Doctor Octopus would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity, accompanied by the fact that the character had been repeatedly considered as a villain for the first film over the course of its 15-year development. Raimi changed much of the character&#x27;s backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.

===Casting===
When Tobey Maguire signed on to portray Spider-Man in 2000, he was given a three-film contract. After filming &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; in late 2002, a pre-existing back condition that Maguire suffered from was bothering him. Raimi heard that Maguire could be paralyzed if there was an injury in his back. Jake Gyllenhaal was cast to replace Maguire; the two actors so resemble each other that &quot;a source close to Maguire&quot; reportedly said that, had Gyllenhaal taken over the role, &quot;A year from now? The public wouldn&#x27;t know the difference&quot;. Maguire&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s father Ronald Meyer‚Äîhead of Universal Studios‚Äîhelped Maguire regain the role, with a salary of $17¬†million. Maguire underwent tests to make sure if his back was fit for filming. Gyllenhaal would later say in a 2019 interview saying that he was one of several actors considered to replace Maguire. Raimi stated that prior to filming he was concerned that Maguire and Dunst weren&#x27;t going to have the same chemistry, as they had since broken up.

Several actors were considered for the part of Doctor Octopus, including Ed Harris, Chris Cooper, and Christopher Walken; Molina was cast as Octavius in February 2003 and underwent physical training for the role. The reaction to his casting was mixed. Raimi had been impressed by his performance in &quot;Frida&quot; and also felt that his large physical size was true to the comic book character. Molina only briefly discussed the role and was not aware that he was a strong contender. He was a big fan of Marvel Comics and was excited to get the part. Although he was not familiar with Doc Ock, Molina found one element of the comics that he wanted to maintain, the character&#x27;s cruel, sardonic sense of humor.

===Filming===

&quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on the Loop in Chicago during two days in November 2002. The crew acquired a train of 2200 series cars, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock&#x27;s train fight. Members of the film&#x27;s production team acknowledged that the surroundings of where the Chicago subway car was filmed do not correspond to the kinds of routes that present day New York City subway cars travel. Filming was originally slated to start in January 2003, but was pushed back to April so that Maguire could finish &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. Principal photography began on April 12, 2003, in New York City and Chicago. The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles, shooting on sets created by production designer Neil Spisak. After the scare surrounding his back pains, Tobey Maguire relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line &quot;My back, my back&quot; as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers. Raimi said that while filming the scene he yelled at Maguire to get to the edge of the building, but Maguire refused to do it. Even Rosemary Harris took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work. In contrast, Alfred Molina joked that the stunt team would &quot;trick&quot; him into performing a stunt time and again. J. K. Simmons said that while filming the scene where Spider-Man gets his suit back from The &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, when Simmons said &quot;he&#x27;s a thief&quot; his fake-teeth popped out of his mouth.

Filming was put on hiatus for eight weeks, in order to build Doc Ock&#x27;s pier lair. It had been Spisak&#x27;s idea to use a collapsed pier as Ock&#x27;s lair, reflecting an exploded version of the previous lab and representing how Octavius&#x27; life had collapsed and grown more monstrous, evoking the cinema of Fritz Lang and the film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;. Filming then resumed on that set, having taken fifteen weeks to build, occupying Sony&#x27;s Stage 30. It was by long, and high, and a quarter-scale miniature was also built for the finale as it collapses. Reshoots for the film continued until December 2003.

A camera system called the Spydercam was used to allow filmmakers to express more of Spider-Man&#x27;s world view, at times dropping fifty stories and with shot lengths of just over in New York or in Los Angeles. For some shots the camera would shoot at six frames per second for a faster playback increasing the sense of speed. Shots using the Spydercam were pre-planned in digital versions of cities, and the camera&#x27;s movement was controlled with motion control, making it highly cost-effective. The camera system was only used in the previous film for the final shot.

===Visual effects===
Although roughly the same as before, costume designer James Acheson made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man&#x27;s costume. Its colors were made richer and bolder, its spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, its eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and its muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eyepieces, which were easier to remove.

To create Doctor Octopus&#x27; mechanical tentacles, Steve Johnson&#x27;s Edge FX was hired to create a corset, a metal and rubber girdle, a rubber spine and four foam rubber tentacles which were long and altogether weighed . The claws of each tentacle, which were called &quot;death flowers&quot;, were controlled by one puppeteer sitting on a chair. Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina so that they could give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius&#x27; muscle movement. On set, Molina referred to his tentacles as &quot;Larry&quot;, &quot;Harry&quot;, &quot;Moe&quot; and &quot;Flo&quot;, with &quot;Flo&quot; being the top-right tentacle as it was operated by a female grip and performed delicate operations like removing his glasses and lighting his cigar.

Edge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CGI tentacles added in post-production. The CGI versions were scanned straight from the real ones to allow them to appear more realistic. However, using the real versions was always preferred to save money, and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX&#x27;s creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. In some shots where CGI is used, Molina is replaced by a virtual actor possessing the CGI tentacles. Through the use of motion-capture and cyber-scanning, visual effects supervisor Scott Stokdyk and CGI character animation supervisor Anthony LaMolinara were able to create more detailed virtual actors to replace Maguire and Molina in some shots, as well as make them display natural human motion. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius&#x27; body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.

As with the previous film, John Dykstra served as visual effects designer. Dykstra and his crew sought to make the weakest shot of the second movie look as good as the best shot of the first movie. Dykstra not only created the physical appearance of Octavius&#x27; tentacles, but also that of the nuclear reaction that Octavius attempts to carry out in the film. The reaction resembles the sun, complete with solar flares, and poses a threat to its immediate environment through its strong gravitational pull, which can draw surrounding objects directly into it and disintegrate them. As mentioned previously, the film&#x27;s increased budget allowed the reaction to have a significant amount of artistry and reality.

== Music ==
The film was scored by Danny Elfman, composer of the previous film. However, during recording sessions, Elfman had a falling out with director Sam Raimi, saying that composing &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; was a &quot;miserable experience&quot;. Christopher Young (who eventually scored the sequel), Joseph LoDuca, and John Debney did additional scores for the film. They wanted Elfman to do one cue that was from &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, but he couldn&#x27;t get it close to it and he wasn&#x27;t going to imitate Christopher Young, he instead suggested to hire Young, but Young also couldn&#x27;t get it close either, so they instead licensed the cue from &quot;Hellraiser&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The first teaser trailer was released in December 2003, being attached to the screenings of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The next trailer then premiered on April 8, 2004, during &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and in theaters with the release of &quot;The Alamo&quot; the day after.

Promotional partners included Burger King, Dr Pepper, Kraft Foods, Major League Baseball, Kellogg&#x27;s, and Embassy Suites Hotels.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A‚àí&quot; on an A+ to F scale, the same grade earned by the previous film.

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and Mark Caro stated that Alfred Molina was a &quot;pleasingly complex&quot; villain, and the film as a whole &quot;improves upon its predecessor in almost every way.&quot; William Arnold, of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; gave it a positive review, saying, &quot;Forget &quot;Raising Helen&quot; and &quot;The Notebook&quot;, this is the movie summer&#x27;s most touching young romance.&quot; Kenneth Turan, of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, gave the film four stars out of five and concurred with Caro when he stated, &quot;Doc Ock grabs this film with his quartet of sinisterly serpentine mechanical arms and refuses to let go.&quot; Roger Ebert gave &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; four stars out of four, calling it &quot;the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with &quot;Superman&quot; (1978)&quot;, and praising the film for &quot;effortlessly [combining] special effects and a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving.&quot; He later called it the fourth best film of 2004.&quot; Joe Baltake, of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; gave the film a scoring of four out of four, calling it &quot;the closest thing to an art-house action film since Tim Burton&#x27;s original &quot;Batman&quot; in 1989.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; Richard George felt &quot;Sam Raimi and his writing team delivered an iconic, compelling version of Spider-Man&#x27;s classic foe... We almost wish there was a way to retroactively add some of these elements to the original character.&quot; In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film #9 on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals&quot;. Conversely, J. Hoberman, of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, thought the first half of the film was &quot;talky bordering on tiresome&quot;, with the film often stopping to showcase Raimi&#x27;s idea of humor.

==Legacy==

&quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; has frequently been listed among rankings of the best superhero films. The film was placed 411th on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 500 movies list, describing the film as &quot;Bigger and better than its predecessor, with a superior villain in Alfred Molina&#x27;s Doc Ock, and a more confident Raimi sneaking in some of his own trademarks.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes listed the film as one of the essential films of the 2000s. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; described it as &quot;Not just one of the greatest sequels, but one of the best films of the genre, period.&quot; In 2018, Film School Rejects called it &quot;the best summer movie ever&quot; and said that its &quot;emotional and calculated story stands above modern summer flicks&quot; like those of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2019, Al Horner believed the film to be &quot;the definitive superhero movie&quot; that &quot;laid the blueprint for the entire modern superhero genre&quot;. Digital Trends&#x27; David Caballero named &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; the best superhero movie of all time for its 20th anniversary in 2024.

==Accolades==

At the 77th Academy Awards, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; won Best Visual Effects (John Dykstra, Scott Stokdyk, Anthony LaMolinara and John Frazier), and was nominated for Best Sound Mixing (Kevin O&#x27;Connell, Greg P. Russell, Jeffrey J. Haboush and Joseph Geisinger) and Best Sound Editing along with &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, but lost to &quot;Ray&quot; and &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, respectively. The film won Saturn Awards for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Fantasy Film, Best Special Effects, and Best Writer, while being nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Music. It was nominated for two British Academy Film Awards for Special Visual Effects and Sound, but lost to &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, respectively. The American Film Institute (AFI) listed the film as one of the 2004&#x27;s ten best films.

== Future ==

In March 2004, three months before &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; release, Sony announced that a sequel was already in development. &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was released on May 4, 2007.

In 2021, Molina was announced to return as Doctor Octopus in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), which is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and directed by Jon Watts. Molina later clarified in April that the character would be the same iteration as depicted in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and his story arc would continue directly from the film&#x27;s ending.

==Video game==

To coincide with the film&#x27;s release, a video game of the same name was released for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox on June 28, 2004. Releases on the PlayStation Portable, N-Gage, and Nintendo DS systems would follow. An action-adventure video game, it serves as a sequel to the &quot;Spider-Man: The Movie&quot; (2002). Published by Activision, the console versions were developed by Treyarch, but the other versions had different developers. The console versions and handheld versions of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; were well received, with the exception of the PC/Mac version. Upon launch, the game had shipped more than 2million units in North America by July 7, 2004.

<doc id="612057" wikidata="Q761414" url="?curid=612057" title="Potential well">
<text>A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to do due to entropy.

==Overview==
Energy may be released from a potential well if sufficient energy is added to the system such that the local maximum is surmounted. In quantum physics, potential energy may escape a potential well without added energy due to the probabilistic characteristics of quantum particles; in these cases a particle may be imagined to tunnel &quot;through&quot; the walls of a potential well.

The graph of a 2D potential energy function is a potential energy surface that can be imagined as the Earth&#x27;s surface in a landscape of hills and valleys. Then a potential well would be a valley surrounded on all sides with higher terrain, which thus could be filled with water (e.g., be a lake) without any water flowing away toward another, lower minimum (e.g. sea level).

In the case of gravity, the region around a mass is a gravitational potential well, unless the density of the mass is so low that tidal forces from other masses are greater than the gravity of the body itself.

A potential hill is the opposite of a potential well, and is the region surrounding a local maximum.

==Quantum confinement==

Quantum confinement can be observed once the diameter of a material is of the same magnitude as the de Broglie wavelength of the electron wave function. When materials are this small, their electronic and optical properties deviate substantially from those of bulk materials.

A particle behaves as if it were free when the confining dimension is large compared to the wavelength of the particle. During this state, the bandgap remains at its original energy due to a continuous energy state. However, as the confining dimension decreases and reaches a certain limit, typically in nanoscale, the energy spectrum becomes discrete. As a result, the bandgap becomes size-dependent. As the size of the particles decreases, the electrons and electron holes come closer, and the energy required to activate them increases, which ultimately results in a blueshift in light emission.

Specifically, the effect describes the phenomenon resulting from electrons and electron holes being squeezed into a dimension that approaches a critical quantum measurement, called the exciton Bohr radius. In current application, a quantum dot such as a small sphere confines in three dimensions, a quantum wire confines in two dimensions, and a quantum well confines only in one dimension. These are also known as zero-, one- and two-dimensional potential wells, respectively. In these cases they refer to the number of dimensions in which a confined particle can act as a free carrier. See external links, below, for application examples in biotechnology and solar cell technology.

===Quantum mechanics view===
The electronic and optical properties of materials are affected by size and shape. Well-established technical achievements including quantum dots were derived from size manipulation and investigation for their theoretical corroboration on quantum confinement effect. The major part of the theory is the behaviour of the exciton resembles that of an atom as its surrounding space shortens. A rather good approximation of an exciton&#x27;s behaviour is the 3-D model of a particle in a box. The solution of this problem provides a sole mathematical connection between energy states and the dimension of space. Decreasing the volume or the dimensions of the available space, increases the energy of the states. Shown in the diagram is the change in electron energy level and bandgap between nanomaterial and its bulk state.

The following equation shows the relationship between energy level and dimension spacing:

:formula_1

:formula_2

Research results provide an alternative explanation of the shift of properties at nanoscale. In the bulk phase, the surfaces appear to control some of the macroscopically observed properties. However, in nanoparticles, surface molecules do not obey the expected configuration in space. As a result, surface tension changes tremendously.

===Classical mechanics view===
The Young‚ÄìLaplace equation can give a background on the investigation of the scale of forces applied to the surface molecules:

:formula_3

Under the assumption of spherical shape formula_4 and resolving the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation for the new radii formula_5 (nm), we estimate the new formula_6(GPa). The smaller the radii, the greater the pressure is present. The increase in pressure at the nanoscale results in strong forces toward the interior of the particle. Consequently, the molecular structure of the particle appears to be different from the bulk mode, especially at the surface. These abnormalities at the surface are responsible for changes of inter-atomic interactions and bandgap.

<text>The &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year are cricketers selected for the honour by the annual publication &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, based &quot;primarily for their influence on the previous English season&quot;. The award began in 1889 with the naming of &quot;Six Great Bowlers of the Year&quot;, and continued with the naming of &quot;Nine Great Batsmen of the Year&quot; in 1890 and &quot;6 Great Wicket-Keepers&quot; in 1891.

Since 1897, with a few notable exceptions, the annual award has recognised five players of the year. No players were named in 1916 or 1917, as the First World War prevented any first-class cricket being played in England, while in 1918 and 1919 the recipients were five schoolboy cricketers. From 1941 to 1946, the Second World War caused the same issue and no players were named. Three players have been sole recipients: W. G. Grace (1896), Plum Warner (1921) and Jack Hobbs (1926). The latter two selections are the only exceptions to the rule that a player may receive the award only once. Hobbs was first recognised in 1909, but was selected a second time in 1926 to honour his breaking W. G. Grace&#x27;s record of 126 first-class hundreds; Warner was first honoured in 1904, but received a second award in 1921 for his last season in first-class cricket, when he led Middlesex to a County Championship win. John Wisden, cricketer and eponymous founder of the almanack, was featured in a special commemorative section in the Jubilee edition of the publication in 1913, 29 years posthumously.

From 2000 to 2003 the award was made based on players&#x27; impact on cricket worldwide rather than just the preceding season in England, but the decision was reversed in 2004 with the introduction of a separate Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World award.

The oldest surviving recipient of the award is Neil Harvey (1954), which he became in February 2022 with the death of Sonny Ramadhin. The longest that a recipient has lived after receiving the award is 77 years by Harry Calder (1918), who died in 1995. Calder, however, uniquely for a male recipient, played no first-class cricket. Among first-class players, the longest-lived after receipt of the award is 74 years by Wilfred Rhodes (1899).

Ten women have been chosen: Claire Taylor (2009), Charlotte Edwards (2014), Heather Knight (2018), Natalie Sciver (2018), Anya Shrubsole (2018), Tammy Beaumont (2019), Ellyse Perry (2020), Dane van Niekerk (2022), Harmanpreet Kaur (2023), and Ashleigh Gardner (2024).

<doc id="612068" wikidata="Q296028" url="?curid=612068" title="Alfred Molina">
<text>Alfred Molina (born Alfredo Molina; 24 May 1953) is a British and American actor. He is known for his leading roles and character actor roles on the stage and screen. In a career spanning over five decades he has received a Drama Desk Award as well as nominations for two British Academy Film Awards, a British Independent Film Award, an Independent Spirit Award, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Tony Awards.

He first rose to prominence in the West End, earning a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Newcomer in a Play for his performance in the production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1980. He received Tony Award nominations for his roles on Broadway playing Yvan in &quot;Art&quot; (1998), Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (2004), and Mark Rothko in &quot;Red&quot; (2009). He returned to Broadway playing Professor Serebryakov in a revival of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (2024).

On film, he made his debut as Satipo in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). He went on to receive two BAFTA Award nominations for his roles as Diego Rivera in &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), and Jack Mellor in &quot;An Education&quot; (2009). His other notable films include &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), &quot;Luther&quot; (2003), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), and &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; (2014). He has voiced characters in &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), &quot;Monsters University&quot; (2013), &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018), and &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019). He is also known for his portrayal of Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

On television, Molina has received two nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for his roles as Ben Weeks in the HBO movie &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; (2014), and Robert Aldrich in the FX miniseries &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot; (2017). His other notable television credits include &quot;Meantime&quot; (1983), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (2001), and &quot;Three Pines&quot; (2022).

== Early life and education ==
He was born Alfredo Molina in the Paddington district of London. His parents were both immigrants: his Spanish father ‚Äîfrom Murcia‚Äî was a waiter who had parachuted into France with SOE before D-Day, and his Italian mother worked as a cleaner.

Molina grew up in a working-class district in Notting Hill that was inhabited by many other immigrant families. He attended Cardinal Manning secondary modern Roman Catholic school there. He decided to become an actor after seeing &quot;Spartacus&quot; at the age of nine, and attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, as well as auditioning for and becoming a member of the National Youth Theatre. Molina admitted in May 2024 that his father was disappointed in him for pursuing a career in acting.

At the age of 21, he changed his name to Alfred, at the urging of his first agent.

==Career==
===1978‚Äì1989: Early work ===
Molina appeared with Leonard Rossiter in the sitcom &quot;The Losers&quot; (1978). He made his film debut with a minor role alongside Harrison Ford in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) as Indiana Jones&#x27; ill-fated but traitorous guide, Satipo, during its iconic opening sequence. Molina stated in an interview in 2013 that he owes his stage and film career to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series. &quot;I&#x27;m very, very proud of that, I have to admit I didn&#x27;t think at the time, &#x27;Oh, this is going to go down in movie history.&#x27; I&#x27;d never been in front of a camera before,&quot; Molina said about his short but memorable appearance in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. He recalled getting the job as a &quot;gift from God&quot; and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve publicly thanked Steven many, many times. That job saved my bacon, in more ways than one.&quot; About his now-famous line in the film, Molina stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with people coming up to me about it. They&#x27;ll shout that line to me, &#x27;Throw me the idol, I&#x27;ll throw you the whip!&#x27; I&#x27;m delighted that people still remember it.&quot;

However, his big break came with &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; (1985), which he followed with a starring role in &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), playing Joe Orton&#x27;s lover (and eventual murderer) Kenneth Halliwell. He was originally cast as Arnold Rimmer in the TV sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, but was replaced by Chris Barrie.

===1990‚Äì1999: Broadway debut and acclaim ===
In the early 1990s, Molina was a ubiquitous presence on British television, with his highest profile role being the lead in the first two series of &quot;El C.I.D.&quot;. He appeared in the critically acclaimed films such as Mike Newell&#x27;s costume drama &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992), Richard Donner&#x27;s western comedy &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), and Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s western &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995). Subsequent film roles include the drama &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; (1991), the science fiction horror film &quot;Species&quot; (1995), the broad comedy &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; (1999). With a midwestern American accent, Molina starred alongside Betty White in the US television series &quot;Ladies Man&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2001. In 1993 he appeared in the BBC miniseries adaptation of &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;, playing the annoying Tony, along with John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. In 1995, Molina starred with Marisa Tomei in &quot;The Perez Family&quot;, playing Cuban refugees who pretend to be married so they can more easily stay in America. Marjorie Baumgarten praised Molina as attaining &quot;the right mixture of gentle honor and baffled stupefaction&quot; to portray his character, although Peter Rainer of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Molina &quot;so intensely sodden that he&#x27;s like a great big scowling dark cloud.&quot; Molina has worked twice with Paul Thomas Anderson, first in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) and then in &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999).

===2000‚Äì2009: Established actor ===
In 2000, Molina appeared in Lasse Hallstr√∂m&#x27;s &quot;Chocolat&quot; which received critical acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination. He gained wide recognition for his portrayal of Diego Rivera alongside Salma Hayek in the biopic &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), a role for which he gained BAFTA and SAG award nominations. He played himself alongside Steve Coogan in Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; (2003) and gained further commercial recognition when he portrayed Johann Tetzel in &quot;Luther&quot; (2003) and Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004), which became one of the highest-grossing films of that year. For the latter, Molina was nominated for a Satellite Award as Best Supporting Actor. He reprised his role in the video game adaptation. In 2006, Molina portrayed Touchstone in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; and appeared in Ron Howard&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Molina provided the voice of the villain Ares in the 2009 animated film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

Molina&#x27;s stage work has included two major Royal National Theatre productions, Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (as Shannon) and David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot; (as Fox). In his Broadway debut, Molina performed in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s Tony Award-winning play &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot;, for which he received a Tony nomination in 1998. In 2004, Molina returned to the stage, starring as Tevye in the Broadway production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. For his performance he once again received a Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Actor in a Musical. He received his third Tony Award nomination for &quot;Red&quot; in 2010, for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.

In 2010, Molina starred opposite Dawn French in the six-part BBC sitcom &quot;Roger &amp; Val Have Just Got In&quot;, with a second series in 2012.

Molina has three Lego Minifigures modelled after him, namely Doctor Octopus from &quot;Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, Satipo from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; and Sheik Amar from &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;.

<text>Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation (PTS Foundation/Public Television Service Foundation, ), also called Public Television Service (PTS, ), is the first independent public broadcasting institution in Taiwan, which broadcasts the Public Television Service Taiwan. Although first proposed in 1980, it was not until 1984 that the executive-level Government Information Office (GIO), which regulates mass media activities and serves as the government press bureau, attempted to create a separate entity that would produce public interest programs for broadcast on the then-existing three terrestrial networks. Nevertheless, the Executive Yuan (one of Taiwan&#x27;s five branches of government or &quot;yuans&quot;, and the one responsible for the GIO) later shifted the responsibility to the preexisting Chinese Public Television Broadcasting Development Fund. It was not until the early 1990s, following the lifting of martial law, that legislative efforts striving to create a public television station emerged in earnest. After much political wrangling and outcries over public and private resources used in lobbying and advocacy efforts, the final statutes creating PTS were enacted in 1997.

==A Part of TBS==
Taiwan PTS is operated by the Public Television Service Foundation, which is a nonprofit, as an independent public service broadcaster.

===History===
In 2006, The Legislative Yuan completed the third reading and approved the Statute Regarding the Disposition of Government Shareholdings in the Terrestrial Television Industry, paving the road for Taiwan Broadcasting System (TBS). After Liming Foundation donated Chinese Television System (CTS) shares to the PTS Foundation, TBS was formed as a result. In 2007, Taiwan Indigenous Television (TITV), Hakka TV, and Taiwan Macroview Television (MACTV) join Taiwan Broadcasting System, completed the structure of TBS.

In 2020 the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture announced that they would be providing PTS with funding to produce English language programming. The following year, PTS launched &quot;PTS World Taiwan&quot; as &quot;an international YouTube channel that offers an incredible variety of programmes for viewers worldwide&quot;; the channel features content mainly in Mandarin and Taiwanese with English subtitles.

<doc id="612077" wikidata="Q4651794" url="?curid=612077" title="AI.24 Foxhunter">
<text>The AI.24 Foxhunter was an aircraft interception (AI) radar carried by the Panavia Tornado ADV fighter aircraft (known as the Tornado F3 in Royal Air Force service), which gave it an all-weather, day-and-night, beyond-visual-range engagement capability.

==Production==
The radar was manufactured by GEC-Marconi subsidiaries and other partners, with major parts from Ferranti. 
Despite initial problems, (the radar was several years late and 60 per cent over budget) successive upgrades constantly improved the RAF&#x27;s Tornado F3 fleet.

==Development==
Much of the radar system and related operational software was developed at the Radar Research Laboratory of GEC-Marconi Elliott Avionic Systems Ltd., initially at the Elliott Automation plant in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and latterly (from 1981 to 2004) as Marconi Avionics at the (formerly the Xerox site of a matrix of interconnected grey portacabins and a few factory units) facility on Monks Way, Linford Wood, Milton Keynes. This site has changed completely in the years since, but there is now a Foxhunter Drive starting where the high security gate was.

==History==
The radar was flight tested on a Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer and first flew in a Tornado F.2 in June 1981.

===Contractual relationships===
In 1987 GEC argued that the contractual relationships were partly to blame for the delay in the Foxhunter entering service ‚Äì although GEC was responsible for most of the radar, Ferranti manufactured the antenna platform (the scanner less the antenna) and transmitter and reported to the Ministry of Defence who acted as the prime contactor. A new contract was signed in March 1988 and described as &quot;tight&quot; (i.e. not lenient towards Marconi) by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

===Production delays===
Production Tornado F.2s had concrete ballast in place of the Foxhunter radar, due to the development delays. This ballast became known as the &quot;Blue Circle radar&quot;, a play on words from a British brand of cement by the same name, and the Rainbow Codes previously used for British radars.

The UK&#x27;s Tornado F3 fleet were ultimately equipped with &quot;Stage 3 AI.24s&quot;.

<doc id="612078" wikidata="Q3473989" url="?curid=612078" title="Goble, Oregon">
<text>Goble is an unincorporated community in Columbia County, Oregon, United States. It is located on U.S. Route 30 and the Columbia River.

==History==
The Goble area was most likely a stop for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Goble was first settled by Daniel B. Goble in 1853. He took up a donation land claim and later sold it to George S. Foster, who laid out a town and named it after Goble. Until there was a railroad bridge built across the Columbia River at Vancouver, Washington, Goble was the Oregon terminus for the train ferry to Kalama, Washington. Goble had a post office from 1894 to 1960.
The history of the area is complicated because there are at five or six different community names applied to at least three locations in close proximity to each other all dating to about the same era. These names include: Hunters, Reuben, Goble, Mooreville, Red Town, Enterprise aka Enterprise Landing, and arguably Beaver Homes.
The history of the area begins with the selection of Kalama, Washington, as the beginning point for the construction of the Pacific Division of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1870. At least by 1879, there was a landing on the Oregon side of the Columbia River across from Kalama known as Enterprise Landing. Reuben was a post office name assigned to the location when a post office was sought in 1890 and it was found that the name Enterprise was already taken. The physical location is given to be about a mile south of the present day Goble. Reuben was named for the brother of the first postmaster, Reuben R. Foster. 
Scheduled Rail service of the Northern Pacific Railway from Tacoma to Kalama began on January¬†5, 1874. It connected to regular riverboat traffic on the Columbia River. However the Northern Pacific Railroad was chartered to construct transcontinental railroad and telegraph lines between Lake Superior and Puget Sound and completing the connection required a Portland to Kalama route. In 1877, Oregon Senator John Mitchell sponsored legislation calling for the Northern Pacific to forfeit of land grants unless they completed a line to Kalama &quot;as far as practicable along the Oregon side of the Columbia River&quot;. The bill didn&#x27;t pass congress, but on September¬†8, 1883, the Last spike was driven at Gold Creek, Montana to close the gap in the Rocky Mountain Division section of the Northern Pacific Railroad. A special train celebrating the opening of the transcontinental line arrived in Tacoma on September¬†13, 1883, which had traveled over the Portland-Hunters line. The Train Ferry Tacoma would go in service the following year.

Hunters, being the railroad ferry site, was also the site of the first post office in the area called &quot;Hunters&quot;, which was established May¬†29, 1888. Hunters was a location about two miles (3¬†km) south of present-day Goble, and was soon abandoned by the Northern Pacific Railroad in favor of a new ferry slip at Goble. There is no good record of when the move was made, but the Hunters post office was closed to Reuben in October 1893, and Goble was platted in 1891.

==Train ferry==
Before there was a railroad bridge between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington, Goble was the site of an important train ferry.
The Northern Pacific Railroad had built a railroad on the Oregon side of the Columbia River to Goble. In the 1880s, the company bought the second largest ferry in the world and shipped it to Oregon.
In order to ship the ferry, crews disassembled it into 57,159 pieces and shipped it around Cape Horn. The ferry, named &quot;The Tacoma&quot;, was reassembled in Portland and it transported trains across the Columbia first from Hunters and later from Goble to Kalama, Washington from 1884 until 1908.

==Economy==

In the 1890s, Goble was a boomtown, supported by logging, the wood-fired Columbia River steamboats that stopped there for refueling, and as many as six trains that stopped in the community daily on the way to Seattle.

Today there are few businesses remaining in Goble, but the Goble Tavern remains open.

While Rainier is most often cited as the home of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, it is actually closer to Goble and Prescott.

==Points of interest==
Goble is home to the Goble Caves and other unique geological formations that produce rare crystals.
Two types of Zeolite, called Tschernichite and Boggsite, were first discovered in Goble.

Deer Island, an uninhabited Columbia River island where Lewis and Clark stopped in 1805 and 1806, lies in the Columbia River upstream from Goble. The community of Deer Island is nearby on the Oregon side of the mainland.

<doc id="612079" wikidata="Q304216" url="?curid=612079" title="Stipule">
<text>In botany, a stipule is an outgrowth typically borne on both sides (sometimes on just one side) of the base of a leafstalk (the petiole). They are primarily found among dicots and rare among monocots. Stipules are considered part of the anatomy of the leaf of a typical flowering plant, although in many species they may be inconspicuous ‚Äîor sometimes entirely absent, and the leaf is then termed exstipulate. At the other end of the scale are species like &quot;Artocarpus elasticus&quot; where the stipules can be up to eight inches (twenty cm) in length. (In some older botanical writing, the term &quot;stipule&quot; was used more generally to refer to any small leaves or leaf-parts, notably prophylls.) The word &quot;stipule&quot; was coined by Linnaeus from Latin &quot;stipula&quot;, straw, stalk.

==Types of stipules==


== General characteristics ==
The position of stipules on a plant varies widely from species to species, though they are often located near the base of a leaf. Stipules are most common on dicotyledons, where they appear in pairs alongside each leaf. Some monocotyledon plants display stipule-like structures, but only display one per leaf. A relationship exists between the anatomy of the stem node and the presence or absence of stipules: most plants with &quot;trilacunar&quot; nodes have stipules; species with &quot;unilacunar&quot; nodes lack stipules.

Stipules are morphologically variable and might appear as glands, scales, hairs, spines, or laminar (leaf-like) structures.

If a single stipule goes all the way around the stem, it is known as an ochrea.

== Types ==
=== According to duration ===
The three types of stipules according to duration are caducous, deciduous and persistent. Caducous stipules fall off before the leaf unfolds, while deciduous stipules fall off immediately after the leaf unfolds. Persistent stipules remain attached to the plant.

=== According to shape, size and position ===
Stipules can be considered free lateral, adnate, interpetiolar, intrapetiolar, ochreate, foliaceous, bud scales, tendrillar or spiny.

A stipule can be fused to the stem, or to the other stipule from the same node.

A stipule is &quot;adnate&quot; if it&#x27;s fused together on part of the petiole length, but the anterior is still free.

A stipule is &quot;interpetiolar&quot; if it is located in between the petioles, as opposed to being attached to the petioles, and generally one stipule from each leaf is fused together, so it appears that there&#x27;s just one stipule between each leaf.

A stipule is &quot;intrapetiolar&quot; if it is located in the angle that is between a stem and a petiole. In this case, the two stipules generally form together and appear to be one stipule.

A stipule is &quot;ochreate&quot; if a single stipule appears to be a solid tube that goes all the way around the stem.

A stipule is &quot;foliaceous&quot; if it is leaf-like. These are generally used to photosynthesize.

A stipule is considered a &quot;bud scale&quot; if it is hard or scaly and protects leaf buds as they form. These generally fall off as soon as the leaf unfolds.

A stipule is considered &quot;tendrillar&quot; if they are long thin tendrils, and are generally used by climbing plants.

A stipule is considered &quot;spiny&quot; if they are long and pointy. These are generally used to deter animals.

A stipule is considered to be &quot;abaxial&quot;, &quot;counter&quot; or &quot;leaf opposed&quot; if it is located on the opposite side to where the leaf meets the stem.

== Purpose of stipules ==
Stipules have various functions. Some stipules are not well understood or may be vestigial.

It is known that foliaceous stipules are used like leaves to make energy for the plants. Sometimes stipules protect the next leaf or bud as it grows in then falls off after the leaf unfolds, as with Tulip Poplars. Stipules can be used as climbing tendrils by climbing plants. Spiny stipules can be used to help protect the plant from animals.

<doc id="612081" wikidata="Q1758193" url="?curid=612081" title="Xiu Xiu">
<text>Xiu Xiu ( ) is an American experimental rock band, formed in 2002 by singer-songwriter Jamie Stewart in San Jose, California. Currently, the line-up consists of multi-instrumentalists Stewart (the only constant member since formation), Angela Seo, and percussionist David Kendrick. The band&#x27;s name comes from the Chinese film &quot;Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl&quot;, which has influenced the sound of their music, according to Stewart.

Xiu Xiu released their first two albums, &quot;Knife Play&quot; (2002) and &quot;A Promise&quot; (2003), on 5 Rue Christine to positive critical reception. In-between the two, the EP &quot;Chapel of the Chimes&quot; was released via Absolutely Kosher. The compilation album &quot;Fag Patrol&quot; was released shortly after, and their third studio album &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; was released in 2004. &quot;La For√™t&quot; was released in 2005 after Caralee McElroy joined the group, and &quot;The Air Force&quot; followed in 2006. 2008&#x27;s &quot;Women as Lovers&quot; was released via the main Kill Rock Stars label in 2008, and McElroy departed the group shortly afterwards.

&quot;Dear God, I Hate Myself&quot; was released in 2010 and was the first Xiu Xiu album to prominently feature longtime member Angela Seo. Following a signing to Polyvinyl and Bella Union, Xiu Xiu released &quot;Always&quot; (2012) and &quot;Angel Guts: Red Classroom&quot; (2014). In between those two projects, the group released a Nina Simone tribute project, &quot;Nina&quot;, in late 2013 via Graveface Records.

&quot;Plays the Music of Twin Peaks&quot; (2016) followed, an album consisting of covers from the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; soundtracks originally as a Record Store Day exclusive release but re-released by Polyvinyl later that year. &quot;Forget&quot; (2017) and &quot;Girl with Basket of Fruit&quot; (2019) were released afterwards, and Xiu Xiu released their twelfth album &quot;Oh No&quot; in 2021. Their thirteenth album, &quot;Ignore Grief&quot;, was released in March 2023, and their fourteenth, &quot;13&quot; Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips&quot;, was released in September 2024.

== History ==

===2002‚Äì2004: Formation and early years===
Jamie Stewart formed Xiu Xiu in 2002 after their previous band, Ten in the Swear Jar, disbanded. Stewart and Cory McCulloch continued from the previous group, and were joined by Yvonne Chen and Lauren Andrews. The band&#x27;s sound was characterized by its use of indigenous instruments and programmed drums in place of traditional rock instruments: harmonium, mandolin, brass bells, gongs, keyboards, and a cross between a guitarr√≥n mexicano and a cello for bass, etc. Stewart states that the group is equally influenced by Nina Simone and Krzysztof Penderecki, by The Birthday Party and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD).

Xiu Xiu would tour their first LP &quot;Knife Play&quot;, and its successor EP, &quot;Chapel of the Chimes&quot;, in 2002, blending both melody and cacophony with a heavy reliance on percussive instrumentation and brass instrumentation.

Following 2002, the group would shrink in membership as Yvonne Chen left to focus on her vegan boutique &quot;Otsu&quot; and self-published magazine &quot;Zum&quot;, while Cory McCulloch also stopped touring, focusing instead on producing the band&#x27;s next two LPs. A personal loss would affect Xiu Xiu as well, as Jamie Stewart&#x27;s father, musician and record producer Michael Stewart was found dead after an apparent suicide. Coping with these losses, Stewart would record the group&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Knife Play&quot;, 2003&#x27;s &quot;A Promise&quot;.

Continuing to focus on the subject matter of Jamie Stewart&#x27;s personal life ‚Äì as witnessed previously by &quot;Knife Play&quot; ‚Äì &quot;A Promise&quot; acts like a concept record of internal despair. Consisting of ten tracks, the record was oriented towards a more or less acoustic presentation, rather than relying on the booming brass and percussion which had worked to make &quot;Knife Play&quot;. However, the record did not veer from the formulated programming for which Stewart and McCulloch would be praised by fans and critics alike. &quot;A Promise&quot; also contains a cover of Tracy Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Fast Car&quot;, a version that has been praised for its stripped sound and Stewart&#x27;s distressing vocals.

During this time, Stewart recorded &quot;Fag Patrol&quot;, a collection of previous recorded material as well as covers of songs by The Smiths and their previous group with McCulloch, Ten in the Swear Jar. Released as a handmade CD by Rob Fisk&#x27;s and Kelly Goodefisk&#x27;s Free Porcupine Society, &quot;Fag Patrol&quot; was limited to only a few hundred copies (however saw a CD repress in 2005, and a vinyl reissue by Improved Sequence in 2021). In the spring of 2004, Stewart and McCulloch released what is considered by many to be the group&#x27;s most accessible album, &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot;. More pop-friendly in its sound than previous releases, &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; boosted Xiu Xiu to new heights in terms of popularity, largely thanks to its single &quot;I Luv the Valley OH!&quot;. The tone of the album reflected an &quot;incredibly, incredibly violent, incredibly jarring, and difficult to take&quot; string of events in Stewart&#x27;s life. Stewart described their lyrics as &quot;never fictional&quot;. They told &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that Xiu Xiu songs are based around five topics: family, politics, sex, love and lovelessness, suicide, and how they are connected.

With the departure of Lauren Andrews in 2003 ‚Äì who wished to focus on her academic studies ‚Äì Stewart was joined on stage by their &quot;long-lost&quot; cousin, Caralee McElroy in 2004. The two would tour relentlessly throughout that year, releasing not only the group&#x27;s third LP, but also split recordings with This Song Is a Mess But So Am I and Bunkbed, along with the &quot;Fleshettes&quot; single ‚Äì which featured a rendition of the Ten in the Swear Jar track &quot;Helsabot&quot; by McElroy.

Seen as a return to Stewart&#x27;s more dark and crabby demeanor, Xiu Xiu&#x27;s fourth album &quot;La For√™t&quot; alluded to a frustration which Stewart had felt throughout the process of recording the 2004 record. Centered around the topic of &quot;horrible times in horrible lives&quot; as well as Stewart&#x27;s personal frustrations with then-U.S. President George W. Bush, &quot;La For√™t&quot; is characterized by an altogether different sound ‚Äì layered by mandolin, harmonium, clarinet, cello, autoharp, and tuba. In addition to &quot;La For√™t&quot;, Xiu Xiu would join Italian experimental group Larsen in forming XXL, which released its first LP, &quot;¬°Cia√ºtistico!&quot;, in 2005, followed later by its successor &quot;¬øSpicchiology?&quot;, in 2007. Stewart also issued formative splits throughout 2005, working with artists such as The Paper Chase, Kill Me Tomorrow, and Devendra Banhart.
In 2006, Stewart would break from tradition by ending their professional relationship with McCulloch. They then started recording with San Francisco-based band Deerhoof&#x27;s drummer Greg Saunier as producer for Xiu Xiu&#x27;s fifth LP entitled &quot;The Air Force&quot;. Saunier, who had previously worked with Stewart on &quot;Knife Play&quot;, created for the record a greater wall of sound ‚Äì a stark contrast to that of McCulloch&#x27;s discordant attitude towards production. &quot;The Air Force&quot; would be supported throughout 2006 by a three piece ensemble, as Stewart and McElroy were joined by drummer/percussionist Ches Smith, who himself had previously worked with the group on &quot;Knife Play&quot;. Produced by Greg Saunier, Stewart said that the album is about &quot;making other people feel bad&quot; instead of feeling bad oneself and the year it was released was &quot;one of the first not dominated by personal tragedies&quot; Its major themes are &quot;guilt and sex as opposed to sorrow and sex&quot;. Stewart considered it their best and most consciously pop album yet. They said that the band was obsessed with Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Blue Album&quot; and The Smiths&#x27;s &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; while on tour, though the album does not reflect those albums particularly. &quot;The Air Force&quot; also contained the band&#x27;s first album-based songs without vocals by Stewart ‚Äì with McElroy singing &quot;Hello From Eau Claire&quot;, as well as the instrumental piece &quot;Saint Pedro Glue Stick&quot;.

A third EP ‚Äì &quot;Tu Mi Piaci&quot; (&quot;I like you&quot;) ‚Äì of songs originally recorded by acts such as Bauhaus, Nedelle, Big Star, The Pussycat Dolls, and Nina Simone was released in 2006, along with a collaboration with ambient artist Grouper, entitled &quot;Creepshow&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Xiu Xiu would record their sixth album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Women as Lovers&quot;. Their longest LP to date, &quot;Women as Lovers&quot; attempts to hone the synth-pop influences of the group&#x27;s sound. Stewart&#x27;s and McElroy&#x27;s duet with Michael Gira of Swans on a cover of David Bowie and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Under Pressure&quot; is representative of this. Touring that year alongside Xiu Xiu aluminist Devra Hoff on bass, the band&#x27;s second four-piece incarnation would not last long, as Hoff abruptly left the group soon after touring began.

In May 2009, it was revealed that Caralee McElroy would no longer work with Xiu Xiu. Speculations ran as to what reasons McElroy had for leaving the group after five years of recording and touring, though no explanation was given other than her subsequent membership in Manhattan-based darkwave group Cold Cave, which she soon after departed from in 2010. With the vacancies left by both Hoff and McElroy, Stewart and Smith recruited Angela Seo in late 2009. Thereafter, the group would begin work on its seventh LP &quot;Dear God, I Hate Myself&quot;, recording in both Oakland, California as well as Durham, North Carolina. Once again shifting motifs, Xiu Xiu would this time choose to experiment with video game-based programming, using the Nintendo DS to write many of the songs which appear on their 2010 release. The music video for the song &quot;Dear God, I Hate Myself&quot; received attention online in 2010. The video consists of Seo inducing vomiting over the course of the three-minute song, culminating with her vomiting on Stewart, who has been eating a chocolate bar during the entire video. Seo and Stewart have defended the video online and in interviews, stating that the video illustrates the subject of the song in an extreme and visceral fashion.

===2010‚Äì2017: &quot;Always&quot; to &quot;FORGET&quot;===

In 2010, Xiu Xiu left Kill Rock Stars and signed with Bella Union and Polyvinyl. Xiu Xiu released &quot;Always&quot; on these new labels in 2012. It was called &quot;magnificent&quot; and given 5 stars by The Independent and given a 9/10 by Drowned in Sound.

In April 2013, Stewart and Eugene Robinson of Oxbow released the collaborative album &quot;Xiu Xiu &amp; Eugene S. Robinson Present: Sal Mineo&quot; on Important Records after having toured Europe together in February to promote the project.
In an email sent to fans on January 28, 2013, Xiu Xiu announced that &quot;Ches Smith, Mary Halvorson, Tim Berne, Tony Malaby, Andrea Parkins and Jamie Stewart just finished recording an album in NYC of free jazz and art song versions of all Nina Simone songs.&quot; The album, &quot;Nina&quot;, was released on Graveface Records on December 3, 2013.

In the same email, Xiu Xiu also announced that a new Xiu Xiu album was being made. Xiu Xiu said that it is possible that it will be named &quot;Angel Guts: Red Classroom&quot; and that &quot;it will be a mean, tight hearted, blackness of Neubauten vs Suicide vs Nico.&quot; Angel Guts: Red Classroom was released February 2014. It was given an 8 out of 10 by Drowned in Sound and Mojo. David Hartley of the band War on Drugs praised the album, calling it a &quot;stereoscopic assault.&quot;

In June 2015, Xiu Xiu started a new Bandcamp page under the title &quot;xiuxiu69&quot;. Since its creation, they have self-described the page as an &quot;ephemera shoppe specializing in exclusive, obscure, out of print, experimental &amp; overlooked zonk.&quot; The page is used to host projects such as non-studio Xiu Xiu releases, solo Jamie Stewart albums, ambient projects, out of print Xiu Xiu collaborations and recordings from Jamie Stewart&#x27;s former band Ten In The Swear Jar. Xiuxiu69 also hosts sales of physical music and merchandise, including LPs of Xiu Xiu material and material loosely related to Xiu Xiu such as Jamie Stewart and Lawrence English&#x27;s band HEXA.

On November 16, 2016, the band announced their next album &quot;FORGET&quot;, set for release on February 24, 2017. The announcement was accompanied with lead single &quot;Wondering&quot;, signifying a return to more pop-oriented songwriting.

=== 2017‚Äì2024: &quot;Girl with Basket of Fruit&quot; to &quot;13&quot; Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips&quot; ===
Xiu Xiu performed a long piece &quot;Deforms the Unborn&quot; based on the demonic possession of children at the Guggenheim Museum in May 2018. The band released their eleventh new album titled &quot;Girl with Basket of Fruit&quot; on February 8, 2019, via Polyvinyl.

In April 2020, Xiu Xiu started a Bandcamp subscription service titled &quot;XIU MUTHA FUCKIN XIU&quot;. At its basic tier, it grants access to a monthly &quot;XIU MUTHA FUCKIN XIU&quot; digital audio package, consisting of a new fully produced cover (notable examples being Xiu Xiu renditions of &quot;Dancing On My Own&quot;, &quot;In The Garage&quot; and &quot;Dancing with a Stranger&quot;), an exclusive solo Xiu Xiu song, and an edition of the 12 chapter 120 part experimental piece &quot;Lamentation&quot;. So far, two chapters of &quot;Lamentation&quot; have been revealed, chapter one being Spider Lamentation and chapter two being Woodpecker Lamentation. Tier two grants all the above and &quot;30 to 50 license free samples, full stems of one Xiu Xiu song for non commercial exploration&quot;. Tier three includes the benefits from tiers one and two and a unique hand-made postcard illustrated by Angela Seo or Jamie Stewart with a haiku written to you and posted on the Xiuxiu69 Bandcamp page.

Their twelfth album, &quot;Oh No&quot;, was released on March 26, 2021. Its lead single, &quot;A Bottle of Rum&quot; featuring Liz Harris, was released along with the album&#x27;s announcement on January 27, 2021. Its second single, &quot;Rumpus Room&quot; featuring Liars, was released on March 4, 2021. &quot;Maybae Baeby&quot;, the first single from their thirteenth studio album &quot;Ignore Grief&quot;, was released on January 12, 2023. The album features new member David Kendrick, formerly of Sparks and Devo.

Their fourteenth album, &quot;13&quot; Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto with Bison Horn Grips&quot; was announced on June 25th, 2024 and released on September 27th.

===Timeline===
== Musical style and influences ==
The band&#x27;s name comes from the film &quot;Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl&quot;. The band found its first tracks to match the &quot;rotten realness&quot; spirit of the film, &quot;that sometimes life turns out with a worst possible case scenario&quot;. Stewart said Tracy Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Fast Car&quot;, which Xiu Xiu covered on &quot;A Promise&quot;, had a similar theme.

&quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot;‚Ä≥s David Espinoza likened Stewart to an explorer charting new territories of sound in 2001 as he started Xiu Xiu. He compared Stewart&#x27;s voice to a combination of Robert Smith&#x27;s fragility and &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;-era Trent Reznor&#x27;s anger, and noted Stewart&#x27;s deliberate and considered choices towards developing the band&#x27;s tone in light of the disparate wackiness of the individual instruments.

Brandon Stosuy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted a &quot;continual poetic and romantic beauty&quot; behind &quot;the violence&quot; in Stewart&#x27;s lyrics. He wrote that the band inspired fandom of the kind where teenage girls ask for Stewart&#x27;s autograph.

Stewart has added that the band was a product of San Jose pirate radio stations that played house, hi-NRG, freestyle, and techno, which Stewart considered unpretentious, plain, heartbroken, clear, and based around dancing away sadness. They said they wrote their first Xiu Xiu song after leaving a San Jose dance club alone on a Christmas night: &quot;Xiu Xiu came from feeling stupid and lonely and then wanting to dance it away, but having the club and its music only magnify that stupid and lonely feeling.&quot; At the time of &quot;A Promise&quot;, Stewart said that they were influenced by gamelan and Japanese and Korean folk music, and had been listening to contemporary classical and &quot;gay dance music&quot;.

=== Live performances ===
In 2003, Stewart told Pitchfork that the band&#x27;s live shows were starkly different from the recorded material. They said this was largely due to the technical limitations of being able to reproduce the way it was recorded. In their live shows, the band increased the intensity of their loud rock parts, though Stewart reported their set to be half &quot;louder, more dance-y stuff&quot; and half &quot;really quiet stuff&quot;. They said the latter was sometimes at odds with the type of venues they played.

<doc id="612085" wikidata="Q1651604" url="?curid=612085" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 446">
<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 446, adopted on 22 March 1979, concerned the issue of Israeli settlements in the &quot;Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem&quot;. This refers to the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip as well as the Syrian Golan Heights.

In the resolution, the Security Council determined: &quot;that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East&quot;.

The resolution was adopted by 12 votes to none, with 3 abstentions from Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

==Text of resolution==
The Security Council,

&quot;Having heard&quot; the statement of the Permanent Representative of Jordan and other statements made before the Council,

&quot;Stressing&quot; the urgent need to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East,

&quot;Affirming once more&quot; that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem,

1. &quot;Determines&quot; that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East;

2. &quot;Strongly deplores&quot; the failure of Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 237 (1967) of 14 June 1967, 252 (1968) of 21 May 1968 and 298 (1971) of 25 September 1971 and the consensus statement by the President of the Security Council on 11 November 1976 and General Assembly resolutions 2253 (ES-V) and 2254 (ES-V) of 4 and 14 July 1967, 32/5 of 28 October 1977 and 33/113 of 18 December 1978;

3. &quot;Calls once more upon&quot; Israel, as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, to rescind its previous measures and to desist from taking any action which would result in changing the legal status and geographical nature and materially affecting the demographic composition of the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and, in particular, not to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the occupied Arab territories;

4. &quot;Establishes&quot; a Commission consisting of three members of the Security Council, to be appointed by the President of the Council after consultations with the members of the Council, to examine the situation relating to settlements in the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem;

5. &quot;Requests&quot; the Commission to submit its report to the Security Council by 1 July 1979;

6. &quot;Requests&quot; the Secretary-General to provide the Commission with the necessary facilities to enable it to carry out its mission.

7. &quot;Decides&quot; to keep the situation in the occupied territories under constant and close scrutiny and to reconvene in July 1979 to review the situation in the light of the findings of the Commission.

==UNSC Resolution 446 and the Fourth Geneva Convention==
Resolution 446 affirms &quot;once more that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem&quot;. Tomis Kapitan reports that:

:&quot;In the eyes of the world community, its [Israel&#x27;s] presence there [in the Occupied Territories] is subject to international law dealing with belligerent occupancy, specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949... Allowing for measures of military necessity, the Convention forbids alterations of the legal system, forcible transfer or deportation of the resident population, and resettlement by the occupying power of its own civilian population within the occupied territory. Israel has violated these provisions, but contested their application on the grounds that the West Bank (in particular) is &quot;disputed&quot; or &quot;unallocated&quot; rather than the occupied territory of a nation that is party to the Geneva Convention.&quot;

Israel&#x27;s argument against the applicability of the convention was formulated by Meir Shamgar and is based on an interpretation of Article 2, which reads:

:&quot;In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace-time, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.

:The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.&quot;

The government&#x27;s argument (first made by Moshe Dayan in a speech to the UN in 1977) is that neither the West Bank nor Gaza were the territory of a &quot;High Contracting Power&quot; at the time they were occupied by Israel and that therefore the Convention does not apply.

In 1993 the UN Security Council &quot;acting under Chapter VII of the Charter on the United Nations&quot; approved a report by the Secretary General which concluded beyond doubt that the law applicable in armed conflict as embodied in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Hague Convention (IV) of 18 October 1907 had become part of international customary law. Breaches of the principles contained in the conventions were subsequently placed within the competence of international criminal tribunals, including International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and International Criminal Court.

Gershom Gorenberg has written that the Israeli government knew at the outset that it was violating the Geneva Convention by creating civilian settlements in the territories under IDF administration. He explained that as the legal counsel of the Foreign Ministry, Theodor Meron was the Israeli government&#x27;s expert on international law. On 16 September 1967 Meron wrote a top secret memo to Mr. Adi Yafeh, Political Secretary of the Prime Minister regarding &quot;Settlement in the Administered Territories&quot; which said &quot;My conclusion is that civilian settlement in the Administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.&quot; Moshe Dayan authored a secret memo in 1968 proposing massive settlement in the territories which said &quot;Settling Israelis in administered territory, as is known, contravenes international conventions, but there is nothing essentially new about that&quot;.

Israel&#x27;s positions have not been accepted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, nor has it been endorsed by the other High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 1 of the Convention states that &quot;The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention &quot;in all circumstances&quot;&quot; (emphasis added).

On 15 July 1999 a conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention met at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. It ruled that the Convention did apply in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem. In 2001, at a one-day conference of High Contracting Parties, 114 countries adopted a three-page declaration re-affirming that the terms of the Convention applied to the Palestinian territories.

In August 2004 an Israeli justice ministry team set up by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz to study the ramifications of a ruling by the World Court recommended that the Israeli government should consider applying the Fourth Geneva Convention to the West Bank and Gaza.

Israel argues that it is not in violation of it. Firstly, Israel argues that the article was created in the context of World War II only.

Secondly, it is only intended to cover &quot;forcible&quot; transfers and to protect the local population from displacement. Article 49(1)of the Convention specifically covers &quot;[i]ndividual or mass &quot;forcible&quot; transfers&quot; whereas the Israelis who live in the settlements have moved there voluntarily, and argue that settlements are not intended to, nor have ever resulted in, the displacement of Palestinians from the area. However, Article 49(6) also prohibits Israel to &#x27;transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies&#x27;, which would cover the Israeli settlements.

Thirdly, Israel claims that some of the settlers have returned to areas where Jewish settlements existed before 1948 (such as Gush Etzion) and therefore it is an entirely different issue.

Fourthly, Israel claims that the Geneva Convention only applies in the absence of an operative peace agreement and between two powers accepting the convention. Since the Oslo Accords leave the issue of settlements to be negotiated later, proponents of this view argue that the Palestinians accepted the temporary presence of Israeli settlements pending further negotiation, and that there is no basis for declaring them illegal.

==Unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip==
Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip in September 2005, removing all its settlements and military forces, but remaining in control of Gaza&#x27;s airspace and territorial waters. It relinquished control of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, until it took back control in May 2024, during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war.

<text>The Battle of Island Number Ten was an engagement at the New Madrid or Kentucky Bend on the Mississippi Riverforming the border between Missouri and Tennesseeduring the American Civil War, lasting from February 28 to April 8, 1862. Island Number Ten, a small island at the (Tennessee) base of a tight double turn in the river, was held by the Confederates from the early days of the war. It was an excellent site to impede Union efforts to invade the South by the river, as ships had to approach the island bows on and then slow to make the turns. For the defenders, however, it had an innate weakness in that it depended on a single road for supplies and reinforcements. If an enemy force managed to cut that road, the garrison would be isolated and eventually be forced to surrender.

Union forces began the siege in March 1862, shortly after the Confederate Army abandoned their position at Columbus, Kentucky. The Union Army of the Mississippi under Brigadier General John Pope made the first probes, coming overland through Missouri and occupying the town of Point Pleasant, Missouri, almost directly west of the island and south of New Madrid. Pope&#x27;s army then moved north and soon brought siege guns to bear on New Madrid. The Confederate commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, decided to evacuate the town after only one day of heavy bombardment, moving most of his troops to Island No. 10, abandoning his heavy artillery and most of his supplies.

Two days after the fall of New Madrid, Union gunboats and mortar rafts sailed downstream to attack Island No. 10. Over the next three weeks, the island&#x27;s defenders and forces in the nearby supporting batteries were subjected to a steady bombardment by the flotilla, mostly carried out by the mortars. At the same time, the Union forces at New Madrid were digging a canal across the neck of land east of the town to bypass Island No. 10. Several transports were sent to the Army of the Mississippi when the canal was finished, which provided the army with a way to cross the river and attack the Confederate troops on the Tennessee side.

Pope persuaded Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote to send a gunboat past the batteries, to assist him in crossing the river by keeping off any Southern gunboats and suppressing Confederate artillery fire at the point of attack. The , under Commander Henry Walke, slipped past the island on the night of April 4, 1862. This was followed by the , under Lieutenant Egbert Thompson two nights later. With the support of these two gunboats, Pope was able to move his army across the river and trap the Confederates opposite the island, who by now were trying to retreat. Outnumbered at least three to one, the Confederates realized their situation was hopeless and decided to surrender. At about the same time, the garrison on the island surrendered to Flag Officer Foote and the Union flotilla.

The Union victory marked the first time the Confederate Army lost a position on the Mississippi River in battle. The river was now open to the Union Navy as far as Fort Pillow, a short distance above Memphis. Only three weeks later, New Orleans fell to a Union fleet led by David G. Farragut, and the Confederacy was in danger of being cut in two along the line of the river.

Island No. 10 owed its name to the fact that it was at one time the tenth island in the Mississippi River south of its junction with the Ohio. An evanescent product of the river, it was an enlarged sandbar, roughly long and wide at its maximum width, and standing about above low water.

More important than the island itself was the course of the river in its neighborhood. Island No. 10 was at the southern extremity of a clockwise turn of the river through 180¬∞, which was followed immediately by a counterclockwise turn that left the river moving almost parallel to its original course, but displaced to the west by about . The turns are quite tight: the distance from the southern limit of the first turn to the northern limit of the second is only by air, or measured along the river channel. The double bend, which still exists in almost the same location, is known as the New Madrid Bend. However, the area across the Mississippi River from New Madrid, Missouri on the Kentucky and Tennessee shore was known during the Civil War simply as Madrid Bend. The town of New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid), which gives the bend its name, is at the northern apex of the second turn. 
The mainland behind the island on the south side was connected to the town of Tiptonville, Tennessee, by a good road on the natural levee of the river. This was the only approach to the island on dry land through Tennessee, as the region is otherwise a mixture of lakes, sloughs, and swamps, with the nearest high ground nearly to the east. Reelfoot Lake, the largest of these, was long and in places wide. In low water, the northern end of Reelfoot Lake was near Tiptonville, but in high water such as was present in the spring of 1862, it extended north to beyond the bend. The water was nowhere very deep, so individual soldiers could cross it by wading or using makeshift rafts, but an army trying to do so would not be able to move its heavy equipment, and also would lose cohesion. For these reasons, Island No. 10 was considered to be invulnerable to land attack from the Tennessee side. It also meant, however, that the only route for either reinforcement or escape was the Tiptonville road.

The land on the Missouri side was higher, although not high enough to give guns mounted there the advantage of plunging fire. The river banks, about above low water, were only about one-third as high as the bluffs that had aided the Confederate defense against gunboats at the Battle of Fort Donelson. At high water, although shore-based guns would not be drowned as they had been at the Battle of Fort Henry, they would nevertheless be no higher than the guns of vessels on the river.
===Confederate command===
During the first year of the war, the Confederate forces in the West went through a series of command changes that are often confusing, and left responsibility for particular actions hard to pin down. Although New Madrid was in Missouri, it was in a pro-Southern part of the state, and therefore fell within the purview of Confederate Department No. 2. In command of the department was Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk. The region of the bend was brought to official notice by one of Polk&#x27;s subordinates, Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow. Neither Pillow nor Polk was actively involved in developing the defenses at the bend; the latter assigned an army engineer, Captain Asa B. Gray, to the task, but he was not given adequate resources. On September 15, General Albert Sidney Johnston superseded Polk in command of Department No. 2, with Polk remaining in a subordinate position. Like his predecessor, Johnston took no active interest in Island No. 10. In early February, just in time for the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson, General P. G. T. Beauregard was sent to the West to command the Army of the Mississippi, and became in effect Johnston&#x27;s second in command. He recognized the importance of Island No. 10, and issued the orders to abandon Columbus and move its garrison there. His health failed him at this time, so he could not take personal charge. When he recovered, he and General Johnston were preoccupied with preparations for the forthcoming Battle of Shiloh. Transferred from Columbus to Island No. 10 was Major General John P. McCown, who thereby became local commander. He remained in charge until after New Madrid was taken by the Union Army of the Mississippi; on March 31, 1862, he was replaced by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall.

Through all of these command changes, the vessels of the Confederate States Navy along the entire length of the Mississippi were led by Flag Officer George N. Hollins. Because the river lay in two military departments, Hollins had to work with both the man in charge at the New Madrid Bend and the man in charge of the defenses of New Orleans.

===Union command===
At this time, command of the Union forces was also in flux, but it had little bearing on the issue. From the time the campaign against New Madrid began, in late February 1862, the Army of the Mississippi was led by Maj. Gen. John Pope. The army was a part of, first, the Department of the Missouri, and after March 11, the Department of the Mississippi, both under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck. The name change represented organizational changes in the army that did not affect the campaign.

The warships employed in the campaign were part of the Western Gunboat Flotilla, led by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. Foote was a captain in the US Navy, but the flotilla was organized as part of the U.S. Army, so he reported to, and was subordinate to, Halleck.

===Early defense preparations===
The widespread publicity given to Union General in Chief Winfield Scott&#x27;s Anaconda Plan made the Confederate government aware of the threat that would be posed to the Mississippi Valley by a water-borne invasion along the course of the river. In response, they set up a series of defensive positions along the river. Among them were Fort Pillow, north of Memphis, and extensive works at Columbus, Kentucky, both of which positions were important in relation to Island No. 10.

Construction of the batteries on and near the island began in mid-August 1861, directed by Captain Asa B. Gray. He began by laying out a battery on the Tennessee shore about above the island. This battery, known as Battery No. 1 or the Redan Battery, commanded the approach to the bend. Vessels coming down the river would have to move directly toward its guns for more than a mile. It was not very effective, as it was sited on low ground subject to flooding. Almost as soon as work was started, however, the attention of Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk was diverted to the capture and fortification of Columbus. Work continued at Island No. 10, but it was not regarded as urgent and so was denied both equipment and workers.

The importance of the New Madrid Bend rose dramatically when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned as quietly as possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the position from Battery No. 1 to Point Pleasant.

McCown, with adequate resources, was able to transform the island and nearby mainland into a formidable obstacle for any fleet attempting to pass. By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery &quot;New Orleans,&quot; with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island. In addition, two forts had been set up at New Madrid: Fort Thompson to the west, with 14 guns, and Fort Bankhead with 7 guns to the east, where St. John&#x27;s Bayou met the Mississippi.

The Confederate Navy also supported the position. Flag Officer George N. Hollins commanded six gunboats in the river between Fort Pillow and Island No. 10. All of these were unarmored; the armored ram CSS &quot;Manassas&quot; would have been there also, but she was found to be unable to operate in the relatively shallow water. She was damaged by running aground on the way north, so she was sent back to New Orleans.

===Union preliminaries===
Preparations by the Union for the attack on New Madrid and vicinity began before the evacuation of Columbus. On February 23, 1862, Maj. Gen. Pope was placed in command of the (Union) Army of the Mississippi, assembling at Commerce, Missouri. It was common practice at that time to go into winter quarters and await the arrival of good weather in the spring, but Pope soon had his army, which at this early stage of the campaign numbered 10,000 men, on the march, corduroying roads when necessary. The army arrived at New Madrid on March 3, but were not yet prepared to attack the Confederate positions. Preparing for a siege, Pope requested that his army be supplied with some heavy artillery, which arrived on March 12.

The gunboats under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote were not ready to cooperate with the Army of the Mississippi at this early date, as the damages they had received at Fort Donelson were still being repaired. They were finally sent down from Cairo on March 14, with Foote yet believing that they were not ready for combat. The Union fleet was augmented by the addition of 14 mortar rafts, vessels that each mounted a single mortar. The mortars were a semi-autonomous unit under the command of (Army) Captain Henry E. Maynadier.

==Opposing forces==

==Battle==

===First contact===
Unwilling to waste his troops in an assault on the forts at New Madrid, Pope sent a brigade under Colonel (later Brigadier General) Joseph B. Plummer to occupy the town of Point Pleasant, Missouri, on the right bank of the river almost directly opposite Island No. 10. The movement was contested by the Confederate gunboats, but Plummer&#x27;s troops soon learned that they had only to withdraw out of range when the gunboats appeared, and return as soon as they left. The brigade occupied Point Pleasant on March 6, and the boats shelled their positions for the next three days. In this period, the Confederate Army remained within their fortifications, offering no support to Flag Officer Hollins.

The siege guns arrived on March 12, surprising McCown and Hollins almost as much as the winter march of Pope&#x27;s army. They effectively closed the river to the unarmored gunboats, and prevented reinforcement of the artillery companies at New Madrid by shifting troops from Island No. 10.

The big guns opened fire on the New Madrid defensive positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be too exhausted to resist, so he decided not to wait for the inevitable. On the night of March 13‚Äì14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A heavy rainstorm hid the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope&#x27;s reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.

Following the loss of New Madrid, some of the units at the bend were withdrawn to Fort Pillow, not quite 70 air miles (113¬†km) to the south, but almost twice that by the river. McCown was replaced in command at the island by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall. Although this looks like a reprimand for his poor defense of New Madrid, McCown actually was promoted to major general.

===The siege===
The gunboats and mortars arrived on March 15, and the siege is dated from that time. Pope, in New Madrid, and Foote, upstream of the bend, were kept apart by Island No. 10. From the first, they did not agree how to go about conducting the operation. Pope wanted immediate action; Foote hoped to subdue the island by the slow process of bombardment. Foote was hampered by ambiguous or even contradictory orders from Halleck, who was distracted at the time by preparations for the advance along the Tennessee River that soon culminated in the Battle of Shiloh (or Pittsburg Landing). As early as March 17, Pope was asking that two or three gunboats run past the Confederate batteries, to enable him to cross the river and trap the entire garrison. Foote demurred, arguing that his boats were not invincible, that a chance disabling shot would deliver a boat into Confederate hands, and that gunboat could then threaten all the Northern cities along the Mississippi and its tributaries. Foote&#x27;s thinking may also have been affected by the wound he had received at Fort Donelson, which was not healing properly and kept him in pain and on crutches.
For the next two weeks, fighting consisted of bombardment of the island at rather long range, mostly conducted by the mortars, and occasionally replied to by the Confederate batteries. High expectations that had been held for the mortars were dashed; they did very little harm to the enemy position. The most significant damage incurred in this period was in fact self-inflicted: during a bombardment on March 17 in which the gunboats took part, a gun on exploded, killing three members of the crew and wounding a dozen others.

After Foote had flatly rejected Pope&#x27;s request that gunboats run past Island No. 10, someone on Pope&#x27;s staff suggested that perhaps a canal could be cut to enable Union vessels to bypass the batteries. The canal was completed in two weeks, but it was not deep enough to provide passage for the gunboats. It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and supply vessels could use it, so that Pope did not have to depend on land communications.

===Gunboats pass the batteries, complete the siege===

Pope still insisted that he needed a gunboat to cover his projected landing on the Tennessee side of the river. Foote called two councils of war among his captains; in the first, on March 20, his decision not to risk running past the batteries was confirmed. When Halleck wrote to Foote, saying, &quot;Give him (Pope) all the assistance in your power,&quot; Foote called a second council, on March 29. This time, Commander Henry Walke, captain of , thought that the risk was worth the candle, and volunteered to take his boat through. Foote gave the necessary orders, and &quot;Carondelet&quot; was prepared for the run. She was covered with rope, chain, and whatever loose material lay at hand. A coal barge filled with coal and hay was lashed to her side. Her steam exhaust was diverted from the smokestacks (called &quot;chimneys&quot; on river craft) to muffle the sound. She then had only to wait for a sufficiently dark night to make her run.

To reduce the danger as much as possible, a raid by sailors in the flotilla and soldiers from the 42nd Illinois Infantry, under Colonel George W. Roberts overran Battery No. 1 and spiked its guns on the night of April 1. On April 2, the flotilla, including both mortars and gunboats, concentrated its fire on the floating battery &quot;New Orleans.&quot; She was hit several times, and her mooring lines were parted. She drifted downstream, out of the war. On April 4, conditions for running past the remaining batteries were satisfactory. The night was moonless, and after dark a thunderstorm came up. &quot;Carondelet&quot; made her way downstream, and was not discovered until she was abreast of the Confederate Battery No. 2. She might have escaped detection completely had not her smokestacks blazed up; the buildup of soot, no longer dampened by escaping steam, caught fire and revealed her position. The batteries opened, but their fire was inaccurate, and &quot;Carondelet&quot; completed the run unscathed. Pope continued to press Foote for another gunboat, and two nights later made a similar run.

Pope now was able to cross the river with his army without prospect of interference from Confederate gunboats. He could also suppress enemy fire that may have opposed their landing. On April 7, he made his move, and sent the gunboats to destroy the batteries at Watson&#x27;s Landing, the place he had selected for the attack. When this was accomplished, the transports carried the troops across, and the landings proceeded without opposition.

A few hours elapsed until Mackall was able to decide what to do next. Realizing that his position was hopeless, he put the men on the mainland in motion in the direction of Tiptonville. The motion was detected by Pope&#x27;s spies, who gave the information to Pope. Pope then diverted his soldiers to Tiptonville, and the operation became a footrace rather than the expected battle. Mackall&#x27;s only hope was that the gunboats would not interfere, but they did, and the retreat of his army was delayed long enough for Pope&#x27;s men to get to Tiptonville first. The defenders were trapped, with no prospect of victory, so Mackall decided to surrender.

While this was taking place, the demoralized garrison of Island No. 10 surrendered separately to Flag Officer Foote and his gunboats. The river was then open as far as Fort Pillow.

==Conclusion==
The destruction of the Confederate garrison was complete. Only a few hundred individual soldiers managed to escape by wading or rafting across Reelfoot Lake and later rejoining the army. The number who were captured became a matter of controversy. Pope asserted, in his official reports, that he had taken 273 officers and 6,700 private soldiers captive. This is almost certainly a great exaggeration. Confederate records (admittedly incomplete) indicate that not more than 5,350 men were present. The number captured would then likely have been less than 4,500.

Aside from the prisoners taken, the number of casualties in the entire campaign was very low. From the fall of New Madrid to the surrender at Tiptonville, the Union army and navy had lost only 7 men killed from all causes, 4 missing, and 14 wounded. During the entire campaign, losses in the Army of the Mississippi were reported as 8 killed, 21 wounded, and 3 missing. Confederate losses in killed and wounded were not reported, but seem to have been similarly low. Although Beauregard sought early release for the men captured at Island No. 10, the offer was declined and several soldiers&#x27; wives who had been employed at the island choose to go north into captivity alongside their husbands. About 1,400 of the captured Confederate soldiers (many from the 1st Regiment Alabama Infantry) were transported by railroad to what was previously a Union Army training field in Madison, Wisconsin. This marked the beginning of Camp Randall&#x27;s use as a prisoner-of-war camp. From the end of April to the end of May, 140 of the prisoners died at Camp Randall, due to its unsanitary conditions, and are buried at Confederate Rest.
Because April 7 was the second day of the far bloodier Battle of Shiloh, the campaign for Island No. 10 soon fell from public notice. It has become memorable principally for the run of USS &quot;Carondelet&quot; past the batteries, whose passage marked the introduction of a new tactic in warfare. The use of steam for driving ships meant that they were no longer forced to neutralize fixed defenses or batteries. The tactic later became commonplace in the Civil War, being employed by Farragut at New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, and Mobile, and by David D. Porter at Vicksburg. Consequently, the value of fixed fortifications was much (but not completely) diminished. The restored nation had to consider this when designing its defense system after 1865. In addition, the impact of season and weather should also be recognized for aiding Union efforts; if the federals had arrived later in the summer after the spring freshet of high water, then their naval options would have been much more limited, no back channel could have been carved out, and Confederate chances for defense or withdrawal likely much improved.

<text>In botany, a bract is a modified or specialized leaf, especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a flower, inflorescence axis, or cone scale. 

Bracts are usually different from foliage leaves; they may be of a different size, color, shape, or texture. Typically, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals or sepals. 

A plant having bracts is referred to as bracteate or bracteolate, while one that lacks them is referred to as ebracteate or ebracteolate.

==Variants==

Some bracts are brightly coloured and serve the function of attracting pollinators, either together with the perianth or instead of it. Examples of this type of bract include those of &quot;Euphorbia pulcherrima&quot; (poinsettia) and &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;: both of these have large colourful bracts surrounding much smaller, less colourful flowers.

In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, called the lemma (lower bract) and palea (upper bract), while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called glumes. These bracts form the chaff removed from cereal grain during threshing and winnowing.

Bats may detect acoustic signals from dish-shaped bracts such as those of &quot;Marcgravia evenia&quot;.

A prophyll is a leaf-like structure, such as a bracteole, subtending (extending under) a single flower or pedicel. The term can also mean the lower bract on a peduncle.

The frequently showy pair of bracts of &quot;Euphorbia&quot; species in subgenus &quot;Lacanthis&quot; are the cyathophylls.

Bracts subtend the cone scales in the seed cones of many conifers, and in some cases, such as &quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;, they extend beyond the cone scales.

== Bracteole==
A small bract is called a bracteole or bractlet. Technically this is any bract that arises &quot;on&quot; a pedicel instead of subtending it.

== Involucral bracts ==
Bracts that appear in a whorl subtending an inflorescence are collectively called an involucre. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Dipsacaceae and Polygonaceae. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of bracts, in this case called an involucel. In this case they may be called &quot;chaff&quot;, &quot;paleas&quot;, or &quot;receptacular bracts&quot; and are usually minute scales or bristles. Many asteraceous plants have bracts at the base of each inflorescence.

The term involucre is also used for a highly conspicuous bract or bract pair at the base of an inflorescence. In the family Betulaceae, notably in the genera &quot;Carpinus&quot; and &quot;Corylus&quot;, the involucre is a leafy structure that protects the developing nuts. Beggar-tick (&quot;Bidens comosa&quot;) has narrow involucral bracts surrounding each inflorescence, each of which also has a single bract below it. There is then a pair of leafy bracts on the main stem and below those a pair of leaves.
==Epicalyx==
An epicalyx, which forms an additional whorl around the calyx of a single flower, is a modification of bracteoles In other words, the epicalyx is a &quot;group of bracts resembling a calyx&quot; or &quot;bracteoles forming a whorl outer to the calyx&quot;. It is a calyx-like extra whorl of floral appendages. Each individual segment of the epicalyx is called an episepal because they resemble the sepals in them. They are present in the hibiscus family, Malvaceae. &quot;Fragaria&quot; (strawberries) may or may not have an epicalyx.
==Spathe==
A &quot;spathe&quot; is a large bract or pair of bracts forming a sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as palms, arums, irises, crocuses, and dayflowers (&quot;Commelina&quot;). &quot;Zephyranthes tubispatha&quot; in the Amaryllidaceae derives its specific name from its tubular spathe. In many arums (family Araceae), the spathe is petal-like, attracting pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a spadix.

<text>The ideosphere‚Äîlike the noosphere (i.e., the realm of reason)‚Äîis the metaphysical &#x27;place&#x27; where thoughts, theories, ideas, and ideation are regarded to be created, evaluated, and evolved. 

Analogous to the biosphere (the realm of biological evolution), the ideosphere is the realm of memetic evolution, where &#x27;memes&#x27; take the role of biological genes. As such, the ideosphere is an entire memetic ecology: the collective intelligence of all humans wherein memes live, reproduce, compete, and mutate. 

The health of an ideosphere, in this sense, can be measured by its memetic diversity. Moreover, like the biosphere, it has ecological niches, which serve as environments for groups or audiences. For instance, some entities compete for ecological niches in the ideosphere, such as Buddha, Laozi, the &quot;kami&quot; of Shinto, Satan, Jesus Christ in Christianity and in other religions, etc. Another example, an ideosphere is formed around a linguistic system that involves a mixture of cynicism and sentimentality as well as the violent appropriation of the other&#x27;s word. 

Douglas Hofstadter and Aaron Lynch are considered to have independently co-invented the term &quot;ideosphere&quot; in the mid-1980s. 

The ideosphere is not considered to be a physical place by most people; instead, it is &quot;inside the minds&quot; of all the humans in the world. It is also sometimes believed that the Internet, books, and other media could be considered to be part of the ideosphere‚Äîhowever such media lack the ability to process the thoughts they contain. 

According to philosopher Yasuhiko Kimura, the ideosphere is &quot;concentric&quot; in form, as ideas are generated by a few people with others merely perceiving and accepting these ideas from these &quot;external authorities.&quot; He advocates an &quot;omnicentric&quot; configuration, wherein all individuals create new ideas and interact as self-authorities. There is the notion that most of humanity remains the consumer instead of producer of ideas. To address this, Kimura proposed the so-called ideospheric transformation, triggered by a synergetic phenomenon produced by the emergence of a sufficient number of authentic and independent thinkers.

<text>Wac≈Çaw Szybalski (: ; 9 September 1921 ‚Äì 16 December 2020) was a Polish-American medical researcher, geneticist and professor of oncology at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Medical School.

==Early life==
Wac≈Çaw Szybalski was born in September 1921 in Lw√≥w, Poland, into a Polish intelligentsia family. His father Stefan was an engineer, and his mother, Michalina &quot;n√©e&quot; Rakowska, was a Doctor of Chemistry. The Szybalski family maintained close friendships with numerous leading representatives of the Polish intelligentsia in Lw√≥w, including Professor Jan Czekanowski, the father of Polish anthropology, and the bacteriologist, Professor Rudolf Stefan Weigl.

In 1939 Szybalski graduated from the famous Gymnasium no. 8 in Lw√≥w. After World War II broke out, from 23 September 1939, Lw√≥w was occupied by the Soviet Union. Szybalski joined the Chemistry Department at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic, where he was captivated by the lectures of Professor Adolf Joszt, a leading expert on processes of fermentation. Joszt even then held a vision of developing science in the direction of genetic engineering and biotechnology, which had a direct influence on Szybalski&#x27;s future scientific development. After the German attack on the Soviet Union, in 1941 Lw√≥w was occupied by the Nazis. Szybalski survived the occupation by working as a feeder of lice in Rudolf Weigl&#x27;s institute for typhus research.

==Career in the United States==
Szybalski subsequently emigrated to the United States and became a professor of oncology at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Medical School.

The research he conducted in the United States began with genetic studies of drug resistance that led to the use of multi-drug therapy that is nowadays widely used to treat bacterial and viral infections and cancer. His studies of the antibiotic-producing soil microorganism, Streptomyces, yielded information that was useful in the commercial production of streptomycin, an effective therapeutic for treating tuberculosis.

He served as the first Editor-in-Chief of the journal &quot;Gene&quot; from 1976 to 1996. He published 145 academic papers, 82 of which were published in &quot;Gene&quot; reflecting the major impact that he had on the field of molecular genetics. His best cited paper was a highly influential study that was published in 1979 in which he published a comprehensive molecular map of bacteriophage-lambda. This study was cited nearly 300 times and is particularly important, because bacteriophage-lambda was used for the early cloning of recombinant DNA. The use of recombination vectors like lambda permitted cloning of large human genomic DNAs that did not fit into small plasmid vectors and the use of lambda provided the basis for the modern era of human genetics.

He died in December 2020 in Madison, Wisconsin at the age of 99.

<text>The great stone-curlew or great thick-knee (Esacus recurvirostris) is a large wader which is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh into South-east Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The great stone-curlew was formally described in 1829 by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier and given the binomial name &quot;Oedicnemus recurvirostris&quot;. The type locality is Nepal. The specific epithet &quot;recurvirostris&quot; combines Latin &quot;recurvis&quot; meaning &quot;bent backwards&quot; with &quot;-rostris&quot; meaning &quot;-billed&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Esacus&quot; that was introduced in 1831 to accommodate the great stone-curlew by the French naturalist Ren√© Lesson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The great thick-knee is a large wader at 49‚Äì55¬†cm, and has a massive 7¬†cm bill with the lower mandible with a sharp angle giving it an upturned appearance. It has unstreaked grey-brown upperparts and breast, with rest of the underparts whitish. The face has a striking black and white pattern, and the bill is black with a yellow base. The eyes are bright yellow and the legs a duller greenish-yellow. In flight, the great thick-knee shows black and white flight feathers on the upperwing, and a mainly white underwing. Sexes are similar, but young birds are slightly paler than adults.

==Behaviour==
This species prefers gravel banks along rivers or large lakes, and also beaches. It is mainly nocturnal or crepuscular like other stone-curlews, but can frequently be seen foraging during the day, moving slowly and deliberately, with occasional short runs. It tends to be wary and flies off into the distance ahead of the observer, employing powerful, rather stiff wingbeats. The call is a wailing whistle, given mainly at night, as with other birds in this family. The great thick-knee eats crabs, large insects, and other animal prey. A single egg is laid in a bare scrape on the open shingle.

Fourteen &quot;Baltimore&quot;s were completed, more than any other class of heavy cruiser (the British had 15 vessels planned, but only 13 completed), along with another three ships of the sub-class. The &quot;Baltimore&quot;s also were the first cruisers in the US Navy to be designed without the limitations of the London Naval Treaty.

Fast and heavily armed, the &quot;Baltimore&quot; cruisers were mainly used in World War II as anti-aircraft cruisers to protect the fast aircraft carriers in battle groups from air attack. Additionally, their main guns and secondary guns were regularly used to bombard land targets in support of amphibious landings. After the war, only six &quot;Baltimore&quot;s (&quot;St. Paul&quot;, &quot;Macon&quot;, &quot;Toledo&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot;, &quot;Bremerton&quot;, and &quot;Helena&quot;) and two &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class ships (&quot;Albany&quot; and &quot;Rochester&quot;) remained in service, while the rest were moved to the reserve fleet. However, all ships except &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Fall River&quot; were reactivated for the Korean War.

Except for &quot;St. Paul&quot;, all the ships retaining all-gun configurations had very short (18 years or less) service lives, and by 1971 were decommissioned, and started being sold for scrap. However, four &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers were refitted and converted into some of the first guided missile cruisers in the world, becoming two of the three and two cruisers. The last of these was decommissioned in 1980, with the &quot;Chicago&quot; lasting until 1991 in reserve. No example of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class still exists.

==History==

===Planning and construction===

Immediately after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the US Navy initiated studies regarding a new class of heavy cruiser that led to construction of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class. With the start of the war, the limitations instituted by the Second London Naval Treaty, which had completely banned the construction of heavy cruisers, became obsolete. The &quot;Baltimore&quot; class was based partly on , a heavy cruiser from 1937, which represented the transition from inter-war to World War II designs. It was also based partly on the , a light cruiser that was then being built. In profile, the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s looked very much like the &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers, the obvious difference being that the larger &quot;Baltimore&quot;s carried nine guns in three triple turrets, compared to the twelve guns in four triple turrets of the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s.

The construction of the first four ships of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class began on 1 July 1940, and four more were ordered before the year was out. A second order, which consisted of 16 more ships, was approved on 7 August 1942. Despite the heavy losses in cruisers during the first 14 months of the Pacific War, the completion of the ships was delayed because the Navy gave priority to the construction of the lighter &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class ships, as more of the lighter ships could be completed more quickly for deployment in carrier groups. With the construction of the first eight &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class ships moving slowly, the US Navy used the time to review the initial plans and improve them. The new, modified design was itself delayed, so that construction had begun on a further six ships‚Äîfor a total of 14‚Äîusing the original design before the revisions were completed. The final three ships ordered were converted to the second design, known as the &quot;Oregon City&quot; class. Between 1943 and 1947, 17 ships of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; and &quot;Oregon City&quot; classes entered service. Construction of the eighteenth ship () was suspended, to eventually be completed as a flagship/command ship in 1950. Five more were laid down but cancelled and scrapped before launch, and one was never started before being cancelled.

The largest contractor for the construction of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class ships was Bethlehem Steel, which produced eight ships at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey, built four and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia completed two. The ships were named after cities in the United States, the only exception being , which was named in honor of (sunk at the battle of Savo Island), which had been named after Canberra, the Australian capital. The classification &quot;CA&quot; originally stood for &quot;armored cruiser&quot; but was later used for heavy cruisers.

===Service===

Of the seventeen (including the three &quot;Oregon City&quot;s) completed ships, twelve were commissioned before the Japanese capitulation on 2 September 1945, though only seven took part in the battles of the Pacific Theater and one in the European Theater. By 1947, nine of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s had been decommissioned and placed in the reserve fleet, while seven (&quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Toledo&quot;, &quot;Macon&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot;, &quot;Saint Paul&quot;, &quot;Rochester&quot;, and &quot;Albany&quot;) remained in service. However, at the start of the 1950s, six were reactivated (&quot;Macon&quot; had been decommissioned for four short months: June‚ÄìOctober 1950), making thirteen available for deployment in the Korean War. Six of these were used for escort missions and coastal bombardment in Korea, while the other seven reinforced fleets in other areas of the globe. Four ships remained out of service: the &quot;Fall River&quot; was never reactivated, the &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; were refitted as &quot;Boston&quot;-class guided missile cruisers (CGs), and the &quot;Chicago&quot; was reactivated after being converted to an &quot;Albany&quot;-class CG.

After the Korean War ended and due to the high cost of keeping them in service; starting in 1954 with &quot;Quincy&quot;, some of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s were decommissioned for good. By 1969, only six ships were still in commission; five (&quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Columbus&quot;, &quot;Albany&quot;) as CGs (guided missile cruisers), and only one unmodified ship, the &quot;Saint Paul&quot;, which remained active to serve in the Vietnam War, providing gunfire support. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was the only member of the class to serve continuously from commissioning (serving 26 years) and was finally decommissioned in 1971. &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; retired in 1970, &quot;Columbus&quot; (serving 29.5 years) in 1975, and finally &quot;Chicago&quot; in 1980. Starting in 1972 all fourteen of the original &quot;Baltimore&quot;s were sold for scrap after being decommissioned, with &quot;Chicago&quot; being the final one broken up in 1991.

====Damage====

In World War II, only the was damaged through enemy fire, when she was struck with an air-dropped torpedo on 13 October 1944, which killed 23 men in the engine room and left the ship immobilized. The ship was hit amidships and both boiler rooms were flooded with 3,000 tons of seawater. She was towed away by sister ship , and as a result, both ships missed the crucial Battle of Leyte Gulf. A year later, repairs were completed at the Boston Naval Shipyard, and &quot;Canberra&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. In June 1945, had her entire bow ripped off in a typhoon, but there were no casualties. The ship struggled through winds to Guam, where provisional repairs were made before sailing to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a full reconstruction. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;‚Ä≥s detached bow stayed afloat, and it was later towed into Guam and scrapped.

During the Korean War, a fire in a forward gun turret on 12 April 1952, killed 30 men on &quot;St. Paul&quot;. Then, in 1953, the same ship was hit by a coastal battery, though without injury to the crew. &quot;Helena&quot; in 1951 and &quot;Los Angeles&quot; in 1953 were also struck by coastal batteries without injuries during the war.

In June 1968, &quot;Boston&quot;, along with its escort, the Australian destroyer , were victims of friendly fire when planes of the US Air Force mistook them for enemy targets and fired on them with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. Only &quot;Hobart&quot; was seriously damaged; although &quot;Boston&quot; was hit, the warhead of the missile failed to detonate.

===Missile conversions===
By the latter half of the 1940s, the US Navy was planning and experimenting with warships equipped with guided missiles. In 1946 the battleship and in 1948 the seaplane tender were converted to test this idea. Both were equipped with, among other weapons, RIM-2 Terrier missiles, which were also used after 1952 on the first series of operational missile cruisers. Two &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers were refitted in this first series, and . These were the first operational guided missile cruisers in the world. They were designated the &quot;Boston&quot; class and returned to service in 1955 and 1956 respectively, reclassified as CAG-1 and CAG-2‚Äî&quot;G&quot; for &quot;guided missile&quot; and maintaining the &quot;A&quot; because they retained their heavy guns.

In the following years, six light cruisers of the &quot;Cleveland&quot; class were retrofitted to be equipped with guided missiles, and in 1957, the first warship designed from the start to be a missile cruiser was completed (). Other ships also continued to be converted, so starting in 1958, two &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers, and , along with an , (considered a sub-class of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class) , were converted to the new &quot;Albany&quot; class. These were recommissioned in 1962 and 1964, respectively. Two more ships were planned to be refitted as &quot;Albany&quot;s, the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class and the &quot;Oregon City&quot; class , but these conversions were cancelled because of cost. As opposed to the &quot;Boston&quot;-class refit, the &quot;Albany&quot;-class refit required a total reconstruction. Both entire weapons systems and the superstructure were removed and replaced with new ones; the cost of one refit was $175¬†million. Because no high-caliber guns were retained, the &quot;Albany&quot; class ships received the designation &quot;CG&quot; rather than &quot;CAG&quot;.

In addition to the operational conversions, four &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class ships, , , , and , received modifications to operate the SSM-N-8 Regulus cruise missile between 1956 and 1958 on an experimental basis. Regulus was a nuclear-armed weapon that was primarily used by the US Navy in the nuclear deterrent role. Although associated primarily with submarines, the four &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers fitted to operate the missile undertook operational taskings with it to the Western Pacific during the experimental period.

==Engineering and equipment==

===Hull===
&quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers were long and wide. Since the hull was not altered in either the &quot;Albany&quot; or the &quot;Boston&quot; class, these numbers were the same for those ships as well, but the alterations differentiated them in all other categories.

Fully loaded, original &quot;Baltimore&quot;s displaced of water. Their draft was . At the bow, the top level of the hull lay above the water; at the stern, . The funnels were high, and the highest point on the masts was at . The superstructure occupied about a third of the ship&#x27;s length and was divided into two deckhouses. The gap between these housed the two thin funnels. Two masts, one a bit forward and the other a bit aft of the funnels, accommodated the positioning electronics.

The vertical belt armor was thick and the horizontal deck armor was up to thick. The turrets were also heavily armored, between thick, while the conning tower had up to .

The &quot;Boston&quot; class had a draft about deeper in the water and displaced about more water than their former sister ships. Because the &quot;Boston&quot;s were only partially refitted, the forward third of the ship remained virtually untouched. The first serious change was the combination of what were two funnels on the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s to just one, thicker funnel, which still stood in the gap between the two deckhouses. Because the missiles required more guiding electronic systems, the forward mast was replaced with a four-legged lattice mast with an enlarged platform. The most conspicuous change was of course the addition of the missile-launching apparatus and its magazine of missiles, which took up the entire back half of the ship and replaced the guns which had been there.

The three &quot;Albany&quot;s were completely rebuilt from the deck level up; except for the hull, they bore very little resemblance to their former sister ships. The deckhouse now took up nearly two-thirds of the ship&#x27;s length and was two decks high for almost the entire length. Above that lay the box-shaped bridge which was one of the most recognizable markers of the class. The two masts and funnels were combined into the so-called &quot;macks&quot;, combining &quot;mast&quot; and &quot;stack&quot; (smokestack), where the electronics platforms were attached to the tops of the funnels rather than attached to masts rising all the way from the deck. The highest points on the forward mack were more than above the water line. Such heights could only be achieved with the use of aluminum alloys, which were used to a great extent in the construction of the superstructures. Despite this, the fully loaded displacement of the &quot;Albany&quot;s grew to more than .

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Baltimore&quot; cruisers were propelled with steam power. Each ship had four shafts, each with a propeller. The shafts were turned by four steam turbines, the steam produced by four boilers, which at full speed reached pressures of up to . The &quot;Baltimore&quot;s each had two engine rooms and two funnels, although this was changed in the &quot;Boston&quot;s, which had only one funnel for all four boilers, as noted above. The high speed was around and the performance of the engine was around .

The original &quot;Baltimore&quot;s could carry up to of fuel, putting the maximum range at a cruising speed of at about . The increased displacement of the modified &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Albany&quot; classes meant their range was reduced to about 9000 and respectively, despite increases in fuel capacity to 2600 and 2500 tons.

===Armament===
The main armament of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class consisted of three turrets, each with three Mark 15 8&quot;/55 caliber guns (Mark 12 in &quot;Baltimore&quot;). Two of these were located forward and one aft. They fired a 335-pound (152¬†kg) shell out to a maximum range of 30,050 yards (27,480 m). The armor-piercing shell could penetrate six inches of armor plating at . The secondary armament consisted of twelve 5&quot;/38 caliber guns in six twin mounts. Two mounts were located on each side of the superstructure and two were behind the main batteries fore and aft. These guns could be used against aircraft and surface targets. Their maximum range for surface targets was and they could reach aircraft at altitudes of up to . In addition, the ships had numerous light anti-aircraft weapons: 12 quadruple mounts of Bofors 40 mm guns (or 11 quadruple mounts and 2 twin mounts on ships with only one rear aircraft crane) as well as 20‚Äì28 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, depending on when a given ship was commissioned. After World War II the 20 mm anti-aircraft guns were removed without replacement, due to limited effectiveness against kamikaze attacks, and because it was expected they would be completely ineffective against postwar jet aircraft. The 40 mm Bofors were replaced with 3&quot;/50 caliber guns in the 1950s.

Four ships, , , , and , were also each equipped with three nuclear cruise missiles of the SSM-N-8 Regulus type between 1956 and 1958. Ultimately, though, the deployment of such missiles on surface ships remained an experiment, which was only undertaken until the 1960s. The successor UGM-27 Polaris was carried only by nuclear submarines. In the late 1950s, plans were made to fit Polaris to missile conversions of these cruisers, but the only missile cruiser conversion ever so equipped was the , (four tubes), and the missiles were never actually shipped.

===Electronics===

Initially, the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s were equipped with SG radar systems for surface targets and SK systems for airborne targets. The range of these systems for surface targets, depending on the size of the target was between . The SK could detect bombers at medium altitudes from . The radar systems were replaced in the Korean War with the more effective SPS-6 (built by Westinghouse Electric or later with the SPS-12 (from the Radio Corporation of America combined with an SPS-8 as a height-finder. With these systems, the detection range for bombers was increased to . The ships in active service longer received further upgrades in their final years: the SPS-6 was replaced with the SPS-37 (also from Westinghouse) and the SPS-12 was replaced with the SPS-10 from Raytheon. With this equipment, planes could be detected at over away.

The &quot;Baltimore&quot; class was equipped from the start with electronic and electromechanical fire control systems to determine the fire parameters by which targets over the horizon could be hit. The main guns were controlled by a Mark 34 fire control system connected to an Mk 8 radar. The 5-inch/38 dual-purpose guns were guided by two Mk 37 systems with Mk 4 radar. Later, the fire control radars were replaced along with the main radar systems. The fire control systems remained the same except that the new 3-inch guns were upgraded to Mk 56 with Mk 35 radars.

===Aircraft===

The onboard flight systems of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers during World War II consisted of two aircraft catapults on the side edges of the aft deck. Between the catapults was a sliding hatchway which was the roof of an onboard hangar. Directly under the hatch was an aircraft elevator. The hangar had room to accommodate up to four aircraft at one time, one to port forward of the elevator, one to port abeam the elevator, one starboard abeam, and one on the elevator itself. The first four ships of the class had two cranes each, while the later models had only one.

At full speed, the Vought OS2U Kingfisher could be launched from these catapults and later the Curtiss SC-1 Seahawk. These planes were used for reconnaissance, anti-submarine, and rescue missions. The planes were seaplanes, and after their missions would land in the water near the cruiser and be lifted back up into the ship by the crane or cranes in the rear and reset upon their catapults. In the 1950s, the catapults and the accompanying capacity to launch airplanes were removed, though the cranes were left and the hangars used to house helicopters, ship&#x27;s boats or the workings of the Regulus missile system.

&quot;Macon&quot; in 1948 had a slightly elevated helipad installed instead of the catapults. Because of the helipad, the available firing angles for the main guns were sharply narrowed and the experiment was therefore quickly abandoned and not attempted on any other ships of the class. The ships of the &quot;Albany&quot; class did have an area on the deck for helicopters to land, but no platform.

===Later designs===
The hull of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class was used for the development of several other classes. The &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class cruisers differed only slightly from &quot;Baltimore&quot;s, because they were originally planned as &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers but were constructed based on modified plans. Though nine ships were planned, only three were completed. The main differences between the two classes are the reduction to a single-trunked funnel; a redesigned forward superstructure that was placed further aft, primarily to decrease top-heaviness; and an increase in the arcs of fire for the guns. 

A fourth &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class cruiser, the , was ultimately completed as a light command cruiser. Despite having a heavy cruiser hull, she was classed as a light cruiser because her main armament of four 5 inch guns was smaller than the 8 inch guns usually found on heavy cruisers.

The was an entirely new heavy cruiser design that attempted to improve upon the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class. While the basic deck and machinery layout was largely unchanged, this class carried the first fully automated high-caliber guns on a warship and had improved damage protection features, greatly improving both firepower and survivability. None was constructed in time to take part in World War II.

The plans for the light aircraft carrier were adapted from the drafts of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; hull design, including the layout of the engines. The hulls of these ships were, however, significantly widened. The &quot;Saipan&quot;-class ships were completed in 1947 and 1948, but by the mid-1950s, they proved too small for the planes of the jet age and were converted for use as communication and command ships.

==Crew==
The size of the crew of a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruiser varied by era and by tactical situation. Different sources also differ on the numbers. Naturally, the crew sizes were larger during wartime. Some cruisers‚Äîincluding all three of the modified &quot;Albany&quot; class‚Äîwere used as flagships and therefore housed an admiral and his staff.

At launch, during, and shortly after the war, the crews consisted of around 60 officers and about 1000 rank-and-file crewmen. When an admiral&#x27;s staff was aboard during wartime, this number could swell to 80 officers and 1500 crewmen. On the &quot;Boston&quot;s, the standard crew, even in peacetime and without an admiral&#x27;s staff, was 80 officers and around 1650 crewmen. Because the &quot;Albany&quot; class was equipped almost exclusively for guided missiles, it required fewer crew than the &quot;Boston&quot;s and was roughly comparable numerically to the basic &quot;Baltimore&quot;.

Compared to today&#x27;s crew sizes, these numbers seem high. The modern is manned by about 400. These differences are mostly due to the much less manpower-intensive nature of modern weapon systems.

<text>Eyes Adrift (known in Australia as Bud, Curt &amp; Krist) was a three-piece rock supergroup consisting of Krist Novoselic (bass guitar, formerly of Nirvana), Curt Kirkwood (guitar and lead vocals, of Meat Puppets), and Bud Gaugh (drums, formerly of Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars). They released a self-titled album in 2002, which was a mixture of punk, grunge, and country, taking all of their previous backgrounds and putting them together. They toured the United States in mid-2002. They later broke up in 2003, after their debut album flopped. Kirkwood and Gaugh went on to form the supergroup band known as Volcano. The album is currently out of print. Novoselic went on to become a political activist in Seattle, Washington, before forming Giants in the Trees.

In Australia, there was another group called &quot;Eyes Adrift&quot;, and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album &quot;Bud, Curt &amp; Krist&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, CAST-256 (or CAST6) is a symmetric-key block cipher published in June 1998. It was submitted as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); however, it was not among the five AES finalists. It is an extension of an earlier cipher, CAST-128; both were designed according to the &quot;CAST&quot; design methodology invented by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares. Howard Heys and Michael Wiener also contributed to the design.

CAST-256 uses the same elements as CAST-128, including S-boxes, but is adapted for a block size of 128 bits ‚Äì twice the size of its 64-bit predecessor. (A similar construction occurred in the evolution of RC5 into RC6). Acceptable key sizes are 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. CAST-256 is composed of 48 rounds, sometimes described as 12 &quot;quad-rounds&quot;, arranged in a generalized Feistel network.

In RFC 2612, the authors state that, &quot;The CAST-256 cipher described in this document is available worldwide on a royalty-free and licence-free basis for commercial and non-commercial uses.&quot;

Currently, the best public cryptanalysis of CAST-256 in the standard single secret key setting that works for all keys is the zero-correlation cryptanalysis breaking 28 rounds with 2246.9 time and 298.8 data.

<text>John Thornton Kirkland (August 17, 1770 ‚Äì April 26, 1840) was an American Unitarian Congregational clergyman who served as President of Harvard University from 1810 to 1828. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Hasty Pudding. He is remembered chiefly for his major renovations to the university structure and the so-called &quot;Augustan Age&quot; that Harvard went through under his leadership. Kirkland House, one of Harvard&#x27;s undergraduate &quot;houses,&quot; or residence halls, was named in his honor.

==Biography==
John and his twin brother, George, were born at Herkimer, New York, August 17, 1770. Their parents were Rev. Dr. Samuel Kirkland and his wife, Jerusha Bingham Kirkland. She was a niece of Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, D. D.

John Kirkland studied as a child at Andover and thereafter enrolled at Harvard College at the age of 15. He finished his degree there and noted in a brief autobiography that he had achieved excellence and received recognition from his professors there but also had &quot;wasted much time, much money, some virtue, and some health.&quot; He was particularly noteworthy in his studies of Latin and metaphysical sciences.

Kirkland&#x27;s studies were briefly interrupted by a stint in the military during Shay&#x27;s Rebellion in the winter of 1787, when he served under General Benjamin Lincoln. His patriotism was fervent and often discussed in both his speeches and later biographies on his life.

Kirkland finished his degree at Harvard in 1789 and was then enlisted as head tutor of metaphysical studies. He maintained this role until 1794, when he was invited to serve as pastor of the New South Church, a role he would fill for 16 years.

In 1810, Kirkland was elected President of Harvard University. He served as president for 18 years, and retired from the position in 1828 after suffering a stroke and a period of bad health. His resignation came as a complete shock to the community. He was remembered fondly by his students as a thoughtful, genuine, and amiable man who was more a friend than a superior.

Kirkland&#x27;s presidency is thought by some to be one of the greatest in the university&#x27;s history. It has been described as the &quot;Augustan Age&quot; of Harvard, as he oversaw an enormous overhauling of the university&#x27;s finances, operation, and curriculum. He served with very little controversy, a record marred mostly by the so-called &quot;Great Rebellion&quot; in 1820 that saw almost an entire class expelled and a personal conflict with Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch, to whom some at the time attributed Kirkland&#x27;s resignation.

Oliver Wendell Holmes describes him thus, in his study of Ralph Waldo Emerson: &quot;His &#x27;shining morning face&#x27; was round as a baby&#x27;s, and talked as pleasantly as his voice did, with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation... It was of him that the story was always told,--it may be as old as the invention of printing,--that he threw his sermons into a barrel, where they went to pieces and got mixed up, and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon, and patched the leaves together as he best might.&quot;

His contemporary George Ticknor described Kirkland&#x27;s sermons as &quot;full of intellectual wealth and practical wisdom, with sometimes a quaintness that bordered on humor.&quot;

Kirkland served as pastor of the New South Church in Boston, 1794‚Äì1810. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1799.
Kirkland was a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1812.
His wife Elizabeth Cabot was the daughter of Congressman George Cabot.

== Works ==
Kirkland left behind many speeches, sermons, and dialogue over his lengthy career. He also left behind numerous letters, mostly to his nephew, which are preserved in various archives around the country. Harvard University&#x27;s archives hold most of his documents relating to his term as President of the university. He had a few preferred publishers, most notably Jeremy Belknap, at whose funeral Kirkland delivered the eulogy. He left behind a small autobiography, written shortly after he graduated from Harvard. Some notable works include:

(1795) &#x27;A Sermon, Preached before the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company.&#x27;

(1800) &#x27;A Discourse Occasioned by the Death of General George Washington.&#x27;

(1816) &#x27;A Discourse, Presented before His Excellency Caleb Strong.&#x27;

<text>The New Jersey Cardinals were a Short-Season A minor league baseball team affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals. They were a member of the New York‚ÄìPenn League and played at Skylands Park in Augusta, New Jersey from 1994‚Äì2005.

==History==
The team&#x27;s origins began in 1981 as the Erie Cardinals which were also a Cardinals&#x27; affiliate which played at Ainsworth Field in Erie, Pennsylvania from 1981‚Äì1987. The Erie Cardinals were then relocated to Hamilton, Ontario to become the Hamilton Redbirds by Albany businessman Joe Vellano. After the relocation, the team remained as a Cardinals&#x27; affiliate. The team played in Hamilton, Ontario from 1988‚Äì1992. In 1991, Vellano sold the Redbirds to a limited partnership headed by Barry Gordon and Marc Klee. Gordon and Klee planned to relocate the team to New Jersey where partner Rob Hillard was heading up management of the stadium. The Redbirds spent a lame duck season in Hamilton.

In the interim, the team relocated to Glens Falls, New York to become the Glens Falls Redbirds where former owner Jack Tracz managed the interim operation. The team played at East Field for the 1993 season only. After the 1993 season, the Glens Falls Redbirds relocated to Sussex County, NJ to become the New Jersey Cardinals, despite construction delays and apparent mismanagement by the stadium group which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 120 days before the start of the season. The new park opened on schedule in large part due to the ownership and management of the Cardinals which was headed by Gordon and Klee&#x27;s general manager Tony Torre. Torre partnered with a prominent local attorney, Kevin Kelly and the two kept the project moving along with Gordon and Klee&#x27;s open checkbook. The New Jersey Cardinals put together a 43‚Äì32 regular-season mark, and then defeated the Jamestown Jammers, 2 games to 1, and the Auburn Astros, 2 games to 0, to win the league title. The achievement was culminated when Torre approached Frankford township mayor Carol Ann Kristensen to change the club&#x27;s official address to &quot;94 Championship Place&quot;. The Cardinals had one of their best player drafts the following year, and several future stars, including Matt Morris, passed through Augusta in 1995.

Over the next nine seasons, however, the Cardinals experienced only one more winning season, going 39‚Äì37 in 2002, before their relocation. While the team suffered through several losing seasons, they quietly established new standards for Minor League Baseball attendance. Utica Blue Sox owner and former Minnesota Twins beat writer Bob Fowler once said, &quot;The Cardinals through Torre took the NY-Penn League to new standards.&quot; In 2004, the Cards made a late-season run and finished with a 41‚Äì34 record, but still failed to qualify for the league playoffs. In spite an incomplete ballpark the New Jersey Cardinals shattered the NY-Penn League attendance record in 1994, a record that was established in 1947 when the league played a 120-game schedule. The following season the Cardinals attendance soared averaging 4,700 fans per game in their 4,200 seat park. The club continued to draw well drawing 1 million fans faster than any team in NY-Penn League history. The only general manager in the club&#x27;s 12-year history, Torre popularized the utilization of split double headers and a number of innovative promotions including the Headless Bobble Head Doll, color TV giveaways and ethnic entertainment. At one point the Streit &amp; Smith Sports &amp; Business Journal listed Skylands Park in the Top 25 professional facilities in North America with attendance beyond their seating capacity.

With the arrival of competition in the form of additional teams in the New York metropolitan area and further stadium mismanagement attendance began to slip. The Cardinals drew a league-leading 142,417 fans in their inaugural season, following that up with 157,557 in 1995, but 115,342 in 2004. The team produced a number of Major League stars including Matt Morris, Dan Haren, Coco Crisp, Adam Kennedy, Eliezer Alfonzo, Skip Schumaker and NFL quarterback Chad Hutchinson.

==Relocation==
Following the 2005 season, the owners agreed to sell the New Jersey Cardinals. The group that purchased the team is headed by the principal partners of the Altoona Curve, a Double-A Eastern League baseball team. The new owners relocated the New Jersey Cardinals to the brand new, 6,000-seat Medlar Field in University Park, Pennsylvania which is located right outside of State College, Pennsylvania, where the team would play at in the 2006 season. After the relocation, the New Jersey Cardinals were then renamed the State College Spikes. Following the first year of the franchise as the Spikes, the St. Louis Cardinals switched affiliations to the Batavia Muckdogs, a former affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Spikes then became the Class-A Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates which lasted from 2006‚Äì2012. The Spikes switched affiliations from the Pirates back to the Cardinals for the 2013 season.

<doc id="612166" wikidata="Q753931" url="?curid=612166" title="Atchafalaya River">
<text>The Atchafalaya River ( , ) is a distributary of the Mississippi River and Red River in south central Louisiana in the United States. It flows south, just west of the Mississippi River, and is the fifth largest river in North America, by discharge. The name &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; comes from Choctaw for &#x27;long river&#x27;, from , &#x27;river&#x27;, and , &#x27;long&#x27;.

==Atchafalaya Basin==
The Atchafalaya River is navigable and provides a significant industrial shipping channel for the state of Louisiana. It is the cultural heart of the Cajun Country.

The maintenance of the river as a navigable channel of the Mississippi River has been a significant project of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for more than a century. Natural development of the river channel, coupled with channel training and maintenance for flood control and navigation, have combined to isolate the river from the swamp. The river valley forms the Atchafalaya Basin and Atchafalaya Swamp located in southern Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico.

The Atchafalaya became a main distributary of the Mississippi in 1839 to 1849 when locals removed a huge log jam (the Great Raft) that was obstructing the Atchafalaya River.

==Old River Control Structure==

The river is formed near Simmesport at the confluence of the Red River with the Mississippi, where the Mississippi connects to the Red River by the canalized Old River (part of the Old River Control Structure). It receives 30% of the combined flow of the Red and Mississippi Rivers. (The remaining 70% continues down the Mississippi River.) The volume the Atchafalaya receives from the Mississippi is controlled by the Old River Control Structure, a system of a low-sill structure, an auxiliary structure, an overbank structure, a navigation lock, and a power plant near Red River Landing, Louisiana. In times of extreme flooding, the Morganza Spillway further downstream is also used to regulate volume.

In 1942 part of the flow of the Atchafalaya River was diverted through Wax Lake to the Gulf of Mexico further west.

During the 2011 Mississippi River floods, the Old River complex was discharging more than into the Atchafalaya River, and the Morganza Floodway was discharging one-fourth of its capacity. If the Mississippi were allowed to flow freely, the shorter and steeper Atchafalaya would capture the main flow of the Mississippi, permitting the river to bypass its current path through the important ports of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Despite control efforts, some researchers believe the likelihood of this event increases each year due to natural forces inherent to river deltas.
The Atchafalaya River meanders south as a channel of the Mississippi, through extensive levees and floodways, past Morgan City, and empties into the Gulf in Atchafalaya Bay approximately south of Morgan City. Since the late 20th century, the river has been forming a new delta in the bay, the only place on the Louisiana coastline that is gaining ground rather than eroding.

==Atchafalaya National Heritage Area==
The river&#x27;s valley was designated Atchafalaya National Heritage Area in 2006.

<doc id="612177" wikidata="Q9704508" url="?curid=612177" title="Neidpath Castle">
<text>Neidpath Castle is an L-plan rubble-built tower house, overlooking the River Tweed about west of Peebles in the Borders of Scotland. The castle is both a wedding venue and filming location and can be viewed by appointment.

==History==
An early castle was probably built here by Simon Fraser of Oliver Castle between 1263 and 1266, while he held the office of High Sheriff of Tweeddale. The barony of Neidpath was acquired by the Hay family, through marriage in the early 14th century to the heiress Margaret, a daughter of the sheriff&#x27;s son, Simon Fraser of Oliver and Neidpath. Sir William de Haya (d.c.1390) probably built the present castle in the late 14th century. It was held by them until the 17th century, although Sir William&#x27;s son, Sir Thomas Hay, married the daughter and heiress of Sir Hugh Gifford of Yester, acquiring Yester Castle, which became the principal family seat, although Neidpath continued to be used. It was visited by Mary, Queen of Scots in 1563, and by her son James VI in 1587.

In 1645, Neidpath was garrisoned against the Royalist forces of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, although the following year, John Hay of Yester joined the King&#x27;s party, and was created 1st Earl of Tweeddale by King Charles II. During Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s invasion of Scotland in 1650, Neidpath was attacked. Mike Salter states that the castle was surrendered without a fight, although other sources suggest that it required the longest assault on any stronghold south of the River Forth to force it to surrender. James Taylor, writing in 1887, states that the 13th-century tower was demolished by artillery during the siege and the Listed building report notes that there was damage to the west wing. During the 1660s, the 2nd Earl of Tweeddale remodelled the castle, and constructed outbuildings. The 2nd Earl was an agricultural &quot;improver&quot;, who planted an avenue of yews, of which one side remains. However, he was declared bankrupt, and sold Neidpath to William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry in 1686.

In 1693, Queensberry gave the castle to his second son William Douglas, later the 1st Earl of March. His son William, the 2nd Earl, made alterations to the castle in the 18th century. The 3rd Earl inherited the title and estates of the Duke of Queensberry in 1778, and subsequently let Neidpath to tenants. These included the philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson. The castle suffered neglect, however, and by 1790 the upper storeys of the wing had collapsed. William Wordsworth and Walter Scott both visited the castle in 1803; Wordsworth was appalled at the felling of &quot;a brotherhood of venerable Trees&quot; writing a sonnet beginning &quot;Degenerate Douglas! oh, the unworthy Lord.&quot; On the death of the Duke in 1810, the castle, along with the earldom of March, was inherited by the Earl of Wemyss, although the dukedom went to the Scotts of Buccleuch. Neidpath still belongs to Earl of Wemyss; the Earl&#x27;s heir takes his courtesy title, Lord Neidpath, from it.

==Description==
Neidpath Castle is a tall L-plan tower house, one leg of the L being very short. It has rounded corners. The battlements are roofed and the sentry walk is a balustraded balcony. There are few windows, and two still have their iron bar protection. Inside, the basement and the first-floor hall are vaulted, and the hall is further divided by a wooden floor into two storeys. Other features include a pit dungeon, and some small exhibitions of artifacts found in the locale. There are remains of a partly walled garden. The archway is decorated with both the goats head emblem of the Hays and the strawberries of the Frasers.
==Gardens==

A series of five terraces, set at 8m centres, lies to the south-east and east of the castle. Originally serving as ornate garden terraces these were apparently enclosed by a wall which was recorded in 1581 and listed as a &quot;sloping parterre&quot; in 1815. Between 1682 and 1686 the terraces were remodelled and a summe house was built.

==Traditions==
The castle is said to be haunted by the ghost of Jean Douglas, referred to by Walter Scott in his poem as &quot;the Maid of Neidpath&quot;, the youngest daughter of William Douglas, Earl of March. Forbidden to marry the son of the laird of Tushielaw, who was considered below her station, she while her lover was sent away. When he returned she was so wasted that he did not recognise her, causing her to die of a broken heart. She is reputed to appear clad in a full-length brown dress with a large white collar.

==Recent history==
Neidpath has been used as a location for many films and television series, including &quot;&quot; starring Jason Connery and directed by David Winning, which was filmed in September and October 1997. It also was used for the series of Sam and Colby in 2019.

<doc id="612184" wikidata="Q2472954" url="?curid=612184" title="Stamp duty">
<text>Stamp duty is a tax that is levied on single property purchases or documents (including, historically, the majority of legal documents such as cheques, receipts, military commissions, marriage licences and land transactions). Historically, a physical revenue stamp had to be attached to or impressed upon the document to show that stamp duty had been paid before the document was legally effective. More modern versions of the tax no longer require an actual stamp.

The duty is thought to have originated in Venice in 1604, being introduced (or re-invented) in Spain in the 1610s, the Spanish Netherlands in the 1620s, France in 1651, and England in 1694.

==Usage by country==
===Australia===

The Australian Federal Government does not levy stamp duty. However, stamp duties are levied by the Australian states on various instruments (written documents) and transactions. Stamp duty laws can differ significantly between all eight jurisdictions. The rates of stamp duty also differ between the jurisdictions (typically up to 5.5%) as do the nature of instruments and transactions subject to duty. Some jurisdictions no longer require a physical document to attract what is now often referred to as &quot;transaction duty&quot;.

Major forms of duty include transfer duty on the purchase of land (both freehold and leasehold), buildings, fixtures, plant and equipment, intangible business assets (such as goodwill and intellectual property) debts and other types of dutiable property. Another key type of duty is landholder duty, which is imposed on the acquisition of shares in a company or units in a trust that holds land above a certain value threshold.

===Denmark===
A temporary stamp duty was introduced in 1657 to finance the war with Sweden. It was made permanent in 1660 and remains on the statute book although it has been substantially altered. Most stamp duties were abolished from 1 January 2000 and the present act only provides for stamp duties on insurance policies. Stamp duties on land registration were renamed and transferred to a separate statute but remain essentially the same, i.e. 0.6% on deeds and 1.5% loans secured against real estate.

===European Union===
Stamp duty in the EU is limited in scope by the Capital Duties Directive (Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital). This states that transactions subject to capital duty shall only be taxable in the Member State in whose territory the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated at the time when such transactions take place. When the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated in a third country and its registered office is situated in a Member State, transactions subject to capital duty shall be taxable in the Member State where the registered office is situated. When the registered office and the effective centre of management of a capital company are situated in a third country, the supplying of fixed or working capital to a branch situated in a Member State may be taxed in the Member State in whose territory the branch is situated.

The spirit of the Council Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital is that capital duty interferes with the free movement of capital, and it prohibits capital duties altogether on the issue of securities (as opposed to the transfer). The Directive acknowledges that the best solution would be to abolish the duty, but allows those Member States that charged the duty as at 1 January 2006 may continue to do so under strict conditions. With this stamp duty Directive, Member States may not levy indirect tax on the raising of capital to capital companies in:

* contributions of capital;
* loans or services provided as part of contributions of capital;
* registration or other formalities required before commencing business because of the company&#x27;s legal form;
* alteration of the instruments constituting the company, particularly when involving the conversion into a different type of company, the transfer of centre of effective management or registered office from one Member State to another, a change in the company&#x27;s objects or the extension of its period of existence;
* restructuring operations.

Indirect taxes are also entirely prohibited on the issue of certain securities and debentures.

===Greece===
Greece, the fee was introduced by Legislative Decree 4755 Official Gazette ŒëŒÑ164/15.5.1930 which was replaced by P.D. 28.7.1931/1931, also known as the Stamp Duties Code, in view of the impending bankruptcy. It stipulated that all loan contracts were subject to a 3.6% fee. On August 9, 2024, the bill was put to public consultation by the Ministry of National Economy and Finance which abolishes the stamp duty on more than 600 transactions and introduces the digital transaction fee on transactions, which remains the fee.

===Hong Kong===

According to Schedule 1 of Hong Kong Stamp Duty Ordinance Cap.117 (SDO), Stamp duty applies to some legal binding documents as classified into 4 heads:
* Head 1: All sale or lease transactions in Hong Kong immovable property.
* Head 2: The transfer of Hong Kong Stock.
* Head 3: All Hong Kong bearer instruments.
* Head 4: Any duplicates and counterparts of the above documents.

One example is shares of companies which are either incorporated in Hong Kong or listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Other than the said shares, HK Stock is defined as shares and marketable securities, units in unit trusts, and rights to subscribe for or to be allotted stock. Stamp duty on a conveyance on sale of land is charged at progressive rates ranging from 1.5% to 8.5% of the amount of consideration. The maximum rate of 8.5% applies where the consideration exceeds HK$21,739,130.

In addition, in response to the overheated property market, the Government has proposed in 2010 and 2012 two further types of stamp duties in respect of conveyances on sale of land:
* Head 1AA / 1B: Special Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties resold within 3 years after purchase)
* Head 1AAB / 1C: Buyer&#x27;s Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties purchased by non-Hong Kong Permanent Residents or companies)

The Special Stamp Duty was enacted by the Legislative Council on 29 June 2011 and would take effect from 20 November 2010. An enhanced rate of the Special Stamp Duty and the Buyer&#x27;s Stamp Duty was enacted by the Legislative Council on 27 February 2014 but would take effect retrospectively from 27 October 2012.

The government regularly updates its Stamp Duty laws and in addition to the above, several other amendments have now been published which are also aimed at cooling the property market. Third party calculators make it easier to understand the complex set of rules, making it easier to under the latest cost of buying or selling.

Real Estate Agencies do usually arrange the stamping for Tenancy Agreements for residential apartments.

Hong Kong Government, through the Inland Revenue Department, also provides e-stamping with the same legal status as conventional stamp.

=== India ===
Indian laws require stamp duty payments on a limited category of transaction documents. Broadly, documents affecting rights and titles to property require stamp duties to be paid. The central government requires stamp duty to be paid on several classes of transaction documents, primarily focused on securities, under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. In addition, stamp duty may be charged by the state government for other transactions depending on state-specific legislation. For example, Maharashtra state&#x27;s stamp duty law is governed by the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 (Bombay Act LX of 1958 ).

=== Indonesia ===
Stamp duty (&quot;meterai&quot;) is in use in Indonesia on a variety of legal documents. It continues to be necessary to stamp a document which is used to describe a civil instance or as evidence in court according to Law No. 10/2020 on Stamp Duty (&quot;UU No. 10 Tahun 2020 Tentang Bea Meterai&quot;).
Indonesian government, through Ministry of Finance, also launched electronic stamp duty (&quot;e-meterai&quot;) on October 1, 2021. This form of stamp duty affixed to digital documents such as PDF file in the form of special secure QR code developed by Perum Peruri. The digital document and its printed form is regarded as valid legal evidence according to Law No. 11/2008 on Information and Electronic Transactions (&quot;UU No. 11 Tahun 2008 Tentang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik&quot;).

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland stamp duties are levied on various items including (but not limited to) credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, cheques, property transfers, and certain court documents. Stamp duty was formerly a graduated progressive tax with the more expensive the house bought the greater the stamp duty rate. The top rate slowly increased from 0.5% in 1882 to 3% in 1947, 5% in 1973, 6% in 1975, reaching its peak at 9% in 1997. The budget of 2008 inaugurated a series of rate reductions. After 2011 the stamp duty tax is set at 1% for residential properties up to ‚Ç¨1 million and 2% on the remaining amount. Non-residential real property, building, insurance policies, the intangible business property goodwill are taxed at 2%. A lease for property of any type is taxed according to the lease duration, 1% of the average annual rent, or the market rate whichever is greater, if 35 years or less, 6% up to 100 years, and 12% for a lease of more than 100 years duration. Counterparts (duplicate copies) of documents are taxed the lesser of ‚Ç¨12.50 or the duty on the original document. The value of property for stamp duty excludes VAT. Gifts are taxed at market value. Several exemptions including those for gifts between close relatives and first time home buyers expired in 2010. The transfer of stocks and marketable securities is taxed at 1% if over ‚Ç¨1,000 or if a gift. Stock warrants in bearer form are taxed at 3% of the value of the shares, and the issue of (new) bearer warrants was prohibited effective 1 June 2015.

===Singapore===
From 1998, stamp duty in Singapore only applies to documents relating to immovable property, stocks and shares. Purchases of Singapore property or shares traded on the Singapore Exchange, are subject to stamp duty. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) mandates stamp duty payment within 14 days from signing of the document if done in Singapore and 30 days if the document is signed overseas. Failure in payment within the fixed time entails heavy penalty.

Applicable rates and more information can be obtained from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Legislation covering Singapore Stamp Duties are found in the Stamp Duties Act.

===Sweden===
Swedish law applies a stamp duty on property deeds, at 1.5% of the purchase value. In addition, a stamp duty of 2.0% is levied on new mortgage securities (&quot;pantbrev&quot;) for properties.

===United Kingdom===
&quot;Stamp Duty Reserve Tax&quot; (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer certain shares and other securities in 1986, albeit with a relief for intermediaries such as market makers and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange. &quot;Stamp Duty Land Tax&quot; (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land and property transactions from 1 December 2003. SDLT is not a stamp duty, but a form of self-assessed transfer tax charged on &quot;land transactions&quot;.

On 24 March 2010, Chancellor Alistair Darling introduced two significant changes to UK Stamp Duty Land Tax. For first-time buyers purchasing a property under ¬£250,000, Stamp Duty Land Tax was abolished for the next two years. This measure was offset by a rise from 4% to 5% in Stamp Duty Land Tax on residential properties costing more than ¬£1 million.

Further reforms were announced in December 2014, so that rates are now paid only on the part of the property price within each tax band.

In the 2015 Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that buyers of second homes (whether Buy to let or holiday homes) would pay an additional 3% with effect from April 2016.

The Budget in 2017 abolished stamp duty for first-time home buyers in England and Wales purchasing homes up to ¬£300,000, saving first-time buyers up to ¬£5,000. Additionally, first-time buyers spending up to ¬£500,000 will only pay stamp duty at 5% on the amount in excess of ¬£300,000. Those spending over ¬£500,000 will pay full stamp duty.

Government defines first-time buyers as &quot;... an individual or individuals who have never owned an interest in a residential property in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world and who intends to occupy the property as their main residence.&quot;

Stamp Duty Land Tax only applies throughout England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, SDLT was replaced by Land and Buildings Transaction Tax on April 1, 2015. In Wales, Land Transaction Tax was introduced in May 2018.

===United States===
Although the federal government formerly imposed various documentary stamp taxes on deeds, notes, insurance premiums and other transactional documents, in modern times such taxes are only imposed by states. Typically when real estate is transferred or sold, a real estate transfer tax will be collected at the time of registration of the deed in the public records. In addition, many states impose a tax on mortgages or other instruments securing loans against real property. This tax, known variously as a &quot;mortgage tax&quot;, &quot;intangibles tax&quot;, or &quot;documentary stamp tax&quot;, is also usually collected at the time of registration of the mortgage or deed of trust with the recording authority.

<text>In finance, a dead cat bounce is a small, brief recovery in the price of a declining stock. Derived from the idea that &quot;even a dead cat will bounce if it falls from a great height&quot;, the phrase is also popularly applied to any case where a subject experiences a brief resurgence during or following a severe decline. This may also be known as a &quot;sucker rally&quot;.

==History==
The earliest citation of the phrase in the news media dates to December 1985 when the Singaporean and Malaysian stock markets bounced back after a hard fall during the recession of that year. Journalists Chris Sherwell and Wong Sulong of the London-based &quot;Financial Times&quot; were quoted as saying the market rise was &quot;what we call a dead cat bounce&quot;. Both the Singaporean and Malaysian economies continued to fall after the quote, although both economies recovered in the following years.

The phrase was used again the following year about falling oil prices. In the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. proposed that &quot;Beware the Dead Cat Bounce&quot; be printed on bumper stickers and followed up with a graphic explanation. This quote was referenced throughout the 1990s and became widely used in the 2000s.

The phrase is also used in political circles for a candidate or policy that shows a small positive bounce in approval after a hard and fast decline.

==Variations and usage==

The standard usage of the term refers to a short rise in the price of a stock that has suffered a fall. In other instances, the term is used exclusively to refer to securities or stocks that are considered to be of low value. First, the securities have poor past performance. Second, the decline is &quot;correct&quot; in that the underlying business is weak (e.g. declining sales or shaky financials). Along with this, it is doubtful that the security will recover with better conditions (overall market or economy).

Some variations on the definition of the term include:

*A stock in a severe decline has a sharp bounce off the lows.
*A small upward price movement in a bear market after which the market continues to fall.

===Technical analysis===
A &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; price pattern may be used as a part of the technical analysis method of stock trading. Technical analysis describes a dead cat bounce as a continuation pattern in which a reversal of the current decline occurs followed by a significant price recovery. The price fails to continue upward and instead falls again downwards, often surpassing the previous low. This phenomenon can be difficult to identify at the time of occurrence, and like market peaks and troughs, it is usually only with hindsight that the pattern is able to be recognised.

==Behavioural finance perspective==
The phenomenon known as a dead cat bounce can be illustrated partly by the irrational and emotional behaviour of the market participants or traders. According to this theory, investors can sometimes not be rational or objective in their timing of the market; however, they are influenced by cognitive biases and emotions influencing and leading to herd behaviour, overreaction and underreaction. A dead cat bounce might prey on some of the following investor biases: 

=== Anchoring ===
Anchoring occurs from relying too much on a fixed reference point rather than adjusting expectations based on updated information. For example, a high or low occurred previously instead of looking at the macro-environmental factors. Some investors might take this information to mean that the stock/commodity is over or undervalued after a sharp decline and hope for a quick rebound in the form of a V-bottom. 

=== Confirmation bias ===
Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret information that confirms an individual‚Äôs pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses and ignore/dismiss significant contradictory evidence. This leads to investors selectively choosing what information they believe as long as it supports their optimistic outlook for the chosen stock. Thus, they downplay the crucial negative information as rumour or unimportant. 

=== Overconfidence ===
Overconfidence results from overestimating one&#x27;s ability or knowledge of a particular stock or macro-environment and underestimating the associated uncertainty and risks. Overconfidence results in investors not diversifying, taking on too much risk or refusing to sell stocks at a stop-loss level. 

These biases, either by themselves or in combination, can create a feedback loop in which the market is amplified in volatility and unpredictability as larger and larger amounts of investors react to the same signals and sentiments. The dead cat bounce is a prime example of a rebound fuelled by traders and speculators who bet on their optimistic views rather than the intrinsic or actual value of the stock. This results in a false sense of recovery as the stock begins to rally, and the subsequent drop in value reflects the actual supply and demand dynamics of the stock value. 

To counteract these biases, implement a disciplined and evidence-based approach to investing, look at a longer time frame, or diversify in an index fund. These methods rely more on an objective set of criteria, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, the dividend yield, or the market capitalisation, to assess the relative attractiveness of a stock or market rather than trading based on emotion. Furthermore, they emphasise how important it is to diversify, be patient, and have a longer-term perspective which can reduce the impact and importance of short-term fluctuations and noise. By understanding the psychological traps that can lead to a dead cat bounce, investors can make achieving their financial goals more likely and avoid costly errors.

== Causes ==
The causes behind a dead cat bounce are largely the result of these effects. It is often a combination of these effects which result in the dead cat bounce phenomenon.

=== Technical factors ===
Technical factors, such as a short position from many firms, can help in the formation of a dead cat bounce. As many investors buy back their shares to close a short position, the stock receives a temporary increase in demand, driving up the price of the stock. Additionally, if the stock has an established history of a stable, continuous and periodic fluctuation between a support price and a resistance price, a low stock price may result in investors buying shares under the belief that the stock price is still following the same trend. This has the same effect as the short covering where the price receives a short boost.

=== News and events === 
Positive news with relevancy to the stock can provide a temporary boost of investor sentiment. This can be the result of a partnership agreement or a new product. In turn, this provides a short boost to the demand for the stock even though the underlying cause of the decline in price has not changed.

=== Market sentiment ===
The market sentiment refers to the attitude of investors towards a market. Should many stocks within the same financial market show a positive trend, then the entire financial market may be favored by investors. A &quot;bullish&quot; market refers to a market which is predicted to undergo a positive price movement. Should an entire market experience an increase in demand, even stocks with a falling price can be positively benefited. 

=== Market manipulation ===
Tactics used by market manipulators may be used to temporarily inflate prices in an effort of personal gain. Tactics such as a spreading false rumors or engaging in a pump-and-dump will result in a short-lived increase in price.

<text>The Peninsula Hong Kong is a colonial-style luxury hotel located in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. It is the flagship property of The Peninsula Hotels group, part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Group. The hotel opened in 1928 and was the first under The Peninsula brand. Expanded in 1994, the hotel combines colonial and modern elements, and is notable for its large fleet of Rolls-Royces painted a distinctive &quot;Peninsula green&quot;.
==History==

Founded by members of the Kadoorie family, The Peninsula was built with the idea that it would be &quot;the finest hotel east of Suez&quot;. Originally planned for a 1924 opening, the hotel opened on 11 December 1928 and was the successor of Hongkong Hotel. The Peninsula was located in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong at the junction of Nathan Road and Salisbury Road, directly opposite the quays where ocean liner passengers disembarked and near the terminus of the Kowloon-Canton railway. 

Following the opening of the hotel, The Peninsula held Sunday concerts, nightly dinners on the terrace and twice-weekly dinners in the Rose Room. Dinner dances were held every night, with regular Afternoon Tea Dances. The Peninsula then became a popular meeting place for the entire community. It also became a place to spot celebrities. Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard, who were Hollywood stars of the 1930s classic &quot;Modern Times&quot;, were among the hotel&#x27;s guests.

On 25 December 1941, at the end of the Battle of Hong Kong, British colonial officials led by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Aitchison Young, surrendered in person at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of The Peninsula. The Governor was confined for two months in one of the hotel suites before being transferred to a prison in Shanghai. The resort was then renamed , and the rooms were reserved for Japanese officers and high-ranking dignitaries.

In his book &quot;God Is My Co-Pilot&quot;, Colonel Robert Lee Scott Jr., USAAF, commander of the 23rd Fighter Group, China Air Task Force, described in detail an aerial raid he led on the Japanese shipping anchored in Hong Kong harbour, conducted 25 October 1942, and the lone attack he personally made in his Curtiss P-40K Warhawk (nicknamed &quot;Old Exterminator&quot;) upon the famous Peninsula hotel:
&quot;So, I looped above Victoria Harbour and drove for the Peninsula Hotel. My tracers ripped into the shining plate-glass of the penthouses on its top, and I saw the broken windows cascade like snow to the streets, many floors below. I laughed, for I knew that behind those windows were Japanese high officers, enjoying that modern hotel. When I got closer, I could see uniformed figures going down the fire escapes, and I shot at them...I turned for one more run on the packed fire escapes filled with Jap soldiers, but my next burst ended very suddenly. I was out of ammunition.&quot;
It was restored to its original name after Japan was defeated and the British regained control of the colony. The hotel today is part of the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels group headed by Sir Michael Kadoorie and is the flagship property of The Peninsula Hotels group.

=== 1994 expansion ===

In 1994, the hotel was expanded with a 30-storey tower of a similar architectural style as the existing building. The facade of the existing hotel building was preserved, including the forecourt, the lobby and the front facade. The hotel remained in operation while construction took place.

The new Peninsula Tower is topped with a helipad. It is used to transport VIP guests to the Hong Kong International Airport, a seven-minute flight away. World-record holding Australian helicopter pilot Dick Smith, accompanied by Director-General Peter K N Lok of the Civil Aviation Department, piloted the inaugural certifying helicopter flight onto the helipad in 1994.

The redevelopment increased the total number of rooms to 300 with the addition of 132 rooms and suites. Other new features included 10 floors of office space, shops and hotel facilities.

=== 2012 refurbishment ===
To celebrate the hotel&#x27;s 85th anniversary in April 2013, it launched a refurbishment programme. In September 2012, the first phase of the Peninsula Tower was completed. New features include digital enhancements ranging from touch-screen tablets, a DVD library of 3D movies to high-definition televisions. The decor of the rooms is in pared-down Oriental chic, with plain cream upholstery, vintage luggage-inspired drawer handles and Chinese ink painting-inspired ornaments. However the renovation did not include the iconic lobby, restaurants and bars which all remained unchanged.

==Architecture and facilities==
The Peninsula is designed in the Italianate style. The lobby&#x27;s design is a combination of Edwardian and Second Empire styles and includes ornamental stained glass, woodwork, and carpets and draperies dating from 1928.

===Restaurants and bars===
The hotel&#x27;s food and beverage outlets include the gourmet French restaurant Gaddi&#x27;s, which has one of the first chef&#x27;s tables in Hong Kong, and the Philippe Starck-designed &#x27;Felix&#x27;. Others are &#x27;Spring Moon&#x27;, &#x27;Imasa&#x27;, and &#x27;Chesa&#x27;, which specialise in Cantonese, Japanese, and Swiss cuisine respectively.

The Lobby serves traditional English-style Afternoon Tea, reminiscent of Hong Kong&#x27;s colonial era.

===Fashion arcade===
The hotel has one of the oldest fashion arcades in Hong Kong. Throughout the years, it has housed international luxury brands such as Chanel, Dior, Herm√®s, Chrome Hearts, Gucci, Prada, Shiatzy Chen, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, Goyard, Franck Muller, Bvlgari, Tiffany &amp; Co., Baccarat, ST Dupont, Harry Winston, Davidoff, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Jacob &amp; Co., and Ralph Lauren. Apart from international fashion houses, it was also home to Hong Kong brands, such as Betty Charnuis Clemos in the 60s, Dickson Poon in the 70s and Joyce Boutique in the 80s.

===Fleet===
Since December 2006, the hotel has had a fleet of 14 long wheelbase Rolls-Royce Phantoms painted in the hotel&#x27;s signature green. It was the largest single order placed with Rolls-Royce in the history of the company. It replaced a fleet of Rolls-Royce Silver Spurs.

==In popular culture==
In the 1974 James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; starring Roger Moore, the hotel&#x27;s fleet of Rolls-Royce Silver Shadows is mentioned.

The hotel was frequently featured in the TV series &quot;Dynasty&quot; and was the site of a number of negotiations over oil leases in the South China Sea. It was also prominently displayed in the 1988 NBC television miniseries &quot;Noble House&quot;. In the same year, Michael Palin visited the Hotel for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

In 2007, The Peninsula was used for a scene in the superhero film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, involving actors Morgan Freeman and Chin Han, who played Lucius Fox and Lau, respectively.

In 2015, The Peninsula was featured in the eleventh episode of &quot;the 27th season of The Amazing Race&quot;, serving as the location of the first route marker of the Hong Kong / Macau leg.

The Spring Moon Chinese restaurant of the hotel is sometimes credited with the invention of XO sauce.

<text>The Enterprise is a Zilog Z80-based home computer announced in 1983, but due to a series of delays, was not commercially available until 1985. It was developed by British company Intelligent Software and marketed by Enterprise Computers.

The specification as released was powerful and one of the higher end in its class (though not by the margin envisaged in 1983). This was due to the use of custom ASICs for graphics and sound which took workload away from the CPU, an extensive implementation of ANSI BASIC and a bank switching system to allow for larger amounts of RAM than the Z80 natively supported. It also featured a distinctive and colourful case design, and promise of multiple expansion options. Its two variants are the Enterprise 64, with 64 KB of RAM, and the Enterprise 128, with 128 KB of RAM.

The machine was renamed several times during development, being known variously as Samurai, Oscar and Elan. Versions can sometimes been found in magazine articles referred to by the preceding monikers. Ultimately, not assisted by release delays and a changing market place, the Enterprise was not commercially successful. The manufacturer called in the receivers in 1986 with significant debt, although old stock continued to be sold through a German partner until well into the 1990s.

== Hardware ==

=== CPU, memory and ASIC chips ===

The Enterprise has a 4 megahertz (MHz) Z80 Central processing unit (CPU), 64 KB (65,536 bytes) or 128 KB of RAM, and 32 KB (32,768 bytes) of internal read-only memory (ROM) that contains the EXOS operating system and a screen editor / word processor. The BASIC programming language was supplied on a 16 KB ROM module.

Two application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips take some of the workload off of the central processor. They are named &quot;Nick&quot; and &quot;Dave&quot; after their designers, Nick Toop, who had previously worked on the Acorn Atom, and Dave Woodfield. &quot;Nick&quot; manages graphics, while &quot;Dave&quot; handles sound and memory paging (bank switching).

A bank switching scheme allows the memory to be expanded to a maximum of 4 megabytes (4,194,304 bytes). The highest 2 address lines from the Z80 are used to select one of the four 8-bit Page Registers in the Dave chip. The output from the selected register is used as the highest 8 bits of the 22-bit address bus, while the lowest 14 bits come directly from the Z80 address bus. Effectively, the 64 KB address space of the Z80 processor is divided into four 16k sections. Any 16k page from the 4 MB address space can be mapped to any of these sections. The lowest two pages (pages 0 and 1) of the 4 MB address space contain system ROM. The next four pages (2 to 5) are reserved for a ROM cartridge (max 64 KB). The top four pages (pages 252 to 255, totaling 64 KB) are used as video RAM, but can be used for storage of program code and data as well. On the 128k model, the additional 64 KB of ram is mapped on pages 248 to 251. The remaining memory space can be used by external devices and memory modules connected to the expansion bus.

=== Keyboard and case ===

The case is unusual in that it contains both a full-sized keyboard with programmable function keys, and a joystick. Its distinctive shape was due to the designers&#x27; desire to break away from customary designs. The low-profile keyboard is constructed with mechanical keycaps on top of a rubber membrane and has a standard layout, but the feel of the keys was disliked by many, or even most people, because the keys weren&#x27;t &quot;full travel&quot;, but had a squishy feel, similar to a Sinclair QL or Spectrum+. The joystick replaces the normal cursor keys, and allows the cursor to be moved diagonally.

Royal College of Art graduates Geoff Hollington and Nick Oakley were responsible for the design, having tendered for this particular contract, and had only seven days to produce the visual design concept. Tooling for production of the casing was also demanded in a rapid timeframe and took five months. Originally, a combination of greys was envisaged for the casing elements, but seeking to avoid the look of office equipment and to appeal to &quot;the lower end of the market&quot;, the eventual dark grey case with red, green and blue keys was chosen.

=== Graphics ===

Enterprise has four hardware graphics modes: 40-column text modes, Lo-Res and Hi-Res bit mapped graphics, and attribute graphics. The OS offers 80-column text via high-resolution graphics mode. Bit mapped graphics modes allow selection between displays of 2, 4, 16 or 256 colours (from a 3-3-2 bit RGB palette), but horizontal resolution decreases as colour depth increases. Interlaced and non-interlaced modes are available. The maximum resolution is pixels interlaced, or pixels non-interlaced. These resolutions permit only a 2-colour display. A 256-colour display has a maximum resolution of . The attribute graphics mode provides a pixel resolution with 16 colours, selectable from a palette of 256.

Multiple pages can be displayed simultaneously on the screen, even if their graphics modes are different. Each page has its own palette, which allows more colours to be displayed onscreen simultaneously. The page height can be larger than the screen or the window it is displayed on. Each page is connected to a channel of the EXOS operating system, so it is possible to write on a hidden page.

=== Sound ===

The sound is handled by the second ASIC chip, &quot;Dave&quot;, and has 3 sound channels plus a noise channel. Each channel&#x27;s sound can be placed freely in the stereo image. Available effects include distortion, low-pass and high-pass filters, and ring modulation.

The Enterprise firmware also provides programmable envelope generators that are more flexible than synthesizers&#x27; traditional ADSR envelope, and allow up to 255 phases to be specified for each envelope. On each phase, the envelope can adjust the sound&#x27;s pitch and stereo balance.

=== Interfaces ===

The Enterprise included an array of connectors far beyond what was common on home computers of the time. There is an RGB output, a RS-232 / RS-423 serial port, a Centronics printer port, two external joystick ports, two cassette tape interfaces, a ROM cartridge slot, and an ordinary expansion port. To save expense, many of the connectors did not use sockets, but instead had simple edge connectors that used the exposed traces at the edge of the printed circuit board.

The BASIC ROM can be replaced by a ROM that emulates a ZX Spectrum 48K, which allows the Enterprise to run the catalogue of thousands of Spectrum BASIC games and any other titles that don&#x27;t access hardware directly; a hardware peripheral was available to provide more complete emulation for other Spectrum titles ‚Äî catching Spectrum hardware accesses and issuing an interrupt so that emulation software can deal with them.

An external floppy drive became available later, and allowed access to CP/M programs, while at the same time being compatible with the MS-DOS disc format and FAT12 file structure (sub-directories etc.).

== Software ==
=== System ROM ===

EXOS (Enterprise Expandable Operating System) is contained in the system ROM, and is based on &quot;channels&quot;. All peripherals are accessed through channels, which allows the programs to treat all input and output devices identically. The system ROM also contains a full-screen editor, which doubles as a simple word processor. It can edit text files and BASIC programs, as well as programs written in other languages. The editor uses the joystick for cursor control.

=== IS-Basic ===

Enterprise does not include BASIC or any other programming language in its internal ROM, unlike most other home computers of the time. Its BASIC interpreter was supplied on a 16k ROM cartridge, and the language can be changed by switching the cartridge, a system similar to that of Acorn&#x27;s BBC Micro.

IS-Basic adheres to the ANSI BASIC standard. It is a fully structured language whose wide set of control structures includes multi-line codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 with codice_4 and codice_5 conditions. The codice_4 condition being at the begin and the codice_5 condition being at the end of the do-loop, and the ability to escape a loop with the codice_8 statement. Procedures and functions can have both reference and value parameters, and local variables. Errors and other exceptions are handled with exception handlers.

IS-Basic has the unique ability to hold multiple programs simultaneously in memory. Each program has a separate set of global variables and line numbers, but the CHAIN statement makes it possible to call one program from another and pass parameters between them. Peripherals can be controlled directly from BASIC, so there is rarely a need to use codice_9 and codice_10 statements.
IS-Basic has the usual commands for drawing dots, lines, circles and ellipses and for filling areas, and supports Logo-style turtle graphics. Sound commands can be entered into a queue, and executed in the background while the program execution continues.

The basic was also noted as being long-winded, an example being the command to clear the screen was commonly abbreviated to codice_11, on the enterprise the command was codice_12 with no abbreviation possible.

=== Other software ===

Several languages besides IS-BASIC, including Forth, Lisp, Pascal and assembly, were available on either ROM cartridge or tape. Basic-to-Basic converters could convert BASIC programs written for other home computers. Some 40 games, from IS and other publishers, were listed in the catalog. IS-DOS, the CP/M compatible operating system, opened access to the wide range of CP/M programs available at that time.

== History ==

After the 1982 introduction of the ZX Spectrum, Hong Kong trading company Locumals commissioned Intelligent Software, headed by international chess player David Levy, to develop a home computer in the UK. During development the machine had the codename &quot;DPC&quot;, which stood for damp-proof course, to confuse potential competitors. The machine was also known by the names &quot;Samurai&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Elan&quot; and &quot;Flan&quot; before the &quot;Enterprise&quot; name was finally chosen. The succession of name changes was mainly due to the discovery of other machines and companies with the chosen name. The odd choice of Flan emerged following the discovery that Elan could not be used (due to complaints from Elan Digital Systems of Crawley) but some documentation had already been produced with that moniker and it was thought the Elan name could easily be modified on printed materials.

Entersoft, modeled after Amstrad&#x27;s AMSOFT, was set up to ensure a steady supply of software for the new machine. Enterprise was announced to the press in September 1983, and some 80,000 machines were pre-ordered by the time of its April 1984 sales launch. The product did not ship until 1985, by which point the UK home computer market was already dominated by the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Acorn BBC Micro with the 16-bit era on the horizon. A successor machine, the PW360, was developed in 1986 to compete against the Amstrad PCW 8256, but the company was by then in severe financial difficulties, and closed down.

The home computer market had changed greatly from the time from the machine was announced to its release date. There had been a downturn, owing to market saturation. Large retailers proved reluctant to stock the machine, and smaller retailers were wary of stocking a machine not supported through the major retail channels. The hardware was still powerful for a home computer of the era, but there was a limited software catalogue and the price was higher than the competition. For example, the Amstrad CPC 464 included a monitor and cassette recorder, was released before the Enterprise, and retailed for less. After the initial manufacturing run of 80,000 units, it is believed that no further units were made, so the Enterprise is among the rarer home computers of the 1980s.

The Enterprise had only minor success in the UK, selling no more that 25,000 units in this region, but did go on to have more impact in other countries. Enterprise Computers UK and Intelligent Software collapsed by 1986 but a German subsidiary survived until 1997 and shipped remaining stock to various countries including Egypt, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic but most notably to Hungary. The Hungarian company Videoton had produced a simplified version of the Enterprise called the TVC under license that was mainly sold into Hungarian education. Hungary was then part of the Eastern Bloc which was subject to export controls and the TVC lacked the specialist Nick and Dave chips. Unsold Enterprise 128 stock though was imported into Hungary in 1987 (despite controls) and the machine became popular in the country, remaining on sale until around 1992. A dedicated cult following for the machine still exists in Hungary.

== Video games ==

Most of the video games for the system are hobbyist ports from ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. There are only 96 commercially released video games.

<doc id="612228" wikidata="Q7186275" url="?curid=612228" title="Philosophy of sex">
<text>Philosophy of sex is an aspect of applied philosophy involved with the study of sex and love. It includes both ethics of phenomena such as prostitution, rape, sexual harassment, sexual identity, the age of consent, homosexuality, and conceptual analysis of more universal questions such as &quot;what is sex?&quot; It also includes matters of sexuality and sexual identity and the ontological status of gender. Leading contemporary philosophers of sex include Alan Soble, Judith Butler, and Raja Halwani.

Contemporary philosophy of sex is sometimes informed by Western feminism. Issues raised by feminists regarding gender differences, sexual politics, and the nature of sexual identity are important questions in the philosophy of sex.

*What is the function of sex?
*What is romantic love?
*Is there an essential characteristic that makes an act sexual?
*Are some sexual acts good and others bad? According to what criteria? Alternatively, can consensual sexual acts be immoral, or are they outside the realm of ethics?
*What is the relationship between sex and biological reproduction? Can one exist without the other?
*Are sexual identities rooted in some fundamental ontological difference (such as biology)?
*Is sexuality a function of gender or biological sex?

==History of the philosophy of sex==

Throughout much of the history of Western philosophy, questions of sex and sexuality have been considered only within the general subject of ethics. There have, however, been deviations from this pattern out of which emerge a tradition of speaking of sexual issues in their own right.

The &quot;Society for the Philosophy of Sex and Love&quot; is a professional group within the membership of the American Philosophical Association.

==Sexual desire==
Moral evaluations of sexual activity are determined by judgments on the nature of the sexual impulse. In this light, philosophies fall into two camps:

A negative understanding of sexuality, such as from Immanuel Kant, believes that sexuality undermines values, and challenges our moral treatment of other persons.
Sex, says Kant, &quot;makes of the loved person an Object of appetite&quot;.
In this understanding, sex is often advised only for the purpose of procreation. Sometimes sexual celibacy is considered to lead to the best, or most moral life.

A positive understanding of sexuality ‚Äì such as from Russell Vannoy, Irving Singer, Bertrand Russell in his &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot; ‚Äì sees sexual activity as pleasing the self and the other at the same time.

== Putative perversions ==
Thomas Nagel proposes that only sexual interactions with mutual sexual arousal are natural to human sexuality. Perverted sexual encounters or events would be those in which this reciprocal arousal is absent, and in which a person remains fully a subject of the sexual experience or fully an object.

<text>Hoogland () is a village and former free-standing municipality in the province of Utrecht in the Netherlands. It is located north of the Amersfoort city centre. The village population is 10,587 people (2006). 

Since 1974, Hoogland has been a part of the municipality of Amersfoort. Until that time, around the 1950s, Hoogland grew vastly in the areas Langenoord and Bieshaar. Nowadays, Hoogland-west is the only outer part of Hoogland which is uncultivated. Although Hoogland got more surrounded by the new housing of Amersfoort (Kattenbroek, Nieuwland and Schothorst), the village characteristics stayed intact.

==Schools==
Hoogland has six primary schools: De Biezen, de Bieshaar, de Berkenschool, De Horizon, de Kosmos and the Langenoord. The schools ‚ÄòDe Biezen‚Äô and ‚Äòde Bieshaar‚Äô are in front of each other. The ‚ÄòBiezen‚Äô is a Roman Catholic school and the ‚ÄòBieshaar‚Äô is a public school. The ‚ÄòBerkenschool‚Äô lies in front of the ‚ÄòBerkenvijver‚Äô (a pond). The ‚ÄòLangenoord‚Äô lies in the part which is called ‚ÄòLangenoord‚Äô. The ‚ÄòHorizon‚Äô is a Reformed school. The ‚ÄôKosmos‚Äô is the school which is in the outer corner of Hoogland.

<doc id="612233" wikidata="Q233583" url="?curid=612233" title="Indo-Pakistani war of 1965">
<text>The Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, also known as the second India‚ÄìPakistan war, was an armed conflict between Pakistan and India that took place from August 1965 to September 1965. The conflict began following Pakistan&#x27;s unsuccessful Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. The seventeen day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armoured vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared through UNSC Resolution 211 following a diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries&#x27; land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001‚Äì2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations.

India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared. However, in terms of aerial warfare, the PAF managed an upper hand over the combat zones despite being numerically inferior. Although the two countries fought to a standoff, the conflict is seen as a strategic and political defeat for Pakistan, as it had not succeeded in fomenting an insurrection in Kashmir and was instead forced to shift gears in the defence of Lahore. India also failed to achieve its objective of military deterrence and did not capitalise on its advantageous military situation before the ceasefire was declared.

Internationally, the war was viewed in the context of the greater Cold War, and resulted in a significant geopolitical shift in the subcontinent. Before the war, the United States and the United Kingdom had been major material allies of both India and Pakistan, as their primary suppliers of military hardware and foreign developmental aid. During and after the conflict, both India and Pakistan felt betrayed by the perceived lack of support by the western powers for their respective positions; those feelings of betrayal were increased with the imposition of an American and British embargo on military aid to the opposing sides. As a consequence, India and Pakistan openly developed closer relationships with the Soviet Union and China, respectively. The perceived negative stance of the western powers during the conflict, and during the 1971 war, has continued to affect relations between the West and the subcontinent. Despite improved relations with the US and Britain since the end of the Cold War, the conflict generated a deep distrust of both countries within the subcontinent which, to an extent, still lingers today.

== Background ==
Since the partition of British India in August 1947, Pakistan and India remained in contention over several issues. Although the Kashmir conflict was the predominant issue dividing the nations, other border disputes existed, most notably over the Rann of Kutch, a barren region in the Indian state of Gujarat. The issue first arose in 1956, which ended with India regaining control over the disputed area. In the 1960s Pakistan received 700 million dollars of military aid from the United States, by signing a defence agreement in 1954, which significantly modernised Pakistan&#x27;s military equipment. After the defeat in 1962 Sino-Indian War, the Indian military was undergoing major changes in personnel and equipment. During this period, despite being numerically smaller than the Indian military, Pakistan&#x27;s armed forces had a qualitative edge in air power and armour over India, which Pakistan sought to use before India completed its defence build-up.

Pakistani soldiers began patrolling in territory controlled by India in January 1965, which was followed by attacks by both countries on each other&#x27;s posts on 8 April 1965. Initially involving border police from both nations, the disputed area soon witnessed intermittent skirmishes between the countries&#x27; armed forces. Pakistan launched Operation Desert Hawk and captured a few Indian posts near the Kanjarkot fort border area. In June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson successfully persuaded both countries to end hostilities. Both countries signed an agreement to settle the disputed border through international arbitration by the International Court of Justice on 30 June 1965. A tribunal was set to resolve the dispute, the verdict which came later in 1968, saw Pakistan awarded of the Rann of Kutch, as against its original claim of . Pakistan&#x27;s purpose for this operation was to assess the response of the Indian government and military and to draw Indian armour southward to Kutch, away from the Punjab and Kashmir region.

After its success in the Rann of Kutch, Pakistan, under the leadership of Muhammad Ayub Khan, believed the Indian Army would be unable to defend itself against a quick military campaign in the disputed territory of Kashmir as the Indian military had suffered a loss to China in 1962 in the Sino-Indian War. Pakistan believed that the population of Kashmir was generally discontented with Indian rule, and that a resistance movement could be ignited by a few infiltrating saboteurs.

== War ==

=== Operation Gibraltar ===

On 5 August 1965, Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control dressed as Kashmiri locals headed for various areas within Kashmir. These infiltrators carried out intelligence collection with the help of locals in cities like Gulmarg and Rajouri. Indian forces, tipped off by the local populace, captured several Pakistani soldiers who revealed that Pakistan was attempting to ignite the resistance movement employing a covert infiltration, code-named Operation Gibraltar. The operation was eventually unsuccessful.

On 6 and 7 August, Indian forces engaged in skirmishes with several columns of Pakistani soldiers, who tried to cut communication lines and mix with the locals during celebrations.

Indian Army crossed the cease fire line on 15 August and captured several previously infiltrated peaks overlooking the Srinagar ‚Äì Leh Highway. Initially, the Indian Army met with considerable success, capturing three important mountain positions after a prolonged artillery barrage. By the end of August, Pakistan had made progress in areas such as Tithwal, Uri and Poonch.

=== Haji Pir pass ===

Wishing to stop the influx of Pakistani forces into the Uri-Poonch bulge, COAS Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri commanded the XV Corps under Lt Gen K. S. Katoch to advance and take over Haji Pir pass. Under the watch of Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh, led by Brig. ZC Bakshi of the 68 Infantry Brigade, Indian forces captured the Haji Pir pass, 8¬†km into Pakistan administered Kashmir by 28 August.

=== Chhamb offensive ===

On 1 September 1965, Pakistan launched a counterattack, called Operation Grand Slam, with the objective to capture the vital town of Akhnoor in Jammu, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes to Indian troops. Ayub Khan calculated that &quot;Hindu morale would not stand more than a couple of hard blows at the right time and place&quot; although by this time Operation Gibraltar had failed and India had captured the Haji Pir Pass.

Commander of the Western army, Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh had suggested after the capture of Haji Pir, that Pakistani forces would carry out a major offensive in the Chumb plain to advance and capture a strategically important location in Akhnoor to cut Indian supply lines but after a meeting with CAOS Chaudhari, the area was not reinforced. Instead, XV Corps under Lt Gen Katoch was tasked with securing Nowshera.

At 03:30 on 1 September 1965, the entire Chumb area came under massive artillery bombardment as Pakistan commenced Operation Grand Slam. India&#x27;s Army Headquarters was taken by surprise. Attacking with an overwhelming ratio of troops and technically superior tanks, Pakistan made gains against Indian forces under the command of Maj Gen A. H. Malik, who were caught unprepared and suffered heavy losses. Maj Gen Mailk was then replaced by Maj Gen Yahya Khan by C-in-C Gen Muhammad Musa who authorised Maj Gen Khan to advance deeper into Indian Territory.

India responded by calling in its air force to blunt the Pakistani attack. The next day, Pakistan retaliated with its air force and attacked Indian forces and air bases in both Kashmir and Punjab. India then decided to open up the theatre of attack into Pakistani Punjab and forced the Pakistani army to relocate troops engaged in the Chumb operation to defend Punjab. Operation Grand Slam therefore failed, as the Pakistan Army was unable to capture Akhnoor; it became one of the turning points in the war, when India decided to relieve pressure on its troops in Kashmir by attacking Pakistan further south. In the valley, another area of strategic importance was Kargil. Kargil town was in Indian hands, but Pakistan occupied high ground overlooking Kargil and Srinagar-Leh road. However, after the launch of a massive anti-infiltration operation by the Indian army, the Pakistani infiltrators were forced out of that area in the month of August.

=== Ichogil Canal ===

India crossed the International Border on the Western front on 6 September. President Ayub Khan, on the same day, declared a state of emergency through radio broadcast proclaiming that Pakistan was in a state of war with India. On 6 September, the 15th Infantry Division of the Indian Army, under World War II veteran Major General Niranjan Prasad, battled a massive counterattack by Pakistan near the west bank of the Icchogil Canal (BRB Canal), which was an &quot;in fact&quot; border of India and Pakistan. The General&#x27;s entourage itself was ambushed, and he was forced to flee his vehicle.

==== Battle of Burki ====

The 7th Infantry Division under the command of Maj Gen Har Kishan Sibal attempted an offensive on canal on 6 September. The forces advanced through Khalra-Barki- Lahore road and reached Barki by 7 September. The forces engaged heavily at the Battle of Burki. The battle involved the air forces, armoured, infantry divisions and artillery brigades from both sides. The town fell by 11 September. A great amount of Pakistani ammunition was captured from Barki which helped Indian forces after the battle. The Indian artillery stood within the range of Lahore International Airport. As a result, the United States requested a temporary ceasefire to allow it to evacuate its citizens in Lahore.

==== Battle of Dograi ====
The thrust against Lahore consisted of the 1st Infantry Division supported by the three tank regiments of the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade; they quickly advanced across the border, reaching the Ichhogil (BRB) Canal by 6 September. The Pakistani Army held the bridges over the canal or blew up those it could not hold, effectively stalling any further advance by the Indians on Lahore. 3rd Jat battalion was the first Indian unit to cross the Icchogil canal and capture it alongside Dograi. The same day, a counteroffensive consisting of an armoured division and infantry division supported by Pakistan Air Force Sabres forced the Indian 15th Division to withdraw to its starting point. Although 3 Jats suffered minimal casualties, the bulk of the damage being taken by ammunition and store vehicles, the higher commanders had no information of 3 Jats&#x27; capture of Dograi and misleading information led to the command to withdraw from Batapore and Dograi to Ghosal-Dial. This move brought extreme disappointment to Lt-Col Desmond Hayde, CO of the 3 Jats. Dograi was eventually recaptured by the three Jats on 21 September, for the second time but after a much harder battle due to Pakistani reinforcements, in the Battle of Dograi.

On 8 September 1965, a company of five Maratha Light Infantry was sent to reinforce a Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) post at Munabao¬†‚Äì a strategic hamlet about 250 kilometers from Jodhpur. Their brief was simple. To hold the post and to keep Pakistan&#x27;s infantry battalions from overrunning the post at bay. But at Maratha Hill (in Munabao) ‚Äì as the post has now been christened¬†‚Äì the Indian company could barely manage to thwart the intense attack for 24 hours. A company of three Guards with 954 heavy mortar battery ordered to reinforce the RAC post at Munabao could never reach. The Pakistani Air Force had strafed the entire area, and also hit a railway train coming from Barmer with reinforcements near Gadra road railway station. On 10 September, Munabao fell into Pakistani hands, and efforts to capture the strategic point did not succeed.

=== Sialkot offensive ===

==== Battle of Phillora ====
On the days following 9 September, India&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division under Major General Rajinder Singh advanced towards Sialkot with the intention to capture the sector and was met with Pakistan&#x27;s 6th Armoured Division under Maj Gen Abrar Hussain. They first engaged in the town of Phillora. Failure on the Pakistani side to cause damage to the Indian advance forced the 6th Armoured Division to retreat to the town of Chawinda on 11 September and the Battle of Phillora was an Indian success. Pakistan lost 66 tanks in the battle while India only lost 6.

==== Battle of Chawinda ====
The Pakistani I Corps under the command of Lt Gen Bakhtiar Rana and the 6th Armoured under Maj Gen Hussain engaged with the Indian I Corps commanded by the newly appointed Lieutenant General Patrick Dunn and the 1st Armoured under Rajinder Singh from 14 to 19 September in the largest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk during the World War II. It also involved the lowest ever air battle to be fought as the Pakistani Sabre engaged with the Indian Gnats. The Indian offensive was repulsed and stopped successfully. Pakistan claimed that Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda. compared to 44 of its own But later, Indian official sources confirmed India lost only 29 tanks at Chawinda.

Towards the end of the Sialkot offensive, the Pakistani Armoured arsenal was left heavily damaged with more than 200 tanks destroyed and 36 captured which was very heavy compared to the Indian damages.

=== Battle of Asal Uttar ===
On 8 September, the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division and 11 Infantry Division under the command of Maj Gen Nasir Khan pushed an offensive towards Khem Karan, with the intent to capture Amritsar (a major city in Punjab, India) and the bridge on River Beas to Jalandhar. India then launched a counter-offensive. After India breached the Madhupur canal on 11 September, the Khem Karan counter-offensive was halted, affecting Pakistan&#x27;s strategy substantially. The Pakistani forces engaged with an outnumbered Indian force comprising only the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade commanded by Brig Thomas K. Theogaraj, who formed a defensive horseshoe formation to counter the advancing Pakistani force.

The Pakistani tanks were more numerous and superior in quality, giving them a significant advantage. At the Battle of Asal Uttar, however, the Pakistani force advanced into the well-positioned and well-camouflaged Indian formation, which led to approximately 97 Pakistani tanks being destroyed, against only 32 Indian tanks lost. The battle was a tremendous success for India and completely halted the Pakistani advance on the Punjab front. The town where the battle was fought came to be known as Patton Nagar, named after the thoroughly destroyed US-made M48 Patton tanks in the battle.

During the battle, Pakistani rail bound reinforcements were attacked and destroyed by IAF Gnats.

The hostilities in the Rajasthan Front commenced on 8 September. Initially, the Pakistan Desert Force and the Hur militia (followers of Pir Pagaro) were placed in a defensive role, a role for which they were well suited as it turned out. The Hurs were familiar with the terrain and the local area and possessed many essential desert survival skills which their opponents and their comrades in the Pakistan Army did not. Fighting as mainly light infantry, the Hur inflicted many casualties on the Indian forces as they entered Sindh. The Hurs were also employed as skirmishers, harassing the Indians in the Line of Control, a task they often undertook on camels. As the battle wore on, the Hurs and the Desert Force were increasingly used to attack and capture Indian villages inside Rajasthan.

=== Stalemate ===
The war was heading for a stalemate, with both nations holding territory of the other. The Indian army suffered 3,000 battlefield deaths, while Pakistan suffered 3,800. The Indian army was in possession of of Pakistani territory and the Pakistan army held of Indian territory. The territory occupied by India was mainly in the fertile Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir sectors, while Pakistani ground gains were primarily in deserts opposite Sindh and in the Chumb sector near Kashmir. Pakistan claims that it held of Indian territory, while losing of its territory.

=== Aerial warfare ===


The war saw the aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) engaging in combat for the first time since independence. Although the two forces had previously faced off in the First Kashmir War during the late 1940s, that engagement was very limited in scale compared to the 1965 conflict.

The IAF was flying large numbers of Hawker Hunters, Indian-manufactured Folland Gnats, de Havilland Vampires, EE Canberra bombers and a squadron of MiG-21s. The PAF&#x27;s fighter force comprised 102 F-86F Sabres and 12 F-104 Starfighters, along with 24 B-57 Canberra bombers. During the conflict, the PAF claimed it was out-numbered by around 5:1.

The PAF&#x27;s aircraft were largely of American origin, whereas the IAF flew an assortment of British and Soviet airplanes. However, the PAF&#x27;s American aircraft were superior to those of the IAF&#x27;s.

The F-86 Sabre was vulnerable to the diminutive Folland Gnat, nicknamed &quot;Sabre Slayer&quot;. The Gnat is credited by many independent and Indian sources as having shot down seven Pakistani Canadair Sabres in the 1965 war. while two Gnats were downed by PAF fighters. The PAF&#x27;s F-104 Starfighter was the fastest fighter operating in the subcontinent at that time and was often referred to as &quot;the pride of the PAF&quot;. However, according to Air Commodore Sajad Haider, the F-104 did not deserve this reputation. Being &quot;a high-level interceptor designed to neutralise Soviet strategic bombers at altitudes above 40,000 feet (12.19 km),&quot; rather than engage in dogfights with agile fighters at low altitudes, it was &quot;unsuited to the tactical environment of the region&quot;. In combat the Starfighter was not as effective as the IAF&#x27;s far more agile, albeit much slower, Folland Gnat fighter. Yet it zoomed into an ongoing dogfight between Sabres and Gnats, at supersonic speed, successfully broke off the fight and caused the Gnats to egress.

An IAF Gnat, piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, landed at an abandoned Pakistani airstrip at Pasrur, as he lacked the fuel to return to his base, and was captured by the Pakistan Army. According to the pilot, he got separated from his formation due to a malfunctioning compass and radio. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, presumed that Gnat was no &quot;Sabre Slayer&quot; when it came to dog fighting. Three Indian civilian aircraft were shot down by PAF, one of which shot down at Bhuj, Gujarat was carrying Balwantrai Mehta, chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, total eight killed in the incident along with Balwantrai Mehta and his wife. The Pakistan Air Force had fought well in countering the much larger Indian Air Force and supported the ground forces.

The two countries have made contradictory claims of combat losses during the war, and few neutral sources have verified the claims of either country. The PAF claimed it shot down 104 IAF planes and lost 19 of its own, while the IAF claimed it shot down 73 PAF planes and lost 59. According to PAF, It flew 86 F-86 Sabres, 10 F-104 Star fighters and 20 B-57 Canberra&#x27;s in a parade soon after the war was over. Thus disproving the IAF&#x27;s claim of downing 73 PAF fighters, which at the time constituted nearly the entire Pakistani front-line fighter force.
Indian sources have pointed out that, despite PAF claims of losing only a squadron of combat craft, Pakistan sought to acquire additional aircraft from Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and China within 10 days of the beginning of the war.

The two air forces were rather equal in the conflict because much of the Indian air force remained farther east to guard against the possibility of China entering the war.
According to independent sources, the PAF lost 20 aircraft while the Indians lost 60‚Äì75. Pakistan ended the war having depleted 17 percent of its front-line strength, while India&#x27;s losses amounted to less than 10 percent. The loss rate had begun to even out, and it has been estimated that another three weeks&#x27; fighting would have seen the Pakistani losses rising to 33 percent and India&#x27;s losses totalling 15 percent. Air superiority was not achieved, and they were unable to prevent IAF fighter bombers and reconnaissance Canberras from flying daylight missions over Pakistan. Thus, 1965 was a stalemate in terms of the air war with neither side able to achieve complete air superiority. After the war, India&#x27;s Chief of Air Staff Marshal Arjan Singh claimed that the IAF was able to achieve air superiority within three days of the Pakistani air strikes. However, according to Kenneth Werrell, the Pakistan Air Force &quot;did well in the conflict and probably had the edge&quot;. When hostilities broke out, the Pakistan Air Force with around 100 F-86s faced an enemy with five times as many combat aircraft; the Indians were also equipped with comparatively modern aircraft inventory. Despite this, Werrell credits the PAF as having the advantage of a &quot;decade&#x27;s experience with the Sabre&quot; and experienced pilots. One Pakistani fighter pilot, MM Alam, was credited with the record of downing five Indian aircraft in less than a minute, becoming the first known flying ace since the Korean War. His claims were never confirmed by the PAF and are disputed by Indian sources and some PAF officials.

=== Usage of tanks in battle ===

The 1965 war witnessed some of the largest tank battles since World War II. At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, and better equipment overall. Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90¬†mm guns. The bulk of India&#x27;s tank fleet was older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high-velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 L/40 gun. Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 20pdr (84¬†mm) gun Royal Ordnance QF 20-pounder]] gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks. Pakistan fielded a more significant number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan&#x27;s Major General T.H. Malik.

At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 50 tanks divided into three squadrons. In addition, there were 4 additional regiments termed &quot;tank delivery units&quot; (TDUs), i.e. 30, 31, 32 and 33 TDU &quot;(presumably to deceive the Indian military planners as to their actual tank strength)&quot;, each consisting of two tank squadrons and one M-36B Jackson tank destroyer squadron. Besides the Patton, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76¬†mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers. Most of these regiments served in Pakistan&#x27;s two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions¬†‚Äì the latter being in the process of formation.The Indian Army of the time possessed 15 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernising them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions. The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and some M3A3 Stuart light tanks. India had only a single armoured division, the 1st &#x27;Black Elephant&#x27; Armoured Division, which consisted of the 17th Horse (The Poona Horse), also called &#x27;Fakhr-i-Hind&#x27; (&#x27;Pride of India&#x27;), the 4th Horse (Hodson&#x27;s Horse), the 16th Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions. There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions.

Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the Lahore-Sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan&#x27;s counteroffensive on Amritsar; they were sometimes employed faultily, such as charging prepared defences during the defeat of Pakistan&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar.Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar (Battle of Asal Uttar) or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda. In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role, such as India&#x27;s 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and Pakistan&#x27;s 25th Cavalry at Chawinda.
The Centurion battle tank, with its 20pdr gun and heavy armour, performed better than the overly complex Patton.

=== Naval hostilities ===

Naval operations did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965. On 7 September, a flotilla of the Pakistan Navy commanded by Commodore S.M. Anwar, carried out a bombardment of the Indian Navy&#x27;s radar station coastal town of Dwarka, which was south of the Pakistani port of Karachi. Operation Dwarka, as it is known, is a significant naval operation of the 1965 war contested as a nuisance raid by some. The attack on Dwarka led to questions being asked in India&#x27;s parliament and subsequent post-war modernisation and expansion of the Indian Navy, with an increase in budget from Rs. 35 crores to Rs. 115 crores. Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict.

=== Covert operations ===
The Pakistan Army launched numerous covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases. On 7 September 1965, the Special Services Group (SSG) commandos were parachuted into enemy territory. According to Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army General Muhammad Musa, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields (Halwara, Pathankot and Adampur). The daring attempt turned out to be an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;. Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner (including one of the Commanders of the operations, Major Khalid Butt), and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police, or civilians. The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation.

Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations. As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles.

India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumours spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumours were later determined to be unfounded.

== Assessment of losses ==
India and Pakistan make widely divergent claims about the damage they inflicted on each other and the amount of damage suffered by them. The following summarises each nation&#x27;s claims.

=== Neutral assessments ===

There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war. Most of these assessments agree that India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared. Some neutral assessments are mentioned below¬†‚Äî
* According to the Library of Congress Country Studies conducted by the Federal Research Division of the United States ‚Äì
The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other. Losses were relatively heavy‚Äîon the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops. Pakistan&#x27;s army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan. Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country&#x27;s military defeat by ‚ÄúHindu India‚Äù and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government.

* Former &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Arif Jamal wrote in his book &quot;Shadow War&quot;¬†‚Äî

This time, India&#x27;s victory was nearly total: India accepted a cease-fire only after it had occupied , though Pakistan had made marginal gains of of territory. Despite the obvious strength of the Indian win, both countries claim to have been victorious.
* Devin T. Hagerty wrote in his book &quot;South Asia in world politics&quot;¬†‚Äì
The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan&#x27;s second-largest city. By the time the United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat.

* In his book &quot;National identity and geopolitical visions&quot;, Gertjan Dijkink writes¬†‚Äì
The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts.

* An excerpt from Stanley Wolpert&#x27;s &quot;India&quot;, summarising the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965,
In three weeks, the second Indo-Pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U.S. ammunition and replacements for both armies forced the cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory. India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan&#x27;s capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir&#x27;s strategic Uri-Poonch bulge, much to Ayub&#x27;s chagrin.

* In his book titled &quot;The greater game: India&#x27;s race with destiny and China&quot;, David Van Praagh wrote¬†‚Äì
India won the war. It held on to the Vale of Kashmir, the prize Pakistan vainly sought. It gained of Pakistani territory: in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan&#x27;s portion of the state; of the Sailkot sector; far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, on the Lahore front. Pakistan took of Indian territory: in the Chhamb sector and around Khem Karan.

* Dennis Kux&#x27;s &quot;India and the United States estranged democracies&quot; also provides a summary of the war,
Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the best of the war. New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan&#x27;s attempt to seize Kashmir by force. Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated.
* &quot;A region in turmoil: South Asian conflicts since 1947&quot; by Robert Johnson mentions¬†‚Äì
India&#x27;s strategic aims were modest¬†‚Äì it aimed to deny the Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of of Pakistani territory for the loss of just of its own.

* An excerpt from William M. Carpenter and David G. Wiencek&#x27;s &quot;Asian security handbook: terrorism and the new security environment&quot;¬†‚Äì
A brief, but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by the Indian Army. Another UN-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan&#x27;s vulnerability had again been exposed.

* English historian John Keay&#x27;s &quot;India: A History&quot; provides a summary of the 1965 war¬†‚Äì
The 1965 Indo-Pak war lasted barely a month. Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert, but its main push against India&#x27;s Jammu-Srinagar road link was repulsed, and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore. Both sides claimed victory, but India had most to celebrate.

* Uk Heo and Shale Asher Horowitz write in their book &quot;Conflict in Asia: Korea, China-Taiwan, and India-Pakistan&quot;¬†‚Äì
Again, India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position, but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory.
* According to the Office of the Historian within the U.S. Department of State:
Conflict resumed again in early 1965, when Pakistani and Indian forces clashed over disputed territory along the border between the two nations. Hostilities intensified that August when the Pakistani army attempted to take Kashmir by force. The attempt to seize the state was unsuccessful, and the second India-Pakistan War reached a stalemate.
*Anthony Tucker-Jones write in his book Tank Battles of the Cold War, 1948-1991:
Both sides fought each other to a stalemate. Shortly after they agreed to a cease-fire, with each side having lost about 200 tanks. 

== Ceasefire ==
On 20 September, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution, which noted that its previous two resolutions went &quot;unheeded&quot; and now &quot;demanded&quot; an unconditional ceasefire from both nations within 48 hours.
India immediately accepted, while Pakistan accepted it on 23 September, with some notable dramatics.

India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India. In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan used the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector. This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December. On 10 October, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by three SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala. A Pakistani Army Auster AOP was shot down on 16 December, killing one Pakistani army captain; on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hawker Hunters.

The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.

=== Tashkent Declaration ===
The United States and the Soviet Union used significant diplomatic tools to prevent any further escalation in the conflict between the two South Asian nations. The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexei Kosygin, hosted peace negotiations in Tashkent (now in Uzbekistan), where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Muhammad Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Declaration on 10 January 1966, agreeing to withdraw to pre-August lines no later than 25 February 1966. In India, the agreement was criticised because it did not contain a no-war pact or any renunciation of guerrilla warfare across Kashmir.

India&#x27;s Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the Tashkent Agreement on 11 January 1966. As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the peace declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress.

=== Public perceptions ===
The ceasefire was criticised by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains. The protests led to student riots. Pakistan State&#x27;s reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war¬†‚Äì which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India¬†‚Äì and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains. Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-ISI chief Lieutenant General Mahmud Ahmed Durrani initially titled &quot;The Myth of 1965 Victory&quot;, reportedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by the Pakistan Army to prevent circulation because the topic was &quot;too sensitive&quot;. The book was published with the revised title &quot;History of Indo Pak War 1965&quot;, published by Services Book Club, a part of the Pakistan military and printed by Oxford University Press, Karachi. A few copies of the book have survived. A version was published in India as &quot;Illusion of Victory: A Military History of the Indo-Pak War-1965&quot; by Lexicon Publishers. Recently a new Pakistani impression has been published in 2017.

== Intelligence failures ==
Strategic miscalculations by both India and Pakistan ensured that the war ended in a stalemate. In part, this inspired Shekhar Gupta to coin the protologism, &quot;war of mutual incompetence&quot;.

=== Indian miscalculations ===
Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion. The Indian Army failed to recognise the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result.

The &quot;Official War History ‚Äì 1965&quot;, drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long-suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations. According to the document, on 22 September when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen. Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire. The general replied that most of India&#x27;s frontline ammunition had been used up, and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses. It was determined later that only 14% of India&#x27;s frontline ammunition had been fired, and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan. By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition.

Air Chief Marshal (retd.) P.C. Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army. Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other. The battle plans, drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle. This attitude of Gen. Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the &quot;Supremo Syndrome&quot;, a patronising attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military.

=== Pakistani miscalculations ===
The Pakistani Army&#x27;s failures began with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive victory. The Kashmiri people, on the other hand, remained calm and collected. The Indian Army was given enough information to understand Operation Gibraltar and that they were battling not insurgents, as they had initially thought, but Pakistani Army regulars.

The Pakistani Army didn&#x27;t know that Indian leaders wanted to attack the southern part of the country to start a new war. Pakistan had to send troops to the southern part of the country to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead of using them to help get to Kashmir.

Pakistan&#x27;s attempt to capture Ahnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was a failure. Many Pakistani commentators said that the Ayub Khan administration was indecisive during &quot;Operation Grand Slam&quot;. The critics contend that the mission was unsuccessful due to Ayub Khan&#x27;s awareness of the significance of Akhnoor to India, referring to it as India&#x27;s &#x27;jugular vein&#x27;, and his reluctance to invade it and initiate a conflict. Although progress was made in Akhnoor, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding officer, Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik, and replaced him with General Yahya Khan. During the replacement, a 24-hour pause was observed, enabling the Indian army to regroup in Akhnoor and successfully repel a sluggish assault led by General Yahya Khan. The Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command said, &quot;The enemy came to our rescue.&quot; Then, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticised Ayub Khan for inventing Operation Gibraltar, which ultimately failed, and for denying him command at a crucial point in the conflict. Malik said he would tell the truth about the war and how the army failed, but later decided not to because he was afraid of being banned.

Some authors have said that a war game¬†‚Äì that was held in March 1965 at the Institute for Defense Analyses in the United States might have encouraged Pakistan. The exercise concluded that Pakistan would prevail in the event of a conflict with India. Other authors like Stephen P. Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had &quot;acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military¬†‚Ä¶ the 1965 war was a shock.&quot;

During the war, the Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of PAF, Nur Khan, later stated that it is the Pakistan Army that should be held accountable for initiating the conflict, rather than India. However, propaganda about the war continued in Pakistan, with most of the blame being placed on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures. This pattern persisted until the disastrous outcome of the Indo-Pakistani war in 1971.

== Involvement of other nations ==
The United States and the United Kingdom have been the principal suppliers of military mat√©riel to India and Pakistan since 1947. Both India and Pakistan were Commonwealth republics. While India had pursued a policy of nominal non-alignment, Pakistan was a member of both CENTO and SEATO and an ally of the West in its struggle against communism. Well before the conflict began, however, Britain and the United States had suspected Pakistan of joining both alliances out of opportunism to acquire advanced weapons for a war against India. They had therefore limited their military aid to Pakistan to maintain the existing balance of power in the subcontinent. In 1959, however, Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation under which the United States agreed to take &quot;appropriate action, including the use of armed forces&quot; to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request. By 1965, American and British analysts had recognised the two international groupings, CENTO and SEATO, and Pakistan&#x27;s continued alliance with the West as being largely meaningless.

Following the start of the 1965 war, both the United States and Britain took the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan&#x27;s fault, and suspended all arms shipments to both India and Pakistan. While the United States maintained a neutral stance, the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, condemned India for aggression after its army advanced towards Lahore; his statement was met with a furious rebuttal from India.

Internationally, the level of support which Pakistan received was limited at best. Iran and Turkey issued a joint communiqu√© on 10 September which placed the blame on India, backed the United Nations&#x27; appeal for a cease-fire and offered to deploy troops for a UN peacekeeping mission in Kashmir. Pakistan received support from Indonesia, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia in the form of six naval vessels, jet fuel, guns, and ammunition and financial support, respectively. Pakistan didn&#x27;t gain meaningful support at an international level.

Since before the war, the People&#x27;s Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and a military opponent of India, with whom it had fought a brief war in 1962. China had also become a foreign patron for Pakistan and had given Pakistan $60 million in development assistance in 1965. During the war, China openly supported the Pakistani position. It took advantage of the conflict to issue a strongly worded ultimatum to India condemning its &quot;aggression&quot; in Tibet and hinting at nuclear retaliation by China (China had exploded its first nuclear device the previous year). Despite strong fears of Chinese intervention on the side of Pakistan, the Chinese government ultimately exercised restraint. This was partly due to the logistical difficulties of a direct Chinese military intervention against India and India&#x27;s improved military strength after its defeat by China in 1962. China had also received strong warnings by the American and Soviet governments against expanding the scope of the conflict by intervening. In the face of this pressure, China backed down, extending the deadline for India to respond to its ultimatum and warning India against attacking East Pakistan. Ultimately, Pakistan rejected Chinese offers of military aid, recognising that accepting it would only result in further alienating Pakistan internationally. International opinion considered China&#x27;s actions to be dangerously reckless and aggressive, and it was soundly rebuked in the world press for its unnecessarily provocative stance during the conflict.

India&#x27;s participation in the Non-Aligned Movement yielded little support from its members. Support given by Indonesia to Pakistan was seen as a major Indian diplomatic failure, as Indonesia had been among the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement along with India. Despite its close relations with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than other nations during the war, inviting both nations to peace talks under its aegis in Tashkent.

== Aftermath ==

=== India ===

Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived by many as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir. In its October 1, 1965 issue, &quot;Time&quot; magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war: &quot;Now it&#x27;s apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right.&quot;¬†

In light of the failures of the Sino-Indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a &quot;politico-strategic&quot; victory for India. The Indian prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India.

While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticised for their failure to effectively deploy India&#x27;s superior armed forces to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan. In his book &quot;War in the modern world since 1815&quot;, noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan &quot;lost heavily&quot; during the 1965 war, India&#x27;s hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces. He elaborates:

India&#x27;s chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out of ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted. In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks.¬†
In 2015, Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh, the last surviving armed force commander of the conflict, gave his assessment that the war ended in a stalemate, but only due to international pressure for a ceasefire, and that India would have achieved a decisive victory had hostilities continued for a few days more:

For political reasons, Pakistan claims victory in the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended in a kind of stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree to a ceasefire. But I think he was pressured by the United Nations and some countries.
As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the tri-services of the Indian Armed Forces. Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence. Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks.

China&#x27;s repeated threats to intervene in the conflict supporting Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons. Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict, thus irking India. At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India. These developments led to a significant change in India&#x27;s foreign policy¬†‚Äì India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union. By the end of the 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India&#x27;s arms imports were from the Soviet Union. After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far. India&#x27;s defence budget too would increase gradually after the war. In 1966‚Äì1967, it would rise to 17% and by 1970‚Äì1971 it would rise to 25% of its revenue. According to World Bank data, India&#x27;s defence expenditure by GDP decreased from 3.871% in 1965 to 3.141% in 1969, then slightly increased to 3.652% in 1971.

=== Pakistan ===
After the war, a significant number of Pakistanis regarded their military performance to be positive. In Pakistan, 6 September is celebrated as Defence Day to remember how Lahore was able to defend itself against the Indian army. The performance of the Pakistani Air Force was particularly praised.

The Pakistani government was accused of spreading misinformation about the consequences of the war among its citizens. In his book &quot;Mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies&quot;, S.M. Burke writes¬†‚Äî

After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India. Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength.

Air Marshal (retired) Nur Khan, who headed the Pakistan Air Force in 1965, said in an interview with Dawn newspaper ‚Äî

The army ‚Äúmisled the nation with a big lie‚Äù ‚Äì that India rather than Pakistan provoked the war ‚Äì and that Pakistan won a ‚Äúgreat victory‚Äù.

And since the ‚Äúlie‚Äù was never rectified, the Pakistani ‚Äúarmy came to believe its fiction, (and) has continued to fight unwanted wars,‚Äù

Pakistani commentator Haidar Imtiaz remarked:

The myth of ‚Äòvictory‚Äô was created after the war had ended, to counter Indian claims of victory on the one hand and to shield the Ayub regime and the army from criticism on the other.

A book titled &quot;Indo-Pakistan War of 1965: A Flashback&quot;, produced by the Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan, is used as the official history of the war, which omits any mention of the operations Gibraltar and Grand Slam, and begins with the Indian counter-offensive on the Lahore front. The Pakistan Army is claimed to have put up a &quot;valiant defense of the motherland&quot; and forced the attack in its tracks.

Most people agree that the idea of a mobile, hard-hitting Pakistan Army was badly hurt during the war because important breakthroughs were not made. 
The military&#x27;s ill-founded belief that their &quot;martial race&quot; of soldiers could defeat &quot;Hindu India&quot; in the conflict was criticised by several Pakistani writers. Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote¬†‚Äì
The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in an intense violent military campaign fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long.
Historian Akbar S Zaidi notes that Pakistan &quot;lost terribly in the 1965 war&quot;.

The Pakistani air force, on the other hand, racked up considerable acclaim and esteem among the military and international warfare critics for its defence of Lahore and other crucial parts of the country and its hefty retaliation against India the day afterward. The air force&#x27;s vigilance was also influenced by the fact that some pilots were frantically re-enlisted six times in a single hour when they detected Indian air raids. In Pakistan, the air force and army are honored on Defence Day and Air Force Day. These days are on 6 and 7 September, respectively.

Furthermore, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the conflict, and, perhaps even more crucial, it had failed to secure Kashmir. Many people consider this outcome to be a setback for Pakistan.

The faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar was criticised by senior Pakistani officials and military experts, which ultimately led to the conflict. The Tashkent declaration was also criticised in Pakistan, even though few people were aware of the seriousness of the situation at the end of the conflict. Political leaders were also subjected to criticism. Ayub Khan had espoused high expectations among the Pakistani populace regarding the superiority,¬† if not invincibility,¬† of its armed forces, in accordance with the guidance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the foreign minister of Pakistan. Nonetheless, the failure of Pakistan to attain its military objectives during the conflict resulted in a political liability for Ayub. After the defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions, an increasingly vocal opposition challenged the army&#x27;s invincibility.

The economic contraction in Pakistan was one of the most significant outcomes of the conflict. Pakistan had experienced impressive economic growth since the early 1960s, but the war ended that. Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan&#x27;s defence spending rose from 4.82% to 9.86% of GDP, putting a tremendous strain on its economy. In 1970‚Äì71, the expenditure on defence accounted for 32% or 55.66% of the total government expenditure. According to veterans of the war, the war greatly cost Pakistan economically, politically, and militarily. Nuclear theorist Feroze Khan maintained that the 1965 war was a last conventional attempt to snatch Kashmir by military force, and Pakistan&#x27;s own position in the international community, especially with the United States, began to deteriorate from the point the war started, while on the other hand, the alliance with China saw improvements. Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid claims in his memoirs that Zhou Enlai had long advised the government in the classic style of Sun Tzu: &quot;to go slow, not to push India hard, and avoid a fight over Kashmir, &#x27;for at least, 20‚Äì30 years, until you have developed your economy and consolidated your national power&#x27;.&quot; General Majid maintained in &quot;Eating Grass&quot; that the &quot;sane, philosophical and political critical thinking&quot; was missing in Pakistan, and that the country had lost extensive human resources by fighting the war.

Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support from the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation. The US turned neutral in the war when it cut off military supplies to Pakistan (and India); an action that the Pakistanis took as a sign of betrayal. After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support.

Another negative consequence of the war was growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), particularly for West Pakistan&#x27;s obsession with Kashmir. Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir. In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrengthed infantry division (14th Division), sixteen planes and no tanks. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, an action that ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971.

Pakistan celebrates Defence Day every year to commemorate 6 September 1965 to pay tribute to the soldiers killed in the war. However, Pakistani journalists, including Taha Siddiqui and Haseeb Asif have criticised the celebration of Defence Day.

<doc id="612236" wikidata="Q2670921" url="?curid=612236" title="Kaguya (mouse)">
<text>Kaguya was the first bimaternal mouse created in laboratory using two eggs from female parents by Tomohiro Kono and colleagues at Tokyo University of Agriculture. This was a hallmark experiment as natural fertilization in mice requires the contribution of an egg from the female parent and a sperm from the male parent. The first bimaternal mouse was named after a Japanese folk tale, in which the Moon-born princess Kaguya (Kaguya-hime) is found as a baby inside a bamboo stalk.

== Parthenogenesis in Mammals ==
Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction that refers to development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell by the female parent. Although this happens naturally in many taxa, such as plants, some invertebrates, and vertebrates, it has not been recorded in any mammals. Rapid advances in molecular biology and genomics have made it possible for successful artificial development of a mouse embryo solely from unfertilized eggs.

Epigenetics refers to proteins and enzymes that sit above the DNA sequence and influence its activity. Parent-specific epigenetic changes, known as genomic imprinting, are required for successful fertilization and embryonic development in mammals. These modifications fine-tune the expression of key genes in development.

== Bimaternal Mice ==
To overcome the genomic barriers arising due to parent-specific gene activity that prevent successful development of embryos only from egg cells in mammals, Kono and colleagues genetically modified eggs from newborn female mice to make them similar to a sperm cell. Egg cells undergo DNA methylation, which is an epigenetic change associated with silencing of gene activity, during their development. Eggs from newborn mice are not methylated yet, thus making their epigenetic modifications more similar to sperm cells. They altered the expression of &quot;Igf2&quot; and &quot;H19&quot; genes by deleting a region of &quot;H19&quot; in the newborn egg. These two genes are key regulators of mammalian embryonic development and have different levels of activity in the sperm and egg cell due to genomic imprinting. The deleted region between the two contains a methylated region that regulates their activity. They then moved the nucleus of the modified newborn egg into a mature egg for artificial fertilization.

Of the 598 eggs used in the experiment, only two embryos successfully developed into viable offspring. One of them was used to look at gene activity in bimaternal mice. The other was named Kaguya. Kaguya was raised to the adult stage and was able to produce offspring through mating with a male mouse.

===Differences in Comparison to Normal Mice===

Many of the mice pups recovered in this experiment had atypical development and died prematurely and some eggs failed to successfully impregnate female mice; only two pups survived. Mice with atypical development exhibited developmentally delayed livers. Bimaternal mice had significantly lower body and placental weight compared to the controls.

A mouse microarray, a tool used to study the activity of many genes at once, with 11‚Äô000 genes was used to compare the gene expression of the developmentally typical bimaternal mouse embryo to mice born from natural mating. This was done to see if there are any differences between the two groups at molecular level. More than 1‚Äô000 genes were found to have different levels of activity in the bimaternal mouse compared to the controls. It was revealed that these genes are mostly associated with cell communication, cell growth/maintenance, and metabolism. However, the small sample size per group, reliance on older technology, and single time point analysis may limit the informativeness of this genetic analysis.

==Follow Up Study==

In a follow up paper, Kono lab was able to increase the number of bimaternal mice generated by modifying the genetic manipulations performed on the newborn eggs used in the experiment. Interestingly, bimaternal pups similar to controls were shown to grow at a slower rate and have a longer lifespan.

<doc id="612238" wikidata="Q5784194" url="?curid=612238" title="Tree house">
<text>A tree house, tree fort or treeshed, is a platform or building constructed around, next to or among the trunk or branches of one or more mature trees while above ground level. Tree houses can be used for recreation, work space, habitation, a hangout space and observation. People occasionally connect ladders or staircases to get up to the platforms.

==History==
===Prehistoric hypotheses===
All great apes build tree platforms or nests as shelter from dangers on the ground, and the habit may have been inherited by humans. While no evidence of prehistoric human-made tree houses has been found, wooden structures would not have survived over time. In contrast, evidence of cave dwellings, rock shelters, and bonfires is detectable, but is notably scarce from before 40,000 years ago. This has led to the speculative hypothesis that archaic humans may have lived in trees until then. The skeletal changes due to the evolution of human bipedalism started at least four million years ago, but early bipedal hominins may still have spent some time in trees and retained some tree-climbing abilities. Early terrestrial bipedalism is supported by evidence such as fossilized bones and footprints (like the Laetoli footprints). According to the savannah hypothesis, this evolution happened as an effect of early humans adapting to life on the ground in savannah environments, partly for more energy-efficient locomotion.

=== Among indigenous people ===
Even today, tree houses are built by some indigenous people in order to escape the danger and adversity on the ground in some parts of the tropics. It has been claimed that the majority of the Korowai clans, a Papuan tribe in the southeast of Irian Jaya, live in tree houses on their isolated territory as protection against a tribe of neighbouring head-hunters, the Citak. The BBC revealed in 2018 that the Korowai had constructed some very high tree houses &quot;for the benefit of overseas programme makers&quot; and did not actually live in them. However, the Korowai people still build tree houses, not elevated but fastened to the trunks of tall trees, to protect occupants and store food away from scavenging animals.

===In modern societies===

Trees have historically been integrated into the construction of buildings, for example the walls of a chapel, to provide support to a structure built around them. is an example of this practice. Modern tree houses are usually built as play areas for children or for leisure purposes, but may also be used as accommodation in hotels or residential applications. In this case, the main part of the structure is built with more typical construction materials. The use of tree houses in this manner is part of a movement towards the practice of &quot;living architecture&quot;.

Tree houses may be considered as an option for building eco-friendly houses in forested areas, because unlike more typical forms of housing, they do not require the clearing of trees.

==Support methods and technology==

There are numerous techniques to fasten the structure to the tree which seek to minimize tree damage.

The construction of modern tree houses usually starts with the creation of a rigid platform, on which the house will be placed; the platform will lean (possibly on the corners) on the branches. In case there are not enough suitable supports, the methods to support the platform are:
* Struts and stilts
Struts and stilts are used for relieving weights on a lower elevation or straight to the ground; tree houses supported by stilts weigh much less on the tree and help to prevent stress, potential strain, and injury caused by puncture holes. Stilts are typically anchored into the ground with concrete, although new designs such as the &quot;Diamond Pier&quot; speeds installation and are less invasive for the root system. Stilts are considered the easiest method of supporting larger tree houses and can also increase structural support and safety.
* Stay rods
Stay rods are used for relieving weights on a higher elevation. These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth. However, they are used less often due to the natural limits of the system. Higher elevation and more branches tailing off decreases capacity and increases wind sensitivity. Building materials for hanging include ropes, wire cables, tension fasteners, and springs.
* Friction and tension fasteners
Friction and tension fasteners are the most common noninvasive methods of securing tree houses. They do not use nails, screws or bolts, but instead grip the beams to the trunk by means of counter-beam, threaded bars, or tying.
* Invasive methods
Invasive methods are all methods that use nails, screws, bolts, kingpins, etc. Because these methods require punctures in the tree, they must be planned properly in order to minimize stress. Not all species of plants suffer from puncture in the same way, depending partly on whether the sap conduits run in the pith or in the bark. Nails are generally not recommended. A special kind of bolt developed in the 1990s called a treehouse attachment bolt can support greater weights than earlier methods.

==Popularity==

Since the mid-1990s, recreational tree houses have enjoyed a rise in popularity in countries such as the United States and parts of Europe. This has been due to increased disposable income, better technology for builders, research into safe building practices and an increased interest in environmental issues, particularly sustainable living. This growing popularity is also reflected in a rise of social media channels, websites, and television shows specially dedicated to featuring tree houses around the world.

Increased popularity has, in turn, given rise to demand for businesses covering all building and design work for clients. There are over 30 businesses in Europe and the US specializing in the construction of tree houses of various degrees of permanence and sophistication, from children&#x27;s play structures to fully functioning homes.

Popularity of tree house hotels is equally growing due to the popularity in the glamping and unique accommodation industries with a number of booking websites offering accommodation in tree houses.

==Building regulations==
Many areas of the world have no specific planning laws for tree houses, so the legal issues can be confusing to both the builder and the local planning departments. Treehouses can be exempt, partially regulated or fully regulated - depending on the locale.

In some cases, tree houses are exempted from standard building regulations, as they are considered outside of the regulations specification. An exemption may be given to a builder if the tree house is in a remote or non-urban location. Alternatively, a tree house may be included in the same category as structures such as garden sheds, sometimes called a &quot;temporary structure&quot;. There may be restrictions on height, distance from boundary and privacy for nearby properties. There are various in these laws, as they were not specifically designed for tree-borne structures. A very small number of planning departments have specific regulations for tree houses, which set out clearly what may be built and where. For safety during the tree house construction, it is usually best to do as much work as possible on the ground, taking long-term viability into consideration.

==Protest communities==
The tree house has been central to various environmental protest communities around the world, in a technique, popularized, known as tree sitting. This method may be used in protests against proposed road building or old-growth forestry operations. Tree houses are used as a method of defence from which it is difficult and costly to safely evict the protesters and begin work. Julia Butterfly Hill is a particularly well known tree sitter who occupied a Californian redwood for 738 days (from December 1997 to December 1999), saving the tree and others in the immediate area. Her accommodation consisted of two platforms above the ground.

<text>&quot;Mahan&quot;-class destroyers of the United States Navy were a series of 18 destroyers of which the first 16 were laid down in 1934. The last two of the 18, and (this pair laid down in 1935), are sometimes considered a separate ship class. All 18 were commissioned in 1936 and 1937. was the lead ship, named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, an influential historian and theorist on sea power.

The &quot;Mahan&quot;s featured improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 torpedo tubes, superimposed gun shelters, and generators for emergency use. The Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class introduced a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient than the &quot;Mahan&quot;s&#x27; predecessors‚Äîso much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.

All 18 ships saw action in World War II, entirely in the Pacific Theater, which included the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the battles of the Santa Cruz Islands, Leyte Gulf, and Iwo Jima. Their participation in major and secondary campaigns included the bombardment of beachheads, amphibious landings, task force screening, convoy and patrol duty, and anti-aircraft and submarine warfare. Six ships were lost in combat and two were expended in the postwar Operation Crossroads nuclear tests. The remainder were decommissioned, sold, or scrapped after the war; none remain today. Collectively, the ships received 111 battle stars for their World War II service.

==Design==
The &quot;Mahan&quot;-class destroyers emerged as improved versions of the ,
which incorporated the most up-to-date machinery available.
The Navy&#x27;s General Board had wrestled with the proposed design changes, first they considered 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer /38 caliber gun, and then proposed to retain all five guns with the twelve torpedo tubes, but configure those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The Chief of Naval Operations objected, and recommended against &quot;subordinating the gun to the torpedo&quot;, and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the &quot;Mahan&quot; class and others. In the final design, No. 3 gun was moved to the aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4) to make room for the third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, and released the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse. All five 5 in/38s were kept and remained dual purpose guns, able to target aircraft as well as ships, but only No. 1 and No. 2 had gun shields. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery. This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. Double reduction gearing also reduced the size of the faster-turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added. These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the &quot;Farragut&quot;s.

The &quot;Mahan&quot;s typically had a tripod foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they were similar to the larger s that immediately preceded them. The &quot;Mahan&quot;s were fitted with the first emergency generators, which replaced the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.

The &quot;Mahan&quot;s displaced at standard load and at deep load. The overall length of the class was , the beam was , and the draft . They were powered by General Electric geared steam turbines, driving two shafts that developed a total of for a maximum speed of . Four Babcock &amp; Wilcox or four Foster Wheeler water-tube boilers generated the superheated steam needed for the turbines. The &quot;Mahan&quot;s carried a maximum of of fuel oil, with a range of at . Their peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men. The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men.

===Engineering===
The &quot;Mahan&quot;s&#x27; propulsion plant was considerably improved over that of the &quot;Farragut&quot;s. The steam pressure was raised from to in some ships, and the superheated steam temperature was raised from to in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, and allowed smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used. This saved enough space and weight so that cruising turbines could be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. The boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships&#x27; range was extended to at , farther than the &quot;Farragut&quot;s. The design shaft horsepower was increased from to in the same space and weight as in the &quot;Farragut&quot;s. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the &quot;Mahan&quot;s&#x27; ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons of extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by the General Electric Company and were the impulse-type, also called the Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine, which fed into a common reduction gear and drove a shaft, in a similar manner to the machinery illustrated at the following reference note. The steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, in turn exhausted to the condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed. At low speeds, they were operated in a series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, and also improved the fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became a standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of them had cruising turbines.

===As-built armament===

The main battery of the &quot;Mahan&quot; class consisted of five dual purpose /38 caliber guns, equipped with the Mark 33 gun fire-control system. The anti-aircraft battery had four water-cooled .50 caliber machine guns (12.7¬†mm). The class was fitted with three quadruple torpedo tube mounts for twelve torpedo tubes, guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire control system. The class was initially equipped with the Mark 11 torpedo or Mark 12 torpedo, which were replaced by the Mark 15 torpedo beginning in 1938. The depth charge roll-off racks were rigged on the stern.

===Wartime modifications===
In early 1942, the &quot;Mahan&quot;-class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process to increase the ships&#x27; light anti-aircraft (AA) armament. These followed the standard pattern of other five-gun destroyer classes, removing the No. 3 5-inch/38 mount and replacing it with ideally two twin Bofors 40 mm guns (1.6¬†in): sacrificing 20% of the anti-surface gun battery was preferable to a third of the torpedo battery. Generally between four and seven 20 mm Oerlikon (0.79¬†in) mounts were installed, with the intended fit three forward of the bridge and two abreast the second funnel. Due to early shortages of Bofors mounts most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944, thus additional Oerlikons were installed in 1942-1943 in the intended Bofors positions. As weight compensation, the bridge wings were cut back, tripod foremast replaced by a pole mast, and several other elements eliminated, including the mainmast, torpedo tube blast shields, gun shelter on the after deckhouse, and the potato locker.

In January 1945, as part of the anti-Kamikaze refit program, removal of the two waist torpedo tubes was authorized, providing enough weight margin to replace the two 40¬†mm twin mounts with quads. Ultimately only &quot;Lamson&quot; was modified to this configuration. In June, removal of the third centerline tube was authorized to make way for two 40¬†mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack for a total of two quad and two twin mounts. All Oerlikons were removed except two mounts forward of the bridge, upgraded from singles to twins. Only &quot;Shaw&quot; received the twelve Bofors configuration, and when inclined after the refit she was found to be too top-heavy and had to land one of her 5-inch/38s. This largely negated the improved anti-aircraft armament and Commander Destroyers Pacific insisted she be reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have additional directors installed with their new 40¬†mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with radar, but &quot;Shaw&quot; at minimum retained four Mark 51s. 

There were some unique modifications to individual ships, but the most noteworthy are the rebuilt &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Downes&quot;. The original hulls were damaged beyond repair at Pearl Harbor and scrapped, but the machinery and main batteries were largely undamaged and installed in two new-built hulls at Mare Island. These rebuilt ships retained only two quadruple torpedo tubes (both mounted on the centerline above the main deck) and had six rather than five Oerlikons (four rather than three on the bridge), but otherwise had the same four 5-inch/38s and two twin Bofors of a typical &quot;Mahan&quot; in 1943/1944. These ships also had a new British-style bridge like those being mounted on 5-inch destroyer escorts, rebuilt 1,850 ton &quot;leaders&quot;, and the new &quot;Sumner&quot; class destroyers. These were also the only two &quot;Mahan&quot;s to mount the Mark 37 director for their 5-inch guns.

==&quot;Dunlap&quot; class==
The &quot;Dunlap&quot; class was a two-ship destroyer class based on the &quot;Mahan&quot; design, listed as a separate class in some sources. The ships were and , the last two &quot;Mahan&quot;s. Unlike the &quot;Mahan&quot;s, the &quot;Dunlap&quot;s had the new Mark 25 enclosed mounts for the two forward 5-inch/38 caliber guns, with base rings housing projectile hoists that rotated with each of the guns; their ammunition was fed from a handling room below each mount. &quot;Dunlap&quot; and &quot;Fanning&quot; were the first US destroyers to use enclosed forward gun mounts rather than shields; their light pole foremast and lack of a mainmast visibly distinguished them from the &quot;Mahan&quot;s.

==Construction==
The construction of the first sixteen vessels was authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933. The last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act of 27 March 1934 (as part of a group of 95 destroyers authorised on that date‚Äîand covered DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). The contracts for the first six &quot;Mahan&quot;s were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure. On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of Gibbs &amp; Cox was named as the design agent. The firm had no experience in the design of warships, but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy. The decision was made to design the &quot;Mahan&quot; class and future classes around a new generation of machinery. This included a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system, which combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double reduction gears.

==Ships in class==
Note &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Downes&quot; in this table have two different builders, keel laying dates, and launch dates. Both ships were severely damaged at Pearl Harbor with their hulls damaged beyond repair. Their machinery, however, was nearly intact, and this was shipped to Mare Island Naval Shipyard to be installed in two new-built hulls. The original hulls were scrapped in Pearl Harbor, but the new-built hulls retained the same names and hull numbers as the original ships.

&quot;Dunlap&quot; and &quot;Fanning&quot; are sometimes considered the &quot;Dunlap&quot; class (see above).

==Service history==

===&quot;Mahan&quot;===

USS &quot;Mahan&quot; was commissioned on the east coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937. She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor. At sea when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Mahan&quot; participated in the initial post-attack efforts in search of the strike force. The ship joined Task Force 17 in February 1942, which conducted raids on several atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Late in March, she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul. By August 1942, &quot;Mahan&quot; was back operating out of Pearl Harbor.
In October 1942, &quot;Mahan&quot; was assigned to Task Force 61 and took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. The engagement cost the Navy 74 aircraft, the aircraft carrier , and one destroyer. While en route to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, &quot;Mahan&quot; and the battleship collided, causing severe damage to both ships. Temporary repairs were made to &quot;Mahan&quot; and she steamed to Pearl Harbor for a new bow. She pulled out of Pearl Harbor in January 1943. In the months to follow, &quot;Mahan&quot; escorted convoys between New Hebrides and the Fiji Islands, performed patrol assignments off New Caledonia and engaged in operations in Australian waters. Assigned to the amphibious force of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, &quot;Mahan&quot; participated in a succession of wide-ranging amphibious campaigns in New Guinea and New Britain. In February and March 1944, she saw action with the 7th Fleet in the Admiralty Islands. After that the ship was ordered back to the west coast for an overhaul, leaving the yard in July 1944 for Pearl Harbor.

Returning to New Guinea, &quot;Mahan&quot; began to escort convoys between Hollandia, in Indonesia and Leyte, in the Philippine Islands. By November 1944, she was doing anti-submarine patrols off Leyte. On 7 December 1944 while patrolling the channel between Leyte and Ponson Island, a group of Japanese suicide aircraft overwhelmed &quot;Mahan&quot; at Ormoc Bay. She was disabled by the attack, then abandoned and sunk by a US destroyer. &quot;Mahan&quot; received five battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Cummings&quot;===
USS &quot;Cummings&quot; served in the Pacific Fleet in the late 1930s, participating in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast. &quot;Cummings&quot; went on a goodwill visit to several ports in the South Pacific, including Auckland, New Zealand, and Tahiti. The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast for the first six months of World War II. In June 1942, she was transferred to convoy escort duties in the South Pacific until August, when she had an overhaul in San Francisco, and then returned to her role as a convoy escort in the South Pacific.

In January 1944, &quot;Cummings&quot; joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Strike Force while it raided Japanese positions in the Central Pacific. In March, &quot;Cummings&quot; sailed for Trincomalee, Ceylon, where she rendezvoused with British ships for exercises. In April, the ship joined a British force to screen during air strikes on Sabang, Indonesia. She returned to Ceylon in May and then moved on to Exmouth Gulf, Australia. With a British force, &quot;Cummings&quot; sortied for air strikes on Soerabaja, Java, before leaving for Pearl Harbor.

By July she was back in San Francisco to escort the heavy cruiser , the ship that carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Cummings&quot; joined the US 3rd Fleet for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. The next month, she bombarded Iwo Jima in preparation for the amphibious assault on the island. The ship operated off Okinawa during its invasion. After the war, &quot;Cummings&quot; returned to the United States and was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1947. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Drayton&quot;===
USS &quot;Drayton&quot; made her shakedown cruise to Europe late in 1936, and finished her final trials in the United States. She left Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, to join the Scouting Force. In July, &quot;Drayton&quot; participated in the search for the lost American pilot, Amelia Earhart. For the next two years, she exercised along the west coast, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Caribbean. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, &quot;Drayton&quot; was at sea but able to participate in the post-attack efforts in search of the enemy force. During the succeeding three months, she escorted a convoy to Christmas Island, scored the first verified sinking of a Japanese submarine, (Kiritimati), screened a carrier in an airstrike on Bougainville Island, and screened a tanker to Suva Harbor, Fiji Islands. In late November 1942
&quot;Drayton&quot; became part of Task Force 67, which intercepted a Japanese naval force guarding transports en route to resupply Guadalcanal. The Battle of Tassafaronga followed.

Throughout June, July and August 1943, &quot;Drayton&quot; escorted Australian troop carriers from Townsville, Australia, to Milne Bay, New Guinea. In early September, the ship supported the amphibious landing at Lae, New Guinea. Later in September, she participated in the amphibious landing at Finschhafen, New Guinea. After escorting troops to Arawe, New Britain, in December 1943, &quot;Drayton&quot; participated in the landings there and at Borgen Bay, near Cape Gloucester, New Britain. The destroyer took part in the invasion of Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands during February 1944. She reported to the 7th Fleet in October and performed patrol and escort duty in Leyte Gulf. In December 1944, while screening a convoy to San Pedro Bay in the Philippines, a Japanese bomber attacked the ship, killing two men and wounding seven. The next day, she fought off enemy fighters; one crashed into a 5&quot;/38 caliber gun mount, killing six men and wounding twelve. By August 1945 she was on her way to New York, arriving in September. &quot;Drayton&quot; was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in December 1946. She received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Lamson&quot;===
USS &quot;Lamson&quot; shipped out of Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1937 for San Diego, California, less than a year after her naval service began. She engaged in exercises and tactical training until sailing for Pearl Harbor in October 1939. For the next two years, &quot;Lamson&quot; continued training from her base in Hawaii. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she joined the post-attack efforts to search for the Japanese strike force. In February 1942 she became part of the newly formed ANZAC Squadron, consisting of Australian, New Zealand, and American warships in Suva, Fiji Islands. In March, she operated with the squadron as a cover group southeast of Papua New Guinea. In late November 1942, &quot;Lamson&quot; was assigned to Task Force 67 and took part in the Battle of Tassafaronga.

For the next eight months, &quot;Lamson&quot; screened convoys en route to Guadalcanal. By August 1943, she had moved on to Milne Bay, New Guinea, and participated in the September amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen. In December, the ship engaged in the pre-invasion bombardment of Arawe and landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. After an overhaul and training at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Lamson&quot; joined the 7th Fleet in October 1944. In early December 1944, she took part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands. There she was struck by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; that set fire to the ship, killing 21 men and injuring 50. The fires were extinguished by a rescue tug and &quot;Lamson&quot; was saved. After extensive repairs in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, she returned to the Pacific and operated off Iwo Jima, then sailed to the United States in November 1945. In May 1946, she participated in the Able nuclear test of Operation Crossroads; she was sunk in the Baker test in July 1946. &quot;Lamson&quot; received five battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Flusser&quot;===
USS &quot;Flusser&quot; steamed her way to San Diego, California, in July 1937, after spending the first months of her naval service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She was based in San Diego until 1939, then reassigned to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Flusser&quot; was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor, but took part in the post-attack search. For the next six months, she carried out convoy duty between Pearl Harbor and the west coast, and engaged in escort and patrol duty out of southwest Pacific ports. From July 1942 to February 1943, &quot;Flusser&quot; was in overhaul status at Pearl Harbor. She returned to escort and training operations in the Solomon Islands and was later based at Milne Bay, New Guinea. During September, &quot;Flusser&quot; was part of the amphibious landing forces at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December 1943, the destroyer participated in the bombardment and landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. While attached to the 7th Fleet in February, she supported the landing of troops at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands. Between April and June 1944, the ship was in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

After her overhaul, &quot;Flusser&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor. In August, she escorted a convoy to Eniwetok and moved on to Majuro in the Marshall Islands, where she patrolled bypassed Japanese-held atolls. On a patrol off Wotje Atoll, the ship was fired on by a shore battery that left nine of her crew members wounded. In October, she sailed north to San Pedro Bay for duty in the Leyte Gulf and Surigao Strait. By early December 1944, &quot;Flusser&quot; had escorted convoys from Hollandia Jayapura to Leyte and taken part in the amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay. In March 1945, &quot;Flusser&quot; provided escort support for the landing near Cebu in the Philippines. During July she participated in the Balikpapan campaign in Borneo, escorting ships and covering the landing. After occupation duty in Okinawa during September and October, she sailed to San Diego, California, arriving in November 1945. During 1946, &quot;Flusser&quot; took part in the atomic weapons tests in the Marshall Islands. From there, she steamed to Pearl Harbor, then to Norfolk, Virginia. The destroyer was decommissioned there in December 1946 and sold in January 1948. &quot;Flusser&quot; received eight battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Reid&quot;===
USS &quot;Reid&quot; came into naval service in November 1936. From 1937 until 1941, she participated in training and fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and Pacific. &quot;Reid&quot; was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked, but escaped without damage while her gunners fired at the enemy attackers. After the attack, &quot;Reid&quot; did patrol duty in the Hawaiian waters, and later escorted convoys to San Francisco, California. Late in May 1942, &quot;Reid&quot; steamed north from Pearl Harbor to bombard the Japanese positions in Kiska and supported landings at Adak, Alaska. While conducting an anti-submarine patrol in August, she brought a Japanese submarine to the surface with a heavy depth charge barrage, and opened fire on it until it capsized and sank. Five of the submarine&#x27;s crew survived and were rescued by &quot;Reid&quot;. By October, she was patrolling the waters near New Caledonia, Samoa, and the Fiji Islands. In January 1943, the ship bombarded several Japanese locations on Guadalcanal.

During September 1943, &quot;Reid&quot; provided support for the landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December, &quot;Reid&quot; escorted troop transports for the landings at Arawe, New Britain, and participated in the landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. In the following months she supported landings at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands, Hollandia Jayapura, Wakde Island, Biak, and Noemfoor, New Guinea. &quot;Reid&quot; supported air strikes against Wake Island, and in November 1944 did patrol duty off Leyte in the Philippines.

On 11 December 1944, &quot;Reid&quot; was operating with a convoy bound for Ormoc Bay, Leyte, to resupply land forces. Late that afternoon, a group of Japanese planes descended on the convoy and penetrated the defenses, taking aim at &quot;Reid&quot; and another destroyer. The destroyers put up an anti-aircraft barrage that downed some of the planes and damaged others, but &quot;Reid&quot; was hit by five suicide planes, causing powerful explosions. Within minutes, she went to the bottom with over a hundred of her men. &quot;Reid&quot; received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Case&quot;===
USS &quot;Case&quot; began active duty in September 1936 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. In April 1940, Pearl Harbor became her home base. The following year, she participated in fleet exercises to Midway Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Atoll, Samoa, and Auckland. &quot;Case&quot; was berthed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese struck, but sustained no damage. After the attack, she escorted convoys between the west coast and Pearl Harbor until late May 1942. &quot;Case&quot; went north to support the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska and do patrol duty off Adak, Alaska. In October, the ship escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and then headed to the states for repair, returning to Pearl Harbor in November. In January 1943, she sailed to Espiritu Santo for training and remained there until September. After overhaul in San Francisco, California, &quot;Case&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in December 1943. She proceeded to the Marshall Islands, taking part in attacks on Wotje Atoll and Maloelap Atoll in late January and Eniwetok in early February 1944.

In April 1944, &quot;Case&quot; took part in air raids on Hollandia, Truk (Chuuk Lagoon), Satawan, and Ponape Island. Her next assignment was with Task Group 58.4, participating in strikes on Japanese airfields in the Bonin Islands. During June 1944, &quot;Case&quot; engaged in raids on the Mariana Islands and Vulcan Islands. Following repair work at Eniwetok, the ship resumed operations with the task group, screening for air strikes in July and for attacks on the Bonin Islands in August and September. She took part in the bombardment of Marcus Island before joining Task Group 38.1 for strikes on Luzon. While screening US cruisers bound for Saipan, &quot;Case&quot; rammed and sank a Japanese midget submarine. Undamaged, she sailed to Saipan for offshore patrol duty until early December 1944. Afterward, &quot;Case&quot; became involved in a raid on Iwo Jima airfields and helped sink two Japanese ships. Following repairs at Saipan, she patrolled between there and Iwo Jima until the end of the war. She then left Iwo Jima for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947. &quot;Case&quot; received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Conyngham&quot;===
USS &quot;Conyngham&quot; made her maiden voyage to northern Europe in early 1937, shortly after being commissioned. Following an overhaul in Boston, she sailed to San Diego, California. From October 1937 until April 1940, &quot;Conyngham&quot; operated along the west coast, the Hawaiian Islands and the Caribbean, then made her way to Pearl Harbor. In March 1941, &quot;Conyngham&quot; left Pearl Harbor on a goodwill tour to Samoa, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, and Suva in Fiji, returning in April 1941. Undamaged by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she put to sea on patrol duty that continued through December. After a brief overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Conyngham&quot; performed escort duty between the west coast and New Hebrides. Her escort assignment was interrupted to screen carriers in the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942.

During October 1942, &quot;Conyngham&quot; participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and supported the attack at the Matanikau River, Guadalcanal. In June 1943 she joined an amphibious force that later carried out landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December, she took part in the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. The next month, &quot;Conyngham&quot; participated in the landing at Saidor, New Guinea, and sailed to San Francisco for overhaul. Returning to duty in May 1944, she screened battleships in the Mariana Islands and remained there until August. &quot;Conyngham&quot; then joined a convoy screening ships to the Philippines Islands, arriving at Leyte Gulf in early November 1944. There, a floatplane (a type of seaplane) strafed her, wounding 17 men yet causing slight damage to the ship. By early December, she had covered landings at Ormoc Bay and helped with reinforcements. &quot;Conygnham&quot; left the Philippines late in December for Manus Island, New Guinea, to replenish supplies. Later on, she helped screen a convoy to Leyte for the landings at Lingayen Gulf. The ship participated in bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and remained on patrol there after the landings in January 1945. &quot;Conygham&quot; sailed to Subic Bay for overhaul in late July 1945, and remained there until the end of the war. Decommissioned in December 1946, &quot;Conyngham&quot; was used in the atomic weapons test at Bikini in 1946, and was scuttled in July 1948. She received 14 battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Cassin&quot;===
USS &quot;Cassin&quot; began naval service in August 1936, but alterations kept her from sea duty until March 1937. The next year, she joined the forces at Pearl Harbor for annual fleet exercises. In April 1940, &quot;Cassin&quot; was assigned to a Hawaiian unit. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, &quot;Cassin&quot; was in dry-dock with the battleship and the destroyer . Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck &quot;Downes,&quot; starting unstoppable fires on both destroyers. &quot;Cassin&quot; slipped off her blocks and rolled over onto the burning &quot;Downes&quot;. She was salvaged and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard and decommissioned.

&quot;Cassin&quot; was rebuilt and commissioned again in February 1944. She reported to Pearl Harbor in April and pulled escort duty until August. In October, the ship took part in the shelling of Marcus Island to destroy enemy installations. After participating in the bombardment of Iwo Jima in November 1944 and January 1945, she escorted an ammunition ship to the newly invaded Iwo Jima. There, &quot;Cassin&quot; did radar picket and air-sea rescue duty.

With the war over, she took part in guarding the air evacuation of released prisoners of war from Japan. In November 1945, the ship deployed to Norfolk, Virginia, and decommissioned there in December 1945. She was sold for scrap in November 1947. &quot;Cassin&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Shaw&quot;===
USS &quot;Shaw&quot; crossed the Atlantic on her shakedown cruise in April 1937, and returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in June. There, she began a year of yard work before completing acceptance trials. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted training exercises in the Atlantic. Sailing to the west coast, she was at the Mare Island Navy Yard from January to April 1939. By April 1940, &quot;Shaw&quot; moved on to Hawaiian waters, then back to the west coast in November for overhaul. She returned to Hawaii in February 1941, and later entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs. &quot;Shaw&quot; was still in dry dock when the Japanese attacked, with most of the ship&#x27;s crew ashore. She was hit by three bombs and severely damaged when her forward magazine exploded. Temporary repairs were made at Pearl Harbor, and in February 1942 the ship sailed to the west coast to complete them.

With repairs completed, &quot;Shaw&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in August 1942. She was then assigned to Task Force 61, and took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands in mid-October. Reassigned to a unit of the 7th Amphibious Force, &quot;Shaw&quot; escorted reinforcements to Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea, for the remainder of October and part of November. In late December, she escorted units engaged in the assault on Cape Gloucester, New Britain, and sustained casualties and damage. Thirty-six men were injured; three later died of their wounds. Temporary repairs were made at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and permanent repairs were completed at San Francisco in May 1944. &quot;Shaw&quot; then returned to Pearl Harbor.

With Task Force 52, she participated in the offensive to gain possession of the Japanese-held Mariana Islands. In January 1945, with the San Fabian Attack Force, &quot;Shaw&quot; saw action at Manila Bay in the Philippine Islands. She returned to the United States in April, stopping first at San Francisco for repairs, then routed to New York via Philadelphia for deactivation. The ship was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap in July 1946. &quot;Shaw&quot; received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Tucker&quot;===
USS &quot;Tucker&quot; was commissioned in July 1936. After her shakedown cruise, she joined the destroyer forces attached to the US Battle Fleet based in San Diego, California. In February 1939 the ship took part in a naval exercise in the Caribbean, personally observed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the cruiser . After exercises in Hawaiian waters in early 1940, &quot;Tucker&quot; operated between the west coast and Hawaii until the end of the year. By February 1941, she was back in Pearl Harbor. &quot;Tucker&quot; went on a goodwill tour that included Auckland, during March, before returning to Pearl Harbor. There, she participated in exercises at sea before sailing on to San Diego. By November 1941, &quot;Tucker&quot; was once again in Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked, the ship was berthed at East Loch undergoing tender overhaul. She was undamaged, and returned fire on the Japanese forces.

After the hostilities, &quot;Tucker&quot; patrolled off Pearl Harbor, then spent the next five months escorting convoys between the west coast and Hawaii. She later escorted the tender to Tutuila in American Samoa, Suva in the Fiji Islands, and Noum√©a in New Caledonia. The ship then escorted &quot;Wright&quot; back to Suva, arriving there in June 1942. From Suva, she escorted the cargo ship &quot;Nira Luckenbach&quot; to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, in August. The ship entered the harbor by the western entrance and struck at least one mine. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by nearby vessels. Efforts to save her were in vain; she eventually jack-knifed and went to the bottom. &quot;Tucker&quot; had steamed into a minefield placed by US forces, but she was never informed of its existence. Three men were killed and three more were listed as missing. She was removed from the Navy list in December 1944. &quot;Tucker&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.

===&quot;Downes&quot;===
USS &quot;Downes&quot; entered service in January 1937. The following November, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego, California. While based there, &quot;Downes&quot; participated in exercises along the west coast, in the Caribbean and in Hawaiian waters until April 1940. Pearl Harbor then became her homeport. In early 1941, &quot;Downes&quot; joined a cruise to Samoa, the Fiji Islands, and Australia, then visited the west coast later in the year. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, &quot;Downes&quot; was in dry-dock with the battleship &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Cassin&quot;. Both destroyers were at the southern end of the dock when an incendiary bomb struck &quot;Downes&quot;, setting unstoppable fires on both ships. &quot;Cassin&quot; slipped her blocks and rolled over onto the burning &quot;Downes&quot;, and &quot;Downes&quot; was later decommissioned.

&quot;Downes&quot; was rebuilt and recommissioned in November 1943. During March 1944, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor and on to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. By July, &quot;Downes&quot; began escort duty from Eniwetok to Saipan in support of the invasion of the Mariana Islands. Then she patrolled off Tinian during its invasion, and gave fire support during mop-up operations there. Afterward, &quot;Downes&quot; took part in the bombardment of Marcus Island to create a diversion and destroy Japanese installations, an action that Admiral Halsey later commended. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the ship screened the Fast Carrier Task Force during the air strikes on Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force. &quot;Downes&quot; served in Iwo Jima from June 1944 until the end of the war, when the ship was ordered to return to the United States, arriving at Norfolk in November 1945. She was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in November 1947. &quot;Downes&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.
===&quot;Cushing&quot;===
USS &quot;Cushing&quot; reported to the Pacific Fleet in August 1936, soon after her Navy service began. She joined the unsuccessful search for the missing Earhart during the month of July 1937. She moved on to San Diego for training exercises, continuing to operate along the west coast for the next several years. &quot;Cushing&quot; was under overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. Following the attack, she did convoy duty between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, and later operated off Midway Island on anti-submarine patrol. In August 1942, &quot;Cushing&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and later joined operations around Guadalcanal.

With Task Force 61, &quot;Cushing&quot; took part in the bitterly contested Battle of Santa Cruz in October 1942. Outnumbered, the force stalled the Japanese from their advance toward Guadalcanal. At the Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Cushing&quot; was perhaps the first US ship to strike the enemy on that November day in 1942. In the fighting that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the . In his book, &quot;Destroyer Operations in World War II&quot; (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, &quot; Three of the &quot;fish&quot; seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But &quot;Hiei&quot;‚Ä≥s lookouts must have seen them coming, for the big ship swung her bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.&quot;
By this time, &quot;Cushing&quot; was dead in the water, an easy target for repeated enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. &quot;Cushing&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Perkins&quot;===
USS &quot;Perkins&quot; was commissioned in September 1936 and San Diego, California, became her homeport. She operated in the eastern Pacific prior to World War II, and was at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. In mid-December, she escorted a convoy to Pearl Harbor, returned to Mare Island for new radar gear, and sailed back to Pearl Harbor the latter part of January 1942. The following month, &quot;Perkins&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and joined Australian, New Zealand, and other US ships in the ANZAC Squadron, charged with protecting the eastern approaches to Australia and New Zealand. She continued operations with ANZAC until April. In May 1942, &quot;Perkins&quot; participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. After that, propeller problems took her to New Zealand and to Pearl Harbor, where repairs were completed. While at Pearl Harbor, additional radar gear and 40¬†mm guns were installed.

By November 1942 &quot;Perkins&quot; was with Task Force 67, led by Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright. In the nighttime Battle of Tassafaronga, the force intercepted the Japanese to stop them from supplying Guadalcanal. Undamaged in the encounter, &quot;Perkins&quot; headed for Tulagi where she bombarded the Guadalcanal coast and served on escort assignments until January 1943. She joined Task Force 76, an amphibious group, in March. In September 1943, &quot;Perkins&quot; bombarded Lae, New Guinea, and supported the landings there. She took part in the successful landings at Finschhafen, New Guinea. Late in November, the ship was bound from Milne Bay to Buna, steaming independently, when &quot;Duntroon&quot;, an Australian troopship, accidentally collided with her. &quot;Perkins&quot; broke in two and quickly sank; nine of the crew went down with her. &quot;Perkins&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Smith&quot;===
USS &quot;Smith&quot; began her US naval service in September 1936, and operated along the west coast of the United States for the next five years. From the start of World War II until April 1942, she was based in San Francisco, California, attached to a destroyer squadron. In June, &quot;Smith&quot; was in Pearl Harbor, engaged in training exercises, then escorted a convoy back to San Francisco. After overhaul and sea trials in the bay area, &quot;Smith&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in August. By October she was part of Task Force 61, participating in the Battle of Santa Cruz. In the course of the battle, a Japanese torpedo plane crashed into her; the explosion ignited the forward part of the ship. The crew eventually extinguished the fires, and &quot;Smith&quot; was able to retain her position in the screen. When the air cleared, 28 were dead and 23 wounded. She was patched up enough in New Caledonia to make her way to Pearl Harbor, where she was under overhaul until February 1943. The next few months, &quot;Smith&quot; performed anti-submarine patrols, did convoy duty, and participated in Navy exercises. In September and October, she was part of the amphibious landings at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In late December 1943 &quot;Smith&quot; was attached to Task Force 76, and took part in landing the 1st Marine Division at Cape Gloucester, New Britain.

In January 1944, &quot;Smith&quot; participated in the amphibious landing near Saidor, New Guinea, led by Barbey. In February, she bombarded designated targets in preparation for the landing at Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands. By the middle of March, &quot;Smith&quot; sailed to the west coast for overhaul. Completed in June, she returned to Pearl Harbor for training exercises and gunnery practice. Attached to the 7th Fleet in October, &quot;Smith&quot; sailed to Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. There, she was positioned northeast of Ponson Island as a fighter director ship for the landing at Ormoc Bay in December 1944. During January 1945, &quot;Smith&quot; supported the landings in Lingayen Gulf, Philippine Islands. In late June, she bombarded Balikpapan, Borneo, in preparation for the landing by an Australian force. &quot;Smith&quot; departed the Philippines on 15 August 1945 for Buckner Bay, remaining there until steaming to Nagasaki Harbor, Kyushu, Japan, on 15 September, arriving there just 37 days after the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 by US forces.
There the ship boarded 80 US military ex-prisoners of war, taking them to Okinawa for transfer to the United States. On 21 September &quot;Smith&quot; returned to Nagasaki and picked up 90 Allied prisoners of war, taking them to Bickner Bay. She arrived in Sasebo, Nagasaki, on 28 September and departed two days later for San Diego via Pearl Harbor. Docking at San Diego on 19 November, she remained there until ordered to Pearl Harbor on 28 December, arriving there on 3 January 1946 and assumed an inactive status. The ship was decommissioned on 28 June 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 25 February 1947. &quot;Smith&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Preston&quot;===
USS &quot;Preston&quot; was in service from October 1936 until November 1942. Following shakedown, she served briefly under the Chief of Naval Operations, then joined the US Fleet. &quot;Preston&quot; did peacetime training exercises into the month of December 1941, and performed patrol and escort duties along the west coast until June 1942. After that, she screened the carrier to Hawaii, followed by four months of patrol and escort work in Hawaiian waters.

In October she became part of Task Force 61 and participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz. In mid-November 1942, &quot;Preston&quot; sailed to the western end of Guadalcanal to intercept another run by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field. In the ensuing skirmish, &quot;Preston&quot; was hit by a salvo from a Japanese cruiser that put both fire rooms out of commission and toppled the aft stack. Her fires made an easy target; as they spread, the order was given to abandon ship. The ship rolled onto her side and sank, taking 116 of her crew with her. &quot;Preston&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Dunlap&quot;===
USS &quot;Dunlap&quot; became part of the US Navy in June 1937. A year later, she served as an escort at Philadelphia for the steamer , which carried Gustaf Adolf, the Crown Prince of Sweden. By April 1940, Pearl Harbor was &quot;Dunlap&quot;&#x27;s homeport. When the Japanese attacked, &quot;Dunlap&quot; was at sea bound for Pearl Harbor; she entered port the following day. In January, she sortied for air strikes on the Marshall Islands, and in February she took part in a raid on Wake Island. Afterward, &quot;Dunlap&quot; patrolled Hawaiian waters, escorted convoys between various ports on the west coast, and returned to Pearl Harbor in October 1942. In December, the destroyer moved on to Noumea, New Caledonia, and operated from there until July 1943.
&quot;Dunlap&quot; saw action at Vella Gulf in the Solomon Islands in a nighttime torpedo clash. In &quot;United States Destroyer Operations in World War II&quot; (1953), Theodore Roscoe wrote: &quot;In the Battle of Vella Gulf, as this engagement was called, the enemy had not laid a hand on the American ships.&quot;

After overhaul in San Diego, &quot;Dunlap&quot; performed patrol duty out of Adak, Alaska, in November and December 1943 and sailed to Pearl Harbor. From January until March 1944, she screened carriers in strikes on the Marshall Islands with the 5th Fleet. After that, &quot;Dunlap&quot; took part in strikes on the Soerabaja area of Java in May and returned to Pearl Harbor in June. In July, she sailed to San Francisco to join the screen for the heavy cruiser &quot;Baltimore&quot;, which carried Roosevelt for conferences and inspections with top Pacific commanders of Pearl Harbor and Alaskan bases. In early September 1944, &quot;Dunlap&quot; participated in the shelling of Wake Island. In October 1944, she lent a hand in the bombardment of Marcus Island. By January 1945, the ship was involved in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and Chichi-jima. On 3 September 1945, Commodore John H. Magruder accepted the surrender of the Bonin Islands by Lt. General Yoshio Tachibana on board the destroyer. &quot;Dunlap&quot; sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, in November 1945, where she was decommissioned in December 1945 and sold in December 1947. She received six battle stars for her World War II service.

===&quot;Fanning&quot;===
USS &quot;Fanning&quot; was occupied with sea trials and minor repairs for the first six months of her naval service. In April 1938, she escorted the light cruiser from Annapolis, Maryland, to the Caribbean with Roosevelt aboard.
&quot;Fanning&quot; sailed to New York for overhaul the following month; in September she moved on to her new base in San Diego, California. Over the next three years, her duties took her to the east coast and eventually to Hawaii. The ship was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor; she returned the following day. Underway for Tutuila in January 1942, &quot;Fanning&quot; encountered a blinding rainstorm and collided with . Both destroyers suffered bow damage and were forced to return to Pearl Harbor. In April 1942 &quot;Fanning&quot; became part of Task Force 16, which supported the Doolittle Raid on the air strike against Tokyo. After the mission, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

For the first nine months of 1943, &quot;Fanning&quot; deployed against the Japanese on Guadalcanal, supported an occupation force on the Russell Islands, participated in patrol duty, and assisted in the protection of troops occupying Munda, Solomon Islands. In September, she had an overhaul on the west coast, then finished the year operating off the Aleutian Islands. By January 1944, &quot;Fanning&quot; was operating with Task Group 58.4 in the Marshall Islands. In March she reported to the Eastern Fleet (British units, reinforced with Australian, Dutch and French warships), participating in strikes against Sabang, Indonesia, the next month. Detached from the Eastern Fleet in May, &quot;Fanning&quot; sailed to the west coast. In July she left San Diego, escorting the heavy cruiser &quot;Baltimore&quot; to Alaska with Roosevelt on board. Her next assignment was with Task Group 30.2, shelling Marcus Island in October 1944 to create a diversion and destroy enemy installations. During January 1945, &quot;Fanning&quot; took part in the shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and Chichi-Jima. For the remainder of the war, she was occupied with patrol and escort activities. In September 1945, she sailed for the United States, and was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, in December 1945; she was sold for scrap in 1948. &quot;Fanning&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>The Pottery Barn rule is an American expression alluding to a policy of &quot;you break it, you&#x27;ve bought it&quot; or &quot;you break it, you buy it&quot; or &quot;you break it, you remake it&quot;, by which a retail store holds a customer responsible for damage done to merchandise on display. It generally &quot;encourages customers to be more careful when handling property that&#x27;s not theirs&quot;. It is an analogy often used in the political or military arena to suggest that if an actor inadvertently creates a problem, the actor is obliged to provide the resources necessary to correct it.

==Origin==
The phrase &quot;If you break it, you&#x27;ve bought it&quot; was reportedly first used in 1952 by a Miami Beach gift shop, who posted the message over their fragile merchandise.

Individually operated furnishing stores selling fragile goods (art, pottery, and sculptures) often post a &quot;you break it, you buy it&quot; sign. According to legal experts, &#x27;If the sign is big enough, and prominently displayed, it can be argued that you were given what lawyers call &quot;sufficient notice&quot;&#x27; and &#x27;In this case, just by entering the store you agree to the terms of the sign, even if you didn&#x27;t read it&#x27;. In addition, it is the customer&#x27;s responsibility to be careful in a premises with many fragile valuable goods; so careless behavior such as an untied shoelace or horsing around can be regarded as negligent. However the rule is rarely enforced, as the establishment cannot detain a customer for non-payment of damages and instead would have to file a civil suit against that customer. In actual practice even a civil suit is unlikely if the patron lacks the means to pay, such as damaged artwork in a museum that could be worth millions.

In reality, Pottery Barn, a chain of upscale home furnishing stores in the United States, does not have a &quot;you break it, you bought it&quot; policy, but instead writes off broken merchandise as a loss, as do most large American retailers. Legal doctrine also holds that a retailer incurs the risk that merchandise will be destroyed by placing it where customers can handle it and not doing anything to discourage them.

==Political usage==
&quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Thomas L. Friedman claims to have coined the term, having used the phrase &quot;the pottery store rule&quot; in a February 12, 2003, column. He has said he referred to Pottery Barn specifically in speeches. 
According to &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Bob Woodward, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell cited the rule in the summer of 2002 when warning President George W. Bush of the consequences of his planned military action in Iraq:

&quot;You are going to be the proud owner of 25 million people,&quot; he told the president. &quot;You will own all their hopes, aspirations, and problems. You&#x27;ll own it all.&quot; Privately, Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage called this the Pottery Barn rule: You break it, you own it.

Powell confirmed the quotation on Jonathan Dimbleby&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; program on April 30, 2006.

Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry cited the rule and attributed it to Powell in debating Bush on policy on the Iraq war during the first debate of the 2004 Presidential election:

KERRY: Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president [Bush] the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it. Now, if you break it, you made a mistake. It&#x27;s the wrong thing to do. But you own it. And then you&#x27;ve got to fix it and do something with it. Now that&#x27;s what we have to do. There&#x27;s no inconsistency. Soldiers know over there that this isn&#x27;t being done right yet. I&#x27;m going to get it right for those soldiers, because it&#x27;s important to Israel, it&#x27;s important to America, it&#x27;s important to the world, it&#x27;s important to the fight on terror. But I have a plan to do it. He [Bush] doesn&#x27;t.

Powell denies using the term &quot;pottery barn rule&quot;, but stated:

It is said that I used the &quot;Pottery Barn rule.&quot; I never did it; [Thomas] Friedman did it ... But what I did say ... [is that] once you break it, you are going to own it, and we&#x27;re going to be responsible for 26 million people standing there looking at us. And it&#x27;s going to suck up a good 40 to 50 percent of the Army for years. And it&#x27;s going to take all the oxygen out of the political environment ...&quot;

<doc id="612245" wikidata="Q4150823" url="?curid=612245" title="Thompson groups">
<text>In mathematics, the Thompson groups (also called Thompson&#x27;s groups, vagabond groups or chameleon groups) are three groups, commonly denoted formula_1, that were introduced by Richard Thompson in some unpublished handwritten notes in 1965 as a possible counterexample to the von Neumann conjecture. Of the three, &quot;F&quot; is the most widely studied, and is sometimes referred to as the Thompson group or Thompson&#x27;s group.

The Thompson groups, and &quot;F&quot; in particular, have a collection of unusual properties that have made them counterexamples to many general conjectures in group theory. All three Thompson groups are infinite but finitely presented. The groups &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are (rare) examples of infinite but finitely-presented simple groups. The group &quot;F&quot; is not simple but its derived subgroup [&quot;F&quot;,&quot;F&quot;] is and the quotient of &quot;F&quot; by its derived subgroup is the free abelian group of rank 2. &quot;F&quot; is totally ordered, has exponential growth, and does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to the free group of rank 2.

It is conjectured that &quot;F&quot; is not amenable and hence a further counterexample to the long-standing but recently disproved
von Neumann conjecture for finitely-presented groups: it is known that &quot;F&quot; is not elementary amenable.

 introduced an infinite family of finitely presented simple groups, including Thompson&#x27;s group &quot;V&quot; as a special case.

==Presentations==

A finite presentation of &quot;F&quot; is given by the following expression:

:formula_2

where [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;] is the usual group theory commutator, &quot;xyx&quot;‚àí1&quot;y&quot;‚àí1.

Although &quot;F&quot; has a finite presentation with 2 generators and 2 relations,
it is most easily and intuitively described by the infinite presentation:

:formula_3

The two presentations are related by &quot;x&quot;0=&quot;A&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;A&quot;1‚àí&quot;n&quot;&quot;BA&quot;&quot;n&quot;‚àí1 for &quot;n&quot;&gt;0.

==Other representations==
The group &quot;F&quot; also has realizations in terms of operations on ordered rooted binary trees, and as a subgroup of the piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval that preserve orientation and whose non-differentiable points are dyadic rationals and whose slopes are all powers of 2.

The group &quot;F&quot; can also be considered as acting on the unit circle by identifying the two endpoints of the unit interval, and the group &quot;T&quot; is then the group of automorphisms of the unit circle obtained by adding the homeomorphism &quot;x&quot;‚Üí&quot;x&quot;+1/2 mod 1 to &quot;F&quot;. On binary trees this corresponds to exchanging the two trees below the root. The group &quot;V&quot; is obtained from &quot;T&quot; by adding the discontinuous map that fixes the points of the half-open interval [0,1/2) and exchanges [1/2,3/4) and [3/4,1) in the obvious way. On binary trees this corresponds to exchanging the two trees below the right-hand descendant of the root (if it exists).

The Thompson group &quot;F&quot; is the group of order-preserving automorphisms of the free J√≥nsson‚ÄìTarski algebra on one generator.

==Amenability==
The conjecture of Thompson that &quot;F&quot; is not amenable was further popularized by R. Geoghegan‚Äîsee also the Cannon‚ÄìFloyd‚ÄìParry article cited in the references below. Its current status is open: E. Shavgulidze published a paper in 2009 in which he claimed to prove that &quot;F&quot; is amenable, but an error was found, as is explained in the MR review.

It is known that &quot;F&quot; is not elementary amenable, see Theorem 4.10 in Cannon‚ÄìFloyd‚ÄìParry. 

If &quot;F&quot; is not amenable, then it would be another counterexample to the now disproved von Neumann conjecture for finitely-presented groups, which states that a finitely-presented group is amenable if and only if it does not contain a copy of the free group of rank 2.

==Connections with topology==

The group &quot;F&quot; was rediscovered at least twice by topologists during the 1970s. In a paper that was only published much later but was in circulation as a preprint at that time, P. Freyd and A. Heller showed that the &quot;shift map&quot; on &quot;F&quot; induces an unsplittable homotopy idempotent on the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space &quot;K(F,1)&quot; and that this is universal in an interesting sense. This is explained in detail in Geoghegan&#x27;s book (see references below). Independently, J. Dydak and P. Minc created a less well-known model of &quot;F&quot; in connection with a problem in shape theory.

In 1979, R. Geoghegan made four conjectures about &quot;F&quot;: (1) &quot;F&quot; has type FP‚àû; (2) All homotopy groups of &quot;F&quot; at infinity are trivial; (3) &quot;F&quot; has no non-abelian free subgroups; (4) &quot;F&quot; is non-amenable. (1) was proved by K. S. Brown and R. Geoghegan in a strong form: there is a K(F,1) with two cells in each positive dimension. (2) was also proved by Brown and Geoghegan in the sense that the cohomology H*(F,ZF) was shown to be trivial; since a previous theorem of M. Mihalik implies that &quot;F&quot; is simply connected at infinity, and the stated result implies that all homology at infinity vanishes, the claim about homotopy groups follows. (3) was proved by M. Brin and C. Squier. The status of (4) is discussed above.

It is unknown if &quot;F&quot; satisfies the Farrell‚ÄìJones conjecture. It is even unknown if the Whitehead group of &quot;F&quot; (see Whitehead torsion) or the projective class group of &quot;F&quot; (see Wall&#x27;s finiteness obstruction) is trivial, though it easily shown that &quot;F&quot; satisfies the strong Bass conjecture.

D. Farley has shown that &quot;F&quot; acts as deck transformations on a locally finite CAT(0) cubical complex (necessarily of infinite dimension). A consequence is that &quot;F&quot; satisfies the Baum‚ÄìConnes conjecture.

<text>The Zilog Z180 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog as a successor to the Z80. It is compatible with the large base of software written for the Z80. The Z180 family adds higher performance and integrated peripheral functions like clock generator, 16-bit counters/timers, interrupt controller, wait-state generators, serial ports and a DMA controller. It uses separate read and write strobes, sharing similar timings with the Z80 and Intel processors. The on-chip memory management unit (MMU) has the capability of addressing up to 1 MB of memory. It is possible to configure the Z180 to operate as the Hitachi HD64180.

==Variants==
==Z80182==
The Zilog Z80182, introduced in 1997, is an enhanced, faster version of the older Z80 and is part of the Z180 microprocessor family. It is nicknamed the &quot;Zilog Intelligent Peripheral Controller&quot; (ZIP). It is also fully static (the clock can be halted and no data in the registers will be lost) and has a low EMI option that reduces the slew rate of the outputs.

The Z80182 can operate at 33¬†MHz with an external oscillator for 5-volt operation, or at 20¬†MHz using the internal oscillator for 3.3-volt operation.

Throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s he was a prolific studio musician, including playing organ on the Bob Dylan song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, French horn and piano on the Rolling Stones song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, and lead guitar on Rita Coolidge&#x27;s &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Sale&quot;. He also joined and named Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. However, he did not stay with the group long enough to share its popularity. Kooper produced a number of one-off collaboration albums, such as the &quot;Super Session&quot; album that saw him work separately with guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Stephen Stills. In the 1970s Kooper was a successful manager and producer, recording Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s first three albums. He has had a successful solo career, writing music for film soundtracks, and has lectured in musical composition. Kooper was selected for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

== Early life ==
Kooper was Alan Peter Kuperschmidt born in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 5, 1944. He grew up in a Jewish family in Queens.

==Career==
===Professional debut===
Kooper&#x27;s first professional work was as a 14-year-old guitarist in the Royal Teens, best known for their 1958 ABC Records novelty song &quot;Short Shorts&quot; (although Kooper did not play on that recording). In 1960, he teamed up with songwriters Bob Brass and Irwin Levine to write and record demos for Sea-Lark Music Publishing. The trio&#x27;s biggest hits were &quot;This Diamond Ring&quot;, recorded by Gary Lewis and the Playboys, and &quot;I Must Be Seeing Things&quot;, recorded by Gene Pitney (both 1965). When he was 21, Kooper moved to Greenwich Village in Manhattan.

===With Bob Dylan===
He first performed with Bob Dylan playing the Hammond organ riffs on &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. He had been invited to watch the recording by producer Tom Wilson. In those recording sessions, Kooper met and befriended Mike Bloomfield, whose guitar playing he admired. He worked with Bloomfield for several years. In 1965, Kooper played with Dylan in concert and played Hammond organ with Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival and in the recording studio in 1965 and 1966. He played organ once again with Dylan during his 1981 world tour.

===The Blues Project and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears===
Kooper joined the Blues Project as their keyboardist in 1965. He left the band shortly before their gig at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, although he did play a solo set, as evidenced by The Criterion Collection Blu-ray extended edition of the event. He formed Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears in 1967, leaving due to creative differences in 1968, after the release of the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Child Is Father to the Man&quot;. He recorded &quot;Super Session&quot; with Bloomfield and Stephen Stills in 1968, and in 1969 he collaborated with 15-year-old guitarist Shuggie Otis on the album &quot;Kooper Session&quot;. In 1972, he rejoined The Blues Project at a charity concert promoted by Bruce Blakeman at Valley Stream Central High School.

===Other work===
====As musician====
Kooper has played on hundreds of records, including ones by the Rolling Stones, B.B. King, the Who, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Alice Cooper, and Cream. On occasion he overdubbed his own efforts, as on &quot;The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper&quot; and other albums, under the pseudonym &quot;Roosevelt Gook&quot;.

====As record producer====
In 1969, Kooper produced, arranged, and conducted the album &quot;Appaloosa&quot;, a &quot;folk-baroque&quot; style of music that combined rock and classical. Among other artists who were all arranging folk-oriented material with classical-influenced orchestration were Judy Collins, Donovan, Tim Hardin, and Tom Rush. Kooper was joined by Boston musicians John Parker Compton, singer and acoustic guitarist, Robin Batteau on violin, Eugene Rosov on cello, and David Reiser on electric bass. Contributing to the album was saxophonist Fred Lipsius and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears drummer Bobby Colomby. After moving to Atlanta in 1972, he discovered the band Lynyrd Skynyrd, and produced and performed on their first three albums, including the singles &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot;. In 1975 he produced the debut album of the Tubes.

====TV scores====
Kooper wrote the scores for the TV series &quot;Crime Story&quot; and the film &quot;The Landlord&quot;, as well as several made-for-television movies. He was the musical force behind many pop tunes, including &quot;You&#x27;re the Lovin&#x27; End&quot;, for &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, a children&#x27;s television program.

====Studio====
In the late 1980s, Kooper had his own dedicated keyboard studio in the historic Sound Emporium recording studio in Nashville, next to Studio B.

====Rock Bottom Remainders====
Kooper&#x27;s status as a published author enabled him to join (and act as musical director of) the Rock Bottom Remainders, a band made up of writers including Dave Barry, Stephen King, Amy Tan, and Matt Groening.

====New Music For Old People====
Kooper wrote a column called &quot;New Music For Old People&quot; for the online publication The Morton Report from April 2014 to April 2015. This later led to a radio show by the same name, which began in October 2018, for Martha&#x27;s Vineyard community radio station WVVY-LP. The first 11 editions can be found online.

====Magazine writer====
Kooper profiled Steve Martin for Crawdaddy Magazine in 1977.

====Kooperkast====

Kooper&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Kooperkast&quot; started in late 2020. Hosted by webmaster Jon Sachs, Kooper discusses his experiences in his more than 60 years in the music industry, including his solo albums, Bob Dylan and Lynyrd Skynyrd. He answers questions that can be submitted on the Kooperkast page on his website.

===Honors, awards, and legacy===

In May 2001, Kooper was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music in Boston. He taught songwriting and recording production there. He plays weekend concerts with his bands the ReKooperators and the Funky Faculty. In 2008, he participated in the production of the album &quot;Psalngs&quot;, the debut release of Canadian musician John Lefebvre.

Kooper was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, in Nashville, in 2008.

In 2005, Martin Scorsese produced a documentary titled &quot;No Direction Home: Bob Dylan&quot; for the PBS American Masters Series, in which Kooper&#x27;s contributions are recognized.

In 2023, Kooper was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Award for Musical Excellence category.

==Memoir==
Kooper published a memoir, &quot;Backstage Passes: Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Life in the Sixties&quot; (1977), which was revised and published as &quot;Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Survivor&quot; (1998). The revised edition includes indictments of &quot;manipulators&quot; in the music industry, including his one-time business manager, Stan Polley. An updated edition, including supplementary material, was published by Backbeat Books in 2008.

Kooper is portrayed by Charlie Tahan in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

The Z80000 is a 32-bit expansion of the 16-bit Zilog Z8000 with multiprocessing capability, a six-stage instruction pipeline, and a 256-byte cache. It can address 4¬†gigabytes of RAM, but cannot execute code written for the Z8000 or Z80.

Described at the time as a &quot;mainframe on a chip&quot;, the processor is in many ways an equivalent to Intel&#x27;s 80386. Delays in the initial manufacturing pushed back its availability date to after that of the 386, and the Z80000 only made it to a test sampling phase without ever being released commercially.

==Description==
Like the Z8000 it is based on, the Z80000 has sixteen general-purpose registers, but expanded from the Z8000&#x27;s 16-bit to 32-bit. Like the Z8000, the Z80000 allows its registers to be combined, in this case using two 32-bit registers to act as a single 64-bit one. To support the Z8000s 16-bit wide data, the Z80000 can place two 16-bit values in a single 32-register.

The processor includes a memory management unit that provides protected memory, important for multitasking, and virtual memory addressing for temporary storage of RAM on a hard disk. The processor has three methods of accessing memory:

* compact mode¬†‚Äì meant for small programs, could only access 64¬†KB (16-bit addresses, equivalent to the Z8000&#x27;s non-segmented mode). Address bits 31-16 of all virtual addresses comes from address bits 31-16 of the program counter.
* segmented mode¬†‚Äì 32,768 segments of 64¬†KB (16-bit address; comprising memory from 0-2GB) &quot;and&quot; 128 segments of 16¬†MB (24-bit address; comprising memory from 2GB-4GB), making a total of 4¬†GB (32-bit address) of accessible memory.
* linear mode¬†‚Äì direct 4¬†GB (32-bit address) accessible memory

On the Z80000 CPU, interrupts are part of a category known as exceptions. This category includes resets, bus errors, interrupts, and traps.

The processor is designed to interoperate with other integrated circuits designed for use with the Z8000, such as the Zilog Z8070 floating-point coprocessor.

The Z320 was the CMOS version of the Z80000.

<text>Ausserbinn is a former municipality of the canton of Valais, Switzerland, and now part of the municipality of Ernen. Prior to its incorporation within Ernen, it was one of Switzerland&#x27;s smallest municipalities with a population of only 47 as of 2000.

The village covers a total area of 4.5¬†km¬≤ and ranges in elevation from 1100 m to 2500 m on the mountain of Eggerhorn. The centre lies at 1300 m above sea level. Ausserbinn is situated in the Binn Valley, well known for its abundant flora and minerals.

A Postbus route connects Ausserbinn to the railway station at Fiesch.

==Merger==
In a referendum held on 5 November 2002, 19 opposed and 14 voted in favour of a union with the neighbouring municipalities of Ernen, M√ºhlebach, and Steinhaus. Despite the vote, the cantonal authorities pressed ahead with plans for the merger, declaring that the municipalities would be merged on 1 October 2004. A legal appeal by the inhabitants to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland was unsuccessful and in spring 2005 Ausserbinn became part of Ernen.

<doc id="612265" wikidata="Q5399951" url="?curid=612265" title="Essoin">
<text>In old English law, an essoin (, , Anglo-Norman, from Old French: &quot;essoignier&quot;, &quot;to excuse&quot;) is an excuse for nonappearance in court. Essoining is the seeking of the same. The person sent to deliver the excuse to the court is an essoiner or essoineur.

There were several kinds of essoins in common law in the Middle Ages:
* An essoin de malo lecti, the &quot;excuse of the bed of sickness&quot;, was an excuse that the person was too ill to get out of bed, and was generally only invoked in civil actions involving real property. This required that the invoker be observed in bed by a commission of four knights.
* An essoin de ultra mare, the &quot;excuse of being overseas&quot; (literally &quot;beyond the sea&quot;), was an excuse that the person was abroad. The only resultant delay to litigation permissible for this excuse was enough time for word to be sent to the person and for them to return to England (&quot;forty days and one ebb and one flood&quot; being a conventional formula), and the excuse could only be invoked once, at the start of litigation.
* An essoin de servicio (or per servitium) regis, the &quot;excuse of the King&#x27;s service&quot;, was the excuse that the person concerned was in the King&#x27;s service at the time and thus unavailable. It required the production of the King&#x27;s writ of service for proof. By the Statute of Essoins 1318 (12 Edw. 2. Stat. 2), women (with a few exceptions) could not make this excuse.
* An essoin de malo veniendi, the &quot;excuse of becoming ill en route&quot;, was the excuse that the person had fallen ill on the way to court. It originally required either some form of proof from the messenger who carried word that the person had fallen ill, or the sworn testimony of the person concerned that he had been ill once he finally arrived at court. However, during the 13th century these requirements gradually came to be waived, and even considered to be oppressive.

Essoins were originally received at court on essoin day, the first day of the term of the court. However, by 11 Geo. 4 and 1 Will. 4, essoin days were abolished. Essoins, and the day to which proceedings had as a result been adjourned, would be entered on an essoin roll.

<text>The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Austrian Galicia or colloquially Austrian Poland, was a constituent possession of the Habsburg monarchy in the historical region of Galicia in Eastern Europe. The crownland was established in 1772. The lands were annexed from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as part of the First Partition of Poland. In 1804 it became a crownland of the newly proclaimed Austrian Empire. From 1867 it was a crownland within the Cisleithanian or Austrian half of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. It maintained a degree of provincial autonomy. Its status remained unchanged until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918.

The domain was initially carved in 1772 from the south-western part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. During the following period, several territorial changes occurred. In 1795 the Habsburg monarchy participated in the Third Partition of Poland and annexed additional Polish-held territory, that was renamed as &quot;West Galicia&quot;. That region was lost in 1809. Some other changes also occurred, by territorial expansion or contraction (1786, 1803, 1809, 1815, 1846, 1849). After 1849, borders of the crownland remained stable until 1918.

The name &quot;Galicia&quot; is a Latinized form of Halych, one of several regional principalities of the medieval Kievan Rus&#x27;. The name &quot;Lodomeria&quot; is also a Latinized form of the original Slavic name of Vladimir, that was founded in the 10th century by Vladimir the Great. The title &quot;King of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot; was a late medieval royal title created by Andrew II of Hungary during his conquest of the region in the 13th century. Since that time, the title &quot;King of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot; was included among many ceremonial titles used by the kings of Hungary, thus creating the basis for later (1772) Habsburg claims. In the aftermath of the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars, the region was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland in the 14th century and remained in Poland until the 18th-century partitions.

After World War I, Galicia became part of the Second Polish Republic. Then, as a result of border changes following World War II, the region of Galicia became divided between the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (Republic of Poland until 1952) and the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union, now Poland and Ukraine. The nucleus of historic Galicia broadly corresponds to the modern Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk regions of western Ukraine while the western part makes up the bulk of the Polish Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian Voivodeships and a large part of the Silesian Voivodeship.

==Ceremonial name==
The name of the Kingdom in its ceremonial form, in Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria with the Grand Duchy of Krak√≥w and the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator, existed in all languages spoken there including ; ; , and .

==History==


Galicia was the largest part of the area annexed by the Habsburg monarchy in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. As such, the newly annexed territory was named the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria to underline the Hungarian claims to the country. In the Third Partition of Poland, a large portion of the ethnically Polish lands to the northwest was also annexed by the Habsburgs; this, along with some of the westernmost ethnically Polish parts of the first partition territory, became West Galicia (or New Galicia), which changed the geographical reference of the term &quot;Galicia&quot;. Lviv (Lemberg in German) served as the capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly Ukrainians. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ukrainians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.

During the first decades of Austrian rule, Galicia was firmly governed from Vienna, and many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy staffed largely by Germans and Czechs. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattels, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord&#x27;s permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The eastern-rite Uniate Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the Greek Catholic Church to bring it on a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, the Austrian Empire extracted from Galicia considerable wealth and conscripted large numbers of the peasant population into its armed services.

===From 1809 to 1860===
In 1809, during the Napoleonic wars, Austria was forced in the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn to cede all of its third partition gains, plus Zamo≈õƒá and some other areas, to the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw, and some eastern areas around Ternopil to the Russian Empire. (For details, see .) In 1815, after the Napoleonic wars, the Congress of Vienna returned Ternopil and a few other territories to Austria, but assigned the bulk of the formerly-Austrian territory of the Duchy of Warsaw to Congress Poland (Kingdom of Poland), which was ruled by the Tsar. The city of Krak√≥w and surrounding territory, formerly also part of New or West Galicia, became the semi-autonomous Free City of Krak√≥w under the supervision of the three powers that ruled Poland (i.e. Austria, Russia, and Prussia).
The 1820s and 1830s were periods of bureaucratic rule that was overseen by Vienna. Most administrative positions were filled by German speakers, including German-speaking Czechs. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830‚Äì31, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The late 1830s period was rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations whose work culminated in the unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846. This uprising was easily put down by the Austrians with the help of a Galician peasantry that remained loyal to the emperor. The uprising occurred in the Polish-populated part of Galicia. Polish manorial gentry supported or were sympathetic to plans for an uprising to establish an independent Polish state, but peasants on the manorial estates of western Galicia, reduced to misery by poor harvests, saw little advantage for themselves in a free Poland. Instead, they seized the opportunity to rise against the institution of serfdom by killing many of the estate owners. With the collapse of the uprising for a free Poland, the city of Krak√≥w lost its semi-autonomy and was integrated into the Austrian Empire under the title of a Grand Duchy. In practice, it was administered by the Austrian authorities as if it was part of Galicia.

In the same period, a sense of national awakening began to develop among the Ruthenians in the eastern part of Galicia. A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiian Shashkevych, published &quot;Rusalka Dnistrovaia&quot; (The Nymph of the Dniester), a collection of folksongs and other materials in vernacular Ukrainian (then called &quot;rusynska&quot;, Ruthenian). Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.

In 1848, revolutionary actions broke out in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire. In Lviv, a Polish National Council, and then later, a Ukrainian, or Ruthenian Supreme Council were formed. Even before Vienna had acted, the remnants of serfdom were abolished by the Governor, Franz Stadion, in an attempt to thwart the revolutionaries. Moreover, Polish demands for Galician autonomy were countered by Ruthenian demands for national equality and for a partition of the province into an Eastern, Ruthenian part, and a Western, Polish part. Eventually, Lviv was bombarded by imperial troops and the revolution put down completely.

A decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count Agenor Goluchowski, a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.

===Constitutional experiments===

In 1859, following the Austro-Hungarian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the Vienna Government, influenced by Agenor Goluchowski, issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de-centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a legislative assembly, the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria ( in Polish). Although at first pro-Habsburg Ukrainian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ukrainian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ukrainian representatives and the diet became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further autonomy. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The diet ceased to sit.

By 1863, an open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and from 1864 to 1865 the Austro-Hungarian government declared a state of siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties.

The year 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by Goluchowski and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again.

Meanwhile, the Ruthenians felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the Old Ruthenians grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as Russophiles. At the same time, influenced by the Ukrainian language poetry of the central Ukrainian writer, Taras Shevchenko, an opposing Ukrainophile movement arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian language and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as Populists , and later, as Ukrainians. Almost all Ruthenians, however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.

===Galician autonomy===
In 1866, following the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian √©lites.

Finally, after the so-called of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist Austria-Hungary. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and intelligentsia addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years, a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy.

From 1873, Galicia was &quot;de facto&quot; an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and, to a lesser degree, Ukrainian or Ruthenian, as official languages. The Germanisation had been halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Cisleithanian jurisdiction of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galician Sejm and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.

These changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists in Krak√≥w, including J√≥zef Szujski, Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski, Stanis≈Çaw Ko≈∫mian and Ludwik Wodzicki, published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sta≈Ñczyk&#x27;s Portfolio&quot;). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested compromise with Poland&#x27;s enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the political concessions offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak√≥w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the &quot;Podolians&quot;, they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from Vienna to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided between Ukrainophiles, who looked to Kyiv and the common people for historic connection, and Russophiles who stressed their connections to Russia.

Both Vienna and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the &quot;Populist&quot; Ruthenians or Ukrainians which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Possibly as a result of this agreement, Ukrainian language students rose sharply in number. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the twentieth century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half, and an eastern, Ukrainian half. Starting with the election of September 1895, Galicia became known for its &quot;bloody elections&quot; as the Austrian prime minister Count Kasimir Felix Badeni proceeded to rig the election results while having policemen beat those voters were not voting for the government at the poll stations.


===The Great Economic Emigration===

Beginning in the 1880s, a mass emigration of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the United States, Brazil, and Canada.

Caused by the backward economic condition of Galicia where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ruthenians/Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Western Podolia around Ternopil to Western Canada; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary. The vast majority of the Ukrainians and Poles who went to Canada prior to 1914 came from either Galicia or the neighboring Bukovina province of the Austrian empire. In 1847, 1849, 1855, 1865, 1876 and 1889, there were famines in Galicia that led to thousands starving to death, which increased the sense that life in Galicia was hopeless and inspired people to leave in search of a better life in the New World. Adding to the exodus were the inheritance laws in Galicia adopted in 1868 which stated that the land should be equally divided amongst the sons of a peasant, which‚Äîowing to the tendency of Galician peasants to have large families‚Äîled to the land being divided into so many small holdings as to make farming uneconomical.

A total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to emigration which never again reached the same proportions. The Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil, the &quot;Brazilian Fever&quot; as it was called at the time, was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet Maria Konopnicka, the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko, and many others. Some states in south of Brazil have a large percentage of their population formed by direct descendants of these Ruthenian/Ukrainian immigrants.

When it comes to social relations, most especially between peasants and landlords, the area was the most undeveloped in the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Galician peasantry was always living at the verge of starvation. This led the Polish peasants to ironically refer to the province as &quot;Golicja i G≈Çodomeria&quot; i.e &quot;(the place of) Bareness and Starvation&quot;. Tsar Alexander II had officially banned serfdom and liberated the serfs in the Russian Empire in the 1870s and enacted legislation to protect the serfs. But in Galicia the serfs could be coerced or forced through predatory practices back into serfdom by the affluent Polish merchant class and local nobility, a condition which lasted until the start of World War I.

At the time of these emigrations in the 1890s, many Polish and Ukrainian liberals saw Galicia as a Polish Piedmont or a Ukrainian Piedmont. Because Italians had started their liberation from Austrian rule in the Italian Piedmont these Ukrainian and Polish nationalists felt that the liberation of their two countries would begin in Galicia.
In spite of almost 750,000 persons emigrating across the Atlantic from 1880 to 1914 Galicia&#x27;s population increased by 45% between 1869 and 1910.

===First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict===
During the First World War, Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the Central Powers. The Imperial Russian Army overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian Army in a chaotic frontier battle in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive.

In late 1918 Eastern Galicia became a part of the restored Republic of Poland, which absorbed the Lemko-Rusyn Republic. The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. During the Polish-Soviet War the Soviets tried to establish the puppet-state of the Galician SSR in East Galicia, the government of which after a couple of months was liquidated.

The fate of Galicia was settled by the Peace of Riga on March 18, 1921, giving all of Galicia to the Second Polish Republic. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923. The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil resources in the Borys≈Çaw-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to pour into the Galician oil industry. The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War, and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, would be able to administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assets.

The Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of Volhynia made up about 12% of the population of the Second Polish Republic, and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.

==Administrative divisions==
Prior to the First Partition of Poland which established the kingdom, the region had been divided into Voivodeships (historically also &#x27;palatinates&#x27;). Specifically, the area that became Galicia and Lodomeria comprised most of the Ruthenian (with the Land of Halicz), Be≈Çz and Krak√≥w Voivodeships and smaller parts of the Podolian, Lublin and Sandomierz Voivodeships.

Soon after the partition the newly acquired Polish territories were organised into six (). They were subdivided in November 1773 into 59 (&#x27;circle districts&#x27;); this was reduced to 19 in 1777.

=== Standard (1782‚Äì1850; 1854‚Äì1867) ===
In 1782 the two-level system was abolished and the Kingdom was divided into 18 standard ( ; , ; , ), much like the other (non-Hungarian) Habsburg realms. This system remained in place (except 1850‚Äì53) until they were finally abolished in 1867.

In 1786 Bukovina ‚Äì the former northwestern part of Moldavia which had been occupied by Russia in 1769 (during the Russo-Turkish War) and ceded to the Habsburg monarchy in 1774 as a &quot;token of appreciation&quot; ‚Äì became part of Galicia as the . (Prior to that it had been administered as a military district.)

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 the three western-most ‚Äì , and ‚Äì were transferred to West Galicia (see below). The became the . West Galicia was merged with Galicia-proper in 1803.

In the 1809 Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn which ended the War of the Fifth Coalition, Austria was forced to cede the (Zamo≈õƒá), along with all of its third partition gains, to the Duchy of Warsaw; these became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland in 1815, apart from Krak√≥w (part of West Galicia) which became the Free City of Cracow. Austria was also forced to cede the and most of the to Russia, which collectively became the ; the rump of was merged with part of the to form the . When the was returned to Austria in 1815 the two parts were re-separated; the former became the .

In 1846 Austria annexed the Free City of Cracow and it became the Grand Duchy of Krak√≥w. Administratively this was treated as the Galician .

In 1850 the were briefly replaced with and (see below), but these reforms were reversed in 1853, with the exact administrative structure to be determined. In 1854 the were formally re-established, sub-divided into and grouped into two (&#x27;administrative regions/territories&#x27;) ‚Äì (Lviv/Lw√≥w) and (Kraw√≥w). and were themselves statutory cities subordinate directly to the Kingdom.

=== and political districts (1850‚Äì53) ===

In 1850 Galicia and Lodomeria was divided into three (&#x27;government districts&#x27;), named after their capitals: (Lviv/Lw√≥w), (Kraw√≥w) and (Stanislaviv/Stanis≈Çaw√≥w; today called Ivano-Frankivsk). The were abolished and replaced with political districts (), of which they had 19, 26 and 18 respectively (giving a total of 63).

The and political districts abolished in 1853 and the formally reinstated in 1854 (see above).

=== Political Districts (1867‚Äì1918) ===

In 1867 the Kingdom was once again split into numerous political districts (), called (counties) in Polish, of which there were originally 74. In 1914 they numbered 82. Besides Lviv (Lw√≥w in Polish) being the capital of the Kingdom, Krak√≥w was considered as the unofficial capital of the western part of Galicia and the second most important city in the region.

===Other administrative entities===

====West Galicia====
West Galicia was part of the Kingdom from 1795 to 1809, until 1803 as a separate administrative unit. As with the rest of Galicia it was divided into :
==== Bukovina District ====

Bukovina was part of the Kingdom from 1775 to 1849 (after 1849: Duchy of Bukovina).

==== Free City of Cracow ====
The Free City of Cracow was a co-protectorate with Prussia and Russia from 1815 to 1846. It was annexed by Austria in 1846 as the Grand Duchy of Krak√≥w and became &quot;de facto&quot; part of the Kingdom.

==Government==
After the partition of Poland the region was governed by an appointed governor, later a vice-regent. During the war time the office of vice-regent was supplemented by a military-governor. In 1861 a regional assembly was established, the Sejm of the Land, which initially due to lack of adequate administrative building was located in the building of the Skarbek Theatre until 1890.

===Vice-Regents===

List of vice-regents since 1900:

==Demographics==

In 1773, Galicia had about 2.6 million inhabitants in 280 cities and markets and approx. 5,500 villages. There were nearly 19,000 noble families with 95,000 members (about 3% of the population). The &quot;non-free&quot; accounted for 1.86 million, more than 70% of the population. A small number were full farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.

No country of the Austrian monarchy had such a varied ethnic mix as Galicia: Poles, Ruthenians, Germans (Galician Germans), Armenians, Jews, Hungarians, Romani people, Lipowaner, etc. The Poles were mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) predominant in the eastern region (Ruthenia).

The Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany and mostly spoke Yiddish as their first language. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to as &quot;Saxons&quot; or &quot;Swabians&quot;, even though most of them did not come from Saxony or Swabia (cf. Transylvanian Saxons and Danube Swabians). There were also some Mennonites who mostly came originally from Switzerland, but spoke a dialect of Palatine German which is close to Pennsylvania German. With inhabitants who had a clear difference in language such as with the Saxons or the Roma identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualness blurred the borders again.

It is however possible to make a clear distinction in religious denominations: the majority of the Poles were Latin Catholics, while the Ruthenians were mostly Greek Catholics (formerly part of the Metropolis of Kiev, Galicia and all Ruthenia in the Ruthenian Uniate Church. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly traditional in their religious observance which later developed into Orthodox Judaism. The Jewish community had a strong sense of Galician identity and called themselves to distinguish themselves from the other Ashkenazi communities of Eastern Europe. The Jewish community of Galicia was largely Orthodox or Hasidic in 1772 and many regarded the reforms introduced by the Emperor Joseph II such as the introduction of conscription as a form of oppression, leading the to split between the Orthodox and Hasidic communities committed to the traditional values vs. the &quot;modernizers&quot; who wanted to change.

The average life expectancy was 27 years for men and 28.5 years for women, as compared to 33 and 37 in Bohemia, 39 and 41 in France and 40 and 42 in England. Also the quality of life was much lower as Galicia was the poorest province in the Austrian empire. The yearly consumption of meat did not exceed per capita, as compared to in Hungary and 33 in Germany. This was mostly due to much lower average income. In 2014, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported: &quot;Poverty in Galicia in the 19th century was so extreme that it had become proverbial‚Äîthe region was called Golicja and Glodomeria, a play on the official name (Galicja i Lodomeria) and &quot;goly&quot; (naked) and &quot;glodny&quot; (hungry).&quot;

In 1888 Galicia extended over and had a population of about 6.4 million people, including 4.8 million peasants (75% of the whole population). The population density, at 81 people per square kilometre, was higher than that of France (71 inhabitants/km2) or Germany. The population rose to 7.3 million in 1900 and to 8 million in 1910.

==Economy==
Galicia was economically the least developed part of Austria and received considerable transfer payments from the Vienna government. Its level of development was comparable to or higher than that of Russia and the Balkans, but well behind Western Europe.

The first detailed description of the economic situation of the region was prepared by Stanislaw Szczepanowski (1846‚Äì1900), a Polish lawyer, economist and chemist who in 1873 published the first version of his report titled (&quot;The Galician Poverty in Numbers&quot;). Based on his own experience as a worker in the India Office, as well as his work on development of the oil industry in the region of Boryslav and the official census data published by the Austro-Hungarian government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.

Statistics indicate the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The average income per capita did not exceed 53 Rhine guilders (RG), as compared to 91 RG in the Kingdom of Poland, 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (c. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than in other parts of the Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in Lower Austria. Despite high taxation, the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.

All in all, the region was used by the Austro-Hungarian government mostly as a reservoir of cheap workforce and recruits for the army, as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in Przemy≈õl, Krak√≥w and other cities. Industrial development was mostly connected to the private oil industry started by Robert Doms and to the Wieliczka salt mines, operational since at least the Middle Ages.

===Industry===
In 1880, industry in Galicia was at a low level. In 1857 Galicia had 102,189 persons or 2.2% of the population worked in industry. By 1870 that number had risen to 179,626, or 3.3% of the population.

===Oil and natural gas industry===
Near Drohobych and Boryslav in Galicia, significant oil reserves were discovered and developed during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The first European attempt to drill for oil was in B√≥brka in western Galicia in 1854. By 1867, a well at Kleczany, in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters. On December 31, 1872, a railway line linking Borys≈Çaw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened. American John Simon Bergheim and Canadian William Henry McGarvey came to Galicia in 1882. In 1883, their company, MacGarvey and Bergheim, bored holes of 700 to 1,000 meters and found large oil deposits. In 1885, they renamed their oil developing enterprise the &quot;Galician-Karpathian Petroleum Company&quot; (), headquartered in Vienna, with McGarvey as the chief administrator and Bergheim as field engineer, and built a huge refinery at Maryampole near Gorlice, in the southeast corner of Galicia. Considered the biggest, most efficient enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole was built in six months and employed 1000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the oil and natural gas industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of petroleum enterprises to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borys≈Çaw of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the &quot;Polish Baku&quot;, the oil fields of Borys≈Çaw and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austria-Hungary Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borys≈Çaw had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. In 1909, Polmin with headquarters in Lviv was established for the extraction and distribution of natural gas. At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkans conflicts.

Galicia was the Central Powers&#x27; only major domestic source of oil during the Great War.

==Flag==
Until 1849, Galicia and Lodomeria was a single province with Bukovina and used the blue-red flag (consisting of two horizontal stripes: the upper one was blue, the lower one was red).

In 1849, Bukovina was given an independent status from that of Galicia-Lodomeria and kept the blue-red flag. Galicia was given a new flag consisting of three horizontal stripes being blue, red and yellow.

That flag remained in use until 1890, when Galicia-Lodomeria received a new flag consisting of two horizontal stripes being red and white. It remained in use until the dissolution of the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria in 1918 and is displayed in Str√∂hl&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1898).

==Military==
The Kingdom was divided into three major military districts centered in Krak√≥w, Lviv, and Przemy≈õl. Local military used a specialized language for communication known as Army Slav. One of the major army units was the 1st Army consisting of 1st (Krak√≥w), 5th (Pressburg), and 10th (Przemy≈õl) Corps.

==The memory of Galicia==

In 2014, the Polish historian Jacek Purchla stated that there were two ways of remembering Galicia, namely as an idyllically innocent multi-cultural land, of a simpler and better time compared to the present vs. the Austrian view of Galicia as a (&quot;half-Asia&quot;) as Austrian officials always regarded Galicia as &quot;a barbaric place inhabited by strange people of questionable personal hygiene&quot;. Galicia was always considered in Vienna to be a colony in need of being &quot;civilized&quot;, and as a result, the Austrians never considered Galicia to be a part of Austria proper. Both the Polish and Ukrainian communities of Galicia saw the province as their &quot;Piedmont&quot; where plans for an independent Polish or Ukrainian state were broached, making the memory of Galicia under Austrian rule a central part of Polish and Ukrainian national memories. In 2014, Purchla stated: &quot;The latest proof of the political significance of the Galician heritage has been the contribution of its Ukrainian parts to the success of the Maidan [revolution] this year and last year&quot;. Starting in the late 19th century, about 2 million Galician Jews immigrated to the United States, and amongst the descendants of the in the United States that the memory of Galicia as either a lost paradise or as a backward province to escape from is kept alive. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported: &quot;In Europe, Galicia is a central element of Poles&#x27; national identity and of Ukrainians&#x27; search for a European identity.&quot;

<text>Louis Allen Rawls (December 1, 1933 ‚Äì January 6, 2006) was an American baritone singer. He released 61 albums, sold more than 40 million records, and had numerous charting singles, most notably the song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love like Mine&quot;. He also worked as a film, television, and voice actor. He was a three-time winner of the Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance Grammy Award.

==Early life==
Rawls was born in Chicago on December 1, 1933, and raised by his grandmother in the Ida B. Wells projects on the city&#x27;s South Side. He began singing in the Greater Mount Olive Baptist Church choir at the age of seven and later sang with local groups through which he met Sam Cooke, who was nearly three years older, and Curtis Mayfield.

==Career==
After graduating from Dunbar Vocational High School, he sang briefly with Cooke in the Teenage Kings of Harmony, a gospel group, and then with the Holy Wonders. In 1951, he replaced Cooke in the Highway QC&#x27;s after Cooke departed to join The Soul Stirrers in Los Angeles. Rawls was hired by the Chosen Gospel Singers and moved to Los Angeles, where he joined the Pilgrim Travelers.

In 1955, Rawls enlisted in the United States Army as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. He served in B Co 2/505th Parachute Infantry and made 26 jumps. He left the Army three years later as a Sergeant and rejoined the Pilgrim Travelers (then known as the Travelers). In 1958, while touring the South with the Travelers and Sam Cooke, Rawls was in a car crash. He was pronounced dead before arriving at the hospital, where he stayed in a coma for five and a half days. He spent a year recuperating, and it was several months before his memory returned. He considered the crash a life-changing event.

With Dick Clark as master of ceremonies, Rawls was able to perform at the Hollywood Bowl in 1959. His first two singles were &quot;Love, Love, Love&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; (For Miles)&quot; for Shar-Dee Records, a label owned by Herb Alpert. &quot;In My Little Black Book&quot; and &quot;80 Ways&quot; were released a year later by Candix Records. In 1962 he signed a contract with Capitol Records and sang backing vocals on &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, both written by Cooke. Rawls charted with a cover of &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot; in 1970 (with the title shortened to &quot;Bring It On Home&quot;).

&quot;Stormy Monday&quot;, a jazz album with Les McCann, was released in 1962. The next two Capitol albums (&quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;) sold well and employed Onzy Matthews as musical director and a 17-piece big band. Both albums reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine charts and propelled his career.

Although his 1966 album &quot;Live!&quot; was certified gold, Rawls would not have a star-making hit until he made a soul album, named &quot;Soulin&#x27; &quot;, later that year. The album contained &quot;Love Is a Hurtin&#x27; Thing&quot;, his first R&amp;B No.1 single. In 1967, he won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Dead End Street&quot;. In 1967, he performed at the first evening of the Monterey International Pop Music Festival.

In 1969, Rawls was co-host of NBC&#x27;s summer replacement series for the &quot;Dean Martin Show&quot; with Martin&#x27;s daughter, singer Gail Martin. After leaving Capitol in 1971, he signed with MGM and released the single &quot;Natural Man&quot; written for him by comedian Sandy Baron and singer Bobby Hebb. For Bell Records in 1974 he recorded a cover version of &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot; by Hall &amp; Oates. Two years later with his new manager Martin Pichinson, he signed with Philadelphia International and recorded &quot;All Things in Time&quot;, which sold a million copies. &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine&quot; became his biggest selling single, selling a million copies, topping the R&amp;B and Adult Contemporary charts, and reaching No. 2 on the pop chart. The hit single &quot;Lady Love&quot; followed, from the 1977 album &quot;When You Hear Lou, You&#x27;ve Heard It All&quot;.

===Charity===
In 1980, Rawls began the &quot;Lou Rawls Parade of Stars Telethon&quot; which benefits the United Negro College Fund. The annual event, known since 1998 as &quot;An Evening of Stars: A Celebration of Educational Excellence&quot;, consists of stories of successful black students who have benefited from and/or graduated from one of the many historically black colleges and universities who receive support from the UNCF, along with musical performances from various recording artists in support of the UNCF&#x27;s and Rawls&#x27; efforts. The event had raised over US$250 million for the fund at the time of Rawls&#x27; death in 2006.

===Television and film===
Rawls appeared in a segment aired during the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to sing the alphabet. He dismissed the suggestion to use cue cards for the performance but reversed his decision when he forgot the order of the letters. He was a guest during the second season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

His first acting credit was in the Western television series &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (starring Barbara Stanwyck, along with Lee Majors and Linda Evans). He was also in the season 5 episode &quot;Lifeline&quot; of the television show &quot;Mannix&quot; and the season 6 episode &quot;Return to the Cotton Club&quot; of the show &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. He appeared in the films &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;; &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;; and &quot;Angel, Angel, Down We Go&quot;. He had a role and sang in &quot;Lookin&#x27; Italian&quot; (1994), an independent film about the mafia. He had a supporting role in &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;. He was a guest host on &quot;Jazz Central&quot;, a television program that was broadcast on the BET channel.

For many years, he was a spokesperson for the Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company. He appeared in television and radio commercials in the mid-to-late 1960s for Spur Malt Liquor, a Rainier Brewing Company product in Seattle. He appeared in a number of Budweiser advertisements. Budweiser was a sponsor for the Rawls telethon and UNCF. There was no attempt to avoid the similarity between the title of the 1977 album &quot;When You&#x27;ve Heard Lou, You&#x27;ve Heard It All&quot; and his corporate sponsor&#x27;s slogan &quot;When You Say Bud, You&#x27;ve Said It All&quot;. A track on the 1978 album &quot;Lou Rawls Live&quot; features him singing the commercial slogan. Anheuser-Busch, the brewers of Budweiser, suggested his telethon work to him.

Rawls lent his rich baritone to cartoons, including &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; and &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. For many of the Film Roman &quot;Garfield&quot; specials, Rawls would often compose songs, which he would then sing usually doing a duet with Desiree Goyette, as well as the singing voice of the title character himself.

In the season 2 episode of &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; entitled &quot;Michael&#x27;s Garden&quot;, Lou Rawls himself sings &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine&quot; to Michael Kyle (Damon Wayans) during a colonoscopy.

==Personal life==
Rawls was married three times. His third wife, Nina, a former flight attendant, managed his career during his last two years. They had one son, Aiden Rawls. Rawls was also survived by another son, Lou Rawls Jr. (deceased 2023), two daughters, Louanna Rawls and Kendra Smith (both of Los Angeles), and four grandchildren.

==Death==

In December 2005, it was announced that Rawls was being treated for lung cancer that metastasized to his brain. He died from this illness on January 6, 2006, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

Lou Rawls&#x27;s final television performance occurred during the 2005‚Äì2006 edition of his telethon, honoring Stevie Wonder in September 2005, months before entering the hospital and after having been diagnosed with cancer earlier in the year. He performed &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; and &quot;It Was A Very Good Year&quot; as a tribute to Frank Sinatra.

==Awards and honors==

On the night of September 29, 1977, Rawls performed the national anthem of the United States before the Earnie Shavers-Muhammad Ali title fight at Madison Square Garden. He was invited to sing the anthem many times over the next 28 years. His final performance was in his hometown of Chicago when he was asked to sing the national anthem before the second game of the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros at U.S. Cellular Field.

Rawls won the AMA for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Male Artist in 1979, tied with singer Teddy Pendergrass.

In 1982, Rawls received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On January 19, 1985, he sang &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; at the nationally televised 50th Presidential Inaugural Gala the day before the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan.

In 2021, Rawls was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
Guion Bluford, the first African-American astronaut, brought the Lou Rawls album &quot;When the Night Comes&quot; (Epic, 1983) into space with him. It contained the song &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;. In 1989, he performed vocals for &quot;The Music and Heroes of America&quot; segment in the animated television miniseries &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot;.

In January 2004, Rawls was honored by the United Negro College Fund for his more than 25 years of charity work with the organization. Instead of hosting and performing as he usually did, Rawls was given the seat of honor and celebrated by his performing colleagues, including Stevie Wonder, The O&#x27;Jays, Gerald Levert, and Ashanti.

In 2009, Pathway Entertainment announced its intention to produce a biopic about Rawls&#x27;s life, tentatively titled &quot;Love Is a Hurtin&#x27; Thing: The Lou Rawls Story&quot;, with Rawls&#x27; son, Lou Rawls Jr., writing the screenplay and Isaiah Washington reportedly playing Rawls.

<doc id="612277" wikidata="Q1970058" url="?curid=612277" title="Hitachi HD64180">
<text>The HD64180 is a Z80-based embedded microprocessor developed by Hitachi with an integrated memory management unit (MMU) and on-chip peripherals. It appeared in 1985. The Hitachi HD64180 &quot;Super Z80&quot; was later licensed to Zilog and sold by them as the Z64180 and with some enhancements as the Zilog Z180.

==Overview==
The HD64180 has the following features:

* Execution and bus access clock rates up to 10 MHz.
* Memory Management Unit supporting 512K bytes of memory (one megabyte for the HD64180 packaged in a PLCC)
* I/O space of 64K addresses
* 12 new instructions including 8 bit by 8 bit integer multiply, non-destructive AND and illegal instruction trap vector
* Two channel Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC)
* Programmable wait state generator
* Programmable DRAM refresh
* Two channel Asynchronous Serial Communication Interface (ASCI)
* Two channel 16-bit Programmable Reload Timer (PRT)
* 1-channel Clocked Serial I/O Port (CSI/O)
* Programmable Vectored Interrupt Controller

The HD64180 has a pipelined execution unit which processes most instructions in fewer clock cycles than the Z80. The most improved instruction group comprises the block instructions; for example those such as LDIR, CPIR, INIR and OTDR. This instruction type takes 21 transition states to execute per iteration; on the HD64180 it takes 14 t-states.

The on-chip DMAC makes block memory transfers possible at a rate faster than the LDIR/LDDR instructions. The on-chip generator for wait states makes it possible to access too-slow hardware on a selective basis using a device filter, as is done for the TRS-80 Model 4&#x27;s balky keyboard. The on-chip ASCI makes it possible to implement additional RS-232 serial ports.

The HD64180 will not execute the &quot;undocumented&quot; Z80 instructions, particularly the ones that access the index registers IX and IY as 8-bit halves. The Hitachi CPU treats them as illegal instructions and accordingly executes the &quot;illegal instruction trap&quot; behavior of resetting the PC register to zero, which simulates a cold restart by redirecting execution to the power-up location.

==Usage==
The Micromint SB180, SemiDisk Systems DT42 CP/M computers, and Olivetti CWP 1 and ETV 210s videotypewriters (also running ROM-based CP/M 2.2) were based on the Hitachi HD64180. The XLR8er upgrade board for the TRS-80 Model 4 also used it. On the Victor HC-90 and HC-95 MSX2 computer, the HD64B180 was used for its turbo mode next to the regular Z80.

<text>Ryongch&#x27;≈èn County is a &quot;kun&quot; (county) in North P&#x27;y≈èngan province, North Korea, at the mouth of the Yalu River. The county seat is Ryongch&#x27;≈èn-≈≠p, about from the border with China. The area has a reported population of 27,000 and is a centre of chemical and metalworking production.

==Administrative divisions==
Ryongch&#x27;≈èn county is divided into 1 &quot;≈≠p&quot; (town), 3 &quot;rodongjagu&quot; (workers&#x27; districts) and 19 &quot;ri&quot; (villages):
==Transport==
The P&#x27;y≈èng≈≠i line of the Korean State Railway, running between China and P&#x27;y≈èngyang runs through Ryongch≈èn and is served by several stations, including in Ryongch&#x27;≈èn-≈≠p. It is the busiest line in the country, crossing the border in nearby Sin≈≠iju, North Korea to Dandong, China.

===Ryongch&#x27;≈èn disaster===
On 22 April 2004, the town suffered a major disaster when a flammable cargo exploded at the town&#x27;s railway station, causing many deaths and much destruction, known as the Ryongch&#x27;≈èn disaster.

==Protests==
In February 2011, the area and others in North P&#x27;y≈èngan had rare protests, of a few score of people, calling for adequate provision of rice and power. At the time, news of the Arab Spring was spreading via Chinese TV channels and phone calls with defectors.

<doc id="612282" wikidata="Q1366957" url="?curid=612282" title="Osvaldo Soriano">
<text>Osvaldo Soriano (January 6, 1943 ‚Äì January 29, 1997) was an Argentine journalist and writer.

==Biography==
Soriano was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. He became a staff writer at &quot;La Opini√≥n&quot; right from the start in 1971 when editor Jacobo Timerman founded the newspaper. &quot;La Opini√≥n&quot; was permeated with progressive politics, and soon there was an attempt to squash the left-wing influence within the paper. After six months of not having any of his articles published, Soriano began writing a story in which a character named &quot;Osvaldo Soriano&quot; reconstructs the life of English actor Stan Laurel.

The work became his first novel, &quot;Triste, solitario y final&quot; (&quot;Sad, lonely and final&quot;), a melancholic parody set in Los Angeles with the famed fictional Philip Marlowe detective as his joint investigator. It was some months after the publication of his novel that he visited the American city, and actually stood by the grave of Stan Laurel, leaving there a copy of his book. This book set the tone for many of his other works: the use of true facts as the background of his stories, the contradictory and tortured nature of the main characters, progressive politics as key element of the stories.

Shortly after the Proceso de Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional &quot;coup d&#x27;√©tat&quot; in Argentina in 1976, he was compelled to move tout of fear for his physical safety first to Brussels, (where he met his wife Catherine), and then to Paris, where he lived in exile until 1984. While in France he befriended Julio Cort√°zar, with whom he founded the short-lived experience of the monthly magazine &quot;Sin censura.&quot; After the fall of the military junta, he returned to Buenos Aires, and the publication of his books were met with large success, not only in South America but also in Italy and several other countries where his works begun to be translated and published.

In his books, Soriano succeeded in mixing his experiences as a democratic activist and as a strong critic of the violence wielded by reactionary governments with extraordinary humor. A lover of both f√∫tbol (soccer) and cinematography, he often honored both in his work. Soriano was a known San Lorenzo fan, sharing that affiliation with fellow Argentine Pope Francis.

After his death in Buenos Aires in 1997 due to a lung cancer, he was buried in the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires. His work has since been translated into at least fifteen different languages, and has inspired film directors and producers on fiction and documentary works based on his novels and life experience.

<text>The Zilog Z280 is a 16-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog as an enhancement of the Zilog Z80 architecture and integrating improvements from the abandoned Zilog Z800 project. First introduced in July 1987, the Z280 is considered to be a commercial failure.

The Z280 was fabricated in CMOS, added a memory management unit (MMU) to expand the addressing range to 16¬†MB, features for multitasking and multiprocessor and coprocessor configurations, and 256 bytes of on-chip static RAM, configurable as either a cache for instructions and/or data, or as part of the ordinary address space. It has a huge number of new instructions and addressing modes giving a total of over 2000 combinations. It is capable of efficiently handling 32-bit data operations including hardware multiply, divide, and sign extension. It offers Supervisor and User operating modes, and optionally separate address spaces for instructions and data in both modes (four total possible address spaces). Its internal clock signal can be configured to run at 1, 2 or 4 times the external clock&#x27;s speed (e.g. a 12MHz CPU with a 3¬†MHz bus). Unlike the Z80 the Z280 uses a multiplexed arrangement for its address and data buses. More successful extensions of the Z80-architecture include the Hitachi HD64180 in 1986 and Zilog eZ80 in 2001, among others.

The Z280 had many advanced features for its time, most of them never seen again on a Zilog processor:

* On-chip instruction and/or data cache, or on-chip RAM
* Instruction pipelining
* High performance 16-bit Z-BUS interface or 8-bit Z80-compatible bus interface
* Built-in MMU with memory protection
* Ability to determine which register set is in context with instructions JAF and JAR
* Three on-chip 16-bit counter/timers
* Four on-chip DMA channels
* On-chip full duplex UART
* User I/O trap
* Supervisor mode (privileged instructions)
* Illegal instruction trap
* Coprocessor emulation trap
* Burst mode memory access
* Multiprocessor support, with many bus configuration modes
* Support for multiple external coprocessors through an accelerated communication interface
* Multiple I/O pages, which also allows for internal I/O devices without restricting the address range of the I/O ports like on eZ80, or conflicting with existing motherboard devices, like the Z180.
* Stack overflow warning

In the early 1990s, a small number of single-board computers based on the Zilog Z280 were designed and produced by Tilmann Reh, but the CPU was never used in any commercially produced computer.

In 2016, Lamar Owens contacted Tilmann Reh and obtained permission to have a small new run of the CPU280 system PCB&#x27;s created, getting ten boards made and distributed to several beta builders. Wayne Warthen developed a build setup to rebuild the EPROM images and floppy disk images, and set up a page at Github for distribution and development. In spring 2018, another ten boards were made.

<text>In philosophy of perception and epistemology, na√Øve realism (also known as direct realism or perceptual realism) is the idea that the senses provide us with direct awareness of objects as they really are. When referred to as direct realism, na√Øve realism is often contrasted with indirect realism.

According to the na√Øve realist, the objects of perception are not representations of external objects, but are in fact those external objects themselves. The na√Øve realist is typically also a metaphysical realist, holding that these objects continue to obey the laws of physics and retain all of their properties regardless of whether or not there is anyone to observe them. They are composed of matter, occupy space, and have properties, such as size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived correctly. The indirect realist, by contrast, holds that the objects of perception are simply representations of reality based on sensory inputs, and thus adheres to the primary/secondary quality distinction in ascribing properties to external objects.

In addition to indirect realism, na√Øve realism can also be contrasted with some forms of idealism, which claim that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas, and some forms of philosophical skepticism, which say that we cannot trust our senses or prove that we are not radically deceived in our beliefs; that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world.

==Overview==
The na√Øve realist is generally committed to the following views:
* Metaphysical realism: There exists a world of material objects, which exist independently of being perceived, and which have properties such as shape, size, color, mass, and so on independently of being perceived
* Empiricism: Some statements about these objects can be known to be true through sensory experience
* Na√Øve realism: By means of our senses, we perceive the world directly, and pretty much as it is, meaning that our claims to have knowledge of it are justified

Among contemporary analytic philosophers who defended direct realism one might refer to, for example, Hilary Putnam, John McDowell, Galen Strawson, John R. Searle, and John L. Pollock.

Searle, for instance, disputes the popular assumption that &quot;we can only directly perceive our own subjective experiences, but never objects and states of affairs in the world themselves&quot;. According to Searle, it has influenced many thinkers to reject direct realism. But Searle contends that the rejection of direct realism is based on a bad argument: the argument from illusion, which in turn relies on vague assumptions on the nature or existence of &quot;sense data&quot;. Various sense data theories were deconstructed in 1962 by the British philosopher J. L. Austin in a book titled &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;.

Talk of sense data has largely been replaced today by talk of representational perception in a broader sense, and scientific realists typically take perception to be representational and therefore assume that indirect realism is true. But the assumption is philosophical, and arguably little prevents scientific realists from assuming direct realism to be true. In a blog post on &quot;Naive realism and color realism&quot;, Hilary Putnam sums up with the following words: &quot;Being an apple is not a natural kind in physics, but it is in biology, recall. Being complex and of no interest to fundamental physics isn&#x27;t a failure to be &quot;real&quot;. I think green is as real as applehood.&quot;

The direct realist claims that the experience of a sunset, for instance, is the real sunset that we directly experience. The indirect realist claims that our relation to reality is indirect, so the experience of a sunset is a subjective representation of what really is radiation as described by physics. But the direct realist does not deny that the sunset is radiation; the experience has a hierarchical structure, and the radiation is part of what amounts to the direct experience.

Simon Blackburn has argued that whatever positions they may take in books, articles or lectures, naive realism is the view of &quot;philosophers when they are off-duty.&quot;

==History==
For a history of direct realist theories, see &quot;Direct and indirect realism ¬ß History&quot;.

==Scientific realism and na√Øve perceptual realism==
Many philosophers claim that it is incompatible to accept na√Øve realism in the philosophy of perception and scientific realism in the philosophy of science. Scientific realism states that the universe contains just those properties that feature in a scientific description of it, which would mean that secondary qualities like color are not real &quot;per se&quot;, and that all that exists are certain wavelengths which are reflected by physical objects because of their microscopic surface texture.

John Locke notably held that the world only contains the primary qualities that feature in a corpuscularian scientific account of the world, and that secondary qualities are in some sense subjective and depend for their existence upon the presence of some perceiver who can observe the objects.

==Influence in psychology==
Na√Øve realism in philosophy has also inspired work on visual perception in psychology. The leading direct realist theorist in psychology was J. J. Gibson. Other psychologists were heavily influenced by this approach, including William Mace, Claire Michaels, Edward S. Reed, Robert Shaw, and Michael Turvey. More recently, Carol Fowler has promoted a direct realist approach to speech perception.

<doc id="612292" wikidata="Q4820878" url="?curid=612292" title="Augusta, New Jersey">
<text>Augusta is an unincorporated community located within Frankford Township, in Sussex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population for the ZIP Code Tabulation Area 07822 was 887.

Augusta is the home of the New Jersey State Fair and the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show.

Skylands Park, a 4,300-seat ballpark, was home to the New Jersey Cardinals of the New York‚ÄìPenn League from 1993 to 2005, and the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League from 2006 to 2010. The stadium is the home of the Sussex County Miners of the Frontier League, which debuted in the Can-Am League for the 2015 season.

== Geography ==
Augusta is located at 41¬∞8&#x27;42&quot; North, 74¬∞41&#x27;5&quot; West (41.145086, -74.684753).

Augusta lies in the Kittatinny Valley which is part of the Great Appalachian Valley. The Kittatinny Mountains are to the west and the New Jersey Highlands are to the east.

==Geology==

Augusta lies on top of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation, created around 450 million B. C. when a volcanic chain of islands collided with the proto North American Plate. The islands rode over top of the North American Plate creating the valley. The valley was under a shallow sea until geologic pressure forced the shale upwards.

The Wisconsin Glacier covered the valley from 21,000 B.C. to 13,000 B.C. Augusta was covered in three hundred meters of ice. When the ice slowly melted this created the Paulinskill River as well as Papakatkin Creek.

The Paulinskill River, which starts in Newton and flows westerly through Augusta from Lafayette, drains into the Delaware River to the southwest. The Paulinskill is one of the premier fishing streams in the state of New Jersey. Each year, thousands of trout are stocked in the Paulinskill River from the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife.

Papakatkin Creek drains into the Wallkill River to the north. The drainage divide is just north of Route 206 in Augusta. A chain of hills leads Papakatkin Creek to travel east and then north into the Wallkill River.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rock Song is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award, reserved for songwriters, was first presented to English musician Sting in 1992. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award honors new songs (containing both melody and lyrics) or songs &quot;first achieving prominence&quot; during the period of eligibility. Songs containing prominent samples or interpolations are not eligible.

The award goes to the songwriter. If the song contains samples or interpolations of earlier songs, the publisher and the original songwriter(s) can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl and Pat Smear hold the record for the most wins, having won four awards each. Springsteen also holds the record for most nominations with nine. Other winners of multiple awards include the other members of Foo Fighters (Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel and Chris Shiflett) with three wins, and Alanis Morissette and the bands Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2, each with two. Award-winning songs have been performed by American artists more than any other nationality, though they have also been performed by musicians or groups originating from Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. There have been four instances in which one artist or group was nominated for two works in the same year: the group Aerosmith was nominated for both &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; in 1994, Melissa Etheridge received nominations for &quot;Come to My Window&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m the Only One&quot; in 1995, Jakob Dylan of the Wallflowers won for &quot;One Headlight&quot; and was also nominated for &quot;The Difference&quot; in 1998, and U2 was nominated for the songs &quot;Elevation&quot; and &quot;Walk On&quot; in 2002. Chad Smith also received two nominations in 2023, receiving songwriting credits for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Ozzy Osbourne songs nominated. Coldplay holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with four.

<text>Hartshorne is a village and civil parish in the English county of Derbyshire. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,888. It is north of the town of Swadlincote.

The name is pronounced &quot;Harts-horn&quot;; the &quot;sh&quot; is not a digraph, as this is a compound.

==Etymology==
The name of the village is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears in the spelling &quot;Heorteshorne&quot;. This comes from the Old English word (&#x27;hart, adult male red deer&#x27;) in the genitive case, compounded with the word (&#x27;horn&#x27;), and once meant &#x27;hart&#x27;s antler&#x27;. It appears that the name originally denoted not the village itself but the neighbouring hill to the south-east of the village, now called &quot;Horn Hill&quot;, which was thought to resemble a stag&#x27;s antler.

==History==
Hartshorne was mentioned in the Domesday book as belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth ten shillings. It passed to the Ireland family in the 14th century, and subsequently to the family of the Foljambe baronets.

The Rector of Hartshorne, William Dethick, founded a free school for local children in 1626.

In 1800, the owner of the Manor, William Bailey Cant, left it to the lawyer Thomas Erskine, in recognition of his role in the case of John Horne Tooke.

==Amenities==

Local pubs include the Admiral Rodney, named after the 1st Baron Rodney (1719‚Äì1792); the Mill Wheel (with an 18th-century mill wheel measuring in diameter); the Bulls Head; and the Greyhound. &quot;he Chesterfield Arms was demolished in September 2009. The Snooty Fox (formerly the Dominoes) was demolished in 2009. The New Inn closed in the 1960s and was then used as a hairdressing salon before being demolished in 1975 to make a car park extension for the Admiral Rodney.

The Old Manor House in the northern part of the village is a Grade II* listed 17th-century timbered building on Main Street. It was built for one John Benskin in 1629 according to parish rate records. Situated south west of St Peter&#x27;s Church in the southern part of the village, it is distinct from The Manor House (also known as the Old Hall) in the northern part of the village.

==Transport==
The local bus service is the No.2 maintained by Arriva Midlands between Derby and Swadlincote via Melbourne, this was previously a Trent route 168 &amp; Arriva route No.69.

==Notable residents==
*George Stanhope, Dean of Canterbury, was born here in 1660

<doc id="612296" wikidata="Q1002817" url="?curid=612296" title="Llangefni">
<text>; ) is the county town of Anglesey in Wales. At the 2011 census, Llangefni&#x27;s population was 5,116, making it the second-largest town in the county and the largest on the island. The community includes the village of Rhosmeirch.

==Location==
The town is near the centre of Anglesey, and is on the River Cefni, after which it is named. Its attractions include the Oriel Ynys M√¥n museum, which details the history of Anglesey and houses collections of the painters Kyffin Williams and Charles Tunnicliffe. In the west of the town is a large secondary school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni (Llangefni Comprehensive School), and in the north a Victorian parish church, St Cyngar&#x27;s, set in a wooded riverside location called the Dingle. The town was formerly named Llangyngar, Welsh for &quot;St Cyngar&#x27;s church&quot;.

==Commerce, transport and education==

Llangefni is a commercial and farming town in Anglesey and once hosted the largest cattle market on the island. There is a relatively large industrial estate, which included a large chicken processing plant, the largest single industrial operation in the town, until March 2023 when it closed with the loss of 700 jobs. Several other smaller businesses remain.

The town had a station on the Anglesey Central Railway line which opened in 1864. It closed in 1964, although goods trains continued to pass through the town until 1993. Since then, there have been proposals to convert the line into a multi-purpose path at a cost estimated at ¬£10 million pounds. Although no longer usable, the railway tracks have not been removed. The route remains under the control of Network Rail, leased to Anglesey Central Railway (2006) Ltd, which hopes to raise some ¬£150 million to reinstate a working railway. Hybrid plans also exist for a cycle route along of the line (the majority of its length), which would also allow the route to be used for a heritage railway. The nearest station is now at Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, away as the crow flies. There are frequent buses to the larger settlements of Bangor and Holyhead as well as to the smaller towns of Amlwch and Beaumaris. By road the town is just 2 kilometres from the major A55 and A5 roads, via the short A5114. Water for the town comes from Llyn Cefni, a reservoir to the northwest.

Llangefni hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1957 and 1983, and in 1999 gave its name to the Eisteddfod held at the nearby village of Llanbedrgoch. It also hosted the Urdd Eisteddfod (youth Eisteddfod) in 2004. The town also has a college, Coleg Menai (Llangefni site).

Llangefni is home to the headquarters of large builders merchant chain Huws Gray. The company currently has over 100 branches across the UK.

==Sport==
The local association football club, Llangefni Town, was promoted to the Welsh Premier League at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, but relegated one season later.

The local rugby club is Llangefni RFC, which plays in the WRU leagues. The club recently gained promotion to Division 2 West, but the WRU then decided to demote the club back to Division 4 North Wales league.

== Welsh language skills ==
According to the 2011 Census, Llangefni is the community with the highest percentage of Welsh speakers on the Isle of Anglesey, and the 6th highest in Wales. 80.7% of residents aged three and over reported being able to speak Welsh in the 2011 Census, as compared to 83.8% reporting being able to do so in the 2001 Census. 91.6% of those born in Wales could speak Welsh.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Llangefni, at community (town) and county level: Llangefni Town Council and Isle of Anglesey County Council. The town council is based at the former courthouse on Glanhwfa Road.

===Administrative history===
Llangefni was an ancient parish. In 1890 the parish was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Llangefni Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community. District-level functions passed to Ynys M√¥n-Isle of Anglesey Borough Council, which in 1996 was reconstituted as a county council.

The original Anglesey County Council was based at Llangefni Shire Hall from 1899 until 1974. The shire hall was re-designated the &quot;Borough Council Offices&quot; in 1974 and became the headquarters of Ynys M√¥n-Isle of Anglesey Borough Council. New council offices were built on Mill Street () in Llangefni in the late 1990s for the new Isle of Anglesey County Council.

<doc id="612301" wikidata="Q5631397" url="?curid=612301" title="HMS Arethusa (F38)">
<text>HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot; was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy. She was, like most of the &quot;Leander&quot;s, named after a figure of mythology (the exceptions being &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Sirius&quot;). &quot;Arethusa&quot; was built by J.S. White &amp; Company Shipbuilders of Cowes, launched on 5 November 1963 and commissioned on 24 November 1965.

==Operational service==
In 1967, &quot;Arethusa&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean. At the end of 1967 she was docked down for a repair period finishing in the spring of 1968. In the same year she took part in Portsmouth &#x27;Navy Days&#x27;. After re dedication the ship worked up at Portland, later deploying to the Mediterranean. In 1969 &quot;Arethusa&quot; together with , and visited Barbados, transited the Panama Canal and proceeded to Callao in Peru, Valparaiso, the Falkland Islands and Montevideo returning to the UK for Easter.

Later in 1969 &quot;Arethusa&quot; was deployed as West Indies guard ship. Visits included Punta Del Garda, Bermuda, Washington DC, Norfolk Virginia, Key West, Anguilla, Antigua, St Lucia, Cura√ßao, St Kitts, Tortola, St Vincent, Carriacou, Nassau, Freeport Grand Bahama, transiting the Panama Canal again to San Diego and San Francisco; returning via the Panama Canal to Trinidad. She continued to Cartagena, Dominica, St Martin, Bequia, Georgetown, Belize, Fort Lauderdale arriving in Portsmouth in April 1970. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was guard ship for the hand-over of independence to British Guiana.

In 1970, after visits to Lorient and Esbjerg, &quot;Arethusa&quot; deployed to the Far East via South Africa and her first Beira Patrol, While in the Far East she visited Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Nagoya, and the Philippines. On returning to Singapore she helped escort the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on their South East Asian tour. In 1972, &quot;Arethusa&quot; undertook a further Beira Patrol which was designed to prevent oil reaching the landlocked country of Rhodesia via the then-Portuguese colony of Mozambique. The following year, &quot;Arethusa&quot; undertook a fishery protection patrol during the Second Cod War, and during that patrol was rammed by the Icelandic gunboat &quot;√ì√∞inn&quot;.

In 1973 &quot;Arethusa&quot; began her modernisation which included the removal of her one twin 4.5-in gun, with the Ikara anti-submarine warfare missile system taking its place. The modernisation was completed in April 1977. In that same year, &quot;Arethusa&quot;, like many Leanders, took part in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Review in celebration of HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was positioned between and and was part of the 3rd Frigate Squadron. Between 1978 and 1981 she was commanded by Kenneth Snow. In 1979, &quot;Arethusa&quot; deployed to the Far East and Pacific.

In 1980 &quot;Arethusa&quot; underwent a refit that was completed the following year. She then joined Standing Naval Force Atlantic, a NATO multi-national squadron. In 1985, &quot;Arethusa&quot; was fitted with towed array sonar.

==Fate==
Arethusa was decommissioned on 4 April 1989 in Portsmouth. She was later sunk as a target in 1991.

<doc id="612303" wikidata="Q7318778" url="?curid=612303" title="Revolutionary Conservative Caucus">
<text>The Revolutionary Conservative Caucus was a small, right-wing pressure group which attempted to introduce a new radicalism into British conservatism.

It was founded in November 1992 by Stuart Millson, an officer of the Western Goals Institute, and Jonathan Bowden; members included Mark Cotterill, Tom Acton and Steve Brady formerly of the National Front and Derek Turner. Millson&#x27;s close friend from the Monday Club, Gregory Lauder-Frost, acknowledged he was a &quot;supporter&quot; in a letter published in one of their journals.

==Influence==
It met limited success in its short existence of just over two years, lacking a substantive membership base. Sir Norman Fowler attacked them, stating in The Sunday Express: &quot;These people are not remotely typical of mainstream Conservatives&quot;, and Jerry Hayes, Conservative Party MP was quoted in the same newspaper as saying &quot;They are a grim bunch&quot;. Labour MEP Glyn Ford went even further by announcing at the 1993 Labour Party Conference: &quot;The Tories have a far-Right tendency...I have passed details of the Revolutionary Conservative Caucus to Special Branch&quot;. However the Conservative MP Rupert Allason was quoted in &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine as saying &quot;If they are against Maastricht, they can&#x27;t be bad.&quot; Although disbanded after Millson and Bowden parted company at the end of 1994, it &quot;managed to redraw a right-wing nationalist agenda&quot; and played a crucial part towards introducing philosophical discussion into far-right politics in Britain and was an influence on the establishment of the magazine &quot;Right Now!&quot; which was edited by Derek Turner.

In its lifetime, the Revolutionary Conservative Caucus published policy papers as well as a magazine entitled &quot;The Revolutionary Conservative&quot;.

<text>Amlwch () is a port town and community in Wales. It is situated on the north coast of the Isle of Anglesey, on the A5025 which connects it to Holyhead and to Menai Bridge. As well as Amlwch town and Amlwch Port, other settlements within the community include Burwen, Bull Bay (Porthllechog) and Pentrefelin. The town has a beach in Llaneilian, and it has significant coastal cliffs. Tourism is an important element of the local economy. At one time it was a booming mining town that became the centre of a vast global trade in copper ore. The harbour inlet became a busy port and significant shipbuilding and ship repair centre, as well as an embarkation point with boats sailing to the Isle of Man and to Liverpool. The community covers an area of about 15 square kilometres.

==Town centre==
The name Amlwch ‚Äì a reference to the site of the town&#x27;s harbour, Porth Amlwch ‚Äì derives from Welsh &quot;am&quot; (&quot;about, on or around&quot;) and &quot;llwch&quot; (an old word meaning &quot;inlet, creek&quot; - similar to the Gaelic word &quot;loch&quot; for a body of water).

On 23 November 1981, the first tornado of the record-breaking 1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak, an F1/T2 tornado, passed through Amlwch.

At the 2011 census the community had a population of 3,789.

It is also home to the local secondary school, Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones which Lemmy attended, and the town also has a primary school.

The local newspaper for northeastern Anglesey is &quot;Yr Arwydd&quot; (&#x27;The Sign&#x27;). &quot;Yr Arwydd&quot; is the local Welsh name for Mynydd Bodafon, the paper covers the area surrounding the mountain, and has an image of the summit as its logo.

===Industry===
Amlwch grew rapidly in the 18th century near what was then the world&#x27;s biggest copper mine at the nearby Parys Mountain. By the late 18th century, Amlwch had a population of around 10,000 and was the second largest town in Wales after Merthyr Tydfil. It was at this time that its harbour was also extended to accommodate the ships needed to transport the ore.

When the copper production declined, a wide variety of industrial activities were developed to take its place. Ship-building in the narrow harbour area and other sites around the coast of Amlwch Port was a significant enterprise from the 1820s and grew in significance after the railway opened in 1864, reducing the use of the harbour for copper and other goods by ship. By 1912 the main shipbuilding activities were in decline, and neither the harbour nor shipyards offered much commercial activity.

In 1953 Octel began the extraction of bromine from seawater at a plant built just west of the port. The bromine was taken to Ellesmere Port where it was used in the manufacture of anti-knock additives for leaded petrol. When leaded petrol was withdrawwn in 2000 the demand for bromine fell. The plant ceased production in 2004. 

In the 1970s, Amlwch had an offshore single point mooring - Amlwch Oil Terminal - which was used to receive large oil tankers which were unsuitable for the Mersey. Reception tanks were located ashore and the oil was pumped from there to the refineries on the Manchester Ship Canal. The terminal closed in 1990.

When copper mining began to decline in the mid-1850s, shipbuilding became the main industry with many people also becoming involved in the ship repair and other maritime industries. The town was home to a brewing industry and also had tobacco works, producing the famous Amlwch Shag Tobacco - &quot;Baco Shag Amlwch&quot;.

===Railway===
Amlwch station was the northern terminus of the Anglesey Central Railway which was opened in 1864. It closed to passengers a hundred years later, in 1964, but for the next 30 years was used by freight trains. In 1951 the Amlwch Octel bromide works installed an extension to the line from Amlwch station into their premises. After the passenger service ceased the line continued until 1993 with freight trains bringing sulphuric acid in to the Octel works, and transporting bromine and related products used in fuel additives, back to the main line, bound for Ellesmere Port.

In 1993 the freight activity was all transferred to road vehicles, and use of the line ceased. The rails were not lifted however, leaving open the prospect that the line could be restored as a tourist and local transport facility for Amlwch, Llanerchymedd and Llangefni. In 2012 a local enthusiast group, Anglesey Central Railway, or &quot;Lein Amlwch&quot;, were granted permission to clear and survey the line condition, and in May 2017 the Welsh Government announced that re-opening Llangefni station was under active consideration, raising a strong hope that the service could one day continue north to reach Amlwch again.

===Tourism===
Attractions in Amlwch include its restored port area, the Anglesey Coastal Path which passes through it, its watch tower containing an exhibition by Geo M√¥n, maritime and copper mining museums, St Eleth&#x27;s Church (which dates from 1800) and the reinforced concrete Catholic church Our Lady Star of the Sea and St Winefride, built in 1937.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Amlwch, at community (town) and county level: Amlwch Town Council and Isle of Anglesey County Council. The town council is based at the old police station on L√¥n Goch and comprises fifteen councillors elected from the three community wards of Town, Rural and Amlwch Port. Amlwch is in the Twrcelyn electoral ward which also includes Llanbadrig, Llaneilian and Rhosybol, electing three county councillors to the county council.

===Administrative history===
Amlwch was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, Amlwch was given a parish council and included in the Twrcelyn Rural District. In 1901 the parish was converted into an urban district. Amlwch Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community. District-level functions passed to Ynys M√¥n-Isle of Anglesey Borough Council, which in 1996 was reconstituted as a county council.

==Sport and leisure==
The town&#x27;s leisure centre is one of the few on Anglesey and has a swimming pool, sports centre. It is situated on Anglesey&#x27;s 125-mile stretch of coast that is designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The town also has two football clubs, Amlwch Town F.C., who play in the Welsh Alliance League, and Amlwch Port F.C., a Sunday League pub team that plays in the North Wales Sunday League.

Amlwch has a sea rowing club based in Bull Bay, Trireme Ynys Mon Rowing Club.

<doc id="612310" wikidata="Q5481042" url="?curid=612310" title="Francis Garc√≠a">
<text>Francis Garc√≠a (born Jos√© Francisco Garc√≠a Escalante; 6 April 1958 ‚Äì 10 October 2007), known by the artistic name &quot;Francis&quot;, was a Mexican entertainer who was a famous actress, vedette and stage costume designer.

== Career ==
Born in Campeche, Campeche as Francisco Garcia Escalante, she first gained attention as a dancer in vedette shows, held at the famous &quot;Blanquita&quot; theater, some of which included a transvestites&#x27; ballet. 

Her first mainstream breakthrough was in the said theater during the casting for a movie called &quot;Bellas de noche&quot; (1975) where she was given a role, resulting in her later getting her own show at the Blanquita called &quot;Francis, la fantasia hecha mujer&quot; ( Francis, the fantasy made woman ) which successfully ran for 17 years, she also performed in Los Angeles at the theater &quot;Los Pinos&quot;, which was the home of her touring shows. She was an actress, comedian, singer, lip-syncher and choreographer/dancer.

During her theater and television shows, she impersonated famous Latin female singers such as Colombian Shakira, Spaniard Roc√≠o D√∫rcal and Mexicans Gloria Trevi, Alejandra Guzm√°n, and Lupita D&#x27;Alessio as well as doing stand-up comedy and Vegas-style dancing numbers.

Fashion designer Mitzi, a long-time friend, credits Garcia with helping him during his time of need and aiding in starting his design empire.

She was a beloved public personality in Mexican showbiz and appeared in several movies, telenovelas, variety shows and broadcasts of her theater comedy shows, most notable was her stage persona as a female impersonator during a time when Mexican society was very close-minded and homosexuality was considered a minor crime, she was the first openly gay celebrity in the country and a passionate activist for equality and human and gay rights until her death.
During her lifetime she was relentlessly questioned if she ever wanted to surgically become a woman, which she vehemently denied quoting religious beliefs and jokingly expressing that in today&#x27;s society, she&#x27;d rather get surgery to make her penis bigger, as women are more popular with &quot;something extra&quot; down there...

She never had feminisation surgeries, she did however have rhinoplasty to help her achieve her famed Lupita D&#x27;Alessio characterization which was highly acclaimed.

== Death ==
Garcia died of a lung thrombosis in a Mexico City hospital on 10 October 2007. She was 49 years old.

<doc id="612314" wikidata="Q3405038" url="?curid=612314" title="Cemaes">
<text>Cemaes () is a village on the north coast of Anglesey in Wales, sited on Cemaes Bay, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty which is partly owned by the National Trust. It is the most northerly village in Wales (excluding the nearby hamlet of Llanbadrig). The name Cemaes derives from the Welsh word &quot;cemais&quot;, meaning &quot;bend or loop in a river, inlet of sea, bay&quot;. In 2011 the population of Cemaes in Llanbadrig community was 1,357. The most northerly point in Wales, Ynys Badrig, is nearby.

Cemaes is a fishing port and tourist resort, and is known for its beach. It has a sheltered natural harbour that looks north to the Irish Sea and is the site of an ancient settlement. Cemaes also has a wind farm and at nearby Wylfa is a nuclear power station. The river in the village is the River Wygyr, which flows from just below Parys Mountain to the sea at Cemaes. It is joined along the way by the Afon Meddanen on Carrog Farm, Carrog. The name Wygyr is Welsh and may mean &quot;green wood&quot; (&quot;(g)wig&quot; + &quot;ir&quot;) or perhaps &#x27;where two rivers meet&#x27;.

Since the Victorian era the picturesque character of Cemaes and the natural beauty of the island have attracted many artists and tourists. Lloyd George used to visit here. Cemaes is located on the Anglesey Coastal Path and is popular with walkers.

The village football team, Cemaes Bay F.C., play in the Welsh Alliance League, but previously have played in the League of Wales, being the first team on Anglesey to do so.

==History==
The village was a commotal seat for the Prince of Wales before the invasion of Edward I in 1282‚Äì83. Dafydd ap Llywelyn, prince of Wales from 1240 to 1246, is recorded as having issued an act at Cemaes in 1238.

Between the end of the 18th and beginning of the 20th century the village was noted for producing salted herring as well as bricks from a nearby works, which was served by a narrow gauge tramway down to the sea. The pier, which was badly needed for trade and fishing, and later tourism, was damaged badly by storms in 1828 and 1889. Both times they were rebuilt and improved by local businessmen.

Throughout its history the village has had three names. The first was Castell Iorwerth (&quot;Iorwerth&#x27;s Castle&quot;) after an important Welsh prince of the time. The second name, Cemais, is similar to the modern name and refers to the meanders in the River Wygyr that are near the village. The name of the nearby Wylfa nuclear power station is linked to the village. The late 19th-century Cemaes resident David Hughes, who travelled to Liverpool and found riches in the building industry, lived for much of his life on the island. He built the village hall in 1898 and his home &#x27;Wylfa Manor&#x27; in 1896, on the site of the current power station. It is located under the current Wylfa car park.

The village hosted several matches of the 2019 Inter Games Football Tournament, a replacement football tournament for the popular Island Games. The games were held in Gibraltar but the lack of pitches there meant Anglesey was deemed to be a better host.

==Cemaes Heritage Centre==

The centre forms a permanent exhibition, tea room/coffee shop and a meeting and training room. It features a brand new heritage experience, in which one can learn about the bygone era of Cemaes and the parish of Llanbadrig, from Stone Age nomads, and the area&#x27;s connection to the native Welsh Princes, to Cemaes&#x27; more recent maritime and industrial heritage. It retells the life stories of some of Cemaes&#x27; most interesting and most notable characters ‚Äì &#x27;Portraits of Cemaes&#x27; ‚Äì and displays a permanent art collection reflecting how artists were inspired by Cemaes&#x27; landscape and rich heritage.

==Llanbadrig Church==
Those who make the pilgrimage from Cemaes to the headland to the east, where the church stands, will be rewarded by both the history of the church and views on a clear day to the Isle of Man, the hills of the Lake District and the Mountains of Mourne in Ireland. The Welsh name Llanbadrig means &quot;church of St Patrick&quot;. There are three churches in Wales dedicated to St Patrick, although Llanbadrig church, founded in AD 440, is probably the only one with a direct link to the patron saint of Ireland. We know that Patrick, then Bishop, was sent by Pope Celestine I to Ireland to convert the Irish to Christianity during the 5th century. Local legend insists that Patrick was shipwrecked on Ynys Badrig (Patrick&#x27;s Island, which is also called Middle Mouse because of its shape). This island can be seen from the stile in the churchyard wall. He succeeded in crossing to Anglesey, landing at Rhos Badrig (Patrick&#x27;s Moor) and finding refuge in Ogof Badrig (Patrick&#x27;s Cave). This cave, below the churchyard, has a freshwater well, Ffynnon Badrig (Patrick&#x27;s Well), but rockfalls have made the well inaccessible. Legend states that this fresh water allowed Bishop Patrick to recover from his ordeal and he founded the church in thanks to God. Opening hours are limited to 10am‚Äì5pm May to September, and a monthly service of Evensong is held at 2pm on the first Sunday of the month during summer.

==Geology==
The rocks exposed by coastal erosion in North Anglesey belong mainly to what geologists call the Mona Complex, which is among the oldest rock units seen in Wales. It underlies, and is therefore older than, the slates of the North Wales quarrying industry, but is probably not very much older in geological terms. Since the remains of fossilized remains have been found in the rocks, it does not pre-date the origins of life and is therefore probably about 600 million years old.

The locality is well known to geologists following the enthusiastic description by Edward Greenly, in his pioneering book on the geology of Anglesey dated 1919: ‚Äòa many coloured m√©lange that is really indescribable, and must therefore be seen in the field to be envisaged‚Äô.

==Wildlife==
Cemaes has a range of wildlife from foxes and peregrine falcons to marine life. On Wylfa Head, you can see porpoises coming up for air. Cemaes harbour is a good spot for fishing, as you can catch Atlantic mackerel, flatfish, red crabs and other fish and crustaceans. Near Cemaes is Cemlyn, which hosts the only breeding Sandwich terns in Wales.

==Wales in Bloom==
Cemaes Bay through the hard work of local volunteers has won the &#x27;Wales in Bloom&#x27; village category on a number of occasions, the last being 2008.

<doc id="612330" wikidata="Q183718" url="?curid=612330" title="Last.fm">
<text>Last.fm is a music website founded in the United Kingdom in 2002. Utilizing a music recommender system known as &quot;Audioscrobbler,&quot; Last.fm creates a detailed profile of each user&#x27;s musical preferences by recording the details of the tracks they listen to, whether from Internet radio stations or from the user&#x27;s computer or portable music devices. This information is transferred (&quot;scrobbled&quot;) to Last.fm&#x27;s database via the music player (including, among others, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, MusicBee, SoundCloud, and Anghami) or through a plug-in installed in the user&#x27;s music player. The data is then displayed on the user&#x27;s profile page and compiled to create reference pages for individual artists.

On 30 May 2007, it was acquired by CBS Corporation through its streaming division CBS Interactive, which is now part of Paramount Global, for ¬£140 million (US$280 million, ).

The site previously offered a radio streaming service, which was discontinued on 28 April 2014. The ability to access the extensive catalogue of music stored on the site was later removed entirely and replaced by links to YouTube and Spotify where available.

==History== 
The current Last.fm website was developed from two separate sources, &quot;Last.fm&quot; and &quot;Audioscrobbler,&quot; which were merged in 2005. Audioscrobbler began as a computer science project by Richard Jones while he was attending the University of Southampton School of Electronics and Computer Science in the United Kingdom. The term &quot;scrobbling&quot; is defined as the process of finding, processing, and distributing information related to people, music, and other data. Jones developed the first plugins and subsequently opened an API to the community, which led to support for many music players across different operating system platforms. Audioscrobbler was initially limited to tracking which songs its users played on registered computers, enabling charting and collaborative filtering.

===Audioscrobbler and Last.fm (2002‚Äì2006)=== 
Last.fm was founded in 2002 by Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel, Michael Breidenbruecker, and Thomas Willomitzer, all hailing from Germany or Austria. Initially established as an Internet radio station and music community site, it utilized similar music profiles to generate dynamic playlists. The site‚Äôs name employs a domain hack using .fm, the top level domain of Micronesia, which is popular among FM radio-related sites. The &quot;love&quot; and &quot;ban&quot; buttons enabled users to gradually customize their profiles. Last.fm won the Europrix in 2002 and was nominated for the Prix Ars Electronica in 2003. 

The Audioscrobbler and Last.fm teams began collaborating closely, moving into the same offices in Whitechapel, London. By 2003, Last.fm was fully integrated with Audioscrobbler profiles, allowing input through either an Audioscrobbler plugin or a Last.fm station. The sites also shared numerous community forums, although some were unique to each site. The original Audioscrobbler site at the audioscrobbler.com domain name was entirely merged into the new Last.fm site on 9 August 2005. Subsequently, Audioscrobbler.net was launched as a separate development-oriented site on 5 September 2005. At the bottom of each Last.fm page, there was an Audioscrobbler &quot;slogan&quot; that changed each time the page was refreshed. Based on well-known sayings or advertisements, these slogans originally appeared at the top of the Audioscrobbler website pages and were created and contributed by the original site members.
An update to the site was implemented on 14 July 2006, which introduced a new software application for playing Last.fm radio streams and logging tracks played with other media players. Other changes included improvements to the friends system, updating it to require a two-way friendship, the addition of the Last.fm &quot;Dashboard&quot; where users can view relevant information for their profiles on a single page, expanded options for purchasing music from online retailers, and a new visual design for the website (including an optional black colour scheme). 

The site began expanding its language offerings on 15 July 2006, starting with a Japanese version. Currently, the site is available in German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Turkish, and Simplified Chinese. In late 2006, Last.fm won the award for Best Community Music Site at the BT Digital Music Awards held in October. Last.fm also partnered with EMI on the Tuneglue-Audiomap project. In January 2007, Last.fm was nominated for Best Website at the NME Awards.

===CBS acquisition and redesign (2007‚Äì2009)=== 
At the end of April 2007, rumours surfaced regarding negotiations between CBS and Last.fm, indicating that CBS intended to acquire Last.fm for approximately ¬£225 million ($449 million ). In May 2007, it was announced that Channel 4 Radio would broadcast a weekly show called &quot;Worldwide Chart,&quot; reflecting the listening habits of Last.fm users worldwide. On 30 May 2007, it was revealed that Last.fm had been acquired by CBS for ¬£140 million, with Last.fm&#x27;s current management team remaining in place. In July 2008, the &quot;new generation&quot; Last.fm was launched, featuring a completely new layout, color scheme, and several new features, alongside the removal of some old ones. However, this redesign was met with dissatisfaction among some users, who complained about the &quot;unappealing and non-user-friendly layout,&quot; bugs, and slow performance. Nonetheless, a month after the redesign, a CBS press release credited it with generating a 20% increase in the site&#x27;s traffic.

Last.fm debuted Portishead&#x27;s album &quot;Third&quot; on 21 April 2008, a week before its release. It was made available as a free stream on the website, attracting 327,000 listeners in 24 hours. It was the first time Last.fm made an album available before its release.

On 22 February 2009, TechCrunch reported that &quot;[the] RIAA asked social music service Last.fm for data about its users&#x27; listening habits to find individuals with unreleased tracks on their computers. And Last.fm, which is owned by CBS, allegedly handed the data over to the RIAA.&quot; This led to several public statements from both Last.fm and TechCrunch, with Last.fm denying that it had shared any personal data with the RIAA. The request was reportedly prompted by the leak of U2&#x27;s then-unreleased album &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot; and its subsequent widespread distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing services such as BitTorrent.

Three months later, on 22 May 2009, TechCrunch reported that it was CBS, the parent company of Last.fm, that had handed over the data. Last.fm once again denied this allegation, asserting that CBS could not have provided the data without Last.fm&#x27;s knowledge.

===Changes to streaming and access on other platforms (2009‚Äì2011)=== 
On 24 March 2009, Last.fm announced a change in its free streaming policy. According to the blog post, &quot;[...] In the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, nothing will change. In all other countries, listening to Last.fm Radio will soon require a subscription of ‚Ç¨3.00 per month.&quot; This change took effect on 22 April 2009. The announcement sparked a wave of disappointment among users, leading to a decline in data submissions, refusal to update signatures or avatars, and even account deletions.

On 11 September 2009, CBS Radio announced that Last.fm programming would be available for the first time on four major market FM stations through their HD Radio multicasts. This included KCBS-HD2 in Los Angeles, KITS-HD3 in San Francisco, WWFS-HD2 in New York City, and WXRT-HD3 in Chicago. The programming, which primarily featured music aggregated from Last.fm&#x27;s user-generated weekly music charts, as well as live performances and interviews from the Last.fm studios in New York City, debuted on 5 October.

On 12 April 2010, Last.fm announced the removal of the option to preview entire tracks, redirecting users instead to sites such as the free Hype Machine and the pay-to-listen service MOG for this purpose. This decision provoked a significant negative reaction from some members of the Last.fm user community, who perceived the removal as a hindrance to lesser-known and unsigned artists&#x27; ability to gain exposure for their music, as well as to the overall enjoyment of the site. A new &quot;Play direct from artist&quot; feature was introduced shortly thereafter, allowing artists to select individual tracks for users to stream in full.

The ability to listen to custom radio stations, such as &quot;personal tag radio&quot; and &quot;loved tracks radio,&quot; was withdrawn on 17 November 2010. This change provoked an angry response among users. Last.fm stated that the move was due to licensing reasons. The change meant that a tag radio stream would now include all music tagged as such, rather than just that tagged by individual users, effectively broadening the number of tracks that could be streamed under any one tag set.

===Website and desktop application redesigns (2012‚Äì2013)=== 
In March 2012, Last.fm was breached by hackers, resulting in the compromise of more than 43 million user accounts. The full extent of the breach, along with its connection to similar attacks against Tumblr, LinkedIn, and Myspace during the same timeframe, was not confirmed until August 2016. The passwords were encrypted using an outdated, unsalted MD5 hash. Last.fm informed users of the attack in June 2012.

On 14 February 2012, Last.fm announced the launch of a new beta desktop client for public testing. The new scrobbler was subsequently released for all users on 15 January 2013.

On 12 July 2012, Last.fm announced a new website redesign that was open to public beta, inviting feedback from users participating in the testing phase. The redesign officially went live for all users on 2 August 2012. 

While technology websites received the redesign positively, many users expressed dissatisfaction with the changes on the website&#x27;s forum.

On 19 June 2012, Last.fm launched Last.fm Originals, a new website featuring exclusive performances and interviews with various musical artists.

On 13 December 2012, it was announced that Last.fm would discontinue its radio service after January 2013 for subscribers in all countries except the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Additionally, radio in the desktop client would require a subscription in the US, UK, and Germany, although the website radio would remain free in those countries.

===End of radio streaming and redesign (2014‚Äìpresent)=== 
In January 2014, the website announced on-demand integration with Spotify and introduced a new YouTube-powered radio player. With the introduction of the YouTube player, the standard radio service became a subscriber-only feature.

On 26 March 2014, Last.fm announced that it would discontinue its streaming radio service on 28 April 2014. In a statement, the site indicated that the decision was made to &quot;focus on improving scrobbling and recommendations&quot;.

On 15 April 2015, Last.fm released a subscriber-exclusive beta version of a new website redesign. Digital Spy described user reactions on the site&#x27;s forums during the week of the redesign as &quot;universally negative&quot;.

In 2016, Music Manager was discontinued, and music uploaded to the site by musicians and record labels became inaccessible. After the integration with Spotify, these tracks could still be played and downloaded where the option was available; however, following the change, artists themselves were unable to access their songs in the Last.fm catalog.

The website experienced a slight revival during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in 2020, linked to its popularity within music communities on the communication platform Discord. Last.fm celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 2022. Third-party developers have created programs that integrate users&#x27; listening statistical data with Discord, including a popular bot from the Netherlands that has over 400,000 total users.

==Funding and staff== 
Last.fm Ltd is funded through the sale of online advertising space and monthly user subscriptions. 

===Funding prior to CBS acquisition=== 
In 2004, the company received its first round of angel money from Peter Gardner, an investment banker who was introduced to the founders as early as 2002. A second round was led by Stefan Glaenzer, joined by Joi Ito and Reid Hoffman, who also purchased shares from Michael Breidenbruecker. In 2006, the company secured its first round of venture capital funding from European investors Index Ventures, whose General Partners Neil Rimer and Danny Rimer joined Last.fm&#x27;s board of directors, which included Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel, and Stefan Glaenzer (chair).

Original founders Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel, and Richard Jones left the company in the summer of 2009.

==Features== 

===User accounts=== 
The free user account provides access to all the main features listed below. Registered users are also able to send and receive private messages. The newly launched Last.fm Pro user account adds additional features to the free tier, the most notable being the ability to change usernames and gain early access to new features. 

====Profile==== 
A Last.fm user can build a musical profile using any or all of several methods: by listening to their personal music collection on a music player application on a computer or an iPod with an Audioscrobbler plugin, or by listening to the Last.fm Internet radio service, either through the Last.fm client or the embedded player. All songs played are added to a log from which personal top artist/track bar charts and musical recommendations are calculated.

Last.fm automatically generates a profile page for every user, which includes basic information such as their username, avatar, date of registration, and the total number of tracks played. There is also a Shoutbox for public messages. Profile pages are visible to all, along with a list of top artists and tracks, as well as the 10 most recently played tracks (which can be expanded). Each user&#x27;s profile features a &#x27;Taste-o-Meter&#x27; that provides a rating of how compatible the user&#x27;s music taste is. 

====Recommendations==== 
Last.fm includes a personal recommendations page that is only visible to the user and lists suggested new music and events, all tailored to the user&#x27;s preferences. Recommendations are calculated using a collaborative filtering algorithm, allowing users to browse and hear previews of a list of artists not featured on their own profiles but present on those of others with similar musical tastes.

==Artist pages== 

Once an artist has had a track or tracks &quot;scrobbled&quot; by at least one user, Last.fm automatically generates a main artist page. This page displays details such as the total number of plays, the total number of listeners, the most popular weekly and overall tracks, the top weekly listeners, a list of similar artists, the most popular tags, and a shoutbox for messages. Additionally, there are links to events, album and individual track pages, and similar artists radio. Official music videos and other videos imported from YouTube may also be viewed on the relevant artist and track pages. 

Users may contribute relevant biographical details and other information to any artist&#x27;s main page in the form of a wiki. Edits are regularly moderated to prevent vandalism. A photograph of the artist may also be added. If more than one photograph is submitted, the most popular one is chosen by public vote. User-submitted content is licensed for use under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License and the GNU Free Documentation License. 

Last.fm currently cannot disambiguate artists with the same name; a single artist profile is shared between valid artists with identical names. Additionally, Last.fm and its users do not differentiate between the composer and the artist of music, which can lead to confusion in classical music genres.

==Charts== 

One notable feature of Last.fm is the semi-automatic weekly generation and archiving of detailed personal music charts and statistics, which contribute to profile building. Users have access to several different charts, including Top Artists, Top Tracks, and Top Albums. Each of these charts is based on the actual number of listeners for the track, album, or artist, recorded through an Audioscrobbler plugin or the Last.fm radio stream. 

Additionally, charts are available for the top tracks by each artist in the Last.fm system, as well as the top tracks for individual albums (when the tagging information of the audio file is available). Artist profiles also keep track of a short list of Top Fans, calculated using a formula designed to reflect the importance of an artist in a fan&#x27;s profile, balancing users who listen to hundreds of tracks against those who listen to only a few. 

As the information generated is largely compiled from the ID3 data from audio files &quot;scrobbled&quot; from users&#x27; own computers, inaccuracies and misspellings can lead to numerous errors in the listings. Tracks with ambiguous punctuation are particularly prone to separate listings, which can dilute the apparent popularity of a track. Artists or bands with the same name are not always differentiated. The system attempts to consolidate different artist tags into a single artist profile and has recently made efforts to harmonize track names.

===Global charts=== 

Last.fm generates weekly &quot;global&quot; charts of the top 400 artists and tracks listened to by all Last.fm users. 

The results differ significantly from traditional commercial music charts provided by the UK Top 40, &quot;Billboard&quot;, Soundscan, and others, which are based on radio plays or sales. Last.fm charts are less volatile, and a new album&#x27;s release may continue to be reflected in play data for many months or even years after it drops out of commercial charts. For example, The Beatles have consistently ranked among the top five bands on Last.fm, reflecting the enduring popularity of their music regardless of current album sales. Significant events, such as the release of a highly anticipated album or the death of an artist, can have a substantial impact on the charts. 

The Global Tag Chart displays the 100 most popular tags used to describe artists, albums, and tracks. This is based on the total number of times the tag has been applied by Last.fm users since the tagging system was first introduced and does not necessarily reflect the number of users currently listening to any of the related &quot;global tag radio&quot; stations.

==Radio stations== 

Last.fm previously offered customized virtual &quot;radio stations&quot; consisting of uninterrupted audio streams of individual tracks selected from the music files in the music library. This service was discontinued on 28 April 2014. 

Stations could be based on the user&#x27;s personal profile, the user&#x27;s &quot;musical neighbours,&quot; or the user&#x27;s &quot;friends.&quot; Additionally, stations could be created based on tags, provided enough music was associated with the same tag. Users could also create stations on the fly, and each artist page allowed the selection of a &quot;similar artists&quot; or &quot;artist fan&quot; radio station. In May 2009, Last.fm introduced Visual Radio, an enhanced version of Last.fm radio. This update brought features such as an artist slideshow and combo stations, which allowed users to listen to stations consisting of common similar artists or up to three artists or three tags.

Under the terms of the station&#x27;s &quot;radio&quot; license, listeners may not select specific tracks (except as previews) or choose the order in which they are played. However, any of the tracks played may be skipped or banned completely. The appropriate royalties are paid to the copyright holders of all streamed audio tracks in accordance with UK law. The radio stream utilizes an MP3 format encoded at 128 kbit/s and 44.1 kHz, which can be played using the in-page Flash player or the downloaded Last.fm client. Community-supported players are also available, along with a proxy that allows users to utilize a media player of their choice.

On 24 March 2009, Last.fm announced that access to Last.fm Radio would require a subscription of ‚Ç¨3.00 per month for users residing outside the US, UK, and Germany. This change was initially set to take effect on 30 March, but was postponed until 22 April. This decision resulted in over 1,000 comments on the Last.fm blog, most of which were negative.

Streaming and radio services were discontinued by Last.fm on 28 April 2014, allowing the platform to &quot;focus on its core product, the scrobbling experience.&quot; Despite the discontinuation of streaming, the website still generates recommendations based on a user&#x27;s existing library.

===Player===
An &quot;in-page&quot; player is automatically provided for all listeners using an HTML5-enabled browser or with Adobe Flash installed on their computers. However, users must download and install the Last.fm client if they wish to include information about tracks played from their own digital music collection in their personal music profile.

Prior to August 2005, Last.fm generated an open stream that could be played in the user&#x27;s music player of choice, accompanied by a browser-based player control panel. This approach proved challenging to support and has been officially discontinued. The Last.fm client is currently the only officially supported music player for streaming customized Last.fm radio on desktop computers. The current version integrates the music player functions with the plugin that transmits all track data to the Last.fm server, effectively replacing the separate Last.fm Player and standalone track submission plugins. It is also free software licensed under the GNU General Public License and is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

The player allows users to enter the name of any artist or tag, presenting a choice of several similar artist stations or global tag stations. Alternatively, users may play Recommendation radio or any of their personal radio stations without needing to visit the website.

The player displays the name of the currently playing station and track, the song&#x27;s artist, title, and track length, as well as album details, the artist&#x27;s photo and biographical information, album cover art when available, lists of similar artists, the most popular tags, and top fans. Several buttons allow users to &quot;love&quot;, &quot;skip&quot;, or &quot;ban&quot; a song. The &quot;love&quot; button adds the song to the user&#x27;s &quot;loved tracks&quot; list, while the &quot;ban&quot; button ensures that the song will not be played again. Both features affect the user&#x27;s profile, whereas the &quot;skip&quot; button does not. Other buttons enable users to tag or recommend the currently playing track. Additional features offered by the application include minor editing of the user&#x27;s profile, such as removing recently played artists and songs from the loved, banned, or previously played track lists; lists of friends and neighbors; lists of tags; and a list of previously played radio stations. Users can also open their full Last.fm profile page directly from the player.

The client also allows users to install player plugins that integrate with various standalone media players, enabling the submission of tracks played in those programs.

In the latest version of the Last.fm Player application, users can choose to utilize an external player. When this option is selected, the Last.fm Player provides a local URL through which the Last.fm music stream is proxied. Users can then open this URL in their preferred media player.

A new version of the desktop client, which had been in beta since early 2012, was released on 15 January 2013. This version disabled the radio function for free users; a paid subscription is required to access that feature.

Last.fm has also developed client software for mobile phones running the iPhone OS, BlackBerry OS, and the Android OS. These apps have only been released in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, with the company claiming for four years that it is negotiating licenses to make streaming available in other countries.

Last.fm experienced an outage lasting more than 22 hours on 10 June 2014, marking one of the longest interruptions the company has faced. However, the company remained in contact with visitors through a status page.

==Scrobbling== 
In addition to automatically tracking music played via Last.fm&#x27;s radio, users can also contribute (scrobble) listening data to their Last.fm profile from other streaming sites or by tracking music played locally on their personal devices. Scrobbling is feasible with music stored and played locally through software on devices such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and standalone (hardware) media players. In fact, these were the only methods for scrobbling listening data both before and after the launch of the Last.fm radio service. 

Certain sites and media players have built-in capabilities to upload (scrobble) listening data, while for others, users must download and install a plugin for their music player. This plugin automatically submits the artist and title of the song after either half of the song or the first four minutes has played, whichever comes first. If the track is shorter than 30 seconds (31 seconds in iTunes) or lacks metadata (ID3, CDDB, etc.), the track will not be submitted. To accommodate dial-up users or those listening to music while offline, caching of the data and submission in bulk is also possible.

==Other third-party applications==

===Supported applications=== 
;Build Last.fm 
As of March 2008, the website introduced a section titled &quot;Build,&quot; where third-party applications can be submitted for review and subsequently posted to the page.

;SXSW Band-Aid 
Last.fm partnered with the SXSW festival to create an application embedded in the corresponding group page that filters the various artists at the festival based on a user&#x27;s listening statistics. It also utilizes Last.fm&#x27;s recommendation service to suggest other performing artists that the user has not yet listened to.

<doc id="612334" wikidata="Q1486221" url="?curid=612334" title="GNU Parted">
<text>GNU Parted (from &quot;GNU partition editor&quot;) is a free partition editor, used for creating and deleting partitions. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising hard disk usage, copying data between hard disks, and disk imaging. It was written by Andrew Clausen and Lennert Buytenhek.

It consists of a library, libparted, and a command-line front-end, parted, that also serves as a reference implementation.

, GNU Parted runs only under Linux and GNU/Hurd.

==Other front-ends==

===Text-based===

nparted is the newt-based frontend to GNU Parted.

Projects have started for an ncurses frontend, that also could be used in Windows (with GNUWin32 Ncurses).

fatresize offers a command-line interface for FAT16/FAT32 non-destructive resize and uses the GNU Parted library.

tparted is the TV/FV-based frontend for GNU Parted.

===Graphical front-ends===
GParted is a graphical program using the parted libraries. It is adapted for GNOME, one of the two major desktop environments (the other being KDE) for Unix-like installations. It is often included as utility on many live CD distributions to make partitioning easier.

KDE Partition Manager is a Qt graphical program, also included on many live CD distributions, which made use of parted libraries; anyway, in version 4.0 its backend, KPMcore, was ported away from libparted to sfdisk. QtParted was another graphical front-end based on Qt that is no longer being actively maintained.

Pyparted (also called python-parted) is the Python front-end for GNU Parted.

Linux distributions that come with parted by default include Slackware, Knoppix, sidux, SystemRescueCD, and Parted Magic.

==Limitations==
Parted previously had support for operating on filesystems within partitions (creating, moving, resizing, copying). This support was removed in version 3.0.

<doc id="612338" wikidata="Q914316" url="?curid=612338" title="Newborough, Anglesey">
<text>Newborough () is a village in the southern corner of the Isle of Anglesey in Wales. It is a part of the Bro Aberffraw electoral ward; to the northwest is Aberffraw, and to the northeast is Llanfairpwll. There is a church in the village, a primary school, and a public institute. Nearby is the Newborough Warren, a forest, beach, and public nature reserve.

==History==
===Medieval Rhos Vair===
In medieval Gwynedd, Rhosyr was the royal demesne () and seat of governance for the commote of Menai. The location was a residence of the Princes of Gwynedd. There is a ruined court building of Llys Rhosyr (Rhosyr court) on the outskirts of the present village; the royal court () dates from 1237 and was in use for less than a century. The building was the inspiration and model for the reconstruction of a court at St. Fagans Museum, Cardiff.

Newborough gained its current name when the town was founded by citizens of Llanfaes in eastern Anglesey. The inhabitants were evicted during 1294 from east Anglesey to the west of the island by Edward I, in order to promote the new port of Beaumaris. The town was established as a &quot;new borough&quot;, and gained its charter in 1303, before the changes, the town was called &quot;Rh√¥s Vair&quot;. The charter was renewed by successive kings between the 14th and 19th centuries. During that time period, the local landed gentry in the royal borough had appointed an individual to the role of a Burgess, that person was given privileges from the Crown and would negotiate the Royal charter with the King of England in his parliament. Around the year 1489, during the reign of Henry VII of England, the county of Anglesey&#x27;s court sessions (assizes) were moved to the town after 250 years in Beaumaris Castle, thus giving Newborough a member of parliament and making it the county town of Anglesey. Then in 1550, the main court of Anglesey and all related county business was returned to Beaumaris.

===Modern Newborough===
Newborough&#x27;s warren was home to a thriving marram grass industry; this grass was used to produce matting, nets, and rope. In 1814, Newborough&#x27;s status as a Royal chartered borough of King George III was abolished after the resignation of the town mayor. The ending of the town&#x27;s charter affected the people negatively and forced the closure of common land for grazing animals, and the town fell into a state of &quot;severe deprivation&quot;, and the land was taken by the crown. The neighbouring town of Llanddwyn was incorporated into Newborough. During those years, a famous resident was John Morgan, a blind musician who played the crwth in the village. 

==The village today==

===Church===
In the village is St Peter&#x27;s Church. The place of worship dates from the 14th century, with additions in the 15th and 16th centuries. The building was restored in 1850 and extended in 1886.

===School===

In 2019, the village opened a new Welsh-speaking primary school, Ysgol Santes Dwynwen. 

===Prichard Jones institute===

The Prichard Jones Institute was built in 1902‚Äì1905. (&quot;Institute&quot; is a common Welsh term for a community hall: &quot;y stiwt&quot;.) The Neo-Tudor institute with a clock tower was designed by Roland Lloyd Jones and completed for ¬£20,000 (). The Institute appeared on the BBC2 programme, &quot;Restoration&quot;, in 2006. There are six single-storey cottage homes attached to the institute; they were gifted to the village by Sir John Prichard-Jones, after whom the building was named; he was born in . Sir John served as an apprentice draper in Caernarfon, then moved to London to work at Dickins, Smith and Stevens. Pritchard-Jones was eventually appointed as chairman of the Dickins &amp; Jones department store in London, to which he gave his name.

===Recreation===
The village and its environs provide walking opportunities for visitors, including at Newborough Warren, one of the largest areas of dunes in the British Isles, and Newborough Forest, a woodland. Much of the area around Newborough is a nature reserve, popular with those interested in geology, botany, birds, and other wildlife.

There is a large sandy Blue Flag beach at Llanddwyn, which provides access to Ynys Llanddwyn. On the island are the ruins of a church which is said to have been dedicated to the Welsh Saint Dwynwen in the year 465. She was the patron of the Welsh Valentines Day (). The church was built in the 16th century on a mile-long promontory on the beach. The beach is also a popular kitesurfing location.

Just outside the village is Tacla Taid (&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s stuff&quot;), the Anglesey Transport and Agriculture Museum, the largest of its kind in Wales.

===Demographics===
The village is in the Bro Aberffraw electoral ward on Anglesey, the area represents the south-west of the island. Then, Newborough is in the community (and former electoral ward) of Rhosyr, which had a population of 2,169 in 2001, increasing to 2,226 at the 2011 census.

<text>Haploidisation is the process of halving the chromosomal content of a cell, producing a haploid cell. Within the normal reproductive cycle, haploidisation is one of the major functional consequences of meiosis, the other being a process of chromosomal crossover that mingles the genetic content of the parental chromosomes. Usually, haploidisation creates a monoploid cell from a diploid progenitor, or it can involve halving of a polyploid cell, for example to make a diploid potato plant from a tetraploid lineage of potato plants.

If haploidisation is not followed by fertilisation, the result is a haploid lineage of cells. For example, experimental haploidisation may be used to recover a strain of haploid &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; from a diploid strain. It sometimes occurs naturally in plants when meiotically reduced cells (usually egg cells) develop by parthenogenesis.

Haploidisation was one of the procedures used by Japanese researchers to produce Kaguya, a mouse which had same-sex parents; two haploids were then combined to make the diploid mouse. 

Haploidisation commitment is a checkpoint in meiosis which follows the successful completion of premeiotic DNA replication and recombination commitment.

<doc id="612342" wikidata="Q190742" url="?curid=612342" title="Central Council of Jews in Germany">
<text>The Central Council of Jews in Germany (German: &quot;Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland&quot;) is a federation of German Jews. It was founded on 19 July 1950, as a response to the increasing isolation of German Jews by the international Jewish community and increasing interest in Jewish affairs by the (West) German government. Originally based in the Rhenish areas (D√ºsseldorf and Bonn), it transferred its seat to Berlin after the Reunification of Germany (1990). As of 2015 the Jewish community in Germany has around 100,000 registered members, although far more Jews live in the country without belonging to a synagogue. From its early years, the organisation has received strong financial and moral support from the government. Since the end of November 2014, Josef Schuster, an internist from W√ºrzburg, has been president of the Zentralrat. He follows Dieter Graumann, who was the incumbent from November 2010 to November 30th 2014.

The &quot;Zentralrat&quot; is the German affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC).

==History==

In its early years, its leadership was composed of native German Jews (Yekkes), while most of the Jewish community in Germany was made up of Polish-born Jewish Holocaust survivors who had come to Germany as displaced persons, fleeing from the sporadically anti-Zionist and antisemitic communist regime of Poland. Thus, the organisation called itself &quot;Central Council of Jews in Germany&quot; rather than &quot;Central Council of German Jews.&quot; Over time, the Polish-born Jews or their children acculturated to German society and became leaders of the Jewish community. By the late 1980s, the organisation considered changing its name. Since the collapse of the communist regimes of eastern Europe, Germany has experienced a great influx of Russian Jews and other Jews from the former Soviet Union (that collapsed in 1991). Although most of the Jews now living in Germany are recent immigrants, the organisation is dominated by the so-called &quot;German&quot; Jews (who themselves are primarily descended from the Eastern European immigrants of the immediate postwar years).

The organization has faced a corruption scandal involving financial irregularities under the administration of Werner Nachmann (president 1969 until 1988). After Nachmann&#x27;s death (January 1988), Heinz Galinski (1912‚Äì1992), the chairman of the West Berlin Jewish community for 43 years, assumed the leadership of the Central Council and brought it stability and respectability. Under Ignatz Bubis (1927‚Äì1999), the Central Council assumed a much greater profile in German public life, and the Jewish community&#x27;s leadership felt increasingly confident weighing in on public debates concerning Holocaust memory and German identity.

In more recent years, the division between more observant and more liberal Jews has strained the organisation, which remains (or claims to be) the sole representative body of the Jewish community in Germany and which generally supports strict observance. In April 2004, open controversy erupted between the leader of the Central Council, Paul Spiegel (1937‚Äì2006), and the leader of the more liberal organisation Union of Progressive Jews in Germany, Jan M√ºhlstein (born 1949). The latter demanded equal financial support from the government for his organisation.

In 2009, the Central Council criticised the Vatican over its decision to lift the excommunication on the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X. It later boycotted a ceremony in the Berlin parliament which commemorated victims of the Holocaust, saying its leaders had been treated without the proper respect in previous years.

<doc id="612345" wikidata="Q1992389" url="?curid=612345" title="Beaumaris">
<text>Beaumaris (; ) is a town and community on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, of which it is the former county town. It is located at the eastern entrance to the Menai Strait, the tidal waterway separating Anglesey from the coast of North Wales. At the 2021 census, its population was 1,121. The community includes Llanfaes.

==History==
Beaumaris was originally a Viking settlement known as (&quot;Port of the Vikings&quot;), but the town itself began its development in 1295 when Edward I of England, having conquered Wales, commissioned the building of Beaumaris Castle as part of a chain of fortifications around the North Wales coast (others include Conwy, Caernarfon and Harlech).

The castle was built on a marsh and that is where it found its name; the Norman-French builders called it , which translates as &quot;fair marsh&quot;.
The ancient village of Llanfaes, a mile to the north of Beaumaris, had been occupied by Anglo-Saxons in 818 but had been regained by Merfyn Frych, King of Gwynedd, and remained a vital strategic settlement. To counter further Welsh uprisings, and to ensure control of the Menai Strait, Edward I chose the flat coastal plain as the place to build Beaumaris Castle. The castle was designed by the Savoyard mason Master James of Saint George and is considered the most perfect example of a concentric castle. The &#x27;troublesome&#x27; residents of Llanfaes were removed &quot;en bloc&quot; to Rhosyr in the west of Anglesey, a new settlement King Edward entitled &quot;Newborough&quot;.

Beaumaris was awarded a royal charter by Edward I in 1296, which was drawn up on similar terms to the charters of his other castle towns in North Wales and intended to invest only the English and Norman-French residents with civic rights. Native Welsh residents of Beaumaris were largely disqualified from holding any civic office, carrying any weapon, and holding assemblies; and were not allowed to buy houses or land within the borough. The charter also specifically prohibited Jews (who had been largely expelled from most English towns) from living in Beaumaris.

From 1562 until the Reform Act 1832, the Beaumaris constituency was a rotten borough with the member of parliament elected by the corporation of the town, which was in the control of the Bulkeley family.

Beaumaris was the port of registration for all vessels in North West Wales, covering every harbour on Anglesey and all the ports from Conwy to Pwllheli. Shipbuilding was a major industry in Beaumaris. This was centred on Gallows Point ‚Äì a nearby spit of land extending into the Menai Strait about a mile west of the town. Gallows Point had originally been called &quot;Osmund&#x27;s Eyre&quot; but was renamed when the town gallows was erected there ‚Äì along with a &quot;Dead House&quot; for the corpses of criminals dispatched in public executions. Later, hangings were carried out at the town gaol and the bodies buried in a lime-pit within the curtilage of the gaol. One of the last prisoners to hang at Beaumaris issued a curse before he died ‚Äì decreeing that if he was innocent the four faces of the church clock would never show the same time.

Beaumaris was a haven of refuge in a storm to the passengers of the sailing ship, &quot;Everton,&quot; on a Thursday morning in November,1762 when it ran aground on a nearby sand bank. The ship&#x27;s Captain, knowing nothing could be done before high tide six hours hence, ordered the yawl to be lowered carrying himself and all the passengers to shore for fresh provisions in the town. One of those passengers was Devereux Jarratt from Virginia who was voyaging to London to receive holy orders from the Bishop of London in the Church of England. He writes in his autobiography, &quot;As I had eaten nothing for several days, but salt beef, ranced butter, black biscuit, &amp;tc. while on board, the meat, butter, and every thing I ate, at Beaumaris, exceeded any thing I ever had tasted in all my life. Having refreshed ourselves, in the most delicious and agreeable manner, we took a view of the town, and the remains of an old castle standing just without the town, which had been erected as a place of security and defence, by one of the first kings of England. Every thing appeared so delightful, and the inhabitants looked so fresh and ruddy, that I thought no people in the world could live better than the Welsh. The high mountain of Penmanmaur, lying over against the town, with the top in the clouds, and all the visible parts covered with snow, exhibited the most grand and majestic appearance, I had ever seen.&quot;

According to historian Hywel Teifi Edwards, when the &quot;Provincial Eisteddfod&quot; was held at Beaumaris in 1832, a young Princess Victoria and her mother were in attendance.

Beaumaris has never had a railway station built to the town, although the nearby village of Pentraeth had a station on the former Red Wharf Bay branch line which ran off the Anglesey Central Railway. It was roughly six miles west of the town by road. This station closed in 1930.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Beaumaris, at community (town) and county level: Beaumaris Town Council and Isle of Anglesey County Council. The town council is based at Beaumaris Town Hall on Castle Street.

===Administrative history===
Beaumaris was an ancient borough. It was awarded its first charter in 1296. In 1836 it became a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across Wales and England. The borough was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community. District-level functions passed to Ynys M√¥n-Isle of Anglesey Borough Council, which in 1996 was reconstituted as a county council.

==Architecture==

Notable buildings in the town include the castle, a courthouse built in 1614, the 14th-century St Mary&#x27;s and St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, Beaumaris Gaol, the 14th-century Tudor Rose (one of the oldest original timber-framed buildings in Britain) and the Bulls Head Inn, built in 1472, which General Thomas Mytton made his headquarters during the &quot;Siege of Beaumaris&quot; during the second English Civil War in 1648.

A native of Anglesey, David Hughes, founded Beaumaris Grammar School in 1603. It became a non-selective school in 1952 when Anglesey County Council became the first authority in Britain to adopt comprehensive secondary education. The school was eventually moved to Menai Bridge and only the ancient hall of the original school building now remains. Beaumaris Town Hall was completed in 1785.

Beaumaris Pier, opened in 1846, was designed by Frederick Foster and is a masonry jetty on wooden and concrete pilings. The pier was rebuilt and extended to after storm damage in 1872, and a large pavilion containing a cafe was built at the end. It was once the landing stage for steamships of the Liverpool and North Wales Shipping Company, including the &quot;Snowdon&quot;, &quot;La Marguerite&quot;, &quot;St. Elvies&quot; and &quot;St. Trillo&quot;, although the larger vessels in its fleet ‚Äì the &quot;St. Seriol&quot; and &quot;St. Tudno&quot; ‚Äì were too large for the pier and landed their passengers at Menai Bridge. In the 1960s, through lack of maintenance, the pier became unsafe and was threatened with demolition, but local yachtswoman and lifeboat secretary Miss Mary Burton made a large private donation to ensure the pier was saved for the town. A further reconstruction was carried out between 2010 and 2012.
The Saunders Roe company set up a factory at Fryars (the site of the old Franciscan friary to the east) when it was feared that the company&#x27;s main base on the Isle of Wight would be a target for World War II Luftwaffe bombers. The factory converted American-built PBY Catalina flying boats. After the war, the company focused on their ship building produced at the site with fast patrol boats, minesweepers and an experimental Austin Float Plane. They also produced buses for London Transport (RT Double deckers) and single deck buses for Cuba.

==Lifeboat==
The first recorded rescue of people in difficulty at sea was in 1830 when 375 people were rescued from a foundered emigrant ship. A lifeboat station was established in 1891 and closed four years later when a neighbouring station was provided with a more powerful lifeboat. The station was reopened in 1914 and is operated by the RNLI.

==Education==
Beaumaris is served by one primary school. Its 300-year-old grammar school moved to nearby Menai Bridge in 1963 and became the comprehensive Ysgol David Hughes.

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the United Kingdom Census 2021, 36.8 per cent of all usual residents aged 3+ in Beaumaris can speak Welsh. 56.3 per cent of the population noted that they could speak, read, write or understand Welsh.

The 2011 census noted 39.5 per cent of all usual residents aged 3 years and older in the town could speak Welsh. The 2011 census also noted that 58.7 per cent of all usual residents aged 3+ who were born in Wales could speak Welsh. In 2001, 39.7 per cent of all usual residents aged 3+ in Beaumaris could speak Welsh. In 1981, 39.9 per cent of the population could speak Welsh; 10 people were monoglot Welsh speakers.

<text>KOI8-R (RFC 1489) is an 8-bit character encoding, derived from the KOI-8 encoding by the programmer Andrei Chernov in 1993 and designed to cover Russian, which uses a Cyrillic alphabet. KOI8-R was based on Russian Morse code, which was created from a phonetic version of Latin Morse code. As a result, Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the normal Cyrillic alphabetical order. Although this may seem unnatural, if the 8th bit is stripped, the text is partially readable in ASCII and may convert to syntactically correct KOI-7. For example, &quot;–ö–æ–¥ –û–±–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π&quot; in KOI8-R becomes &quot;kOD oBMENA iNFORMACIEJ&quot; (the Russian meaning of the &quot;KOI&quot; acronym).

KOI8 stands for &quot;Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit&quot; () which means &quot;Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit&quot;. In Microsoft Windows, KOI8-R is assigned the code page number 20866. In IBM, KOI8-R is assigned code page 878. KOI8-R also happens to cover Bulgarian.

It lacks proper quotation marks for these languages: both ¬´...¬ª and the Bulgarian ‚Äû...‚Äú. Windows-1251 does support these, as well as more letters, and has thus become more popular. KOI8-R is used by less than 0.004% of websites, mostly Russian and Bulgarian. Unicode and UTF-8 is preferred to single-byte Cyrillic encodings in modern applications, Unicode contains 436 Cyrillic letters including for Old Cyrillic.

==Character set==
The following table shows the KOI8-R encoding. Each character is shown with its equivalent Unicode code point.

* KOI8-B, a derivation of KOI8-R with only the letter subset implemented
* KOI8-U, another derivative encoding which adds Ukrainian characters
* KOI character encodings
* RELCOM
* Windows-1251, another common Cyrillic character encoding
