<text>The Aleppo Codex () is a medieval bound manuscript of the Hebrew Bible. The codex was written in the city of Tiberias in the tenth century CE (circa 920) under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate, and was endorsed for its accuracy by Maimonides. Together with the Leningrad Codex, it contains the Aaron ben Moses ben Asher Masoretic Text tradition.

The codex was kept for five centuries in the Central Synagogue of Aleppo, until the synagogue was torched during 1947 anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo. The fate of the codex during the subsequent decade is unclear: when it resurfaced in Israel in 1958, roughly 40% of the manuscript‚Äîincluding the majority of the Torah section‚Äîwas missing, and only two additional leaves have been recovered since then. The original supposition that the missing pages were destroyed in the synagogue fire has increasingly been challenged, fueling speculation that they survive in private hands.

The portion of the codex that is accounted for is housed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.

==Name==
The codex&#x27;s Hebrew name is , translated as &quot;Crown of Aleppo&quot;. &quot;Kether&quot; means &quot;crown&quot;, and Aram-·π¢ova æ (literally &quot;outside Aram&quot;) was a not-yet-identified biblical city in what is now Syria whose name was applied from the 11th century onward by some Rabbinic sources and Syrian Jews to the area of Aleppo in Syria. &quot;Kether&quot; is a translation of Arabic &quot;tƒÅj&quot;, originally Persian &quot;&quot;; the codex was called &quot;al-TƒÅj&quot; by locals until the modern period. In Arabic, the term &quot;tƒÅj&quot; was used mostly as a stock superlative title (Muslim caliphs did not wear crowns) and applied liberally to model codices. It lost this sense when translated into Hebrew as &quot;kether&quot;, which has only the literal sense of crown.

==History==

===Overview===
The Karaite Jewish community of Jerusalem purchased the codex about a hundred years after it was made. When the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem in 1099, the synagogue was plundered. The codex was held for a high ransom, which was paid with money from Egypt, leading to the codex being transferred there. It was preserved by the Karaites, then at the Rabbanite synagogue in Old Cairo, where it was consulted by Maimonides, who described it as a text trusted by all Jewish scholars. It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides&#x27; descendants brought it to Mamluk-ruled Aleppo, leading to its present name.

The Codex remained in Syria for nearly six hundred years. In 1947, rioters enraged by the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine burned down the synagogue where it was kept. The Codex disappeared, then reemerged in 1958, when it was smuggled into Israel by Syrian Jew Murad Faham and presented to the president of the state, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. Sometime after arrival, it was found that parts of the codex had been lost. The Aleppo Codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It is currently (2019) on display in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.

Israel submitted the Aleppo Codex for inclusion in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World international register and was included in 2015.

===Ransom from Crusaders (1100)===
The Karaite Jewish community of Jerusalem received the book from Israel ben Simha of Basra sometime between 1040 and 1050. It was cared for by the brothers Hizkiyahu and Joshya, Karaite religious leaders who eventually moved to Fustat (today part of Old Cairo) in 1050. The codex, however, stayed in Jerusalem until the latter part of that century. After the Siege of Jerusalem (1099) during the First Crusade, the Crusaders held the codex for ransom. Letters in the Cairo Geniza describe the inhabitants of Ashkelon borrowing money from Egypt to &quot;buy back two hundred and thirty Bible codices, a hundred other volumes, and eight Torah Scrolls&quot; from the Crusaders which may have included the codex. A Judeo-Arabic inscription on the lost first page of the Codex described that the book was
===In Aleppo ===
The Aleppo community guarded the Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together with three other Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the Central Synagogue of Aleppo, supposed to have been the Cave of Elijah. It was regarded as the community&#x27;s most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews worldwide, who asked that various textual details be checked, preserved in the responsa literature. It allowed for the reconstruction of information in the missing parts today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, Shalom Shachne Yellin sent his son-in-law, Moses Joshua Kim·∏•i, to Aleppo to copy information about the Codex; Kim·∏•i sat for weeks and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten Bible. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book &quot;‚ÄòAmmud√© Shesh&quot; by Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski, and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by Yosef Ofer in 1989.

However, the community limited outsiders&#x27; direct observation of the manuscript, especially by scholars in modern times. Paul E. Kahle, when revising the text of the &quot;Biblia Hebraica&quot; in the 1920s, tried and failed to obtain a photographic copy. This forced him to use the &quot;Leningrad Codex&quot; instead for the third edition, which appeared in 1937.

The only modern scholar allowed to compare it with a standard printed Hebrew Bible and take notes on the differences was Umberto Cassuto, who examined it in 1943. This secrecy made it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the Codex, and indeed Cassuto doubted that it was Maimonides&#x27; codex, though he agreed that it was tenth century.

===Loss of pages (1947‚Äì1958)===

During the 1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo, the community&#x27;s ancient synagogue was burned. Later, while the Codex was in Israel, it was found that no more than 294 of the original (estimated) 487 pages survived.

The missing leaves are a subject of fierce controversy. Initially, it was thought they were destroyed by fire, but scholarly analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus). Some scholars instead accuse Jewish community members of having torn off the missing leaves and kept them privately hidden. Two missing portions of the manuscript‚Äîa single complete leaf from the Book of Chronicles and a fragment of a page from the Book of Exodus‚Äîwere turned up from such sources in the 1980s, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947. In particular, the 2012 book &quot;The Aleppo Codex&quot; by Matti Friedman calls attention to the fact that eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of it for more than a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put, in 1958, in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests several possibilities for the loss of the pages including theft in Israel.

Documentary filmmaker Avi Dabach, great-grandson of Hacham Ezra Dabach (one of the last caretakers of the Codex when it was still in Syria), announced in December 2015 an upcoming film tracing the history of the Codex and possibly determining the fate of the missing pages. The film, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in 2018.

===In Israel===

In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria and sent to Jerusalem to be placed in the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. It was given first to Shlomo Zalman Shragai of the Jewish Agency, who later testified that the Codex was complete or nearly so at the time. Later that year, it was given to the Ben-Zvi Institute. Still during 1958, the Jewish community of Aleppo sued the Ben-Zvi Institute for the return of the Codex. The court ruled against them and suppressed the publication of the proceedings.

In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars a chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex that not only was it the oldest known Masoretic Text (ùï∏) in a single volume, but it was the first time that one or two people had produced a complete Tanakh as a unified entity in a consistent style.

During the Gulf War, and again during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war, the scrolls were placed in secure storage as part of the Israel Museum&#x27;s emergency protocol.

====Reconstruction attempts====
Later, after the university denied him access to the codex, Mordechai Breuer began his reconstruction of the Masoretic text based on other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost precisely. Breuer&#x27;s version is used authoritatively to reconstruct the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The &quot;Jerusalem Crown&quot; (), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its page layout.

==Superstitions==
Among the Jewish community of Aleppo and their descendants in the post-1947 diaspora, the belief always was that the Codex holds great magical power and that the smallest piece of it can ensure its owner&#x27;s good health and well-being. Historically, it was believed that women allowed to look at it would become pregnant and that those in charge of the keys to the Codex vault were blessed. On the other hand, history left every quire with the inscription &quot;Sanctified to God, not to be sold or bought,&quot; and the first leaf once included a common warning for medieval Hebrew manuscripts, &quot;Cursed be he who steals it, and cursed be he who sells it.&quot;

==Authoritative text==
The consonants in the codex were copied by the scribe Shlomo ben Buya&#x27;a in Palestine circa 920. The text was then verified, vocalized, and provided with Masoretic notes by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, the last and most prominent member of the ben Asher dynasty of grammarians from Tiberias, rivals to the ben Naphtali school. The tradition of ben Asher has become the one accepted for the Hebrew Bible. The ben Asher vocalization is late and in many respects artificial, compared to other traditions and tendencies reaching back closer to the period of spoken Biblical Hebrew.

The &quot;Leningrad Codex&quot;, which dates to approximately the same time as the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher scriptorium. However, its colophon says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.

The community of Damascus possessed a counterpart of the Aleppo Codex, known as the Damascus Pentateuch in academic circles and as the &quot;Damascus Keter&quot;, or &quot;Crown of Damascus&quot;, in traditional Jewish circles. It was also written in Israel in the tenth century, and is now kept at the National Library of Israel as &quot;ms. Heb 5702&quot;. It is available online here . (This should not be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin.)

The Aleppo Codex was the manuscript used by Maimonides when he set down the exact rules for writing scrolls of the Torah, &quot;Hilkhot Sefer Torah&quot; (&quot;Laws of the Torah Scroll&quot;) in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. This halachic ruling gave the Aleppo Codex the seal of supreme textual authority, albeit only concerning the type of space preceding sections (petuhot and setumot) and the manner of the writing of the songs in the Pentateuch. &quot;The codex which we used in these works is the codex known in Egypt, which includes 24 books, which was in Jerusalem,&quot; he wrote. David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra testifies to this being the same codex that was later transferred to Aleppo.

==Physical description==
The Codex, as it presents itself now in the Israel Museum where it is kept in a vault, consists of the 294 pages delivered by the Ben-Zvi Institute, plus one full page and a section of a second one recovered subsequently. The pages are preserved unbound and written on both sides. Each page is parchment, 33¬†cm high by 26.5¬†cm wide (13 inches √ó 10.43 inches). In particular, only the last few pages of the Torah are extant. The ink was made of three types of gall, ground and mixed with black soot and iron sulfate.

The manuscript has been restored by specialists of the Israel Museum, whose director declared that, given the Codex&#x27;s history, it is &quot;in remarkably excellent condition&quot;. The purple markings on the edges of the pages were found to be mold rather than fire damage.

==Contents==
When the Aleppo Codex was complete (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual tradition in the order of its books, similar to the &quot;Leningrad Codex&quot;, and which also matches the later tradition of Sephardi biblical manuscripts. The Torah and the Nevi&#x27;im appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for the books for Ketuvim differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is Books of Chronicles, Psalms, Book of Job, Book of Proverbs, Book of Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Book of Lamentations, Book of Esther, Book of Daniel, and Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah.

The current text is missing all of the Pentateuch to the Book of Deuteronomy 28.17; II Kings 14.21‚Äì18.13; Book of Jeremiah 29.9‚Äì31.33; 32.2‚Äì4, 9‚Äì11, 21‚Äì24; Book of Amos 8.12‚ÄìBook of Micah 5.1; So 3.20‚ÄìZa 9.17; II Chronicles 26.19‚Äì35.7; Book of Psalms 15.1‚Äì25.2 (MT enumeration); Song of Songs 3.11 to the end; all of Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra-Nehemiah.

In 2016, the scholar Yosef Ofer published a newly recovered fragment of the Aleppo Codex with some portions of the Book of Exodus 8.

==Modern editions==
Several complete or partial editions of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex have been published over the past three decades in Israel, some of them under the academic auspices of Israeli universities. These editions incorporate reconstructions of the missing parts of the codex based on the methodology of Mordechai Breuer or similar systems, and by taking into account all available historical testimony about the contents of the codex.

Complete Tanakh:
These are complete editions of the Tanakh, usually in one volume (but sometimes also sold in three volumes, and, as noted, in more). Apart from the last, they do &quot;not&quot; include the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
# Mossad HaRav Kook edition, Mordechai Breuer, ed. Torah (1977); Nebi&#x27;im (1979); Ketubim (1982); full Tanakh in one volume 1989. This was the first edition to include a reconstruction of the letters, vowels, and cantillation marks in the missing parts of the Aleppo codex. Mossad HaRav Kook also uses its Breuer text in other editions of the Bible it publishes, including its Da&#x27;at Mikrah commentary (complete in 30 volumes) and its Torat Hayim edition of Mikraot Gedolot, which thus far includes Torah (7 vols.), Psalms (3 vols.), Proverbs (2 vols.), and Five Megillot (3 vols.), as well as some non-Biblical texts such as the Haggadah.
# Horev publishers, Jerusalem, 1996‚Äì98. Mordechai Breuer, ed. This was the first edition to incorporate newly discovered information on the parashah divisions of the Aleppo Codex for Nebi&#x27;im and Ketubim. The text of the Horev Tanakh has been reprinted in several forms with various commentaries by the same publisher, including a Mikraot Gedolot on the Torah.
# &quot;Jerusalem Crown: The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem&quot;, 2000. Edited according to the method of Mordechai Breuer under the supervision of Yosef Ofer, with additional proofreading and refinements since the Horev edition.
# Jerusalem Simanim Institute, Feldheim Publishers, 2004 (published in one-volume and three-volume editions).
# Mikraot Gedolot Haketer, Bar-Ilan University (1992‚Äìpresent).

<text>Anson Peaslee Morrill (June 10, 1803¬†‚Äì July 4, 1887) was an American politician who served as the 24th governor of Maine from 1855 to 1856 and later as the U.S. representative from Maine&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1861 to 1863.

==Biography==
Morrill was born in 1803 in Belgrade (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts). In his early years, Morrill served as the Postmaster of Dearborn and ran a general store. He was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1833 from Belgrade. He served as Cumberland County Sheriff in 1839, and was subsequently elected the State House from Madison in 1844. In 1850, Morrill was appointed State Land Agent, and served until 1854.

Though Morrill was a Democrat, he emerged as the Maine Law candidate for governor in 1853. In that year&#x27;s gubernatorial election, Morrill placed third, winning 13% of the vote to Democrat Albert Pillsbury&#x27;s 44% and incumbent Whig Governor William Crosby‚Äôs 32%. No candidate received a majority of the vote, which threw the election to the state legislature. Though the governing coalition of Whigs, Free Soilers, and anti-Maine Law Democrats originally agreed to elect Morrill as governor, the Whigs backed out‚Äîand instead re-elected Crosby as governor.

Morrill again in 1854, this time as the Know Nothing nominee, and won 49% of the vote to Albion Parris&#x27;s 31% and Isaac Reed&#x27;s 15%. The election was once again thrown to the legislature, which elected Morrill. He ran for re-election in 1855 as the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, but though he won 47% of the vote to Democrat Samuel Wells&#x27;s 44%, the legislature elected Wells over Morrill.

In 1860, Morrill was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Maine&#x27;s 4th congressional district. Though James G. Blaine had originally planned on running for the seat, he deferred to Morrill. In 1862, Morrill opted against seeking re-election to allow Blaine to run. After leaving Congress, he served as President of the Maine Central Railroad. He served one final term as a member of the Maine House from 1881 to 1882. In 1882, Morrill urged Blaine, his old friend, to run for Congress, but Blaine declined.

Governor Morrill died in 1887 in Augusta, Maine and is buried at the Forest Grove Cemetery in Augusta.

In November 2000, a partnership between Stornoway Communications and Cogeco was granted a category 1 television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) called &quot;The Issues Channel&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language specialty television service dedicated to public affairs programming, that will examine matters of public interest and concern in an engaging format.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as ichannel.

In January 2004, the CRTC approved an application for Stornoway to acquire Cogeco&#x27;s interest in the service.

On August 15, 2016, iChannel ceased broadcasting, after Stornoway requested that the CRTC revoke its license ‚Äúdue to the inability to secure sustainable packaging by Canadian BDUs [Beoadcasting Distribution Undertakings].‚Äù The station&#x27;s ad revenues had fallen from $405,966 in 2012 to $78,798 in 2015.

<text>is a Japanese multinational mobility manufacturer headquartered in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka. It manufactures automobiles, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), outboard marine engines, wheelchairs and a variety of other small internal combustion engines. In 2016, Suzuki was the eleventh biggest automaker by production worldwide.
Suzuki has over 45,000 employees and has 35 production facilities in 23 countries, and 133 distributors in 192 countries. The worldwide sales volume of automobiles is the world&#x27;s tenth largest, while domestic sales volume is the third largest in the country.

Suzuki&#x27;s domestic motorcycle sales volume is the third largest in Japan.

==History==
In 1909, Michio Suzuki (1887‚Äì1982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in the small seacoast village of Hamamatsu, Japan. Business boomed as Suzuki built weaving looms for Japan&#x27;s giant silk industry. In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company&#x27;s first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.

Despite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact prototype cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum crankcase and gearbox and generated from a displacement of less than 800¬†cc.

With the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki&#x27;s new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a &quot;non-essential commodity.&quot; At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki&#x27;s fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.

Faced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering &quot;clip-on&quot; gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki&#x27;s first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the &quot;Power Free.&quot; Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the 1952 Power Free had a 36¬†cc, one horsepower, two-stroke engine. The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone. The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial subsidy to continue research in motorcycle engineering.

By 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. Following the success of his first motorcycles, Suzuki created an even more successful automobile: the 1955 Suzuki Suzulight. The Suzulight sold with front-wheel drive, four-wheel independent suspension and rack-and-pinion steering, which were not common on cars until three decades later.

From 1981 to 1982, Suzuki played a prominent role in setting up the first largely foreign owned car company in India, Maruti Suzuki. Though originally majority-owned by the Indian government, Suzuki, which initially owned 26%, would obtain more shares of Maruti Suzuki in 2003, and later acquire the majority of the India-based subsidiary in 2007.

Volkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. This situation did not last, as Suzuki accused Volkswagen of not sharing promised technology while Volkswagen objected to a deal where Suzuki purchased diesel engines from Fiat. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki. Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back in September 2015.

In November 2012, low sales forced Suzuki to closes its branches in the United States.

===Leadership===
The company was founded by Michio Suzuki. In 1978, the company would be taken over by Osamu Suzuki, the fourth adopted son-in-law in a row to run the company, Osamu Suzuki, the 91 year old Chairman of Suzuki Motor Corporation, retired in June 2021, handing over to his son Toshihiro; Osamu Suzuki, who is credited with building the company into its current status and who also still stayed on as an advisor following his retirement as chairman, died in December 2024.

===Timeline===

The Suzuki Loom Company started in 1909 as a manufacturer of looms for weaving silk and cotton. Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines. Michio&#x27;s desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World War II. Before it began building four-stroke engines, Suzuki Motor Corp. was known for its two-stroke engines (for motorcycles and autos). After the war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized bicycle, but eventually the company would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for dominating racetracks around the world. Even after producing its first car in 1955 the company didn&#x27;t have an automobile division until 1961. Today Suzuki is among the world&#x27;s largest automakers, and a major brand name in important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in North America.

===Maruti Suzuki India Limited (Formerly &quot;Maruti Udyog Limited&quot;)===


Based in Gurgaon, Haryana, Maruti Suzuki India Limited is an Indian automobile manufacturer that is a subsidiary of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation. Maruti Suzuki produced 1,133,695 units between 1 April 2011 and 30 March 2012. The Suzuki Motor Corporation owns 54.2% of Maruti Suzuki and the rest is owned by various Indian public and financial institutions. The company was incorporated in 1981 and is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India.

Maruti Suzuki was born as a Government of India-led company named Maruti Udyog Limited, with Suzuki as a minor partner, to make lower priced cars for middle class Indians. Over the years, the product range has widened and ownership has changed hands as the customer has evolved.

Maruti Suzuki offers models ranging from the Maruti 800 to the premium sedan Maruti Suzuki Kizashi and luxury SUV Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. Maruti 800 was the first model launched by the company in 1983 followed by mini-van Maruti Omni in 1984. Maruti Gypsy, launched in 1985, came into widespread use with the Indian Army and Indian Police Service becoming its primary customers. The short-lived Maruti 1000 was replaced by Maruti Esteem in 1994.

Maruti Zen, launched in 1993, was the company&#x27;s second compact car model. The company went on to launch another compact car Maruti Wagon-R followed by Maruti Baleno in 1999. It was later replaced by the Suzuki SX4. The SX4 further was replaced by Ciaz.

In 2000, Maruti Alto was launched. The Maruti models include Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, launched in 2003, Maruti Versa, launched in 2004, Maruti Suzuki Swift, launched in 2005, Maruti Zen Estilo and Maruti Suzuki SX4, launched in 2007.

On 14 February 2011, Maruti announced that it had achieved one million total accumulated production volume of the Alto. The Alto has reached the million units mark in just seven years and five months since its launch in September 2000. The last half of the million was achieved in 25 months. The Alto became the third car by Maruti Suzuki stable to cross the million units mark, following the Maruti 800 and the Omni.

In January 2012 at the New Delhi Auto Expo, Maruti presented a new car called the Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha, to commence production in mid-late 2013. Maruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a contender in the subcompact SUV segment.

Maruti Exports Limited is Maruti&#x27;s exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for Maruti Suzuki and for the international Suzuki Motor Corporation as well as their other affiliates. The first commercial consignment of 480 cars were sent to Hungary. By sending a consignment of 571 cars to the same country, Maruti crossed the benchmark of 3,000,000 cars. Since its inception export was one of the aspects the government has been keen to encourage.

===American Suzuki Motor Corp.===
American Suzuki headquarters is in Brea, California. The company announced in November 2012 that it would stop selling cars in the United States.

Through an agreement with General Motors, Suzuki began selling a version of their Suzuki Cultus in the United States as the Chevrolet Sprint in 1985. This model was initially sold as a 3-door hatchback and would be Chevrolet&#x27;s smallest model.
The Samurai was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a convertible or hardtop and the company slogan was &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot;. The Samurai was successful until Consumer Reports alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized 1996 lawsuit, not settled until 2004.

In 1989, American Suzuki introduced the Swift which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the Sidekick was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM&#x27;s Geo Metro and Geo Tracker and were mostly produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM&#x27;s joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from Consumer Reports of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.

In 1995, American Suzuki introduced the Esteem and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front airbags. A station wagon version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this year.

Also in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV X-90 and a revised Sidekick Sport model with dual airbags, a 1.6¬†liter engine, 15¬†inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the Vitara and the Grand Vitara for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki&#x27;s first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel ABS brakes.

The XL-7 was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7¬†liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki&#x27;s largest vehicle to date.

The Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the Esteem was replaced in 2002 by the new Aerio, which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door crossover with 4-wheel drive as an option.

In 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt Daewoo Motors renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact Daewoo Nubira/Daewoo Lacetti as the Forenza and the mid-size Daewoo Magnus as the Verona. The Forenza gained station wagon and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the Reno name.

2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new SX4 and XL7 in 2007. The Suzuki SX4 is produced as a joint venture with Fiat and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.

Despite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008. In 2009 however, Suzuki sales dropped 48.5%, following a 17% sales drop in 2008. Suzuki did not import any 2010 model year street motorcycles into the US, with dealers instead relying on unsold stock from the 2009 model year. New street motorcycle models to the US resumed for the 2011 model year.

In November 2012, Suzuki announced that its US division would file for bankruptcy and would stop selling automobiles in the United States. It plans to continue to sell motorcycles, ATVs, and marine products in the US. In ten months of 2012, Suzuki sold only 21,188 automobiles in the US. The combination of a strong yen and Suzuki&#x27;s own limited offering of models has been blamed for the downturn.

===Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited===

Following the terms of the joint-venture agreement between Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan (SMC) and Pakistan Automobile Corporation (PACO), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) was incorporated as a public limited company in August 1983.

The new company assumed the assets including production facilities of Awami Autos Limited. PSMCL started commercial operations in January 1984 with the primary objective of passenger cars, pick ups, vans and 4x4 vehicles.

The groundbreaking ceremony of the company&#x27;s green field automobile plant at Bin Qasim was performed by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan in early 1989.

On completion of first phase of this plant in early 1990, in-house assembly Suzuki engines started. The new plant was completed in 1992, and Suzuki production was transferred to new plant ‚Äì and three-box 1,300¬†cc Margalla car was also added to its range of production.

In September 1992 the company was privatized and placed directly under the Japanese Management. At the time of privatization SMC increased its equity from 25% to 40% Subsequently, SMC progressively increased its equity to 73.09% by 31 December 2001.

A separate company, &quot;PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales (SIS)&quot;, previously &quot;PT Indomobil Niaga International&quot;, handled sales and marketing of Suzuki automobiles and motorcycles.

Suzuki has done its first activities on the Indonesian market in 1970 about its import firm PT. Indohero Steel &amp; Engineering Company. Six years later they were built the manufacturing facility in Jakarta which is the oldest part of the Indomobil Group.

Their first product was the ST20 Carry (introduced in 1978), it saw extensive use as an Angkot. Nicknamed &quot;Trungtung&quot;, it was built until at least 1983. This is an onomatopoetic word for the sound made by the Carry&#x27;s two-stroke engine.

In 2011, the company invested $800 million for producing Low Cost Green Car (LCGC) in Indonesia. In 2013, Suzuki opened another plant in Cikarang with a total investment of $1 billion. The plant manufactured Ertiga MPV for both domestic and export markets and K10B engine for Karimun Wagon R.

===Suzuki Motorcycle India, Private Limited===
&quot;Suzuki Motorcycle India, Private Limited (SMIL)&quot; is the wholly owned Indian subsidiary of Suzuki, Japan. The company has a manufacturing plant at Gurgaon, Haryana having the annual capacity of 5,40,000 units.

On October 30, 2024, Suzuki Motor&#x27;s Indian unit supplied its first electric vehicle to Toyota Motor, with production starting in spring 2025 at Suzuki&#x27;s plant in Gujarat, India.

===Concept automobiles===


* GSX-R/4 concept car was presented in 2001. It is fitted with a engine taken from the GSX1300R Hayabusa motorcycle in an attempt to split the difference, merging the posture of an automobile and the disposition of a sportbike (Suzuki had been particularly successful selling motorcycles in the United States). Its high-revving inline-four engine supplied about 175¬†hp to a bare-bones, two-seat roadster weighing less than 1500 pounds.
* Pixy + SSC concept was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The Pixy is an enclosed three-wheel, single-seat personal transport pod, similar to the Toyota i-unit, and i-REAL, but dissimilar in that two Pixies can dock inside the SSC (aka Suzuki Sharing Coach) for highway driving. Electric power is generated by a hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels to drive the SSC carrier van, and to recharge the Pixy at the same time.
* Hayabusa Sport was a sports car unveiled at the 2002 Tokyo Auto Salon. Its engine - the same 1.3l I4 as found in the GSXR/4 and the GSXR-1300R Hayabusa sports bike it was named after - would produce 175¬†hp at 9800rpm and was mated to a 6-speed sequential gearbox. Due to characteristics such as its front-mid engine positioning and diminutive carbon-fibre body, Suzuki achieved an optimal front:rear weight distribution of 50:50 and a markedly low mass of 550¬†kg. One prototype was created and, while conceived as a street-legal car, was not ever used on the road.
*X-HEAD is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show. It has a somewhat unusual design, looking similar to a dump truck. It has an X pattern on its tires, but the X in its name is attributed to its multipurpose capability.
* Suzuki Concept X debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show as a significant departure in styling for a Suzuki mid-sized sport utility vehicle aimed at younger buyers in the North American market. This concept vehicle evolved into the second-generation XL7 introduced late in 2006.
* G70 appeared at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show as the Regina, but was renamed before the 2012 Salon International de l&#x27;Auto and Auto China shows to signify that it met the goal of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions no higher than 70g/km (and perhaps that &quot;Regina&quot; as a model name would be a marketing fiasco). The G70 is a concept for the next-generation global compact car, possibly replacing the Alto, and at long and wide with a weight of , the G70 is smaller and lighter than the Alto. It has an extremely economical , direct-injection turbo gasoline engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, and a claimed fuel mileage of .
* Q-concept, first shown at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, is a bubble car like the MIT CityCar, Nissan Pivo or Toyota PM. Just in length, the Q-concept has its driver and one passenger riding in tandem but is more comfortable than a motorcycle, being enclosed and having seats instead of a saddle. Intended primarily for short trips (within ) it ought to be able to park in nearly any available space.
* Suzuki unveiled the iK-2 concept at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show.
* Suzuki showed the 4x4 mini SUV concept iM-4 concept at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015.

==Motorcycles==

Suzuki started manufacturing motorcycles in 1952, the first models being motorized bicycles. From 1955 to 1976 the company manufactured motorcycles with two-stroke engines only, the biggest two-stroke model being the water-cooled triple-cylinder G2F5.

A large factor in Suzuki&#x27;s success in two-stroke competition was the East German Grand Prix racer Ernst Degner, who defected to the West in 1961, bringing with him expertise in two-stroke engines from the East German manufacturer MZ. The secrets Degner brought with him were three crucial technologies: the boost port, the expansion chamber, and the rotary valve. Walter Kaaden of MZ was the first engineer to combine these three crucial technologies.

Suzuki hired Degner, and he won the 50 cc class FIM road racing World Championship for them in the 1962 season. Suzuki became the first Japanese manufacturer to win a motocross world championship when Joel Robert won the 1970 250¬†cc title. In the 1970s, Suzuki established themselves in the motorcycle racing world with Barry Sheene Marco Lucchinelli1981 Franco Uncini1982 winning world championships in the premier 500¬†cc class.

In 1976 Suzuki introduced its first motorcycles since the Colleda COX of the 1950s with four-stroke engines, the GS400 and GS750.

In 1994, Suzuki partnered with Nanjing Jincheng Machinery to create a Chinese motorcycle manufacturer and exporter called Jincheng Suzuki.

Suzuki continued to compete in MotoGP and last won the title in the 2000 season. From 2006 to 2011, the team was sponsored by Rizla and was known as Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team. On 18 November 2011, Suzuki announced that the GP racing was suspended, partly due to natural disasters and recession, until 2014. Suzuki returned to MotoGP in 2015.

The next few years in MotoGP were rather experimental for Suzuki, with some spotty success; but in 2020, on Suzuki&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Spanish rider Joan Mir surprised the world by cinching the 2020 MotoGP World Championship, Suzuki&#x27;s first GP conquest since Kenny Roberts Jr&#x27;s World Championship win in 2000.

In addition Suzuki have recorded a total of 94 victories at the Isle of Man TT Races. Suzuki have also taken the runner up spot in the various race categories 100 times and a total 92 third places.

===Models===
Some notable Suzuki motorcycles include the following:

====Two-stroke engines====
* X6 Hustler twin (aka T20 Super Six) was sold from 1966 to 1968 as &quot;the fastest 250cc motorcycle in the world&quot;. It had Suzuki&#x27;s new Posi-Force automatic oil injection system (later called Suzuki CCI). Production peaked at more than 5000 units per month. In 2013, Suzuki renewed the &quot;Hustler&quot; motorcycle trademark for Europe, leading to rumors of a retro style 250 twin. A 1967 T20 Super Six was included in the Las Vegas show of &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibition.
* T500 Titan (aka T500 Cobra, GT500) had a 500¬†cc air-cooled parallel-twin engine which overcame problems with durability, overheating and vibration. With an output of at 6,500¬†rpm and top speed of , it became Suzuki&#x27;s flagship machine in 1968, and remains popular with collectors and caf√© racers.
* GT750 Le Mans with a straight-three engine was the first Japanese motorcycle with a liquid-cooled engine, earning it the moniker &quot;Water Buffalo.&quot; The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan includes the 1971 Suzuki GT750 as one of their &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;.
* TM400 Cyclone production motocrosser was designed to participate in 500¬†cc class Motocross World Championship racing. Introduced in 1971, it was notoriously difficult even for skilled riders to control. Redesigned in 1975.
* The RM125 production motocrosser debuted in 1975 to replace the TM125. It was a successful forerunner of the future RM series line-up from 50¬†cc to 500¬†cc.
* RM250 was fully redesigned in 1982 and the liquid-cooled single-cylinder delivered more power than any production 250¬†cc motorcrosser of the time. It had Suzuki&#x27;s original full floater, link-type rear suspension introduced a year earlier.
* RG250 Gamma of 1983 was one of the new generation of race replica sport bikes of the 1980s. It had an aluminum frame, a full fairing and a high output straight-twin engine. The 1983 RG250Œì is one of the JSAE &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;.
* RG500 Gamma of 1985 was like RG250, but with a square-four engine.
* RGV250 Gamma, the road-racing replica of Kevin Schwantz&#x27;s RGV500 GP race bike, replaced the RG250 in 1988 with a V-twin engine.

====Four-stroke engines====

* GS series ‚Äì The 1976 GS750 was the first 4-stroke machine released by Suzuki in 20 years. The following year saw Suzuki&#x27;s first 1-liter machine, the GS1000E, and then in 1979 the GS1000S copy of a Yoshimura GS1000 Superbike.
* Katana ‚Äì The GSX1100S was released in Europe in 1980; the GSX1000S arrived in the U.S. and Canada later that year as a 1981 model, and revolutionized sportbike styling. A 1982 Katana GS1000SV is on the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame‚Ä≥s list of &quot;classic bikes&quot; that have been shown in the museum, and was in &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibition.
* GSX-R750 was one of the Japanese sport bikes of the 1980s that began the modern race replica era. It had air/oil cooling, light weight, and a powerful engine. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan includes the 1984 Suzuki GSX-R750 as one of their &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;, and was in &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot;.
* Intruder 750 with its OHC 4-valve 45¬∞ V-twin engine was the first Japanese cruiser motorcycle (designed to appeal to U.S. riders) in 1985. By 1997, cruiser-style motorcycles would account for nearly 60 percent of the U.S. street-bike market.
* GSX-R1100, related to the GSX-R750, appeared in 1986. The same basic engine would reappear in 1995 to power the Bandit 1200 and remain in production through 2006.
* Suzuki GSF1200 Bandit - Released in 1996 after the fully-faired RF900, the big, GSXR-powered Bandit offered stunning performance with real-world ergonomics and capabilities, and has become something of a &quot;cult&quot; model. These units have been used widely from road-race to Open Road Touring, were renowned for their versatility, robustness and massive torque production. Many are still in operation. The carbureted, air (and oil)-cooled design ran from 1996 to 2002; afterward Suzuki moved into fuel injection and liquid cooling on subsequent models. The last of the series was the GSX1250Fa. Though not technically labeled as a &quot;Bandit&quot;, it was the last in the long, popular line. Black, with a full-fairing, the GSX/Fa sold for only two years, between 2010 and 2011. Critics praised the model, like the earlier GSF, for its ergonomics and practical, &quot;Do-It-All&quot; capabilities; but market desire sagged due to the final model&#x27;s heavy weight and relatively low power output.
* The &quot;DR-BIG&quot; aka &quot;Desert Express&quot; DR800S off-roader was existent for two model years as the DR750S until 1990, when its displacement increased to 779¬†cc, still the world largest single cylinder engine in a production motorcycle. Available in Europe through 1999, it was not exported to the U.S. market. Replaced by the V-Strom twin, the &quot;DR-BIG&quot; has now come full circle as the design inspiration for a 2014 overhaul of the V-Strom 1000 ABS. As of 2020, the DR-BIG acted as the inspiration of the revisioned Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
* Suzuki RF Series The Suzuki RF series are sport touring motorcycles. They came with three engine variations: 400, 600 and 900 cc. It was in production from 1994 to 1998.
* TL1000S debuted at the 1996 International Motorcycle and Scooter Show as the first Suzuki sport bike with a V-twin engine. This was a liquid-cooled, 90¬∞ V-twin, DOHC engine with 4 valves per cylinder, which would be in production through 2012. Although the TL1000S motorcycle ceased production in 2001, the engine would carry on in the TL1000R, the SV1000 and SV1000S, as well as the V-Strom 1000 and the Suzuki V-Strom 1050.
* GSX-R600 ‚Äì a smaller version of the GSX-R750. There were earlier pretenders, but the genuine article arrived in 1997 and has received frequent updates after that.
* Hayabusa (GSX-1300R) was introduced in 1998, and remains Suzuki&#x27;s flagship sport bike. The 1998 Suzuki Hayabusa is included in the JSAE &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;. The development of a second generation Hayabusa for the 2008 model year facilitated the 2007 roll-out of the GSX-1300BK B-King, a highly stylized naked variant.
* SV650 was introduced in 1999 as a budget entry in the naked bike market, and since 2001, offered both naked and fully faired. In 2009 the naked bike version was redesigned and renamed the Gladius in keeping with the sword motif Suzuki established with the &quot;Katana.&quot; The Gladius motorcycle won a Good Design Award (aka &quot;G Mark&quot;) from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion.
* GSX-R1000 ‚Äì This top-of-the-line superbike debuted in 2000, and remains the largest model of the GSX-R series.
* Burgman 650 (AN650) was the largest of a series of urban scooters produced in Japan (marketed as &quot;Skywave&quot; domestically) as well as in Italy and Spain with engine capacities of 125¬†cc and up. When it appeared in 2002 the 650 was the largest-displacement scooter in the world, and first two-wheel vehicle to have an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission. The Japan Institute of Design Promotion awarded the &quot;G Mark&quot; Good Design Award to the Skywave 650 in 2003, to the entire Skywave series in 2006 and to the updated Skywave 650LX in 2013.
** Choinori was a lightweight, inexpensive, 50¬†cc scooter and the antithesis of the Skywave 650, but they were introduced at the same time in an effort to increase domestic sales in response to shrinking motorcycle exports. The 2002 Choinori is one of the JSAE &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;. The Choinori was awarded the &quot;G Mark&quot; Good Design Award in 2003.
* Boulevard M109R (VZR1800) V-twin, dubbed the Intruder M1800R in Europe, arrived in 2006 boasting a bore with a stroke, amongst the largest gasoline engine pistons ever used in any production motorcycle (or passenger car).
* GSX-650F ‚Äì introduced in 2008, this new sport touring model fills the void of the retired Katana. The 2009 model has ABS standard.
* Suzuki DR125 - a 124¬†cc four stroke motorcycle.
* Suzuki DR650(SE) - a legendary 644¬†cc four stroke dual sport motorcycle.
* DL-650 V-Strom ‚Äì a dual-sport motorcycle
* GSX-250F Across ‚Äì a small 250 cc engine sport touring motorcycle produced from 1990 until 1998. It is mostly known as a practical sports/touring bike, due to its rear petrol tank and a fully enclosed helmet storage area where the petrol tank usually is.
* Suzuki GSX-R250 ‚Äì a motorcycle that was manufactured from 1987 to 1994. A couple of years after the presentation of the GSX-R750 the 250 cc GSX-R250 was released. Like the larger bike, the GSX-R250 had a box-frame (steel, not aluminum), full fairing, full-floater rear swing and a four-cylinder four-stroke engine. But while the GSX-R750 engine was air and oil-cooled, the baby brother had a liquid-cooled engine. Not many examples are seen outside Japan. 17-inch cast wheels and 300¬†mm twin disc brake at the front. The GSX-R250 had impressive power and was made primarily as a road legal 250 cc racing bike reaching speeds of 200+km/h (124¬†mph). Imported specimens may be seen in Australia and New Zealand commonly. Also, around 350 units were exported to Denmark around 1989 to 1992. Starting in 2017, the engine continued in the Suzuki V-Strom 250.

====Other power sources====

* RE5 was the first (and only) Japanese motorcycle produced with a Wankel rotary engine. That, and its Giugiaro styling, make it one of the oddest and most collectible motorcycles of the 1970s. The 1974 RE5 is one of the JSAE &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;, and a 1976 model is in the AMA &quot;Motorcycle Hall of Fame&quot;.
* Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter uses electric-motor propulsion, powered by an air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell; its only emission is water. Following on a concept model at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, in 2011 the Burgman Fuel-Cell Scooter became the world&#x27;s first fuel-cell vehicle to earn Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) in the European Union, enabling the vehicle to be sold in all member states. Suzuki is working toward commercial production of this scooter.

===Concept motorcycles===

* Falcorustyco concept model at the 1985 Tokyo Motor Show envisaged the motorcycle technologies that might be brought into play by 1995, including a 4-cycle square 4-cylinder 500¬†cc engine, frameless body, front-and-rear swingarm suspension, center hub hydraulic power steering, chainless hydraulic drive and pop-up screen cowling.
* Nuda was a full-time two-wheel drive prototype, incorporating power steering and a swing seat, in a carbon fiber honeycomb monocoque body, shown at the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show. Nuda concepts influenced the design of the Suzuki Hayabusa.
* B-King ‚Äì The concept model was well received by the public when it went on display at the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. The addition of a turbocharger to the GSX1300R engine testified to massive power output, while electronics such as cellphone and GPS were stowed in the ultra-modern angular bodywork. The production model appeared six years later, largely unchanged except for its naturally aspirated engine. B-King styling is reflected in the award-winning design of the GSR600 and the GSR750, as well as the Inazuma GW250 and GW250S.
* G-Strider concept model with 916¬†cc engine, made public at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, was a half-scooter, half-cruiser (motorcycle) mash-up with an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission incorporating a push-button manual mode, similar to the Burgman 650. Accentuating luxury, the G-Strider&#x27;s handlebars, footrests, seat backrest, passenger backrest and windscreen were all electrically adjustable while under way to ensure the most comfortable riding position possible.
* Stratosphere prototype was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005, with an 1100¬†cc engine pushed to the limits of space-saving design, resulting in an in-line six-cylinder as wide as a conventional in-line four-cylinder engine. Hammered aluminum and Damascus steel incorporate material characteristics into styling design. Prospects for a production model seemed good, considering that Suzuki&#x27;s previous significant concept motorcycle, the B-King had made it into production, but the market changed before Stratosphere got the go-ahead.
* Biplane was a blue-sky concept announced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, designed to convey the joy of two-wheel mobility, inspired by the feeling of flying an airplane. Its shape generates a feeling of openness in a modern machine powered by a V-four engine.
* Crosscage concept model was displayed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Combining a high-performance secondary battery and a compact, lightweight air-cooled fuel-cell system from British specialist company Intelligent Energy enabled quick activation with low fuel consumption. The lithium-ion battery assured reserve power as well as minimal environmental impact. Light weight not only made this bike environment-friendly but also sporty.
* Gemma prototype model was introduced at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The distinctive &quot;full-flat 2-seater,&quot; 250¬†cc four-stroke single-cylinder scooter is low and sleek and gives the rider and passenger feel a greater sense of intimacy. The luggage compartment in front of the rider holds a helmet. Gemma went into production in Japan the following year for the domestic market.
* Recursion turbo parallel-twin middleweight, shown at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.

<text>The Norwegian Nobel Committee () selects the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize each year on behalf of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel&#x27;s estate, based on instructions of Nobel&#x27;s will.

Five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament. In his will, Alfred Nobel tasked the parliament of Norway with selecting the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. At the time, Norway and Sweden were in a loose personal union. Despite its members being appointed by Parliament, the committee is a private body tasked with awarding a private prize. In recent decades, most committee members were retired politicians.

The committee is assisted by its secretariat, Norwegian Nobel Institute. The committee holds their meetings in the institute&#x27;s building, where the winner is also announced. Since 1990, however, the award ceremony takes place in Oslo City Hall.

==History==
Alfred Nobel died in December 1896. In January 1897 the contents of his will were unveiled. It was written as early as in 1895. He declared that a Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded &quot;to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses&quot;, and that some of Nobel&#x27;s money was to be donated to this prize. The Nobel Foundation manages the assets. The other Nobel Prizes were to be awarded by Swedish bodies (Swedish Academy, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Karolinska Institutet) that already existed, whereas the responsibility for the Peace Prize was given to the Norwegian Parliament, specifically &quot;a committee of five persons to be elected&quot; by it. A new body had to be created‚Äîthe Norwegian Nobel Committee.

Jurist Fredrik Heffermehl has noted that a legislative body could not necessarily be expected to handle a judicial task like managing a legal will. The task of a parliament is to create and change laws whereas a will can not be changed unless the premises are clearly outdated. However, this question was not debated in depth, out of contemporary fear that the donated money might be lost in legal battles if the body was not created soon. On 26 April 1897 the Norwegian Parliament accepted the assignment and on 5 August the same year it formalized the process of election and service time for committee members. The first Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 to Henri Dunant and Fr√©d√©ric Passy. In the beginning, the committee was filled with active parliamentarians and the annual reports were discussed in parliamentary sessions. These ties to the Norwegian Parliament were later weakened so that the committee became more independent. Accordingly, the name was changed from the Norwegian Nobel Committee to the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament () in 1901, but changed back in 1977. Now, active parliamentarians cannot sit on the committee, unless they have explicitly stated their intent to step down shortly.

Nonetheless, the committee is still composed mainly of politicians. A 1903 proposition to elect a law scholar (Ebbe Hertzberg) was rejected. In late 1948, the election system was changed to make the committee more proportional with parliamentary representation of Norwegian political parties. The Norwegian Labour Party, which controlled a simple majority of seats in the Norwegian Parliament orchestrated this change. This practice has been cemented, but sharply criticized. There have been propositions about including non-Norwegian members in the committee, but this has never happened.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is assisted by the Norwegian Nobel Institute, established in 1904. The committee might receive well more than a hundred nominations and asks the Nobel Institute in February every year to research about twenty candidates. The director of the Nobel Institute also serves as secretary to the Norwegian Nobel Committee; currently this position belongs to Olav Nj√∏lstad.

<text>The Little Muskingum River is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately 65¬†mi (105¬†km) long, in southeast Ohio in the United States.

It rises in the hill country of Monroe County, approximately 5¬†mi (8¬†km) northwest of the Ohio River and 8¬†mi (13¬†km) southeast of Woodsfield. It flows southwest, in a tight meandering course, roughly parallel to, and staying within 8¬†mi (13¬†km) of the Ohio. It passes Rinard Mills and Dart, and joins the Ohio approximately 5¬†mi (8¬†km) southeast of Marietta, Ohio and the mouth of the Muskingum River, which enters the Ohio from the northwest. Duck Creek enters the Ohio between the mouth of the Muskingum and Little Muskingum.

All except the last 2¬†mi (3.2¬†km) of the river are within Wayne National Forest.

<text>John Gibson (May 23, 1740¬†‚Äì April 10, 1822) was a veteran of the French and Indian War, Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, the American Revolutionary War, Tecumseh&#x27;s War, and the War of 1812. A delegate to the first Pennsylvania constitutional convention in 1790, and a merchant, he earned a reputation as a frontier leader and had good relations with many Native American in the region. At age sixty he was appointed the Secretary of the Indiana Territory where he was responsible for organising the territorial government. He served twice as acting governor of the territory, including a one-year period during the War of 1812 in which he mobilized and led the territorial militia to relieve besieged Fort Harrison.

==Early life==
John Gibson was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on May 23, 1740, the son of George and Elizabeth de Vinez Gibson. Gibson&#x27;s father was born in Antrim, Ireland and came to Pennsylvania in 1730. The elder Gibson was a trader, who exchanged goods with the Conestogas who often met near his tavern in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. John Gibson&#x27;s mother Elizabeth was born in France and left that country because she was a Huguenot

Most of Gibson&#x27;s early life was spent along the Allegheny frontier where he was a merchant trader. He held local office in several counties as a judge, clerk, and sheriff. Although there is no record of his schooling, he was reputed to be well educated for his times.

In 1758, at age seventeen, he participated in the Forbes Expedition under General John Forbes against the French at Fort Duquesne as part of the French and Indian War. He remained at Fort Pitt after the war to engage in trade with Native Americans. He was captured by Lenape during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion while trading in the west and was condemned to be burnt, but escaped death when he was adopted by an old Indian woman whose son had died in battle. He remained with the Lenape tribe for some time. Later Gibson was freed as a result of the Boquet Expedition. After this Gibson returned to being an Indian trader. He built a house at Logstown which in 1772 was described as the &quot;only house there&quot; by the Reverend David McClure. Gibson married a relative of Mingo leader Logan and also learned to speak the Mingo language. Gibson&#x27;s wife and several other Mingo were murdered by a group of settlers in May 1774. Gibson&#x27;s daughter survived this incident, and was put into his care and he saw to her education. In 1774, he participated in Dunmore&#x27;s War and produced a written translation of Logan&#x27;s famous speech suing for peace: &quot;I appeal to any white man to say if he ever entered Logan&#x27;s cabin hungry and he gave him not meat.&quot;

==Revolutionary War==
In 1775, Gibson was made the Indian agent at Pittsburgh to represent the interests of Virginia, acting for John Connolly who in turn acted under Lord Dunmore. With war between the Colonists and England likely to start soon, Dunmore sent a letter to Connolly to contact White Eyes to convince him to join the British cause and fight the colonists. Connolly gave the letter to Gibson to take to White Eyes. However Gibson decided that the local committee of correspondence ought to see the letter, and with their receiving the letter processes were put in place that led to Connolly&#x27;s arrest on November 13, 1775, close to Hagerstown, Maryland. Gibson was also appointed a magistrate for Fincastle County, Virginia, which was at that time considered to include Pittsburgh by Connolly in 1775.

On May 16, 1775, Gibson was elected the colonel over the 6th Virginia.

In the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, Gibson was active in Indian negotiations. In early negotiations, Netawatwees requested that traders be sent to his village for him and his fellow Lenape to sell furs to. He specifically requested that Gibson be included among these men, describing Gibson as a &quot;good man&quot;. From October 1778 until January 1779 Gibson served as the agent to the tribes in what is today Ohio for the Continental Congress government.

Gibson commanded a regiment during the battles in New York and stayed in the theater until after the retreat through the Jerseys. He was then reassigned to command the army on the western front and left in command of forces at Fort Laurens during the harsh winter of 1778‚Äì1779, during which the fort was subjected to a siege by British and native forces. In the summer of 1779, Gibson was made the second in command to Daniel Brodhead. For a few months after Broadhead was removed in May 1781 Gibson was the commanding officer at Fort Pitt. Gibson had intended to send troops to support George Rogers Clark but the negative effects of Broadhead&#x27;s actions prevented Gibson from doing so.

In August 1781, Broadhead returned to claim control at Fort Pitt. He arrested Gibson accusing him of having usurped his authority. George Washington sent orders to Broadhead to step down from his command, and so he released Gibson and let him take over command again. Civilian authorities in the area then arrested Broadhead. In November 1781, David Williamson brought in some Moravian Lenapes captured in Salem, Schoenbrunn and Gnadenhutten, Ohio, to Fort Pitt. It is unclear if Gibson or William Irvine was in command when these Lenapes were released, but it seems that Gibson was at least blamed for this release. The problem was that after the release there were attacks on western Pennsylvania settlements. The fact that these were probably done by Half-King and his fellow Wyandots and not by the released Lenape was not factored into account by those who felt to denounce Gibson for this occurrence.

In January 1782, Irvine went to Philadelphia to meet with congress and left Gibson in charge. The enlisted men at Fort Pitt then threatened to mutiny, which may have contributed to the conditions that led to the Gnadenhutten Massacre, although it was only one of many factors involved in the situation. Irvine wrote &quot;a thousand lies are propagated against [Gibson] ‚Ä¶ occasioned by his unhappy connection with a certain trube, which leads people to imagine that he has an attachment to Indians in general.&quot;

==Life in Pennsylvania==
After the war Gibson returned to being a merchant but he went bankrupt, partly due to debts he had incurred in supporting the campaign of George Rogers Clark.

Gibson was a judge in Allegheny County from 1791 to 1800. He was also major-general and commanding officer of the militia for Allegheny County, and a member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1790. Gibson was also involved with the purchase of the area of the Erie Triangle from the Iroquois for the state of Pennsylvania.

==Indiana Territory==
U.S. President John Adams appointed Gibson to be secretary of the Indiana Territory in 1800, despite him being sixty years old. Gibson arrived in the territory in July of that year and took up his duties. For nearly a year he was the only government official in the territory and began organizing the government by appointing officers for the territorial militia. Governor William Henry Harrison did not arrive in the territory until January 1801 in which time Gibson served as acting-governor. One of his first acts as secretary was to conduct a census of the territory. It took him a full year of investigation to find that the population was slightly less than five thousand. After Harrison arrived in the territory, Gibson took on several more positions after being appointed justice of the peace, Knox County recorder, and a judge of the low court that tried misdemeanors and petty crimes. Gibson&#x27;s relationship with the local tribes proved invaluable to Harrison during the numerous treaty negotiations in the early part of his term. Gibson, who spoke several of the native languages, was the first to become aware of Tecumseh&#x27;s attempt to massacre the citizens of Vincennes in 1810 and was able to quickly and secretly gather together soldiers to prevent the situation from escalating.

He became acting-governor again in the summer of 1811, while Harrison was out of the territory. The American Indian Confederacy led by Tecumseh began to make aggressive movements and attacked Fort Harrison. Gibson called up the territorial militia and the Indiana Rangers, and organized several regiments to go to its aid. He was also instrumental in negotiating treaties with the Lenape and other tribes and preventing them from entering the war against the United States. Gibson remained acting governor once war was officially declared while Harrison led the army against the British and their native allies in the War of 1812. His final act as acting-governor was to oversee the move of the territorial capitol from Vincennes to Corydon following the reorganization of the territory by Congress. He returned to his secretary&#x27;s position in May 1813 when Thomas Posey arrived in the territory to assume the governorship. Gibson continued in the office of secretary until Indiana achieved statehood in 1816.

After completing his term in government, at age seventy-six Gibson and his wife Ann returned to private life, briefly remaining in Vincennes. He returned to live with his daughter and son-in-law, George Wallace, in Braddock&#x27;s Field near Pittsburg, where he died on April 10, 1822, at age eighty-two, having suffered two years from an &quot;incurable cataract&quot;. Gibson County, Indiana, was named in his honor.

<doc id="614627" wikidata="Q712914" url="?curid=614627" title="Jerry Reed">
<text>Jerry Reed Hubbard (March 20, 1937 ‚Äì September 1, 2008), known professionally as Jerry Reed, was an American country singer, guitarist, composer, songwriter and actor who appeared in more than a dozen films. His signature songs included &quot;Guitar Man&quot;, &quot;U.S. Male&quot;, &quot;A Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Alabama Wild Man&quot;, &quot;Amos Moses&quot;, &quot;When You&#x27;re Hot, You&#x27;re Hot&quot; (which garnered a Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male), &quot;Ko-Ko Joe&quot;, &quot;Lord, Mr. Ford&quot;, &quot;East Bound and Down&quot; (the theme song for the 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, in which Reed co-starred), &quot;The Bird&quot;, and &quot;She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)&quot;.

Reed was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. He was announced as an inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame in April 2017 and he was officially inducted by Bobby Bare on October 24.

==Early life==
Reed was born in Atlanta and was the second child of Robert and Cynthia Hubbard. Reed&#x27;s grandparents lived in Rockmart and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying &quot;I am gonna be a star. I&#x27;m gonna go to Nashville and be a star.&quot; Reed&#x27;s parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in foster homes or orphanages growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.

Reed graduated from O&#x27;Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O&#x27;Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to Georgia Tech and is now part of the university&#x27;s campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer Bill Lowery to cut his first record, &quot;If the Good Lord&#x27;s Willing and the Creek Don&#x27;t Rise&quot;.

At Capitol Records Reed was promoted as a new &quot;teen-age sensation&quot; after recording his own rockabilly composition &quot;When I Found You&quot; in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate Gene Vincent covered his song &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; in 1958.

By 1958, Bill Lowery signed Reed to his company, National Recording Corporation. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included Joe South and Ray Stevens, other NRC artists.

Reed married Priscilla &quot;Prissy&quot; Mitchell in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians (&quot;Bony Moronie&quot;, 1963), and with Roy Drusky was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 &quot;Yes, Mr. Peters&quot;.

==Career==
In 1959, Reed hit the Billboard &quot;Bubbling Under the Top 100&quot;, also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Joy&quot;. After serving two years in the U.S. Army, Reed moved to Nashville in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to Brenda Lee&#x27;s 1960 cover of his song &quot;That&#x27;s All You Got to Do&quot;. He also became a popular session and tour guitarist. In 1962, he scored some success with two singles &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; (as by Jerry Reed &amp; the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and &quot;Hully Gully Guitar&quot;, which found their way to Chet Atkins at RCA Victor, who produced Reed&#x27;s 1965 &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Live Up to It&quot;.

===&quot;Guitar Man&quot;===
In July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned &quot;Guitar Man&quot;, which Elvis Presley soon covered. Reed&#x27;s next single was &quot;Tupelo Mississippi Flash&quot;, a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first Top 20 hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was &quot;Guitar Man&quot;.

Reed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: &quot;I was out on the Cumberland River fishing, and I got a call from Felton Jarvis (then Presley&#x27;s producer at RCA Victor) He said, &#x27;Elvis is down here. We&#x27;ve been trying to cut &quot;Guitar Man&quot; all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.&#x27; I finally told him, &#x27;Well, if you want it to sound like that, you&#x27;re going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you&#x27;re using in the studio] are straight pickers. I pick with my fingers and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.&#x27;&quot;

Jarvis hired Reed to play on the session. &quot;I hit that intro, and [Elvis&#x27;s] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] &quot;U.S. Male&quot; at the same session. I was toppin&#x27; cotton, son.&quot; Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; (1967), recorded in the same session.

On January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Stay Away&quot;, and &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; (two songs revolving around Presley&#x27;s film &quot;Stay Away, Joe&quot;), as well as another Reed composition, &quot;U.S. Male&quot; (Reed&#x27;s quoted recollection of &quot;U.S. Male&quot; being recorded at the same session as &quot;Guitar Man&quot; being incorrect).

Presley also recorded two other Reed compositions: &quot;A Thing Called Love&quot; in May 1971 for his &quot;He Touched Me&quot; album, and &quot;Talk About The Good Times&quot; in December 1973, for a total of four.

Johnny Cash also released &quot;A Thing Called Love&quot; as a single in 1971. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio album that he released the following spring.

===1970s===
After releasing the 1970 crossover hit &quot;Amos Moses&quot;, a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart, Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP &quot;Me &amp; Jerry&quot;, which earned the pair the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper &quot;When You&#x27;re Hot, You&#x27;re Hot&quot;, which is a story song with most of the lyrics being spoken rather than sung. The song concerns the singer&#x27;s near success at shooting dice, a police raid, and a judge who is supposedly a fishing buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, &quot;When You&#x27;re Hot, You&#x27;re Hot&quot; earned Reed the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.

&quot;When You&#x27;re Hot, You&#x27;re Hot&quot; was the title track of Reed&#x27;s first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard&#x27;s Easy Listening chart. The singles from the album, &quot;Amos Moses&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Hot, You&#x27;re Hot&quot; sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs by the RIAA The album features songs such as Reed&#x27;s version of &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love to Town&quot; and John D. Loudermilk&#x27;s free-wheeling song &quot;Big Daddy (Alabama Bound)&quot;.

A second collaboration with Atkins, &quot;Me &amp; Chet&quot;, followed in 1972 as did a series of Top 40 singles which alternated between frenetic, straightforward country offerings and more pop-flavored, countrypolitan material. A year later he scored his second number one single with &quot;Lord, Mr. Ford&quot; (written by Deena Kaye Rose), from the album of the same name.

Atkins, who frequently produced Reed&#x27;s music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better fingerstyle player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Yakety Sax&quot;.

Reed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of Hanna‚ÄìBarbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Country Music Hall&quot; (prod. No. 61-10). He sang and played the song &quot;Pretty Mary Sunlight&quot;. The song is played throughout the episode as Scooby and the gang search for Reed&#x27;s missing guitar.

In the mid-1970s, Reed&#x27;s recording career began to take a back seat to his acting aspirations. In 1974, he co-starred with his close friend Burt Reynolds in the film &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot;. While he continued to record throughout the decade, his greatest visibility was as a motion picture star and almost always in tandem with headliner Reynolds; after 1976&#x27;s &quot;Gator&quot;, Reed appeared in 1978&#x27;s &quot;High-Ballin&#x27;&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;. He also co-starred in all three of the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; films; the first, which premiered in 1977, landed Reed a No. 2 hit with the soundtrack&#x27;s &quot;East Bound and Down&quot;.

In 1977, Reed joined entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country music stars including Conway Twitty, Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, and Richard Sterban, as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a minor league baseball team of the Double-A Southern League that began play in 1978.

He made two guest appearances on the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot;, in 1978 and 1981.

Reed also took a stab at hosting a TV variety show, filming two episodes of &quot;The Jerry Reed Show&quot; in 1976.

Scottish rockers The Sensational Alex Harvey Band released a version of &quot;Amos Moses&quot; in 1976.

In 1979, he released a record comprising both vocal and instrumental selections titled, appropriately enough, &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;. It was followed one year later by &quot;Jerry Reed Sings Jim Croce&quot;, a tribute to the late singer/songwriter. He also starred in a TV movie in that year entitled &quot;Concrete Cowboys&quot;.

===1980s and 1990s===
In January 1980, Reed began work on the &quot;Guitar Man&quot; re-recording being produced by Presley&#x27;s producer Felton Jarvis. With a new &quot;hopped up&quot; guitar line and Presley on lead vocals, the song reached number one on the country chart.

In 1982, Reed&#x27;s career as a singles artist was revitalized by the chart-topping hit &quot;She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)&quot;, followed by &quot;The Bird&quot;, which peaked at No. 2. Also in 1982, Reed headlined a syndicated TV special, &quot;Jerry Reed and Friends&quot;. The special, a &quot;music filled celebrity picnic&quot;, was filmed at the Hermitage Landing TN. It included guest stars Burt Reynolds, Louise Mandrell, Brenda Lee, Jimmy Dean, Glen Campbell, Vicki Lawrence, Faron Young and the Statler Brothers. Reed and Campbell performed the hit Southern Nights, with Campbell relating how the song&#x27;s guitar lick had been shown to him by Reed some years before.

His last chart hit, &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave&quot;, appeared in 1983. In the same year he co-starred with Robin Williams and Walter Matthau in the Michael Ritchie comedy &quot;The Survivors&quot;. Reed guest-starred in the October 13, 1983, episode of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;The Return of Leonard Oates&quot; (Episode 13, Season 2), as Naomi Harper&#x27;s ex-husband.

He accepted an invitation to open for the British group Dexys Midnight Runners in the US in 1984, yet left the tour early to appear on the country music comedy TV show &quot;Hee-Haw&quot;.

After an unsuccessful 1986 LP, &quot;Lookin&#x27; at You&quot;, Reed focused on touring until 1992 when he and Atkins reunited for the album &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Around&quot; before he again returned to the road. In the meantime, Reed appeared in several interviews and commercial spots for Mid-South Wrestling.

Reed had a role as a commander/Huey pilot for Danny Glover&#x27;s character in the 1988 movie &quot;Bat*21&quot; starring Gene Hackman. He also acted as executive producer and screenwriter on this film.

Reed starred in the 1998 Adam Sandler film &quot;The Waterboy&quot; as Red Beaulieu, the movie&#x27;s chief antagonist and the head coach for the University of Louisiana Cougars football team. Actor Henry Winkler recounts that Reed taught him how to bass fish while on location for this movie. It was Reed‚Äôs final film role before his death in 2008.

He teamed up with country superstars Waylon Jennings, Mel Tillis, and Bobby Bare in the group Old Dogs. They recorded one album in 1998, entitled &quot;Old Dogs&quot;, with songs written by Shel Silverstein. Reed sang lead on &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Job&quot; and &quot;Elvis Has Left The Building&quot;, the latter possibly in deference to Elvis helping launch his career.

In 1998, the American rock band Primus covered the Reed song &quot;Amos Moses&quot; on the EP titled &quot;Rhinoplasty&quot;.

===2000s===
In October 2004, &quot;Amos Moses&quot; was featured on the &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; soundtrack which played on the fictional radio station K-Rose. In 2007, the British band Alabama 3 (known as A3 in the U.S.) covered his hit &quot;Amos Moses&quot; on their album, &quot;M.O.R.&quot;

In June 2005, American guitarist Eric Johnson released his album &quot;Bloom&quot; which contained a track titled &quot;Tribute to Jerry Reed&quot; in commemoration of his works.

Reed appeared as a guest on the fishing television series &quot;Bill Dance Outdoors&quot;. In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big largemouth bass and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a taxidermist. Host Bill Dance objected to this plan and freed the fish when Reed was not looking. Reed became enraged when he discovered what had happened and chased Dance off the boat and to shore. This incident was mentioned in one of Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s stand-up comedy routines.

&quot;She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)&quot; was used in the 2010 film, &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;. It plays during the scene where Milo (Gerard Butler) searches Nicole&#x27;s (Jennifer Aniston) apartment.

&quot;You Took All the Ramblin&#x27; Out of Me&quot; was used in the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, on the radio station Rebel Radio.

&quot;Talk About the Good Times&quot; was used as the opening theme for the 2022 streaming TV series &quot;Sprung&quot; in all but the first episode. The entire song closed the final episode.

==Personal life and death==
Reed married country singer Priscilla Mitchell on July 9, 1959; they had two daughters (Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970), who also became country singers.

Reed died in Nashville on September 1, 2008, of complications from emphysema, at the age of 71. A week later, during their debut at the Grand Ole Opry, Canadian country rock group The Road Hammers performed &quot;East Bound and Down&quot; as a tribute. In a tribute in &quot;Vintage Guitar Magazine&quot;, Rich Kienzle wrote that &quot;Reed set a standard that inspires fingerstyle players the way Merle and Chet inspired him.&quot; He was survived by Mitchell and their two daughters. Mitchell died following a short illness on September 24, 2014, at the age of 73.

Reed was a heavy cigarette smoker. Thom Bresh, son of Merle Travis and a close friend of Reed&#x27;s, produced a 1990s video with Reed acting out his desire to quit smoking (&quot;Jerry Reed - Another Puff&quot;, which was his first 1972 released single) that serves as a public service video from Reed on the dangers of smoking cigarettes.

==Style and influences==

&quot;CMT&quot; called Jerry Reed &quot;a genuine original who helped take country music and the country lifestyle to a larger mainstream audience.&quot; Reed&#x27;s &quot;influence on American guitar playing is held by some to be comparable to that of Django Reinhardt, and several of his songs have become country rock standards&quot;, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;Rock Guitar For Dummies&quot; described Reed as one of the great rockabilly musicians. Reed&#x27;s syncopated guitar playing style was influenced by Merle Travis and Earl Scruggs; this style was nicknamed the &quot;claw&quot;, due to the appearance of Reed&#x27;s hand as he played. Reed&#x27;s guitar playing also showed the influence of the blues. Reed was also influenced by comedians, saying that he admired them as much as musicians. Reed&#x27;s vocal performances on some of his singles were also described as a prototype to rap vocals. Rapper Cowboy Troy said that Charlie Daniels and Jerry Reed&#x27;s vocal delivery &quot;was called recitations at that time, but if you listened to it now, you&#x27;d probably call it a rap&quot;. Brad Paisley said that he was influenced by Reed&#x27;s &quot;overall artistry and persona&quot;, as well as &quot;his total musicianship [...] anyone who picks a country guitar knows of his mastery of the instrument [...] [Reed was] one of the most inspirational stylists in the history of country music.‚Äù

<text>Air Tahiti Nui is the flag carrier of the French overseas collectivity of French Polynesia, with its head office and daily operations office in Fa ªa ªƒÅ, Tahiti. It operates long-haul flights from its home base at Faa&#x27;a International Airport, with a fleet consisting of four Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

== History ==
Air Tahiti Nui was established on 31 October 1996 and commenced flight operations on 20 November 1998. It was the first international long-haul airline based in French Polynesia, which was formed to develop inbound tourism. The Government of French Polynesia is the major shareholder (84.4%) along with other local investors. Air Tahiti Nui had 782 employees around 2007.

After years running a deficit, Air Tahiti Nui faced possible bankruptcy in 2011. The President of French Polynesia, Oscar Temaru, called for all eligible workers in the territory help bail out the carrier by voluntarily paying a third of their income into a rescue fund. After four years of deficit, the company started making profits again in 2015.

In May 2015, Air Tahiti Nui announced its intention to replace its entire fleet, then consisting of five Airbus A340-300 aircraft. They would be replaced by four Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which would be delivered in 2018 and 2019. Air Tahiti Nui operated its last A340 service in September 2019.
In April 2018, in anticipation of its new fleet of Boeing 787-9s, Air Tahiti Nui launched its redesigned brandmark and updated typography. The redesigned logo is a joint collaboration between Future Brand and Polynesian contemporary artist Alexander Lee. The re-drawn logo represents a tiare flower, the airline&#x27;s emblem from the start of its history, depicted in a two-thirds view, with the profile of a (woman, in Tahitian) in its pistil, a nod to Tahiti&#x27;s reputation for beautiful women and flowers in the South Seas.

In March 2020, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and as an impact of restrictions by the United States on international flights, Air Tahiti Nui operated the world&#x27;s longest domestic flight with a lightly loaded Boeing 787-9. The aircraft flew nonstop from Faa&#x27;a International Airport serving Papeete to Charles de Gaulle Airport serving Paris, skipping the then-restricted intermediate stop at Los Angeles International Airport, and traversing a great-circle distance of between the two airports, flying continuously for 15 hours 45 minutes. The airline&#x27;s flights between Papeete and Paris were later adjusted to make technical stops interchangeably between Pointe-√†-Pitre and Vancouver International Airport. Air Tahiti Nui&#x27;s record was later eclipsed by French Bee in May 2020, which operated its own flight from Papeete to Paris, but to Orly Airport, covering a great-circle distance of .

===Former fleet===

Air Tahiti Nui formerly operated the following aircraft:

===Livery===
Air Tahiti Nui&#x27;s aircraft livery over its history included different shades of blue representing the ocean, lagoon and sky of Tahiti for the upper half of the aircraft, extending the length of its fuselage, with white for the lower half as well as the aircraft&#x27;s engines. The flag of French Polynesia is placed toward the front of the aircraft, behind the cockpit windows, with the aircraft&#x27;s given name written underneath it. The flag is also incorporated into the livery&#x27;s design, with red and white stripes that extend for part of the fuselage&#x27;s length underneath the blue color. A tiare flower, the airline&#x27;s logo, is placed onto the aircraft&#x27;s vertical stabilizer (tailfin), with circular waves of alternating light and dark blues emanating from the flower, resembling water ripples.

With the introduction of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 787-9 aircraft in October 2018, the airline&#x27;s new livery incorporated markings derived from traditional Tahitian tattoos to the fuselage, the blue color used for most of the livery was changed to a darker shade, and the airline&#x27;s name written on the forward fuselage was changed to the airline&#x27;s new wordmark. However, despite the airline&#x27;s tiare flower logo undergoing a visual change during the airline&#x27;s overall rebranding, the logo used on the aircraft&#x27;s tailfin was largely unchanged from the previous version.
Air Tahiti Nui&#x27;s names for its aircraft are predominantly derived from various islands and atolls across French Polynesia, including Bora Bora, Fakarava, Mangareva, Moorea, Nuku Hiva, Rangiroa and Tetiaroa. An exception is F-ONUI, a Boeing 787-9 named after Tupaia, a historical Tahitian navigator.

<doc id="614642" wikidata="Q1428155" url="?curid=614642" title="Fletcher-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Fletcher&quot; class was a class of destroyers built by the United States during World War II. The class was designed in 1939, as a result of dissatisfaction with the earlier destroyer leader types of the and classes. Some went on to serve during the Korean War and into the Vietnam War.

The United States Navy commissioned 175 &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers between 1942 and 1944, more than any other destroyer class, and the design was generally regarded as highly successful. The &quot;Fletcher&quot;s had a design speed of and a principal armament of five guns in single mounts with ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple centerline mounts. The and classes were &quot;Fletcher&quot; derivatives.

The long-range &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class ships performed every task asked of a destroyer, from anti-submarine warfare and anti-aircraft warfare to surface action. They could cover the vast distances required by fleet actions in the Pacific and served almost exclusively in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, during which they accounted for 29 Imperial Japanese Navy submarines sunk. In a massive effort, the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s were built by shipyards across the United States, and, after World War II ended, 11 were sold to countries that they had been built to fight against: Italy, Germany, and Japan, as well as other countries, where they had even longer, distinguished careers. Three have been preserved as museum ships in the U.S. and one in Greece.

==Description==
The &quot;Fletcher&quot; class (named for Admiral Frank F. Fletcher, Medal of Honor recipient) was the largest destroyer class ordered. It was also one of the most successful and popular with their crews. Compared to earlier classes built for the United States Navy, the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s carried a significant increase in lethal firepower, including anti-aircraft (AA) weapons and increased armor plating; this contributed to greater displacement and overall weight and height increase. Their flush deck construction added structural strength; however, it did make them cramped, as less crew space was available below decks compared with a raised forecastle.

==Design==


The &quot;Fletcher&quot; class was the first generation of destroyers designed after the series of naval treaties that had limited ship designs heretofore. The growth in the design was in part a response to the challenge that had dogged U.S. Navy designs in coping with long range operations in the Pacific Ocean. They were also to carry no fewer than five guns and ten deck-mounted torpedo tubes on the centerline, allowing them to meet any foreign design on equal terms. Compared to earlier designs, the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s were large, allowing them to adapt to evolving defensive priorities through the addition of two Bofors quadruple mount AA guns as well as six Oerlikon dual AA gun positions. This addition to the AA suite required the deletion of the forward quintuple torpedo mount, a change done under the 4 April 1945 anti-&quot;kamikaze&quot; program.

&quot;Fletcher&quot;s were also much less top-heavy than previous classes, allowing them to take on additional equipment and weapons without major redesign. They were fortunate in catching American production at the right moment, becoming &quot;the&quot; destroyer design, with only the &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class derivatives, the and classes, following it.

The first design inputs were in the fall of 1939 from questionnaires distributed around design bureaus and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The design parameters were the armaments desired of the next destroyer. As such, the questions were of how many guns, torpedoes, and depth charges were seen as desirable. Also asked was at what point would the design grow large enough to become a torpedo target instead of a torpedo delivery system. The answer that came back was that five dual-purpose guns, twelve torpedoes, and twenty-eight depth charges would be ideal, while a return to the 1,500-ton designs of the past was seen as undesirable. Speed requirements varied from , and shortcomings in the earlier , which were top-heavy and needed lead ballast to correct this fault, caused the &quot;Fletcher&quot; design to be widened by of beam. As with other previous U.S. flush deck destroyer designs, seagoing performance suffered. This was mitigated by deployment to the Pacific Ocean, which is relatively calm compared to the Atlantic.

To achieve 38 knots with a 500-ton increase in displacement, power was increased from to compared to the previous and classes. The &quot;Fletcher&quot;s featured air-encased boilers producing steam at and , with two 350 kW steam turbine driven electrical generators and a 100¬†kW emergency diesel generator. Typically, Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and General Electric geared steam turbines were equipped, although other designs and manufacturers were probably used to maximize the rate of production.

==Armament==
Main gun armament was five dual-purpose 5-inch/38 caliber (127¬†mm) guns in single Mk 30 turrets (numbered bow-to-stern from one to five), guided by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System, including a Mk 12 fire control radar and a Mk 22 height-finder (replaced by the circular Mk 25 radar postwar) linked by a Mark 1A Fire Control Computer and stabilized by a Mk 6 8,500 rpm gyroscope.

Ten torpedo tubes were fitted in two quintuple mounts amidships, firing the 21-inch Mark 15 torpedo. Anti-submarine armament was two racks for depth charges at the stern and six K-gun 300-pound depth charge throwers amidships.

Anti-aircraft armament initially was light, with a quadruple 1.1&quot;/75 caliber gun located in an elevated tub between the number three and four 5-inch gun mounts and six Oerlikon 20¬†mm cannons (two in front of and below the bridge and four amidships). In June 1942, the 1.1&quot; gun was replaced by a twin Bofors 40¬†mm gun mount; in some ships, another twin mount may have been added on the fantail between the depth charge racks. In February 1943, the fantail-mounted Bofors was removed and one twin mount was placed on each side of the aft funnel, bringing the total number of 40¬†mm guns to six.

In 1942 and 1943, the number of Oerlikon cannons was steadily increased, with ships modified before leaving the shipyard with a seventh 20¬†mm mount in front of the bridge behind the number two 5&quot; gun mount and anywhere from one to three mounts on the flying bridge depending upon the configuration of the ship. In combat, commanders often requisitioned additional guns with some ships mounting up to thirteen 20¬†mm cannons. In June and July 1943, two more twin Bofors mounts were added in place of the 20¬†mm cannons in front of and below the bridge, giving a total of ten 40¬†mm barrels. With this modification, the Oerlikon cannons were rearranged and their number was standardized at seven; four amidships and three in a heart-shaped mount on the fantail.

Due to the increasing threat from &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, beginning in July 1945 some ships returning to the United States for refits received further anti-aircraft modifications. The forward set of torpedo tubes was removed, providing space to replace the two amidships twin 40¬†mm guns with two quadruple mountings (for a total of fourteen guns). The seven single 20¬†mm guns were replaced with six twin mounts (four amidships and two on the fantail.

Three (, and ) were modified during construction by deleting the rear torpedo tube mount and the number 3 5-inch gun mount and putting an aircraft catapult in the space. This alteration was not a success and was not repeated. These three destroyers were later converted to the regular &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class configuration.

==Service==
Nineteen &quot;Fletcher&quot;s were lost during World War II; a further six more were severely damaged, evaluated as constructive total losses, and not repaired. Postwar, the remainder were decommissioned and put into reserve. Of the 25 &quot;Fletcher&quot;s sunk or deemed as constructive total losses, 17 were lost between March and July 1945 off Okinawa.

===Korean War===
With the outbreak of the Korean War many were returned to active duty. During this time 39 were refitted under project SCB 74A, reducing their overall main armament and the number of torpedo tubes to accommodate other weapons. A new ahead-throwing weapon called Weapon Alpha was installed in many of the ships. Others carried trainable Hedgehogs. Eighteen ships were redesignated as escort destroyers (DDE), optimized for anti-submarine warfare; these reverted to destroyer (DD) designation in 1962.

==Other navies==
Many of the ships were sold to other navies during the mid-1950s, including:

Any remaining were broken up in the 1970s. The last &quot;Fletcher&quot; in service, BAM &quot;Cuitlahuac&quot; (ex-&quot;John Rodgers&quot;), left the Mexican navy in 2001, meaning the total service life of the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s stretched over almost six decades and into the 21st century.

==Surviving ships==
Four &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers are preserved as museum ships. Three are in the United States and one is in Greece, although only &quot;Kidd&quot; retains her World War II configuration.

&quot;Velos&quot; is the only vessel still in commission. &quot;Velos&quot; alongside &quot;G. Averof&quot; are ceremonially commissioned by the Hellenic Navy having Palaio Faliro as their base. Their crew are active Officers of Hellenic Navy. &quot;Velos&quot; still retains its complete armament and equipment (as modernized in 1950s). In September 2019 its crew took her to Thessaloniki for a short 3-month stay. , she remains in Thessaloniki and she has been visited by over 157.000 visitors.

All three American museum ships have been designated as National Historic Landmarks.

===Notes===
In 2018, &quot;Kidd&quot; was used as the filming location for the fictional USS &quot;Keeling&quot; DD-548 (codenamed &quot;Greyhound&quot;), from C. S. Forester&#x27;s novel &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;, in her appearance in the book&#x27;s 2020 cinematic adaptation, &quot;Greyhound&quot;.

On 14 April 2022, museum ship USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; sank at her pier in the Buffalo Naval Park. The depth of water prevented complete sinking. Since then, the ship has been refloated and restoration of the ship&#x27;s electric system and interior spaces is ongoing.

On 29 March 2023, the Museum of Antidictatorial Struggle HS &quot;Velos&quot; D-16 sustained damage caused by a storm while docked at Nea Paralia, Thessaloniki. Two tug boats were sent out to prevent further damage by holding her in place. After an investigation by the Ministry of Shipping, the damage was deemed non-threatening to the stability and durability of the ship. Similarly on 19 November 2023 strong gales caused its stern to slam onto the promenade of Nea Paralia resulting in the stern being breached. The day after repair operations began.

<text>In Roman religion, Terminus was the god who protected boundary markers; his name was the Latin word for such a marker. Sacrifices were performed to sanctify each boundary stone, and landowners celebrated a festival called the &quot;Terminalia&quot; in Terminus&#x27; honor each year on February 23. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was thought to have been built over a shrine to Terminus, and he was occasionally identified as an aspect of Jupiter under the name &quot;Jupiter Terminalis&quot;.

Ancient writers believed that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome during the reign of the first king Romulus (traditionally 753‚Äì717 BC) or his successor Numa (717‚Äì673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property. 

==Worship==
The name of the god Terminus was the Latin word for a boundary stone, and his worship as recorded in the late Republic and Empire centred on this stone, with which the god could be identified. Siculus Flaccus, a writer on land surveying, records the ritual by which the stone was sanctified: the bones, ashes, and blood of a sacrificial victim, along with crops, honeycombs, and wine, were placed into a hole at a point where estates converged, and the stone was driven in on top. On February 23 annually, a festival called the Terminalia was celebrated in Terminus&#x27; honor, involving practices which can be regarded as a reflection or &quot;yearly renewal&quot; of this foundational ritual. Neighboring families would garland their respective sides of the marker and make offerings to Terminus at an altar‚ÄîOvid identifies these, again, as crops, honeycombs, and wine. The marker itself would be drenched in the blood of a sacrificed lamb or pig. There followed a communal feast and hymns in praise of Terminus.

These rites were practised by private landowners, but there were also related public ceremonies. Ovid refers to the sacrifice of a sheep on the day of the Terminalia at the sixth milestone from Rome along the Via Laurentina; it is likely this was thought to have marked the boundary between the early Romans and their neighbors in Laurentum. Also, a stone or altar of Terminus was located in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Rome&#x27;s Capitoline Hill. Because of a belief that this stone had to be exposed to the sky, there was a small hole in the ceiling directly above it. On occasion Terminus&#x27; association with Jupiter extended to regarding Terminus as an aspect of that god; Dionysius of Halicarnassus refers to &quot;Jupiter Terminalis&quot;, and one inscription names a god &quot;Juppiter Ter.&quot;

There is some evidence that Terminus&#x27; associations could extend from property boundaries to limits more generally. Under the Republican calendar, when the intercalary month Mercedonius was added to a year, it was placed after February 23 or February 24, and some ancient writers believed that the Terminalia on February 23 had once been the end of the year. Diocletian&#x27;s decision in 303 AD to initiate his persecution of Christians on February 23 has been seen as an attempt at enlisting Terminus &quot;to put a limit to the progress of Christianity&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient views===
Ancient authors agreed that the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its introduction to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome&#x27;s founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753‚Äì717 BC), or to Romulus&#x27; successor Numa Pompilius (717‚Äì673 BC). Those authors who gave the credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus&#x27;s character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.

The stone in the Capitoline Temple was believed to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under Tarquinius Priscus (traditional reign 616‚Äì579 BC) or Tarquinius Superbus (535‚Äì510 BC). When the augurs took the auspices to discover whether the god or goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with Juventas the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as a good omen for the permanence of the city&#x27;s boundaries.

===Modern views===
According to the dominant scholarly view during the late 19th and much of the 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.

This view of Terminus retains some recent adherents, but other scholars have argued from Indo-European parallels that the personalised gods of Roman religion must have preceded the city&#x27;s foundation. Georges Dum√©zil regarded Jupiter, Juventas and Terminus as the Roman form of a proto-Indo-European triad, comparing the Roman deities respectively to the Vedic Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga. In this view the sovereign god (Jupiter/Mitra) was associated with two minor deities, one concerned with the entry of men into society (Juventas/Aryaman) and the other with the fair division of their goods (Terminus/Bhaga).

<text>Terminus is a space-flight role-playing action video game by Vicarious Visions. It was released in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple Macintosh. &quot;Terminus&quot; won awards in the 1999 Independent Games Festival for &quot;Technical Excellence&quot; and &quot;Innovation in Audio&quot;.

==Gameplay==
In Story mode, the player chooses one of four careers (United Earth League military, Mars Consortium militia, Marauder Pirate Clan, mercenary) and follows &quot;Terminus&quot;&#x27;s single-player storyline, set in the year 2197. In 2000, &quot;Terminus&quot; was unusual among RPGs in that the player&#x27;s actions can affect the ending of the storyline. Failing a mission, for example, may lead to a different ending than would have occurred if the mission had succeeded. One unique feature of &quot;Terminus&quot; is the story would progress with or without the player. The player could begin the game in story mode, then go off and do something else and the story missions/battles would still take place, reaching an outcome depending on which side eventually wins.

In Free mode, the player chooses a career and does the same as in Story mode, except there will be no storyline missions. In Gauntlet mode, the player outfits a ship with near-infinite money at their disposal, and faces several waves of attackers, with the object of staying alive for as long as possible.

==Development==
&quot;Polygon&quot; explained that Vicarious Visions&#x27; first major game &quot;following the publishing debacle during college&quot;, was the space combat role-playing video game &quot;Terminus&quot;. President Karthik Bala said &quot;We ended up getting a personal bank loan for a million dollars. We knew if we didn&#x27;t figure this out and make it work, we&#x27;d be screwed for the rest of our lives.&quot; The duo of developers had been left with a mountain of debt from development costs on Synnergist due to the publishers not giving them royalties for the game, and began work on this project on 1996.

Back in January 1998, the &quot;Vicarious Visions&#x27; seven full-time employees and squadron of contractors&quot; were laboring to complete the game, which at the time was to be the company&#x27;s second release. At that point &quot;The development budget for &quot;Terminus&quot; ha[d] already crossed the $250,000 mark with months&#x27; more work to be done before an expected September 1998 release.&quot; Bala said at the time &quot;&quot;Terminus&quot; will include not only network and Internet play, which is becoming almost standard in games, but also the capability for players to communicate by voice.&quot; Bala retrospectively said &quot;The Department of Defense had recently declassified an audio compression algorithm that we ended up using and writing Voice over IP within our game at the time. We did some really cool stuff primarily because it hadn&#x27;t been done.&quot; As a contest finalist at the first annual Independent Games Festival (the game ended up taking home two awards), &quot;&quot;Terminus&quot; was exhibited on the show floor at the Game Developers Conference, March 16‚Äì18 in San Jose, Calif.&quot; &quot;Polygon&quot; explained that despite winning some industry awards, &quot;publishers were reluctant to take on the project [and] when Vatival Entertainment finally shipped the game in 2000, it hardly sold.&quot; By 1999, the company employed 15 people, &quot;including four Rensselaer graduates and two undergrads&quot;.

&quot;Terminus&quot; is notable for its implementation of Newtonian laws of motion, which means that objects are subject to inertia. Once accelerated, they float indefinitely in one direction unless again accelerated into a different direction. This makes steering quite complicated, but mirrors actual behavior in free space. BarrysWorld explains &quot;The game has a newtonian (i.e &#x27;realistic&#x27;) flight model, that is to say that the ships will not fly like jet planes but they will actually obey the laws of Newtonian physics. In order to go in another direction you&#x27;ll need to slowdown to a stop and then go in the direction that you want to move in. All this will be accomplished by a kind of reaction control system autopilot that attempts to keep you moving in the direction you are pointing.&quot; The site added &quot;&quot;Terminus&quot; should be the first of a series of sims that will encourage &#x27;l33t&#x27; skillz to master.&quot;

Support for &quot;Terminus&quot; has long since ended. Although the game is still licensed by Vicarious Visions, the source code was licensed to the owner of the TerminusPoint website to allow continued development of the game and thus has been improved and enhanced. Although the client files are still available at the TerminusPoint website, the project has seemingly been abandoned.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, the game received above-average reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

&quot;PC Zone&quot; said, &quot;Overall, while not as flashy as other recent space-sims, &quot;Terminus&quot; has lots of substance. It packs so much into the game.&quot; &quot;GameSpy&quot; said, &quot;With &quot;Terminus&quot;, Vicarious Visions has raised the bar of excellence within three simultaneous genres, but couldn&#x27;t quite glue all the pieces together into a cohesive whole.&quot; &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Pulse&quot; said, &quot;In the end, &quot;Terminus&quot; failed to truly excite me. That&#x27;s not to say that the game isn&#x27;t fun to play; it does offer a good time to the pilot within us all.&quot; &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; said, &quot;When everything is said and done, &quot;Terminus&quot; comes out looking-and feeling-good.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Terminus&quot; offers flawed but nonetheless decent space combat action, along with an impressive online play feature. The game ought to be appealing on account of this and its cross-platform compatibility, but its glitches and general lack of polish considerably diminish its overall quality.&quot; &quot;MacADDICT&quot; called it &quot;an intermittently fantastic game that should appeal to flight-sim jockeys, hardcore sci-fi fans, and anyone who&#x27;s ever wanted to wield two joysticks.&quot;

<doc id="614657" wikidata="Q757370" url="?curid=614657" title="Sutta Pi·π≠aka">
<text>The Sutta Pi·π≠aka (also referred to as S≈´tra Pi·π≠aka or Suttanta Pi·π≠aka; English: &quot;Basket of Discourse&quot;) is the second of the three division of the Pali Tripitaka, the definitive canonical collection of scripture of Theravada Buddhism. The other two parts of the Tripi·π≠aka are the Vinaya Pi·π≠aka (&quot;Basket of Discipline&quot;) and the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka (&quot;Basket of Higher Doctrine&quot;). The Sutta Pitaka contains more than 10,000 suttas (teachings) attributed to the Buddha or his close companions.

==Origins==
What was later to become the written scripture of the &quot;Sutta Pitaka&quot; was first orally rehearsed by Buddha‚Äôs cousin ƒÄnanda at the First Buddhist Council that was held shortly after the Buddha&#x27;s death. The first council also defined the set of rules (Vinaya) that governed the life of monks and nuns within the monastic community. Tradition holds that little was added to the Canon after this. Scholars are more skeptical, but differ in their degrees of skepticism. Richard Gombrich thinks most of the first four nikayas (see below) go back to the Buddha, in content but not in form. The late Professor Hirakawa Akira says that the First Council collected only short prose passages or verses expressing important doctrines, and that these were expanded into full length suttas over the next century.

==Contents==

There are five nikayas (collections) of suttas:
# Digha NikƒÅya (), the &quot;long&quot; discourses.
# Majjhima NikƒÅya, the &quot;middle-length&quot; discourses.
# Sa·πÅyutta NikƒÅya (), the &quot;connected&quot; discourses.
# Anguttara NikƒÅya (), the &quot;numerical&quot; discourses.
# Khuddaka NikƒÅya, the &quot;minor collection&quot;.

=== Digha NikƒÅya ===

This includes &quot;The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness&quot;, &quot;The Fruits of the Contemplative Life&quot;, and &quot;The Buddha&#x27;s Last Days&quot;. There are 34 long suttas in this nikaya.

=== Majjhima NikƒÅya ===

This includes &quot;Shorter Exposition of Kamma&quot;, &quot;Mindfulness of Breathing&quot;, and &quot;Mindfulness of the Body&quot;. There are 152 medium-length suttas in this nikaya.

=== Samyutta Nikaya ===

There are, according to one reckoning, 2,889, but according to the commentary 7,762, shorter suttas in this Nikaya.

=== Anguttara NikƒÅya ===

These teachings are arranged numerically. It includes, according to the commentary&#x27;s reckoning, 9,565 short suttas grouped by number from ones to elevens. According to Keown, &quot;there is considerable disparity between the PƒÅli and the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin versions, with more than two-thirds of the s≈´tras found in one but not the other compilation, which suggests that much of this portion of the S≈´tra Pi·π≠aka was not formed until a fairly late date.&quot;

=== Khuddaka NikƒÅya ===

This is a heterogeneous mix of sermons, doctrines, and poetry attributed to the Buddha and his disciples. The contents vary somewhat between editions. The Thai edition includes 1-15 below, the Sinhalese edition 1-17 and the Burmese edition 1-18.

<text>Saint Leo University is a private Catholic university in St. Leo, Florida. It was established in 1889. The university is associated with the Holy Name Monastery, a Benedictine convent, and Saint Leo Abbey, a Benedictine monastery. The university and the abbey are both named for Pope Leo the Great, bishop of Rome from 440 to 461. The name also honors Leo XIII, who was Pope at the time the university was founded, and Leo Haid, then abbot of Maryhelp Abbey in North Carolina, now Belmont Abbey, who participated in founding the university and served as its first president.

The first Catholic college in Florida, Saint Leo is one of the fifteen largest Catholic colleges in the United States. It enrolls students at the traditional University Campus, and through its Center for Online Learning. University-wide, Saint Leo educates students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, three U.S. territories, and more than 80 countries. As of Spring 2017, total enrollment was 16,207 students, with 2,088 of those at University Campus. As of 2023, total enrollment is 9,523. 

Saint Leo was one of the first American universities to provide distance learning opportunities to students, beginning with educating military men and women in 1973 during the Vietnam era at the height of the anti-war movement. Saint Leo University offers more than 40 associate, baccalaureate, and master&#x27;s degrees, and certificate programs and inaugurated its first doctoral program in 2013. As of Fall 2016, the faculty included 219 full-time faculty and 1,157 fully qualified adjunct faculty members. In 2020, they had approximately 2000 employees.

==History==
Saint Leo traces its history to August 10, 1881, when Edmund F. Dunne, a former chief justice of the Arizona Territory, gained control of 100,000 acres in Florida. He established a Catholic colony in an area that is now the city of San Antonio and the town of St. Leo.

To accommodate a number of German-speaking colonists, John Moore, Bishop of the Diocese of St. Augustine, wrote the abbot of Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania to request a German-speaking priest. That request led to the Benedictine monks first arriving in the area. In 1888, Saint Vincent Archabbey transferred control of the colony to Mary Help of Christians Abbey (commonly called Maryhelp) in Belmont, North Carolina.

In February 1889, Leo Haid, Abbot of Maryhelp Abbey, accepted a gift from Edmund Dunne of 36 acres on Lake Jovita for the founding of a Benedictine College. That same month, Benedictine nuns arrived from Allegheny, Pennsylvania.

On March 11, 1889, they founded Holy Name Monastery. Saint Leo College and Saint Leo Abbey were founded on June 4, 1889. St. Leo College, the original name of the institution, opened its doors on September 14, 1890. The first student to arrive was 12 years old. He and six others were enrolled on the first day, and the student body grew to 32 for the 1890‚Äì1891 school year. The first five students graduated in June 1893 with Master of Accounts degrees.

In 1898, before it was legal in Florida for black and white students to attend school together, Saint Leo enrolled a black student‚ÄîRudolph Antorcha from Cuba. Today, he and the welcoming Benedictines are honored with a sculpture titled A Spirit of Belonging, which was dedicated at University Campus in 2013.

Over the years, the school went through a series of varying focuses and name changes: St. Leo&#x27;s College initially, then St. Leo Military College (1890‚Äì1903), St. Leo College (1903‚Äì17), St. Leo College Preparatory School (1917‚Äì18), Saint Leo College (1918‚Äì20), St. Leo College High School (1920‚Äì23), St. Leo Academy (1923‚Äì27), Benedictine High School (1927‚Äì29), Saint Leo College Preparatory School (1929‚Äì64), Saint Leo College (1959‚Äì99), and finally Saint Leo University (1999‚Äìpresent). During that time, it served as a military college within three different periods.

Saint Leo College Preparatory School operated from 1929 to 1964. In addition, Saint Leo returned to its college roots in 1959 and opened a junior college, with the first junior college graduates earning their associate degrees in 1961. The monks managed both the junior college and the prep school from 1959 to 1964. The Saint Leo College Prep School athletic teams were known as the Lions, and their colors were purple and gold. The Saint Leo College teams were known as the Monarchs, using green and gold as colors. In 1999, the Saint Leo athletic teams re-adopted the Lions name.

In 2011, Saint Leo University created an anthropomorphic lion mascot named Fritz. The name was a reference to a series of Saint Bernard dogs bearing that name, all owned by Charles Mohr, who served as the first abbot of Saint Leo Abbey from 1902 to 1931.

The Benedictine sisters at Holy Name Monastery, its neighboring community, closed their Holy Name Academy in 1963 and assisted Saint Leo, which transitioned to a four-year program.

Saint Leo College conferred its first bachelor&#x27;s degree on April 23, 1967, on 51 men and 13 women. The college was accredited by the Southern Educational Association that November, retroactive to the degree date.

In 1973, the college responded to requests from the armed services to offer degree programs on U.S. military bases. More education centers followed‚Äîon military bases, on community college campuses, and at stand-alone facilities‚Äîin seven states.

In 1998, the university&#x27;s Center for Online Learning was created, allowing students to take classes online from any location. 

The university announced plans in July 2021 to merge with Marymount California University, another private Catholic university. The transition was expected to be completed by January 2023. However, plans for the merger fell through after St. Leo University&#x27;s accreditor rejected its plans to acquire Marymount California University, and Marymount California University closed in August 2022. St. Leo University has since closed many of its satellite locations, eliminated 111 faculty/staff positions, cut three degree programs, and phased out six NCAA division II teams, facing continuing enrollment declines and financial issues.

Since 1959, when the junior college was started, Saint Leo has had 11 presidents: 
* John I. Leonard (1959‚Äì61)
* Stephen Herrmann (1961‚Äì68) 
* Anthony W. Zaitz (1968‚Äì70)
* Marion Bowman (1970‚Äì71)
* Thomas B. Southard (1971‚Äì85)
* M. Daniel Henry (1985‚Äì87)
* Frank M. Mouch (1987‚Äì96) 
* Arthur F. Kirk Jr. (1997‚Äì2015)
* William J. Lennox Jr. (2015‚Äì18)
* Jeffrey D. Senese (2018‚Äì2022)
* Edward Dadez (2022‚Äìpresent)

==Undergraduate admissions==
In 2024, Saint Leo University accepted 80.1% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered moderate, applicant competition considered very low,
and with those enrolled having an average 3.1 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, but they will be considered when submitted. Those enrolled students that submitted test scores had an average 1090 SAT score (8% submitting scores) or an average 23 ACT score (4% submitting scores).

==Awards and recognition==
Saint Leo was ranked #331-440 in the National Universities category in the 2022-23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges&quot; rankings. The University was also named #46 in the Top Performers on Social Mobility (tie).

In the 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges&quot; rankings, Saint Leo was named #26 overall in the Regional Universities South category. The school was also named #14 Best Colleges for Veterans and #4 Best Value School in the South Region.

Saint Leo was named a 2018 Best Regional University‚ÄìSouth and Best Value University‚ÄìSouth by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The school was also included in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s list of 2017 Best Online Bachelor&#x27;s Programs and Best Online Bachelor&#x27;s Programs for Veterans.

Saint Leo University was selected as one of the Best for Vets: Colleges 2017 by &quot;Military Times&quot;. The university was also named to the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for 2015 for measurable acts of community service by students, faculty, and staff.

In 2016, the university was named a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education, a designation jointly sponsored and approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The recognition is awarded through 2021.

===Accreditation===
The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award the associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, specialist, and doctoral degrees. The Saint Leo School of Business received initial accreditation by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education in September 1999. In 2014, accreditation was obtained from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

Saint Leo University&#x27;s degree program in social work is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Social Work Education (MSW, BSW and Bridge programs). The university&#x27;s undergraduate sport business program and MBA sport business concentration are accredited by the Commission on Sport Management Accreditation. The university has teacher education programs approved by the Florida Department of Education.

In December 2023, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges put Saint Leo University on probation due to ‚Äúfailing to meet financial standards and obligations and poor management of finances.‚Äù In December 2024, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges found Saint Leo University in compliance with regulations, removing their probationary status.

The Student Government Union (SGU) is the official student representative body on the campus. It has three branches: the SGU Executive Board, the SGU Senate, and the SGU Campus Activities Board. Saint Leo University&#x27;s SGU has implemented many projects and initiatives across campus that help students succeed with memories; most notably, being the Lion Statue at the school&#x27;s entrance (2018), Food Pantry (2018;2022),Scholarship Program (2018), and the Greek Street Benches (2024). Some of their most notable and recent former SGU members have been SGU President Ashley Butler, SGU President Derick McIntosh, SGU VPA Asley Tucker, and SGU VPO Khristian Parrish. Some of SGU&#x27;s current and former signature events included Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios, campus laser tag, Moonlight Breakfast, and a &quot;Spring Fling&quot; weekend featuring artists such as Lonestar, Everclear and Nick Hagelin from &quot;The Voice&quot;.

===Greek life===
There are currently seven fraternities and seven sororities on campus. Greek life is an active part of campus life. Chapters must meet requirements of a certain amount of social activities, educational programs, and philanthropy/community service each year. First-year students must wait until they have completed a semester before they may sign up for recruitment to join a Greek organization. The undergraduate chapters are only on the University Campus, but graduate students at learning centers may be able to join NPHC graduate chapters if their local area has them.

===Athletics===
Saint Leo University&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Lions. They participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division II in the Sunshine State Conference (SSC). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, and tennis; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, acrobatics and tumbling, volleyball and beach volleyball. The university discontinued men and women&#x27;s swim, track, and cross country programs in Spring of 2023 ‚Äúto help ensure the strength and long-term vitality of the university&#x27;s Athletics program and is a part of Saint Leo University&#x27;s larger efforts to streamline and focus its program offerings.‚Äù The school won its first NCAA Division II National Title in 2016 when the Lions&#x27; men&#x27;s golf team defeated Chico State, 3‚Äì2, in the NCAA DII Championship round at Green Valley Ranch Golf Club in Denver, Colorado as part of the 2016 NCAA Division II Spring Championships Festival. Saint Leo also played host to the 2016 NCAA Division II Cross Country Championships at The Abbey Course.

==Notable alumni and attendees==

Saint Leo University has produced thousands of alumni over the years, including Charles Henri Baker, a Haitian industrialist and presidential candidate; politicians Richard Corcoran and Ed Narain; Cerelyn J. Davis, Memphis Police Department Chief; George N. Turner, former Atlanta chief of police; musicians Stephen Stills and Desi Arnaz; Major League Baseball executive J. P. Ricciardi; Academy Award-winning actor Lee Marvin; and Major League Baseball player Bob Tewksbury.

==WLSL-LP FM 92.7==

In January 2014 Saint Leo University received a construction permit for a Low Power FM Station to operate on 92.7¬†MHz. The call sign is WLSL-LP (We Love Saint Leo).

The station&#x27;s studio facilities are located on University Campus with the transmitter and antenna facilities located at Pasco High School in Dade City. WLSL-LP covers the communities of Saint Leo, Dade City, and San Antonio and can be heard in a car radio as far north as Ridge Manor and south of Zephyrhills. The station was fully licensed on October 19, 2015.

<text>The farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a class of experimental cancer drugs that target protein farnesyltransferase with the downstream effect of preventing the proper functioning of the Ras (protein), which is commonly abnormally active in cancer.

==Background==
Studies have suggested that interference with certain post-translational modification processes seem to have quite a high selectivity for targeting cells displaying tumour phenotypes, although the reason for this is a matter of controversy.

After translation, Ras goes through four steps of modification: isoprenylation, proteolysis, methylation and palmitoylation. Isoprenylation involves the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) transferring a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the pre-Ras protein. Also, a related enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) has the ability to transfer a geranylgeranyl group to K and N-Ras (the implications of this are discussed below). Farnesyl is necessary to attach Ras to the cell membrane. Without attachment to the cell membrane, Ras is not able to transfer signals from membrane receptors.

==Development==
After a program of high-throughput screening of a class of drugs targeting the first step, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed. One FTI found in the screening was clavaric acid, a mushroom isolate. A number of molecules were found to have FTI activity. Some earlier compounds were found to have major side effects, and their development was discontinued. The others have entered clinical trials for different cancers. SCH66336 (Lonafarnib) was the first to do so, followed by R115777 (Zarnestra, Tipifarnib).

Unfortunately, the predicted &quot;early potential [of FTIs] has not been realised&quot;. The anti-tumour properties of FTIs were attributed to their action on Ras processing; however this assumption has now been questioned. Of the three members (H, N and K) of the Ras family, K-Ras is the form found most often mutated in cancer. As noted above, as well as modification by FFTase an alternative route to creation of biologically active Ras is through GGTase modification. When FFTase is blocked by FFTase inhibitors this pathway comes into operation ‚Äì both K and N-Ras are able to be activated through this mechanism. In recognition of this a joint administration of FTIs and GTIs was tried, however this resulted in high toxicity. It is in fact thought that the lack of FTI toxicity may be due to a failure to fully inhibit Ras: FTIs actually target normal cells but alternative pathway allow these cells to survive (Downward J, 2003).

==Explaining success==
It has been suggested that the preclinical successes showing that many N- or K-Ras transformed cell lines (and even tumor cell lines that do not harbor Ras mutations) are sensitive to FTase inhibitors due to inhibition of farnesylation of a number of other proteins. Therefore, it is hoped that FTIs, whilst not Ras specific, still have potential for cancer therapy.

==Investigation for alternative uses==

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

LNK-754 inhibits the activity of a protein called farnesyl-transferase (FT). This class of molecules are called FTIs (or farnesyl-transferase inhibitors). As with mTOR inhibitors, many companies developed them to treat cancers, where they were unsuccessful. The mechanism by which FTIs work is through inhibition of this enzyme, which adds a fatty acid molecule to proteins (such as the oncogene, or cancer-generating, ras). Many proteins can exist in a cell in various locations, and the addition of a farnesyl group targets proteins to the plasma membrane. When ras gets to the plasma membrane, it becomes activated, and leads to tumour formation if this process is not stopped. It was thought that by inhibiting FT, ras will not be activated, therefore preventing cancer growth. The problem was that ras can also be modified by other mechanisms, and thus FTIs were not sufficient to inhibit malignant growth induced by ras signaling.

Most FTIs also have side effects (since they also indirectly affect mTOR), and their development for HD would likely not be successful. However, the remarkable finding is that Link Medicine has developed an FTI which does NOT affect mTOR signaling. This is a novel and important molecule, and might have higher probability to be of use for long term chronic diseases such as HD.

However, as with any new approach, it is too early yet to see if it will be safe in longer trials, and effective in people. But there is much room for hope, as this represents a completely novel mechanism to evaluate in people. If autophagy mechanisms in humans are similar as those of mice, then there is much reason for optimism. Lets hope for continued success for Link Medicine, so that it will be safe and the lead molecule progresses to the stage of being tested in HD subjects.

===Protozoan parasites===
FTIs can also be used to inhibit farnesylation in parasites such as &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; (African sleeping sickness) and &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; (malaria). These parasites seem to be more vulnerable to inhibition of Farnesyltransferase than humans, even though the drugs tested selectively target human FTase. In some cases the reason for this may be the parasites lack Geranylgeranyltransferase I. This vulnerability may pave the way for the development of selective, low toxicity, FTI based anti-parasitic drugs &#x27;piggybacking&#x27; on the development of FTIs for cancer research.

===Use in progeria===

Studies have been published indicating that farnesyltransferase inhibitors such as lonafarnib a synthetic tricyclic derivative of carboxamide with antineoplastic properties can reverse instability of nuclear structure due to the genetic mutation of the LMNA gene. The drug has been used to treat children suffering from Hutchinson‚ÄìGilford progeria syndrome.
Results of the first-ever clinical drug trial for children with progeria, demonstrated the efficacy of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI).

<doc id="614691" wikidata="Q7752174" url="?curid=614691" title="The Moon of Gomrath">
<text>The Moon of Gomrath is a fantasy story by the author Alan Garner, published in 1963. It is the sequel to &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==
Once again, it details the involvement of two children, Colin and Susan, with the world of myth and magic. This time the focus is on the potential of the older, wilder forms of magic and myth cycle to create both creative and destructive forces on the world.

To ease the surrender of the Weirdstone in &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, Susan was given a magical bracelet by Angharad Goldenhand. It is the donning of this bracelet which has launched Susan unwittingly on a destiny connected with the cycles of the moon and hence the older wilder powers of the world. &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot; begins when the elves (lios-alfar) borrow the bracelet, with her consent, to see if its power can be directed by them to battle an unknown evil power in their own lands in Sinadon. However while unprotected by the bracelet, Susan is possessed by the Brollachan, an ancient evil released after an old pit is broken open during building work. The wizard Cadellin, guardian of the sleeping knights in &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, cannot restore Susan after the Brollachan has been driven out of her body; instead perceiving that her spirit has been driven to another spiritual dimension, unreachable with ordinary means. It is Colin&#x27;s true-hearted heroic love and need for his sister which provides the answer; as he responds to the older powers of the world. He therefore comes to seek the Mothan at moonrise. The Mothan is a mythical plant which grows on the Old Straight Track. This is a motif inspired by the book named &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot;. It is part of the Old Magic, in contrast to Cadellin&#x27;s High Magic. Susan is dramatically restored to her own body.

However, her sojourn to other levels of existence has sensitised her to the powers with which she and her brother have been coming to associate and the story takes a new dramatic turn. On walking home across the Edge on dusk, they are inspired to build a fire to keep warm, Susan almost manically so. This fire includes rowan and pine which unintendedly act as a wendfire, which on this night of the year has the power to call ancient spirits from their mounds. Colin and Susan release the Wild Hunt, which return several times during the course of the novel.

While they are trying to undo what they have done, the Morrigan captures Colin and imprisons him in Errwood Hall, which her magic restores into a building, which except in moonlight teleports into a lightless magic realm. This sets up the denouement, a pitched battle between the forces of the Morrigan (goblin-like bodachs and wildcat palugs) and Susan&#x27;s allies (the lios-alfar, the dwarf Uthecar, and man Albanac), both willing and unwilling. Although Colin is rescued, Albanac is killed. When the elves withdraw their support as a lost cause, the Morrigan finally releases the Brollachan, focusing it on Susan to destroy her growing potential as a force for good. It is the other gift from Angharad Goldenhand which saves the day and the Old Magic is set free forever.

==Background==
Garner provides a sidelight on his authorial approach by including an appendix of books which inspired him, along with a brief discussion of his approach to mythology.

Garner repeatedly refused to write a third, despite persistent requests, claiming that this would actually diminish the emotional power of the first two books and that his material, interests and style have moved on long ago. However &quot;Boneland&quot;, the conclusion to the sequence, was finally published in August 2012.

<doc id="614697" wikidata="Q425201" url="?curid=614697" title="Bcl-2">
<text>Bcl-2, encoded in humans by the BCL2 gene, is the founding member of the Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins. BCL2 blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis) while other BCL2 family members can either inhibit or induce it. It was the first apoptosis regulator identified in any organism.

Bcl-2 derives its name from &quot;B-cell lymphoma 2&quot;, as it is the second member of a range of proteins initially described in chromosomal translocations involving chromosomes 14 and 18 in follicular lymphomas. Orthologs (such as &quot;Bcl2&quot; in mice) have been identified in numerous mammals for which complete genome data are available.

Like BCL3, BCL5, BCL6, BCL7A, BCL9, and BCL10, it has clinical significance in lymphoma.

== Isoforms ==

The two isoforms of Bcl-2, Isoform 1, and Isoform 2, exhibit a similar fold. However, results in the ability of these isoforms to bind to the BAD and BAK proteins, as well as in the structural topology and electrostatic potential of the binding groove, suggest differences in antiapoptotic activity for the two isoforms.

== Function ==

BCL-2 is localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria, where it plays an important role in promoting cellular survival and inhibiting the actions of pro-apoptotic proteins. The pro-apoptotic proteins in the BCL-2 family, including Bax and Bak, normally act on the mitochondrial membrane to promote permeabilization and release of cytochrome c and ROS, that are important signals in the apoptosis cascade. These pro-apoptotic proteins are in turn activated by BH3-only proteins, and are inhibited by the function of BCL-2 and its relative BCL-Xl.

There are additional non-canonical roles of BCL-2 that are being explored. BCL-2 is known to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission. Additionally, in pancreatic beta-cells, BCL-2 and BCL-Xl are known to be involved in controlling metabolic activity and insulin secretion, with inhibition of BCL-2/Xl showing increasing metabolic activity, but also additional ROS production; this suggests it has a protective metabolic effect in conditions of high demand.

== Role in disease ==
Damage to the Bcl-2 gene has been identified as a cause of a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, prostate, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lung cancer, and a possible cause of schizophrenia and autoimmunity. It is also a cause of resistance to cancer treatments.

===Cancer===
Cancer can be seen as a disturbance in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes ‚Äì t(14;18) ‚Äì which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis. Bcl-2 expression is frequent in small cell lung cancer, accounting for 76% cases in one study.

===Auto-immune diseases===
Apoptosis plays an active role in regulating the immune system. When it is functional, it can cause immune unresponsiveness to self-antigens via both central and peripheral tolerance. In the case of defective apoptosis, it may contribute to etiological aspects of autoimmune diseases. The autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes can be caused by defective apoptosis, which leads to aberrant T cell AICD and defective peripheral tolerance. Due to the fact that dendritic cells are the immune system&#x27;s most important antigen-presenting cells, their activity must be tightly regulated by mechanisms such as apoptosis. Researchers have found that mice containing dendritic cells that are Bim -/-, thus unable to induce effective apoptosis, have autoimmune diseases more so than those that have normal dendritic cells. Other studies have shown that dendritic cell lifespan may be partly controlled by a timer dependent on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2.

=== Other ===

Apoptosis plays an important role in regulating a variety of diseases. For example, schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder in which an abnormal ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors may contribute towards pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that this may result from abnormal expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of caspase-3.

== Diagnostic use ==

Antibodies to Bcl-2 can be used with immunohistochemistry to identify cells containing the antigen. In healthy tissue, these antibodies react with B-cells in the mantle zone, as well as some T-cells. However, positive cells increase considerably in follicular lymphoma, as well as many other forms of cancer. In some cases, the presence or absence of Bcl-2 staining in biopsies may be significant for the patient&#x27;s prognosis or likelihood of relapse.

== Targeted therapies ==

Targeted and selective Bcl-2 inhibitors that have been in development or are currently in the clinic include:

===Oblimersen===
An antisense oligonucleotide drug, oblimersen (G3139), was developed by Genta Incorporated to target Bcl-2. An antisense DNA or RNA strand is non-coding and complementary to the coding strand (which is the template for producing respectively RNA or protein). An antisense drug is a short sequence of modified DNA that hybridises with and inactivates mRNA, preventing the protein from being formed.

Human lymphoma cell proliferation (with t(14;18) translocation) could be inhibited by antisense oligonucleotide targeted at the start codon region of Bcl-2 mRNA. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies led to the identification of Genasense, which is complementary to the first 6 codons of Bcl-2 mRNA.

These showed successful results in Phase I/II trials for lymphoma. A large Phase III trial was launched in 2004. As of 2016, the drug had not been approved and its developer was out of business.

===ABT-737 and navitoclax (ABT-263)===

In the mid-2000s, Abbott Laboratories developed a novel inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, known as ABT-737. This compound is part of a group of BH3 mimetic small molecule inhibitors (SMI) that target these Bcl-2 family proteins, but not A1 or Mcl-1. ABT-737 is superior to previous BCL-2 inhibitors given its higher affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies showed that primary cells from patients with B-cell malignancies are sensitive to ABT-737.

In animal models, it improves survival, causes tumor regression and cures a high percentage of mice. In preclinical studies utilizing patient xenografts, ABT-737 showed efficacy for treating lymphoma and other blood cancers. Because of its unfavorable pharmacologic properties ABT-737 is not appropriate for clinical trials, while its orally bioavailable derivative navitoclax (ABT-263) has similar activity on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and has entered clinical trials. While clinical responses with navitoclax were promising, mechanistic dose-limiting thrombocytopenia was observed in patients under treatment due to Bcl-xL inhibition in platelets.

===Venetoclax (ABT-199)===
Due to dose-limiting thrombocytopenia of navitoclax as a result of Bcl-xL inhibition, Abbvie successfully developed the highly selective inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199), which inhibits Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xL or Bcl-w. Clinical trials studied the effects of venetoclax, a BH3-mimetic drug designed to block the function of the Bcl-2 protein, on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Good responses have been reported and thrombocytopenia was no longer observed. A phase 3 trial started in Dec 2015.
It was approved by the US FDA in April 2016 as a second-line treatment for CLL associated with 17-p deletion. This was the first FDA approval of a BCL-2 inhibitor. In June 2018, the FDA broadened the approval for anyone with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, with or without 17p deletion, still as a second-line treatment.

===Sonrotoclax (BGB-11417)===
Venetoclax drug resistance has been noted with the G101V mutation in BCL-2 observed in relapsing patients. Sonrotoclax shows greater tumor growth inhibition in hematologic tumor models than venetoclax and inhibits venetoclax-resistant BCL-2 variants. Sonrotoclax is under clinical investigation as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents.

<text>A chandelier () is an ornamental lighting device, typically with spreading branched supports for multiple lights, designed to be hung from the ceiling. Chandeliers are often ornate, and they were originally designed to hold candles, but now incandescent light bulbs are commonly used, as well as fluorescent lamps and LEDs.

A wide variety of materials ranging from wood and earthenware to silver and gold can be used to make chandeliers. Brass is one of the most popular with Dutch or Flemish brass chandeliers being the best-known, but glass is the material most commonly associated with chandeliers. True glass chandeliers were first developed in Italy, England, France, and Bohemia in the 18th century. Classic glass and crystal chandeliers have arrays of hanging &quot;crystal&quot; prisms to illuminate a room with refracted light. Contemporary chandeliers may assume a more minimalist design, and they may illuminate a room with direct light from the lamps or are equipped with translucent glass shades covering each lamp. Chandeliers produced nowadays can assume a wide variety of styles that span modernized and traditional designs or a combination of both.

Although chandeliers have been called candelabras, chandeliers can be distinguished from candelabras which are designed to stand on tables or the floor, while chandeliers are hung from the ceiling. They are also distinct from pendant lights, as they usually consist of multiple lamps and hang in branched frames, whereas pendant lights hang from a single cord and only contain one or two lamps with few decorative elements. Due to their size, they are often installed in large hallways and staircases, living rooms, lounges, and dining rooms, often as focus of the room. Small chandeliers can be installed in smaller spaces such as bedrooms or small living spaces, while large chandeliers are typically installed in the grand rooms of buildings such as halls and lobbies, or in religious buildings such as churches, synagogues or mosques.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;chandelier&quot; was first known in the English language in the sense as used today in 1736, borrowed from the word in French that means a candleholder. It may have been derived from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;tallow candle&quot;, or &quot;chandelabre&quot; in Old French and &quot;&quot; in Latin, and ultimately from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;candle&quot;. In the earlier periods, the term &quot;candlestick&quot;, &quot;chandelier&quot; in France, may be used to refer to a candelabra, a hanging branched light, or a wall light or sconce. In English, &quot;hanging candlesticks&quot; or &quot;branches&quot; were used to mean lighting devices hanging from the ceiling until chandelier began to be used in the 18th century.

In France, &quot;chandelier&quot; still means a candleholder, and what is called chandelier in English is &#x27; in French, a term first used in the late-17th century. The French &quot;lustre&quot;, from Italian &#x27;, can also be used in English to mean a chandelier hung with crystals, or the glass pendant used to decorate such chandelier. The use of words for indoor lighting objects can be confusing, and a number of terms like lustres, branches, chandeliers and candelabras were used interchangeably at various times, which can make the early appearance of these words misleading. Girandole was also once used to refer to all candelabra as well as chandelier, although girandole now usually means an ornate branched candleholder that may be mounted on a wall, often with a mirror. Chandeliers may sometimes be called suspended lights, although not all suspended lights are necessarily chandeliers.

==History==
===Precursors===

Hanging lighting devices, some described as chandeliers, were known since ancient times, and circular ceramic lamps with multiple points for wicks or candles were used in the Roman period. The Roman terms &#x27; or &#x27;, however, can refer to candlestick, floor lamps, candelabra, or chandelier. By the 4th century, terms such as &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;pharicanthari&quot; were used, and they were often mentioned as presents of the popes.
In the Byzantine period, flat circular metallic structures suspended with chains that can hold oil lamps known as polycandela (singular polycandelon) were commonly used throughout the eastern Mediterranean. First developed in late antiquity, polycandela were used in churches and synagogues, and took the shape of a bronze or iron frame holding a varying number of globular or conical glass beakers provided with a wick and filled with oil. They may be hung between columns, over the altar or tombs of saints. Polycandela were also commonly used to furnish households up until the 8th century.

Hanging lamps were commonly found in mosques in Islamic countries, while sanctuary lamps were found in churches. In Spain which had significant Moorish influence, hanging farol lanterns made of pierced brass and bronze as well as glass were produced. A type of Spanish silver &quot;lampadario&quot; with an elongated central reservoir for oil may have developed into a form of chandelier that has a central baluster and branching arms.
The early form of hanging lighting devices in religious buildings may be of considerable size. Huge hanging lamps in Hagia Sophia were described by Paul the Silentiary in 563: &quot;And beneath each chain he has caused to be fitted silver discs, hanging circle-wise in the air, round the space in the center of the church. Thus these discs, pendant from their lofty courses, form a coronet above the heads of men. They have been pierced too by the weapon of the skillful workman, in order that they may receive shafts of fire-wrought glass and hold light on high for men at night.&quot; In the late 8th century, Pope Adrian I was said to have presented the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica with a chandelier that could hold 1,370 candles, while his successor Pope Leo III presented a golden corona decorated with jewels to the Basilica of St. Andrew. The Venerable Bede mentioned that it was customary to have two hanging lighting devices called &quot;phari&quot; in a major English church, one in the nave and one in the choir, which may be a large bronze hoop with lamps hung over the figure of a cross.

===Early chandeliers===

In the medieval period, circular crown-shaped hanging devices made of iron called the corona (&quot;couronne de lumi√®re&quot; in France and &quot;corona de luz&quot; in Spain) were used in many European countries in religious buildings since the 9th century. The larger Romanesque or Gothic-style circular wheel chandeliers were also recorded in Germany, France, and the Netherlands in the 11th and 12th century. Four Romanesque wheel chandeliers survive in Germany, including to be the Azelin and Hezilo chandeliers in Hildesheim Cathedral, and the Barbarossa Chandelier in the Aachen Cathedral. These large structures may be considered the first true chandeliers. These chandeliers have prickets (vertical spikes for holding candles) and cups for oil and wicks. A hammered iron corona with floral decorated was recorded in the St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London in the 13th century. The iron chandeliers may have polychrome paint as well as jewel and enamelwork decorations.
Wooden cross-beam chandeliers were the early form of chandelier used in a domestic setting and they were found in the households of the wealthy in the medieval period. The wooden cross beams were attached to a vertical wooden pillar, and on each of the four arms a candle may be placed. Some that could hold two candles in each arm were called &quot;double candlesticks&quot;. While simple in design compared to later chandeliers, such wooden chandeliers were still found in the court of Charles VI of France in the 15th century and a double candlestick was listed in the inventory of the estate of Henry VIII of England in the 16th century. In the medieval period, chandeliers may also be lighting devices that could be moved to different rooms. In later periods, wood used in chandeliers may be carved and gilded.

By the late Gothic period, more complex forms of chandeliers appeared. Chandeliers with many branches radiating out from a central stem, sometimes in tiers, were made by the 15th century, and these may be adorned with statuettes and foliated decorations. Chandelier became popular decorative features in palaces and homes of nobility, clergy and merchants, and their high cost made chandeliers symbols of luxury and status. A diverse range of materials were also employed in the making of chandeliers. In Germany, a form of chandeliers made of deer antlers and wooden sculpted figures called lusterweibchen were known to have been made since the 14th century. Ivory chandeliers in the palace of the king of Mutapa, were depicted in a 17th-century description by Olfert Dapper. Porcelain introduced to Europe were also used to make chandeliers in the 18th century.

===Brass chandelier===

Many different metallic materials have been used to make chandeliers, including iron, pewter, bronze, or more prestigiously silver and even gold. Brass, however, has the warm appearance of gold while being considerably cheaper, and also easy to work with, it therefore became a popular choice for making chandeliers. Brass or brass-like latten has been used to make chandeliers since the medieval period, and many were made with brass-type alloy from Dinant (now in Belgium, brass ware from the town was known as &quot;dinanderie&quot;) until the mid-15th century. The metal chandeliers may have a central support with curved or S-shaped arms attached, and at the end of each arm is a drip-pan and nozzle for holding a candle; by the 15th century, candle nozzles were used instead of prickets to hold the candles since candle production techniques allowed for the production of identically sized candles. Many such brass chandeliers can be seen depicted in Dutch and Flemish paintings from the 15th to 17th centuries. These Dutch and Flemish chandeliers may be decorated with stylized floral embellishments as well as Gothic symbols and emblems and religious figures. Large numbers of brass chandeliers existed, but most of the early brass chandeliers did not survive destruction during the Reformation.
The Dutch brass chandeliers have distinctive features ‚Äì a large brass sphere at the end of a central ball stem, and six curved low-swooping arms. The globe helps to keep the chandelier upright and reflect the light from candles, and the arms are curved downward to bring the candles to the level of the sphere to allow for maximum reflection. The arms of early brass chandeliers may also have drooped lower through use over time as the brass used in the earlier period was softer due to lower zinc content. Many Dutch chandeliers were topped by a double-headed eagle by the 16th century. The features of Dutch brass chandeliers were widely copied in other countries, and this form is arguably the most successful and long-lasting of all types of chandeliers. Dutch brass chandeliers were popular across Europe, particularly in England, as well as in the United States. Variations of the Dutch brass chandelier were produced, for example there may be multiple tiers of the arms, the sphere may become elongated, or the arms may emerge from the globe itself. By the early 18th century, ornate cast ormolu forms with long, curved arms and many candles were in the homes of many in the growing merchant class.

===Glass and crystal chandeliers===
Chandeliers began to be decorated with carved rock crystal (quartz) of Italian origin in the 16th century, a highly expensive material. The rock crystal pieces were hung from a metal frame as pendants or drops. The metal frame of French chandeliers may have a central stem onto which arms are attached, later some may form a cage or &quot;birdcage&quot; without a central stem. Few, however, could afford these rock crystal chandeliers as they were costly to produce. In the 17th century multi-faceted crystals that could reflect light from the candles were used to decorate chandelier and they were called &quot;chandeliers de crystal&quot; in France. The chandeliers produced in France in the 17th century were in the French Baroque style, and rococo in the 18th century. French rock crystal chandeliers found their finest expression under Louis XIV, as exemplified by chandeliers at the Palace of Versailles.
Rock crystal began to be replaced by cut glass in the late 17th century. and examples of chandeliers made with rock crystal as well as Bohemian glass can be found in the Palace of Versailles. Crystal chandeliers in the early period were literally made of crystals, but what are called crystal chandeliers now are almost always made of cut glass. Glass, although not crystalline in structure, continued to be called crystal, after much clearer cut glass that resembled crystal was produced from the late 17th-century. Quartz is nevertheless still more reflective than the best glass, and lead glass that is perfectly clear was not produced until 1816. Although France is believed to have produced lead glass in the late-17th century, France used imported glass for its chandeliers until the late 18th century when high quality glass was produced in the country.

The origin of the glass chandelier is unclear, but some scholars believed that the first glass chandelier was made in 1673 in Orl√©ans France, where a simple iron rod was encased in multi-coloured glass with glass arms attached. By the turn of the 18th century, glass chandeliers were produced in France, England, Bohemia, and Venice. In Britain, Lead glass was developed by George Ravenscroft 1675, which allowed for the production of cheaper lead crystal that resembles rock crystal without the crisseling defects of other glass. It is also relatively soft compared to soda glass, allowing it to be cut or faceted without shattering. Lead glass also rings when struck, unlike soda glass which has no resonance. The clearness and light scattering properties of lead glass made it a popular addition to the form, and conventionally, lead glass may be the only glass that can be described as crystal. The first mention of a glass chandelier in an advertisement appeared in 1727 (as &quot;schandelier&quot;) in London. 
The design of the first English true glass chandelier was influenced by Dutch and Flemish brass chandeliers. These English chandeliers were made largely of glass, with the metal parts limited to the central stem and receiver plates and bowls. The metallic part may be silvered or silver-plated, and the silver-plating inside the glass stem can create the illusion that the chandelier is made entirely of glass. A glass bowl at the bottom disguises the metal disc onto which the glass arms are attached. The early glass chandeliers were molded and uncut, often with solid rope-twist arms. Later cuts to the arms were introduced to provide sparkle, and additional ornaments added. Cut glass pendant drops were hung from the frame, initially only a small number, but in increasingly large number by 1770. By the 1800s, the decorative ornaments became so abundant that the underlying structure of the chandelier became obscured. The early chandeliers may follow a rococo style, and later neo-classical style, A notable early producer of glass chandeliers was William Parker; Parker replaced the Dutch-influenced ball stem with a vase-shaped stem, as seen in the chandeliers in Bath Assembly Rooms, which were the first datable neo-Classical style chandeliers as well as the first chandeliers that were signed by the maker. Other designers of neo-Classical chandeliers were Robert and James Adam. Neoclassical motifs in cast metal or carved and gilded wood were common elements in these chandeliers. Chandeliers made in this style also drew heavily on the aesthetic of ancient Greece and Rome, incorporating clean lines, classical proportions and mythological creatures.

Bohemia in present-day Czech Republic has been producing glass for centuries. Bohemian glass contains potash that gives it a clear colorless appearance, which became renown in Europe in the 18th century. Production of crystal chandeliers appeared in Bohemia and Germany in the early 18th century, with designs that followed what were popular in England and France, and many early chandeliers were copies of designs from London. Bohemia soon developed its own styles of chandeliers, the best-known of which is the Maria-Theresa, named after the Empress of Austria. This type of chandeliers do not have a central baluster, and their distinctive feature is the curved flat metal arms placed between sections of molded glass joined together with glass rosettes. Some Bohemian chandeliers used wood instead of metal as the central stem due to the abundance of wood and wood carvers in the area. The Bohemian style was largely successful across Europe and its biggest draw was the chance to obtain spectacular light refraction due to the facets and bevels of crystal prisms. Glass chandeliers became the dominant form of chandelier from about 1750 until at least 1900, and the Czech Republic remains a great producer of glass chandeliers today.

Venice has been a center of glass production, particularly on the island of Murano. The Venetians created a form of soda‚Äìlime glass by adding manganese dioxide that is clear like crystal, which they called cristallo. This glass was typically used to make mirrors, but around 1700, Italian glass factories in Murano started creating new kinds of artistic chandeliers. Since Murano glass is hard and brittle, it is not suitable for cutting/faceting; however, it is lighter, softer and more malleable when heated, and Venetian glassmakers relied upon the properties of their glass to create elaborate forms of chandelier. Typical features of a Murano chandelier are the intricate arabesques of leaves, flowers and fruits that would be enriched by colored glass, made possible by the specific type of glass used in Murano. Great skill and time was required to twist and shape a chandelier precisely.

The ornate type of murano chandelier is called &quot;ciocca&quot; (literally &quot;bouquet of flowers&quot;) for the characteristic decorations of glazed polychrome flowers. The most sumptuous consisted of a metal frame covered with small elements in blown glass, transparent or colored, with decorations of flowers, fruits and leaves, while simpler models had arms made with unique pieces of glass. Their shape was inspired by an original architectural concept: the space on the inside is left almost empty, since decorations are spread all around the central support, distanced from it by the length of the arms. Huge Murano chandeliers were often used for interior lighting in theaters and rooms in important palaces. Despite periods of decline and revival, designs of Murano glass chandeliers have stayed relatively constant through time, and modern productions of these chandelier may still be stylistically nearly identical to those made in the 18th or 19th centuries. Glass arms that were hollow were produced instead of solid glass to accommodate gas lines or electrical wiring were produced by the late 19th century.

Chandeliers were also produced in other countries in the 18th century, including Russia and Sweden. Russian and Scandinavian chandeliers are similar in designs, with a metal frame that is lighter and more decorative, gilded or finished with brass, and hung with small slender glass drops. Russian chandeliers may be accented with coloured glass.

===19th century===

The 19th century was a period of great changes and development; the industrial revolution and the growth of wealth from the industries greatly increased the market for chandeliers, new methods of lighting and better techniques of production emerged. Other countries such as the United States also started producing chandeliers; the first American chandelier is believed to date from 1804. New styles and more complex and elaborate chandeliers also appeared, and production of chandeliers reached a peak in the 19th century. France, which only started producing significant amount of high-quality glass in the late 18th century, became renown as a producer of the finest quality chandeliers. One of the best-known French manufacturers, Baccarat, started making chandeliers in 1824. In England, Perry &amp; Co. produced a large quantity of chandeliers, while F. &amp; C. Osler was known for producing spectacular chandeliers, the great proportion of which went to India, the richest market for chandeliers at that time. In 1843, Osler opened a branch in Calcutta to start production of chandeliers in India.
In England, the imposition of the Glass Excise Act on all glass products in 1811 led to a new style of chandelier being created. Chandelier makers, in order to avoid paying the tax, reused broken glass pieces cut into crystal icicles and strung together, and hung from circular frames in the form of tent or canopy above a hoop, with a bag below and/or tiered sheets that resembled waterfalls. A large number of crystals are used to make such chandeliers, and many may contain over 1,000 pieces of crystal. The central stem is hidden by the crystals. These forms of Regency-era chandeliers were popular all over Europe. In France, chandeliers of similar designs are described as Empire style. After the Glass Excise Act was repealed, chandeliers with glass arms became popular again, but they became larger, bolder and heavily decorated. The largest English-made chandelier in the world (by Hancock Rixon &amp; Dunt and probably F. &amp; C. Osler) is in the Dolmabah√ße Palace in Istanbul, and it has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tons.
In the 19th century, a variety of new methods for producing light that are brighter, cleaner or more convenient than candles began to be used. These included colza oil (Argand lamp), kerosene/paraffin, and gas. Due to its brightness, gas was initially only used for public lighting, later it also appeared in homes. As gas lighting caught on, branched ceiling fixtures called &quot;gasoliers&quot; (a portmanteau of gas and chandelier) were produced. Many candle chandeliers were converted. Gasoliers may have only slight variations in the decorations from chandeliers, but the arms were hollow to carry the gas to the burners. Examples of gasoliers were the extravagant chandeliers in the Royal Pavilion in Brighton first installed in 1821. While popular, gas lighting was considered too bright and harsh on the eyes, and lacking the pleasing quality of candlelight. Shades that surround the gas light were then added to reduce the glare. Gas lighting was eventually replaced by electric light bulbs in the early 20th century.
Electric lighting began to be introduced widely in the late 19th century. For a time, some chandeliers used both gas and electricity, with gas nozzles pointing upward while the light bulbs hung downward. As distribution of electricity widened, and supplies became dependable, electric-only chandeliers became standard. Another portmanteau word, &quot;electrolier&quot;, was coined for these, but nowadays they are most commonly still called chandeliers even though no candles are used. Glass chandeliers requires electrical wiring, large areas of metals and light bulbs, but the results were often not aesthetically pleasing. A large number of light bulbs close together can also produce too much glare. Shades for the bulbs of these electroliers were therefore often added.

===Modern chandeliers===

At the turn of the 20th century, the chandelier still enjoyed the status it had the previous century. Of the many lighting fixtures made that conformed to the popular contemporary styles of Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Modernism, few could be described properly as chandeliers. The popularity of chandeliers declined in the 20th century. A vast array of lighting choices became available, and chandeliers often did not fit the aesthetics of modern architecture and interior design. Light fittings of avant-garde form and material however started to be made 1940. A wide variety of chandeliers of modern design appeared, ranging from the minimalist to the highly extravagant. Towards the end of the 20th century, the popularity of chandeliers revived. A number of glass artists such as Dale Chihuly who produced chandeliers emerged. Chandeliers were often used as decorative focal points for rooms, although some do not necessarily illuminate.

Older styles of chandeliers continued to be produced in the 20th and 21st centuries, and older styles of chandeliers may also be revived, such as the Art Deco-style of chandeliers.

Incandescent light bulbs became the most common source of lighting for modern chandeliers in the 20th century, and a variety of electrical lights such as fluorescent light, halogen. LED lamp are also used. Many antique chandeliers not designed for electrical wiring have also been adapted for electricity. Modern chandeliers produced in older styles and antique chandeliers wired for electricity usually use imitation candles, where incandescent or LED light bulbs are shaped like candle flames. These light bulbs may be dimmable to adjust the brightness. Some may use bulbs containing a shimmering gas discharge that mimics candle flame.

==Chandeliers around the world==
The biggest chandeliers in the world are now found in the Islamic countries. The chandelier in the prayer hall in the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat, Oman was the biggest when it was installed in 2001. It is high, has a diameter of , and weighs over eight tonnes (8,000¬†kg). It is lit by over 1,122 halogen lamps and contains 600,000 pieces of crystal. The biggest chandelier in the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, with a diameter of 10 m, height of 15.5 m, weight of nearly 12 tonnes and lit with 15,500 LED lights, became the world&#x27;s largest chandelier when it was installed in 2007. In 2010, a chandelier of modern design was built in the foyer of an office building in Doha, Qatar. This chandelier has a height of , width of , length of , and weight of 39,683 pounds (18 tonnes). It has 165,000 LED lights and 2,300 optical crystals and it is considered the biggest interactive LED chandelier in the world. In 2022, a chandelier in height, in length and in width and weighing 16 tonnes was unveiled at the Assima Mall in Kuwait. In Egypt, the largest and heaviest chandelier in the world, weighing 24,300¬†kg (53,572¬†lb) with a diameter of 22¬†m (72.2¬†ft) in four levels made by Asfour Crystal, was installed in the Grand Mosque of the Islamic Cultural Center in Cairo.

<text>The Convention Army (1777‚Äì1783) was an army of British and allied troops captured after the Battles of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War.

==Convention of Saratoga==
On 17 October 1777, British General John Burgoyne surrendered his army according to terms negotiated with American general Horatio Gates following the 7 October Battle of Bemis Heights. The terms were titled the &quot;Convention of Saratoga&quot;, and specified that the troops would be sent back to Europe after giving a parole that they would not fight again in the conflict. The British army was accorded the honours of war, and Burgoyne had his sword returned to him by Gates.

Baroness Frederika Riedesel, wife of General Riedesel, just emerged from her shelter in the cellar of the Marshall House, attended the surrender ceremony which she vividly describes in her &quot;Journal&quot;: &quot;On the 17th of October the capitulation was consummated. The generals waited upon the American general-in-chief, Gates, and the troops laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war&quot;.

==Cambridge==
A total of about 5,900 British, German, and Canadian troops surrendered at Saratoga. Under guard by John Glover&#x27;s troops, they were marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they arrived on 8 November. The rank and file were quartered in crude barracks that had been constructed during the 1775 siege of Boston, while most of the officers were billeted in houses. The army ended up spending about one year in Cambridge, while negotiations concerning its status took place in military and diplomatic channels. During this year, about 1,300 prisoners escaped, often because they became involved with local women while working on farms in the area.

The Continental Congress ordered Burgoyne to provide a list and description of all officers to ensure that they would not return. When he refused, Congress revoked the terms of the convention, resolving in January 1778 to hold the army until King George III ratified the convention, an act they believed unlikely to happen, as it represented an acknowledgment of American independence.

==Virginia==
In November 1778, the Convention Army began marching south 700 miles (1,100 km) to Charlottesville, Virginia, arriving in uncharacteristically snowy weather in January 1779. Approximately 600 men escaped during the march. They were held at the hastily and poorly constructed Albemarle Barracks until late 1780, under the guard of Lt. Col Joseph Crockett&#x27;s Western Battalion.

During the army&#x27;s years in Virginia it had an important economic impact on the Blue Ridge area of Virginia. The Virginia troops assigned to guard duty were generally better fed and equipped than any other forces, so that prisoner letters would reflect a strong Continental Army. Money sent by the prisoner&#x27;s families in Britain and Germany provided a lot of hard currency and coin for the back-country area. The presence of the POWs created new demands for food and other goods ‚Äì items for which they had to pay steep prices. Thomas Jefferson estimated that the presence of the prisoners increased the area&#x27;s circulating currency by at least $30,000 a week. 

High-ranking officers, and sometimes their wives, such as the Major General Riedesel and his wife and Major General William Phillips were sought as guests on the social scene. The rank-and-file, however, dealt with miserable living conditions as the small amount of money appropriated to build the barracks proved inadequate. &quot;Each barrack,&quot; observed Lieutenant August Wilhelm Du Roi, &quot;is 24 feet long, and 14 feet wide, big enough to shelter 18 men. The construction is so miserable that it surpasses all that you can imagine in Germany of a very poorly built log house. It is something like the following: Each side is put up of 8 to 9 round fir trees, which are laid one on top the other, but so far apart that it is almost possible for a man to crawl through ... The roof is made of round trees covered with split fir trees...&quot; And then, &quot;a great number of our men preferred to camp out in the woods, where they could protect themselves better against the cold than in the barracks.&quot; For some officers, their time in Virginia, however, was not entirely uneventful. An excerpt from the Orderly Book of Crockett&#x27;s Western Battalion elaborates: &quot;The commanding officer has been informed that an officer of the Convention Army who is residing in a different part of the county makes a practice of going to Negrew quarters in the night and associating with slaves, to the disatisfaction of the inhabitants. This practice is positively forbid in future...&quot;

In late 1780, when British forces became active in Virginia, the army was again moved, this time being marched north by the Western Battalion to Frederick, Maryland. Except for specific officer exchanges, they were held there until 1783. When the war formally ended, those who survived the forced marches and camp fevers were sent home.

<text>The Vancouver Millionaires (later known as the Vancouver Maroons) were a professional ice hockey team that competed in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and the Western Canada Hockey League between 1911 and 1926. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, they played in Denman Arena, the first artificial ice surface in Canada and the largest indoor ice rink in the world at the time it opened.

The Millionaires/Maroons succeeded as PCHA champions six times (1915, 1918, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924) and won the Stanley Cup once, in 1915, against the Ottawa Senators of the NHA.

Their jerseys were maroon, featuring a white V with &quot;Vancouver&quot; spelled down one side of the V and up the other. Hall of Famers Fred &quot;Cyclone&quot; Taylor, Mickey MacKay and Didier Pitre were among the most significant players to don the Millionaires/Maroons uniform in the team&#x27;s history.

On October 1, 2010, the Vancouver Canucks purchased the rights to logos, jerseys and trademarks of the Vancouver Millionaires. Since that time, the Canucks have worn Millionaires throwback uniforms on a few occasions, most notably on March 2, 2014, in the 2014 Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators.

==Team history==
In 1911, the Patrick brothers, Frank and Lester, inaugurated their own professional ice hockey league on the west coast, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, giving birth to three teams, one of which was the Vancouver Millionaires. Frank aligned himself with Vancouver, playing for, coaching and managing the team. In order to earn credibility as a league, the PCHA lured players from the NHA, and in 1912, the Millionaires acquired the highly touted Cyclone Taylor, who would play for and star in Vancouver for the following ten seasons ‚Äî the remainder of his career. During his tenure in Vancouver, Taylor tallied 263 points in 131 games.
Upon the 1914‚Äì1915 season, the NHA and PCHA came to an agreement that each league&#x27;s respective champion would play for the Stanley Cup; in the first year of this agreement, the Millionaires ‚Äî led by Patrick and Taylor ‚Äî emerged as league champion and defeated the Ottawa Senators to earn their first and only Stanley Cup championship. In a best-of-five series played at Denman Arena, the Millionaires swept Ottawa by scores of 6‚Äì2, 8‚Äì3, and 12‚Äì3; Taylor led the team with 6 goals. At the time, it was the furthest west the Cup had been awarded and is Vancouver&#x27;s only Stanley Cup champion.

In 1918, Vancouver would once again compete for the Stanley Cup, defeating the Seattle Metropolitans in a two-game final for the PCHA title, but would be defeated by the Toronto Arenas of the NHL (evolved from the NHA) three games to two. Between 1918 and 1924, Vancouver would win the PCHA title in five of seven seasons. In 1921 and 1922, they were defeated by the Ottawa Senators and Toronto St. Pats in back-to-back Cup Finals, respectively. In 1922, the team changed its name to the Vancouver Maroons and, although league champion in the PCHA&#x27;s final two seasons, Vancouver would not compete for the Stanley Cup. As a result of the newly founded Western Canada Hockey League, the PCHA champion would have to defeat the WCHL champion en route to a Cup series against the NHL champion; the Maroons would fall to the Edmonton Eskimos in 1923 and the Calgary Tigers in 1924.

Following the 1923‚Äì1924 season, the Maroons were absorbed by the WCHL upon the PCHA&#x27;s demise, but would not achieve the same success of the previous years. In 1926, the WCHL suffered the same fate of the PCHA, and after 15 years, the team subsequently folded, as well.

==Tributes==
In 1999, musician and bodybuilder Jon Mikl Thor started VM Sports, a company to market a line of Millionaires apparel. Since there were no genuine Millionaires sweaters in existence since a fire destroyed Denman Arena in 1936, Thor trademarked the Vancouver Millionaires name and the &quot;Victory V&quot; logo. On May 1, 2008, the BC Sports Hall Of Fame was donated one such Millionaires sweater from VM Sports, which is now featured in the Hall&#x27;s Cyclone Taylor display. On October 1, 2010 the Vancouver Canucks parent company, Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment, acquired the Vancouver Millionaires trademark from Thor.

In honour of the Millionaires as the city&#x27;s only Stanley Cup-winning team, the Vancouver Giants, a major junior Western Hockey League (WHL) team, wore Millionaires jerseys during their November 21, 2008 game against the Kamloops Blazers on the team&#x27;s &quot;Stanley Cup Legends Night&quot;. That same month, the Canucks unveiled their new third jerseys, including a new shoulder logo that pays tribute to the Millionaires by including a &quot;V&quot;.

In the 2012‚Äì13 season the Vancouver Canucks added the Millionaires&#x27; &quot;V&quot; to their jersey. They wore a modified version of the Millionaires jersey on March 16, 2013 against the Detroit Red Wings. They again wore the Millionaires jersey for the 2014 Heritage Classic on March 2, 2014, against the Ottawa Senators, who wore a version of the original Senators jersey. The Millionaires jersey was worn a third time on March 26, 2015, against the Colorado Avalanche.

<doc id="614716" wikidata="Q1666745" url="?curid=614716" title="International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center">
<text>The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (known ‚Äì even in English ‚Äì by its Spanish acronym CIMMYT for Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Ma√≠z y Trigo) is a non-profit research-for-development organization that develops improved varieties of wheat and maize with the aim of contributing to food security, and innovates agricultural practices to help boost production, prevent crop disease and improve smallholder farmers&#x27; livelihoods. CIMMYT is one of the 15 CGIAR centers. CIMMYT is known for hosting the world&#x27;s largest maize and wheat genebank at its headquarters in Mexico.

CIMMYT&#x27;s ninth director general, Bram Govaerts, replaced Martin Kropff in 2021. Other notable scientists like Thomas Lumpkin have served as director general of CIMMYT.

== Origins ==

CIMMYT emerged from cooperative efforts of the Mexican government and the Rockefeller Foundation that led in 1943 to the founding of the Office of Special Studies, an organization within the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture. The goal of the office was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement.

The project developed into a collaboration between Mexican and international researchers. It established global networks to test experimental crop varieties. One of its researchers, wheat breeder Norman Borlaug, developed dwarf wheat varieties that put more energy into grain production and responded better to fertilizer than older varieties. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply. The program was renamed and morphed into CIMMYT in 1963, though it was still under the Secretariat of Agriculture&#x27;s jurisdiction. As international demand grew and it became apparent CIMMYT required internal organization and increased funding, the center was reorganized and established as a non-profit scientific and educational institution in its own right in 1966.

In the early 1970s, a small cadre of development organizations, national sponsors, and private foundations organized CGIAR to further spread the impact of agricultural research to more nations. CIMMYT became one of the first international research centers to be supported through CGIAR. Today, CGIAR comprises 15 such centers, all dedicated to sustainable food security through scientific research.

== Activities ==

CIMMYT scientists support national research systems and work through small- to medium-scale seed enterprises to offer affordable, improved seed and sustainable farming methods to smallholder farmers. Though its headquarters are in Mexico, the center operates through 12 regional offices (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Turkey, and Zimbabwe), as well as number of experimental stations.

CIMMYT&#x27;s researchers promote the sustainable intensification of farming systems, for example, through the use of machinery that allows for resource-poor female farmers in Africa and South Asia to reduce labor costs and conservation agriculture practices such as no-till farming, which allows direct planting without plowing or preparing the soil.

CIMMYT hosts the largest collection of maize and wheat in the world: 28,000 unique kinds of maize and 140,000 types of wheat. Materials are made available under the terms and conditions of the multilateral system of access and benefit sharing, using the Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA). A duplicate of these wheat varieties is stored at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway. Through CIMMYT&#x27;s global breeding system and partner network, this genetic diversity is used to develop maize and wheat varieties that have higher yields, and can survive climate stress and diseases.

Last year, CIMMYT scientists have developed 70% of wheat varieties presently planted globally and about half of the world&#x27;s corn, or maize, varieties. By CIMMYT&#x27;s own accounts, the pedigrees of about half of the maize and wheat varieties sown in low- and middle-income countries carry contributions from its breeding research.

== Criticisms ==

Despite its noble goals of sustainability and self-sufficiency, one of the organization&#x27;s founders and researchers, Norman Borlaug, has faced criticism. Borlaug&#x27;s obituarist, Christopher Reed argued in an interview with The Guardian from 2014 that although his Green Revolution and high-yielding agricultural techniques averted poverty in the short term, in the long time they might have added to it. Critics of CIMMYT argue that it is important to consider the social and ecological changes that the Green Revolution, and subsequently CIMMYT, create for local farmers. According to critics, dependency on expensive &#x27;high-yielding&#x27; seeds that demand expensive fertilizers has pushed local farmers who cannot afford them out of the market, causing further social inequalities and, in some cases, cropping intensification has degraded soils and depleted aquifers. At the time Norman Borlaug began the Green Revolution, the US agricultural science establishment and agribusiness industries supported him because it allowed their industries to grow around the world as dependency on their patented seeds and herbicides increased. Nonetheless, in contrast to the preceding observations, which are sourced from the popular press, a widely-cited 2003 article in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Science&quot; notes that &quot;...it is unclear what alternative scenario would have allowed developing countries to meet, with lower environmental impact, the human needs posed by the massive population expansion of the 20th century.&quot; Today, CIMMYT still works closely with both public and private partners, including seed companies, to foster farmers&#x27; access to seed of improved varieties and agro-chemicals of their choice. One example is &quot;StrigAway,&quot; a herbicide-coated maize seed variety that combats Striga, a parasitic weed that infests up to 50 million hectares of Sub-Saharan African land. Much of the wheat seed in the South is produced by the public sector; in the case of maize, seed companies play a key role in seed production and marketing. CIMMYT maize and wheat breeding are available free of charge to public and private partners, as international public goods.

== Partners and funders ==
Main funders include Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, CGIAR, Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR), OCP Group and the national governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Norway and the United States.

Historically, CIMMYT received funding from the European Commission and the Rockefeller Foundation.

<text>Mungo Jerry (formerly known as Mungo Jerry Blues Band) are a British rock band formed by Ray Dorset in Ashford, Middlesex, in 1970. Experiencing their greatest success in the early 1970s, with a changing line-up always fronted by Dorset, the group&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;In the Summertime&quot;, which sold 30 million copies worldwide and is the biggest-selling single of all-time by a British band. They had nine charting singles in the UK, including two number ones, five top-20 hits in South Africa, and four in the Top 100 in Canada.

==History==
===Formation and original band: 1970‚Äì1971===

Mungo Jerry came to prominence in 1970 after their performances at the Hollywood Music Festival at Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, on 23‚Äì24 May, which was their first gig under this name, inspired by the poem &quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer&quot; from T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;. They performed alongside Black Sabbath, Traffic, Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, the Grateful Dead (their first performance in the UK) and Jos√© Feliciano. Their 23 May show was well received and the organisers asked them to perform again on the following day. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;In the Summertime&quot;, the first maxi single in the world, released on 22 May, entered the UK charts at No. 13 and the following week went straight to No. 1. Ray Dorset had to ask his boss for time off to do the BBC Show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Ray Dorset and Colin Earl had previously been members of The Good Earth. Bassist Dave Hutchins left to join Bobby Parker&#x27;s band, and the drummer was dismissed, so Dorset and Earl decided to fulfil the one remaining gig, an Oxford University Christmas Ball in December 1968, as a three-piece with Joe Rush, one of Dorset&#x27;s colleagues, on double bass. Also on the bill was Miller Anderson, making his debut as a singer and guitarist, and Mick Farren and the Social Deviants. Though booked for only one set, Good Earth were asked to perform another after the bands had finished, playing a selection of American folk/blues/skiffle/jug band music from Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie and others, and some of Dorset&#x27;s songs.

The trio played more gigs and landed a regular slot at the Master Robert Motel in Osterley, Middlesex, where they soon built up a following, including banjo, guitar and blues harp player Paul King who eventually joined the band, making it a four-piece.

After Rush left, Mike Cole was recruited on double bass, and this line-up recorded the first seventeen Mungo Jerry tracks which made up the first album and maxi-single including &quot;In the Summertime&quot;. When they made their national debut at the Hollywood Festival, Rush joined them on stage for some numbers to play washboard. The record topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks.

According to Joseph Murrell&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot; (1978), &quot;Mungomania&quot; was possibly the most startling and unpredictable pop phenomenon to hit Britain since The Beatles.

Mungo Jerry made their first trip to the United States in September 1970. On their return Mike Cole was fired and replaced by John Godfrey, who played bass on their second UK maxi-single, &quot;Baby Jump&quot;, which also topped the UK chart in March 1971. The third UK single, another maxi, &quot;Lady Rose&quot;, also released in 1971, was set to become another No. 1 hit, but it was temporarily withdrawn from sale on the order of the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. This was due to complaints about the inclusion of the traditional song &quot;Have a Whiff on Me&quot; (to which Dorset had added some of his own lyrics) on the grounds that it advocated the use of cocaine. The maxi single was then reissued with &quot;She Rowed&quot; in place of the offending song.

===Line-up changes and side-projects: 1972‚Äì1980s===

Eventually, Dorset found the group&#x27;s good-time blues and jug band repertoire restricting, and in 1972 he released a solo album, &quot;Cold Blue Excursion&quot;, with his songs backed by strings and brass and, in one instance, a jazz band. His intention to broaden the group&#x27;s appeal by recruiting a drummer led to King and Earl trying to sack him, but the management, regarding Dorset as inseparable in the public eye from Mungo Jerry, fired them both instead. Dorset and Godfrey, the bassist, recruited new members and presented a new sound, heard on the fourth album &quot;Boot Power&quot;. Colin Earl and Paul King went on to form The King Earl Boogie Band and recorded an album at Richard Branson&#x27;s Manor Studio called &quot;Trouble at Mill&quot;, produced by Dave Cousins of Strawbs. Their June 1972 single &quot;Plastic Jesus&quot; was banned by the BBC. They played together on and off in the years following and ended up with a band called Skeleton Crew.

Mungo Jerry&#x27;s hits continued through to 1976 with &quot;Open Up&quot; (Top Twenty in Europe); &quot;Alright, Alright, Alright&quot; (a rewrite of an old French hit for Jacques Dutronc, and again a major hit worldwide reaching the Top 3 in the UK); &quot;Wild Love&quot;; &quot;Long-Legged Woman Dressed in Black&quot;, &quot;Hello Nadine&quot; (European hit and Top Five in Canada), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Secret&quot; (European hit). &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be in the Army to Fight in the War&quot; gave Mungo Jerry another hit.

In 1975, Earl returned to play keyboards, drummer Peter Sullivan joined and percussion player Joe Rush, part-time member of the band in earlier days, also came back for a while. The group&#x27;s line-up continued to change. Among those who have played with them are bassist Bob Daisley, drummers Dave Bidwell, Paul Hancox and Boris Williams, guitarist Dick Middleton, keyboard player Sev Lewkowicz, and keyboard/accordion player Steve Jones. They have remained popular throughout Europe. Mungo Jerry were the first western band to have live television gigs in all countries behind the Iron Curtain.

In 1980, another Dorset song, &quot;Feels Like I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, originally written for Elvis Presley, and recorded by the band as a B side of a single, became a British number one hit for Kelly Marie. They remained successful with overseas hits like &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; (a reggae version of the Bob Dylan song) and &quot;Sunshine Reggae&quot; (British version by Mungo Jerry &amp; Horizon).

In 1983, Dorset was part of the blues super-group Katmandu, which recorded &quot;A Case for the Blues&quot;, with guitarist Peter Green, formerly of Fleetwood Mac, and keyboard player Vincent Crane, formerly of Atomic Rooster and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.

<text>Moorea ( or ; , ), also spelled Moorea, is a volcanic island in French Polynesia. It is one of the Windward Islands, a group that is part of the Society Islands, northwest of Tahiti. The name comes from the Tahitian word , meaning &quot;yellow lizard&quot;: = lizard; ( ) = yellow. An older name for the island is &quot;&quot;, sometimes spelled or (among other spellings that were used by early visitors before Tahitian spelling was standardized). Early Western colonists and voyagers also referred to Moorea as &quot;York Island&quot; or &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;.

The island is smaller and west of Tahiti, the largest in the Society Islands, but is close enough it can be seen from towns on the west side of that island such as Faa&#x27;a.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
According to recent archaeological evidence, the Society Islands were probably settled from Samoa and Tonga around 200 CE.

Nine tribal principalities emerged in the enclosed valleys, which in turn were subdivided into individual clans. The stratified society was characterized by a hierarchical leadership whose elite combined both political and religious power. The leading families of Moorea remained linked by marriage and kinship for centuries with those of the neighboring island of Tahiti. These connections led to important alliances, but at other times were also the source of bloody conflicts.

Intensive research on the Opunohu Valley, which continues to this day, initiated by Kenneth P. Emory in the 1920s and continued in the 1960s by archaeologist Roger C. Green of the University of Auckland, provides an exemplary picture of the evolution of Moorean society. The interaction between increasing population density and human modification of the environment resulted in major changes in the form of society.

The so-called Pre-Atiroo phase, prior to 1000 CE, is characterized by extensive clearing and cultivation of the valley slopes, which by the end of the period had led to erosion and the formation of alluvial soils. Society was not yet stratified, but was relatively homogeneous.

In the Atiroo period (1000‚Äì1650 CE), artificial cultivation terraces were built on the slopes and simple stone buildings, such as the Marae Tapauruuru. The remains of rectangular houses (&quot;fare haupape&quot;) and those with elongated oval floor plans (&quot;fare potee&quot;), reserved for the power elite, indicate a strictly stratified and hierarchical form of society.

The later Marama period (1650‚Äì1788 CE) is marked by the conquest of the Opunohu Valley by the chiefs (&quot;ariki&quot;) of the Marama tribe, originally settled on the coast, who succeeded in uniting all the other clans in the valley under their rule. In addition to a further increase in population, this phase also saw a lively construction activity of representative religious structures - large marae in the style of a step pyramid. Towards the end of this period, the Opunohu valley became a refuge for the Ariki who resisted European influence.

The first European to sight the island was Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s, in 1606. The first European settlers arrived during the 18th century. The first Europeans to arrive on the island were the Englishmen Samuel Wallis and James Cook. Captain James Cook first landed on Tahiti, where he planned the 1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti and Moorea. At Moorea, where Taaroa was chief, Cook first landed in ≈åp≈´nohu Bay, Cook&#x27;s Bay was later named in his honor. Spanish sailor Domingo de Bonechea visited it in 1774 and named it &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;.

It is likely that Teraura, a Polynesian woman who accompanied the Bounty mutineers to Pitcairn Island, was from Moorea.

The island was among those visited by the United States Exploring Expedition on its tour of the South Pacific in 1839.

Charles Darwin found inspiration for his theory regarding the formation of coral atolls when looking down upon Moorea while standing on a peak on Tahiti. He described it as a &quot;picture in a frame&quot;, referring to the barrier reef encircling the island.

Don the Beachcomber lived here briefly in the late 1920s. His houseboat was destroyed by tropical cyclones after he moved it from Waikiki after 1947.

On October 7, 1967, construction was completed on the Moorea Airport, which opened the following month.

== Geography ==

The island was formed as a volcano 1.5 to 2.5 million years ago, the result of the Society hotspot in the mantle under the oceanic plate that formed the whole of the Society Archipelago. It is theorized that the current bays were formerly river basins that filled during the Holocene searise.

Moorea is about 16¬†km (10 miles) across. There are two small, nearly symmetrical bays on the north shore. The one to the west is called ≈åp≈´nohu Bay. The main surrounding communes of the bay are Pihaena in the east and Papet≈çai to the west. The one to the east is Cook&#x27;s Bay, also called Pao Pao Bay since the largest commune of Moorea is at the bottom of the bay. The other communes are Pihaena to the west and busy Maharepa to the east. The highest point is Mount Tohivea, near the center of Moorea. It dominates the vista from the two bays and can be seen from Tahiti. There are also hiking trails in the mountains. Vaiare Bay is another small inlet, smaller than the two main bays, on the east shore. The main village is located just south of the bay.

=== Geology ===
Moorea is an atoll whose main island consists mainly of igneous rocks. The island, like neighboring Tahiti, formed as part of the &quot;Society Chain&quot; from a hot spot on the Pacific Plate and is between 1.5 and 2 million years old. The enclosed reef surrounds the entire island, but has several navigable passages. The reef is relatively close to the island, so Moorea has formed only a narrow lagoon.

=== Climate ===
Moorea is located in the Earth&#x27;s tropical belt. The climate is tropical-warm and very humid, which favors the lush vegetation of the island. The average temperature ranges between 28 and 30¬†¬∞C, with little difference between months. The rainiest months are from December to February, the (winter) months from July to September are drier. There is a constant wind that moderates temperatures. However, an occasional cyclone cannot be ruled out. In the 1982‚Äì83 season, a series of cyclones in the Society Islands also caused considerable property damage in Moorea.

=== Demographics ===
The island had a population of 14,226 inhabitants in the 2002 census which increased to 17,718 in 2017, distributed in the associated communes of Afareaitu, Haapiti, Paopao, Papet≈çai, and Teavaro. Together with Maiao it forms the commune of Moorea-Maiao, which had 14,550 inhabitants by 2002.

The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through population censuses conducted in the municipality since 1977. Since 2006, the INSEE publishes annually the legal populations of the municipalities, but the law on local democracy of February 27, 2002, in its articles dedicated to the population census, introduced population censuses every five years in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Mayotte and the Wallis and Futuna islands, which was not the case before. For the municipality, the first comprehensive census under the new system was conducted in 2002; previous censuses took place in 1996, 1988, 1983, 1977 and 1971.

=== Bays ===
The most famous sight of Moorea is Cook&#x27;s Bay, where cruise ships regularly anchor. It is a deep blue bay that often has white sailing yachts and in the background the 830 m high Mount Mouaputa, this being probably the most photographed South Seas image. Next door is Opunohu Bay, where many exterior shots of the 1984 movie The Bounty were filmed.

The two bays are connected by a steep, winding scenic road. In the once densely populated Opunohu Valley, the indigenous Polynesians built numerous worship platforms (marae). The remains of these religious sites can be found everywhere off the road, some of them are signposted. Marae Titiroa is surrounded by banyan trees and was reconstructed in the late 1960s. A few hundred meters away is the multi-level Marae Ahu-o-Mahine, also well preserved. The trail continues to the Belv√©d√®re lookout overlooking Mount Rotui, Cook Bay and Opunohu Bay.

===Flora and fauna===
Due to the short distance to Tahiti and similarities in climate and soil structure, the flora of Moorea is comparable to that of Tahiti. The narrow coastal strip is dominated by anthropic plants, due to dense settlement and centuries of human use. However, significant remnants of the original plant communities have survived in the uninhabited and partially inaccessible interior of the island. The University of California at Berkeley maintains a permanent research institute on Moorea, Gump Station, to study tropical biodiversity and interactions between cultural processes and the ecosystem. From 2008 to 2010, Moorea was the site of the Moorea Biocode project, the first comprehensive inventory of all macroscopic (&gt;2mm) life in an ecosystem. They collected specimens, photographs, and genetic barcodes for over 5,700 species of plants, animals, and fungi.

Terrestrial mammals did not originally exist on the Society Islands; they were introduced exclusively by humans. Early Polynesian settlers brought dogs, pigs, chickens and the Polynesian rat as food animals, while Europeans introduced goats, cows, sheep and horses. The indigenous land animals are only insects, land crabs, snails and lizards.

Many Moorean endemic species that have gone extinct or been extirpated. The Polynesian tree snails of the genus &quot;Partula&quot; were largely wiped out after the rosy wolf snail was introduced in 1977, although captive and small refuge populations on Tahiti still exist. In 2019 both &quot;Partula rosea&quot; and &quot;Partula varia&quot; were reintroduced to the island. Until the 1980s, the Moorea reed warbler, an endemic species, was recorded on the island. This songbird was closely related to the Tahiti reed warbler and may have been displaced by the common myna. Another bird species extinct on Moorea is the Moorea sandpiper, of which only two specimens are known from 1777. The tree &quot;Glochidion nadeaudii&quot; is endemic to the island, growing in montane rain forests above 400 meters elevation.

There are no animals on Moorea that are dangerous to humans. Sand fleas on the beach and mosquitoes, which are everywhere in the interior of the island, can be unpleasant. The marine fauna of the lagoon and coral reef is very rich in species. In addition to more than 500 species of coral fish, divers and snorkelers can observe numerous molluscs, echinoderms, and crustaceans of the tropical sea. Behind the fringing reef are sharks, rays, swordfish, and sea turtles. From July to October, humpback whales pass by the island. Whale and dolphin watching is offered to tourists.

==Politics==
The island is administratively part of the commune (municipality) of Moorea-Maiao, itself in the administrative subdivision of the Windward Islands. The main village is ƒÄfareaitu. The largest village is Pao Pao at the bottom of Cook&#x27;s Bay. The second largest is Maharepa.

== Economy ==

This island is one of the main tourist destinations in French Polynesia, where there are several luxury resorts.

Transportation to this island is usually done from Tahiti by air transport in flights of about 5 minutes or through numerous ferries that move from the port of Papeete to Moorea. It is also possible to hire a private boat transport.

===Tourism===
Moorea is visited by many western tourists who travel to French Polynesia. Especially popular as a honeymoon destination, Moorea can often be seen in advertisements in American wedding magazines.
Arthur Frommer declared in Frommer&#x27;s travel guide that he considered it &quot;the most beautiful island in the world&quot;.

The main source of income is the tourism from the decade of 1960. An American company constructed in 1961 the Bali Shark Hotel, the first hotel of luxury of Moorea, in the north coast, near the town of Maharepa. Since then, the tourism has continuously increased, so that at the present time - according to affirm some guides of trips - Moorea has even more tourist hotels than Tahiti. The hotel complex are located mainly on the north and northwest coast. Most of the beaches on the northwest coast belong to hotels and are not open to the public. On the northeast coast, in Temae, near the airfield, there is a public beach.
Moorea is sometimes visited by cruise ships.

On the west coast, a traditional Polynesian village, the Tiki Village, has been rebuilt for tourists. There are dance performances, demonstrations of Polynesian handicrafts, and souvenir stores.

The race called the Moorea Marathon, held annually in February, is promoted by the tourism industry as the most beautiful in the world. Another international sporting event is the Aitoman Triathlon, held in October each year.
=== Agriculture ===
Until the end of the 20th century, coffee was still grown on Moorea. Due to falling coffee prices, this is no longer profitable and the cultivation of agricultural export crops has shifted to pineapple and Tahitian vanilla. Some small family farms continue to produce copra in the traditional way. Breadfruit, yams, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, coconuts, and other tropical and subtropical fruits are grown for home consumption and hotel kitchens. Fishing continues to play an important, though declining, role in the island&#x27;s economy.

==Research facilities==
The University of California, Berkeley maintains the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station on the west coast of Cook&#x27;s Bay. The Gump station is also home to the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research Site (MCR LTER), part of a network established by the National Science Foundation in 1980 to support research on long-term ecological phenomena. The Moorea Coral Reef LTER became the 26th site in the network in September 2004.

Since 1981, the French √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (EPHE) and the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (National Centre for Scientific Research; CNRS) have been maintaining a research station at the end of ≈åp≈´nohu Bay. This &quot;Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l&#x27;Environnement&quot; (CRIOBE, Centre for island research and environment observatory) is a research site for several international projects, including the monitoring of coral reefs throughout French Polynesia as well as the monitoring of the fish population on the Tƒ´ahurƒÅ transect of Moorea&#x27;s reef.

== Religion ==

The majority of the local population are Christians, a consequence of European colonization and the activity of missionary groups from both the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant groups. The Catholic Church controls four church buildings and a religious center on the island, all under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Papeete with headquarters on the island of Tahiti:

St. Joseph Church in Paopao (√âglise Saint Joseph), Holy Family Church in Haapiti (√âglise de la Sainte-Famille), St. Michael Church in Papet≈çai (√âglise de Saint-Michel) St. Patrick Church in Afareaitu (√âglise de Saint-Patrice) and St. Francis Xavier Religious Center in Varari (&quot;Centre religieux Saint-Fran√ßois-Xavier&quot;).

Near Afareaitu is Moorea&#x27;s oldest worship platform, the Marae Umarea, built around 900 CE, with its enclosure of large coral slabs directly over the lagoon.

==Transportation==

Several ferries go to the Vaiare wharf in Moorea daily from Papeete, the Tahitian capital. Moorea&#x27;s Temae Airport has connections to the international airport in Papeete and onward to other Society Islands such as Tahiti. There is one road that goes around the island.

<doc id="614735" wikidata="Q172984" url="?curid=614735" title="Gelatin silver print">
<text>The gelatin silver print is the most commonly used chemical process in black-and-white photography, and is the fundamental chemical process for modern analog color photography. As such, films and printing papers available for analog photography rarely rely on any other chemical process to record an image. A suspension of silver salts in gelatin is coated onto a support such as glass, flexible plastic or film, baryta paper, or resin-coated paper. These light-sensitive materials are stable under normal keeping conditions and are able to be exposed and processed even many years after their manufacture. The &quot;dry plate&quot; gelatin process was an improvement on the collodion wet-plate process dominant from the 1850s‚Äì1880s, which had to be exposed and developed immediately after coating.

== History ==
Gelatine was used to copy the images of Daguerreotypes by 1845 and Alphonse Louis Poitevin wrote about positive proofs of negatives on dry gelatine plates in 1850. 

In the 1860s, the dry plate collodion process (with gelatin or albumen) was described as advantageous for outdoor photography, especially when a large amount of shots in different places were required, or when there was little time. Negatives taken during summer outings could wait until the long winter evenings to be developed, fixed and printed. Exposure times were long compared to the wet process, but that required much more time to prepare a plate before exposure, to develop, fix and wash the negative soon after, with chemicals and a portable dark room that had to be dragged around and installed. 

The introduction of the gelatin silver process is commonly attributed to Richard Leach Maddox, author of the 1871 article &quot;An Experiment with Gelatino-Bromide&quot;.

In 1873, Charles Harper Bennett discovered a method of hardening the emulsion, making it more resistant to friction. In 1878, Bennett discovered that by prolonged heating, the sensitivity of the emulsion could be greatly increased. While dry plate processes could previous only be used with long exposures, Bennett&#x27;s plates contributed much to instantaneous photography turning into a very common practice.

George Eastman developed a machine to coat glass plates in 1879 and founded the Eastman Film and Dry Plate Company in 1881.

William de Wiveleslie Abney and Josef Maria Eder improved the formula with silver chloride.

Gelatin silver print paper was made as early as 1874 on a commercial basis, but it was poor quality because the dry-plate emulsion was coated onto the paper only as an afterthought. Coating machines for the production of continuous rolls of sensitized paper were in use by the mid-1880s, though widespread adoption of gelatin silver print materials did not occur until the 1890s. The earliest papers had no baryta layer, and it was not until the 1890s that baryta coating became a commercial operation, first in Germany, in 1894, and then taken up by Kodak by 1900.

Although the baryta layer plays an important part in the manufacture of smooth and glossy prints, the baryta paper of the 1890s did not produce the lustrous or glossy print surface that became the standard for fine art photography in the twentieth century. Matting agents, textured papers, and thin baryta layers that were not heavily calendering produced a low-gloss and textured appearance. The higher gloss papers first became popular in the 1920s and 30s as photography transitioned from pictorialism into modernism, photojournalism, and &quot;straight&quot; photography.

Research over the last 125 years has led to current materials that exhibit low grain and high sensitivity to light.

== Technology ==

=== Overview ===
The gelatin silver print or gelatin developing out paper (DOP) is a monochrome imaging process based on the light sensitivity of silver halides. They have been made for both contact printing and enlarging purposes by modifying the paper&#x27;s light sensitivity. A brief exposure to a negative produces a latent image, which is then made visible by a developing agent. The image is then made permanent by treatment in a photographic fixer, which removes the remaining light sensitive silver halides. And finally, a water bath clears the fixer from the print. The final image consists of small particles of silver bound in a layer of gelatin. This gelatin image layer is only one of the four layers found in a typical gelatin silver print, which typically include the overcoat, image layer, baryta, and paper support.

=== Layer structure ===

A gelatin silver print is composed of four layers: paper base, baryta, gelatin binder, and a protective gelatin layer or overcoat. The multi-layer structure of the gelatin silver print and the sensitivity of the silver imaging salts require specialized coating equipment and fastidious manufacturing technique to produce a consistent product that is free of impurities harmful to the image.

The paper base or support serves as the substrate onto which the subsequent layers are attached. Paper is in many ways an ideal support: it is lightweight, flexible, and strong enough to withstand both wet processing and regular handling. The photographic paper base must be free of photoactive impurities such as iron and lignins. In order to obtain this purity, the paper was originally made from cotton rags, though after World War I there was a transition to purified wood pulp, which has been used ever since.

The second layer is the baryta, a white opaque coating made primarily from gelatin and barium sulfate. Its purpose is to cover the paper fibers and form a smooth surface upon which to coat the gelatin. Surface textures are created by a variety of textured felts used in the drying of the paper, calendaring, and embossing before or after application of the baryta layer depending on the desired effect.

The third layer is the gelatin binder that holds the silver grains of the photographic image. Gelatin has many qualities that make it an ideal photographic binder. Among these are toughness and abrasion resistance when dry and its ability to swell and allow the penetration of processing solutions. The fourth layer, called the overcoat, supercoat, or topcoat, is a very thin layer of hardened gelatin that is applied on top of the gelatin binder. It acts as a protective layer, providing superior abrasion resistance to the print surface.

=== Image and processing ===
Before a paper is exposed, the image layer is a clear gelatin matrix holding the light-sensitive silver halides. For gelatin silver prints, these silver halides are typically combinations of silver bromide and silver chloride. Exposure to a negative is typically done with an enlarger, although contact printing was also popular, particularly among amateurs in the early twentieth century and among users of large format cameras. Wherever the light strikes the paper the silver halides form small specks of silver metal on their surface by the chemical process of reduction. The exposure is the greatest in areas of the print corresponding to clear parts of the negatives, which become the shadows or high density areas of the print.

This process is the formation of the latent image, as it forms an invisible image in the paper that is subsequently made visible by development. The paper is placed in the developer, which transforms the silver halide particles that have a latent image speck on them into metallic silver. Now the image is visible, but the remaining unexposed silver halide must still be removed to make the image permanent. But first the print is placed into the stop bath, which stops development and prevents the developer from contaminating the next bath: the fixer.

The fixer, typically sodium thiosulfate, is able to remove the unexposed silver halide by forming a water-soluble complex with it. And finally, a water wash sometimes preceded by a washing aid removes the fixer from the print, leaving an image composed of silver particles held in the clear gelatin image layer. Toning is sometimes used for permanence or aesthetic purposes and follows the fixing step. Selenium, gold, and sulfur toners are the most common and act by either partially converting the silver to another compound (such as silver selenide or silver sulfide) or partially replacing the silver with another metal (such as gold).

When small crystals (called &quot;grains&quot;) of silver salts such as silver bromide and silver chloride are exposed to light, a few atoms of free metallic silver are liberated. These free silver atoms form the &quot;latent image&quot;. This latent image is relatively stable and will persist for some months without degradation provided the film is kept dark and cool. Films are &quot;developed&quot; using solutions that reduce silver halides in the presence of free silver atoms. An &#x27;amplification&#x27; of the latent image occurs as the silver halides near the free silver atom are reduced to metallic silver. The strength, temperature and time for which the developer is allowed to act allow the photographer to control the contrast of the final image. The development is then &quot;stopped&quot; by neutralizing the developer in a second bath.

Once development is complete, the undeveloped silver salts must be removed by &quot;fixing&quot; in sodium thiosulphate or ammonium thiosulphate, and then the negative or print must be &quot;washed&quot; in clean water. The final image consists of metallic silver embedded in the gelatin coating.

All gelatin silver photographic materials are subject to deterioration. The silver particles that comprise the image are susceptible to oxidation, leading to yellowing and fading of the image. Poor processing can also result in various forms of image degradation, due to residual silver-thiosulfate complexes. Toning increases the stability of the silver image by coating the silver image with a less easily oxidized metal such as gold, or by converting portions of the silver image particles into more stable compounds, such as silver selenide or silver sulfide.

==Digital silver gelatin printing==

Also known as digital bromides, black and white silver gelatin prints imaged via digital output devices such as the Durst Lambda and the Oc√© LightJet, have been developed for the art market by Ilford Imaging. 

By adapting a large format paper processor in conjunction with the manufacturers, McLeod&#x27;s innovation led the way for the possibility of producing large resin coated (RC) and fibre based (FB) black and white prints. 

Ilford, in collaboration with Metro Imaging, London adapted their FB Galerie emulsion paper and its light sensitivity so that it would be receptive to full spectrum RGB laser channels.

== In molecular biology ==
An essentially identical procedure called &quot;silver staining&quot; is utilized in molecular biology to visualize DNA or proteins after gel electrophoresis, usually SDS-PAGE. The latent image is formed by the DNA or RNA or protein molecules (i.e. the reduced silver selectively precipitates onto those molecules). It is known for being nearly as sensitive as autoradiography, the &quot;gold standard&quot; technique, but one not widely used due to the use of radioactive materials.

<doc id="614742" wikidata="Q2749147" url="?curid=614742" title="Castellania">
<text>A castellania was the smallest administrative subdivision of land in medieval Malta, Poland, Hungary and the Netherlands, signifying the territory over which the master of a castle exercised his ordinary rights. At its centre was the castle, the most important place in the castellania, administered by a castellan (&quot;castellanus&quot; in Latin). In south-eastern France from the 11th century onwards such a subdivision was called a &quot;castellania&quot;, a &quot;ch√¢tellenie&quot; or a &quot;mandement&quot; (from the Latin &quot;mandamentum&quot;) and covered the administrative, military and financial functions of a territory held, exploited from and protected by a castle.

==Origins==
In France the term &quot;mandement&quot; or &quot;ch√¢tellenie&quot; were used for a new territory which gathered around a motte and bailey castle built by a member of the rural aristocracy after the failure of central power. They appeared very early on in the north of what is now the Dr√¥me d√©partement, more specifically in the Romanais, which during that period was overrun by around twelve motte and bailey castles, including eight outside the ancient Carolingians districts.

Over time the &quot;mandement&quot; became an admninistrative district in its own right and a name for an area. In the Romanais each mandement was of a reduced size and covered only two or three parishes - the largest, that of Peyrins, was made up of six parishes, the equivalent of four communes today.

==Feudal unit of the old royal domain==
The castellan was an officer appointed and paid by a count or prince. He could be dismissed or moved to head another castellania. His main function was as guardian of the castle and regularly having to present its accounts. He was also delegated to exercise all of the count or prince&#x27;s judicial and military rights. By extension and by tort, any owner of a castle (whether received, taken over as a fiefdom or raised on his allod) over which a lord exercised his rights was also called a castellan.

<doc id="614746" wikidata="Q966598" url="?curid=614746" title="USS Mitscher (DDG-57)">
<text>USS &quot;Mitscher&quot; (DDG-57) is the seventh (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in service with the United States Navy. It was constructed by Ingalls Shipbuilding, in Pascagoula, Mississippi on an order in December 1988. Laid down in 1992 it was formally commissioned on 10 December 1994.

== Namesake ==
USS &quot;Mitscher&quot; (DDG-57) became the second United States Navy warship named to honor Admiral Marc A. Mitscher (1887‚Äì1947), famed naval aviator and World War II aircraft carrier task force commander.

==Service history==
&quot;Mitscher&quot; was commissioned on 10 December 1994, and was sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Ferguson. &quot;Mitscher&quot; transferred to her homeport in Norfolk, Virginia later in December 1994, and has since made three Mediterranean deployments and participated in many Caribbean exercises. 
On 20 September 1998 a plaque was dedicated to &quot;Mitscher&quot; at Mahon (Naval) Cemetery where US and UK sailors lie at rest, some from various ships in the 1800s.

In 2001, &quot;Mitscher&quot; deployed with Carrier Group 2 centered on the aircraft carrier . In October 2006, &quot;Mitscher&quot; participated in Neptune Warrior, a joint war exercise with navies from all over the world.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Mitscher&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

Beginning 23 July 2011, during its 2011 deployment, the strike group&#x27;s anti-piracy capabilities was augmented by the addition of a U.S. Coast Guard 12-person Advanced Interdiction Team (AIT) embarked aboard &quot;Mitscher&quot;. These deployable Coast Guard boarding teams consisted of highly trained maritime law enforcement specialists capable of Level III non-compliant boardings. As the only organization in the U.S. government with the combined authority of a law enforcement agency, an intelligence agency, and a military service, they brought additional capabilities and expertise to &quot;Mitscher&quot;‚Ä≥s embarked visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) team. &quot;Mitscher&quot;‚Ä≥s VBSS team and the AIT trained together between operations to enhance their joint boarding tactics, boat operation skills, and internal movements.

On 13 August 2011, as part of Combined Task Force 150 operating in the Gulf of Aden, &quot;Mitscher&quot; provided assistance to the Sri Lankan-flagged cargo vessel &quot;Al Habib&quot; which was experiencing engineering problems and running low on water. &quot;Mitscher&quot;‚Ä≥s VBSS-AIT boarding party transported supplies to &quot;Al Habib&quot; via rigid-hulled inflatable boat, including two 3-gallon (11.36 liters) containers of water and four cases of bottled water.

On 24 February 2012 Commander Monika W. Stoker became the first African-American female to become the commanding officer of a U.S. destroyer. Commander Stoker relieved Commander Brian K. Sorrenson after serving as his executive officer for 20 months prior.

On 2 June 2015, &quot;Mitscher&quot; welcomed the in US waters on behalf of the US Navy.

On 16 April 2022, &quot;Mitscher&quot; arrived at Norfolk following a surge deployment.

On 9 August 2023, The Navy announced plans to extend the ship&#x27;s service life beyond the initial 35 years, intending to keep &quot;Mitscher&quot; in service until at least 2034.

== Coat of arms ==
The combined anchor and trident symbolize sea prowess and combat readiness. The life preserver ringing the anchor commemorates Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s compassion for his crew as manifested through his relentless determination in tracking down and recovering downed air crews. The three tines of the trident represent the ship&#x27;s significant capabilities in strike, air, and subsurface warfare. The trident&#x27;s position, rising above the crest, symbolizes the ability to project power over great distances. The gold wings represent Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s service and dedication, throughout his career, in advancing naval aviation and developing strike warfare.
Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy and represent the sea and excellence. Red is emblematic of sacrifice and valor. The cross throughout the shield recalls the Navy Cross Admiral Mitscher was awarded for his participation in the first successful transatlantic air passage. The two stars above the cross commemorate his awards of 2nd and 3rd Distinguished Service Medals and his 2nd and 3rd awards of the Navy Cross for meritorious service during operations in the Pacific during World War II. The armored gauntlet represents the strength and survivability of the ship. The lightning bolts symbolize energy and speed and the ability of the ship to conduct multi-mission operations in any dimension. The gauntlet grasping the lightning bolts highlights USS MITSCHER&#x27;s motto &quot;SEIZE THE DAY&quot;, recalling Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s tenacious fighting spirit and dignifying DDG 57&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Trastuzumab, sold under the brand name Herceptin among others, is a monoclonal antibody used to treat breast cancer and stomach cancer. It is specifically used for cancer that is HER2 receptor positive. It may be used by itself or together with other chemotherapy medication. Trastuzumab is given by slow injection into a vein and injection just under the skin.
Common side effects include fever, infection, cough, headache, trouble sleeping, and rash. Other severe side effects include heart failure, allergic reactions, and lung disease. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Trastuzumab works by binding to the HER2 receptor and slowing down cell replication.
Trastuzumab was approved for medical use in the United States in September 1998, and in the European Union in August 2000. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab-containing combination therapies (with chemotherapy, hormone blockers, or lapatinib) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The overall hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival and progression free survival were 0.82 and 0.61, respectively. It was difficult to accurately ascertain the true impact of trastuzumab on survival, as in three of the seven trials, over half of the patients in the control arm were allowed to cross-over and receive trastuzumab after their cancer began to progress. Thus, this analysis likely underestimates the true survival benefit associated with trastuzumab treatment in this population.

In early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab-containing regimens improved overall survival (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66) and disease-free survival (HR = 0.60). Increased risk of heart failure (RR = 5.11) and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (relative risk RR = 1.83) were seen in these trials as well. Two trials involving shorter term treatment with trastuzumab did not differ in efficacy from longer trials, but produced less cardiac toxicity.

The original studies of trastuzumab showed that it improved overall survival in late-stage (metastatic) HER2-positive breast cancer from 20.3 to 25.1 months. In early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, it reduces the risk of cancer returning after surgery. The absolute reduction in the risk of cancer returning within three years was 9.5%, and the absolute reduction in the risk of death within 3 years was reduced by 3%. However, it increases serious heart problems by an absolute risk of 2.1%, though the problems may resolve if treatment is stopped.

Trastuzumab has had a &quot;major impact in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.&quot; The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has been shown to increase both survival and response rate, in comparison to trastuzumab alone.

It is possible to determine the &quot;erbB2 status&quot; of a tumor, which can be used to predict efficacy of treatment with trastuzumab. If it is determined that a tumor is overexpressing the erbB2 oncogene and the patient has no significant pre-existing heart disease, then a patient is eligible for treatment with trastuzumab. It is surprising that although trastuzumab has great affinity for HER2 and high doses can be administered (because of its low toxicity), 70% of HER2+ patients do not respond to treatment. In fact resistance to the treatment develops rapidly, in virtually all patients. A mechanism of resistance involves failure to downregulate p27 (Kip1) as well as suppressing p27 translocation to the nucleus in breast cancer, enabling cdk2 to induce cell proliferation.

In May 2021, the FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of people with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

===Duration of treatment===
The optimal duration of add-on trastuzumab treatment after surgery for early breast cancer is unknown. One year of treatment is generally accepted based on clinical trial evidence that demonstrated the superiority of one-year treatment over none. However, a small Finnish trial also showed similar improvement with nine weeks of treatment over no therapy. Because of the lack of direct head-to-head comparison in clinical trials, it is unknown whether a shorter duration of treatment may be just as effective (with fewer side effects) than the accepted practice of treatment for one year. Debate about treatment duration has become a relevant issue for many public health policy makers because administering trastuzumab for a year is very expensive. Consequently, some countries with a taxpayer-funded public health system, such as New Zealand, chose to fund limited adjuvant therapy. However, subsequently New Zealand has revised its policy and now funds trastuzumab treatment for up to 12 months.

==Adverse effects==

Some of the common side effects of trastuzumab are flu-like symptoms (such as fever, chills and mild pain), nausea and diarrhea.

One of the more serious complications of trastuzumab is its effect on the heart, although this is rare. In 2‚Äì7% of cases, trastuzumab is associated with cardiac dysfunction, which includes congestive heart failure. As a result, regular cardiac screening with either a MUGA scan or echocardiography is commonly undertaken during the trastuzumab treatment period. The decline in ejection fraction appears to be reversible.

Trastuzumab downregulates neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), which is essential for the activation of cell survival pathways in cardiomyocytes and the maintenance of cardiac function. NRG-1 activates the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as focal adhesion kinases (FAK). These are all significant for the function and structure of cardiomyocytes. Trastuzumab can therefore lead to cardiac dysfunction.

Trastuzumab may harm a developing fetus.

==Mechanism of action==
The &quot;HER2&quot; gene (also known as &quot;HER2/neu&quot; and &quot;ErbB2&quot; gene) is amplified in 20‚Äì30% of early-stage breast cancers. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, inducing an immune-mediated response that causes internalization and recycling of HER2. It may also upregulate cell cycle inhibitors such as p21Waf1 and p27Kip1.

The HER2 pathway promotes cell growth and division when it is functioning normally; however, when it is overexpressed, cell growth accelerates beyond its normal limits. In some types of cancer, the pathway is exploited to promote rapid cell growth and proliferation and hence tumor formation. The EGF pathway includes the receptors HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and HER4; the binding of ligands (e.g. EGF etc.) to HER receptors is required to activate the pathway. The pathway initiates the MAP kinase pathway as well as the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway, which in turn activates the NF-Œ∫B pathway. In cancer cells the HER2 protein can be expressed up to 100 times more than in normal cells (2 million versus 20,000 per cell).

The HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell (molecules called EGFs) to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) protein, binds to human epidermal growth factor, and stimulates cell proliferation. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably.

HER2 is localized at the cell surface, and carries signals from outside the cell to the inside. Signaling compounds called mitogens (specifically EGF in this case) arrive at the cell membrane, and bind to the extracellular domain of the HER family of receptors. Those bound proteins then link (dimerize), activating the receptor. HER2 sends a signal from its intracellular domain, activating several different biochemical pathways. These include the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway. Signals on these pathways promote cell proliferation and the growth of blood vessels to nourish the tumor (angiogenesis). ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for the other family members and ERBB2 heterodimers signaling is stronger and longer acting compared to heterodimers between other ERBB members. It has been reported that Trastuzumab induces the formation of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) leading to surface redistribution of ERBB2 and EGFR in CDRs and that the ERBB2-dependent MAPK phosphorylation and EGFR/ERBB1 expression are both required for CDR formation. CDR formation requires activation of both the protein regulator of actin polymerization N-WASP, mediated by ERK1/2, and of the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin, mediated by EGFR/ERBB1. Furthermore, this latter event may be inhibited by the negative cell motility regulator p140Cap, as we found that p140Cap overexpression led to cofilin deactivation and inhibition of CDR formation.

Normal cell division‚Äîmitosis‚Äîhas checkpoints that keep cell division under control. Some of the proteins that control this cycle are called cdk2 (CDKs). Overexpression of HER2 sidesteps these checkpoints, causing cells to proliferate in an uncontrolled fashion.

Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of the extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to this region have been shown to reverse the phenotype of HER2/neu expressing tumor cells. Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab does not alter HER-2 expression, but downregulates activation of AKT. In addition, trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis both by induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. One of the most relevant proteins that trastuzumab activates is the tumor suppressor p27 (kip1), also known as CDKN1B. Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.

Experiments in laboratory animals indicate that antibodies, including trastuzumab, when bound to a cell, induce immune cells to kill that cell, and that such antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is another important mechanism of action.

==Predicting response==
Trastuzumab inhibits the effects of overexpression of HER2. If the breast cancer does not overexpress HER2, trastuzumab will have no beneficial effect (and may cause harm). Doctors use laboratory tests to discover whether HER2 is overexpressed. In the routine clinical laboratory, the most commonly employed methods for this are immunohistochemistry (IHC) and either silver, chromogenic or fluorescent in situ hybridisation (SISH/CISH/FISH). HER2 amplification can be detected by virtual karyotyping of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor. Virtual karyotyping has the added advantage of assessing copy number changes throughout the genome, in addition to detecting HER-2 amplification (but not overexpression). Numerous PCR-based methodologies have also been described in the literature. It is also possible to estimate &quot;HER2&quot; copy number from microarray data.

There are two FDA-approved commercial kits available for HER2 IHC; Dako HercepTest and Ventana Pathway.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is viewed as being the &quot;gold standard&quot; technique in identifying patients who would benefit from trastuzumab, but it is expensive and requires fluorescence microscopy and an image capture system. The main expense involved with CISH is in the purchase of FDA-approved kits, and as it is not a fluorescent technique it does not require specialist microscopy and slides may be kept permanently. Comparative studies of CISH and FISH have shown that these two techniques show excellent correlation. The lack of a separate chromosome 17 probe on the same section is an issue with regards to acceptance of CISH. As of June 2011 Roche has obtained FDA approval for the INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe cocktail developed by Ventana Medical Systems. The DDISH (Dual-chromagen/Dual-hapten In-situ hybridization) cocktail uses both HER2 and Chromosome 17 hybridization probes for chromagenic visualization on the same tissue section. The detection can be achieved by using a combination of ultraView SISH(silver in-situ hybridization) and ultraView Red ISH for deposition of distinct chromgenic precipitates at the site of DNP or DIG labeled probes.

== Resistance ==
One of the challenges in the treatment of breast cancer patients by herceptin is our understanding towards herceptin resistance. In the last decade, several assays have been performed to understand the mechanism of Herceptin resistance with/without supplementary drugs. Recently, all this information has been collected and compiled in form of a database HerceptinR.

==History==
The drug was first discovered by scientists including Axel Ullrich and H. Michael Shepard at Genentech, Inc. in South San Francisco, CA. Earlier discovery about the &quot;neu&quot; oncogene by Robert Weinberg&#x27;s lab and the monoclonal antibody recognizing the oncogenic receptor by Mark Greene&#x27;s lab also contributed to the establishment of HER2 targeted therapies. Dr. Dennis Slamon subsequently worked on trastuzumab&#x27;s development. A book about Dr. Slamon&#x27;s work was made into a television film called &quot;Living Proof&quot;, that premiered in 2008. Genentech developed trastuzumab jointly with UCLA, beginning the first clinical trial with 15 women in 1992. By 1996, clinical trials had expanded to over 900 women, but due to pressure from advocates based on early success, Genentech worked with the FDA to begin a lottery system allowing 100 women each quarter access to the medication outside the trials. Herceptin was Fast-tracked by the FDA and gained approval in September 1998.

Biocon Ltd and its partner Mylan obtained regulatory approval to sell a biosimilar in 2014, but Roche contested the legality of the approval; that litigation ended in 2016, and Biocon and Mylan each introduced their own branded biosimilars.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
Trastuzumab costs about for a full course of treatment.

Australia has negotiated a lower price of A$50,000 per course of treatment.

Since October 2006, trastuzumab has been made available for Australian women and men with early-stage breast cancer via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is estimated to cost the country over A$470 million for 4‚Äì5 years supply of the drug.

Roche has agreed with Emcure in India to make an affordable version of this cancer drug available to the Indian market.

Roche has changed the brand name of the drug and has re-introduced an affordable version of the same in the Indian market. The new drug named Herclon would cost approximately RS75,000 INR (1,200) in the Indian market.

On 16 September 2014, Genentech notified hospitals in the United States that, as of October, trastuzumab could only be purchased through their selected specialty drugs distributors not through the usual general line wholesalers. By being forced to purchase through specialty pharmacies, hospitals lost rebates from the big wholesalers and the ability to negotiate cost-minus discounts with their wholesalers.

===Biosimilars===
By 2014, around 20 companies, particularly from emerging markets, were developing biosimilar versions of trastuzumab
after Roche/Genentech&#x27;s patents expired in 2014 in Europe, and in 2019 in the United States.

In January 2015, BIOCAD announced the first trastuzumab biosimilar approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Iran also approved its own version of the monoclonal antibody in January 2016, as AryoTrust, and announced its readiness to export the drug to other countries in the Middle-East and Central Asia when trade sanctions were lifted.

In 2016, the investigational biosimilar MYL-1401O showed comparable efficacy and safety to the Herceptin branded trastuzumab. Trastuzumab-dkst (Ogivri, Mylan GmbH) was approved in the United States in December 2017, to &quot;treat people with breast cancer or gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose tumors overexpress the HER-2 gene.&quot; Ogivri was authorized for medical use in the European Union in December 2018.

In November 2017, the European Commission authorized Ontruzant, a biosimilar from Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd, for the treatment of early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. Ontruzant is the first trastuzumab biosimilar to receive regulatory approval in the European Union.

Herzuma was authorized for medical use in the European Union in February 2018. Herzuma, a trastuzumab biosimilar, was approved in the United States in December 2018. The approval was based on comparisons of extensive structural and functional product characterization, animal data, human pharmacokinetic, clinical immunogenicity, and other clinical data demonstrating that Herzuma is biosimilar to US Herceptin. Herzuma has been approved as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product.

Kanjinti was authorized for medical use in the European Union in May 2018.

Trazimera was authorized for medical use in the European Union in July 2018.

Ogivri was approved for medical use in Canada in May 2019.

Trazimera was approved for medical use in Canada in August 2019.

Herzuma was approved for medical use in Canada in September 2019.

Kanjinti was approved for medical use in Canada in February 2020.

Zercepac was authorized for medical use in the European Union in July 2020.

Trastucip and Tuzucip were approved for medical use in Australia in July 2022.

In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Herwenda, intended for the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Sandoz GmbH. Herwenda was authorized for medical use in the European Union in November 2023.

Trastuzumab-strf (Hercessi) was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2024.

In July 2024, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Tuznue, intended for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Prestige Biopharma Belgium BVBA. Tuznue is a biosimilar medicinal product. Tuznue was authorized for medical use in the European Union in September 2024.

Adheroza was approved for medical use in Canada in August 2024.

<text>The Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (; abbreviated MPG) is a formally independent non-governmental and non-profit association of German research institutes. Founded in 1911 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, it was renamed to the Max Planck Society in 1948 in honor of its former president, theoretical physicist Max Planck. The society is funded by the federal and state governments of Germany.

==Mission==
According to its primary goal, the Max Planck Society supports fundamental research in the natural, life and social sciences, the arts and humanities in its 84 (as of January 2024) Max Planck Institutes. The society has a total staff of approximately 17,000 permanent employees, including 5,470 scientists, plus around 4,600 non-tenured scientists and guests. The society&#x27;s budget for 2018 was about ‚Ç¨1.8 billion. As of 31 December 2018, the Max Planck Society employed a total of 23,767 staff, of whom 15,650 were scientists. 44.4% were female employees and 31.5% of all of the employees were foreign nationals.

The Max Planck Society has a world-leading reputation as a science and technology research organization, with 39 Nobel Prizes awarded to their scientists, and is widely regarded as one of the foremost basic research organizations in the world. In 2020, the Nature Index placed the Max Planck Institutes third worldwide in terms of research published in &quot;Nature&quot; journals (after the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harvard University). In terms of total research volume (unweighted by citations or impact), the Max Planck Society is only outranked by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences and Harvard University in the Times Higher Education institutional rankings. The Thomson Reuters-Science Watch website placed the Max Planck Society as the second leading research organization worldwide following Harvard University in terms of the impact of the produced research over science fields.

The Max Planck Society and its predecessor Kaiser Wilhelm Society hosted several renowned scientists in their fields, including Otto Hahn, Werner Heisenberg, and Albert Einstein.

The Max Planck Society also hosts the &quot;Cornell, Maryland, and Max Planck Pre-Doctoral Research School&quot;, an intense week of lectures, informal conversations with guest faculty and fellow students from all over the world, professional development panels with academic and industrial speakers, research poster sessions, and social events.

==History==

The organization was established in 1911 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, or &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft&quot; (KWG), a non-governmental research organization named for the then German emperor. The KWG was one of the world&#x27;s leading research organizations; its board of directors included scientists like Walther Bothe, Peter Debye, Albert Einstein, and Fritz Haber. In 1946, Otto Hahn assumed the position of president of KWG, and in 1948, the society was renamed the Max Planck Society (MPG) after its former president (1930‚Äì37) Max Planck, who died in 1947.

The Max Planck Society has a world-leading reputation as a science and technology research organization. In 2006, the Times Higher Education Supplement rankings of non-university research institutions (based on international peer review by academics) placed the Max Planck Society as No.1 in the world for science research, and No.3 in technology research (behind AT&amp;T Corporation and the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States).

The domain &quot;mpg.de&quot; attracted at least 1.7 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study.

==Max Planck Research Award==
From 1990 to 2004, the &quot;Max Planck Research Award for International Cooperation&quot; was presented to several researchers from a wide range of disciplines each year.

From 2004 to 2017, the &quot;Max Planck Research Award&quot; was conferred annually to two internationally renowned scientists, one of whom was working in Germany and one in another country. Calls for nominations for the award were invited on an annually rotating basis in specific sub-areas of the natural sciences and engineering, the life sciences, and the human and social sciences. The objective of the Max Planck Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in presenting this joint research award was to give added momentum to specialist fields that were either not yet established in Germany or that deserved to be expanded.

Since 2018, the award has been succeeded by the &quot;Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award&quot;, annually awarded to an internationally renowned mid-career researcher with outstanding future potential from outside Germany but having a strong interest in a research residency in Germany for limited time periods, alternately in the fields of natural and engineering sciences, human sciences, and life sciences, as well as the &quot;Max Planck-Humboldt Medal&quot; awarded to other two finalists.

==Organization==

The Max Planck Society is formally an &quot;eingetragener Verein&quot;, a registered association with the institute directors as scientific members having equal voting rights. The society has its registered seat in Berlin, while the administrative headquarters are located in Munich. Since June 2014, materials scientist Martin Stratmann has been the President of the Max Planck Society.

Funding is provided predominantly from federal and state sources, but also from research and license fees and donations. One of the larger donations was the castle Schloss Ringberg near Kreuth in Bavaria, which was pledged by Luitpold Emanuel in Bayern (Duke in Bavaria). It passed to the Society after the duke died in 1973, and is now used for conferences.

===Max Planck Institutes and research groups===

The Max Planck Society consists of over 80 research institutes. In addition, the society funds a number of Max Planck Research Groups (MPRG) and International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS). The purpose of establishing independent research groups at various universities is to strengthen the required networking between universities and institutes of the Max Planck Society.

The research units are primarily located across Europe with a few in South Korea and the U.S. In 2007, the Society established its first non-European centre, with an institute on the Jupiter campus of Florida Atlantic University focusing on neuroscience.

The Max Planck Institutes operate independently from, though in close cooperation with, the universities, and focus on innovative research that does not fit into the university structure due to its interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary nature or that require resources that cannot be met by the state universities.

Internally, Max Planck Institutes are organized into research departments headed by directors such that each MPI has several directors, a position roughly comparable to anything from full professor to department head at a university. Other core members include Junior and Senior Research Fellows.

In addition, there are several associated institutes:
Max Planck Society also has a collaborative center with Princeton University‚ÄîMax Planck Princeton Research Center for Plasma Physics‚Äîlocated in Princeton, New Jersey, in the U.S. The latest Max Planck Research Center has been established at Harvard University in 2016 as the Max Planck Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean.

== Open access publishing ==

The Max Planck Society describes itself as &quot;a co-founder of the international Open Access movement&quot;. Together with the European Cultural Heritage Online Project the Max Planck Society organized the Berlin Open Access Conference in October 2003 to ratify the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing. At the Conference the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities was passed. The Berlin Declaration built on previous open access declarations, but widened the research field to be covered by open access to include humanities and called for new activities to support open access such as ‚Äúencouraging the holders of cultural heritage‚Äù to provide open access to their resources.

The Max Planck Society continues to support open access in Germany and mandates institutional self-archiving of research outputs on the eDoc server and publications by its researchers in open access journals within 12 months. To finance open access the Max Planck Society established the Max Planck Digital Library. The library also aims to improve the conditions for open access on behalf of all Max Planck Institutes by negotiating contracts with open access publishers and developing infrastructure projects, such as the Max Planck open access repository.

== Criticism ==
=== Pay for PhD students ===
In 2008, the European General Court ruled in a case brought by a PhD student against the Max Planck Society that &quot;a researcher preparing a doctoral thesis on the basis of a grant contract concluded with the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaften eV, must be regarded as a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC only if his activities are performed for a certain period of time under the direction of an institute forming part of that association and if, in return for those activities, he receives remuneration&quot;.

In 2012, the Max Planck Society was at the centre of a controversy about some PhD students not being given employment contracts. Of the 5,300 students who at the time wrote their PhD thesis at the 80 Max Planck Institutes 2,000 had an employment contract. The remaining 3,300 received grants of between 1,000 and 1,365 Euro. According to a 2011 statement by the Max Planck Society &quot;As you embark on a PhD, you are still anything but a &quot;proper&quot; scientist; it‚Äôs during the process itself that you become a &quot;proper&quot; scientist... a PhD is &quot;an apprenticeship in the lab&quot;, and as such it is usually not paid like a &quot;proper&quot; job ‚Äì and this is, by and large, the practice at all research institutions and universities&quot;. The allegation of wage dumping for young scientists was discussed during the passing of the 2012 &quot;Wissenschaftsfreiheitsgesetz&quot; (Scientific Freedom Law) in the German Parliament.

=== Freedom of expression ===
In February 2024, the Max Planck Society faced widespread criticism for terminating the employment of Lebanese-Australian professor Ghassan Hage from the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, citing his social media posts on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict as incompatible with the society&#x27;s core values. This decision was publicly condemned by numerous scholars and academic organizations, who argued it infringed on Hage&#x27;s freedom of expression. German newspaper Welt am Sonntag initially reported on Hage&#x27;s posts. Following the dismissal, global academic communities, including Israeli scholars, the German Association of Social and Cultural Anthropology, the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies, the European Association of Social Anthropologists, the American Anthropological Association, the Council for Humanities, Arts and Sciences and the Australian Anthropological Society, the Canadian Anthropology Society, a Japanese group of scholars, the Australian Sociological Association, rallied in support of Hage, extensively citing Hage&#x27;s own intellectual work, urging the society to reverse its decision. The Max Planck Society and the President Patrick Cramer have not yet respond to these letters, as of July 2024. The Max Planck Society&#x27;s has made public statements expressing support for the state of Israel in the Israel‚ÄìHamas war.

<text>The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. It is the electric-field analogue of the Zeeman effect, where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of the magnetic field. Although initially coined for the static case, it is also used in the wider context to describe the effect of time-dependent electric fields. In particular, the Stark effect is responsible for the pressure broadening (Stark broadening) of spectral lines by charged particles in plasmas. For most spectral lines, the Stark effect is either linear (proportional to the applied electric field) or quadratic with a high accuracy.

The Stark effect can be observed both for emission and absorption lines. The latter is sometimes called the inverse Stark effect, but this term is no longer used in the modern literature.

==History==
The effect is named after the German physicist Johannes Stark, who discovered it in 1913. It was independently discovered in the same year by the Italian physicist Antonino Lo Surdo. The discovery of this effect contributed importantly to the development of quantum theory and Stark was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 1919.

Inspired by the magnetic Zeeman effect, and especially by Hendrik Lorentz&#x27;s explanation of it, Woldemar Voigt performed classical mechanical calculations of quasi-elastically bound electrons in an electric field. By using experimental indices of refraction he gave an estimate of the Stark splittings. This estimate was a few orders of magnitude too low. Not deterred by this prediction, Stark undertook measurements on excited states of the hydrogen atom and succeeded in observing splittings.

By the use of the Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld (&quot;old&quot;) quantum theory, Paul Epstein and Karl Schwarzschild were independently able to derive equations for the linear and quadratic Stark effect in hydrogen. Four years later, Hendrik Kramers derived formulas for intensities of spectral transitions. Kramers also included the effect of fine structure, with corrections for relativistic kinetic energy and coupling between electron spin and orbital motion. The first quantum mechanical treatment (in the framework of Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics) was by Wolfgang Pauli. Erwin Schr√∂dinger discussed at length the Stark effect in his third paper on quantum theory (in which he introduced his perturbation theory), once in the manner of the 1916 work of Epstein (but generalized from the old to the new quantum theory) and once by his (first-order) perturbation approach.
Finally, Epstein reconsidered the linear and quadratic Stark effect from the point of view of the new quantum theory. He derived equations for the line intensities which were a decided improvement over Kramers&#x27;s results obtained by the old quantum theory.

While the first-order-perturbation (linear) Stark effect in hydrogen is in agreement with both the old Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld model and the quantum-mechanical theory of the atom, higher-order corrections are not. Measurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths confirmed the correctness of the new quantum theory.

==Mechanism==

===Overview===
Imagine an atom with occupied 2s and 2p electron states. In the Bohr model, these states are degenerate. However, in the presence of an external electric field, these electron orbitals will hybridize into eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian (where each perturbed hybrid state can be written as a superpositon of unperturbed states). Since the 2s and 2p states have opposite parity, these hybrid states will lack inversion symmetry and will possess a time-averaged electric dipole moment. If this dipole moment is aligned with the electric field, the energy of the state will shift down; if this dipole moment is anti-aligned with the electric field, the energy of the state will shift up. Thus, the Stark effect causes a splitting of the original degeneracy. 

Other things being equal, the effect of the electric field is greater for outer electron shells because the electron is more distant from the nucleus, resulting in a larger electric dipole moment upon hybridization. 

===Multipole expansion===
The Stark effect originates from the interaction between a charge distribution (atom or molecule) and an external electric field.
The interaction energy of a continuous charge distribution formula_1, confined within a finite volume formula_2, with an external electrostatic potential formula_3 is 
formula_4
This expression is valid classically and quantum-mechanically alike.
If the potential varies weakly over the charge distribution, the multipole expansion converges fast, so only a few first terms give an accurate approximation. Namely, keeping only the zero- and first-order terms,
formula_5
where we introduced the electric field formula_6 and assumed the origin 0 to be somewhere within formula_2.
Therefore, the interaction becomes
formula_8
where formula_9 and formula_10 are, respectively, the total charge (zero moment) and the dipole moment of the charge distribution.

Classical macroscopic objects are usually neutral or quasi-neutral (formula_11), so the first, monopole, term in the expression above is identically zero. This is also the case for a neutral atom or molecule. However, for an ion this is no longer true. Nevertheless, it is often justified to omit it in this case, too. Indeed, the Stark effect is observed in spectral lines, which are emitted when an electron &quot;jumps&quot; between two bound states. Since such a transition only alters the internal degrees of freedom of the radiator but not its charge, the effects of the monopole interaction on the initial and final states exactly cancel each other.

===Perturbation theory===
Turning now to quantum mechanics an atom or a molecule can be thought of as a collection of point charges (electrons and nuclei), so that the second definition of the dipole applies. The interaction of atom or molecule with a uniform external field is described by the operator
formula_12
This operator is used as a perturbation in first- and second-order perturbation theory to account for the first- and second-order Stark effect.

====First order====
Let the unperturbed atom or molecule be in a &quot;g&quot;-fold degenerate state with orthonormal zeroth-order state functions formula_13. (Non-degeneracy is the special case &quot;g&quot; = 1). According to perturbation theory the first-order energies are the eigenvalues of the &quot;g&quot; √ó &quot;g&quot; matrix with general element 
formula_14
If &quot;g&quot; = 1 (as is often the case for electronic states of molecules) the first-order energy becomes proportional to the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator formula_15,
formula_16Since the electric dipole moment is a vector (tensor of the first rank), the diagonal elements of the perturbation matrix Vint vanish between states that have a definite parity. Atoms and molecules possessing inversion symmetry do not have a (permanent) dipole moment and hence do not show a linear Stark effect.

In order to obtain a non-zero matrix Vint for systems with an inversion center it is necessary that some of the unperturbed functions formula_17 have opposite parity (obtain plus and minus under inversion), because only functions of opposite parity give non-vanishing matrix elements. Degenerate zeroth-order states of opposite parity occur for excited hydrogen-like (one-electron) atoms or Rydberg states. Neglecting fine-structure effects, such a state with the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;2-fold degenerate and
formula_18
where formula_19 is the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number. For instance, the excited &quot;n&quot; = 4 state contains the following formula_20 states,
formula_21
The one-electron states with even formula_20 are even under parity, while those with odd formula_20 are odd under parity. Hence hydrogen-like atoms with &quot;n&quot;&gt;1 show first-order Stark effect.

The first-order Stark effect occurs in rotational transitions of symmetric top molecules (but not for linear and asymmetric molecules). In first approximation a molecule may be seen as a rigid rotor. A symmetric top rigid rotor has the unperturbed eigenstates
formula_24
with 2(2&quot;J&quot;+1)-fold degenerate energy for |K| &gt; 0 and (2&quot;J&quot;+1)-fold degenerate energy for K=0.
Here &quot;D&quot;&quot;J&quot;&quot;MK&quot; is an element of the Wigner D-matrix. The first-order perturbation matrix on basis of the unperturbed rigid rotor function is non-zero and can be diagonalized. This gives shifts and splittings
in the rotational spectrum. Quantitative analysis of these Stark shift yields the permanent electric dipole moment of the symmetric top molecule.

====Second order====
As stated, the quadratic Stark effect is described by second-order perturbation theory. The zeroth-order eigenproblem
formula_25
is assumed to be solved. The perturbation theory gives
formula_26
with the components of the polarizability tensor Œ± defined by
formula_27
The energy &quot;E&quot;(2) gives the quadratic Stark effect.

Neglecting the hyperfine structure (which is often justified ‚Äî unless extremely weak electric fields are considered), the polarizability tensor of atoms is isotropic,
formula_28
For some molecules this expression is a reasonable approximation, too.

For the ground state formula_29 is &quot;always&quot; positive, i.e., the quadratic Stark shift is always negative.

====Problems====
The perturbative treatment of the Stark effect has some problems. In the presence of an electric field, states of atoms and molecules that were previously bound (square-integrable), become formally (non-square-integrable) resonances of finite width. These resonances may decay in finite time via field ionization. For low lying states and not too strong fields the decay times are so long, however, that for all practical purposes the system can be regarded as bound. For highly excited states and/or very strong fields ionization may have to be accounted for. (See also the article on the Rydberg atom).

==Applications==
The Stark effect is at the basis of the spectral shift measured for voltage-sensitive dyes used for imaging of the firing activity of neurons.

<doc id="614765" wikidata="Q733571" url="?curid=614765" title="PZL P.7">
<text>The PZLP.7 was a Polish gull wing monoplane fighter aircraft designed in the early 1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw. It was the main fighter of the Polish Air Force between 1933 and 1935. The PZLP.7 was replaced in Polish service by its follow-up design, the PZLP.11c. More than 30 PZLP.7 fighters remained in service during the Invasion of Poland, scoring several kills despite its obsolescence.
==Design and development==
The history of the PZL P.7 began in 1928, when a talented designer named Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski designed an all-metal, metal-covered monoplane fighter, the PZL P.1. It introduced a high gull wing whose design was called the &quot;Polish wing&quot; or &quot;Pulawski wing.&quot; The P.1 was powered by an inline engine and developed a speed of . But it remained a prototype because a decision was made to use a licence-produced radial engine in the Polish Air Force fighters. So the next model, the PZL P.6, flown in August 1930, was powered by the Bristol Jupiter VI FH radial engine. Both aircraft were well received and it won the American National Air Races in August‚ÄìSeptember 1931.

The PZL P.6 did not enter production because a more advanced variant, the PZL P.7, was in development. The first prototype was basically a P.6 with a more powerful Bristol Jupiter VII.F engine. The addition of a supercharger improved performance at higher altitudes. The prototype P.7/I was first flown in October 1930 by Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski. Initially, engine cylinders had individual cylinder fairings. After numerous changes, most noticeably the addition of a wide Townend ring to the engine, and a higher aspect tail, the second prototype P.7/II which had been completed in autumn 1931, was accepted for production with the designation P.7a. The wing was redesigned with slightly increased span, taken from the PZL P.8, and shorter ailerons were used, and structural changes eliminated external ribs from the wing upper surfaces. P.7a production began in mid-1932 and the last of the 149 (plus two prototypes) were completed in 1933. The Polish Air Force received the P.7a in 1933.

Pu≈Çawski continued to develop the basic design by adding more powerful engines, which resulted in the PZL P.11. Pu≈Çawski preferred inline engines and also designed the slimmer P.8 and the related P.9 with inline engines but he died in an air accident in March 1931, and these were cancelled. The P.11 became the standard Polish fighter while the PZL P.24 was developed in parallel as an export variant in 1932.

===Technical features===
The all-metal, duralumin metal-covered strut braced gull-wing monoplane was conventional in layout, and used a conventional fixed undercarriage with a tail skid. The two-spar trapezoid wing was thinner by the fuselage and was covered with a ribbed Wibault type duralumin sheet (although the upper surfaces were smooth) and braced by two struts on each side. The fuselage was framed in a front section and semi-monocoque in mid- and tail sections, oval in cross-section. In keeping with the period, the pilot&#x27;s cockpit was open with a windshield. Armament was two machine guns mounted on the fuselage sides which replaced the initially fitted Vickers E which were re-bored. The aircraft was powered by a Bristol Jupiter VII F radial engine fitted with a Townend ring and two-blade propeller. A main fuel tank in the fuselage, behind the engine could be dropped in case of fire emergency. The second fuel tank was .

==Operational history==
The PZL P.7a entered service in spring 1933, replacing PWS-A (a licence-built Avia BH-33) and PWS-10 fighters. Consequently, the Polish Air Force became the first air force entirely equipped with all-metal monococque fighters. When the P.7 entered service, it was comparable to contemporary designs, but due to rapid progress, it was obsolete by 1939. From 1935, the PZL P.11 replaced the P.7 in most combat units, but was only a slight improvement, while the P.7as were relegated to air schools.

At the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force still had 30 PZL P.7a fighters in combat units. A further 40 were with flying schools, and 35 were in reserve or undergoing repairs for a total of 106 aircraft. The P.7as were used by three squadrons, each equipped with 10 aircraft. The Pursuit Brigade&#x27;s 123rd Squadron was deployed near Warsaw, while the 151st and the 162nd Squadrons were attached to Army units. Despite being obsolete, they engaged the German attackers during the invasion of Poland. In addition to combat units, at least 18 P.7a fighters were used by improvised units from air bases in Dƒôblin and U≈Çƒô≈º.

Although the P.7 was more manoeuvrable than their opponents and could operate from short or rough fields, almost all the German aircraft were faster, and worse, the Polish aircraft and their engines were worn out from intensive service use. Their two machine guns was also inadequate and jammed frequently while only some replaced the vintage Vickers with the better . Pilots flying the P.7a claimed to have shot down seven German aircraft (two Heinkel He 111s, two Dornier Do 17s, one Henschel Hs 126 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110s), against 22 losses.

Most were destroyed in 1939, in combat or on the ground, but around a dozen were withdrawn to Romania, but were not used in combat there. Some captured P.7s were used by the Germans for training. Several aircraft were captured by the Soviets and were also assigned to training units.

<text>Double Fantasy is the fifth studio album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and the final one before Lennon&#x27;s death. Released in November 1980 on Geffen Records, the album marked Lennon&#x27;s return to recording music full-time, following his five-year hiatus to raise his son Sean. Recording sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City between August and October 1980. The final album features songs from both Lennon and Ono, largely alternating between the two in its track listing. Other tracks recorded by Lennon from the sessions were compiled by Ono for release on &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; in 1984.

Upon its release, the album stalled on music charts and received largely negative reviews from music critics, with many focusing on the album&#x27;s idealisation of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s marriage. However, following Lennon&#x27;s murder three weeks after its release, it became a worldwide commercial success and went on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In subsequent decades, the album has been viewed favourably, with Lennon&#x27;s songs in particular garnering praise as some of his finest.

In 2010, Ono and Douglas released a remix of the album, titled &quot;Double Fantasy Stripped Down&quot;, which featured less lavish production than the original.

==Background==
Following the birth of his son, Sean, in 1975, Lennon put his musical career on hold to raise him. After five years of little musical activity, aside from recording the occasional demo in his apartment in New York, Lennon resumed his career.

In June 1980, Lennon embarked on a sailing trip from Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda. During the journey, the 43-foot schooner named &quot;Megan Jaye&quot; encountered a severe storm. One by one, the crew of five were overcome with fatigue and seasickness save for Lennon, who was eventually forced to take the helm alone for six hours. It had the effect of both renewing his confidence and making him contemplate the fragility of life. As a result, he began to write new songs and reworked earlier demos. He commented later, &quot;I was so centred after the experience at sea that I was tuned in to the cosmos ‚Äì and all these songs came!&quot; Ono also wrote many songs, inspired with new confidence after Lennon had stated that he believed that contemporary popular music, such as &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; by the B-52&#x27;s, bore similarities to Ono&#x27;s earlier work.

The couple decided to release their work on the same album, the first time they had done so since 1972&#x27;s politically charged &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. In stark contrast to that album, &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Heart Play&quot;) was a collection of songs wherein husband and wife would conduct a musical dialogue. The album took its title from a species of freesia, seen in the Bermuda Botanical Gardens, whose name Lennon regarded as a perfect description of his marriage to Ono.

Lennon was also inspired to return to music by his former songwriting partner within the Beatles. Upon hearing former bandmate Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Coming Up&quot;, Lennon deemed the song &quot;a good piece of work.&quot; According to McCartney, the track prompted Lennon to return to recording later that year.

==Recording==
Ono approached producer Jack Douglas, with whom the couple had previously worked, and gave him Lennon&#x27;s demos to listen to. &quot;My immediate impressions were that I was going to have a hard time making it better than the demos because there was such intimacy in the demos,&quot; Douglas told &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s Chris Hunt in 2005.

Sessions for the album began at the Hit Factory in New York City on 7 August 1980 and continued until 19 October 1980. Lennon and Ono were rarely in the studio at the same time, primarily because Ono did not want Lennon imposing himself in her work. They produced dozens of songs, enough to fill &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and a large part of a projected second album, &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;.

Lennon wanted to work with different musicians than he had previously, and had Douglas assemble and rehearse the band without telling them who they would be recording with. While the sessions were underway, Douglas brought Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos of the band Cheap Trick (whom he was also producing) to play on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; and Ono&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot;, but these were eventually re-recorded with the studio musicians. The Cheap Trick version of &quot;I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; was included on the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot; collection released in 1998.

The sessions remained top secret. According to Douglas, this was because Lennon was not confident in his work, feeling that he was out of touch with the contemporary music scene and could no longer write or sing up to the standard he set in his heyday, and wanted to be able to discreetly abort the sessions if he felt they were not turning out well; at one point he spoke of giving most of the songs he wrote for the album to his ex-bandmate Ringo Starr. Lennon and Ono still were not signed to a record label and paid for the initial sessions themselves. After they were satisfied with the album, their publicist Bruce Replogle leaked the news that the couple were back in the studio again.

Immediately, Lennon was inundated with offers from all the major labels. The recording industry was shocked when the couple signed with the newly formed Geffen Records on 22 September 1980 because David Geffen shrewdly insisted on speaking with Ono first and regarded her contributions as equal to Lennon&#x27;s. He signed them before hearing any of the tracks.

==Release, reception and aftermath==
The album was preceded by the single &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot;, which was backed with Ono&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Kiss Kiss&quot;. It was released on 20 October 1980 in the United States, and four days later in the United Kingdom. Originally peaking at number 8 in the UK chart, after Lennon&#x27;s murder the single reached number one. In the US, the single was inching upward in the top 10 before reaching number one following Lennon&#x27;s death.

The album was released on 17 November 1980 in both the UK and US. Geffen had planned an elaborate cover for Lennon&#x27;s comeback, but Ono could not decide on a photo. Not wanting to miss the Christmas release deadline, Geffen used the single sleeve as the front cover, while choosing an outtake from the same photo session for the back. The tracks were sequenced as a dialogue between Lennon and Ono; one of his songs followed by one of hers. On the initial pressings, the track listing was out of sequence on the album cover. Initial sales were sluggish. In the UK album charts, it had peaked at number 14 then slipped to number 46, while in the US, it had risen to number 11. Upon Lennon&#x27;s murder, the album jumped to number 1 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, where it stayed for eight weeks, and in the UK, it jumped to number 2, where it remained for seven weeks before finally spending two weeks at number 1. 

&quot;Woman&quot;, chosen by Lennon, was released as a posthumous single, backed with Ono&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Boys&quot;. It was released on 12 January 1981 in the US and 16 January in the UK, reaching number 1 in the UK and in the US on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; singles chart, while peaking at number 2 for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. Released as the final single from the album, &quot;Watching the Wheels&quot;, backed with Ono&#x27;s &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot;, peaked at number 10 and 30 in the US and UK charts respectively. The single was released in the US on 13 March 1981, and on 27 March 1981 in the UK.

Lennon&#x27;s Bermuda trip and &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; inspired the 2013 tribute CD and book &quot;Lennon Bermuda&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===

Initial critical reaction to the album was largely negative. The negative reviews focused on the album&#x27;s idealisation of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s marriage. Kit Rachlis of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; admitted to being &quot;annoyed&quot; by Lennon and Ono&#x27;s assumption &quot;that lots of people care deeply&quot; about them. Charles Shaar Murray, of &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, wrote that the couple&#x27;s domestic bliss &quot;sounds like a great life but unfortunately it makes a lousy record,&quot; adding that he wished Lennon had &quot;kept his big happy trap shut until he has something to say that was even vaguely relevant to those of us not married to Yoko Ono.&quot;

Three weeks after the album&#x27;s release, Lennon was murdered and several negative reviews by prominent critics were withheld from publication, including those by Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Tom Carson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and Geoffrey Stokes of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (Stokes had found the concept and theme to be &quot;basically misogynist&quot;). 

&quot;Double Fantasy&quot; finished 37th in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;‚Ä≥s 1980 Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of prominent music critics. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it 7th on his own list of the year&#x27;s best albums. Although he was put off by its simplistic lyrics and music upon first listen, Christgau said the music works a &quot;minor miracle&quot; with &quot;rich, precise&quot; song form and a &quot;command of readymades&quot; to put &quot;the anonymous usages of studio rock to striking artistic purpose&quot;. He felt that the use of alternating Ono&#x27;s improved vocals with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;makes the union come alive&quot; better than his outspoken, straightforward lyrics and concluded that the album is not great but &quot;memorable and gratifying&quot; as rare, &quot;connubial rock and roll&quot;. In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments: &quot;these are really nice tunes and what&#x27;s special about them is their niceness ‚Äì it&#x27;s a sweet acceptance of middle age, which, of course, makes [Lennon&#x27;s] assassination all the sadder.&quot;

In 1982, Douglas, Lennon and Ono won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year for &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards. In 1989, the album was ranked number 29 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s.

In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list, praising Lennon and Ono for their collaboration as &quot;each song acts as a dialogue between the couple.&quot;

===Lawsuit===
In 1984, Douglas filed a lawsuit against Ono over unpaid royalties for his work on &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;. Douglas recounted in a 1999 interview, &quot;I waited like three years, then I finally said to Yoko, &#x27;It&#x27;s really a lot of royalties probably accruing here ... You don&#x27;t have to deal with it, let&#x27;s just sort it out, let our people sort it out.&#x27; And I got like a nasty letter, almost like, &#x27;Fuck you, you&#x27;re not getting anything.&#x27;&quot; A jury ruled that Ono had wrongfully withheld royalty payments from Douglas and that he was entitled to $2.5 million from revenues for &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and an undetermined share of revenues from &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;.

===Reissues===
&quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)&quot; was re-released as the B-side to a reissue of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; to promote &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot; in November 1982. It was first released on CD on 13 October 1986 in the UK, and nearly a year later on 15 September 1987 in the US. The album was re-released on cassette, CD and vinyl in 1989, after EMI had obtained the rights to the album. On 9 October 2000, EMI/Capitol released a remastered version of the album, containing three bonus tracks.

In 2010, Ono and Douglas supervised the release of a remix of the album called &quot;Double Fantasy Stripped Down&quot;. Released as a two-disc set, it included a newly remastered copy of the original album along with an alternative version of the album featuring simpler arrangements without the original&#x27;s lavish production, with cover artwork by Sean Lennon. Ono said of the remix: &quot;This new version really allows us to focus our attention on John&#x27;s amazing vocals. Technology has advanced so much that, conversely, I wanted to use new techniques to really frame these amazing songs and John‚Äôs voice as simply as possible. By stripping down some of the instrumentation, the power of the songs shines through with an enhanced clarity.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave the remix a negative review, commenting that because &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; was envisioned from the beginning as a polished studio production, the remix feels like after-the-fact tinkering with an album that had already been presented in its best possible form. He also found the changes for the most part inconsequential, with little effect on the overall impact.

<text>USG Corporation, also known as United States Gypsum Corporation, is an American company which manufactures construction materials, most notably drywall and joint compound. The company is the largest distributor of wallboard in the United States and the largest manufacturer of gypsum products in North America. It is also a major consumer of synthetic gypsum, a byproduct of flue-gas desulfurization. Its corporate offices are located at 550 West Adams Street in Chicago, Illinois.

USG&#x27;s most significant brands include Sheetrock Brand Gypsum Panels, Securock Brand Glass-Mat Sheathing and Sheetrock Brand All Purpose Joint Compound.

In December 2013, Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway became the largest shareholder in the company (holding roughly 30%) when it converted USG convertible notes it had acquired in 2008 to common stock.

In June 2018, USG entered into an agreement to be purchased by the privately-held building materials company Knauf. It operates as an independent subsidiary of Knauf and continues to remain headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The deal closed in April 2019.

==History==
In 1890, New York Coal Tar Chemical Company employees Fred L. Kane and Augustine Sackett developed plaster board by, first, strengthening the plaster with Plaster of Paris sandwiched between heavy paper, creating a viable competitor to traditional lime plaster. Sackett patented the new drywall product as Sackett Board in 1894.

Since gypsum was plentiful, available at a relatively low price, and used a simple manufacturing process, new firms flooded and fragmented the market, placing constant downward pressure on prices.

On December 27, 1901, 30 gypsum and plaster companies merged to form the United States Gypsum Company (USG), resulting in the creation of the first nationwide gypsum company in the United States. The new company combined the operations of 37 mining and calcining plants producing agricultural and construction plaster. Directors of the new firm selected B.W. McCausland of Michigan for its first president; in 1905, he was succeeded by his previous Alabaster Company business partner&#x27;s son, Sewell Avery, who served in the role for 35 years.

In 1909, Avery led the USG acquisition of the Sackett Plaster Board Company, inventor of Sackett Board, which was a panel made of multiple layers of plaster and paper. Patented by USG in 1912, a new manufacturing process produced boards with a single layer of plaster and paper that could be joined flush along a wall with a relatively smooth surface. Originally called Adamant Plaster Board, the product became known as Sheetrock in 1917, with the new term credited to USG sales representative D.L. Hunter of Fort Dodge, Iowa.

By the 1930s, the company&#x27;s policy of diffusion of manufacturing facilities, vertical integration and product diversification allowed it to operate profitably every year during the Great Depression. The 1933 Chicago World‚Äôs Fair featured buildings made almost entirely out of sheetrock panels, which led to the brand&#x27;s first major advertising campaign.

The 1950s and 1960s saw expansion into Mexico and other international markets.

Recession and its effect on the bottom line dominated the 1980s and led to a restructuring of the company. On January 1, 1985, USG Corporation was formed as a holding company a reverse merger in which United States Gypsum Company became one of just nine operating subsidiaries.

In the mid- to late-1990s, the company invested in a significant expansion of its manufacturing network, adding new high-speed wallboard manufacturing operations in Rainier, OR, Bridgeport, AL, and Aliquippa, PA. Other existing operations were substantially rebuilt or modernized, including the wallboard manufacturing plant in East Chicago, Indiana.

In 1999, USG acquired Sybex, Inc. the holding company for Beadex (a competing joint compound manufacturer) and Synkoloid. Other USG subsidiaries at the time included Alabaster Assurance Company, CGC, Donn Products, Exploracion de Yeso, Grupo Yeso, Gypsum Engineering, H &amp; B Gypsum, L&amp;W Supply, La Mirada Products Co., Inc, Red Top Technology, and Yeso Panamericano.

In 2001, the company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to resolve legacy asbestos lawsuits. Asbestos was a minor ingredient in some specialty products that the company had stopped selling almost 40 years earlier, in the 1970s. The company&#x27;s operations remained healthy and profitable while it was in Chapter 11. When the bankruptcy was completed in 2006, all creditors were repaid in full and USG shareholders retained equity in the company. In a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article dated February 15, 2006, Warren Buffett said, &quot;It&#x27;s the most successful managerial performance in bankruptcy that I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; A $3.95 billion trust was created to handle all existing and potential future asbestos lawsuits, thus permanently resolving the asbestos litigation issue.

USG adapted during the Great Recession, which hit the residential and commercial construction markets in mid-2006, resulting in a decreased demand for drywall. USG cut costs by closing some of its operations, including the shuttering of its Empire, Nevada facility in 2011.

William C. Foote, the company&#x27;s CEO for almost 20 years, retired in 2010, and 30-year USG veteran James S. Metcalf was elected Chairman, President and CEO. Metcalf implemented the company&#x27;s &quot;Plan to Win&quot; which involved strengthening its core manufacturing operations and L&amp;W Supply distribution business, diversifying sources of revenues and profitability, and differentiating the company from competitors through innovative products and services. The company returned to profitability in the first quarter of 2013, posting net earnings of $2 million, followed by $26 million in net income in the second quarter of 2013.

In 2020, the 2011 closure of its Empire, Nevada operation was referenced in the movie &quot;Nomadland&quot;.

==Corporate structure==
USG Corporation has the following significant subsidiaries:

* United States Gypsum Company
:* USG Interiors, LLC
:* Otsego Paper, Inc
* USG Foreign Investments, Ltd
:* CGC Inc.
:* USG Latin America, LLC
::* USG Holding de Mexico S.A. de C.V.
:::* USG Mexico S.A. de C.V.

===Corporate headquarters building===
In 1992, USG moved its corporate headquarters from 101 South Wacker Drive to 125 S. Franklin Street in Chicago, a site which it occupied until March 2007. Known as the USG building, the structure is part of the dual-tower AT&amp;T Corporate Center, which was completed in 1989. The building was designed by Adrian D. Smith, FAIA, RIBA Design Partner at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and constructed by Morse Diesel within its $110 million construction budget. The USG building is tall and houses 35 floors and of space, including of retail, a 650-seat restaurant expansion, and two levels of below-grade parking for 160 cars. USG had its own entrance with a lobby and occupied the first nine floors exclusively and parts of the 11th floor. Italian marble is used as cladding and also in the highly ornate interior. The interior also features gold leaf and satin-finish brown and American oak wood trim. Parts of the building lobbies were used in the filming of the 1994 film, &quot;Ri¬¢hie Ri¬¢h&quot;.

In 2005, USG announced it would not be renewing its lease at the 125 S. Franklin Street building and instead would move to a new building at 550 W. Adams developed by Fifield Companies. The base building architect is De Stefano + Partners, with The Environments Group providing the interior space design and construction. USG entered a 15-year lease, and occupied the building in early 2007. The new building is occupied 65% by USG and 10% by Humana Inc. As an incentive for USG to remain in the downtown Chicago area, the city of Chicago created a redevelopment agreement that contributed $6.5 million to the construction of the new building. In turn, USG agreed to maintain at least 500 full-time equivalent jobs at all times for a period of ten years at the new corporate headquarters.

===Manufacturing and mining facilities===
Gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities are reported to the SEC based on the extent to which the gypsum they use comes from synthetic or natural sources.

===Plaster City, California facility===
USG has a large gypsum plant located west of El Centro, California, along highway Interstate 8, at Plaster City. The Plaster City location makes Sheetrock brand gypsum panels. The gypsum is mined from a quarry located to the north, in the Fish Creek Mountains of Imperial County. The quarry is estimated to contain a deposit of 25 million tons of gypsum.

USG operates an active narrow gauge railway, the last industrial narrow gauge railway in the United States. The gauge line runs north for from the plant at Plaster City (formerly known as &quot;Maria&quot;) to the gypsum quarry. The line hauls gypsum rock from the quarry to the plant.
The line was originally built by the Imperial Gypsum Company Railroad and was owned by the Imperial Valley Gypsum and Oil Corporation. The railroad built from the San Diego &amp; Arizona Railway at Plaster City to the quarry. Surveying commenced in April 1921, grading on October 3, 1921 and construction was completed on September 15, 1922. Commercial operation commenced on October 14, 1922. The total length of the line was . Two years after completion of the line (1924), the track was sold to the Pacific Portland Cement Company.

USG purchased the line from the Pacific Portland Cement Company in 1946. In 1947, the first diesel engine was operated on the line.

The USG plant at Plaster City is currently served by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP).

==Significant events==
===Antitrust cases===
;Criminal

In 1973, six wallboard manufacturers (including USG) were charged with violating ¬ß1 of the Sherman Act during the period 19601973, through engaging in a combination and conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of gypsum board. In July 1975, after the jury was committed to deliberate, it became apparent that the jury was heading for a deadlock. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, but the trial judge denied the request, although he indicated that, if no verdict were rendered by the end of the week, he would then reconsider the mistrial motions. The following morning, the jury returned guilty verdicts against each of the defendants.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the convictions, and that ruling was subsequently affirmed by the United States Supreme Court on the grounds that:

#The trial judge&#x27;s instruction to the jury was improper, as it emphasized a presumption of wrongful intent, rather than concentrating on verifying the defendant&#x27;s state of mind through evidence and inferences drawn therefrom. In that regard, the &quot;Sherman Act&quot; does not create a regime of strict liability.
#A good faith belief, rather than an absolute certainty, that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the defense available under ¬ß 2(b) of the &quot;Clayton Act&quot;.
#The &quot;ex parte&quot; meeting between the trial judge and the jury foreman was improper, and the Court of Appeals would have been justified in reversing the convictions solely because of the risk that the foreman believed the judge was insisting on a dispositive verdict.
#The trial judge&#x27;s charge concerning participation in the conspiracy, although perhaps not completely clear, was sufficient, but his charge on withdrawal from the conspiracy was erroneous.

;Civil

In 1940, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit against USG and six other wallboard manufacturers, charging them with price fixing under ¬ß¬ß 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The claim stemmed from US Gypsum&#x27;s 1929 cross-licensing agreements for its patented wallboard, which set prices at which the wallboard must be sold. In 1950 the Supreme Court forced US Gypsum and its six licensees who produced all of the wallboard sold east of the Rocky Mountains to cease setting prices, and US Gypsum was enjoined from exercising its patent-licensing privilege.

During 19691974 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, a series of civil antitrust cases were heard that came to be known as &quot;In re Gypsum Antitrust Cases&quot;. As a result, USG (together with National Gypsum Company and Kaiser Gypsum Company) were found to have violated ¬ß 1 of the Sherman Act for conspiring to establish and maintain prices of gypsum wallboard.

In December 2012, USG (together with National Gypsum, Lafarge North America and Georgia-Pacific), was accused in a class action for allegedly violating federal antitrust laws, through raising prices on drywall products by as much as 35 percent, as well as halting a longstanding practice of letting customers lock in prices for the duration of a construction project. USG stated that it did not participate, or engage in, any unlawful conduct.

===Hostile takeover attempts===
In November 1986 the Belzberg brothers of Canada attempted a hostile takeover of USG. USG immediately instituted a plan to buy back 20 percent of its common stock in an effort to fend off the takeover. By December 1986, however, USG had purchased Samuel, William, and Hyman Belzberg&#x27;s 4.9 percent stake, for $139.6 million.

In October 1987, Texas oilman Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown, through Desert Partners, LP, attempted a hostile takeover of USG, buying 9.84% of USG&#x27;s outstanding stock. USG decided to fight this attempt by offering $42 per share ($37 in cash and $5 in pay in kind debenture) plus a stub stock worth $7. Desert Partners was unable to match the offer and lost the proxy fight at a shareholder&#x27;s meeting. To pay for the offer, USG took a poison pill by borrowing $1.6 billion from 135 banks, and issuing $600 million in 13.25% subordinated debentures due in 2000 and $260 million in 16% pay-in-kind debentures due in 2008. To help pay for all the new debt, USG sold off:

:* subsidiaries Castlegate, A. P. Green, Masonite, DAP, and Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.
:* its construction metals plants, a paper-bag plant, and a lime plant
:* its headquarters building at 101 South Wacker Drive in Chicago and its corporate jets,

and instituted large workforce reductions.

The sell-off and workforce reduction of 7% were not enough to allow USG to service the debt payments ($800,000 per day) in the economic downturn. The poison pill was too much for the corporation to survive.

===Bankruptcy===
On March 17, 1993, USG filed a pre-packaged bankruptcy petition that included a 50-to-1 reverse stock split. USG&#x27;s stock dipped to 28 cents per share and the corporation emerged from bankruptcy 38 days later on May 6, 1993. The corporation&#x27;s debt was reduced by $1.4 billion and interest costs dropped from $320 million per year to $170 million per year. The plan worked and USG re-emerged to be a profitable corporation.

USG once again declared bankruptcy on June 25, 2001, under Chapter 11 to manage the growing asbestos litigation costs. USG was the eighth company in an 18-month period that was forced to utilize Chapter 11 to resolve asbestos claims. In the prior two decades, 27 companies filed for protection under Chapter 11 because of asbestos litigation. Since 1994, U.S. Gypsum was named in more than 250,000 asbestos-related personal injury claims, and paid more than $450 million (before insurance) to manage and resolve asbestos-related litigation. USG received more than 22,000 new claims since the beginning of 2001. USG&#x27;s asbestos personal injury costs (before insurance) rose from $30 million in 1997 to more than $160 million in 2000, and were expected to exceed $275 million in 2001.

On February 17, 2006, USG announced a Joint Plan of Reorganization to emerge from bankruptcy. Under the agreement, USG would create a trust to pay asbestos personal injury claims. USG&#x27;s bank lenders, bondholders and trade suppliers would be paid in full with interest. Stockholders would retain ownership of the company. To pay for the trust USG would use cash it had accumulated during the bankruptcy, new long-term debt, a tax rebate from the federal government, and an innovative rights offering. Existing USG stock owners would be issued rights to buy new USG stock at a set price of $40 per share. These rights could be exercised or sold. The $1.8 billion rights offering would be backstopped by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., meaning Berkshire Hathaway would buy all the new shares not bought. For the service, USG would pay Berkshire Hathaway a $67 million non-refundable fee.

On June 20, 2006, USG announced their Joint Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by two judges for the United States Bankruptcy Court and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, allowing the company to complete the bankruptcy case and emerge from bankruptcy. USG announced a $900 million payment to the new trust was made that day and two subsequent payments totaling $3.05 billion would be made within the next 12 months if Congress failed to enact legislation establishing a national asbestos personal injury trust fund, such as the FAIR Act.

<text>Shaved Fish is a compilation album by English rock musician John Lennon with the Plastic Ono Band, issued in October 1975 on Apple Records. It contains all of the singles that he had issued up to that point in the United States as a solo artist, with the exception of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which had been released earlier that year. The only compilation of Lennon&#x27;s non-Beatles recordings released during his lifetime, the album peaked at number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. It was also Lennon&#x27;s final album released on Apple Records before it was shut down in 1975, to be revived in the 1990s.

==Background==
After the release of his album of oldies cover versions, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1975), Lennon was planning to work on an album of new material. However, when his wife Yoko Ono became pregnant, he decided to reissue songs from his solo career.

==Content==
&quot;Shaved Fish&quot; includes many of Lennon&#x27;s most popular solo recordings in their original 45 rpm single edits. Five of the songs had not been previously issued on an album: &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, &quot;Power to the People&quot;, the holiday single &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. The latter appears in truncated form and opens side one, while an excerpt of a live version of the song closes side two. Eight of these singles made the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, with &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; going to number 1; five made the top ten in the United Kingdom. &quot;Imagine&quot;, never previously released as a single in the UK, was issued as such concurrent to the release of this album.

==Artwork and packaging==
Roy Kohara was the art director of the album, and the illustrations were made by Michael Bryan. The cover is divided into twelve rectangles: one for each of the eleven songs on the LP, and one for the album title, written in &quot;Bruce Mikita&quot; font (also known as &quot;Novel Open&quot;).

The album title originates from the Japanese food katsuobushi, a kind of dried fish.

==Release==
&quot;Shaved Fish&quot; was released on 20 October 1975 in the US and 24 October in the UK. The release of the album came less than three weeks after the resolution of Lennon&#x27;s long-running immigration dispute and the birth of Sean Lennon.

Several of the master tapes were unavailable for the compilation, and dubs from 45 rpm single records were used. Due to this, the first release of the compact disc in May 1987 suffered from poor sound quality and needed to be remastered. The improved CD version was issued in December 1987, restoring the full fadeouts that were shortened in some of the songs on the original release.

In February 1976, following the release of the album, Lennon&#x27;s recording contract expired, and he was uninterested in re-signing with EMI/Capitol.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the album &quot;eleven shots in the dark from the weirdest major rock and roller of the early &#x27;70s&quot; and said &quot;not counting the two available on must-own albums, the only great cuts are &#x27;Instant Karma&#x27; (Lennon&#x27;s best political song) and &#x27;#9 Dream.&#x27;&quot; Dave Marsh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the inclusion of non-album songs like &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, calling it &quot;Lennon&#x27;s best solo track&quot;, but deemed the compilation &quot;so diffuse that it probably does present an accurate overview of Lennon&#x27;s confused career since leaving the Beatles.&quot; He concluded that the album was evidence &quot;not only of John Lennon&#x27;s genius but of his continuing career difficulty.&quot; Charles Shaar Murray of the &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Shaved Fish&quot; &quot;as nifty a Greatest Hits album as you could expect from anybody who hasn&#x27;t already put one out&quot; and deemed the performances &quot;stunning throughout&quot;. However, he felt the track selection was &quot;a little off whack&quot;, particularly the inclusion of &quot;Mother&quot;, which he found to be &quot;such an integral part of the initial &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; album that I feel it&#x27;s manifestly unfair to both artist and public to include it on an album of this nature.&quot;

A &quot;Creem&quot; magazine reader&#x27;s poll in 1975 included the album among the top five &quot;Best Reissues&quot; of 1975, placing fourth, behind two Rolling Stones compilations, &quot;Made in the Shade&quot; and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;.

===Commercial===
The album was released in the UK on 24 October 1975, peaking at number 8. Released from the album on the same day in the UK was the single &quot;Imagine&quot;, backed with &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, charting at number 6. The single was also Lennon&#x27;s last for Apple Records. 

The album later re-charted in the UK on 17 January 1981, at number 11.

<text>V√©ronique Tadjo (born 1955) is a writer, poet, novelist, and artist from C√¥te d&#x27;Ivoire. Having lived and worked in many countries within the African continent and diaspora, she feels herself to be pan-African, in a way that is reflected in the subject matter, imagery and allusions of her work.
==Biography==
=== Early years and education ===
Born in Paris, France, V√©ronique Tadjo is the daughter of an Ivorian civil servant and a French painter and sculptor. Brought up in Abidjan, C√¥te d&#x27;Ivoire, she travelled widely with her family.

Tadjo completed her BA degree at the University of Abidjan and her doctorate at the Sorbonne in African-American Literature and Civilization. In 1983, she went to Howard University in Washington, D.C., on a Fulbright research scholarship.

=== Career ===
In 1979, Tadjo chose to teach English at the Lyc√©e Moderne de Korhogo (secondary school) in the North of C√¥te d&#x27;Ivoire. She subsequently became a lecturer in the English department at the University of Abidjan until 1993.

In 1984, she published her first book of poetry, &quot;Lat√©rite / Red Earth&quot;, winning a literary prize from the Agence de Coop√©ration Culturelle et Technique. Writing by Tadjo was included in the 1992 anthology &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby.

In 1998, she participated in the project &quot;Rwanda: Ecrire par devoir de m√©moire&quot; (Rwanda: Writing for the sake of memory) with a group of African writers who travelled to Rwanda to testify to the Rwandan genocide and its aftermath. Her book &quot;L&#x27;Ombre d&#x27;Imana&quot; (2000) emerged from her time in Rwanda.

In the past few years, she has facilitated workshops in writing and illustrating children&#x27;s books in Mali, Benin, Chad, Haiti, Mauritius, French Guiana, Burundi, Rwanda, the United States, and South Africa. In 2006 she participated in the fall residency of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa.

Tadjo has lived in Paris, Lagos, Mexico City, Nairobi and London. She was based in Johannesburg after 2007 as head of French Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand.

==Awards and Honours==
Tadjo received the Literary Prize of L&#x27;Agence de Coop√©ration Culturelle et Technique in 1983 and the UNICEF Prize in 1993 for &quot;Mamy Wata and the Monster&quot;, which was also chosen as one of Africa&#x27;s 100 Best Books of the 20th Century, one of only four children&#x27;s books selected.

In 2005, Tadjo won the Grand prix litt√©raire d&#x27;Afrique noire and in 2016 the Bernard Dadi√© national grand prize for literature. Her 2021 book &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; won the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Fiction.

In a June 2024 graduation ceremony at the University of St Andrews, Tadjo was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt).

<text>The Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA) is a research institute located in Garching, just north of Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It is one of many scientific research institutes belonging to the Max Planck Society.

The MPA is widely considered to be one of the leading institutions in the world for theoretical astrophysics research. According to Thomson Reuters, from 1999-2009 the Max Planck Society as a whole published more papers and accumulated more citations in the fields of physics and space science than any other research organization in the world.

==History==
The Max Planck Society was founded on 26 February 1948. It effectively replaced the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science, which was dissolved after World War II. The society is named after Max Planck, one of the founders of quantum theory.

The MPA was founded as the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in 1958 and split into the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the Max Planck Institute for Physics in 1991. In 1995, the numerical relativity group moved to the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics.

The MPA is one of several Max Planck Institutes that specialize in astronomy and astrophysics. Others are the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching (located next-door to the MPA), the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G√∂ttingen, and the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (a.k.a. Albert Einstein Institute) in Golm.

The institute is located next-door to the MPI for Extraterrestrial Physics, as well as the headquarters of the European Southern Observatory. It also enjoys close working relationships with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University Munich.

At any given time, the institute employs approximately 50 scientists, instructs over 30 PhD students, and hosts about 20 visiting scientists (some 60 visitors stay for longer than 2 weeks in any given year).

As of 2021, the four directors of the MPA are Selma de Mink, Guinevere Kauffmann, Eiichiro Komatsu, and Volker Springel.

Previous directors include Ludwig Biermann (1958 ‚Äì 75), Rudolf Kippenhahn (1975 ‚Äì 91), Simon White (1994 ‚Äì 2019), Rashid Sunyaev (1995 ‚Äì 2018), Wolfgang Hillebrandt (1997 ‚Äì 2009) and Martin Asplund (2007 ‚Äì 2011).

==Science==
Focusing on theoretical investigations, the MPA covers a wide range of topics in astrophysics. These include:
* Cosmology, in particular galaxy formation and evolution, reionization, and the cosmic microwave background;
* High-energy astronomy and astrophysics, including supermassive black holes, galaxy clusters, active galactic nuclei and quasars, X-ray binaries, and accretion discs;
* Stellar physics, including stellar evolution and stellar explosions such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.

==Public outreach==
The MPA works to explain astrophysical concepts and disseminate its findings to the public. These activities include popular science articles written by MPA scientists, events hosting school groups, events open to the general public, and monthly research highlights written for a general audience.

==Graduate program==
The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astrophysics is a graduate program offering a PhD in astrophysics. The school is a cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Technical University Munich.

<text>Walls and Bridges is the fourth solo studio album by English musician John Lennon. It was issued by Apple Records on 26 September 1974 in the United States and on 4 October in the United Kingdom. Written, recorded and released during his 18-month separation from Yoko Ono, the album captured Lennon in the midst of his &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;. &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was an American number-one album on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; charts and included two hit singles, &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; and &quot;#9 Dream&quot;. The first of these was Lennon&#x27;s first number-one hit in the United States as a solo artist, and his only solo chart-topping single in either the US or Britain during his lifetime.

The album was certified silver in the UK, and gold in the US.

==Background==
In June 1973, as Lennon was about to record &quot;Mind Games&quot;, Ono suggested that she and Lennon should separate. Lennon soon moved to California with his and Ono&#x27;s personal assistant May Pang with Ono&#x27;s encouragement and they embarked on an 18-month relationship he would later refer to as his &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;. While he and Pang were living in Los Angeles, Lennon took the opportunity to get reacquainted with his son Julian, whom he had not seen in two years.

Lennon had planned to record an album of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll oldies with producer Phil Spector, but these sessions became legendary not for the music produced but for alcohol-fuelled antics. Lennon and Pang returned to New York and Spector disappeared with these session tapes. Around this time, Lennon had written several new songs during a stay at The Pierre and started recording a few home demos.

==Recording==
Lennon began rehearsing his new material with studio musicians at Record Plant East in New York City in June 1974 which included Jim Keltner on drums, Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Jesse Ed Davis on guitar and Arthur Jenkins on percussion. The core players were billed on the album as the Plastic Ono Nuclear Band, a variation on Plastic Ono Band, the conceptual group to which many of Lennon&#x27;s solo efforts were credited.

The musicians worked out their own arrangements in a short time, and the recording advanced quickly. Ron Aprea, the saxophonist from the Little Big Horns, said that &quot;Since he had no formal training in arranging, he would sit in the control room and let us make up our own parts. If he liked what we played, he would let us know¬†... If we thought we could get it better, he would say &#x27;go for it&#x27;.&quot; Aprea also said that the brass section was recorded over a two-week period. Lennon later said that it had been &quot;an extraordinary year for me personally. And I&#x27;m almost amazed that I could get anything out. But I enjoyed doing &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; and it wasn&#x27;t hard when I had the whole thing to go into the studio and do it. I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t just all &quot;bluuuuuuggggghhhhh&quot;.&quot; Rehearsals were released on the posthumous albums &quot;Menlove Ave.&quot; and &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;.

Engineer Jimmy Iovine said that the sessions were &quot;&quot;the&quot; most professional I have still been on¬†... John knew what he wanted, he knew how to get what he was going for, he was going after a noise and he knew how to get it¬†... His solo thing had an incredible sound to it. And he really had his own sound.&quot; Despite Record Plant being one of the most state-of-the-art recording studios in New York at that point, Lennon&#x27;s vocal overdubs were done with an old stage microphone, which had been left in a bass drum for years. Iovine said that &quot;(it) was an old beat up one¬†... so it was dull in a way, but John&#x27;s voice was so bright, that it sounded incredible on it. It turned out to be great vocal sound, like on &#x27;#9 Dream&#x27;.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; has a variety of musical stylings and many of the lyrics make it clear that Lennon both enjoyed his new-found freedom and also missed Ono. The album title refers to the barriers that Lennon had constructed between himself and others and his hope that those barriers could be surmounted. Lennon said, &quot;Walls keep you in either protectively or otherwise, and bridges get you somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Going Down on Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, incorporates a sexual pun and the lyrics reflect Lennon&#x27;s feelings about his separation from Ono. The second track, &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s first single. The inspiration for the lyrics came from late-night television. In December 2005, May Pang told &quot;Radio Times&quot;: &quot;At night he loved to channel-surf, and would pick up phrases from all the shows. One time, he was watching Reverend Ike, a famous black evangelist, who was saying, &quot;Let me tell you guys, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it&#x27;s whatever gets you through the night.&quot; John loved it and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to write it down or I&#x27;ll forget it.&quot; He always kept a pad and pen by the bed. That was the beginning of &#x27;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night&#x27;.&quot; The music was inspired by the number one single at the time, &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; by George McCrae. Although the released track bears little resemblance, the inspiration is more apparent on the alternative version released on &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;. The third track is the Lennon/Harry Nilsson composition &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot; which features Nilsson on harmony vocal.

The next two tracks, &quot;What You Got&quot; and &quot;Bless You&quot;, are again songs addressing his feelings about his separation from Ono. Lennon later called the jazzy &quot;Bless You&quot; the &quot;best piece of work on the album¬†... that seems to be the best track, to me.&quot; Side one closes with &quot;Scared,&quot; a haunting track which explores Lennon&#x27;s fear of ageing, loneliness and the emptiness of success.

Side two leads off with the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;#9 Dream&quot;, which features May Pang on background vocals. According to Pang, two working titles for the song were &quot;So Long Ago&quot; and &quot;Walls &amp; Bridges&quot;. The song was notable as a favourite of Lennon&#x27;s, despite his later claim that the song was a &quot;throwaway&quot;. Pang recalled, &quot;This was one of John&#x27;s favorite songs, because it literally came to him in a dream. He woke up and wrote down those words along with the melody. He had no idea what [Ah, Bowakawa pousse] meant, but he thought it sounded beautiful.&quot; The next track is a song Lennon wrote for Pang, &quot;Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)&quot; which features Elton John on harmony vocal. &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; includes a sinister riff reminiscent of &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, Lennon&#x27;s audio argument with Paul McCartney from the &quot;Imagine&quot; album, although the digs this time were thought to be directed at the former Beatles manager Allen Klein. &quot;Beef Jerky&quot;, a rare Lennon instrumental, is a funky, R&amp;B-inspired track. In a nod to his old partner, it also contains a riff that replicates one from Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Roll It,&quot; which was a song McCartney wrote in a &quot;Lennon style.&quot; 

The penultimate track, &quot;Nobody Loves You (When You&#x27;re Down and Out)&quot;, was written in 1973 when he and Pang first arrived in Los Angeles. He envisioned Frank Sinatra recording it, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s kind of a Sinatraesque song, really. He would do a perfect job with it. Are you listening Frank? You need one song that isn&#x27;t a piece of nothing. Here&#x27;s one for you, the horn arrangement and everything&#x27;s made for you. But don&#x27;t ask me to produce it!&quot;

The final track is a cover version of Lee Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Ya Ya&quot;, with Lennon (billed as &quot;Dad&quot;) on piano and vocals and son Julian on drums. Lennon surprised Julian with its inclusion on the album, prompting the young Lennon to remark, &quot;If I&#x27;d known it was going on the album, I would have played better!&quot;

When discussing the recording of the album, in an interview the following year with Pete Hamill in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lennon recalled, &quot;Elton sort of popped in on the sessions for &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; and sort of zapped in and played the piano and ended up singing &#x27;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night&#x27; with me. Which was a great shot in the arm. I&#x27;d done three quarters of it, &#x27;Now what do we do?&#x27; Should we put a camel on it or a xylophone? That sort of thing. And he came in and said, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;ll play some piano!&#x27;&quot;

== Album artwork ==
Originally, Lennon planned to use some of his childhood drawings for the cover of an oldies album he had begun in 1973, but when he put that on hold to record &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;, he decided to use the artwork already in production. The album&#x27;s elaborate outer jacket featured some of his drawings, including one portraying a game of football, specifically the goal scored by George Robledo in the 1952 FA Cup Final. That drawing also featured Newcastle United&#x27;s number 9 Jackie Milburn; Lennon lived as a child at 9 Newcastle Road and had a lifelong fascination with the number. There is also a series of photos of Lennon&#x27;s face with different expressions. The front cover contained two flaps which, when folded, created several interchangeable &quot;Lennon faces&quot;, some of them silly.

The album&#x27;s art direction was credited to Capitol&#x27;s in-house designer, Roy Kohara. The booklet inside the LP included a front photo of Lennon with no glasses and a back photo of Lennon with five pairs of glasses piled on top of one another, both by the American photographer Bob Gruen. The inner sleeve contained another portrait as well as a horizontal melange of the other photos.

Inside the booklet were lyrics and instrumental credits for the songs, which conveyed Lennon&#x27;s trademark sense of humour, with many aliases for himself including Rev. Thumbs Ghurkin, Kaptain Kundalini, Dwarf McDougal, Mel Torment (a pun on Mel Torm√©), Hon. John St. John Johnson, Dr. Dream, Dr. Winston O&#x27;Boogie and Dad. More 1952 colour drawings from the 11-year-old Lennon were included, with subjects including the American Old West (dedicated to his aunt and guardian, Mimi Smith), landscapes and a portrait of his schoolteacher, Mr. Bolt. Also included was a genealogical treatise on the surname Lennon and related forms from one of Edward MacLysaght&#x27;s books. While mentioning the British sailor John Lennon and the American labour leader John Brown Lennon of many decades past, the entry ends with a slight about the surname family generally being undistinguished, to which Lennon offered a hand-written &quot;Oh Yeh?&quot;. Finally, the booklet contains a claim that Lennon saw an unidentified flying object on the evening of 23 August 1974.

==Release and promotion==
Unsure of which track should be the album&#x27;s lead single, Lennon enlisted the help of Al Coury, the vice-president of marketing for Capitol Records. Lennon had been impressed with the &quot;magic&quot; that Coury displayed in the commercial success of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Band on the Run&quot; album. Coury chose &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; as the first single. &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was released on 26 September 1974 in the US, and on 4 October 1974 in the UK. The release was accompanied by an advertising campaign, created by Lennon, called &quot;Listen To This¬†...&quot; (button, photo, sticker, ad, poster or T-shirt). The backs of 500 New York City buses were plastered with the slogan &quot;Listen To This Bus&quot;. Television commercials depicted the LP jacket with its many &quot;Lennon&quot; faces; as with the radio segments promoting the album, these commercials had a voiceover from Ringo Starr. Lennon returned the favour by supplying the voiceover in commercials for Starr&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; album, which he had also helped record. In the UK, EMI released an interview single to promote &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;, with Lennon in conversation with Bob Mercer.

In the U.S., the album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart on 12 October and reached the top ten on 2 November. It was awarded gold record status on 22 October in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album and the single topped &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s listings during the same week (16 November). Both releases also topped the US charts compiled by &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;. In the UK, the album reached number 6, and the single peaked at number 36. &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; spent a total of 27 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s Top LPs &amp; Tape chart.

&quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s first number 1 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a solo artist. This achievement, together with the US success of the album, marked a comeback for Lennon, whose career since &quot;Imagine&quot; in 1971 had trailed that of his former Beatles bandmates in terms of commercial success. When asked for his opinion of &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; during the press conference for his 1974 North American tour, George Harrison described it as a &quot;lovely&quot; album. Ringo Starr said he admired all of Lennon&#x27;s work, apart from &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, and he lauded &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; as &quot;the finest album in the last five years by anybody&quot;. McCartney said it was a &quot;great&quot; record but added: &quot;I know he can do better.&quot; McCartney cited the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; as an example of how Lennon could be &quot;more adventurous ‚Ä¶ more exciting&quot;.

Shortly after its release, Lennon personally mixed a four channel quadraphonic version of &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; (&quot;for the 20 people who buy quad&quot;, he joked in his 1974 WNEW-FM radio interview in New York). The quadraphonic mix was issued only on 8-track tape in the US. &quot;#9 Dream&quot;, backed with &quot;What You Got&quot;, was released as a single in the US on 16 December 1974, and a month later in the UK, on 24 January 1975. The single peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 23 in the UK.

During the recording of &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot;, Elton John had bet Lennon that the song would top the charts. Never believing it would, Lennon agreed to perform live with John if it did. Having lost the wager, Lennon appeared at John&#x27;s Madison Square Garden show on 28 November, performing &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot; together with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;. All three tracks were later released on an EP, &quot;28th November 1974&quot;, in 1981. Lennon returned to the stage to play tambourine on the encore, John&#x27;s &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;. The Madison Square Garden show would be Lennon&#x27;s last major live performance.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; received a mixed response from contemporary music critics, although it still garnered Lennon his most favourable reviews since &quot;Imagine&quot;. Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said he felt that songs on side two such as &quot;#9 Dream&quot; and &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; make the album &quot;diverse and spirited&quot;, but that side one&#x27;s songs about Lennon&#x27;s emotional loss were inconsistent. Gerson also said that only &quot;Scared&quot; &quot;throbs with the primal fear and sense of confinement of his earlier solo LPs&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, felt the album suffered from Lennon&#x27;s &quot;disorientation and lost conviction&quot;. In his review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ray Coleman described Lennon as &quot;the most interesting ex-Beatle&quot; and concluded of &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;: &quot;This is a truly superb album by any standards, words and music a joy to hear, by a musician who has a rare talent for selling love without making you cringe.&quot; In another positive review, &quot;Billboard&quot; found the album&#x27;s production &quot;superb&quot;, its ballads &quot;marvelously handled&quot;, and all songs &quot;done in a skillfully professional style&quot;. The magazine cited it as possibly Lennon&#x27;s &quot;most versatile and musically excellent album yet&quot;.

Writing for the &quot;NME&quot;, Charles Shaar Murray described the musicianship as &quot;faultless, if a trifle pedestrian&quot; and the production &quot;as smooth and silky as any discerning hi-fi buff could want&quot;, but considered the songs to be &quot;mostly a drag, and worse, most of them are solidly rooted in the Lennonlore of old&quot;. While deriding &quot;Nobody Loves You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot; as &quot;the rankest and most offensive piece of self-pity that Lennon has yet indulged in&quot;, Shaar Murray concluded of the album: &quot;None of this mediocre waste is worthy of the man who wrote &#x27;Working Class Hero&#x27; and &#x27;I Found Out&#x27;.&quot; In another unfavourable review, for &quot;Creem&quot;, Wayne Robins described &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; as &quot;the latest chapter in John Lennon&#x27;s Identity Crisis&quot; and a work made up of &quot;weary cliches&quot;. Of the two tracks that he deemed &quot;good&quot;, Robins added: &quot;&#x27;Old Dirt Road&#x27; shows the brilliant instinct for phrasing and rhythm of language that a guy named John Lennon used to have before he started hiding behind walls of aliases like Dr. Winston O&#x27;Boogie, and sleeping under bridges played by that Plastic Ono Sominex Band. ZZzzzzz.&quot;

In their 1975 book &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot; journalists Roy Carr and Tony Tyler characterised the album as &quot;generally lacklustre&quot;, saying that the lyrics &quot;seem mechanical, cranked-out, like well-worn conversational gambits&quot;, while praising the &quot;abrasive&quot; quality of his voice and the &quot;excellent&quot; musicianship. In his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; feature on Lennon that same year, Pete Hamill wrote that the album&#x27;s music was &quot;wonderful&quot; and that &quot;the songs were essays in autobiography, the words and music of a man trying to understand a huge part of his life.&quot; In his 1977 book &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot;, Nicholas Schaffner said that the album&#x27;s &quot;searing emotional intensity&quot; recalled Lennon&#x27;s 1970 &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;, while the &quot;richly textured arrangements and melodic diversity&quot; harkened back to &quot;Imagine&quot;. In the first edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; (1979), Greil Marcus gave the album two stars out of five, saying that it, along with &quot;Mind Games&quot;, lacked a real point of view and that &quot;with what appeared to be panic, [Lennon had] substituted production techniques for soul, building a bridge to his listeners with his sound but erecting a wall around himself with empty music.&quot;

===Legacy===
Writing in &quot;The All-Music Guide to Rock&quot; (1995), William Ruhlmann described &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; as &quot;craftsmanlike pop-rock&quot; with &quot;some lovely album tracks&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; gave it four stars and asserted that &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Night&quot; &quot;remains one of Lennon&#x27;s best post-Beatles achievements&quot;. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine finds the album &quot;decidedly uneven&quot;, &quot;containing equal amounts of brilliance and nonsense&quot;, with the lesser tracks &quot;weighed down by weak melodies and heavy over-production&quot;. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; of 2004, &quot;#9 Dream&quot; was singled out for praise as &quot;a heavily atmospheric number boasting cool cellos and fine singing&quot;. Lennon biographer Philip Norman wrote in 2008 that &quot;Most of the tracks had an upbeat, brassy feel, strangely at odds with John&#x27;s recurrent, often desperate admissions of longing for Yoko&quot;, and that the chord sequences used often echoed those from his previous work with Ono. In 2022, Listverse described Lennon&#x27;s process as necessary, before proclaiming it the &quot;last of the essential&quot; Lennon albums.

==Aftermath and reissues==
&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s last album of original material until 1980&#x27;s &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;, although a follow-up, titled &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, was planned for late 1975. Tony King, an Apple vice-president, confirms this. King also says that Carlos Alomar was to hire a group of black musicians, and that Lennon had written the song &quot;Tennessee&quot; for the album. In a 1975 interview for the &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, Lennon indicated he was planning a new album and a TV special.

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was first re-released on vinyl in the US in 1978, then again in 1982, and 1989, on Capitol. After Lennon&#x27;s death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. It was re-released on vinyl in the UK in 1985, on the Parlophone label. &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was first released on CD on 20 July 1987 in the UK, and nearly a year later in the US, on 19 April 1988. The album was released again on vinyl, this time as part of EMI&#x27;s limited edition &quot;The Millennium Vinyl Collection&quot; series, in 1999.

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was released in a remixed and remastered form in November 2005 (although four of the original tracks ‚Äì &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot;, &quot;Bless You&quot;, &quot;Scared&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves You&quot; ‚Äì were not remixed). The remastered version featured an alternative cover. This new cover retained Lennon&#x27;s signature and hand-written title, but used one of the portraits Bob Gruen took for the album instead of Lennon&#x27;s childhood drawings. The bonus tracks for the reissue include &quot;Whatever Gets You thru The Night&quot; performed live with Elton John, a previously unreleased acoustic version of &quot;Nobody Loves You (When You&#x27;re Down And Out)&quot;, and a promotional interview with Lennon.

Capitol again reissued the album on 4 October 2010. This version was a remaster of the original album mixes and used the original cover art; the album was available separately or as part of the &quot;John Lennon Signature Box&quot;.

<text>The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics is part of the Max Planck Society, located in Garching, near Munich, Germany.
In 1991 the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics split up into the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, the Max Planck Institute for Physics and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics was founded as sub-institute in 1963. The scientific activities of the institute are mostly devoted to astrophysics with telescopes orbiting in space. A large amount of the resources are spent for studying black holes in the Milky Way Galaxy and in the remote universe.

== History ==

The Max-Planck-Institute for extraterrestrial physics (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial physics in the Max-Planck-Institute for physics and astrophysics. This department was established by Professor Reimar L√ºst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics and Astrophysics on May 15, 1963. Professor L√ºst was appointed director of the institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991, finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of Earth as well as astrophysical phenomena.

=== Detailed history ===
The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) was preceded by the department for extraterrestrial Physics in the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics. This department was established by Professor Reimar L√ºst on October 23, 1961. A Max-Planck Senate resolution transformed this department into a sub-institute of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics on May 15, 1963. Professor L√ºst was appointed director of the institute. Another Senate resolution on March 8, 1991, finally established MPE as an autonomous institute within the Max Planck Society. It is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical exploration of the space outside of Earth as well as astrophysical phenomena. A continuous reorientation to new, promising fields of research and the appointment of new members ensures steady advancement.

Among the 29 employees of the Institute when it was founded in 1963 were 9 scientists and 1 Ph.D. student. Twelve years later in 1975 the number of employees had grown to 180 with 55 scientists and 13 Ph.D. students, and today (status 2015) there are some 400 staff (130 scientists and 75 PhD students). It is noteworthy that permanent positions at the institute have not increased since 1973 - despite its celebrated scientific achievements. The increasingly complex tasks and international obligations have been mainly maintained by staff members with positions having limited duration and funded by external organizations.

Because the institute has assumed a leading position in astronomy internationally, it has attracted guest scientists throughout the world. The number of long-term guests increased from 12 in 1974 to a maximum of 72 in 2000. In recent years MPE has hosted an average of about 50 guest scientists each year.

During the early years, the scientific work at the Institute concentrated on the investigation of extraterrestrial plasmas and the magnetosphere of the Earth. This work was performed with measurements of particles and electromagnetic fields as well as a specially developed ion-cloud technique using sounding rockets.

Another field of research also became important: astrophysical observations of electromagnetic radiation which could not be observed from the surface of the Earth because the wavelengths are such that the radiation is absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These observations and inferences therefrom are the subject matter of infra-red astronomy as well as X-ray- and gamma-ray-astronomy. In addition to more than 100 rockets, an increasing number of high-altitude balloons (up to now more than 50; e.g. HEXE) have been used to carry experiments to high altitudes.

Since the 1990s, satellites have become the preferred observation platforms because of their favorable observation-time/cost ratio. Nevertheless, high-flying observation airplanes and ground-based telescopes are also used to obtain data, especially for optical and near-infrared observations.

New observation techniques using satellites has necessitated the recording, processing and accessible storage of high data fluxes over long periods of time. This demanding task is performed by a data processing group, which has grown quickly in the last decade. Special data centers were established for the large satellite projects.

Besides the many successes, there have also been disappointments. The malfunctioning of the Ariane carrier rockets on test launches in 1980 and 1996 were particularly bitter setbacks. The satellite &quot;Firewheel&quot;, in which many members of the Institute had invested years of work, was lost on May 23, 1980, because of a burning instability in the first stage of the launch rocket. The same fate was to overtake the four satellites of the CLUSTER-Mission on June 4, 1996, when the first Ariane 5 was launched. This time the disaster was attributed to an error in the rocket&#x27;s software. The most recent loss was &quot;ABRIXAS&quot;, an X-ray satellite built by industry under the leadership of MPE. After few hours in orbit, a malfunction of the power system caused the total loss of the satellite.

Over the years, however, the history of MPE is primarily a story of scientific successes.

== Scientific work ==

The institute was founded in 1963 as a sub-institute of the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Physik und Astrophysik and established as an independent institute in 1991.
Its main research topics are astronomical observations in spectral regions which are only accessible from space because of the absorbing effects of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, but also instruments on ground-based observatories are used whenever possible.
Scientific work is done in four major research areas that are supervised by one of the directors, respectively: optical and interpretative astronomy (Bender), infrared and sub-millimeter/millimeter astronomy (Genzel), high-energy astrophysics (Nandra), and in the Centre for Astrochemical Studies (Caselli). Within these areas scientists lead individual experiments and research projects organised in about 25 project teams. The research topics pursued at MPE range from the physics of cosmic plasmas and of stars to the physics and chemistry of interstellar matter, from star formation and nucleosynthesis to extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology.

Many experiments of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) have to be carried out above the dense Earth&#x27;s atmosphere using aircraft, rockets, satellites and space probes. In the early days experiments were also flown on balloons. To run advanced extraterrestrial physics and state-of-the-art experimental astrophysics, the institute continues to develop high-tech instrumentation in-house. This includes detectors, spectrometers, and cameras as well as telescopes and complete payloads (e.g. ROSAT and eROSITA) and even entire satellites (as in case of AMPTE and EQUATOR-S). For this purpose the technical and engineering departments are of particular importance for the institute&#x27;s research work.

Observers and experimenters perform their research work at the institute in close contact with each other. Their interaction while interpreting observations and propounding new hypotheses underlies the successful progress of the institute&#x27;s research projects.

At the end of the year 2022 a total of 508 employees were working at the institute, numbering among them about 100 scientists, 60 junior scientists, 10 apprentices and 140 visiting researchers.

== Projects ==

Scientific projects at the MPE are often the efforts of the different research departments to build, maintain, and use experiments and facilities which are needed by the many different scientific research interest at the institute. Apart from hardware projects, there are also projects that use archival data and are not necessarily connected to a new instrument. A brief overview of the most recent projects.
* For the EUCLID space telescope, which has been launched in July 2023 and from which researchers hope to gain new insights into dark matter and dark energy, the institute contributed the NISP optical system.
* The GRAVITY instrument enables the four 8-metre telescopes at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile to be interconnected by means of interferometry to form a virtual telescope with a diameter of 130 metres. The follow-up project GRAVITY Plus is currently being developed, which is expected to achieve an even sharper resolution thanks to a new system of adaptive optics, laser guide stars and an extended field of view.
* For the 39-metre European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), which is currently being built in the Chilean Atacama Desert and is planned to be finished by 2027, MPE is developing the first-light instrument MICADO (Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations).
* The ERIS (Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph) infrared camera will replace the NACO and SINFONI instruments at the VLT.
* With eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), the main instrument of the Russian X-ray gamma-ray satellite Spektr-RG launched from Baikonur in July 2019, the first complete sky survey in the X-ray range was achieved.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Latvia on 5 and 6 June 1993, the first after independence was restored in 1991. Latvian Way emerged as the largest party in the Saeima, winning 36 of the 100 seats. A total of 23 parties participated in the elections, although only eight received 4% or more of votes and won seats. Voter turnout was 91.2%, the highest in the country&#x27;s history. Only 66‚Äì75% of Latvian residents were citizens and qualified to vote, with the majority of those not able to vote being Russian.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
A coalition minority government was formed between Latvian Way and the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union. However, the coalition only commanded the support of 48 out of the 100 MPs, meaning that it was heavily reliant on opposition parties to ensure a parliamentary majority.

<text>Southam Inc., also known as Southam News, Southam Newspapers, and Southam Newswire, was a media company and news agency in Canada. Company founder William Southam started as a paper boy for the &quot;London Free Press&quot; and eventually went on to acquire many prominent daily newspapers across Canada such as the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, &quot;The Province&quot; and &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot; and created Southam Inc. in 1904 to run them. 

Through a series of transactions with Thomson Newspapers and FP Publications Ltd. between 1979 and 1980, Southam acquired monoplies in the Victoria, Vancouver, Alberta, Ottawa and Montreal markets for its daily papers. These acquisitions and paper closings directly caused the Canadian government to call, in September 1980, a royal commission on Newspapers, informally known as the Kent Commission. 

By the end of 1980s, Southam Inc. became Canada‚Äôs largest newspaper chain, with daily papers in most major urban centres. Hollinger Inc. gained control of the company in 1996 and it was eventually broken up and sold to media conglomerate Canwest in 2000. The brand continued on until 2003, when Canwest retired it in favour of its own branding for its newspaper chain and newswire. Since 2010, many former Southam newspapers are now owned by Postmedia Network Inc.

==History==
William Southam was the main force behind the company that bares his name, to manage his growing newspaper empire. Once a delivery boy for &quot;The London Free Press&quot;, he had risen up the ranks to become a part owner of the paper by 1867. He bought the failing &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot; in 1877 for $5,000 and turned its fortunes around. Beginning in 1897, Southam began acquiring other papers in the country including the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;The Province&quot;.
===1904‚Äì1979: A leading Canadian chain===
On March 11, 1904, Southam Limited was incorporated. The new company, with $1 million in capital, was set up to provide centralization for all of William Southam&#x27;s interests in many Canadian newspapers and printing plants. Beside William Southam on its board, it also included his sons: William J. South of Hamilton; Wilson M. Southam and Harry S. Southam, Ottawa; Richard Southam of Toronto, and Fred N. Southam, of Montreal. The sons ran the company newspapers and printing plants in those cities. 

Over the next 70-plus years, it grew into one of the largest newspaper chains in the country, with 17 daily newspapers and 56 community newspapers. As the newspaper chain expanded, the associated wire service, Southam News Service, was created and expanded with it.

===1979‚Äì1980: Reshaping Canada&#x27;s newspaper industry===
When FP Publications Ltd. closed the &quot;The Montreal Star&quot; ‚Äì at one time, Canada&#x27;s largest circulation newspaper until the 1950s ‚Äì in September 1979, it started a chain reaction of consolidation within the Canadian newspaper industry. The consolidation ended when Southam and Thomson traded papers in various locations across Canada in August 1980.

The 1980s opened with Thomson Newspapers Ltd. buying, in January 1980, FB Publications Ltd. This transaction included its chain, Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership, that at the time, owned Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, two Alberta papers, and a 50 percent share of Pacific Press Ltd which controlled two of Victoria, British Columbia newspapers, &quot;The Daily Colonist&quot; and &quot;The Victoria Times&quot;.

In early April 1980, the FP Publications brand was retired, and merged with Thomson under the Thomson Newspapers brand. In late April 1980, Thomson Newspaper bought the remaining FP Publication shares from Newsco Investments Ltd. ‚Äì controlled by former &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; owner, R. Howard Webster ‚Äì giving them 100 percent control of the company and its properties. 

By June 1980, the ramifications of the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; closing and Thomson&#x27;s acquisition of the Star&#x27;s parent company, FP Publications began to emerge. Southam Inc. had to sell Thomson Newspapers one-third of Montreal&#x27;s &quot;The Gazette&quot; to acquire the assets of the now closed &quot;Star&quot; paper.&lt;ref name = &quot;Thomson owns 1/3 of The Gazette&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Southam Inc. acted on the option to purchase from FP the &quot;Star&#x27;s&quot; assets, including its printing plant, for $16 million. Thomson, the successor company to FP, exercised its option to purchase a one-third ownership stake in &quot;The Gazette&quot; on June 12, 1980, as part of the agreement between Southam and FP.

Southam decided to close&quot;The Winnipeg Tribune&quot; on August 27, 1980, and Thomson Newspapers bought its assets. Thomson also closed &quot;The Ottawa Journal&quot; around the same time as the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot;, leaving Southam&#x27;s &quot;The Citizen&quot; as the only English-language newspaper in that market. The August 27, 1980 deals gave Southam monopolies in English-language newspaper markets such as Montreal (&quot;The Gazette&quot;), Ottawa (&quot;The Citizen&quot;), and in the Vancouver market (&quot;The Province&quot; &amp; &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot;) when they bought both Thomson&#x27;s minority shares in &quot;The Gazette&quot; and their 50 percent share in Pacific Press Ltd for $57,250,000.

Critics of the largest consolidation in Canadian newspaper history, up to that time, called it a failure in the Canadian government&#x27;s anti-combines legislation. Federal Opposition Leader, Joe Clark, called for a federal inquiry into Southam and Thomson&#x27;s dealings. But the publishers of the independent &quot;The Leader-Post&quot; and &quot;The Saskatoon Star-Phoenix&quot; thought the closures of &quot;The Journal&quot; and &quot;The Tribune&quot; might actually serve the public good better with one strong, and financially secure paper in each major urban centre, rather than two struggling ones.

In 1981, Southam purchased, the three-day-a-week newspaper, the &quot;Kamloops News&quot;. This gave Thompson a competitor to its &quot;Kamloops Sentinel&quot;.

===1996‚Äì2000: Sale to Hollinger===
Southam Newspapers was taken over by Hollinger Inc. in 1996, after Conrad Black gained a controlling stake in the company. Under Hollinger control, Southam made further acquisitions, including most of the British Columbia print media holdings of Thomson Newspapers. The purchase meant that Southam had a virtual monopoly on Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia&#x27;s newspaper market.

===2000‚Äì2003: Southam&#x27;s demise===
On November 15, 2000, the Southam Newspapers company was broken up with the print media holdings and the Southam Newspapers name being sold to media company Canwest. Canwest examined ways to integrate many of its smaller market papers into its Global television news division; however, it wasn&#x27;t to be. On August 10, 2002, Canwest sold eight Atlantic Canada and two Saskatchewan daily newspapers, 34 community papers, and two printing plants to Transcontinental Media including the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot;, and St. John&#x27;s&quot; The Telegram&quot;. The deal allowed Transcontinental to use its newly acquired Summerside, Prince Edward Island plant to print the Atlantic Canada version of the &quot;National Post&quot;. More CanWest papers were spun off to Osprey Media on January 28, 2003, when four Ontario daily newspapers joined that company: &quot;St. Catharines Standard&quot;, &quot;Brantford Expositor&quot;, &quot;Niagara Falls Review&quot;, and &quot;The Welland Tribune&quot;. 21 community weekly papers were also sold off to Osprey as well.

At the end of January 2003, Leonard Asper, CanWest&#x27;s president and CEO announced that the Southam corporate name was to be retired, and CanWest branding would be used in its place. The Southam family were happy with the name change, as they felt the Aspers were not running the chain within the traditions of that brand. CanWest News Service (CNS) began operating in Winnipeg in the second week of February 2003, replacing Southam Newspapers from bylines and mastheads. CNS moved its expanded operations to Ottawa in April 2007.

===2010: Postmedia buys Canwest===
Although defunct for seven years, Southam&#x27;s remnants were sold by Canwest on July 13, 2010, when its newspaper publishing division was spun off into a new company, Postmedia Network Ltd., led by National Post CEO, Paul Godfrey. Canwest&#x27;s broadcasting division, Canwest Global Media, was sold to Shaw Media earlier in the year, after an attempt by the Asper family to regain the company in court failed on February 19, 2010. Shaw closed out the deal when they came to an agreeement with Goldman-Sachs regarding Canwest&#x27;s speciality TV channels on May 3, 2010. The Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) approved the deal on October 22, 2010, and the deal was finalized on October 27, 2010, meaning CanWest Global Communications Inc. was no more.

==Criticism==
The Asper-owned Southam newspaper empire faced criticism when it fired Russell Mills as publisher of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, allegedly for criticizing Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, who was a good friend of Izzy Asper. Around the same time, the Southam family, and some Southam News journalists, signed their names to public advertisements criticizing CanWest‚Äôs head office for centralizing editorial control, with must-carry opinion pieces from management. According to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, this protest made it easier for Asper to drop the Southam name from its newspaper chain and put his own stamp on the company.

<doc id="614818" wikidata="Q862223" url="?curid=614818" title="H√ºsker D√º">
<text>H√ºsker D√º () was an American punk rock band formed in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1979. The band&#x27;s continuous members were guitarist/vocalist Bob Mould, bassist Greg Norton, and drummer/vocalist Grant Hart. They first gained notability as a hardcore punk band, and later crossed over into alternative rock. Mould and Hart were the band&#x27;s principal songwriters, with Hart&#x27;s higher-pitched vocals and Mould&#x27;s baritone taking the lead in alternating songs.

The band issued their debut studio album &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot; on Reflex Records in 1983 and subsequently released three LPs and an EP on the independent label SST Records, including the critically acclaimed &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; in 1984. H√ºsker D√º signed to major label Warner Bros. Records in 1986 to release their final two studio albums. They disbanded in 1988. Mould later released two solo albums before forming Sugar in the early 1990s, while Hart released a solo album on SST and later formed Nova Mob.

After their respective bands broke up in the mid-1990s, Mould and Hart continued doing solo work, the latter until his death in 2017. Norton worked as a restaurateur and returned to the recording industry in 2006.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1979‚Äì1980)===
The members of H√ºsker D√º first performed together when Grant Hart, Bob Mould, Greg Norton, and keyboardist Charlie Pine began playing in January 1979. At the time, Mould was a freshman at Macalester College in Saint Paul and frequented nearby Cheapo Records, a Saint Paul record store where Hart was a sales clerk. Hart and Norton had originally met while applying for the same job, which Norton eventually got. Hart and Mould bonded over a shared love of the Ramones. According to an interview with Mould by Terry Katzman in &quot;City Pages&quot; in 1980, Mould, Hart and Norton first met in person at a concert featuring the Ramones and Foreigner, and quickly became friends. Soon after, they enlisted Norton and Pine to form a band. They began gigging, playing mostly cover songs, some classic rock, and frequent Ramones tunes. Unbeknownst to Pine, the remaining band members disliked the sound of the band with Pine&#x27;s keyboards and began practicing without him, writing a few originals.

The new name originated during a rehearsal of the Talking Heads&#x27;s &quot;Psycho Killer.&quot; Unable to recall the French portions sung in the original (e.g., &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que &quot;), they instead started shouting any foreign-language words they could remember, including the title of the popular 1970s memory board game H≈´sker D≈´? (the phrase without diacritics meaning &quot;do you remember?&quot; in Danish and Norwegian). The name stuck, and they added heavy metal umlauts to it. Mould said that they liked the somewhat mysterious qualities of the name and that it set them apart from other hardcore punk groups with names like &quot;Social Red Youth Dynasty Brigade Distortion.&quot; Mould also said that, while H√ºsker D√º enjoyed hardcore punk in general, they never thought of themselves as exclusively a hardcore group and that their name was an attempt to avoid being pigeonholed as such.

Hart, Mould, and Norton fired Pine during their third performance on April 20, 1979, and continued as a trio. Mould has written that he considers the band&#x27;s first &quot;real gig&quot; to have been May 17, 1980, at the renowned punk club Jay&#x27;s Longhorn Bar.

By 1980, the band was performing regularly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and their music evolved into a fast, ferocious, primal sound, making them one of the original hardcore punk bands of the Midwest. Through heavy touring, they soon caught the attention of punk trailblazers including Black Flag and Dead Kennedys&#x27; Jello Biafra, who helped introduce H√ºsker D√º to new fans. Black Flag guitarist/songwriter Greg Ginn later signed the band to his label, SST Records.

===Early releases (1981‚Äì1983)===
The band released the &quot;Statues&quot; single on their own Reflex Records in January 1981. Playing a show in Chicago brought them to the attention of the Black Flag. When H√ºsker D√º were ready to release their first album &quot;Land Speed Record&quot;, Black Flag&#x27;s label, SST, was not able to release it at that time and pointed them to the Minutemen who did release it and the 7&quot; EP &quot;In a Free Land&quot; on their label, New Alliance Records. The band was hoping to release their next record, the mini album &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot;, on SST, but the label still wasn&#x27;t in the position to do so and they ended up putting it out on Reflex. SST was finally able to release their next record, the &quot;Metal Circus&quot; EP, in 1983.

H√ºsker D√º&#x27;s more melodic take on hardcore struck a chord with college students, and various tracks from &quot;Metal Circus&quot;, particularly Hart&#x27;s &quot;Diane,&quot; were put into rotation by dozens of campus radio stations across the U.S. In addition, on &quot;Metal Circus&quot; the band showed more invention, skill, and melody than it did over the course of their previous full album, &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot;. In a 1983 interview, Mould recalled the reason the band turned down an offer to sign with major-label Elektra Records during the band&#x27;s first few years:

While the band at this time was still firmly rooted in the loud, fast punk rock style, the trio were beginning to experiment with songs featuring a more melodic, though no less aggressive, sound. &quot;The early H√ºsker stuff was all very fast and furious,&quot; Mould reflected in 1997, &quot;as a result of being 18 and not really proficient with the instruments. But I was always writing with an ear to melody.&quot;

===&quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, &quot;New Day Rising&quot; and &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; (1983‚Äì1985)===

By 1983, the members of H√ºsker D√º wanted to create music outside of the confines and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with &quot;Matter&quot; in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, &quot;We&#x27;re going to try to do something bigger than anything like rock &amp; roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to be, we have to work that out, but it&#x27;s going to go beyond the whole idea of &#x27;punk rock&#x27; or whatever.&quot;

The following year, H√ºsker D√º recorded the double album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band&#x27;s audience beyond the punk community. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; David Fricke described &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; as &quot;the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.&quot;

In 1989, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; was ranked No. 33 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;‚Ä≥s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on the side of caution and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band&#x27;s tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.
H√ºsker D√º started recording &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;‚Ä≥s follow-up album, &quot;New Day Rising&quot;, just as &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; was released. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot;, was released nine months after &quot;New Day Rising&quot;. &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; became the first album released on an independent record label to top the &quot;CMJ&quot; album chart.

At year&#x27;s end, both &quot;New Day Rising&quot; and &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; ranked in the top ten of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. The swift succession of dynamic albums highlighted the creative evolution of the band.

===Signing with Warner Bros.; &quot;Candy Apple Grey&quot; (1985‚Äì1986)===
During the recording sessions for &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot;, Warner Bros. Records approached H√ºsker D√º and offered the group a recording contract. The band felt it had hit a sales ceiling that it could break through only with the help of a larger label. The promise of the band retaining complete creative control over its music convinced the band to sign with the label. Mould also cited distribution problems with SST as a reason for the move, noting that sometimes there were no records to sign at promotional events.

H√ºsker D√º was not expected to sell a large number of records. Rather, Warner Bros. valued the group&#x27;s grassroots fanbase and &quot;hip&quot; status, and by keeping the overhead low, the label anticipated the band would turn a profit.

&quot;Candy Apple Grey&quot; was their first major-label album, though Warner Bros. had initially lobbied to release &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; until the band opted for its release on SST. &quot;Candy Apple Grey&quot; was the first H√ºsker D√º album to chart on the Billboard Top 200, but despite receiving exposure on radio as well as MTV, it could get no higher than No.¬†140.

===&quot;Warehouse: Songs and Stories&quot; and breakup (1987‚Äì1988)===
Creative and personal tensions between Mould and Hart intensified. With Mould already doing most of the band&#x27;s managerial duties, bringing in David Savoy to help with that end, Savoy&#x27;s suicide on the eve of the band&#x27;s 1987 tour in support of the double album &quot;&quot; threw the band into a tailspin. In September 2006, Hart told Britain&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;I take full responsibility for [Savoy&#x27;s] suicide. It was a direct result of the pressure of working for Bob and me, because he was being forced into a two-faced situation.&quot; Mould called Savoy&#x27;s suicide &quot;the beginning of the end.&quot;

The promotional tour for &quot;Warehouse: Songs and Stories&quot; included some of the highest profile television appearances in the band&#x27;s career, including performances on &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; and the NBC morning news program &quot;Today&quot;.

The band dissolved after a show in Columbia, Missouri, on the band&#x27;s December 1987 tour. Hart was trying to quit heroin using a supply of methadone, but the bottle had leaked. Hart still played the show, but Mould and Norton were concerned he would be unable to play the remaining shows due to withdrawal. While Hart insisted he could perform, Mould had already canceled the remaining dates. Mould has said that the breakup was about &quot;three people going their separate ways,&quot; referring to Hart&#x27;s drug use and new relationship, Norton&#x27;s recent marriage and new business, and Mould himself having quit a lifelong drinking habit back in 1986. After a band meeting on January 26, 1988, Mould decided to leave the band and made it official two days later.

&quot;The Living End&quot;, a live collection taken from the band&#x27;s October 1987 tour, was released in 1994. Mould has said he has never listened to this album.

===Post-breakup (1989‚Äìpresent)===

Mould and Hart produced solo albums and formed the bands Sugar and Nova Mob, respectively. Mould also joined Richard Morel in the band Blowoff. In 2005, after retiring from playing shows with an electric band in 1998, Mould returned to touring with a band and included H√ºsker D√º and Sugar songs in his sets. His album &quot;Silver Age&quot;, which came soon after the reissue of Sugar&#x27;s two full-length albums in 2012, was widely acclaimed as a return to form. Mould&#x27;s backing band features Jason Narducy (Verbow, Split Single) and Jon Wurster (Superchunk, The Mountain Goats) on bass and drums, respectively. Norton formed the band Grey Area, played with Shotgun Rationale, and became a chef. He and his ex-wife Sarah owned a restaurant in Red Wing, Minnesota, called The Nortons&#x27;, until 2010. In addition to his restaurant duties, in 2006 Norton returned to music as the bassist for the Minnesota-based band The Gang Font, featuring Interloper. The group released an eponymous album in 2007. In 2016, Norton also joined the Wisconsin indie rock band Porcupine, actively performing and recording with them.

On October 21, 2004, Mould and Hart reunited at a Minneapolis benefit concert for ailing Soul Asylum bassist Karl Mueller, who had been receiving treatment for cancer. At the end of what had been scheduled as a solo set by Mould, he brought out Hart to play &quot;Never Talking To You Again&quot; and &quot;Hardly Getting Over It&quot;. Mould noted that the performance should not ignite any &quot;false hope&quot; for a reunion.

On October 12, 2015, H√ºsker D√º launched an official website, which is an online merchandise store. Norton told the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; that he, Mould, and Hart had worked out a licensing agreement for their music and that a Facebook page is &quot;likely to go online soon.&quot; When asked about a possible H√ºsker D√º reunion, Norton replied, &quot;The main thing is, there&#x27;s ongoing communication between the three of us now.&quot;

Hart died of liver cancer on September 13, 2017, at the age of 56. In a public statement, Mould remembered his former bandmate as &quot;a gifted visual artist, a wonderful storyteller, and a frighteningly talented musician. Everyone touched by his spirit will always remember.&quot;

On November 10, 2017, the Numero Group label released the three-CD/four-LP box set &quot;Savage Young D√º&quot;, which spans the band&#x27;s first four years, containing demos, studio, and live recordings.

On March 30, 2019, the 40th anniversary of the first H√ºsker D√º show in St. Paul, Bob Mould played a concert in St. Paul, in which he was supported by the band Porcupine, featuring Greg Norton. To commemorate the occasion, both former H√ºsker D√º members paid tribute to their late bandmate Grant Hart, and included one of his songs in their sets, with Mould performing &quot;Never Talking to You Again&quot; and Porcupine performing their cover of &quot;Standing by the Sea&quot;.

==Musical style==
H√ºsker D√º started as a hardcore punk band. Huw Baines of Guitar.com said &quot;If there‚Äôs one word that describes H√ºsker D√º it‚Äôs speed.&quot; While the band included some slower material earlier in its career, H√ºsker D√º developed a fast repertoire as a result of having less time to play while billed as an opening act, and to antagonize their audience when it headlined shows. &quot;[T]here was a point where we were, like, &#x27;Let&#x27;s see how fast we can play,&#x27;&quot; Norton recalled. &quot;I guess we were just trying to blow people away.&quot; H√ºsker D√º was particularly influenced by punk bands like D.O.A., Dead Kennedys, and The Fartz after seeing them play. &quot;NME&quot; journalist Andy Gill contended that H√ºsker D√º&#x27;s characteristic sound crystalized on the &quot;Metal Circus&quot; EP, incorporating &quot;thunderbuck, hiccup&quot; drums, a melodic yet solid bass, and &quot;carillions [sic] of distorted guitar, with shouted vocals rasping hoarsely from deep in the mix.&quot; He argued that what set them apart from other punk bands was &quot;the way they mix those same structural devices in ways that shouldn&#x27;t work, combining elements of several genres in one song.&quot;

As the band&#x27;s career progressed, H√ºsker D√º emphasized melody in their songs. Unlike other hardcore bands, H√ºsker D√º did not disavow classic rock. &quot;You know the whole deal with tearing down the old to make room for the new?&quot; Hart posited. &quot;Well, music isn&#x27;t city planning.&quot; The band covered 1960s hits like Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; and the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; early in their career. As the band members progressed as musicians, they discovered they were able to play at slower tempos while still maintaining the rhythm, allowing for extended melodies.

Hart and Mould were the band&#x27;s songwriters. Both wrote their songs separately and at a prodigious pace. In later years, Hart accused Mould of making sure his songs comprised no more than 45 percent of the material on an album. They designed their logo to represent their common train of thought‚Äîa circle enclosing three parallel horizontal lines with a vertical line connecting them. The circle symbolized the band: the three lines were the individual members, and the intersecting line was the common thread of creativity that connected them.

Critically, the band has been labeled as primarily hardcore punk, post-hardcore, punk rock, and alternative rock. They have also been labeled as noise pop and post-punk. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, H√ºsker D√º&#x27;s music combined the &quot;screaming self-examination of Bob Mould with the biting pop-romanticism of Grant Hart.
==Legacy==

H√ºsker D√º is widely regarded as one of the key bands to emerge from the 1980s American indie scene. Music writer Michael Azerrad asserted in his 2001 book &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; that H√ºsker D√º was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, &quot;H√ºsker D√º played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren&#x27;t antithetical.&quot; According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the band laid the groundwork for the &quot;roaring punk-pop&quot; that achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s, explaining, &quot;Not only did they shape the sound of the music, they shaped the way independent bands made the transition to the major labels; they showed other bands that it was possible to record uncompromising music on a major label without losing any integrity or creative control.&quot; The band helped set a new precedent by being one of the first bands from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as &quot;a viable commercial enterprise.&quot; According to &quot;Consequence&quot;, &quot;the band‚Äôs near-flawless trifecta of &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, &quot;New Day Rising&quot;, and &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; ‚Äì all recorded between 1984 and 1985 ‚Äì pretty much penned the sonic script for every guitar rock band that followed in its wake.&quot;

Kim Deal joined Pixies in response to a classified ad placed by Black Francis seeking a female bassist who liked both Peter, Paul and Mary and H√ºsker D√º.

Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic said that Nirvana&#x27;s musical style was &quot;nothing new; H√ºsker D√º did it before us.&quot;

Northern Irish alternative rock band Therapy? covered &quot;Diane&quot; on their 1995 album, &quot;Infernal Love&quot;. The song was released as a single. Frontman Andy Cairns has cited H√ºsker D√º as an influence, and additionally listed &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; as his seventh-favorite album of all time.

Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong said, &quot;There are no words that describe the huge impact Grant Hart and Bob Mould&#x27;s music [had] on Green Day. We were 16 years old. H√ºsker D√º was our favorite band. We became a three-piece because of H√ºsker. We went through adolescence listening to this band. I wanted to be a songwriter because of H√ºsker D√º. To put it simply, there would be no Green Day if it wasn&#x27;t for H√ºsker D√º.

Steve Brooks of Torche and Floor said, ‚ÄúH√ºsker D√º changed my life. That was a huge influence on me.&quot; The bands have often been compared to each other, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described Torche as &quot;the legitimate sons of a union between H√ºsker D√º and The Melvins.&quot;

Additionally, H√ºsker D√º has been cited as an influence by Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, the Offspring, Inspiral Carpets, the Hold Steady, Better Than Ezra frontman Kevin Griffin, Superchunk, Rites of Spring, Buffalo Tom, and Treepeople.

In an interview with Dave Fanning for RT√â&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock Profiles&quot; before the Foo Fighters&#x27; appearance at the 1996 F√©ile Festival, Dave Grohl said of &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, &quot;That album was amazing. I mean, Black Flag was early on, and then when I discovered &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; I thought, &quot;God, these people write songs, man&quot;. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s like the Byrds meets Black Flag, and it just blew me away, and the songs just stuck in your head forever and they were just amazing. When that album, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;, was recorded...I think it was recorded just straight, and I think they all took acid and recorded it in 48 hours. They did the whole album. That is what I had heard. And, to me, I was just like, &quot;God, these people are genius&quot;, you know? &quot;This is... this is amazing&quot;.&quot;

H√ºsker D√º has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue; Mould and Hart have also received stars for their solo work, making the band one of the few to be represented multiple times on the mural. The stars recognize performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<text>Sundridge is a village in central Ontario, Canada, approximately 75¬†km south of North Bay, Ontario along Highway 11, on the shore of Lake Bernard. Sundridge is a tourist destination in both winter and summer, with boating and snowmobiling providing the main attraction. Algonquin Provincial Park is accessible nearby. Cities within a reasonable driving distance include Toronto (approximately 275¬†km south) and Ottawa (approximately 400¬†km east.) The village has long been known as &quot;The Pearl of the North&quot; to residents of central and northern Ontario. The village is located in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound District.
==History==
Originally it was supposed to be named Sunny Ridge, but when the name was applied for in the late 1800s, an error at the post office department resulted in the name becoming Sundridge.

Sundridge developed largely as a result of the extension of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) northward. The first settler in the area ‚Äì usually considered the village&#x27;s founder ‚Äì was James Dunbar in 1876. The CNR route in the area was completed in 1885, and the Village of Sundridge was incorporated in 1889. Protestant churches (Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian) were established in the mid-1880s, and in 1897 the first municipal library was established. During World War I, Sundridge was the location for basic training for the 162nd Canadian Battalion.

The post office dates from 1879.

<doc id="614825" wikidata="Q151435" url="?curid=614825" title="Montserrat Caball√©">
<text>Mar√≠a de Montserrat Bibiana Concepci√≥n Caball√© i Folch or Folc (12 April 1933 ‚Äì 6 October 2018), known simply as Montserrat Caball√© (i Folch), was a Spanish operatic soprano from Catalonia. Widely considered to be one of the best sopranos of the 20th century, she won a variety of musical awards thoroughout her six-decade career, including three Grammy Awards.

Caball√© performed a wide variety of roles, but is best known as an exponent of the works of Verdi and of the bel canto repertoire, notably the works of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. She was noticed internationally when she stepped in for a performance of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; at Carnegie Hall in 1965, and then appeared at leading opera houses. Her voice was described as pure but powerful, with superb control of vocal shadings and exquisite pianissimo.

Caball√© is also known for her 1987 duet with Freddie Mercury, &quot;Barcelona&quot;, later used for the 1992 Olympic Games. The two had mutual admiration for each other and developed a close friendship.

==Early life==
Caball√© was born in Barcelona on 12 April 1933. Her family was of humble financial circumstances due to the Civil War. She studied music at the Liceu Conservatory, and singing technique with Napoleone Annovazzi, Eugenia Kem√©ny and Conchita Bad√≠a. She graduated with a gold medal in 1954. She subsequently moved to Basel, Switzerland, where she made her professional debut in 1956 as a last minute replacement as Mim√¨ in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La boh√®me&quot;. 

She became part of the Basel Opera company between 1957 and 1959, singing a repertoire that included Mozart (Erste Dame in &quot;Die Zauberfl√∂te&quot;) and Strauss (&quot;Salome&quot;) in German, unusual for Spanish singers, but which proved useful for her next engagement at the Bremen Opera (1959‚Äì1962). In 1961, she starred as Iphig√©nie in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphig√©nie en Tauride&quot; at the National Theatre of S. Carlos in Lisbon, alongside Raymond Wolansky, Jean Cox, Paul Sch√∂ffler and others.

In 1962, Caball√© returned to Barcelona and debuted at the Liceu, singing the title role in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Arabella&quot;. From the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1963 she toured Mexico, at one point singing the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. This was followed by several more successful appearances at the Liceu in 1963.

==International success==
Caball√©&#x27;s international breakthrough came in 1965 when she replaced a pregnant Marilyn Horne in a semi-staged performance of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, which earned her a 25-minute standing ovation. While this was her first engagement in a bel canto opera and she had to learn the role in less than one month, her performance made her famous throughout the opera world. Later that year, Caball√© made her debut at the Glyndebourne Festival singing her first Marschallin in Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and portraying the role of Countess Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. Ryland Davies, who sang the Major Domo alongside Caball√© in Der Rosenkavalier, told an anecdote about her. Onstage, she unexpectedly asked him for a cognac. 

Exiting stage left, he was met by an alarmed stage assistant, who was dispatched to the Long Bar to fetch one. Returning to the stage, he delivered the cognac to Caball√© with the words &quot;Ecco, Signora!&quot; Whispering &quot;Grazie, grazie!&quot;, she turned her back on the audience, drained the glass and continued in her role: &quot;Abtreten die Leut!&quot; (&quot;Send everyone away.&quot;)

In December 1965, she returned to Carnegie Hall for her second bel canto opera, singing the role of Queen Elizabeth I in Donizetti&#x27;s recently rediscovered &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;. Caball√© closed out the year with her Metropolitan Opera debut on 22 December 1965, appearing as Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; alongside John Alexander in the title role, Justino D√≠az as M√©phistoph√©l√®s, and Sherrill Milnes as Valentin in his debut at the Met.
In 1966, Caball√© made her first appearance with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Maddalena di Coigny in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Ch√©nier&quot; and her Italian debut at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino as Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, followed by Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot; in 1967. She returned to Philadelphia in 1967 to sing the title roles in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, and to the Met to sing three Verdi heroines: Leonora alongside Richard Tucker as Manrico in &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot; with James McCracken in the title role, and Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, with Tucker and George Shirley alternating as Alfredo. She returned to the Met the following year in the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;, and in 1969 for the role of Li√π in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, with Birgit Nilsson in the title role and James King as Cal√†f. She also returned to Philadelphia as Imogene in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot; (1968) and Lucrezia Borgia (1969).

In 1969, Caball√© appeared at the Arena di Verona in a Jean Vilar production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;. She was Elisabetta of Valois in an all-star cast including Pl√°cido Domingo and Piero Cappuccilli. In the same period she also appeared in recital at the Teatro Corallo in Verona. In 1970, Caball√© made her official debut at La Scala in the title role of &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;. She appeared as Leonora in Philadelphia, and returned to the Met as Amelia in a critically acclaimed production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; with Domingo as Riccardo, and Reri Grist as Oscar.

In 1972, she made her first appearances at Covent Garden and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, both in the role of Violetta. That same year she returned to the Met as Elisabetta in &quot;Don Carlo&quot; with Franco Corelli in the title role, and sang the title role of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; in Philadelphia. In 1973 she returned to Chicago to perform the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; with Viorica Cortez but left mid contract because she was suffering with phlebitis. This marked her final performance at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. That same year she performed at the Met as Bellini&#x27;s Norma, opposite Carlo Cossutta in his Met debut as Pollione and Fiorenza Cossotto as Adalgisa.
In 1974, Caball√© appeared in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at the Liceu in January, in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; at the Met in March, and in &quot;Parisina d&#x27;Este&quot; at Carnegie Hall, also in March. She appeared as Norma at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and in &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; at La Scala in April. She was filmed as Norma in Orange in July by Pierre Jourdain. She recorded &quot;Aida&quot; with Riccardo Muti in July and made a recording of duets with Giuseppe Di Stefano in August. In September 1974, she underwent major surgery to remove a large benign mass from her abdomen. She recovered and was performing again onstage by early 1975. In 1976 Caball√© appeared at the Met once again as Norma and sang her first Aida in that house, alongside Robert Nagy as Radam√®s and Marilyn Horne as Amneris. She appeared in the title role of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss and sang Mim√¨ in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La boh√®me&quot; with Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo.

In 1977 Caball√© made her debut with the San Francisco Opera in the title role of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. She returned to that house ten more times over the next decade in such roles as Elvira in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot; and the title roles in Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot;, and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, among others.

Having lost some of her earlier brilliance and purity of voice, Caball√© offered more dramatic expressive singing in roles that demanded it. In 1978, she was Tosca in San Francisco with Pavarotti, Norma in Madrid, and Adriana Lecouvreur at the Met opposite Jos√© Carreras. She continued to appear often at the Met during the 1980s, in roles such as Tosca (1980, 1985) and Elisabetta (1985), and also sang concerts in 1981 and 1983. She gave her final performances at the Met in October 1985 as &quot;Tosca&quot; with Pavarotti as Cavaradossi and Cornell MacNeil as Scarpia.

Her voice was noted for its purity, precise control, and power. She was admired less for her dramatic instincts and acting skills than for her superb technique, vocal shadings, and exquisite pianissimos, which were inspired by Miguel Fleta.

==Later years==
In Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, Caball√© recorded both the title role (for RCA Red Seal in 1972, with Domingo as Pollione) and later the role of Adalgisa, to Joan Sutherland&#x27;s Norma in a 1984 Decca recording conducted by Richard Bonynge. Although Bellini conceived the role of Adalgisa originally for a soprano, it is usually now sung by a mezzo-soprano. Caball√© was one of few sopranos to have recorded the role, although she was over age 50 at the time of the recording in 1984. In 1986, she also took a role in the biographic film &quot;Romanza final&quot;, directed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Forqu√©.
In 1987, Caball√© made a rare excursion into the world of pop music when she released a duet with Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the rock band Queen, which was titled &quot;Barcelona&quot;. The song was inspired by Caball√©&#x27;s home city and later used as one of the two official theme songs for the 1992 Olympic Games. Mercury was a great admirer of Caball√©, considering her voice to be &quot;the best in the world&quot;. The single was followed by an album of the same name which was released the following year and featured further collaborations between the two performers. The title track later became the anthem of the 1992 Summer Olympics which was hosted by Caball√©&#x27;s native city, and appeared again in the pop music charts throughout Europe. Caball√© also performed the song live, accompanied by a recording by Mercury, who had died in 1991, before the 1999 UEFA Champions League final in Barcelona&#x27;s Camp Nou stadium.

In 1994, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Fiammetta Rocco said: &quot;Caballe is one of the last of the true divas. Callas is dead, Kiri Te Kanawa is busy making commercials for Sainsbury&#x27;s, and Mirella Freni has never really risen out of the narrow confines of being an opera lover&#x27;s opera-singer. Caballe, on the other hand, has always had an enormous following, and it&#x27;s still with her today.&quot;

In 1995, she worked with Vangelis for his album &quot;El Greco&quot;, dedicated to the Greek painter. In 1997, Mike Moran produced the album &quot;Friends For Life&quot;, which includes duets with Caball√© and such singers as Bruce Dickinson, Johnny Hallyday, Johnny Logan, Gino Vannelli, and Helmut Lotti.

Caball√© dedicated herself to various charities. She was a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and established a foundation for needy children in Barcelona. In 2003, she starred in her own documentary film &quot;Caball√©: Beyond Music&quot;, which featured many well-known opera singers, including Domingo, Pavarotti, Carreras, and Ren√©e Fleming.

In 2002, she appeared as Catherine of Aragon in &quot;Henri VIII&quot; by Saint-Sa√´ns, and in 2004 in the title role of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Cl√©op√¢tre&quot;, both at the Liceu. She appeared as The Duchess of Crakenthorp in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du r√©giment&quot; at the Vienna State Opera in April 2007.

In 2003, Patrick O&#x27;Connor wrote in &quot;Gramophone&quot; that:

On 6 June 2013, Caball√© was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Azerbaijan after visiting the de facto independent state of Nagorno-Karabakh and meeting with local leaders, despite official warnings issued by the Azerbaijani embassy in Spain.

==Tax evasion==
In 2015 Caball√© was under prosecution over allegations of tax evasion or fraud. She admitted that despite living in Spain in 2010, she had registered in Andorra in order to avoid paying tax in Spain. In December 2015 the Spanish court found her guilty of fraud and gave her a six-month suspended jail sentence, ordering her to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨254,231. She was also banned from receiving any public subsidies for 18 months.

==Family==

Caball√© married Spanish tenor Bernab√© Mart√≠ (1928‚Äì2022) on 14 August 1964 at Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey. They had two children, including Montserrat Mart√≠, who is also an operatic soprano.

==Health problems and death==
On 20 October 2012, during her tour in Russia, Caball√© suffered a stroke in Yekaterinburg and was quickly transferred to the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona.

In September 2018, she was admitted to the same hospital for a gallbladder problem. She died there on 6 October 2018 at the age of 85. The cause of death was not given. Felipe VI of Spain described Caball√© as &quot;the best of the best&quot;, and Spanish prime minister Pedro S√°nchez called her the great ambassador of Spain. Caball√© was buried in the Cementiri de Sant Andreu in Barcelona.

==Recordings==
Caball√© recorded extensively throughout her long career and made many notable recordings of complete operas as well as recital albums. After a number of recordings early in her career for RCA Victor Red Seal, Caball√© also recorded for EMI, Decca, and Philips among other labels. She left a &quot;vast discography&quot; of her major roles, including Aida, conducted by Riccardo Muti, Elisabetta in &quot;Don Carlo&quot; conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini, Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte&quot; with Colin Davis, Li√π in &quot;Turandot&quot; alongside Joan Sutherland and Pavarotti, conducted by Zubin Mehta, and Salome with Erich Leinsdorf. She recorded many bel canto and Rossini roles. Recital recordings include a Puccini collection with Charles Mackerras, a Strauss collection with Leonard Bernstein, and duets with Shirley Verrett. She recorded the soprano solo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with John Barbirolli in 1969, and Zubin Mehta in 1980.

<text>Gito Baloi (September 30, 1964 ‚Äì April 4, 2004) was an Mozambican musician. Originally known for his collaborations and as a member of the trio Tananas, he also released solo albums as vocalist and bassist: &quot;Ekhaya&quot; (1995), ‚ÄúNa Ku Randza&quot; (1997), &quot;Herbs &amp; Roots&quot; (2003) and the posthumously-released &quot;Beyond&quot; (2008).

Recognised by his haunting vocals and lead bass style, Baloi is regarded a pioneer of African Jazz and as one of the most respected guitarists from Southern Africa.

== Early life ==
Felix Garcao do Rosario Serafim Bernardo Baloi, better known by his nickname &quot;Gito&quot;, was born in Matola, Mozambique. He grew up on his family&#x27;s farm, near Maputo, with his mother, father, and siblings. He was the oldest son. Gito was a musical child; he taught himself how to play music, building his own instruments out of discarded paraffin tins, oil drums and reeds. His early influences included Jaco Pastorius and Bob Marley. At 14, he borrowed a bass guitar and performed for the villagers to help support his family. As a teenager, Gito left home to avoid being forced to fight in the civil war. On foot, he headed for South Africa with a few friends.

== Music career ==
Before his death, Gito had traveled extensively, working with a numerous musicians locally and internationally. Starting out in South Africa, Gito toured with a group called Pongolo during 1986. In 1987, Tananas was formed by Gito, Ian Herman and Steve Newman. The band gained global attention, leading them to perform in America, Australia, France, Japan, Sweden and various other countries around the world. On separate occasions, he shared the stage with Paul Simon of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Peter Gabriel of Genesis, Sting of The Police, as well as Phil Manzanera, Tracy Chapman and Youssou N&#x27;Dour.

Gito worked with Jason Armstrong in 1996 and 2000 on two albums, Desert Voices, and played bass in the band Somewhere Else along with Armstrong (keyboards), George Sunday (guitar) and Gaston Goliath (drums) during 1993.

One particular project he was involved with was The Shuttle Band, which featured musicians from Europe and South Africa. He was also a part of world music group Mondetta, consisting of artists from Israel, Canada, Korea and South Africa.

Baloi sang vocals for the song &quot;Mountain Wind&quot; on the album &quot;Bush Telegraph&quot; by Landscape Prayers, and was also credited on the album for production and mixing. In 2004, Baloi recorded &quot;Sweet-Thorn&quot;, a duo album with Landscape Prayers guitarist, Nibs van der Spuy.

In 2008, &quot;Beyond&quot;, a posthumous album, was released, with 100% of its proceeds going to the Gito Baloi Memorial Trust, which was set up for Baloi&#x27;s children. Gito had begun recording the 10 tracks and the production was completed by Dave Reynolds and guests including Steve Newman (Tananas), Paul Hanmer, Ian Herman (Tananas), McCoy Mrubata, Moses Khumalo, Pedro Da Silva Pinto (340ml), Tlale Makhene, Tony Cox, Frank Paco, Nibs van der Spuy, Deepak Ram, Rui Soeiro (340ml), Bernice Boikanyo, Paulo Chibanga (340ml), Thuli Mdlalose, Eliot Short, Vusi Maseko and Graeme Sacks.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="614828" wikidata="Q1388799" url="?curid=614828" title="Divine Intervention (2002 film)">
<text>Divine Intervention () is a 2002 film by Palestinian director Elia Suleiman, which may be described as a surreal black comedy. The film consists largely of a series of brief interconnected sketches, but for the most part records a day in the life of a Palestinian living in Nazareth, whose girlfriend lives several checkpoints away in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

One lyrical section features a sunglasses-clad Palestinian woman (played by Manal Khader) whose passing by not only distracts all eyes, but whose gaze causes Israeli military checkpoint towers to crumble. The director features prominently as the film&#x27;s silent, expressionless protagonist in a performance that has been compared to the work of Buster Keaton, Jim Jarmusch and Jacques Tati.

The film is noted for its minimal use of dialogue, its slow pace and repetition in behavior by its characters.

==Cast==
* Elia Suleiman as E.S.
* Manal Khader as The Woman
* Nayef Fahoum Daher as E.S.&#x27;s Father
* Denis Sandler Sapoznikov as Israeli soldier on Palestinian-Israeli border
* Menashe Noy as Soldier at Checkpoint.

==Plot==

Divine Intervention while being a series of interconnected sketches, is a glimpse at life of Palestinians living under military occupation going in between the cities of Nazareth and Ramallah. E.S. lives in Nazareth while his father lives in Ramallah. We begin the film focusing on life in Ramallah with the Father for the first part of the film, bouncing between different stories of the neighbors within this area and the conflicts they undergo. Disputes between neighbors, Israeli police coming and going, the seizing of Palestinian owned things and places by the Israeli settlers, Palestinians interacting with/watching one another, etc.

In the second part of the film, E.S.&#x27;s Father has fallen ill and is in the hospital, he must now enter Ramallah and visit his father. While going in between Nazareth and Ramallah, E.S. begins meeting with The Woman in their cars at the border checkpoint between the two cities. The couple&#x27;s clandestine meetings continue to take place throughout the rest of the film. In them we also observe the Israeli military guards at the checkpoint as they interact with the Palestinians who are crossing into Nazareth. 

The film is characterized by a lack of dialogue. The characters of the film are only able to observe the happenings of their everyday life without being able to interfere much as they are under military occupation and must adhere to it. 
Sketches:

In Nazareth, Santa Claus runs away from children as gifts fall from his basket. He&#x27;s been stabbed and leans against the ruin of a Franciscan chapel atop Mount Fear.

E.S.&#x27;s Father curses familiar faces as he drives through the streets.

Neighbors bicker over small stuff.

A Palestinian couple meets in a car at the border checkpoint between Ramallah and Nazareth. 

More bickering neighbors.

A tourist asks an Israeli policeman for directions. Unable to help her himself, the policeman brings out a blindfolded Palestinian prisoner from the back of his van. The Palestinian tells her three different possible routes.

The couple is in the car again. The man (E.S.) blows up a red balloon with the face of Yasser Arafat drawn on it. He releases it near an Israeli checkpoint. An Israeli soldier is about to shoot it down but his comrade stops him. In the confusion, the couple are able to drive through the checkpoint together. The balloon floats across Jerusalem, eventually settling against the Dome of the Rock.

At night, the couple again in a car.

The next morning, five Israeli men practice an elaborate sequence of dance-like moves. Armed with guns, they repeatedly fire at targets painted like a Palestinian woman under the direction of a choreographer-officer. When one of the targets fails to fall to the ground, a real Palestinian woman (dressed like the targets) appears. The officer instructs his men to fire at her. In a supernatural feat, she gathers their bullets in the air around her and rises from the ground. The bullets form a crown of thorns around her head until she lets them fall to the ground. She then uses crescent-adorned stars and rocks to kill all but the officer. A helicopter appears to reinforce the Israelis, which the woman also easily destroys throwing a sheld with the form of Palestine. The dance choreographer watches helplessly and the woman disappears.

The film ends with E.S. and his mother watching their dinner cook in a pressure cooker.

==Oscar controversy==
Despite being nominated for the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; award at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, the film&#x27;s consideration as candidate for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards was an occasion for considerable controversy. In late 2002, producer Humbert Balsan authorized the US distributor of the film to release a statement which stated that Balsan had asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences if the film could run for best foreign language picture. According to Balsan, the answer was no, because &quot;Palestine is not a state we recognize in our rules.&quot; However, spokesperson John Pavlik states that the Academy had never made a decision on that issue because Suleiman had never submitted his film. Critics like &quot;The Electronic Intifada&quot; and others, claim that the Academy did make a decision, and that it was based on political considerations.

The film was considered for an Oscar the following year; Pavlik told &quot;Variety&quot; &quot;The committee decided to treat Palestine as an exception in the same way we treat Hong Kong as an exception. It&#x27;s always the goal of the foreign-language film award executive committee to be as inclusive as possible.&quot;

==Music==
Elia Suleiman has used entirely non-original music of various genres and artists in the film. These include artists such as the Belgian singer Natacha Atlas, Indian composer A.R. Rahman, Lebanese electro-pop band Soapkills and Paris-based record producer Mirwais Ahmadza√Ø.

<doc id="614829" wikidata="Q1798108" url="?curid=614829" title="Parry Sound District">
<text>Parry Sound District is a census division of the Canadian province of Ontario. Its boundaries are District of Muskoka to the south, the Sudbury District to the north-northwest, the French River and Lake Nipissing in the north, Nipissing District and North Bay in the north and east and parts of Algonquin Park in the northeast.

It is geographically in Southern Ontario, but the Ontario and federal governments administer it as part of Northern Ontario. Like other census divisions in Northern Ontario, it does not have an incorporated county, regional municipality, or district municipality level of government but instead serves as a purely territorial division, like the other districts of Northern Ontario. Instead of an upper tier of municipal administration, all government services in the district are provided by the local municipalities or by the provincial government itself.

Some communities that are not part of any incorporated municipality are served by local services boards. The district is also included in the service areas of FedNor and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund. Accordingly, in most administrative contexts, the division is grouped with the Northern Ontario region instead of Southern Ontario, which is mainly geographic.

Along with the neighbouring Muskoka and Haliburton regions, the Parry Sound District is considered part of Ontario&#x27;s cottage country, which is geographically in the primary region of Southern Ontario and the secondary region of Central Ontario. The district is commonly divided into two subregions, West Parry Sound and East Parry Sound, the latter of which is often referred to as the Almaguin Highlands.

==Original geographic townships==
==History==
The district falls under the Robinson-Huron Treaty in 1850. The Anishinaabeg/Anishinaabek - Ojibway, Odawa, and Potawatomi communities reside in the District of Parry Sound, which also encompasses the lands of the Wasauksing, Shawanaga, Magnetawan, Dokis, and Henvey Inlet First Nations.

During the early part of the 20th century, the area was a popular subject for the many scenic artworks of Tom Thomson and members of the Group of Seven.

===Forest fire protection history===

The Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario&#x27;s former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario&#x27;s forests from fire by early detection from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed in the town of Parry Sound. It was the central location for 21 fire tower lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. The other 20 towers in the district were: Pickerel River CPR, Byng Inlet, Still River, Pointe au Baril, Pakesley, Pickerel River CNR, Key Junction, Ardbeg, Spence, Go Home, Loring, Stormy Lake (Restoule), Nipissing, Boulter, Lount, Laurier, Strong, Proudfoot, Stisted and Draper. When a fire was spotted in the forest a tower man would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more tower men from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a &#x27;triangulation&#x27; read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. In 1969 there remained only 4 actively staffed towers: Ardbeg, Go Home, Stormy Lake, and Boulter. These would all be phased out shortly after when aerial firefighting techniques were employed in the 1970s.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Parry Sound District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="614836" wikidata="Q7307172" url="?curid=614836" title="Referendums in the United Kingdom">
<text>Referendums in the United Kingdom are occasionally held at a national, regional or local level. Historically, national referendums are rare due to the long-standing principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Legally there is no constitutional requirement to hold a national referendum for any purpose or on any issue. However, the UK Parliament is free to legislate through an Act of Parliament for a referendum to be held on any question at any time.

National referendums are regulated by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which also regulates for regional and local referendums in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. In Scotland referendums on devolved matters are regulated under the Referendums (Scotland) Act 2020.

Only three national referendums have ever been held across the whole of the United Kingdom, the first, in 1975, on the issue of continued membership of the European Communities (EC), resulted in the UK remaining members of the organisations that were known as the Common Market and became the European Union. The second, in 2011, was on the proposed change of the voting system for parliament to alternative voting, which was rejected. The first international referendum was the 2016 European Union membership referendum, in which Gibraltar also took part.

The Government of the United Kingdom has also to date held ten major referendums within the constituent countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on issues of devolution, sovereignty and independence; the first such referendum was the 1973 Northern Ireland border poll and, as of 2023, the most recent is the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The Scottish Government asked to hold a second Scottish independence referendum in October 2023, but this was rejected by the UK government, and the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish parliament could not hold an independence referendum unilaterally.

There have also been numerous referendums held by local authorities on issues such as temperance and directly elected mayors.

==Status of referendums==
Major referendums have been rare in the UK, and have only been held on major constitutional issues. Historically, referendums within the United Kingdom were opposed on the supposition that they violate the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. In May 1945 the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested holding a referendum over the question of extending the life of his wartime Coalition until victory was won over Japan. However, Deputy Prime Minister Clement Attlee refused, saying &quot;I could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum, which has only too often been the instrument of Nazism and Fascism.&quot; In March 1975 Margaret Thatcher also quoted Clement Attlee that referendums are &quot;a device of dictators and demagogues&quot; as Napoleon, Mussolini and Hitler had exploited their use in the past.

There are two types of referendum that have been held by the UK Government, pre-legislative (held before proposed legislation is passed) and post-legislative (held after legislation is passed). Of the three UK-wide referendums to date, the 1975 referendum was post-legislative as the UK had joined the European Communities (EC) in 1973, whereas the 2011 and 2016 referendums were both pre-legislative. Referendums are not binding, so the Government is not required to follow up with any action afterwards; for example, even if the result of a pre-legislative referendum were a &quot;majority&quot; of &quot;No&quot; for a proposed law, Parliament could pass it anyway.

For any UK-wide referendum to be held legislation has to be passed by the UK Parliament for each vote to take place, as there is no pre-determined format or voting franchise for any such vote. There is no requirement for the UK Government to take any official position in any such vote. For example, in 1975 under the then Prime Minister Harold Wilson the Government formally recommended a &quot;Yes&quot; vote to staying in the European Community and in 2016 the Government formally recommended a &quot;Remain&quot; vote to stay in the European Union (a decision which indirectly led to the resignation of David Cameron as Prime Minister following the advice to &quot;Leave the European Union&quot; by the British electorate). In the 2011 referendum no official position was taken as the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was split on the issue.

Parliament could, at any point in the future, reverse legislation approved by referendum as the concept of parliamentary sovereignty means no Parliament can prevent a future Parliament from amending or repealing legislation.

Finally, under the Local Government Act 1972, there is a provision under which non-binding local referendums on any issue can be called by small groups of voters. This power exists only for parish councils, and not larger authorities, and is commonly known as the &quot;Parish Poll&quot;. Six local voters may call a meeting, and if ten voters or a third of the meeting (whichever is smaller) agree, the council must carry out a referendum in 14‚Äì25 days. The referendum is merely advisory, but if there is a substantial majority and the results are well-publicised, it may be influential.

== Organisation and legislation ==
There was no independent public body to regulate referendums within the United Kingdom until the Labour government led by Tony Blair in 2000 set out a framework for the running of all future referendums when the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 or PPERA was passed, creating and giving the Electoral Commission responsibility for running all elections and such future referendums. The act also permitted the appointment of a &quot;chief counting officer&quot; (CCO) to oversee all future UK-wide referendums which would be held by the chairperson of the Electoral Commission.

=== Legislation ===
Separate legislation (i.e. an Act of Parliament) by the Parliament of the United Kingdom is required for the holding of each UK-wide referendum which is held to set out the referendum question, its format, the franchise for each plebiscite, and how each count is to be conducted. To date three pieces of primary legislation has been passed by the UK Parliament to enable the holding of the following UK-wide referendums.

*Referendum Act 1975 (United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975)
*Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011)
*European Union Referendum Act 2015 (United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016)

====1997 Devolution Referendums Legislation====
In the summer of 1997 the UK Parliament passed the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act to enable the holding of two pre-legislative referendums on devolution in both Scotland and Wales on the establishment of a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly.

==Devolution, sovereignty, and independence referendums==
The Government of the United Kingdom has held ten major referendums within the constituent countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on issues of devolution, sovereignty and independence; the first such referendum was the 1973 Northern Ireland border poll

The Labour Government of 1997‚Äì2010 held five referendums on devolution, four of which received a yes majority. 

Since the Government of Wales Act 2006 became law, there can be referendums in Wales asking the people whether the National Assembly for Wales should be given greater law-making powers. The Welsh Labour Party - Plaid Cymru Coalition Government in the Welsh Assembly held such a referendum in 2011, resulting in a yes vote.

The Scottish Government held a referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September 2014. It attracted a turnout of 84.59%, the highest for any referendum held in the UK. The majority (55.3%) voted against Scotland being an independent country. In March 2017 the Scottish Parliament authorised the Scottish Government to seek to hold a proposed second Scottish independence referendum, but it was struck down by the UK Supreme Court in November 2022.

Wales&#x27; pro-independence party, Plaid Cymru, have been calling for a independence referendum in Wales, as part of its 2021 Senedd election manifesto.

==National referendums==
To date only three referendums have been held which have covered the whole of the United Kingdom. The following is a description of each of the three national referendums.

=== 1975 European Communities membership referendum ===
On Thursday 5 June 1975 the United Kingdom held its first-ever nationwide referendum on whether to continue its membership of the European Communities (EC) principally the European Economic Community (EEC, or &quot;Common Market&quot;) as it was more widely known at the time. The UK had been a member of the EC since 1 January 1973 and the vote came about after a manifesto commitment by the Labour Party under the then Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the UK General Election in October 1974 and following a renegotiation of EC membership. All of the major political parties and mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. However, there were significant splits within the ruling Labour party, the membership of which had voted 2:1 in favour of withdrawal at a one-day party conference on 26 April 1975. Since the cabinet was split between strongly pro-European and strongly anti-European ministers, Harold Wilson suspended the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility and allowed ministers to publicly campaign on either side. Seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EC membership and the party was formally neutral on the issue. The referendum was conducted in its entirety under the provisions of the Referendum Act 1975 as there was no procedure, prior legislation or official public body at the time to oversee the holding of any such plebiscite. The two campaign groups in the referendum were &quot;Britain in Europe&quot; advocating a yes vote and &quot;National Referendum Campaign&quot; advocating a no vote.

The voters were asked to vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; on the question: &quot;Do you think the United Kingdom should stay in the European Community (the Common Market)?&quot; In line with the outcome of the vote, the government took no further action and the United Kingdom remained a member of the European Communities which would later become the European Union.


===2011 Alternative Vote referendum===
The alternative vote referendum, as part of the Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition agreement drawn up following the 2010 general election, was a nationwide vote held on Thursday 5 May 2011 (the same date as local elections in many areas) to choose the method of electing MPs at subsequent general elections. The referendum concerned whether to replace the present &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system with the &quot;alternative vote&quot; (AV) method. The voters were asked to vote yes or no on the question &quot;At present, the UK uses the &quot;first past the post&quot; system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. Should the &quot;alternative vote&quot; system be used instead?&quot;. It was the first nationwide referendum to be held for some thirty six years and was legislated for under the provisions of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and is to date the first and only UK-wide referendum to be held on a domestic issue. Turnout was low at just 42% nationally and was also marked by relatively low key campaigning. The two campaigning groups for the referendum was advocating a yes vote YES! To Fairer Votes and advocating a no vote NOtoAV.

AV was rejected by 67% of voters with all but ten of the 440 voting areas voted &quot;No&quot; and the proposed legislation to introduce AV which was subject to the referendum was repealed.


===2016 European Union membership referendum===
On Thursday 23 June 2016 the United Kingdom voted for the second time in 41 years on its membership to what is now known as the European Union (EU) with the overseas territory Gibraltar also voting on the issue for the very first time. The referendum was called after Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron made a manifesto commitment in the 2015 United Kingdom general election to undertake a renegotiation of the UK&#x27;s membership to the European Union which would be followed by a in-out referendum. All of the major political parties were in favour of remaining an EU member, except for a split within the Conservative Party. The cabinet was split between pro-EU and anti-EU ministers, and Cameron suspended the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility, allowing ministers to publicly campaign on either side. Seven of the 23 members of the Cabinet opposed continued EU membership.

The referendum was legislated for under the provisions of the European Union Referendum Act 2015, which legally required the UK Government to hold the referendum no later than 31 December 2017 and also the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Voters were asked to vote &quot;Remain a member of the European Union&quot; or &quot;Leave the European Union&quot; on the question &quot;Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?&quot; The lead campaign group for the referendum that was advocating the &quot;remain&quot; vote was Britain Stronger in Europe, and advocating the &quot;leave&quot; vote was Vote Leave.

The &quot;Leave&quot; option was chosen by 52% of voters, with 48% of voters opting to &quot;Remain&quot;. Of the 382 voting areas, 263 areas returned &quot;majority&quot; votes in favour of &quot;Leave&quot; whereas 119 areas returned &quot;majority&quot; votes in favour of &quot;Remain&quot; which included every Scottish council area and all but five of the London boroughs. The vote revealed divisions among the constituent nations of the United Kingdom, with England and Wales voting to leave, but Scotland and Northern Ireland voting to remain. The national turnout was 72% which was eight percentage points higher than the turnout in 1975, although the majority was 12 percentage points lower. It was the first time a UK-wide referendum result had gone against the preferred choice of the UK Government, which had officially recommended a &quot;Remain&quot; vote, and it led to a period of political turmoil. As a direct consequence of losing the referendum, David Cameron announced his resignation as Prime Minister on the morning after the vote. He left office three weeks later on 13 July, and was succeeded by Theresa May who later resigned in 2019 due to the issue remaining unresolved. Following the vote there was frequent public discussion as to whether the result of the referendum was advisory or mandatory, but the High Court stated on 3 November 2016 that, in the absence of specific provision in the enabling legislation (and in this case there was none), &quot;a referendum on any topic can only be advisory for the lawmakers in Parliament&quot;.

==List of other major referendums==
Since 1973 there have been ten other referendums held by the UK Government within the constituent countries related to the issues of sovereignty, devolution and independence in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and in parts of England (in the North East and London).

===England===
*1998 Greater London Authority referendum, on whether there should be a Greater London Authority, consisting of a Mayor of London and a London Assembly (yes)
*2004 North East England devolution referendum, on an elected regional assembly (no)

===Northern Ireland===
*1973 Northern Ireland border poll, on whether Northern Ireland should leave the United Kingdom and join the Republic of Ireland (no) The referendum was boycotted by nationalists.
*1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum, on the Good Friday Agreement (yes)

===Scotland===
*1979 Scottish devolution referendum, on whether there should be a Scottish Assembly (small majority voted yes, but fell short of the 40% threshold required to enact devolution)
*1997 Scottish devolution referendum, Two questions: On whether there should be a Scottish Parliament (yes); On whether a Scottish Parliament should have tax varying powers (yes)
*2014 Scottish independence referendum on the question &quot;Should Scotland be an independent country?&quot;, 18 September 2014 (no)

===Wales===
*1979 Welsh devolution referendum, on whether there should be a Welsh Assembly (no)
*1997 Welsh devolution referendum, on whether there should be a National Assembly for Wales (yes)
*2011 Welsh devolution referendum, on whether the National Assembly should have increased law-making powers (yes)

==Local referendums==

Referendums have been held in local areas in England, Wales and Scotland since the 1850s. These have covered issues such as local government administration, transport, prohibition, libraries, and other local questions. The areas covered have generally corresponded to local authority areas, civil parishes, or wards, with all local government electors of the relevant area being eligible to vote.

=== Advisory referendums ===
Principal authorities in Great Britain have the ability to hold an advisory referendum on any issue relating to its services, financial provisions, and other matters that are relevant to the area. The power for principal local authorities to hold a poll within England and Wales is specifically granted by the Local Government Act 2003; previously local polls relied upon a council&#x27;s power to consult residents and collect information. In Scotland the power is similarly implied by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and an additional power is conferred by the requirement of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 to consult before introducing a road charging scheme. The power to hold local referendums has not been extended to Northern Ireland.

A local advisory referendum is not required to follow the legislation governing the conduct of other referendums and elections in the UK. The local authority can choose how to conduct a local referendum, and may choose to hold the vote solely by post, instead of using polling stations.

====Transport referendums====

The City of Edinburgh Council held a postal-ballot referendum in February 2005 over whether voters supported the Council&#x27;s proposed transport strategy. These plans included a congestion charge which would have required motorists to pay a fee to enter the city at certain times of the day. The result was announced on 22 February 2005 and the people of Edinburgh had rejected the proposals. 74% voted against, 26% voted in favour, and the turnout was 62%.

==== Strathclyde water referendum ====
Strathclyde Regional Council held a referendum in 1994 on the plans of the Conservative UK government to privatise water services within Scotland. The government planned to sell the three recently established water authorities in Scotland, created under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 as a precursor for privatisation, which would bring Scotland in line with the 1989 privatisation in England and Wales. Strathclyde council, which previously held responsibility for water services, planned the referendum in response to overwhelming public opinion against the move. The referendum, conducted by post, resulted in 97% voting against the plan, with 70% of the electorate participating. Although the referendum had no legal effect, the plan to privatise Scottish water services was eventually dropped.

=== Statutory referendums ===
Legislation in England and Wales obliges local authorities to hold and abide by the results of referendums in certain circumstances.

In England, raising Council Tax above a level proscribed by the Local Government Secretary requires approval in a referendum. The threshold was initially set at 2% in 2012 for all types of local authority, but for authorities that fund social care the threshold was increased to 4% in 2015 and 5% in 2017. From April 2018 the figures for both types of authority have been increased by an additional 1%. This provision applies to all precepting authorities, when this is not the billing authority (i.e. the district council), the latter will hold the referendum on the precepting authority&#x27;s behalf, and recoup the costs. Only one council tax referendum has been held, on behalf of the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner, and the rise was rejected. A proposal for a referendum to increase the council tax for Surrey County Council by 15% was initially approved by the council, but plans for the increase were abandoned before the referendum could go ahead.

The Localism Act 2011 allows parish councils or local community groups to create neighbourhood development plans. The plans are intended to guide planning decisions within the neighbourhood area, by outlining the amount and type of development that should occur in the area, what land may be built upon and how existing buildings may be reused. For a plan to come into force, it must be approved by the electorate in the local area in a referendum. Neighbourhood planning referendums have a high success rate, with all being approved as of December 2015.

====Mayoral and other governance referendums====
A local authority in England and Wales can hold a referendum on changing its executive arrangements between a directly elected mayor, a leader and cabinet, and in England only, a committee system. A referendum can be held by three methods; by a resolution of the council to hold one, under an order from the government, or upon receiving a petition signed by five per cent of registered voters within the local authority area, in the only example of the initiative process in the United Kingdom. If successful, the council must change its governance system, and hold an election for the mayor if necessary.

The process differs between England and Wales. In England, a referendum can be held on moving between any of the three systems, and following the vote another referendum may not be held for 10 years. A council is not required to hold a referendum to change its executive arrangements, but a change that has occurred as a result of a referendum can only be changed following another referendum. In Wales, a council must hold a referendum to change between a mayor and leader and cabinet, with the minimum period between votes set at five years.

Fifty-three referendums have taken place in local authorities to establish whether there is support for directly elected mayors. Sixteen were successful and a mayoralty was established; in thirty-seven local authorities an elected mayor was rejected by voters. An additional six referendums have been held on removing the post of elected mayor, with three mayoralties being retained, and three disestablished. Ten referendums were held in 2012 as part of the government&#x27;s manifesto to introduce elected mayors in the largest cities in England without the position. Only one new mayoralty was approved, and no further votes have been ordered by the government. Two referendums have been held in response to a petition on moving to a committee system, in the Borough of Fylde and in West Dorset. Both referendums were successful. On average, turnout is similar to that of local elections, with the highest turnout 64% in Berwick-upon-Tweed (held alongside the 2001 general election) and the lowest 10% in the London Borough of Ealing.

====Prohibition referendums====
The temperance movement led to two countries of the UK gaining the right to hold referendums on the sale of alcohol in the local area, upon the request of a number of local electors.

The Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913 provided that polls could be held in small local areas in Scotland to determine whether to instate a level of prohibition on the purchase of alcoholic beverages; the provisions were later incorporated into the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1959. Between 1913 and 1965 1,131 such polls were held, with the vast majority (1,079) held before 1930. These provisions and the local polls were abolished by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976.

The Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 mandated that all public houses in Wales be closed on Sundays. The Act was extended to Monmouthshire in 1921. Under the terms of the Licensing Act 1961, on the application of 500 local electors, a referendum could be held in each local government area at seven-year intervals on whether that district should be &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot; on the Sabbath. Most districts in the border area and the southern industrial area went &quot;wet&quot; in 1961 or 1968, with most others following suit in 1975. In 1982, the last district, Dwyfor, in western Gwynedd, went &quot;wet&quot; and it was thought that the influence of the Sabbatarian temperance movement had expired and few referendums were called, but surprisingly a further referendum was called in Dwyfor in 1989 and the area went &quot;dry&quot; for another seven years on a 9% turnout. The whole of Wales was &quot;wet&quot; from 1996, and the facility for further referendums was removed by the Sunday Licensing Act 2003.

===Parish polls===

A parish poll is a referendum held in a civic parish under the Local Government Act 1972. The cost of holding such polls is met by the parish council.

The act states: &quot;A poll may be demanded before the conclusion of a community meeting on any question arising at the meeting; but no poll shall be taken unless either the person presiding at the meeting consents or the poll is demanded by not less than ten, or one-third, of the local government electors present at the meeting, whichever is the less.&quot;

In September 2007, villagers in East Stoke in Dorset forced a referendum, under the Local Government Act 1972, on this question: &quot;Do You Want a Referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty? Yes or No?&quot; Of the 339 people who were eligible to vote, 80 voted: 72 votes for Yes and 8 votes for No. The poll was initiated by a supporter of the UK Independence Party, a political party noted for its Euroscepticism. The poll was criticised by the chairman of the parish council as &quot;little more than a publicity stunt.&quot;

<text>In geometry, a hendecagon (also undecagon or endecagon) or 11-gon is an eleven-sided polygon. (The name &quot;hendecagon&quot;, from Greek &quot;hendeka&quot; &quot;eleven&quot; and &quot;‚Äìgon&quot; &quot;corner&quot;, is often preferred to the hybrid &quot;undecagon&quot;, whose first part is formed from Latin &quot;undecim&quot; &quot;eleven&quot;.)

==Regular hendecagon==

A &quot;regular hendecagon&quot; is represented by Schl√§fli symbol {11}.

A regular hendecagon has internal angles of 147.27 degrees (=147 formula_1 degrees). The area of a regular hendecagon with side length &quot;a&quot; is given by
:formula_2

As 11 is not a Fermat prime, the regular hendecagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge. Because 11 is not a Pierpont prime, construction of a regular hendecagon is still impossible even with the usage of an angle trisector. 

Close approximations to the regular hendecagon can be constructed. For instance, the ancient Greek mathematicians approximated the side length of a hendecagon inscribed in a unit circle as being 14/25 units long.

The hendecagon can be constructed exactly via neusis construction and also via two-fold origami.

==Approximate construction==

The following construction description is given by T. Drummond from 1800:

On a unit circle:
* Constructed hendecagon side length formula_3
* Theoretical hendecagon side length formula_4
* Absolute error formula_5 ‚Äì if is 10¬†m then this error is approximately 2.3¬†mm.

== Symmetry==
The &quot;regular hendecagon&quot; has Dih11 symmetry, order 22. Since 11 is a prime number there is one subgroup with dihedral symmetry: Dih1, and 2 cyclic group symmetries: Z11, and Z1.

These 4 symmetries can be seen in 4 distinct symmetries on the hendecagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r22 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g11 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

==Use in coinage==
The Canadian dollar coin, the loonie, is similar to, but not exactly, a regular hendecagonal prism, as are the Indian 2-rupee coin and several other lesser-used coins of other nations. The cross-section of a loonie is actually a Reuleaux hendecagon. The United States Susan B. Anthony dollar has a hendecagonal outline along the inside of its edges.

==Related figures==
The hendecagon shares the same set of 11 vertices with four regular hendecagrams:

<text>The Original Ninfa&#x27;s on Navigation is a popular Mexican restaurant located at 2704 Navigation Boulevard in Houston, Texas. The restaurant serves both Tex-Mex and Mexican cuisine. The Original Ninfa&#x27;s was started by Ninfa Rodr√≠guez Laurenzo, a Mexican-American woman, in a tortilla factory. Ninfa Laurenzo became a full-time restaurateur and the tortilla factory closed. Mama Ninfa is widely credited with popularizing the fajita among Houstonians.

Dai Huynh of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that the Ninfa&#x27;s locations opened after the first two restaurants &quot;failed to attract the following of earlier restaurants.&quot; Tom Laurenzo said that the Laurenzo family never became very wealthy while it controlled the Ninfa&#x27;s restaurants. He said &quot;Everything was put back into the business.&quot; When the Laurenzo family controlled the restaurant chain, it was managed by Ninfa&#x27;s Inc., which became a subsidiary of the Laurenzo-controlled holding company RioStar Corp.

==History==

===1970s===
In 1973, Ninfa Laurenzo, a widow with five children, established Ninfa&#x27;s, then a taco stand, as a side business due to financial troubles with her original core business, a tortilla factory. Laurenzo&#x27;s factory was losing money, and she needed to update her equipment in order to comply with new regulations. When Laurenzo decided to establish a restaurant, she applied for loans at several banks. The banks turned her down, so a friend in Mexico City loaned her several thousand dollars. Laurenzo divided the factory facility in half. The back of the factory continued to act as a tortilla factory, while the front had ten tables and 40 chairs. Laurenzo used discarded second hand furniture and pots and pans from her kitchen in the restaurant. The Ninfa&#x27;s restaurant opened in July of that year. The cuisine at Ninfa&#x27;s differed from the cuisine of Tex Mex restaurants at the time. The restaurant almost closed after a fire struck one week after its initial opening. Dai Huynh of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said &quot;Word quickly spread about the East End restaurant with good, cheap food and an outgoing Mexican Mama who greeted diners with open arms.&quot;

Laurenzo tripled the space of the original Ninfa&#x27;s and closed the tortilla-making operations. The restaurant became a family-owned corporation. Around 1976 the restaurant was becoming popular among many groups of people, including employees in Downtown Houston, area politicians, and other groups. Ninfa&#x27;s became so popular that, in 1975, she opened a second location on Westheimer Road, one that was larger than the original. In 1977 Richard West of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said &quot;no other Texas restaurant dictates the dining-out habits of so many of its city&#x27;s inhabitants&quot; and that the restaurant is &quot;a favorite topic of conversation among Mexican food fanciers not just in Houston but all over the state.&quot;

Around June 1977 the original Ninfa&#x27;s on Navigation averaged 400 customers daily for lunch and 700 daily for dinner. During the same time the Ninfa&#x27;s on Westheimer averaged 600 customers daily for lunch and 1,000 daily for dinner. The averages remained constant for all seven days of the week. In 1978 the restaurant chain had 500 employees, including 60 workers in the kitchens. Among the employees were members of Laurenzo&#x27;s family. Laurenzo&#x27;s five children, including four sons and one daughter, managed aspects of the Ninfa&#x27;s business. Phyllis Mandola worked as the manager of the catering division. Jack Laurenzo, one son, and Ninfa Laurenzo held weekly cooking classes. Pilar Di Meo, Laurenzo&#x27;s twin sister, worked in the restaurant&#x27;s main office. Di Meo&#x27;s son, Steve, worked as a personnel manager.

Workers and municipal employees who had discovered restaurant chain took family members there. Throughout the restaurant&#x27;s history, many celebrities, including Aerosmith, George H. W. Bush, George Benson, Dyan Cannon, Michael Douglas, Crystal Gayle, Rock Hudson, Reba McEntire, John Travolta, Ben Vereen, and ZZ Top ate at Ninfa&#x27;s. Travolta had a private corner at the Westheimer Ninfa&#x27;s location while he filmed &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, and while flying in his private aircraft he often stopped in Houston to pick up Ninfa&#x27;s food. Bill Schadewald of the &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; said that eating at Ninfa&#x27;s became an integral routine of tourists in the Houston area.

===1980s===
In 1980 Ninfa&#x27;s had seven restaurants. Roland Laurenzo, the head of Ninfa&#x27;s parent company, decided to expand the number of locations. In 1980 and 1981 Ninfa&#x27;s opened four restaurants in Dallas. In 1981 the chain grossed $30 million. In 1982 the chain had 13 restaurants. Because of problems with the business, Ninfa&#x27;s ultimately had to close three of the four new Dallas locations. At later points in the 1980s Ninfa&#x27;s closed another Dallas location and a San Antonio location. Greg Hassel of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that expanding Ninfa&#x27;s &quot;has not always been easy.&quot;

In the early 1980s there were nine Ninfa&#x27;s. The profits from the original two restaurants were used to open the other seven. By 1983 Ninfa&#x27;s became the largest Hispanic-owned business in Houston. In 1987 there were nine Ninfa&#x27;s locations in Greater Houston. In September 1987 the chain celebrated its tenth anniversary of the Westheimer restaurant, with a weeklong schedule of festivities.

====McFaddin Ventures====
In 1985 Ninfa&#x27;s established a joint venture with McFaddin Ventures, a nightclub operator, in order to reduce the family&#x27;s risks in opening new restaurants. At the time opening a new restaurant would have a cost of $1.5 million. In October of that year McFaddin paid Ninfa&#x27;s $635,000 for the rights of the future use of the Ninfa&#x27;s name, and Roland Laurenzo and another Ninfa&#x27;s executive joined McFaddin; these actions began the joint venture. Roland became the senior vice president of the McFaddin restaurant group. McFaddin was required to pay a quarterly fee to Ninfa&#x27;s based on the restaurant chain&#x27;s sales. As part of the agreement, McFaddin was to open 12 Ninfa&#x27;s locations by April 25, 1989. After the opening of the tenth restaurant, it was supposed to continually operate ten of the restaurants for a five-year period.

Less than nine months after the agreement was signed, Roland Laurenzo and six other McFaddin employees were terminated, and McFaddin sued Ninfa&#x27;s and the Laurenzo family. In its suit, McFaddin said that Ninfa&#x27;s and the Laurenzo family had threatened to picket the McFaddin restaurant and disrupt McFaddin restaurants, defamed McFaddin, and asked McFaddin employees to disrupt operations at the McFaddin restaurants. Ninfa&#x27;s counter-sued McFaddin in the fall of 1986, saying that McFaddin changed the name of the Bandera division, an Austin, Texas-based home delivery Mexican food stores that opened and closed in 1986, in order to deprive Ninfa&#x27;s of revenues. After civil action from both sides occurred, the parties agreed to a settlement.

===1990s===
In 1993 Ninfa&#x27;s had 43 restaurants in Texas and Louisiana. In a one-year period ending on October 16, 1996, Ninfa&#x27;s embarked on an expansion program, opening six new restaurants, with new locations in four Texas cities: El Paso, Killeen, Tyler, and Waco, Shreveport, Louisiana, and Leipzig, Germany. The new locations required large amounts of capital, and RioStar bought equipment, paper goods, and supplies from the company Sysco. This caused the company to accumulate a lot of debt quickly. When the chain expanded outside of Texas, people unfamiliar with the name did not understand what &quot;Ninfa&quot; meant, so the chain named restaurants outside of Greater Houston and Greater Dallas &quot;Mama Ninfa&#x27;s Mexican Restaurants.&quot; In October 1996 the chain had 40 restaurants, including 36 in Texas, three in Louisiana, and one in Downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Its Shreveport, Louisiana location had opened in October 1996.

====Germany restaurant====
One individual, a Houston businessperson named Eckart Wieske, opened a 250-seat licensed Ninfa&#x27;s restaurant in Leipzig, Germany. Due to higher than expected costs, Wieske was unable to cover his debts, and on October 16, 1996, the bank that lent him money took control of the restaurant. The Ninfa&#x27;s in Leipzig remained open after the bank had taken possession of it.

====Bankruptcy protection and settlement====

In October 1996, Sysco filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against RioStar in an attempt to force the company to pay $2.8 million ($ in today&#x27;s money) in debts accumulated from the company&#x27;s expansion. RioStar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In 1998 Serrano&#x27;s Cafe, an Austin, Texas-based company, acquired RioStar as part of the bankruptcy protection settlement. The family was no longer involved in Ninfa&#x27;s.

===2000s and present===

Ninfa Laurenzo, the restaurant&#x27;s founder, died of bone cancer at the age of 77, on Sunday June 17, 2001.

In 2001 there were 55 Ninfa&#x27;s locations controlled by Serrano&#x27;s. The restaurants in Georgia and Louisiana were independent franchises. In 2005 Ninfa&#x27;s continued to have locations in Texas, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Shreveport, Louisiana, and Georgia.

In 2006, Niel Morgan, the owner of the Antone&#x27;s po boy chain, started the new firm Legacy Restaurants, then proceeded to make a deal with Serrano&#x27;s. Morgan acquired the rights to the original Ninfa&#x27;s and took direct control, while Serrano&#x27;s began to license the Ninfa&#x27;s name for eight other locations. After Morgan took control of the original restaurants, he proceeded to begin renovations, which added potted plants and a colonial Spanish-style bench. As part of Morgan&#x27;s overhaul, a VIP parking service was added. Morgan also had the restrooms upgraded and added an outdoor deck and a parking lot.

The Original Ninfa&#x27;s on Navigation has been owned and operated by Legacy Restaurants since mid-2006. The Executive Chef is Alex Padilla whose mother worked for Laurenzo when he was growing up in Houston. Legacy has made a number of improvements including a lighted parking lot and covered outdoor seating.

There are still &quot;Ninfa&#x27;s Mexican Restaurants&quot; in Houston and elsewhere operated by independent owners who previously received licenses to use the name from the Laurenzo family. None of these are affiliated with the Original Ninfa&#x27;s on Navigation. In 2008, there were 14 independently licensed Ninfa&#x27;s locations.

In 2012, several licensed Ninfa&#x27;s locations were converted into &quot;Maggie Rita&#x27;s Tex-Mex Grill &amp; Bar,&quot; a restaurant chain co-owned by Carlos Mencia. Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; rated the food at the new restaurants negatively and said that &quot;[i]t represents a new nadir for a once-respected and beloved Houston Tex-Mex institution.&quot; Shilcutt further added that the takeover caused an &quot;uproar&quot; in Houston and that &quot;but to many longtime Houstonians (me included), the deal with interloper Maggie Rita&#x27;s may as well have been a pact with the devil.&quot;

In 2012 Shilcutt said that overall, &quot;Ninfa&#x27;s hadn&#x27;t been that great in a long time&quot;. She explained that the original location was &quot;still reflective of the restaurant chain when it was in its prime,&quot; while the other locations &quot;have varying levels of food and service, although most have fallen away significantly from the high-quality cuisine offered at the Original and last of the true Ninfa&#x27;s empire.&quot;

In November 2013 an enclosed patio opened at the original Ninfa&#x27;s.

In 2017, the original Ninfa&#x27;s was featured on a Houston-based episode of the Travel Channel show &quot;Man v. Food&quot;, hosted by Casey Webb.

The owners of the original Ninfa&#x27;s plan to open another branch at BLVD Place in Uptown Houston in 2019.

==Cuisine==

Ninfa&#x27;s historically specialized in Tex-Mex and &quot;Norte√±o&quot; style Mexican dishes. Ninfa Laurenzo drew inspiration from the cooking of her mother, who was a Mexican, and from Laurenzo&#x27;s own travels to Mexico City. The food had an Italian influence because Laurenzo&#x27;s deceased husband, Domenic Thomas Laurenzo, was an Italian American. Mozzarella, olive oil, and parmesan were used as ingredients.

The signature dish was &quot;tacos al carbon,&quot; which later became called &quot;fajitas.&quot; The Ninfa&#x27;s fajitas included chopped, char-grilled beef fillets placed in handmade flour tortillas. Ninfa&#x27;s used a smoky marinade in the beef fajitas. The restaurant popularized fajitas in the Houston area. This dish was so influential that, by 2001, just about all Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston served a version of the Ninfa&#x27;s fajitas.

The second most popular dish was the &quot;Green Sauce,&quot; an avocado and tomatillo sauce. When a customer had asked for &quot;salsa verde,&quot; Ninfa Laurenzo created the &quot;Green Sauce&quot; at the spur of the moment. Ninfa Laurenzo&#x27;s son Roland later offered a modified version of this dish at his own restaurant, using pureed avocados, tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and jalape√±os. Patricia Sharpe of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said that Roland&#x27;s version was a &quot;creamier, more luxurious potion&quot; than his mother&#x27;s original recipe. Ninfa&#x27;s also offered stuffed jalape√±os. The stuffed jalape√±os became a menu item at Tony Mandola&#x27;s Gulf Coast Kitchen, operated by Phyllis Laurenzo Mandola, one of Ninfa Laurenzo&#x27;s daughters, and her husband Tony.

In 2004 Sharpe said that, at the original Ninfa&#x27;s, the beef fajitas &quot;still have their old magic&quot; and that the flour tortillas, still made to order in-house, &quot;are truly carb-addictive.&quot; She said that the chicken fajitas &quot;have lost their luster.&quot; After Neil Morgan took over the chain in 2006, chef Alex Padilla added some new menu items including crab cakes with poblano sauce and Spanish lobster in tequila butter sauce. Padilla also said that the restaurant would grind its own beef brisket for its crispy tacos and use fresh tomatillo in the green sauce.

The original Ninfa&#x27;s includes several torta sandwiches, including the fajita burger, which consistently is positively reviewed. By July 2012 the restaurant introduced three new tortas, Al Pastor, Chicken Adobo, and Puerca (Pork).

<text>Sichuan University (SCU) is a public university in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. The university is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

In 1994, the then Chengdu University of Science and Technology and then Sichuan University merged to form Sichuan Union University (which was renamed Sichuan University in 1998). In 2000, the then West China University of Medical Sciences and then Sichuan University merged to establish the current form of Sichuan University.

== History ==

Sichuan University is one of the earliest institutions of higher education in China. Its earliest predecessor was the Sichuan Chinese and Western School (ÂõõÂ∑ù‰∏≠Ë•øÂ≠∏Â†Ç), a school established in 1896 that combined traditional and modern methods of education. In 1902, it was merged with two traditional Chinese academies, the Jinjiang Shuyuan (Èå¶Ê±üÊõ∏Èô¢, founded 1740) and the Zunjing Shuyuan (Â∞äÁ∂ìÊõ∏Èô¢, founded 1875), and became known as the Sichuan Higher School (ÂõõÂ∑ùÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠¶Â†Ç, later ÂõõÂ∑ùÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠¶Ê†°). In 1916, after another merger with a normal school, it was renamed the National Chengdu Higher Normal School (ÂúãÁ´ãÊàêÈÉΩÈ´òÁ≠âÂ∏´ÁØÑÂ≠∏Ê†°). In the late 1920s, the institution was briefly divided into three universities, namely the National Chengdu University, the Chengdu Normal University and the Public Sichuan University. In 1931, however, they were reintegrated to form the National Sichuan University (ÂúãÁ´ãÂõõÂ∑ùÂ§ßÂ≠∏). By 1949, the National Sichuan University had been developed into one of the largest multidisciplinary universities in China, with arts, science, engineering, agriculture, law, and normal schools and a total of 25 departments.

After the foundation of the PRC, the name was changed to Sichuan University. In the 1950s, the national &quot;adjustment of colleges and departments&quot; (Èô¢Á≥ªË∞ÉÊï¥) was organized, after which SCU specialized in arts and science. The schools of engineering and agriculture was mostly split off to form two new universities: the Engineering Institute of Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩÂ∑•Â≠¶Èô¢) and the Sichuan Institute of Agriculture. The normal school was merged into Southwest Normal University and Sichuan Teachers College. The school of law became part of the Southwest College of Political Science and Law. A number of departments in agriculture was transferred to the Southwest Institute of Agriculture, while the department of aeronautics was affiliated under the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics.
Engineering Institute of Chengdu, established in 1954, specialized in chemical engineering, hydroelectricity, mechanics, textiles, and light industry. In 1978, it was renamed to Chengdu University of Science and Technology (CUST).

The West China School of Medicine was originally founded as a private medical school, known as West China Union College. It became a public university after the foundation of the PRC, being renamed to Sichuan Medical College in 1953 and West China University of Medical Science (WCUMS) in 1985. It was established in 1910 by five Christian missionary groups from the U.S., UK and Canada, with offered courses in stomatology, biomedicine, basic medicine and clinical medicine.

In 1994, the SCU, CUST and WCUMS merged to form the Sichuan Union University (ÂõõÂ∑ùËÅîÂêàÂ§ßÂ≠¶). The university adopted the current name in 1998.
