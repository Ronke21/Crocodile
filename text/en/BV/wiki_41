<doc id="618988" wikidata="Q233327" url="?curid=618988" title="List of car brands">
<text>This is an incomplete list of every brand (also known as make or marque) of car ever produced, by country of origin, which has an article on Wikipedia. Names should not be added unless they already have an article. Some are from manufacturing companies that also use their company name as a brand name; others are from subsidiary companies or divisions, or are products of badge engineering. This is not a list of every brand that is available for sale in each country, but a list of companies that originated or have a significant &quot;independent&quot; presence in each country. This typically means manufacturing in that country and often exporting from that country, not just selling cars there.

<doc id="618991" wikidata="Q411216" url="?curid=618991" title="Phenylthiocarbamide">
<text>Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), also known as phenylthiourea (PTU), is an organosulfur thiourea containing a phenyl ring.

It has the unusual property that it either tastes very bitter or is virtually tasteless, depending on the genetic makeup of the taster. The ability to taste PTC is often treated as a dominant genetic trait, although inheritance and expression of this trait are somewhat more complex.

PTC also inhibits melanogenesis and is used to grow transparent fish.

About 70% of people can taste PTC, varying from a low of 58% for Indigenous Australians and indigenous peoples of New Guinea to 98% for indigenous peoples of the Americas. One study has found that non-smokers and those not habituated to coffee or tea have a statistically higher percentage of tasting PTC than the general population. PTC does not occur in food, but related chemicals do, and food choice can be related to a person&#x27;s ability to taste PTC.

== History ==
The tested genetic taste phenomenon of PTC was discovered in 1931 when DuPont chemist Arthur Fox accidentally released a cloud of fine crystalline PTC. A nearby colleague complained about the bitter taste, while Fox, who was closer and should have received a strong dose, tasted nothing. Fox then continued to test the taste buds of assorted family and friends, setting the groundwork for future genetic studies. The genetic penetrance was so strong that it was used in paternity tests before the advent of DNA matching.

The PTC taste test has been widely used in school and college practical teaching as an example of Mendelian polymorphism in human populations. Based on a taste test, usually of a piece of paper soaked in PTC (or the less toxic propylthiouracil (PROP)), students are divided into taster and non-taster groups. By assuming that PTC tasting is determined by a dominant allele at a single autosomal gene, and that the class is an unbiased sample from a population in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, students then estimate allele and genotype frequencies within the larger population. While this interpretation is broadly consistent with numerous studies of this trait, it is worth noting that other genes, sex, age and environmental factors influence sensitivity to PTC. Also, there are several alleles segregating at the major gene determining the taste of PTC, particularly in African populations, and the common &quot;taster&quot; allele is incompletely dominant (homozygotes for this allele are more sensitive to PTC than are heterozygotes). Additionally, PTC is toxic and sensitivity to the substitute, PROP, does not show a strong association with the gene controlling ability to taste PTC.

== Role in taste ==
There is a large body of evidence linking the ability to taste thiourea compounds and dietary habits. Much of this work has focused on 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PROP), a compound related to PTC that has lower toxicity. A supertaster has more of an ability to taste PTC. On the other hand, heavy cigarette smokers are more likely to have high PTC and PROP thresholds (i.e. are relatively insensitive).

In 1976, an inverse relationship between taster status for PTC and for a bitter component of the fruit of the tree &quot;Antidesma bunius&quot; was discovered. Research on the implications still continues.

Ability to taste PTC may be correlated with a dislike of plants in the genus &quot;Brassica&quot;, presumably due to chemical similarities. However, studies in Africa show a poor correlation between PTC tasting and dietary differences.

== Genetics ==

Much of the variation in tasting of PTC is associated with polymorphism at the TAS2R38 taste receptor gene. In humans, there are three SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) along the gene that may render its proteins unresponsive. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the inheritance of this trait is dominant or incompletely dominant. Any person with a single functional copy of this gene can make the protein and is sensitive to PTC. Some studies have shown that homozygous tasters experience a more intense bitterness than people that are heterozygous; other studies have indicated that another gene may determine taste sensitivity.

The frequency of PTC taster and non-taster alleles vary in different human populations. The widespread occurrence of non-taster alleles at intermediate frequencies, much more common than recessive alleles conferring genetic disease, across many isolated populations, suggests that this polymorphism may have been maintained through balancing selection.

Chimpanzees and orangutans also vary in their ability to taste PTC, with the proportions of tasters and non-tasters similar to that in humans. The ability to taste PTC is an ancestral trait of hominids that has been independently lost in humans and chimpanzees, through distinct mutations at TAS2R38.

<doc id="618993" wikidata="Q4573184" url="?curid=618993" title="Surge (drink)">
<text>Surge (sometimes styled as SURGE) is a citrus-flavored soft drink first produced in the 1990s by the Coca-Cola Company to compete with Pepsi&#x27;s Mountain Dew. Surge was advertised as having a more &quot;hardcore&quot; edge, much like Mountain Dew&#x27;s advertising at the time, in an attempt to lure customers away from Pepsi. It was originally launched in Norway as Urge in 1996, and was so popular that it was released in the United States as Surge in 1997. Lagging sales caused production to be ended in 2003 for most markets.

However, popular fan bases such as Facebook&#x27;s &quot;SURGE Movement&quot; led Coca-Cola to re-release the soft drink on September 15, 2014, for the US market via Amazon Prime in 12-packs of cans. Following a test-market for the beverage in the Southeastern United States in early 2015, Surge was re-released primarily in convenience stores in the Eastern United States and some Mountain states in September 2015. Surge was re-released internationally in September 2018 in Burger King restaurants in the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.

==History==

===Early years===

Surge, under the name of Urge, was first launched on the Norwegian market as a test product on April 22, 1996. It was first formally unveiled by Coca-Cola on December 16, 1996. Prior to production, its original white paper name was &quot;MDK,&quot; or &quot;Mountain Dew Killer&quot;, as it was developed to converge with Mello Yello as a means of slowing Mountain Dew growth. Coke&#x27;s attempts to draw users away with divergent products like OK Soda or with similar ones like Mello Yello had not succeeded. Surge was intended to improve on Mountain Dew by using maltodextrin for a longer-lasting blast of energy and with bolder, brighter presentation.

While preparations for the US launch were underway, the Norwegian branch of Coca-Cola was battling a successful launch of Mountain Dew in their market. Because the Surge brand was already registered by another firm, the product was launched as &quot;Urge&quot; and bottled by Ringnes, bottler of other Coca-Cola products at the time. It was seen as a competitor of the Norwegian orange soda Solo, also bottled by Ringnes. The Norwegian market was chosen as a test market due to high consumption of carbonated beverages – then fifth worldwide – and its small population, making it easy to get feedback quickly.

Local food regulation prevented the bright green color from being used, so it was launched with a pale, more natural juice drink look and given a slight orange taste to match the flavor with the color. The label&#x27;s color was described as &quot;grungy green and orange&quot;, which were noted as being fashionable at the time.

The product sold well, particularly among the 12–19 age group, leading to its worldwide release. By the end of January 1997, the product had reached 2.2% market share in Norway. The sale of Surge in North America began on January 13, 1997, when the drink was released to 140 markets across the United States. Its release was accompanied by a $50 million nationwide marketing campaign that led to high sales and popularity. A few years after the release, sales began to slip. Surge continued to be sold in vending machines, and promotional coolers. The Surge coolers were placed in high traffic areas in gas stations as a key promotion to push sales away from competitors coolers in the back of stores all over the United States. Surge could be found in cans and fountain drinks until its eventual discontinuation in 2003.
Until September 15, 2014, when Coca-Cola re-released Surge, Norway was the only country where one could still buy a similar soft drink in any form, as the original Surge recipe was still popular there.

Surge was widely associated with the extreme sports lifestyle, with television commercials similar to those used by Mountain Dew at the time. The drink was also prominently advertised by World Championship Wrestling, with product placement on WCW Monday Nitro and pay-per-view. Coca-Cola also used provocative catchphrases to market Surge to extreme sports enthusiasts and teenagers alike. Some of these catchphrases included &quot;Feed the Rush&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;s a Scream&quot; and the references to Surge as &quot;A Fully Loaded Citrus Soda.&quot; Further touted was that Surge had a considerable number of carbohydrates, hence the &quot;with carbos&quot; tagline that was occasionally used in the marketing campaigns to emphasize the fact that Surge was supposed to be more than a soda, but an energy drink as well.

After its inception, Surge&#x27;s logo was updated and redesigned to a sharper and more modern look by graphic designer and marketer Colin Nekritz.

===Trademark===
In 1997 Coca-Cola settled a trademark dispute with Babson Bros., an industrial cleaning product company whose cow-milking machine has been known as Surge since 1925.

===Revival===
After the discontinuation of Surge in cans, a community was formed by web designer Eric &quot;Karks&quot; Karkovack entitled &quot;Save Surge&quot;. The community initially mapped the locations at which Surge could be purchased in fountain form. Upon cancellation of the fountain syrup, the community continued, adopting an approach of activism that led to the creation of the citrus soda Vault in June 2005. After Vault&#x27;s release, Karkovack announced the closure of SaveSurge.org. Vault was discontinued in 2011.

As a result of Vault&#x27;s discontinuation, a group was started on Facebook by Evan Carr called the &quot;Surge Movement&quot;. The group repeatedly posted requests on Coca-Cola&#x27;s Facebook page, and encouraged its members to call Coca-Cola&#x27;s consumer affairs hotline at 1-800-GET-COKE to voice their desires further, once every month. The movement gained around 200,000 Facebook &quot;likes&quot; in the months after it was started and continues to grow.

On September 15, 2014, Surge was re-released as an Amazon.com exclusive in packs of twelve cans.

On February 10, 2015, Coca-Cola announced that it had begun test-marketing Surge with independent resellers and vending machines across the Southeast United States. The test run ended in late-May 2015. Two months later, Coca-Cola announced that it was preparing for a large-scale Surge retail release across the Eastern United States. Surge was re-released at convenience stores across the Eastern United States on September 7, 2015.

In August 2018, Surge became available in Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, exclusively at Burger King. It is available in several varieties, including Cherry, Grape, Vanilla, and Zero Sugar.

===Slushy versions===
In 1999, 7-Eleven introduced a Surge-flavored Slurpee.

On November 16, 2015, Burger King restaurants released a slushy version of the beverage called &quot;Frozen Surge&quot; as a limited edition slushy. Burger King reintroduced it in their restaurants as a fountain drink in August, 2018 

In late 2016, Valero Corner Stores partnered with Icee to release an Icee form of Surge at select locations.

On January 11, 2017, Cinemark Theatres released a slushy version of the beverage called &quot;Surge Frozen&quot; for a limited time before being discontinued in spring 2017.

==Formulation==
Comparisons of Surge have been made to a later Coca-Cola product, Vault, which was first released in 2005—around two years after the discontinuation of Surge. Vault has also been discontinued as of December 2011. The two drinks are noted to have had similar taste, although Vault contained higher levels of caffeine at 70.5 mg per 12 fl. oz serving (equivalent to ) and contained artificial flavors in its recipe. The caffeine content of Surge was comparable to that of other citrus soft drinks in the American market during its time at 51 mg per 12 fl. oz serving ().

Below is a listing of the ingredients of Surge, per the label on the canned and bottled versions, as well as the ingredient listings from both a Surge fountain syrup box, and a Surge frozen carbonated beverage (FCB) box. All four differ slightly; however, more information regarding the Surge formulation can be gleaned from both syrup variations, as they were to be mixed using a ratio of 4.4 parts cold, carbonated water to 1 part syrup.

<doc id="618997" wikidata="Q3711921" url="?curid=618997" title="Dive (Belgian band)">
<text>Dive is a Belgian electronic body music project formed in 1990 by Dirk Ivens (Absolute Body Control, Klinik, Blok 57, Sonar). Dive&#x27;s &quot;audio trademark&quot; is the experimental sound of abused drum machines, pulsating through crackling distortion on almost every song.

==History==
Dirk Ivens began Dive as a solo project in 1990 during the waning days of his participation in the band Klinik. With Dive, Dirk sought to have complete control over his creative process as a change from his many previous years working with bands. Dive as a musical concept was intended to project a far more minimal presence, not only in terms of the equipment and sounds produced, but in live performances as well; Dirk performs on stage with just himself and his recordings and minimal visual presentation.

The earliest Dive works were produced with only a rhythm machine and several effects units that, together, produced rhythmic, distorted noise tracks overlain with Dirk&#x27;s vocals - always processed, sometimes distorted. The overall presentation was that of &quot;noise as noise&quot; with instructions in the liner notes that the music was &quot;to be played at maximum volume.&quot; With the release of &quot;Snakedressed&quot;, Dive took on a more club-friendly sound with a wider sonic palette and less pronounced distortion.

Although explicitly a solo project of Ivens&#x27;, Dirk has worked numerous times in the studio with composer and Minus Habens label founder Ivan Iusco. Several tracks included in the albums &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot;, &quot;Snakedressed&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot; and &quot;Underneath&quot; are written and produced by Ivan. Rafael M. Espinosa of Geistform also produced several tracks for &quot;Behind The Sun&quot; and &quot;Underneath&quot;. The latest album &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; was made in collaboration with Jan Dewulf (Your Life On Hold and Diskonnekted). It is available as regular CD and as a wooden box, limited to 500 copies, including the album on vinyl, the CD and an exclusive vinyl EP with extended versions and remixes from Numb and Suicide Commando.

Dive&#x27;s live performances have always remained a solo effort.

<text>NetZero is an Internet service provider based in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California. It is a subsidiary of United Online, which in turn is a subsidiary of investment bank B. Riley Financial. United Online is also the parent of Juno Online Services and BlueLight Internet Services.

== History ==

Netzero bought FreeInet around 1998. FreeInet was the first free national internet service provider. NetZero was launched in October 1998, founded by Ronald T. Burr (original CEO), Stacy Haitsuka, Marwan Zebian and Harold MacKenzie. NetZero grew to 1,000,000 users in six months. NetZero&#x27;s model was free Internet access to attract an audience for highly targeted advertising. NetZero was the first company to invent real-time URL targeted advertising based on surfing patterns under US patent 6,366,298 Monitoring of Individual Internet Usage. The founders raised $60 million in venture capital in four separate equity financings. Venture investors included idealab, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Foundation Capital, Clearstone Venture Partners and Compaq. NetZero signed a distribution deal with Compaq and was the only ISP to be included in the out-of-box experience (OOBE). In September 1999, NetZero went public on the NASDAQ exchange with the symbol NZRO. Mark Goldston was hired as CEO, Charles Hilliard was hired as CFO and Ronald Burr took the position of President and Chief Technology Officer.

NetZero&#x27;s most prominent advertising placement was as part of &quot;NetZero @ the Half&quot; for the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot;″s halftime show in the early 2000s, replacing Prudential.

In late 1999 several other companies began to copy the NetZero free access model including Juno Online Services, (which since August 1996 had offered E-mail but not World Wide Web access for free), Spinway launched with Yahoo! and AltaVista, Freei and BlueLight Internet, which was originally owned by Kmart. They claimed to offer free Internet service forever, in exchange for displaying ads, either on a permanent toolbar or on a &quot;banner&quot; that was shown when online. NetZero sued them for infringing on a banner ad patent. After the dot-com bust in early 2000, NetZero acquired its competitors as each went bankrupt. In addition NetZero acquired AimTV which displayed full video quality 30 second ad spots as well as Simpli and RocketCash.

Starting in January 2001, NetZero began charging for access time over 40 hours per month. Users who exceeded 40 hours were directed to the company&#x27;s &quot;Platinum&quot; service, which provided unlimited access for $9.95 per month. With the income statement reinvigorated through charging heavier users of the system, NetZero merged with its rival Juno Online Services and created a new holding company, United Online which traded on NASDAQ under the symbol UNTD until Netzero was acquired by B. Riley Financial in July 2016. NetZero later lowered the threshold for their free service to 10 hours per month.

In June 2005, the company released a new client that replaced the advertising bar with an Internet Explorer Browser Helper Object. In July 2005, NetZero introduced a service called &quot;3G,&quot; standing for the &quot;third generation of Internet.&quot; The company vaguely claimed it was so fast, &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t broadband.&quot; As dial-up connections are subject to the limits of 56k modems, the service does not increase transmission speed. Instead, the service prefetches HTML markup, JavaScript and other small files and compresses them. Video, images, and other non-text files are not compressed. This technology also utilizes the user&#x27;s cache to prevent redownloading. A newer service, &quot;NetZero DSL&quot; was released soon after. In 2012, the company said they still had about 750,000 dial-up subscribers.

NetZero has versions of its proprietary dial-up software for computers running Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X. NetZero previously offered a Linux version of the NetZero software advertised as being for Linspire, however the software could be installed on any Debian-based i386 or x86-64 Linux distribution, NetZero can also be installed on any RPM-based Linux distribution as long as Alien is used to convert the NetZero Debian package into an RPM package. In addition, the Linux version requires the Java Runtime Environment to be installed prior to use of the NetZero dialer. However the current Linux version of the dialer no longer functions properly with the service since 2009.

== Wireless service ==
While continuing to provide nationwide dial-up access service (and DSL broadband service) in March 2012, NetZero launched a mobile broadband service for users who purchase their hardware, using the Clearwire network. It has since expanded the service across the nationwide Sprint 3G network, and also launched a home wireless broadband service which is intended to provide wireless access in the home or office. In 2013, it debuted NetZero DataShield, a personal virtual private network which encrypts and protects users’ data when they connect to the Internet via any WiFi connection, including public WiFi access points.
The company offers NetZero Hotspot.

<text>HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; (F60) was a Batch 3 of the Royal Navy (RN). She was, like the rest of the class, named after a figure of mythology. Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders of Scotstoun, she was launched on 4 September 1967 and commissioned on 9 August 1969.

==Service history==
=== 1970s ===

In 1970, HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; deployed to the West Indies. In 1971, she joined Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), a multi-national squadron of NATO. In 1972, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was again present in the West Indies as part of STANAVFORLANT taking over the duty of HMS &quot;Naiad&quot; which had suffered a mechanical breakdown. The following year, &quot;Jupiter&quot; took part in the Second Cod War. On 26 May 1973, she and her Wasp helicopter assisted the British trawler &quot;Everton&quot;, which was taking water after being hit by naval gunfire from the Icelandic gunboat &quot;Ægir&quot;. Jupiter then visited Africa on her way to the Far East and Pacific, and carried out a variety of duties, including performing fly-the-flag visits to numerous ports. &quot;Jupiter&quot; also visited Christchurch, New Zealand during the 1974 Commonwealth Games and the American naval base at Pearl Harbor where some propulsion problems were sorted out. Charles, Prince of Wales joined &quot;Jupiter&quot; as Ship&#x27;s Communications Officer in January 1974 and remained until her return to the UK later that year.

In late 1976, &quot;Jupiter&quot; joined the 7th Frigate Squadron as Captain F7, &quot;Jupiter&quot; led the 7th Frigate Squadron in the annual Group Deployment (Group 5 - January to May 1977, led by FOF2 in the cruiser ), performing naval exercises and visiting the Caribbean Sea and Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, Brazil in April 1977 and Funchal, Madeira. She also took part in the Fleet Review at Spithead on 28 June 1977, in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. After the Fleet Review, frigates of the 7th Frigate Squadron visited different ports in south Wales, &quot;Jupiter&quot; visiting Cardiff in early July 1977. Later that year, &quot;Jupiter&quot; became the Gibraltar Guard ship and in 1979 represented the United Kingdom in the Siege of Savannah 200th Anniversary.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; also enjoyed fame on BBC TV, through starring as in the acclaimed drama series &quot;Warship&quot;. All members of the crew were given HMS &quot;Hero&quot; cap tallies for filming purposes. The main ship used for filming was, however, .

=== 1980s ===

In 1980, &quot;Jupiter&quot;″s modernisation commenced, and included the addition of the Sea Wolf missile system, as well as the removal of her twin gun turret in favour of the Exocet anti-ship missile. The boilers were modified to the Babcock &amp; Wilcox Y160 Steam Atomisation type water-tube boiler. the modernisation was completed in 1983.

On 13 June 1984, as she was leaving the Pool of London after a visit to the capital, she collided with London Bridge, causing significant damage to both ship and bridge. The ship&#x27;s captain, Commander Colin Hamilton, was later court martialled at Portsmouth on 4 December 1984. Hamilton was severely reprimanded.

In September 1986, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was part of the NATO exercise &quot;Autumn Train &#x27;86&#x27;&quot; and visited Gibraltar, then spent a continuous four weeks in the Mediterranean Sea, and returned to Gibraltar prior to returning to her (then) home base of Plymouth. &quot;Jupiter&quot; changed her home port to Portsmouth in 1985. She was a member of the 7th Frigate Squadron.

In 1986, &quot;Jupiter&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf—the Armilla Patrol—in partnership with , and , and while there, helped in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth nationals from the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen after a campaign to overthrow the government of that country began. Her exploits were broadcast by the BBC World Service.

During the Armilla Patrol, &quot;Jupiter&quot; paid courtesy calls to Gibraltar, Djibouti, Aqaba, Doha, Muscat, and Mombasa, and returned via the Suez Canal and Piraeus. After a transit of the Corinth Canal.

Between 1984 and 1986, &quot;Jupiter&quot; also visited Bremerhaven, Amsterdam, Bordeaux and Middlesbrough.
In September 1986, she was Guard ship to the Tall Ships Race visit to Newcastle upon Tyne.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; was twinned with the town of Middlesbrough in North East England.

=== 1990s ===

During the First Gulf War, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was on Armilla Patrol, which was created in 1980 in response to the increased danger posed by the Iran–Iraq War to British interests. Her last deployment came in late 1991 to early 1992 when she deployed to the South Atlantic as the Guard ship and returned via Rio de Janeiro and Barbados where she carried out anti drug patrols. &quot;Jupiter&quot; decommissioned in 1992 after a final visit to her affiliated town of Middlesbrough. She was sold for scrap in 1997 and towed to Alang in India to be beached and broken up.

<text>Quinzinzinzili is a science fiction novel written in 1935 by the French author Régis Messac (1893 - 1945). 
This was one of the first post-cataclysmic novels.

At the time of World War II (which Messac anticipated), a Japanese scientist develops a chemical reaction that combines the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. The air becomes unbreathable for the majority of species, and humanity is swept with mass extinction. 
Ten children left in a deep cave survive and find the purified Earth. 
The man who accompanies them, their tutor, witnesses the creation of a new humanity.

<text>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a handheld game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in PAL regions on September 1, 2005, and is the first handheld installment in the PlayStation line of consoles. As a seventh generation console, the PSP competed with the Nintendo DS.

Development of the PSP was announced during E3 2003, and the console was unveiled at a Sony press conference on May 11, 2004. The system was the most powerful portable console at the time of its introduction, and was the first viable competitor to Nintendo&#x27;s handheld consoles after many challengers such as Nokia&#x27;s N-Gage had failed. The PSP&#x27;s advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device, which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, any computer with a USB interface, other PSP systems, and the Internet. The PSP also had a vast array of multimedia features such as video playback, audio playback, and has been considered a portable media player as well. The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format—in this case, Universal Media Disc (UMD)—as its primary storage medium; both games and movies have been released on the format.

The PSP was received positively by critics, and sold over 80 million units during its ten-year lifetime. Several models of the console were released, before the PSP line was succeeded by the PlayStation Vita, released in Japan first in 2011 and worldwide a year later. The Vita has backward compatibility with PSP games that were released on the PlayStation Network through the PlayStation Store, which became the main method of purchasing PSP games after Sony shut down access to the store from the PSP on March 31, 2016. Hardware shipments of the PSP ended worldwide in 2014; production of UMDs ended when the last Japanese factory producing them closed in late 2016.

== History ==
Sony Computer Entertainment first announced development of the PlayStation Portable at a press conference preceding E3 2003. Although samples were not presented, Sony released extensive technical details. CEO Ken Kutaragi called the device the &quot;Walkman of the 21st century&quot;, a reference to the console&#x27;s multimedia capabilities. Several gaming websites were impressed with the handheld&#x27;s computing capabilities, and looked forward to its potential as a gaming platform.

In the 1990s, Nintendo had dominated the handheld market since launching its Game Boy in 1989, experiencing close competition only from Sega&#x27;s Game Gear (1990–1997) and Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan (1999-2001) and WonderSwan Color (2000–2004) in Japan. In January 1999, Sony had released the briefly successful PocketStation in Japan as its first foray into the handheld gaming market. The SNK Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia&#x27;s N-Gage also failed to cut into Nintendo&#x27;s share. According to an IDC analyst in 2004, the PSP was the &quot;first legitimate competitor to Nintendo&#x27;s dominance in the handheld market&quot;.

The first concept images of the PSP appeared at a Sony corporate strategy meeting in November 2003, and featured a model with flat buttons and no analog joystick. Although some reviewers expressed concern about the lack of an analog stick, these fears were allayed when the PSP was officially unveiled at the Sony press conference during E3 2004. Sony released a list of 99 developer companies that pledged support for the new handheld. Several game demos such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; and Studio Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; were also shown at the conference.

The PSP&#x27;s development posed several challenges for Sony and third-party developers, with battery life being a primary concern. To address this, Sony implemented power management strategies, including restricting the CPU to two-thirds of its full speed for the first few years. The Universal Media Disc (UMD) drive was another significant hurdle, as it drained the battery and had slow read speeds. Developers had to optimize their game data layout to minimize disc access and reduce power consumption. These limitations sometimes led to performance constraints and long loading times, with some titles like &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot; experiencing load times of up to two minutes for certain scenes.

=== Launch ===
On October 18, 2004, Sony announced that the PSP base model would be launched in Japan on December 11 that year for ¥19,800 (about US$181 in 2004) while the Value System would launch for ¥24,800 (about US$226). The launch was a success, with over 200,000 units sold on the first day of sales. Color variations were sold in bundle packs that cost around $200. On February 3, 2005, Sony announced that the PSP would be released in North America on March 24 in one configuration for an MSRP of US$249/CA$299. Some commentators expressed concern over the high price, which was almost US$20 higher than that of the Japanese model and over $100 higher than the Nintendo DS. Despite these concerns, the PSP&#x27;s North American launch was a success; Sony said 500,000 units were sold in the first two days of sales, though it was also reported that this figure was below expectations.

The PSP was originally intended to have a simultaneous PAL and North American launch, but on March 15, 2005, Sony announced that the PAL launch would be delayed due to high demand for the console in Japan and North America. The next month, Sony announced that the PSP would be launched in the PAL region on September 1, 2005, for €249/£179. Sony defended the high price by saying North American consumers had to pay local sales taxes and that the Value Added Tax (sales tax) was higher in the UK than the US. Despite the high price, the PSP&#x27;s PAL launch was a success, with the console selling over 185,000 units in the UK. All stock of the PSP in the UK sold out within three hours of its launch, more than doubling the previous first-day sales record of 87,000 units set by the Nintendo DS. The system also enjoyed great success in other areas of the PAL region; over 25,000 units were pre-ordered in Australia and nearly one million units were sold across Europe in the system&#x27;s first week of sales.

== Hardware ==
The PlayStation Portable uses the common &quot;bar&quot; form factor. The original model measures approximately and weighs . The front of the console is dominated by the system&#x27;s LCD screen, which is capable of 480 × 272 pixel display resolution with 24-bit color, outperforming the Nintendo DS. Also on the unit&#x27;s front are the four iconic PlayStation face buttons (, , , ); the directional pad, the analog &quot;nub&quot;, and several other buttons. The system also has two shoulder buttons, a USB 2.0 mini-B port on the top of the console, and a wireless LAN switch and power cable input on the bottom. The back of the PSP features a read-only Universal Media Disc (UMD) drive for access to movies and games, and a reader compatible with Sony&#x27;s Memory Stick PRO Duo flash cards is located on the left of the system. Other features include an IrDA-compatible infrared port (this was discontinued in PSP-2000 and later) and a two-pin docking connector; built-in stereo speakers and headphone port; and IEEE 802.11b Wi-Fi for access to the Internet, free online multiplayer gaming via PlayStation Network, the ability to purchase games from PlayStation Store (now discontinued), and data transfer.

The PSP uses two 333 MHz MIPS32 R4000 R4k-based CPUs, as a main CPU and Media Engine, a GPU running at 166 MHz, and includes 32 MB main RAM (64 MB on PSP-2000 and later models), and 4 MB embedded DRAM split between the aforementioned GPU and Media Engine. The hardware was originally forced to run more slowly than it was capable of; most games ran at 222 MHz. With firmware update 3.50 on May 31, 2007, however, Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at 333 MHz.

The PSP is powered by an 1800 mAh battery (1200 mAh on the 2000 and 3000 models) that provides between about three and six hours of gameplay, between four and five hours of video playback, or between eight and eleven hours of audio playback.
To make the unit slimmer, the capacity of the PSP&#x27;s battery was reduced from 1800 mAh to 1200 mAh in the PSP-2000 and 3000 models. The original high-capacity batteries work on the newer models, giving increased playing time, though the battery cover does not fit. The batteries take about 1.5 hours to charge and last for between four-and-a-half and seven hours depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, the use of WLAN, and volume levels. In March 2008, Sony released the Extended Life Battery Kit in Japan, which included a bulkier 2200 mAh battery with a fitting cover. In Japan, the kit was sold with a specific-colored cover matching the many PSP variations available. The North American kit released in December 2008 was supplied with two new covers; one black and one silver.

=== Revisions ===
==== PSP-2000 ====

The PSP-2000, marketed in PAL countries as the &quot;PSP Slim&quot;, is the first redesign of the PlayStation Portable. The PSP-2000 system is slimmer and lighter than the original PSP, reduced from and from . At E3 2007, Sony released information about a slimmer and lighter version for the device, which was first released in Hong Kong on August 30, 2007, in Europe on , in North America on , in South Korea on , and in Australia on . The UK release for the PSP-2000 was September 14.

The serial port was modified to accommodate a new video-out feature, making it incompatible with older PSP remote controls. On the PSP-2000, games only output to external monitors and televisions in progressive scan mode. Non-game video outputs work in either progressive or interlaced mode. USB charging was introduced and the D-Pad was raised in response to complaints of poor performance, and the responsiveness of the buttons was improved.

Other changes include improved WLAN modules and micro-controller, and a thinner, brighter LCD screen. To improve the poor loading times of UMD games on the original PSP, the internal memory (RAM and Flash ROM) was doubled from 32 MB to 64 MB, part of which now acting as a cache, also improving the web browser&#x27;s performance.

==== PSP-3000 ====
In comparison with the PSP-2000, the 3000, marketed in PAL areas as &quot;PSP Slim &amp; Lite&quot; or &quot;PSP Brite&quot;, has an improved LCD screen with an increased color range, five times the contrast ratio, a halved pixel response time, new sub-pixel structure, and anti-reflective technology to reduce outdoor glare. The disc tray, logos, and buttons were all redesigned, and a microphone was added. Games could now be output in either component or composite video using the video-out cable. One outlet called this model &quot;a minor upgrade&quot;.
The PSP-3000 was released in North America on October 14, 2008, in Japan on , in Europe on , and in Australia on . In its first four days on sale in Japan, the PSP-3000 sold over 141,270 units, according to &quot;Famitsu&quot;; it sold 267,000 units during October.

On its release, a problem with interlacing when objects were in motion on the PSP-3000 screen was noticed. Sony announced this problem would not be fixed.

==== PSP Go (N1000) ====

The PSP Go (model PSP-N1000) was released on October 1, 2009, in North American and European territories,&lt;ref name=&quot;NA/EU release&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 31 in Japan. It was revealed prior to E3 2009 through Sony&#x27;s Qore video on demand service. Its design is significantly different from other PSP models.

The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. Its rechargeable battery is not intended to be removed by the user. It has a 480 × 272 pixel LCD screen, which slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to those of Sony&#x27;s mylo COM-2 Internet device.
The PSP Go features 802.11b Wi-Fi like its predecessors, although the USB port was replaced with a proprietary connector. A compatible cable that connects to other devices&#x27; USB ports is included with the unit. The new multi-use connector allows video and sound output with the same connector using an optional composite or component AV cable. As with previous models, Sony also offers a cradle (PSP-N340) for charging, video out, and USB data transfer on the PSP Go. This model adds support for Bluetooth connectivity, which enables the playing of games using a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 controller. The use of the cradle with the controller allow players to use the PSP Go as a portable device and as a console, although the output is not upscaled. PlayStation 1 games can be played in full screen using the AV/component cable or the cradle.

The PSP Go lacks a UMD drive, and instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory, which can be extended by up to 32 GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro (M2). Games must be downloaded from the PlayStation Store. The removal of the UMD drive effectively region-locks the unit because it must be linked to a single, region-locked PlayStation Network account. While the PSP Go can download games to itself, users can also download and transfer games to the device from a PlayStation 3 console, or the Windows-based software Media Go.

All downloadable PSP and PlayStation games available for older PSP models are compatible with the PSP Go. Sony confirmed that almost all UMD-based PSP games released after October 1, 2009, would be available to download and that most older UMD-only games would also be downloadable.

In February 2010, it was reported that Sony might re-launch the PSP Go due to the lack of consumer interest and poor sales. In June 2010, Sony began bundling the console with 10 free downloadable games; the same offer was made available in Australia in July. Three free games for the PSP Go were offered in America. In October that year, Sony announced it would reduce the price of the unit. On April 20, 2011, the manufacturer announced that the PSP Go would be discontinued outside of North America so it could concentrate on the PlayStation Vita.

==== PSP Street (E1000) ====

The PSP-E1000, which was announced at Gamescom 2011, is a budget-focused model that was released across the PAL region on October 26 of that year. The E1000 model lacks Wi-Fi capability and has a matte finish similar to that of the slim PlayStation 3. It has a mono speaker instead of the previous models&#x27; stereo speakers and lacks a microphone. This model also lacked the physical brightness buttons from the front of the handheld, instead offering brightness controls in the System Software&#x27;s &#x27;Power Save Settings&#x27; menu.

An ice-white version was released in PAL territories on July 20, 2012.

=== Bundles and colors ===
The PSP was sold in four main configurations. The Base Pack, called the Core Pack in North America, contained the console, a battery, and an AC adapter. This version was available at launch in Japan and was released later in North America and Europe.

Many limited editions of the PSP were bundled with accessories, games, or movies.

The first two initial releases of the Slims in North America were both on September 10, 2007, were the Daxter PSP. Included with the bundle was an Ice Silver PSP with a Daxter UMD, the Family Guy : Freaking Sweet Collection, and a 1 GB Memory Stick for usage. The other was a Piano Black Only PSP

Limited-edition models were first released in Japan on September 12, 2007; North America and Europe on September 5; in Australia on September 12, and in the UK on October 26. The PSP-2000 was made available in piano black, ceramic white, ice silver, mint green, felicia blue, lavender purple, deep red, matte bronze, metallic blue, and rose pink as standard colors. Several special-edition consoles were colored and finished to sell with certain games, including &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot; (ice silver engraved), &quot;Star Ocean: First Departure&quot; (felicia blue engraved), &quot;Gundam&quot; (red gloss/matte black), and &quot;Monster Hunter Freedom&quot; (gold silkscreened) in Japan, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (Darth Vader silkscreened), and &quot;God of War: Chains of Olympus&quot; (Kratos silkscreened) in North America, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (bright yellow with white buttons, analog and disc tray) in Australia and New Zealand, and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (red gloss/matte black) in Europe.

The PSP-3000 was made available in piano black, pearl white, mystic silver, radiant red, vibrant blue, spirited green, blossom pink, turquoise green and lilac purple for standard colors. For limited edition colors were &quot;Big Boss Pack&quot; of &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; had a camouflage pattern while the &quot;God of War: Ghost of Sparta&quot; bundle pack included a black-and-red two-toned PSP. The &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot; Cosmos &amp; Chaos edition that was released on March 3, 2011, has an Amano artwork as the PSP&#x27;s face plate.

=== Comparison ===
Below is a comparison of the different PlayStation Portable models:

== Software ==
=== System software ===

The PSP runs a custom operating system referred to as the System Software, which can be updated over the Internet, or by loading an update from a Memory Stick or UMD. Sony offers no method for downgrading such software.

While System Software updates can be used with consoles from any region, Sony recommends only downloading updates released for the model&#x27;s region. System Software updates have added many features, including a web browser, Adobe Flash support, additional codecs for various media, PlayStation 3 (PS3) connectivity, and patches against security exploits and the execution of homebrew programs. The most recent version, numbered 6.61, was released on January 15, 2015.

=== Apps and functionality ===
==== Web browser ====
The PSP Internet Browser is a version of the NetFront browser and came with the system via the 2.00 update. The browser supports most common web technologies, such as HTTP cookies, forms, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It features basic tabbed browsing and has a maximum of three tabs.

==== Remote Play ====

Remote Play allows the PSP to access many of the features of the PlayStation 3 console from a remote location using the PS3&#x27;s WLAN capabilities, a home network, or the Internet. Using Remote Play, users can view photographs, listen to music, and watch videos stored on the PS3 or connected USB devices. Remote Play also allows the PS3 to be turned on and off remotely and lets the PSP control audio playback from the PS3 to a home theater system. Although most of the PS3&#x27;s capabilities are accessible with Remote Play, playback of DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, PlayStation games, PlayStation 2 games, most PS3 games, and copy-protected files stored on the hard drive are not supported.

==== VoIP access ====
Starting with System Software version 3.90, the PSP-2000, 3000, and Go could use the Skype VoIP service. Due to hardware constraints it was not possible to use the service on the PSP-1000. The service allowed Skype calls to be made over Wi-Fi and – on the Go – over the Bluetooth modem. Users had to purchase Skype credit to make telephone calls. Skype for PlayStation®Portable was discontinued on June 22, 2016.

==== Room for PlayStation Portable ====

At Tokyo Game Show 2009, Sony announced that a service similar to PlayStation Home, the PS3&#x27;s online community-based service, was being developed for the PSP. Named &quot;Room&quot; (stylized &quot;R∞M&quot;), it was being beta-tested in Japan from October 2009 to April 2010. It could be launched directly from the PlayStation Network section of the XMB. As in Home, PSP owners would have been able to invite other PSP owners into their rooms to &quot;enjoy real time communication&quot;. Development of Room halted on , 2010, due to feedback from the community.

==== SensMe application ====
The SensMe software, which had already existed on some Walkman music players and Sony Ericsson handsets, was added to the PSP through a software update in 2009. It is a music analyser that reads music files stored on the PSP and categorises them into &quot;channels&quot; representing moods and creates automatic playlists from it. The PSP has support for the playback of MP3 and ATRAC audio files, as well as WMA since firmware version 2.60.

==== Digital Comics Reader ====
Sony partnered with publishers such as Rebellion Developments, Disney, IDW Publishing, Insomnia Publications, , Marvel Comics, and Titan Books to release digitized comics on the PlayStation Store. The Digital Comics Reader application required PSP firmware 6.20.

The PlayStation Store&#x27;s &quot;Comic&quot; section premiered in Japan on , 2009, with licensed publishers ASCII Media Works, Enterbrain, Kadokawa, Kodansha, Shueisha, Shogakukan, Square-Enix, Softbank Creative (HQ Comics), Hakusensha, Bandai Visual, Fujimishobo, Futabasha, and Bunkasha. It launched in the United States and in English-speaking PAL countries on , 2009, though the first issues of &quot;Aleister Arcane&quot;, &quot;Astro Boy: Movie Adaptation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise Experiment&quot; and &quot;Transformers: All Hail Megatron&quot; were made available as early as through limited-time PlayStation Network redemption codes. In early 2010 the application was expanded to the German, French, Spanish and Italian languages. The choice of regional Comic Reader software is dictated by the PSP&#x27;s firmware region; the Japanese Comic Reader will not display comics purchased from the European store, and vice versa. Sony shut down the Digital Comics service in September 2012.

==== x-Radar Portable ====
In Japanese market PSPs, an application called x-Radar Portable came preloaded starting with firmware version 6.35 (January 2010). This is a port of a map software for PCs and mobile phones called x-Radar, developed by PetaMap. x-Radar Portable gets the location of the PSP on a map and obtains information of places around the user. It determines the location through &quot;PlaceEngine&quot; technology, via wireless LAN spots.

=== Homebrew development and custom firmware ===
On June 15, 2005, hackers disassembled the code of the PSP and distributed it online. Initially the modified PSP allowed users to run custom code and a limited amount of protected software, including custom-made PSP applications such as a calculator or file manager. Sony responded to this by repeatedly upgrading the software. Some users were able to unlock the firmware to allow them to run more custom content and DRM-restricted software. Hackers were able to run protected software on the PSP through the creation of ISO loaders that could load copies of UMD games from a memory stick. Custom firmware including the M33 Custom Firmware, Minimum Edition (ME/LME) CFW and PRO CFW were commonly seen in PSP systems.

=== Content management ===
The management of media content of the PSP through personal computers was fulfilled by Sony&#x27;s PSP Media Manager software for Windows, allowing transfer as well as music/video playback and backups. In 2009 the PSP Media Manager was replaced by Media Go.

== Games ==
There were 1,370 games released for the PSP during its 10-year lifespan. Launch games for PSP included; &quot;Ape Escape: On the Loose&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (all regions), &quot;Lumines&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Need for Speed: Underground Rivals&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;NFL Street 2: Unleashed&quot; (North America, Europe), &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Spider-Man 2 (2004)&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2 Remix&quot; (North America, Europe), &quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot; (North America, Europe), &quot;Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade&quot; (North America, Europe, Japan), &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; (all regions), and &quot;World Tour Soccer: Challenge Edition&quot; (North America, Europe). Additionally, &quot;Gretzky NHL&quot; and &quot;NBA&quot; were North America exclusive launch titles. The best selling PSP game is &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;, which sold 8 million copies as of March 2008.

Other top selling PSP games include &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;, &quot;Monster Hunter Portable 3rd&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, and &quot;Monster Hunter Freedom Unite&quot;. &quot;Retro City Rampage DX&quot;, which was released in July 2016, was the final PSP game that was released. The best rated PSP games on Metacritic are &quot;God of War: Ghost of Sparta&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;, and &quot;Daxter&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; is the only PSP game to receive a perfect score from Famitsū. During E3 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that the Greatest Hits range of budget titles were to be extended to the PSP system. On , 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment America released the first batch of Greatest Hits titles. These titles included &quot;Ape Escape:On the Loose&quot;, &quot;ATV Offroad Fury: Blazin&#x27; Trails&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots: Open Tee&quot;, &quot;Twisted Metal: Head-On&quot;, and &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot;. The PSP Greatest Hits lineup consists of games that have sold 250,000 copies or more and have been released for nine months. PSP games in this lineup retail for $19.99 each. Downloadable games were limited to 1.8 GB, most likely to guarantee a potential UMD release. A section of the PlayStation Store was dedicated to &quot;Minis&quot;; smaller, cheaper games available as download only.

Trophy support was planned for the PSP but the idea was cancelled after the firmware was cracked.

=== Demos and emulation ===
In late 2004, Sony released a series of PSP demo games, including &quot;Duck In Water&quot;, &quot;world/ball&quot;, &quot;Harmonic City&quot;, and &quot;Luga City&quot;. Demos for commercial PSP games could be downloaded and booted directly from a Memory Stick. Demos were sometimes issued in UMD format and mailed out or given to customers at retail outlets. In addition, several older PlayStation games were re-released; these can be played on the PSP using emulation. , this feature could be officially accessed through the PlayStation Network service for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation Vita (or PlayStation TV), or a personal computer. Emulation of the PSP is well-developed; the first emulator was pspplayer by Noxa, which ran on C#, then afterwards was JPCSP which ran on Java. PPSSPP is currently the fastest and most compatible PSP emulator; it supports all major games.

=== Data installation ===
In mid 2009, as larger memory stick storage became available for the PSP, the ability to pre-install some or all data from a game became a feature in certain games. Although for a large majority of the games the feature merely improved load times, there were a small number of games that added features, such as speech in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;.

== Peripherals ==

Official accessories for the console include an AC adapter, car adapter, headset, headphones with remote control, extended-life 2200 mAh battery, battery charger, console carrying case, game carrying case, accessories pouch and cleaning cloth, and system pouch and wrist strap. A 1seg television tuner peripheral (model PSP-S310), designed specifically for the PSP-2000, was released in Japan on September 20, 2007.

Sony sold a GPS accessory for the PSP-2000; this was released first in Japan and announced for the United States in 2008. It features maps on a UMD and offers driving directions and city guides. A digital camera add-on, the Go!Cam, was also released.

After the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP-to-HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device is compatible with the PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP Go. To overcome the problem of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black border, the LKV-8000 has a zoom button on the connector. A few other Chinese companies have released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay on a large screen.

== Reception ==

The PSP received generally positive reviews soon after launch; most reviewers noted similar strengths and weaknesses. CNET awarded the system 8.5 out of 10 and praised the console&#x27;s powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities but lamented the lack of a guard to cover the screen and the reading surface of UMD cartridges. Engadget praised the console&#x27;s design, stating that &quot;it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld&quot;. PC World commended the built-in Wi-Fi capability but criticized the lack of a web browser at launch, and the glare and smudges that resulted from the console&#x27;s glossy exterior. Most reviewers also praised the console&#x27;s large, bright viewing screen and its audio and video playback capabilities. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; listed the PSP as a &quot;gotta have travel gadget&quot;, citing the console&#x27;s movie selection, telecommunications capability, and upcoming GPS functionality.

The PlayStation Portable was initially seen as superior to the Nintendo DS when both devices were revealed in early 2004 because of the designers&#x27; emphasis on the technical accomplishments of the system. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime, however, focused on the experience aspect of the Nintendo DS. The DS started to become more popular than the PSP early on because it attracted more third-party developers, and appealed more to the casual gaming market. The DS sold more units partly because of its touchscreen and second display.

From a multimedia perspective, the PSP has also been seen as a competitor to portable media players, notably the iPod Video that was released in the same year.

Reviews of the PSP Go were mixed. It was mainly criticized for its initial pricing; &quot;Ars Technica&quot; called it &quot;way too expensive&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that cost was the &quot;biggest issue&quot; facing the machine. Engadget said the Go cost only $50 less than the PS3, which has a Blu-ray player. &quot;Wired&quot; said the older PSP-3000 model was cheaper and supports UMDs, and IGN stated that the price increase made the PSP Go a &quot;hard sell&quot;. The placement of the analog stick next to the D-pad was also criticized. Reviewers also commented on the change from a mini-USB port to a proprietary port, making hardware and cables bought for previous models incompatible. The Go&#x27;s screen was positively received by &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, which called the screen&#x27;s image &quot;brilliant, sharp and clear&quot; and &quot;T3&quot; stated that &quot;pictures and videos look great&quot;. The controls received mixed reviews; &quot;The Times&quot; described them as &quot;instantly familiar&quot; whereas CNET and &quot;Stuff&quot; called the position of the analog stick &quot;awkward&quot;. The device&#x27;s capability to use a PS3 controller was praised by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; but &quot;Ars Technica&quot; criticized the need to connect the controller and the Go to a PS3 for initial setup.&quot;&quot;

=== Sales ===

By March 31, 2007, the PlayStation Portable had shipped 25.39 million units worldwide with 6.92 million in Asia, 9.58 million in North America, and 8.89 million Europe. In Europe, the PSP sold 4 million units in 2006 and 3.1 million in 2007, according to estimates by Electronic Arts. In 2007, the PSP sold units in the US, according to the NPD Group and 3,022,659 in Japan according to Enterbrain. In 2008, the PSP sold 3,543,171 units in Japan, according to Enterbrain.

In the United States, the PSP had sold 10.47 million units by January 1, 2008, according to the NPD Group. In Japan, during the week –30, 2008, the PSP nearly outsold all of the other game consoles combined, selling 129,986 units, some of which were bundled with &quot;Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G&quot;, which was the bestselling game in that week, according to Media Create. As of , 2008, the PSP had sold 11,078,484 units in Japan, according to Enterbrain. In Europe, the PSP had sold units as of , 2008, according to SCE Europe. In the United Kingdom, the PSP had sold units as of , 2009, according to GfK Chart-Track.

From 2006 to the third quarter of 2010, the PSP sold 53 million units. In a 2009 interview, Peter Dillon, Sony&#x27;s senior vice-president of marketing, said piracy of video games was leading to lower sales than hoped. Despite being aimed at a different audience, the PSP competed directly with the Nintendo DS. During the last few years of its life cycle, sales of the PSP models started to decrease. Shipments to North America ended in January 2014, later in Europe, and on June 3, 2014, Sony announced sales of the device in Japan would end. Production of the device and sales to the rest of Asia would continue. During its lifetime, the PSP sold 80 million fewer units than the Nintendo DS.

== Marketing ==
In late 2005, Sony said it had hired graffiti artists to spray-paint advertisements for the PSP in seven major U.S. cities, including New York City, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. According to Sony, it was paying businesses and building owners for the right to spray-paint their walls. A year later, Sony ran a poster campaign in England; a poster bearing the slogan &quot;Take a running jump here&quot; was removed from a Manchester Piccadilly station tram platform due to concerns it might encourage suicide.

Later in 2006, news of a billboard advertisement released in the Netherlands depicting a white woman holding a black woman by the jaw, saying &quot;PlayStation Portable White is coming&quot;, spread. Two similar advertisements existed; one showed the two women facing each other on equal footing in fighting stances, the other showed the black woman in a dominant position on top of the white woman. Sony&#x27;s stated purpose was to contrast the white and black versions of the PSP, but the advertisements were interpreted as being racially charged. These advertisements were never released in the rest of the world and were withdrawn from the Netherlands after the controversy. The advertisement attracted international press coverage; Engadget said Sony may have hoped to &quot;capitalize on a PR firestorm&quot;.

Sony came under scrutiny online in December 2006 for a guerrilla marketing campaign in which advertisers posed as young bloggers who desperately wanted a PSP. The site was created by advertising firm Zipatoni.

At E3 2010, Sony created a fictional 12-year-old character that was used by Sony Computer Entertainment America as part of their &quot;Step Your Game Up&quot; advertising campaign for the PlayStation Portable and PSPgo consoles in North America, as part of the PlayStation 3&#x27;s &quot;It Only Does Everything&quot; advertising campaign. The character, Marcus Rivers, was played by child-actor Bobb&#x27;e J. Thompson, and started as the publicist of the PlayStation Portable division of Sony, responding to &quot;Dear PSP&quot; queries. Marcus was additionally used to advertise games for the system. The character was eventually discontinued, with the &quot;Dear PSP&quot; campaign continuing without them.

<text>William Robert Brooks (June 11, 1844 – May 3, 1921) was a British-born American astronomer, mainly noted as being one of the most prolific discoverers of new comets of all time, second only to Jean-Louis Pons.

==Early life==

William Robert Brooks was born in Maidstone, England, the son of Caroline (&quot;née&quot; Wickings) and William Brooks, a Baptist minister who emigrated to Marion, New York. He developed his interest in astronomy during a boyhood voyage to Australia, when he observed a navigator making measurements with a sextant. The following year, he built his very first telescope at the age of 14. Using his own diagrams and sketches, Brooks gave his first public lecture at the age of 17 at his fathers church. As a young man he worked in the Shepherd Iron Works in Buffalo, New York, gaining considerable mechanical and draughtsmanship skills: he went on to become a portrait photographer in Phelps before turning his attention to astronomy full-time. Brooks had a good knowledge of lens construction, and was able to design and make his own telescopes, taking years to grind and polish the necessary lenses and reflectors. 

==Comet discoveries==

After marrying Mary E. Smith in 1870, Brooks moved to Phelps where he discovered his first comet in 1881 at the Red House Observatory, which happened to be his own observatory that harbored telescopes of his own construction. Between the years of 1881 and 1887, Brooks went on to discover 10 more comets. He set a record in 1886 by discovering three novel comets in just one month. 

A brief anecdote of his time in Phelps is found on pages 261–262 of &quot;Country Lawyer&quot; written by Bellamy Partridge, who gives him the pseudonym, Billy Bob Rivers. 

Brooks observed 16 novel comets at The Smith Observatory in Geneva, New York.

He specialized in the discovery of comets, including periodic comets 12P/Pons–Brooks and 16P/Brooks. He also discovered the bright naked-eye comet C/1911 O1 (Brooks), and was a pioneer of astrophotography.

His final comet discovery came on October 20, 1912. Brooks was a traveling lecturer at the time and named the comet &quot;Lasell Brooks&quot; after having lectured at Lasell College multiple times. This was his final comet discovery. 

William Robert Brooks had discovered 27 comets in his lifetime. This is second all time to Jean-Louis Pons, who had discovered 37 a half century earlier.

== The Smith Observatory ==
Brooks&#x27; success as an astronomer caught the eye of William Smith, a nurseryman and philanthropist. Smith had a strong desire to bring astronomy to Geneva to not only further his own academic pursuits, but to also expose his townsmen to a greater understanding of the universe. 

In an effort to become his patron, Smith offered to construct Brooks his own observatory, as well as a house nearby for his family. He even met with Brooks, who was working as a photographer in Phelps at the time. Eventually, Brooks agreed and in 1888, The Smith Observatory was constructed at Geneva in Ontario County, New York. 

The observatory housed a tower that was 17&#x27; in diameter and 34&#x27; in height. It contained two specialized telescopes, both of which were built by John Casey. The first was a 10&quot; aperture equatorial refractor telescope. The second was meridian telescope that had an attached astronomical clock. Both the dome and mount of the observatory were constructed by the Warner &amp; Swasey Company stationed out of Cleveland, Ohio. 

Brooks used The Smith Observatory to primarily make observations and further his research, but it also served as a teaching location. Brooks was known to regularly provide public lectures at the observatory for anyone interested. Brooks was even known to publish educational pamphlets explaining and describing the solar system for nearby locals. In 1895, Brooks officially opened the observatory to students of nearby Hobart College. 

Hobart College hired Brooks in 1900 and for the next 20 years, he taught astronomy in the Smith Observatory. He was later promoted to Director of the Observatory. Brooks was a very popular lecturer amongst the students and garnered the reputation of being known as &quot;Sky&quot; Brooks. 

In 1906, William Smith gifted the observatory to the college for which the college is now named Hobart and William Smith Colleges. The observatory is official property of the university.

==Awards==

In his life, Brooks received medals from the Lick Observatory, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the International Jury at the St. Louis Exhibition, the Astronomical Society of Mexico, and the Lalande Medal of the French Academy of Sciences in 1899. Brooks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1888. The Warner Prize was also awarded to Brooks for his specific comet discovers in the following years: 1883, 1885, 1886, and 1887. Towards the end of this life, he was appointed a Professor and Honorary Doctor of Science by Hobart College.

Minor planet 2773 Brooks is named in his honor.

==Death==

While working extensively through the night to photograph an approaching comet, Brooks fell in February of 1921. He was bedridden at home for several months following, until he passed on May 3 in Geneva, New York. William Robert Brooks is buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Geneva, New York. 

Following his death, Hobart College released this statement on May 12: &quot;In the death of William Robert Brooks, Hobart College has suffered a distinct loss... It will be a long time before Hobart in every respect will be able to reconcile itself to the loss of our late professor, who for more than twenty years gave to her the fruit of his many years of study and research.&quot;

<text>Steve Englehart (; born April 22, 1947) is an American writer of comic books and novels. He is best known for his work at Marvel Comics and DC Comics in the 1970s and 1980s. His pseudonyms have included John Harkness and Cliff Garnett.

==Early life==
Steve Englehart majored in psychology at Wesleyan University, where he was a member of The Kappa Alpha Society, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969. He had served in the United States Army, but was honorably discharged as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War.

==Career==

===Marvel Comics===

Englehart&#x27;s first work in comics was as an art assistant to Neal Adams on a 10-page story by writer Denny O&#x27;Neil in Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror comics magazine &quot;Vampirella&quot; #10 (March 1971). After briefly serving as a member of the Crusty Bunkers, Englehart started working as a full-time writer. He began with a co-writing credit, with Gardner Fox, on the six-page, Englehart-drawn &quot;Retribution&quot; in Warren&#x27;s &quot;Eerie&quot; #35 (Sept. 1971). Then, as Marvel editor Roy Thomas said in a 2007 interview, Englehart became
Englehart said he had first done uncredited co-scripting on a number of stories:
This uncredited work included Friedrich&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; #97, &quot;Iron Man&quot; #45, and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2, #152, plus two romance comics stories and a Western tale. Englehart then wrote two romance stories under the pseudonym Anne Spencer, in &quot;Our Love&quot; #18 (Aug. 1972) and &quot;My Love&quot; #19 (Sept. 1972), and, under his own name, a standalone supernatural story in the anthology &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; vol. 2, #1 (Oct. 1972)

During his first credited superhero work, on a series starring erstwhile X-Men member the Beast in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; vol. 2, #12–17 (May 1972 – March 1973), Englehart integrated the Patsy Walker character, the star of a teen romantic-comedy series, into the Marvel Universe alongside the company&#x27;s superheroes. He and artist Sal Buscema launched &quot;The Defenders&quot; as an ongoing series in August 1972 and introduced the Valkyrie to the team in issue #4 (Feb. 1973). Englehart has stated that he added the Valkyrie to the Defenders &quot;to provide some texture to the group.&quot;

He wrote &quot;The Avengers&quot; from issue #105 (Nov. 1972) to #152 (Oct. 1976). During his time on that title, he wrote several major storylines including &quot;The Avengers Defenders War&quot; in issues #115–118 (Sept.–Dec. 1973), crossing over into &quot;The Defenders&quot; #8–11 (Sept.–Dec. 1973); &quot;The Celestial Madonna&quot; in #129–135 (Nov. 1974 – May 1975) and &quot;Giant-Size Avengers&quot; #2–4 (Nov. 1974 – May 1975); and &quot;The Serpent Crown&quot; in #141–144 (Nov. 1975 – Feb. 1976) and #147–149 (May–July 1976).

In the fall of 1972, Englehart and writers Gerry Conway and Len Wein crafted a metafictional unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein&#x27;s first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in &quot;Thor&quot; #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, &quot;It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It&#x27;s really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back — it didn&#x27;t matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel — I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do.&quot;

Englehart had a run on &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (originally with artist Frank Brunner, later with Gene Colan), in which Strange&#x27;s mentor, the Ancient One, died, and Strange became the new Sorcerer Supreme. Englehart and Brunner, audaciously, also created a multi-issue storyline in which a sorcerer named Sise-Neg (&quot;Genesis&quot; spelled backward) goes back through history, collecting all magical energies, until he reaches the beginning of the universe, becomes all-powerful and creates it anew, leaving Strange to wonder whether this was, paradoxically, the original creation (&quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #14). Editor-in-chief Stan Lee, seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but &quot;a&quot; god, so as to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake letter from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas; Marvel unwittingly printed the letter, and dropped the retraction order. Englehart&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #14 featured a crossover story with &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #44, another series which was being drawn by Gene Colan at the time. In Englehart&#x27;s final story for the series, he sent Dr. Strange back in time to meet Benjamin Franklin.

Describing that time, Englehart said in 1998,
Englehart and artist Starlin co-created the character Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, though they only worked on the early issues of the series. Englehart reconciled the existence of Captain America and sidekick Bucky in Marvel&#x27;s 1950s precursor, Atlas Comics, an anomaly that had been ignored since Captain America&#x27;s 1964 reintroduction to Marvel presented him as having been in suspended animation since 1945. Englehart&#x27;s newly retconned history stated that the 1950s Captain America and Bucky had been different characters from the ones who had debuted in the 1940s. This was followed by an extended storyline of Steve Rogers becoming so profoundly disillusioned with the United States that he temporarily abandoned his Captain America identity to become Nomad until he decided to refocus his purpose as the defender of America&#x27;s ideals, not necessarily its government. The Englehart/Sal Buscema run on the &quot;Captain America&quot; title saw the series become one of Marvel&#x27;s top-sellers. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart&#x27;s work on &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; fourth, eighth, and ninth, respectively, on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

In March 1976, Englehart had a falling-out with Marvel and left the company.

===DC Comics===
Englehart, in fact, planned to quit comics altogether and pursue novels, but DC Comics publisher Jenette Kahn persuaded him to come to DC. His only previous credited work for the company had been scripting the Batman story &quot;Night of the Stalker!&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #439 (Feb–March 1974). &quot;I said, &#x27;Okay I&#x27;ll fix &quot;Justice League [of America]&quot; for you, but I&#x27;m only going to do this for a year.&quot; To that end, he wrote &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #139–146 and 149–150, with artist Dick Dillin, and additionally wrote an eight-issue arc of Batman stories in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #469–476, with pencilers Walt Simonson and Marshall Rogers. In this arc, he recreated the Batman as a pulp-oriented, dark character; the Joker&#x27;s persona as a homicidal maniac; and introduced love interest Silver St. Cloud. Englehart claims this storyline was adapted as the first Batman film in 1989, with Englehart providing uncredited development. The Englehart and Rogers pairing was described in 2009 by comics writer and historian Robert Greenberger as &quot;one of the greatest&quot; creative teams to work on the Batman character. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz noted that &quot;Arguably fans&#x27; best-loved version of Batman in the mid-1970s, writer Steve Englehart and penciller Rogers&#x27;s &quot;Detective&quot; run featured an unambiguously homicidal Joker...in noirish, moodily rendered stories that evoked the classic Kane-Robinson era.&quot; In their story &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot;, the Joker is brazen enough to disfigure fish with a rictus grin, then expects to be granted a federal trademark on them, only to start killing bureaucrats who try to explain that obtaining such a claim on a natural resource is legally impossible. The &quot;Detective Comics&quot; storyline was reprinted in trade paperback in 1999 as &quot;Batman: Strange Apparitions&quot;. Englehart and Rogers had a short run on DC&#x27;s revived &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; series as well.

His run on &quot;Justice League of America&quot; included another unofficial crossover between DC and Marvel in issue #142 by reworking his character Mantis into the DC Universe as a character named &quot;Willow&quot;. Other contributions to the series were crafting a new origin for the team and the induction of the character Hawkwoman into the team&#x27;s membership.

Englehart temporarily left comics at this juncture, moving to Europe before his first issue of &quot;Detective&quot; was published. During this time he wrote a fantasy/occult novel, &quot;The Point Man&quot;, which was republished in 2010.

A 25-page Englehart-Rogers story featuring Madame Xanadu, originally commissioned for &quot;Doorway to Nightmare&quot;, sat in inventory for years before being published as the one-shot &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; in 1981, in DC&#x27;s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the &quot;direct market&quot; of fans and collectors.

===Return to Marvel===
In 1983, Marvel&#x27;s creator-owned imprint Epic Comics published &quot;Coyote&quot;, a series he had earlier created at Eclipse Comics with Rogers, in collaboration with artist Steve Leialoha. Among those he collaborated with on the title was a young Todd McFarlane, whom Englehart hired on the basis of McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Coyote&quot; art samples, which was McFarlane&#x27;s first comic book work.

Englehart returned to mainstream Marvel comics later that decade with stints on &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;, the second &quot;Vision and the Scarlet Witch&quot; limited series (with artist Richard Howell), &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; (again with Rogers), and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (during which editorial disputes led to his using the pseudonym John Harkness, a name he had first used on his last issue of &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;). Englehart was going to be the regular writer of &quot;Daredevil&quot; in 1986 but left after only one issue due to an editorial conflict.

Simultaneously, Englehart wrote DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, overseeing the title&#x27;s name change to &quot;Green Lantern Corps.&quot; During that time he also wrote both the DC weekly crossover series &quot;Millennium&quot; (Jan–Feb 1988) and the first two issues of the spin-off The New Guardians. Issue #2 was notable for featuring the villain SnowFlame, a superpowered human who derived his powers from cocaine.

===Other comic work===
In 1992, Jim Shooter hired Englehart to write for Valiant Comics where he scripted issue #1–4 of &quot;X-O-Manowar&quot; and the first issue of &quot;Shadowman&quot;.

Also in 1992, he co-created the Ultraverse comics universe for Malibu Comics and wrote &quot;Night Man&quot; and the superhero-team series &quot;The Strangers&quot;. &quot;Night Man&quot; was later adapted for a syndicated television series which ran for two seasons. Englehart wrote three episodes of the television series. He also wrote issues of other Malibu comic series like &quot;Freex&quot;, &quot;Hardcase&quot; and &quot;Prototype&quot;.

For Claypool Comics, he wrote the supernatural series &quot;Phantom of Fear City&quot; #1–12 (May 1993 – May 1995) and, for Topps Comics, several &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; limited series in the years 1993 to 1995.

===Return to Marvel and DC===
In the early 2000s, Englehart returned to comics to write the miniseries &quot;Hellcat&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four: Big Town&quot; and &quot;&quot; for Marvel and stories for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot; for DC. In 2005, he reunited with Rogers and Austin on the miniseries &quot;Batman: Dark Detective&quot;, elements of which he alleged were adapted into the Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. The next year, he wrote a storyline featuring the Detroit Era Justice League and the Justice Society of America that ran in &quot;JLA Classified&quot; #22–25 and &quot;JSA Classified&quot; #14–16 for DC, and the one-shot &quot;Strange Westerns starring the Black Rider&quot; for Marvel.

===Novels===
Starting in 1994, he wrote a series of young adult books for Avon, including the &quot;DNAgers&quot; series (with his wife, Terry) and the &quot;Countdown&quot; series. &quot;Countdown to Flight&quot; was selected by NASA for its school curriculum on the Wright Brothers.

In the mid-2000s, Englehart turned his 1980 novel, &quot;The Point Man&quot;, into Book Zero for a series concerning its hero, Max August. The first sequel, &quot;The Long Man&quot;, was published in 2009, &quot;The Plain Man&quot; in 2011, and &quot;The Arena Man&quot; in 2013. In the series, Max became immortal in 1985 and is dealing with the consequences two decades later in real time.

He has admitted to writing the novel &quot;Hellstorm&quot; in the TALON Force series under the house pseudonym Cliff Garnett.

===Film and TV===
For producer Michael Uslan, Englehart wrote early treatments and served as script doctor for the &quot;Batman&quot; film that was based on his comics series; it was later scripted by Sam Hamm and directed by Tim Burton. He wrote three episodes of the television series &quot;Night Man&quot;, an adaptation of the comic series of the same name that he had created for Malibu Comics. Englehart also worked in animation, with episodes of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe Extreme&quot;, and wrote one of the three episodes in Disney&#x27;s &quot;&quot; film. His screenplay for an unproduced film, &quot;Majorca&quot;, was published as a book by Black Coat Press.

Several of Englehart&#x27;s characters appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The 2014 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; featured his character Star-Lord. He returned in its 2017 sequel &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, which also featured Mantis. Both characters appear in &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; (both 2022), and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). The 2021 film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; features his character Shang-Chi.

===Music===
in 2019, Steve Englehart appeared in the music video for &quot;Welcome To My World&quot; by ZorDonofDoom. In 2021, Englehart created titles and themes based on Shang-Chi for the album &quot;Prism Club&quot; from InRage Entertainment.

<text>16P/Brooks, also known as Brooks 2, is a periodic comet discovered by William Robert Brooks on July 7, 1889, but failed to note any motion. He was able to confirm the discovery the next morning, having seen that the comet had moved north. On August 1, 1889, the famous comet hunter Edward Emerson Barnard discovered two fragments of the comet labeled &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; located 1 and 4.5 arc minutes away. On August 2, he found another four or five, but these were no longer visible the next day. On August 4, he observed two more objects, labeled &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;. &quot;E&quot; disappeared by the next night and &quot;D&quot; was gone by the next week. Around mid-month, &quot;B&quot; grew large and faint, finally disappearing at the beginning of September. &quot;C&quot; managed to survive until mid-November 1889. The apparition ended on January 13, 1891. After the discovery apparition, the comet has always been over two magnitudes fainter.

== 1886 ==
The comet&#x27;s breakup is believed to have been caused by the passage of the comet within Jupiter&#x27;s Roche limit around 20 July 1886, when it spent two days within the orbit of Io.

The very close approach to Jupiter in 1886 resulted in the previous perihelion distance becoming the new aphelion distance.

On 31 December 2016 the comet passed from Jupiter and on 5 July 2053 ± 3 days it will pass about from Jupiter.

<text>The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), also known as the Rocky Mountain goat, is a cloven-footed mammal that is endemic to the remote and rugged mountainous areas of western North America. A subalpine to truly alpine species, it is a sure-footed climber commonly seen on sheer rock faces, near-vertical cliffs and icy passages. Mountain goats generally avoid venturing down into lower elevations—except during seasonal food shortages or during particularly bad weather—as the extreme elevation which they inhabit is their primary defense against predators such as black and brown bears, pumas and wolves.

Despite its vernacular name and both genera being in the same subfamily (Caprinae), the mountain goat is not a member of &quot;Capra&quot;, the genus that includes all true goats (such as the wild goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot;), from which the domestic goat is derived); rather, it is more closely allied with the other bovids known as “goat-antelopes”, including the European chamois (&quot;Rupicapra&quot;), the gorals (&quot;Naemorhedus&quot;), the takins (&quot;Budorcas&quot;) and the serows (&quot;Capricornis&quot;), of Japan and eastern South Asia.

== Classification and evolution ==
The mountain goat is an even-toed ungulate of the order Artiodactyla and the family Bovidae (along with antelopes, gazelles, and cattle). It belongs to the subfamily Caprinae, along with true goats, wild sheep, the chamois, the muskox and other species. The takins of the Himalayan region, while not a sister lineage of the mountain goat, are nonetheless very closely related and almost coeval to the mountain goat; they evolved in parallel from an ancestral goat. Other members of this group are the bharal, the true goats, and the Himalayan tahr. The sheep lineage is also very closely related, while the muskox lineage is somewhat more distant. The mountain goats probably diverged from their relatives in the late Tortonian, some 7.5 to 8 million years ago.

Given that all major caprine lineages emerged in the Late Miocene and contain at least one but usually several species from the eastern Himalayan region, their most likely place of origin is between today&#x27;s Tibet and Mongolia or nearby. The mountain goat&#x27;s ancestors thus probably crossed the Bering Strait after they split from their relatives, presumably before the Wisconsinian glaciation. No Pliocene mountain goats have been identified yet; the known fossil record is fairly recent, entirely from North America, and barely differs from the living animals. In the Pleistocene era, the small prehistoric mountain goat &quot;Oreamnos harringtoni&quot; lived in the southern Rocky Mountains. Ancient DNA studies suggest that this was the sister species of the living mountain goat, not its ancestor; consequently, the living species would also date back to the Pleistocene at least.

The mountain goat is the only living species in the genus &quot;Oreamnos&quot;. The name &quot;Oreamnos&quot; is derived from the Greek term &quot;óros&quot; (stem &quot;ore-&quot;) meaning &quot;mountain&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;oreas&quot; &quot;mountain nymph&quot;) and the word &quot;amnós&quot; meaning &quot;lamb&quot;.

== General appearance and characteristics ==

Both male and female mountain goats have beards, short tails, and long black horns, in length, which contain yearly growth rings. They are protected from the elements by their woolly greyish white double coats. The fine, dense wool of their undercoats is covered by an outer layer of longer, hollow hairs. Mountain goats molt in spring by rubbing against rocks and trees, with the adult billies shedding their extra wool first and the pregnant nannies shedding last. Their coats help them to withstand winter temperatures as low as and winds of up to .
A male goat stands about at the shoulder to the waist and can weigh considerably more than the female (around 30% more in some cases). Male goats also have longer horns and longer beards than females. The head-and-body length can range from , with a small tail adding .

The mountain goat&#x27;s feet are well-suited for climbing steep, rocky slopes with pitches exceeding 60°, with inner pads that provide traction and cloven hooves that can spread apart. The tips of their feet have sharp dewclaws that keep them from slipping. They have powerful shoulder and neck muscles that help propel them up steep slopes. Based on a field recording in the Rocky Mountains of Canada of a mountain goat climbing a 45-degree slope, researchers were able to measure the goat&#x27;s whole body movement as it climbed. Researchers observed that when the goat propelled itself forward, it extended its back legs and the front legs were tucked close up to its chest during its first phase. During the second phase, the goat raised its back legs near to its chest, while the front leg&#x27;s humerus stayed locked in a persistent location relative to the goat&#x27;s chest, therefore allowing the elbow to be detained in close proximity to the whole body&#x27;s center of balance. Extension of the elbow and carpal joints resulted in a vertical translation of the center of mass up the mountain slope.

== Range and habitat ==

The mountain goat inhabits the Rocky Mountains and Cascade Range and other mountain regions of the Western Cordillera of North America, from Washington, Idaho and Montana through British Columbia and Alberta, into the southern Yukon and southeastern Alaska. British Columbia contains half of the world&#x27;s population of mountain goats. Its northernmost range is said to be along the northern fringe of the Chugach Mountains in south-central Alaska. Introduced populations can also be found in such areas as Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, South Dakota, and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington.

Mountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude habitats, which can exceed elevations of . They sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas although they are primarily an alpine and subalpine species. The animals usually stay above the tree line throughout the year but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Winter migrations to low-elevation mineral licks often take them several kilometers through forested areas.

== Movement patterns ==

Daily movements by individual mountain goats are primarily confined to areas on the same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual&#x27;s needs for foraging, resting, thermoregulation and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (such as movements to and from mineral licks/salt lick), reproductive needs (in other words, movement of pre-parturient females to &quot;kidding&quot; areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (including movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (thermal cover effects) to access forage. The farthest movements are expected to be by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.

== Diet ==

Mountain goats are herbivores and spend most of their time grazing. Their diets include grasses, herbs, sedges, ferns, mosses, lichens, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat.
In captivity, the mountain goat&#x27;s diet can also include grain, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and grass.

== Life cycle and mating ==
In the wild, mountain goats usually live 12to15 years, with their lifespans limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for 16-20years.

Mountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months. Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized estrus in late October through early December, at which time females and males participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Nannies often ignore young billies, who try to participate but are discounted in favor of older partners. Both females and males usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, females and males move away from each other. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals. The adult billies leave, often alone or with two or three other billies.
Kids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six-month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge; &quot;post partum&quot;, they lick the kid dry and ingest the placenta. Kids weigh a little over at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although lactation is mostly finished at one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.

== Aggressive behavior ==
Nannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources. They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd. In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns. These conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless. To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.

In regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Predators, including wolves, wolverines, lynxes, and bears, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The cougar, or mountain lion, is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from both bald and golden eagles, which can be a predatory threat to kids. Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier bighorn sheep that share some of their territory. In 2021, a mountain goat gored a grizzly bear to death in Yoho National Park, British Columbia.

Mountain goats introduced in the 1920s into Washington’s Olympic Mountains were in time found to be a nuisance there, in particular while seeking human urine and sweat for its salt content, the park lacking natural salt licks, and even aggressively approaching human visitors. One such goat killed a hiker in 2010. Officials finally chose to eradicate them from the Olympic Peninsula, removing hundreds, mostly by capturing them and relocating them to the Cascade Mountains.

== Wool ==

Although mountain goats have never been domesticated and commercialized for their wool, pre-Columbian indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast did incorporate their wool into their weaving by collecting spring moulted wool left by wild goats.

== Threats ==
Avalanches can constitute 23-65% of Alaskan mountain goat mortality depending on the region.

<doc id="619023" wikidata="Q2812388" url="?curid=619023" title="Elopement">
<text>Elopement is a marriage which is conducted in a sudden and secretive fashion, sometimes involving a hurried flight away from one&#x27;s place of residence together with one&#x27;s beloved with the intention of getting married without parental approval. An elopement is contrasted with an abduction (e.g., a bride kidnapping), in which either the bride or groom has not consented, or a shotgun wedding in which the parents of one (prototypically the bride&#x27;s) coerce both into marriage.

Controversially, in modern times, &quot;elopement&quot; is sometimes applied to any small, inexpensive wedding, even when it is performed with parental foreknowledge.

The term &quot;elopement&quot; is sometimes used in its original, more general sense of escape or flight, e.g. an escape from a psychiatric institution. In this context, &quot;elopement&quot; (or &quot;wandering&quot;) can refer to a patient with dementia leaving the psychiatric unit without authorization. It has also referred to a married person leaving their spouse in order to run away with a third party.

==Background==
Today the term &quot;elopement&quot; is colloquially used for any marriage performed in haste, with a limited public engagement period or without a public engagement period. Some couples elope because they wish to avoid parental or religious objections. 

In some modern cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower social status, because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. They are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman&#x27;s family expects, the bride price (not to be confused with a dowry, paid by the &quot;woman&#x27;s&quot; family). In some areas, elopement is met with violent reactions from family members, while in other places eloping has become more accepted.

==Examples==
===United Kingdom===
In England, a prerequisite of Christian marriage is the &quot;reading of the banns&quot;—for any three Sundays in the three months prior to the intended date of the ceremony, the names of every couple intending marriage has to be read aloud by the priest(s) of their parish(es) of residence, or the posting of a &#x27;Notice of Intent to Marry&#x27; in the registry office for civil ceremonies. The intention of this is to prevent bigamy or other unlawful marriages by giving fair warning to anybody who might have a legal right to object. In practice, however, it also gives warning to the couples&#x27; parents, who sometimes objected on purely personal grounds. To work around this, it is necessary to get a special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury—or to flee somewhere the law did not apply.

For civil marriages notices must be posted for 28 clear days, at the appropriate register office.

===Southeast Asia=== 

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, elopement is called &quot;&quot;tanan&quot;. &quot;Tanan&quot; is a long-standing practice in Filipino culture when a woman leaves her home without her parents&#x27; permission to live a life with her partner. Usually she will elope during the nighttime hours and is awaited by her lover nearby, who then takes her away to a location not of her origin. The next morning, the distraught parents are clueless to the whereabouts of their daughter. &quot;Tanan&quot; often occurs as a result of an impending arranged marriage or in defiance to parents&#x27; dislike of a preferred suitor.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, an elopement is considered as &quot;kawin lari&quot;&quot;, translated as &quot;runaway marriage&quot; (&quot;&quot;kawin&quot;, means marriage, &quot;lari&quot; means running/fleeing). This happens if the groom, the bride or both fail to get parental permission for the marriage. As Indonesia is a religiously strict country, a couple cannot be married without a parent&#x27;s (or next closest living relative) consent. Thus, most Indonesian couples who engage in elopement often end up marrying without acknowledgment or official record by the government.

====Malaysia====
Similar to Indonesia, an elopement in Malaysia is considered as &quot;kahwin lari&quot;&quot; or &quot;marriage on a run&quot;. This mostly occurs when either (or both) of the couple&#x27;s families does not approve the relationship or when the marriage involves a foreign man. Additionally, elopement can happen when the court does not give permission for polygamy or if the man wants to keep the new marriage secret from the first wife or even the existence of the first wife from the second. The eloping couple also may get married outside the border (e.g Pattani) when the dowry amount is too high, causing them to be desperate to run away. Elopement outside the country is valid according to certain law, but failure to register the marriage according to Islamic family law can cause issues with inheritance, performing umrah/hajj, divorce, and the registration of the birth of a child. However, some couples marry out of the country specifically to avoid the registration requirements of their Islamic religious council, which are seen by them as overly complicated.

===West Asia===
In Assyrian society, elopement (&quot;&quot;Jelawta&quot; or &quot;Jenawta&quot;&quot;) against parental request is very disreputable, and is rarely practised. In the 19th and early 20th century, Assyrians had heavily guarded their females from abduction and also consensual elopement, when it came to their neighbours such as Kurds, Azeris and Turks, who would abduct Assyrian women and marry them, in some cases forcefully, where they would convert them to Islam.

Pre-marital romance was tolerated by the Nomadic and Militaristic Kurdish Bolbas tribal confederation, most notability the Mangur tribe; these relationships usually ended up in elopement if not approved for marriage by the bride&#x27;s family. These love marriages were called “&quot;radu khstn&quot;”, meaning &quot;chased after [a person (typically a girl after a boy)].&quot; Typically elopement was only considered honorable if the family of the bride repeatedly rejects the possibility of marriage to her lover until the bride takes it in her own hands and marries her lover herself; otherwise, such as if the bride never mentions a request to marry her lover to her family before eloping with him or in certain families who only approve elopement of divorced women and restrict virgin girls only to arranged marriages, it is considered dishonorable. Many Bolbas women had been in at least one love marriage in their life and it is considered an honor. This caused conflict with the surrounding settled-feudalistic and urbanized fellow Kurdish Mokri tribe, whom measured a woman&#x27;s honor in delicacy and modesty rather than strength and stubbornness, who promoted the ban of this practice. The Mangur tribe were of the last Kurdish tribes to practice this tradition, continuing the practice until the 1980s.

==In popular culture==
The relationship between Helen and Paris of Troy is sometimes depicted as an elopement instead of an abduction.

&quot;Patsy’s Elopement&quot; (1915) was a silent episode of an early serial film that deals with the topic humorously created by the Lubin Manufacturing Company.

Searches for elopement photography ideas on Pinterest increased by 128 percent in 2019, with other related terms like &quot;elopements at city halls&quot; and &quot;elopements in forests&quot; also seeing increases in volume.

In contract bridge, an elopement play is a form of trump coup that enables a smaller card to score a trick if it is lying over the higher card of an opponent. If the rank of the card does not matter, it is known as a &quot;pure&quot; elopement; if the rank does matter it is known as a &quot;rank&quot; elopement.

<text>Amphiptere (also called Amphithere, Amphitere, or Phipthere; meaning bi-winged, two-winged) is a type of winged serpent found in European heraldry.

==Appearance==

Amphipteres generally were said to have light-colored feathers like a sunrise, a serpentine body similar to a lindworm, bat-like wings with feathers covering most of the forearm and often greenish in coloration, and a long tail much like a wyvern&#x27;s tail. Others are described as entirely covered in feathers with a spiked tail, bird-like wings, and a beak-like snout.

==Usage==
Amphipteres saw infrequent use as heraldic devices. Amphipteres are present on the arms of the House of Potier, which depict a bendlet purpure between two amphipteres. The Potier heraldry also uses amphipteres as supporters, as do those of the Duke of Tresmes and Duke of Gesvres.

==Modern fiction==
Amphipteres appear in other modern fictional works.

* The &quot;Dragonology&quot; series of books employ a conceit that dragons are real and that the amphithere is a species that inspired myths about Quetzalcōātl.

* In the &quot;Digimon&quot; franchise, Airdramon is modeled after an amphiptere.

* In the 2021 film &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, Kong fought against Amphiptere-type creatures called &quot;Warbats&quot; in the Hollow Earth.

* In the board game Wyrmspan, a dragon themed card/engine building game based on Wingspan, several playable dragon cards are classified as amphitptere.

<text>Thorkil Vanggaard (1910–1998) was a Danish psychiatrist and doctor.

After becoming an MD in 1938, Vanggaard obtained the higher doctorate in 1941. After the war he studied psychoanalysis in the United States and in 1960 became a senior physician at Rigshospitalet.

Although his critics have called him arrogant and a male chauvinist, fellow psychiatrist Preben Hertoft in his memoirs described both good and bad qualities of Vanggaard.

In the 1970s, he wrote an article called &quot;Eros and Power&quot;, which provoked an outcry from feminists who called for his removal as a senior MD.

In the 80s and 90s, he was critical of the focus on incest, which he saw as a fashion phenomenon, declaring that psychologists and teachers were hypnotized by incest and seeing connections between common mental illnesses and child sexual abuse, where none existed. In the middle of a televised debate, he left the studio, declaring that the debate was frivolous.

Vanggaard introduced the concept of borderline and schizotypal disorders to Denmark.

<text>Sherburne Wesley Burnham (December 12, 1838 – March 11, 1921) was an American astronomer.

For more than 50 years Burnham spent all his free time observing the heavens, mainly concerning himself with binary stars.

==Biography==
Sherburne Wesley Burnham was born in Thetford, Vermont. His parents were Roswell O. Burnham and Marinda (née Foote) Burnham. 

He graduated from the academy in Thetford, and that was the extent of his schooling. He taught himself shorthand, and by 1858 was in New York City.

Burnham was a reporter for the Union Army in New Orleans during the Civil War. While in New Orleans, he bought a copy of a popular book &quot;Geography of the Heavens&quot;, which piqued his interest in astronomy.

After the war, he moved to Chicago and worked as a court reporter for over 20 years. At night Burnham was an amateur astronomer, except for four years (1888–1892) he worked as a professional astronomer at Lick Observatory. He left court reporting in 1902, but remained in Chicago. From 1897–1914 he was an astronomer at Yerkes Observatory.

==Double star discoveries==
During the 1840s it was believed that essentially all the binary stars visible to the instruments then available had been found. Friedrich Struve (catalog abbr. ) and his son Otto Struve (catalog abbr. ) had catalogued a good number of binary stars working at the Dorpat and Pulkovo observatories, using 23 cm and 38 cm telescopes. 

From 1872–1877, with his small telescope, Burnham found 451 new double stars, with the help of a European astronomer, baron Dembowski, who measured exact positions and separations of Burnham’s newly discovered binaries.

In 1873–1874, he produced a catalog of double stars. He became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He continued to identify double stars, and later published the &quot;General Catalogue of 1,290 Double Stars&quot;. In 1906, he published the &quot;Burnham Double Star Catalogue&quot;, containing 13,665 pairs of stars.

The quality of Burnham&#x27;s work opened the doors of observatories for him and he had access to more powerful instruments at Lick, Yerkes, and other observatories. He is credited with having discovered 1,340 binary stars.

Burnham discovered the first example of, what would be called a half century later, a Herbig–Haro object, called Burnham&#x27;s Nebula (now labeled as HH 255).

==Honors==
He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1894. The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Lalande Prize for 1904.

The lunar crater Burnham and asteroid were named in his honour.

<text>The Proclaimers are a Scottish rock duo formed in 1983 by twin brothers Craig and Charlie Reid (born 5 March 1962). They came to attention with their 1987 single &quot;Letter from America&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and the 1988 single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, which topped the charts in Australia, Iceland and New Zealand. The duo&#x27;s biggest album, &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; (1988) has been certified multi-Platinum in Australia and Canada, selling over 2 million copies worldwide, including around 700,000 in the United States. The Proclaimers have sold over 5 million albums worldwide.

First active from 1983 as an acoustic duo, the Proclaimers moved toward band-oriented rock in later works. The Proclaimers&#x27; style draws from a diversity of influences, including country, folk and punk rock. Their playing range has included roots rock, alternative rock and folk rock, and their music is typified by their Scottish accents. The Proclaimers often tour internationally and have released 12 studio albums since 1987, the most recent being 2022&#x27;s &quot;Dentures Out&quot;, as well as three compilation albums and a DVD.

==History==
===Early lives===
Craig Reid and Charles Reid were born in Leith on 5 March 1962 and grew up in Edinburgh, Cornwall and Auchtermuchty. When they lived in Auchtermuchty, they attended Bell Baxter High School.

=== Pre-Proclaimers (1970s–1982) ===
Alluding to the early careers of Craig and Charles Reid in 1989, Bill Wyman of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; commented that the pair &quot;got into music through punk&quot;. After Craig received a beaten-up drum kit and Charlie a guitar, the pair played in punk rock bands named Black Flag, Hippy Hasslers and Reasons for Emotion. Craig Reid, in a 2016 interview with &quot;Esquire Middle East&quot;, relayed that he loved punk acts such as The Clash, The Jam, the Sex Pistols, as well as &quot;all the mid-60s stuff… The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks&quot;.

=== Formation and &quot;This Is the Story&quot; (1983–1987) ===
Becoming aware of the potential of playing as a duo, the Reids established the Proclaimers as an acoustic duo in 1983. Discussing their early sound, actor Peter Mullan said that the Proclaimers played &quot;a mix of post-punk and folk&quot;. During this time, the duo attracted a regional fan-base, with Inverness having an especially dedicated community of supporters. Many of the duo&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Letter from America&quot; which was written in 1984 and reflected unemployment rates of the day, were written in this period.

The Proclaimers recorded a demo album with the assistance of Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners. The demo fell into the hands of English indie pop band the Housemartins, who invited the Proclaimers to support them on their 1986 tour. First opening at the Hummingbird in Birmingham, the tour afforded the duo the opportunity to perform on Channel 4 pop programme &quot;The Tube&quot; in January 1987, and Chrysalis Records quickly signed the pair.

In 1987, the duo&#x27;s John Williams-produced debut record &quot;This Is the Story&quot; was released through Chrysalis, and displayed a minimalist sound lauded by Timothy Monger as &quot;sparse but spirited&quot;. For release as a single, the album-track &quot;Letter from America&quot; was remixed by Gerry Rafferty, embellishing the song with a full-band sound. The single peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, as the duo appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for the first time on 12 December 1987, while the album &quot;This Is the Story&quot; went gold. On their 1987 breakthrough, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; opined that the pair &quot;stuck out like a pair of sore thumbs&quot; amidst the &quot;ersatz glamour of Eighties pop&quot;.

=== &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, &quot;Hit the Highway&quot; and hiatus (1988–2001) ===
The 1988 follow-up album, &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, featured a rock-driven sound as the Proclaimers worked with a band for the first time. Ranging in lyrical-themes from familial joy to Scottish nationalism, the record featured the singles &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, which went to number one in Australia and New Zealand, and &quot;I&#x27;m on My Way&quot;. The album was a particularly big hit in Australia in 1989, being that year&#x27;s 12th biggest-seller, reaching No. 2, and attaining a 2× multi-platinum certification by the ARIA. Craig Reid described this success as their &quot;biggest ever&quot;. Attaining certifications of 2× multi-platinum in Canada, at the time of June 2009 &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; had sold a worldwide total of 2 million copies. The album was a critical success, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in May 1989 lauding it &quot;a wonderfully guileless treasure of an album&quot;.

&quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;&#x27;s following concert tour included a performance at the 1989 Glastonbury Festival, playing to an audience of over 65,000. The Proclaimers had a hit with their EP &quot;King of the Road&quot;, which reached number nine in the UK in 1990. The EP&#x27;s titular song, a Roger Miller cover, was included in the 1990 film &quot;The Crossing&quot;. The Proclaimers appeared on American singer-songwriter Chris Harford&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Be Headed&quot;, performing on the song &quot;Sing, Breathe, and Be Merry&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; belatedly peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1993, after appearing in the movie &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot;, becoming their only chart single in the United States. This popularity saw the Proclaimers supporting American glam metal band Bon Jovi, alongside 10,000 Maniacs, at the Madison Square Garden concert on their I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead Tour. &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; peaked at No. 31, shifting close to 700,000 units in the US by 2001.

The Proclaimers&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Hit the Highway&quot;, was released in 1994. Continuing in the band-oriented rock direction of &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, &quot;Hit the Highway&quot; fell short of previous successes. Irrespective, the record spawned the hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Married&quot;, charting in the United Kingdom, Canada and Austria. The Proclaimers recorded a cover of &quot;Get Ready&quot; by the Temptations for the 1994 screwball comedy film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. Cameron Matthews of &quot;Vice&quot; praised the song &quot;a rocking cover&quot; which gave &quot;a Scottish twist to the ... original&quot;.

In 1994, the Proclaimers appeared at Canadian alternative music festival Edgefest alongside Toad the Wet Sprocket and the Lemonheads. The Proclaimers kept out of the public eye for much of the late 1990s, mainly due to family commitments.

=== Return and subsequent releases (2001–2005) ===
After seven low-profile years, they released their comeback album &quot;Persevere&quot; in 2001. Lauded by Canadian culture publication &quot;Exclaim!&quot; as a &quot;remarkable comeback&quot;, &quot;Persevere&quot; was to-date the only album of theirs to be recorded in the United States, and saw the duo tour North America in support of Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies.

&quot;The Best of The Proclaimers&quot; the duo&#x27;s first greatest hits album, was released on 15 April 2002. The album was hailed by Hal Horowitz as &quot;a near-perfect summary&quot; of their material. Reaching No. 5 and being certified platinum in the UK, the compilation also charted in New Zealand. The Proclaimers&#x27; fifth studio effort, &quot;Born Innocent&quot;, was released in 2003. Their first release on their own label, Persevere Records, the record was hailed as &quot;a return to form&quot; and saw the duo work with Orange Juice frontman Edwyn Collins. &quot;Born Innocent&quot; was ranked at No. 26 for &quot;Mojo Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year&quot;.

&quot;Finest&quot;, the duo&#x27;s second greatest hits album, was also released in 2003. Released through EMI that September, the compilation was received less favorably than its predecessor, but was nonetheless certified silver in the UK.

=== &quot;Restless Soul&quot; and resurgence (2005–2012) ===

The sixth studio effort, &quot;Restless Soul&quot;, was released in 2005. In March 2007 a new version of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, recorded for Comic Relief, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The revival of the hit featured guest vocals from sitcom characters Andy Pipkin (portrayed by Matt Lucas) and Brian Potter (Peter Kay), of &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, respectively.

A seventh studio album, &quot;Life with You&quot;, was released on 3 September 2007 in the UK, and April 2008 in the US. The lead single, &quot;Life with You&quot;, reached No. 58 in the UK, having been the only new Proclaimers single to chart since 1994, while the record itself was their highest-charting in 13 years, peaking at No. 13. &quot;Life with You&quot; enjoyed a generally praising critical reception, with &quot;Boston Globe&quot; praising the record&#x27;s politically edged content, remarking that &quot;the Proclaimers are best when [...] proclaiming&quot;.

&quot;Life with You&quot;&#x27;s US release was promoted by an American tour, including performances in Buffalo, Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and Solana Beach in April and May 2008. &quot;Notes &amp; Rhymes&quot;, the eighth Proclaimers studio album, was released in June 2009 on the W14 label. They signed to Cooking Vinyl thereafter. The European release was on 15 June 2009, with the US release on 11 August 2009. It was simultaneously released as both the standard CD and a &#x27;Special Limited Edition&#x27; 2-CD set, the latter being a double, slimline jewel-case. CD2 has ten tracks: four acoustic and six live. The acoustic tracks were produced by John Williams, who had produced the Proclaimers&#x27; debut album &quot;This Is the Story&quot;. The album, including the bonus CD, was also released as a digital download.

The duo were one of the B-52s&#x27; touring partners on their Funplex tour in Australia and New Zealand in November 2009, alongside Mental as Anything. They featured in VH1&#x27;s 100 greatest one hit wonders, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; having been their only US hit single.

&quot;Like Comedy&quot;, in 2012, was the Proclaimers&#x27; ninth studio effort and their first to be released on Cooking Vinyl records. In its sound a foray into blue-eyed soul, the record enjoyed a &quot;generally favourable reception&quot;. The Proclaimers toured the United States in April 2013, performing as an acoustic duo once again. That summer, the duo toured music festivals in the UK and Canada.

===25th anniversary and further releases (2013–present)===
A third compilation, &quot;The Very Best Of: 25 Years 1987-2012&quot;, was released on 9 July 2013. Peaking at No. 80 on the UK Albums Chart, the compilation was certified gold in the UK in June 2019. In 2014, the &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; track &quot;Cap in Hand&quot;, noted for its nationalist stance, came to prominence in the wake of the Scottish Independence Referendum that September. The song reached No. 6 in Scotland and No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart.

A tenth studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Dogs&quot;, was released in April 2015. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales and produced by Dave Eringa. As stated by member Charlie Reid, the decision to have Eringa produce &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Dogs&quot; was brought about by an admiration for his work with Manic Street Preachers, and on the Johnson and Daltrey album &quot;Going Back Home&quot;.

Their eleventh studio album, &quot;Angry Cyclist&quot;, was released in August 2018. Noted for its political lyrics attacking Brexit and the Trump administration, &quot;Angry Cyclist&quot; attracted a favourable reception, &quot;AllMusic&quot;&#x27;s Marcy Donelson lauding the record &quot;one of [their] best&quot;, and &quot;The Skinny&quot; praising the album-track &quot;Classy&quot; as &quot;lyrical genius&quot;.

During &quot;Angry Cyclist&#x27;s&quot; accompanying promotional tour, they performed in the United Kingdom, Asia, Canada and Australia, to over 400,000 people. The Proclaimers also opened at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival.

In late May 2022, it was revealed on The Proclaimers&#x27; official website that the duo would announce a new studio album on 16 June that year, a date that was later put back until the 30th of that month. On that date, the duo&#x27;s twelfth album &quot;Dentures Out&quot; was announced for release on 16 September 2022. The news came alongside the release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;The World that Was&quot; and the announcement of Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield&#x27;s collaboration on the record.

==Activism==

The Reids are passionate fans of Hibernian and the song &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; has been adopted as an anthem by the club which plays in that part of Edinburgh.
In October 2022, The Proclaimers sponsored the Hibernian Girls Academy Under 12s football team.

The brothers are also well-known supporters of Scottish independence and had been activists for the Scottish National Party, expressing such views during their promotional tour of Britain in March 2007. However, in April 2021, the twins endorsed the Alba Party. The group has also voiced support for Welsh independence.

In 2006, the twins participated in a campaign to free a fellow Scot, Kenny Richey, from his death row sentence in Ohio, United States, including an appearance at a charity concert. In December 2007, Richey accepted a plea bargain, which led to his release from death row and return to Scotland on 9 January 2008. Also, in March 2010 they participated with Billy Bragg in a show at the Electric Palace, Bridport, supporting Reprieve, a charity that seeks to end the use of the death penalty.

==Influences and style==
=== Influences ===
Craig Reid has acknowledged 1970s punk rock as a major influence, citing Buzzcocks, The Clash, The Jam, the Damned and the Sex Pistols as inspirational. On the punk influence, &quot;Stuff New Zealand&quot; remarked that punk bands galvanized the Proclaimers into making &quot;whatever music they liked, in their own way, using their own accents&quot;. Other notable influences were 1960s music, such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Kinks, Van Morrison, Rolling Stones, and 1950s American acts such as Chet Atkins, Ray Charles, Fats Domino, The Everly Brothers, the duo themselves being described as a &quot;post-punk Everly Brothers&quot;, George Jones, Frankie Laine, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Other influences include Dexys Midnight Runners, Joy Division, and Bruce Springsteen.

When exploring lyrical influences in a 2012 interview with &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, the Proclaimers cited Dexys&#x27; Kevin Rowland, The Blockheads&#x27; Ian Dury, Joe Strummer of the Clash, the Smiths vocalist Morrissey and Merle Haggard as their &quot;favourite lyricists&quot;.

=== Style ===
Described by Timothy Monger of &quot;AllMusic&quot; as a &quot;charismatic amalgam&quot;, the Proclaimers&#x27; style of music incorporates elements of country, folk, new wave, pop, punk rock, rock, rockabilly and soul. Stylistically, the Proclaimers have been typified as alternative folk, alternative rock, Celtic pop, country folk, folk rock, post-punk, rhythm and blues, and roots rock.

The vocals in the Proclaimers&#x27; music are characterized by distinct Scottish accents. Describing this to &quot;The Courier&quot; in 2018, Craig Reid commented &quot;it was a conscious thing, because we were singing about where we live, our experiences and it just felt stupid to sing in an English or American accent&quot;.

===Impact and influence===
Many bands and artists have cited the Proclaimers as an influence or inspiration, including the Balconies, Barenaked Ladies, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, the Concretes, Jens Lekman, Sondre Lerche, Lonely Dear, Oppenheimer, Peter Bjorn and John and the Weepies.

Recalling feeling an immediate kinship with the Proclaimers after discovering &quot;This Is the Story&quot;, Steven Page of Barenaked Ladies commented that &quot;[the album] was perfect for us because it was exactly what we were; two guys with acoustic guitars, singing in harmony. It had all the energy of punk rock but just with acoustic guitars and voices&quot;.

Many acts have performed cover versions of Proclaimers songs, including Imagine Dragons, L7, and Todd Rundgren.

&quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, a stage musical spotlighting the songs of The Proclaimers, was named in renown of the group&#x27;s second studio album and its title track. The TMAAward-winning musical debuted in 2007, and the film adaptation, starring Peter Mullan and Jane Horrocks, was completed in 2013, grossing over US$4.7 million after debuting at No. 3 in the UK box office.

The song &quot;Sunshine On Leith&quot; was featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme Soul Music on 15 December 2020.

<text>Frank Brunner (born February 21, 1949) is an American comics artist and illustrator best known for his work at Marvel Comics in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Brunner attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Art and Design. He was in the same graduating class as Larry Hama and Ralph Reese. He studied at the New York University Film School.

==Career==
===Comics===
Brunner entered the comics profession as a horror writer-artist for the black-and-white comics magazines &quot;Web of Horror&quot;, &quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot;, and &quot;Vampirella&quot;. His first work for Marvel Comics was inking an 11-page Watcher backup story in &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; #6 (June 1969). Brunner&#x27;s best-known color-comics work is his Marvel Comics collaboration with writer Steve Engelhart on the supernatural hero Doctor Strange in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #9–14 (July 1973 – March 1974) and in &quot;Doctor Strange: Master of the Mystic Arts&quot; #1–2 and #4–5 (June–August 1974 and Oct.–Dec. 1974). The two killed Dr. Strange&#x27;s mentor, the Ancient One, and Strange became the new Sorcerer Supreme. Englehart and Brunner created a multi-issue storyline in which a sorcerer named Sise-Neg (&quot;Genesis&quot; spelled backward) goes back through history, collecting all magical energies, until he reaches the beginning of the universe, becomes all-powerful and creates it anew, leaving Strange to wonder whether this was, paradoxically, the original creation. Stan Lee, seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but &quot;a&quot; god, so as to avoid offending religious readers. The writer and artist concocted a fake letter from a fictitious minister praising the story, and mailed it to Marvel from Texas; Marvel unwittingly printed the letter, and dropped the retraction order. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart and Brunner&#x27;s run on the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; feature ninth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

Other Marvel credits include Howard the Duck&#x27;s first two solo stories in &quot;Giant-Size Man-Thing&quot; #4 and #5 (May and Aug. 1975) and the first two issues of the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; comic book series (Jan. and March 1976), as well as the anthologies &quot;Chamber of Chills&quot;, &quot;Haunt of Horror&quot;, and &quot;Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction&quot;. He drew covers for the supernatural series &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; and the swamp-monster series &quot;Man-Thing&quot;.

Also for Marvel, Brunner adapted Robert E. Howard&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery pulp fiction hero Conan the Barbarian in the 42-page story &quot;The Scarlet Citadel&quot;, and drew many covers for the similar series &quot;Red Sonja&quot; and &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot;. Brunner left Marvel in 1979 and wrote an essay in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; stating that he &quot;felt the romance with comics was over&quot;.

Brunner and novelist Michael Moorcock collaborated on a comics adaptation of Moorcock&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery hero Elric in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine. It was reprinted in publisher Mike Friedrich&#x27;s &quot;Star Reach Greatest Hits&quot;.

Brunner briefly returned to comics in the early-1980s as artist on the First Comics title &quot;Warp!&quot;, based on the science fiction play that ran briefly on Broadway in the 1970s. He then wrote and drew the graphic novel &quot;The Seven Samuroid&quot; (1984), a science-fiction takeoff of the movie classic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.

===Film and television===
Brunner moved to Hollywood and began a career in movie and television animation, working on projects for Hanna-Barbera (&quot;Jonny Quest&quot;), Walt Disney Imagineering (Euro &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; movie), Warner Bros. (preproduction &quot;Batman&quot; design) and DreamWorks (&quot;Invasion USA&quot;). He was the head of character design for the Fox animated series &quot;X-Men&quot;.

<text>A rookery is a colony breeding rooks, and more broadly a colony of several types of breeding animals, generally gregarious birds.

Coming from the nesting habits of rooks, the term is used for corvids and the breeding grounds of colony-forming seabirds, marine mammals (true seals or sea lions), and even some turtles. Rooks (northern-European and central-Asian members of the crow family) have multiple nests in prominent colonies at the tops of trees. Paleontological evidence points to the existence of rookery-like colonies in the pterosaur &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;.

The term &quot;rookery&quot; was also borrowed as a name for dense slum housing in nineteenth-century cities, especially in London.

<doc id="619053" wikidata="Q4053284" url="?curid=619053" title="Distributed transaction">
<text>A distributed transaction operates within a distributed environment, typically involving multiple nodes across a network depending on the location of the data. A key aspect of distributed transactions is atomicity, which ensures that the transaction is completed in its entirety or not executed at all. It&#x27;s essential to note that distributed transactions are not limited to databases. 

The Open Group, a vendor consortium, proposed the X/Open Distributed Transaction Processing Model (X/Open XA), which became a de facto standard for the behavior of transaction model components.

Databases are common transactional resources and, often, transactions span a couple of such databases. In this case, a distributed transaction can be seen as a database transaction that must be synchronized (or provide ACID properties) among multiple participating databases which are distributed among different physical locations. The isolation property (the I of ACID) poses a special challenge for multi database transactions, since the (global) serializability property could be violated, even if each database provides it (see also global serializability). In practice most commercial database systems use strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL) for concurrency control, which ensures global serializability, if all the participating databases employ it.

A common algorithm for ensuring correct completion of a distributed transaction is the two-phase commit (2PC). This algorithm is usually applied for updates able to commit in a short period of time, ranging from couple of milliseconds to couple of minutes.

There are also long-lived distributed transactions, for example a transaction to book a trip, which consists of booking a flight, a rental car and a hotel. Since booking the flight might take up to a day to get a confirmation, two-phase commit is not applicable here, it will lock the resources for this long. In this case more sophisticated techniques that involve multiple undo levels are used. The way you can undo the hotel booking by calling a desk and cancelling the reservation, a system can be designed to undo certain operations (unless they are irreversibly finished).

In practice, long-lived distributed transactions are implemented in systems based on web services. Usually these transactions utilize principles of compensating transactions, Optimism and Isolation Without Locking. The X/Open standard does not cover long-lived distributed transactions.

Several technologies, including Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Microsoft Transaction Server fully support distributed transaction standards.

== Synchronization ==
In event-driven architectures, distributed transactions can be synchronized through using request–response paradigm and it can be implemented in two ways: 

* Creating two separate queues: one for requests and the other for replies. The event producer must wait until it receives the response.
* Creating one dedicated ephemeral queue for each request.

<doc id="619055" wikidata="Q1297994" url="?curid=619055" title="Book of Concord">
<text>The Book of Concord (1580) or Concordia (often referred to as the Lutheran Confessions) is the historic doctrinal standard of the Lutheran Church, consisting of ten credal documents recognized as authoritative in Lutheranism since the 16th century. They are also known as the symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.

&quot;The Book of Concord&quot; was published in German on June 25, 1580, in Dresden, the fiftieth anniversary of the presentation of the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; to Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Augsburg. The authoritative Latin edition was published in 1584 in Leipzig.

Those who accept it as their doctrinal standard recognize it to be a faithful exposition of the Bible. The Holy Scriptures are set forth in &quot;The Book of Concord&quot; to be the sole, divine source and norm of all Christian doctrine.

==Origin and arrangement==
&quot;The Book of Concord&quot; was compiled by a group of theologians led by Jakob Andreae and Martin Chemnitz at the behest of their rulers, who desired an end to the religious controversies in their territories that arose among Lutherans after the death of Martin Luther in 1546. It was intended to replace German territorial collections of doctrinal statements, known as &quot;corpora doctrinæ&quot; (bodies of doctrine) like the &quot;Corpus doctrinæ Philippicum&quot; or &quot;Misnicum&quot;. This aim is reflected by the compilers&#x27; not calling it a &quot;corpus doctrinæ&quot; although it technically is one. The list of writings predating the &quot;Formula of Concord&quot; that would be included in &quot;The Book of Concord&quot; are listed and described in the &quot;Rule and Norm&quot; section of the &quot;Formula&quot;.

Following the preface written by Andreae and Chemnitz (1578–80) the &quot;Three Ecumenical Creeds&quot; were placed at the beginning in order to show the identity of Lutheran teaching with that of the ancient Christian church. These creeds, the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed, were formulated before the East-West Schism of 1054, but the Nicene Creed is the western version containing the filioque.

The other documents come from the earliest years of the Lutheran Reformation (1529–77). They are the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot;, the &quot;Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;, both by Philipp Melanchthon, the &quot;Small&quot; and &quot;Large Catechisms&quot; of Martin Luther, his &quot;Smalcald Articles&quot;, Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope&quot;, and the &quot;Formula of Concord&quot;, which was composed shortly before the publishing of the Book of Concord and intended for the same purpose: the pacification and unification of the growing Lutheran movement. The preface of the Book of Concord was considered to be the preface of the &quot;Formula of Concord&quot; as well.

The &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; has singular importance A recent book on Lutheranism asserts, &quot;To this day ... the Augsburg Confession ... remains the basic definition of what it means to be a &#x27;Lutheran.&#x27;&quot;&quot;The Apology&quot;, the &quot;Smalcald Articles&quot;, the &quot;Treatise&quot;, and the &quot;Formula of Concord&quot; explain, defend, or serve as addenda to &quot;The Augsburg Confession.&quot;

==Context in Christendom==
The simple Latin title of the Book of Concord, &quot;Concordia&quot;, (Latin for &quot;an agreeing together&quot;) is fitting for the character of its contents: Christian statements of faith setting forth what is believed, taught, and confessed by the confessors &quot;with one heart and voice.&quot; This follows St. Paul&#x27;s directive: &quot;that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.&quot; (1 Cor. 1:10; NKJV). The creeds and confessions that constitute the Book of Concord are not the private writings of their various authors:
==Contemporary subscription==

To this day the Book of Concord is doctrinally normative among traditional and conservative Lutheran churches, which require their pastors and other rostered church workers to pledge themselves unconditionally to the Book of Concord. They often identify themselves as &quot;confessional Lutherans&quot;. They consider the Book of Concord the &quot;norma normata&quot; (Latin, &quot;the normed norm&quot;) in relation to the Bible, which they consider the &quot;norma normans&quot; (Latin, &quot;the norming norm&quot;), i.e. the only source of Christian doctrine (God&#x27;s authoritative word). In this view the Book of Concord, on the topics that it addresses, is what the church authoritatively understands God&#x27;s authoritative word to say. This is also called a &quot;&quot;quia&quot; (because) subscription to the Lutheran confessions, i.e. one subscribes &quot;because&quot; the Book of Concord is a faithful exposition of the Scriptures.

It implies that the subscriber has examined the Lutheran confessions in the light of the Scriptures in order to arrive at this position, which in the subscriber&#x27;s view does not require the disclaimer implied in a &quot;quatenus&quot;&quot; (insofar as) subscription. One who subscribes the Lutheran confessions &quot;quatenus&quot;, insofar as they are a faithful exposition of the Scriptures, believes that there might be contradictions of the Scriptures in them. In some cases this is the manner of subscription of some other Lutheran churches, which regard the Book of Concord as an important witness and guide to the historical teachings of the Lutheran Church although not necessarily doctrinally binding.

==English translations==
English translations of individual documents of &quot;The Book of Concord&quot;, notably &quot;The Augsburg Confession&quot;, were available since the 16th century. The first complete English translation of &quot;The Book of Concord&quot; was the 1851 Henkel edition followed by a second edition in 1854. These volumes included historical introductions.

Henry E. Jacobs and others published the next English version in 1882 with a revised &quot;People&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 1911. The 1882 edition was accompanied by a companion volume that contained historical introductions and English translations of other documents illustrative of the history of &quot;The Book of Concord&quot;.

The third complete English translation was published in 1921 as a jubilee observance of the 400th anniversary of the Reformation (1917) along with the German and Latin texts as the &quot;Concordia Triglotta: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church, German-Latin English&quot; edited by Friederich Bente. This edition introduced the practice of inserting in square brackets the translations of variant readings of either the Latin translation of the German or the German translation of the Latin text. A smaller edition with just the English text was also published.

The differences of the German translation of &quot;The Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot; from the original Latin text were made apparent by Bente&#x27;s insertion within square brackets of the variant readings of his English translation of the German text into the main body of his translation of the original Latin text. Justus Jonas, who had originally translated the &quot;Apology&quot; from Latin into German, made use of both the quarto and the octavo editions. The other reason for the differences is the &quot;looseness&quot; of the Jonas translation that is more like a paraphrase than a translation.

With the appearance of the 1930 &quot;Bekenntnisschriften&quot; critical text a new English version was deemed desirable. This was begun but left unfinished by John C. Mattes, who died in 1948. In 1959, the &quot;Tappert&quot; edition was produced, with Theodore G. Tappert as general editor and translator and with Jaroslav Pelikan, Robert H. Fisher, and Arthur Carl Piepkorn as additional translators. This edition discontinued the practice of inserting translations of variant readings in square brackets. However, it began the practice of providing the translations of both the German and Latin texts of the Augsburg Confession since both texts of that confession are considered authoritative. The manner of presentation was the translation of the German text on the top of the page, that of the Latin on the bottom.

An extensive revision of the Tappert edition was published in 2000, translated and edited by Robert Kolb and Timothy J. Wengert. As with the Tappert edition, the &quot;Kolb-Wengert Edition&quot; was translated by scholars from two different Lutheran denominations (Kolb of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and Wengert of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America). This edition provided the translations of both German and Latin texts of the Augsburg Confession on alternating pages. The translation team also included Eric Gritsch, Charles Arand, William Russell, James Schaaf, and Jane Strohl.

The Kolb-Wengert edition exhibits one of the difficulties in the translation of &quot;The Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;. Two editions of &quot;The Apology&quot; were published in 1531, namely, the &quot;quarto edition&quot; and the &quot;octavo edition&quot;, which are so designated based on the format in which they were printed. The quarto edition was printed with the first publication of &quot;The Augsburg Confession&quot; in April or May 1531; hence, the name &quot;editio princeps&quot; [&quot;first edition&quot;]. The octavo edition followed in September, 1531.

The Kolb-Wengert translation of &quot;The Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot; uses the later octavo edition text of 1531 rather than the earlier quarto edition text of 1531, with the variant readings of the quarto edition appearing in italics. The Tappert edition had used the quarto edition as the basis of its translation. The editors and translators of the Kolb-Wengert edition decided to use the octavo edition as the main source for their translation because they believed the octavo edition was the official text of &quot;The Apology&quot;. This is the position of the German scholar Christian Peters, who claimed the quarto edition was merely a stage on the way to a definitive text, i.e. the octavo edition.

The octavo edition Latin text was utilized in a private Latin edition of &quot;The Book of Concord&quot; in 1580. Scholars question whether or not this octavo edition text can be considered the text approved by the Lutheran Church in the 16th century. The official 1584 Latin &quot;Book of Concord&quot; has the quarto edition text as its text of &quot;The Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;. Another notable feature of the Kolb-Wengert edition is the setting off of &quot;the filioque&quot; of the Nicene Creed in square brackets.

The most recent English version of the Book of Concord was published in 2005 to commemorate the 425th anniversary of its publication and the 475th anniversary of the presentation of &quot;The Augsburg Confession.&quot; Entitled &quot;Concordia: The Lutheran Confessions—A Reader&#x27;s Edition of the Book of Concord&quot;, it is a revision of the English text of the &quot;Concordia Triglotta&quot; and was edited by Paul T. McCain, Edward A. Engelbrecht, Robert C. Baker, and Gene E. Veith. A second edition followed in 2006.

<doc id="619057" wikidata="Q1889385" url="?curid=619057" title="Pan Sonic">
<text>Pan Sonic was a Finnish electronic music group founded in Turku in 1993. The group consisted of Mika Vainio, Ilpo Väisänen, and Sami Salo. Salo left in 1996 leaving Pan Sonic a duo. The group was originally named Panasonic until 1998. In December 2009, it was announced that Pan Sonic would disband after their concerts that month. Their final album, &quot;Gravitoni&quot;, was released by Blast First Petite in May 2010. &quot;Oksastus&quot;, a live album recorded in 2009, was released in 2014.

==Music==
Pan Sonic cite their main influences from the early 1980s, with industrial acts like Throbbing Gristle, Einstürzende Neubauten and Suicide to reggae, hip-hop and dub. Vainio often remarks that their music is a merger of these two schools of music, taking the harsh and pure sounds typical of industrial techno and spacing them out into longer, subdued soundscapes familiar to instrumental reggae and dub. The late outsider rockabilly artist Hasil Adkins is also cited, as well as country music star Johnny Cash.

Some of their equipment is made by third &quot;extra&quot; member Jari Lehtinen. These and other custom made instruments are responsible for creating the sounds typical to Pan Sonic&#x27;s music. They also use samplers and an MPC2000 sequencer. Pan Sonic are great fans of experimentation and art performances and have done exhibitions and sound installations in museums. They have also made music for Rei Kawakubo&#x27;s fashion shows. The group was known for recording everything live, straight to DAT using home-made and modified synthesizers and effect units.

In the late 1980s, as part of a &quot;sound performance&quot;, the duo spent 10 hours in a garage, exposed to low-frequency (13 Hz) noise at 125 decibels. They performed a gig in London&#x27;s East End from an armoured car using a 5000 watt sound system allegedly &quot;similar&quot; to the type used by the police to disorient rioters.

==History==
Pan Sonic formed in 1993 as a techno group with member Sami Salo (who later left the group). They moved to operate from a base in Barcelona to escape the long Finnish winters. Mika Vainio later moved to Berlin, while Ilpo Väisänen returned to Kuopio. Their first 12&quot; was released on Finland&#x27;s Sähkö Recordings.

Originally, the band was called Panasonic, but the corporation of the same name threatened legal action unless it was changed. The conflict was resolved, and the duo removed the &quot;a&quot; from their name to become &quot;Pan Sonic&quot;, which was used as the title of their 1999 album &quot;A&quot;.

In December 2009 news of the duo splitting was announced on PhinnWeb – with Mika and Ilpo continuing with their own solo projects. In October 2013 a new Pan Sonic album titled &quot;Oksastus&quot; was announced. It is a live album recorded at a concert in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 6, 2009. It was released on February 20, 2014.

Pan Sonic created a soundtrack for the 2015 documentary called &quot;Return of the Atom&quot; directed by Mika Taanila and Jussi Eerola. The film examines the construction of the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant in Finland. &quot;Return of the Atom&quot; premiered in Toronto International Film Festival in 2015.

Mika Vainio died on April 13, 2017, at the age of 53.

<doc id="619064" wikidata="Q2902757" url="?curid=619064" title="G0 phase">
<text>The G0 phase describes a cellular state outside of the replicative cell cycle. Classically, cells were thought to enter G0 primarily due to environmental factors, like nutrient deprivation, that limited the resources necessary for proliferation. Thus it was thought of as a resting phase. G0 is now known to take different forms and occur for multiple reasons. For example, most adult neuronal cells, among the most metabolically active cells in the body, are fully differentiated and reside in a terminal G0 phase. Neurons reside in this state, not because of stochastic or limited nutrient supply, but as a part of their developmental program.

G0 was first suggested as a cell state based on early cell cycle studies. When the first studies defined the four phases of the cell cycle using radioactive labeling techniques, it was discovered that not all cells in a population proliferate at similar rates. A population&#x27;s &quot;growth fraction&quot; – or the fraction of the population that was growing – was actively proliferating, but other cells existed in a non-proliferative state. Some of these non-proliferating cells could respond to extrinsic stimuli and proliferate by re-entering the cell cycle. Early contrasting views either considered non-proliferating cells to simply be in an extended G1 phase or in a cell cycle phase distinct from G1 – termed G0. Subsequent research pointed to a restriction point (R-point) in G1 where cells can enter G0 before the R-point but are committed to mitosis after the R-point. These early studies provided evidence for the existence of a G0 state to which access is restricted. These cells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage called quiescent stage.

==Diversity of G0 states==

Three G0 states exist and can be categorized as either reversible () or irreversible (senescent and differentiated). Each of these three states can be entered from the G1 phase before the cell commits to the next round of the cell cycle. Quiescence refers to a reversible G0 state where subpopulations of cells reside in a &#x27;quiescent&#x27; state before entering the cell cycle after activation in response to extrinsic signals. Quiescent cells are often identified by low RNA content, lack of cell proliferation markers, and increased label retention indicating low cell turnover. Senescence is distinct from quiescence because senescence is an irreversible state that cells enter in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell&#x27;s progeny nonviable. Such DNA damage can occur from telomere shortening over many cell divisions as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure, oncogene activation, and cell-cell fusion. While senescent cells can no longer replicate, they remain able to perform many normal cellular functions. Senescence is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis. In contrast to cellular senescence, quiescence is not a reactive event but part of the core programming of several different cell types. Finally, differentiated cells are stem cells that have progressed through a differentiation program to reach a mature – terminally differentiated – state. Differentiated cells continue to stay in G0 and perform their main functions indefinitely.

==Characteristics of quiescent stem cells==
===Transcriptomes===
The transcriptomes of several types of quiescent stem cells, such as hematopoietic, muscle, and hair follicle, have been characterized through high-throughput techniques, such as microarray and RNA sequencing. Although variations exist in their individual transcriptomes, most quiescent tissue stem cells share a common pattern of gene expression that involves downregulation of cell cycle progression genes, such as cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E2, and survivin, and upregulation of genes involved in the regulation of transcription and stem cell fate, such as FOXO3 and EZH1. Downregulation of mitochondrial cytochrome C also reflects the low metabolic state of quiescent stem cells.

===Epigenetic===
Many quiescent stem cells, particularly adult stem cells, also share similar epigenetic patterns. For example, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, are two major histone methylation patterns that form a bivalent domain and are located near transcription initiation sites. These epigenetic markers have been found to regulate lineage decisions in embryonic stem cells as well as control quiescence in hair follicle and muscle stem cells via chromatin modification.

== Regulation of quiescence ==

=== Cell cycle regulators ===
Functional tumor suppressor genes, particularly p53 and Rb gene, are required to maintain stem cell quiescence and prevent exhaustion of the progenitor cell pool through excessive divisions. For example, deletion of all three components of the Rb family of proteins has been shown to halt quiescence in hematopoietic stem cells. Lack of p53 has been shown to prevent differentiation of these stem cells due to the cells&#x27; inability to exit the cell cycle into the G0 phase. In addition to p53 and Rb, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), such as p21, p27, and p57, are also important for maintaining quiescence. In mouse hematopoietic stem cells, knockout of p57 and p27 leads to G0 exit through nuclear import of cyclin D1 and subsequent phosphorylation of Rb. Finally, the Notch signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in maintenance of quiescence.

===Post-transcriptional regulation===
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via miRNA synthesis has been shown to play an equally important role in the maintenance of stem cell quiescence. miRNA strands bind to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs, preventing their translation into functional proteins. The length of the 3′ UTR of a gene determines its ability to bind to miRNA strands, thereby allowing regulation of quiescence. Some examples of miRNA&#x27;s in stem cells include miR-126, which controls the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in hematopoietic stem cells, miR-489, which suppresses the DEK oncogene in muscle stem cells, and miR-31, which regulates Myf5 in muscle stem cells. miRNA sequestration of mRNA within ribonucleoprotein complexes allows quiescent cells to store the mRNA necessary for quick entry into the G1 phase.

=== Response to stress ===
Stem cells that have been quiescent for a long time often face various environmental stressors, such as oxidative stress. However, several mechanisms allow these cells to respond to such stressors. For example, the FOXO transcription factors respond to the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while HIF1A and LKB1 respond to hypoxic conditions. In hematopoietic stem cells, autophagy is induced to respond to metabolic stress.

==Examples of reversible G0 phase==
===Tissue stem cells===
Stem cells are cells with the unique ability to produce differentiated daughter cells and to preserve their stem cell identity through self-renewal.
In mammals, most adult tissues contain tissue-specific stem cells that reside in the tissue and proliferate to maintain homeostasis for the lifespan of the organism. These cells can undergo immense proliferation in response to tissue damage before differentiating and engaging in regeneration. Some tissue stem cells exist in a reversible, quiescent state indefinitely until being activated by external stimuli. Many different types of tissue stem cells exist, including muscle stem cells (MuSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and many others.

Stem cell quiescence has been recently suggested to be composed of two distinct functional phases, G0 and an &#x27;alert&#x27; phase termed GAlert.
Stem cells are believed to actively and reversibly transition between these phases to respond to injury stimuli and seem to gain enhanced tissue regenerative function in GAlert. Thus, transition into GAlert has been proposed as an adaptive response that enables stem cells to rapidly respond to injury or stress by priming them for cell cycle entry. In muscle stem cells, mTORC1 activity has been identified to control the transition from G0 into GAlert along with signaling through the HGF receptor cMet.

===Mature hepatocytes===
While a reversible quiescent state is perhaps most important for tissue stem cells to respond quickly to stimuli and maintain proper homeostasis and regeneration, reversible G0 phases can be found in non-stem cells such as mature hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are typically quiescent in normal livers but undergo limited replication (less than 2 cell divisions) during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. However, in certain cases, hepatocytes can experience immense proliferation (more than 70 cell divisions) indicating that their proliferation capacity is not hampered by existing in a reversible quiescent state.

==Examples of irreversible G0 phase==
===Senescent cells===
Often associated with aging and age-related diseases in vivo, senescent cells can be found in many renewable tissues, including the stroma, vasculature, hematopoietic system, and many epithelial organs. Resulting from accumulation over many cell divisions, senescence is often seen in age-associated degenerative phenotypes. Senescent fibroblasts in models of breast epithelial cell function have been found to disrupt milk protein production due to secretion of matrix metalloproteinases.
Similarly, senescent pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells caused nearby smooth muscle cells to proliferate and migrate, perhaps contributing to hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries and eventually pulmonary hypertension.

===Differentiated muscle===
During skeletal myogenesis, cycling progenitor cells known as myoblasts differentiate and fuse together into non-cycling muscle cells called myocytes that remain in a terminal G0 phase. As a result, the fibers that make up skeletal muscle (myofibers) are cells with multiple nuclei, referred to as myonuclei, since each myonucleus originated from a single myoblast. Skeletal muscle cells continue indefinitely to provide contractile force through simultaneous contractions of cellular structures called sarcomeres. Importantly, these cells are kept in a terminal G0 phase since disruption of muscle fiber structure after myofiber formation would prevent proper transmission of force through the length of the muscle. Muscle growth can be stimulated by growth or injury and involves the recruitment of muscle stem cells – also known as satellite cells – out of a reversible quiescent state. These stem cells differentiate and fuse to generate new muscle fibers both in parallel and in series to increase force generation capacity.

Cardiac muscle is also formed through myogenesis but instead of recruiting stem cells to fuse and form new cells, heart muscle cells – known as cardiomyocytes – simply increase in size as the heart grows larger. Similarly to skeletal muscle, if cardiomyocytes had to continue dividing to add muscle tissue the contractile structures necessary for heart function would be disrupted.

===Differentiated bone===
Of the four major types of bone cells, osteocytes are the most common and also exist in a terminal G0 phase. Osteocytes arise from osteoblasts that are trapped within a self-secreted matrix. While osteocytes also have reduced synthetic activity, they still serve bone functions besides generating structure. Osteocytes work through various mechanosensory mechanisms to assist in the routine turnover over bony matrix.

===Differentiated nerve===
Outside of a few neurogenic niches in the brain, most neurons are fully differentiated and reside in a terminal G0 phase. These fully differentiated neurons form synapses where electrical signals are transmitted by axons to the dendrites of nearby neurons. In this G0 state, neurons continue functioning until senescence or apoptosis. Numerous studies have reported accumulation of DNA damage with age, particularly oxidative damage, in the mammalian brain.

== Mechanism of G0 entry ==

=== Role of Rim15 ===
Rim15 was first discovered to play a critical role in initiating meiosis in diploid yeast cells. Under conditions of low glucose and nitrogen, which are key nutrients for the survival of yeast, diploid yeast cells initiate meiosis through the activation of early meiotic-specific genes (EMGs). The expression of EMGs is regulated by Ume6. Ume6 recruits the histone deacetylases, Rpd3 and Sin3, to repress EMG expression when glucose and nitrogen levels are high, and it recruits the EMG transcription factor Ime1 when glucose and nitrogen levels are low. Rim15, named for its role in the regulation of an EMG called IME2, displaces Rpd3 and Sin3, thereby allowing Ume6 to bring Ime1 to the promoters of EMGs for meiosis initiation.

In addition to playing a role in meiosis initiation, Rim15 has also been shown to be a critical effector for yeast cell entry into G0 in the presence of stress. Signals from several different nutrient signaling pathways converge on Rim15, which activates the transcription factors, Gis1, Msn2, and Msn4. Gis1 binds to and activates promoters containing post-diauxic growth shift (PDS) elements while Msn2 and Msn4 bind to and activate promoters containing stress-response elements (STREs). Although it is not clear how Rim15 activates Gis1 and Msn2/4, there is some speculation that it may directly phosphorylate them or be involved in chromatin remodeling. Rim15 has also been found to contain a PAS domain at its N terminal, making it a newly discovered member of the PAS kinase family. The PAS domain is a regulatory unit of the Rim15 protein that may play a role in sensing oxidative stress in yeast.

=== Nutrient signaling pathways ===

====Glucose====
Yeast grows exponentially through fermentation of glucose. When glucose levels drop, yeast shift from fermentation to cellular respiration, metabolizing the fermentative products from their exponential growth phase. This shift is known as the diauxic shift after which yeast enter G0. When glucose levels in the surroundings are high, the production of cAMP through the RAS-cAMP-PKA pathway (a cAMP-dependent pathway) is elevated, causing protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit its downstream target Rim15 and allow cell proliferation. When glucose levels drop, cAMP production declines, lifting PKA&#x27;s inhibition of Rim15 and allowing the yeast cell to enter G0.

====Nitrogen====
In addition to glucose, the presence of nitrogen is crucial for yeast proliferation. Under low nitrogen conditions, Rim15 is activated to promote cell cycle arrest through inactivation of the protein kinases TORC1 and Sch9. While TORC1 and Sch9 belong to two separate pathways, namely the TOR and Fermentable Growth Medium induced pathways respectively, both protein kinases act to promote cytoplasmic retention of Rim15. Under normal conditions, Rim15 is anchored to the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 protein, Bmh2, via phosphorylation of its Thr1075. TORC1 inactivates certain phosphatases in the cytoplasm, keeping Rim15 anchored to Bmh2, while it is thought that Sch9 promotes Rim15 cytoplasmic retention through phosphorylation of another 14-3-3 binding site close to Thr1075. When extracellular nitrogen is low, TORC1 and Sch9 are inactivated, allowing dephosphorylation of Rim15 and its subsequent transport to the nucleus, where it can activate transcription factors involved in promoting cell entry into G0. It has also been found that Rim15 promotes its own export from the nucleus through autophosphorylation.

====Phosphate====
Yeast cells respond to low extracellular phosphate levels by activating genes that are involved in the production and upregulation of inorganic phosphate. The PHO pathway is involved in the regulation of phosphate levels. Under normal conditions, the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase complex, Pho80-Pho85, inactivates the Pho4 transcription factor through phosphorylation. However, when phosphate levels drop, Pho81 inhibits Pho80-Pho85, allowing Pho4 to be active. When phosphate is abundant, Pho80-Pho85 also inhibits the nuclear pool of Rim 15 by promoting phosphorylation of its Thr1075 Bmh2 binding site. Thus, Pho80-Pho85 acts in concert with Sch9 and TORC1 to promote cytoplasmic retention of Rim15 under normal conditions.

== Mechanism of G0 exit ==

===Cyclin C/Cdk3 and Rb===
The transition from G1 to S phase is promoted by the inactivation of Rb through its progressive hyperphosphorylation by the Cyclin D/Cdk4 and Cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes in late G1. An early observation that loss of Rb promoted cell cycle re-entry in G0 cells suggested that Rb is also essential in regulating the G0 to G1 transition in quiescent cells. Further observations revealed that levels of cyclin C mRNA are highest when human cells exit G0, suggesting that cyclin C may be involved in Rb phosphorylation to promote cell cycle re-entry of G0 arrested cells. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays revealed that cyclin C has Rb kinase activity. Furthermore, unlike cyclins D and E, cyclin C&#x27;s Rb kinase activity is highest during early G1 and lowest during late G1 and S phases, suggesting that it may be involved in the G0 to G1 transition. The use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting to identify G0 cells, which are characterized by a high DNA to RNA ratio relative to G1 cells, confirmed the suspicion that cyclin C promotes G0 exit as repression of endogenous cyclin C by RNAi in mammalian cells increased the proportion of cells arrested in G0. Further experiments involving mutation of Rb at specific phosphorylation sites showed that cyclin C phosphorylation of Rb at S807/811 is necessary for G0 exit. It remains unclear, however, whether this phosphorylation pattern is sufficient for G0 exit. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (cdk3) promotes G0 exit by forming a complex with cyclin C to phosphorylate Rb at S807/811. Interestingly, S807/811 are also targets of cyclin D/cdk4 phosphorylation during the G1 to S transition. This might suggest a possible compensation of cdk3 activity by cdk4, especially in light of the observation that G0 exit is only delayed, and not permanently inhibited, in cells lacking cdk3 but functional in cdk4. Despite the overlap of phosphorylation targets, it seems that cdk3 is still necessary for the most effective transition from G0 to G1.

===Rb and G0 exit===
Studies suggest that Rb repression of the E2F family of transcription factors regulates the G0 to G1 transition just as it does the G1 to S transition. Activating E2F complexes are associated with the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases, which activate gene expression necessary for G1 entry, while E2F4 complexes recruit histone deacetylases, which repress gene expression. Phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk complexes allows its dissociation from E2F transcription factors and the subsequent expression of genes necessary for G0 exit. Other members of the Rb pocket protein family, such as p107 and p130, have also been found to be involved in G0 arrest. p130 levels are elevated in G0 and have been found to associate with E2F-4 complexes to repress transcription of E2F target genes. Meanwhile, p107 has been found to rescue the cell arrest phenotype after loss of Rb even though p107 is expressed at comparatively low levels in G0 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Rb repression of E2F transcription factors promotes cell arrest while phosphorylation of Rb leads to G0 exit via derepression of E2F target genes. In addition to its regulation of E2F, Rb has also been shown to suppress RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III, which are involved in rRNA synthesis. Thus, phosphorylation of Rb also allows activation of rRNA synthesis, which is crucial for protein synthesis upon entry into G1.

<text>Bruce Randall Hornsby (born November 23, 1954) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. His music draws from folk rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, Southern rock, country rock, jam band, rock, heartland rock, and blues rock musical traditions.

Hornsby has won three Grammy Awards: a 1987 Grammy Award for Best New Artist with Bruce Hornsby and the Range, a 1990 Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Recording, and a 1994 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

Hornsby has worked with his touring band Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs, and as a session and guest musician. He was a touring member of the Grateful Dead from September 1990 through March 1992, playing over 100 shows with the band.

His 23rd album, &quot;Flicted&quot;, was released in May 2022.

==Early life and education==
Bruce Randall Hornsby was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, to Robert Stanley Hornsby (1920–1998), an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and Lois (née Saunier), a piano player and church community liaison who had a local middle school named after her. He has two brothers, Robert Saunier &quot;Bobby&quot; Hornsby, a realtor with Hornsby Realty and locally known musician, and John Hornsby, an engineer with whom he has collaborated in songwriting. They are cousins of actor David Hornsby. While raised in the church of Christian Science, Hornsby went to doctors and dentists as needed. He had a politically liberal upbringing.

Hornsby graduated from James Blair High School in Williamsburg in 1973, where he played on the basketball team and was chosen by his senior class as most likely to succeed.

He studied music at the University of Richmond for a year, at the Berklee College of Music for two semesters, and then at the University of Miami, where he graduated in 1977.

==Career==
In 1974, Hornsby&#x27;s older brother Bobby, who attended the University of Virginia, formed the band &quot;Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids&quot; to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals. The band, which is listed in &quot;Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads&quot;, performed covers of Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and predominantly Grateful Dead songs.

Bobby Hornsby&#x27;s son, Robert Saunier Hornsby, was a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby&#x27;s band and periodically toured with his uncle until his death on January 15, 2009, in a car accident near Crozet, Virginia at age 28.

Following his graduation from the University of Miami in 1977, Hornsby returned to his hometown of Williamsburg, and played in local clubs and hotel bars. In 1980, he and his younger brother and songwriting partner John Hornsby moved to Los Angeles, where they spent three years writing for 20th Century Fox. Before moving back to his native Hampton Roads, he also spent time in Los Angeles as a session musician. In 1982, Hornsby joined the band Ambrosia for their last album &quot;Road Island&quot; and can be seen in the band&#x27;s video for the album&#x27;s single &quot;How Can You Love Me&quot;. After Ambrosia disbanded, he and bassist Joe Puerta performed as members of the touring band for Sheena Easton. In 1984, Hornsby appeared in the music video for Easton&#x27;s single &quot;Strut&quot;.

Hornsby made a solo demo recording of “Mandolin Rain,” “The Way It Is,” and “The Red Plains” which led to him being signed by RCA in 1985.

===The Range===
In 1984, Hornsby formed Bruce Hornsby and the Range, who were signed to RCA Records in 1985. Besides Hornsby, Range members were David Mansfield (guitar, mandolin, violin), George Marinelli (guitars and backing vocals), former Ambrosia member Joe Puerta (bass guitar and backing vocals), and John Molo (drums).

Hornsby&#x27;s recording career started with the biggest hit he has had to date, &quot;The Way It Is&quot;. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1986. The song described aspects of homelessness, the American civil rights movement and institutional racism. It has since been sampled by at least six rap artists, including Tupac Shakur, E-40, and Mase.

With the success of the single, the album &quot;The Way It Is&quot; received the RIAA certification of multi-platinum. It included &quot;Mandolin Rain&quot; (co-written, as many of Hornsby&#x27;s early songs were, with his brother John), another top-five hit. &quot;Every Little Kiss&quot; peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1987. Other tracks on the album helped establish what some labeled the &quot;Virginia sound&quot;, a mixture of rock, jazz, and bluegrass. Bruce Hornsby and the Range won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1987, beating out Glass Tiger, Nu Shooz, Simply Red, and Timbuk3.

Hornsby and the Range&#x27;s sound was distinctive for its use of syncopation in Hornsby&#x27;s piano solos, a bright piano sound and an extensive use of synthesizers as background for Hornsby&#x27;s solos. John Molo&#x27;s drumbeats were often looped throughout the recorded versions of songs. They are typical double-time beats, which allowed Hornsby and the rest of the band to do more with their solos.
Hornsby and the Range&#x27;s second album, &quot;Scenes from the Southside&quot; (on which Peter Harris replaced Mansfield), was released in 1988. It included &quot;Look Out Any Window&quot; and &quot;The Valley Road&quot; which many critics noted for their &quot;more spacious&quot; musical arrangements, allowing for &quot;more expressive&quot; piano solos from Hornsby. It also included &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, which the Hornsby brothers wrote for musician friend Huey Lewis; Lewis&#x27;s version became a number one hit from his album &quot;Fore!&quot;. &quot;Scenes&quot; offered further slices of &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;small-town nostalgia&quot;, but it was the band&#x27;s last album to perform well in the singles market.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hornsby worked extensively as a producer and sideman, producing a comeback album &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; for Leon Russell. In 1987, Hornsby collaborated with Irish group Clannad, playing and lending vocals to their single &quot;Something to Believe In&quot;. Hornsby also appears on the official music video release for the track. In 1989, Hornsby co-wrote and played piano on Don Henley&#x27;s hit &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;. In 1991, he played piano on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot;. He also appeared on albums by Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Crosby Stills and Nash, Stevie Nicks and Squeeze.

He slowly began to introduce jazz and bluegrass elements into his music, first in live performance settings and later on studio work. In 1989, he first performed at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. He also reworked his hit &quot;The Valley Road&quot; with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for their album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two&quot;. In February 1990, the song won Best Bluegrass Recording at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards.

In May 1990, he released &quot;A Night on the Town&quot;, on which he teamed up with jazz musicians Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone) and Charlie Haden (double bass) as well as bluegrass pioneer Bela Fleck (banjo). A change in style became apparent as the album was much more rock and guitar driven, making use of Jerry Garcia&#x27;s guitar work on several tracks, including prominently on the single &quot;Across the River&quot;. In concert, Hornsby and the Range began to stretch out their songs, incorporating more and more &quot;freewheeling musical exchanges&quot;. Critics praised the album for its production, its political relevance, and Hornsby&#x27;s gestures toward expanding out of a strictly pop sound by incorporating jazz and bluegrass. Ultimately, though, the core &quot;rock band&quot; sound of the Range limited Hornsby&#x27;s aspirations, and after a final three-week tour in 1991, Hornsby disbanded the Range to enter a new phase of his career. Drummer John Molo continued to perform regularly with Hornsby for another few years, although other members pursued separate musical endeavors. Following Hornsby&#x27;s and Molo&#x27;s involvement with The Other Ones, Molo left Hornsby to become the primary drummer with bass guitarist Phil Lesh and Friends.

===Grateful Dead===

In 1988, Hornsby first appeared on stage with the Grateful Dead, a recurring collaboration that continued until the band&#x27;s dissolution. Hornsby was frequently a guest before becoming a regular fixture in the touring lineup for the Grateful Dead a few years later.

From 1988 until Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death in 1995, Hornsby played more than 100 shows with the Grateful Dead. At some shows in 1988 and 1989, he joined the band as a special guest and played accordion or synthesizer. Following the death of Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland in July 1990, Hornsby played piano (and frequently accordion) at many gigs. Mydland&#x27;s place was filled in September 1990 by Vince Welnick, who became the sole keyboardist by March 1992, although Hornsby still sat in with the band on occasion.

Hornsby&#x27;s own music evolved significantly during this time period. Critics have suggested that the Dead&#x27;s vibrant tradition of melding folk music and the blues with psychedelic rock in &quot;loose-knit expressions&quot; and extended jamming &quot;further pushed [Hornsby] outside the confines of mainstream pop&quot;. Critics have also commented upon the close musical connection formed between Hornsby and Jerry Garcia, suggesting that Hornsby&#x27;s particular style of jazz-fueled improvisation added to the band&#x27;s repertoire and helped to revitalize and refocus Garcia&#x27;s guitar solos in the band&#x27;s sound. Hornsby&#x27;s friendship with Garcia continued, both inside and outside the band, as the two &quot;challenged&quot; each other to expand their musicianship through several other album and live collaborations. Above all, Hornsby&#x27;s musical versatility and ability to slip in and out of extended freeform jams won over longtime Grateful Dead fans.

Since his first involvement with the Grateful Dead, Hornsby&#x27;s live shows have drawn Deadheads and Hornsby has commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked the group of fans that we&#x27;ve drawn from the Grateful Dead time, because those fans are often adventurous music listeners&quot;. He has performed several of their songs at his concerts and as homages on studio and live albums, while Hornsby originals &quot;The Valley Road&quot; and &quot;Stander on the Mountain&quot; appeared several times in the Dead&#x27;s setlists. Hornsby also co-performed the improvisation &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot; for the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Infrared Roses&quot;.

Hornsby was the presenter when the Grateful Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and in 2005 he participated in &quot;Comes a Time&quot;, a tribute concert to Jerry Garcia. He continues to work with Dead-related projects, such as Bob Weir&#x27;s Ratdog, Mickey Hart&#x27;s solo projects. He performed as part of The Other Ones in 1998 and 2000, and on occasion sat in with The Dead. Hornsby continues to be involved in the Grateful Dead and Furthur community. He played at the All Good Music Festival in 2012 with Bob Weir on rhythm guitar. In mid-2013, Hornsby performed with Grateful Dead-influenced bluegrass group Railroad Earth. Hornsby reunited with surviving members of the Grateful Dead along with Trey Anastasio from Phish and Jeff Chimenti at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and later at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, in July 2015.

===Solo===

Hornsby released his first solo album, &quot;Harbor Lights&quot;, in 1993. The record showcased him in a more jazz-oriented setting and featured a lineup that included Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Jerry Garcia, Phil Collins and Bonnie Raitt. Hornsby secured his third Grammy in 1993 for Best Pop Instrumental for &quot;Barcelona Mona&quot; (composed with Branford Marsalis for the Barcelona Olympics).

In 1995, &quot;Hot House&quot; was released, its cover art featuring an imagined jam session between bluegrass musician Bill Monroe and jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker. Hornsby expanded into the jazz sound from &quot;Harbor Lights&quot;, this time reintroducing elements of bluegrass from &quot;A Night on the Town&quot; and his earlier collaborations. &quot;Walk in the Sun&quot; reached number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100.

During this time period, &quot;even his concerts conveyed a looser, more playful mood, and Hornsby began taking requests from the audience&quot;. Hornsby&#x27;s concerts became &quot;departure points&quot; for his album compositions, which would be blended with and reworked into &quot;lengthy spontaneous medleys&quot;. Both in terms of audience requests and in terms of spontaneous on-stage decisions, Hornsby&#x27;s performances became opportunities for him to challenge himself by trying to &quot;find a way to seamlessly thread these seemingly disparate elements together&quot;.

Hornsby next worked with several Grateful Dead reformation projects, including several Furthur Festivals and The Other Ones, which resulted in the release of a live album, &quot;The Strange Remain&quot;. As part of The Other Ones, Hornsby performed Grateful Dead tunes &quot;Jack Straw&quot; and &quot;Sugaree&quot; (which features Hornsby on lead vocal, in Jerry Garcia&#x27;s absence), as well as Hornsby-originals &quot;White-Wheeled Limousine&quot; and &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s Cadillac&quot;. Hornsby dropped out of The Other Ones in 2002.

In 1998, three years after &quot;Hot House&quot;, Hornsby released a double album, &quot;Spirit Trail&quot;. Featuring a picture of his uncle on the cover, the collection blended instrumental tracks with the story-telling, rock, jazz, and other musical forms Hornsby had delved into over his career. The album considered &quot;very Southern&quot; themes with &quot;songs about race, religion, judgment and tolerance&quot; and &quot;struggles with these issues&quot;. An example is &quot;Sneaking Up on Boo Radley&quot;, which references the character from Harper Lee&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

Throughout the sequence of &quot;Harbor Lights&quot;, &quot;Hot House&quot;, and &quot;Spirit Trail&quot;, Hornsby&#x27;s piano playing steadily gained further complexity, taking on a more varied array of musical styles and incorporating more difficult techniques, as evidenced by his two-hand-independence on &quot;Spirit Trail&quot; &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. During this same span of solo album years, Hornsby made several mini-tours playing solo piano gigs for the first time in his career. The shows allowed Hornsby additional possibilities for segueing songs into other songs, often blurring lines between classical compositions, jazz standards, traditional bluegrass, folk, and fiddle tunes, Grateful Dead songs, as well as reworkings of Hornsby originals. Hornsby reflected on these periods of intensive solo performances, stating that the solo tours helped him &quot;recommit [himself] to the study of piano&quot; and &quot;take [his] playing to a whole new level&quot;, explorations and improvisations that would not be possible in a band setting.

In August 2014, Hornsby released his first entirely live solo album, &quot;Solo Concerts&quot;.

In April 2019, his 21st album, &quot;Absolute Zero&quot;, was released. It features collaborations with Justin Vernon and Sean Carey of Bon Iver, Jack DeJohnette, Blake Mills, yMusic, The Staves, and Brad Cook.

===The Noisemakers===
Hornsby&#x27;s touring band lineup underwent extensive changes between 1998 and 2000, with longtime drummer John Molo joining former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh in his band Phil Lesh &amp; Friends. A set of twenty consecutive shows performed by Hornsby and his band at Yoshi&#x27;s Jazz Club in Oakland, California included a lot of spontaneity and taking requests from the audience, a form that he continues at live shows to this day. As Hornsby experimented with a different sound, ushering in frequent collaborations with such musicians as Steve Kimock on guitar and Bobby Read on heavily effects-driven electronic woodwinds, a new band, dubbed the Noisemakers, took shape. In 2000, Hornsby chronicled this journey with a compilation live album entitled &quot;Here Come the Noise Makers&quot;, and did extensive touring with his new band featuring John &quot;J.T.&quot; Thomas (keyboards, organ), Bobby Read (saxophones, woodwinds, flute), J.V. Collier (bass), Doug Derryberry (guitar, mandolin), and several different drummers before Sonny Emory took over full-time.
In 2002, Hornsby released &quot;Big Swing Face&quot;. The album was Hornsby&#x27;s most experimental effort to date. It was the only album on which Hornsby barely plays any piano and relied heavily on post-electronica beats, drum loops, Pro Tools editing, and dense synthesizer arrangements. &quot;Big Swing Face&quot; received mixed reviews, ranging from &quot;a new and improved Bruce Hornsby&quot; to being called one of the &quot;strangest records of 2002&quot;.

In 2004, after 19 successful years on RCA Records, Hornsby signed with Columbia Records and returned to a more acoustic, piano-driven sound on his Columbia Records debut album, &quot;Halcyon Days&quot;, released in June 2004. Guests included Sting, Elton John and Eric Clapton.

Throughout tours following the album&#x27;s release, both with the Noisemakers and in solo performances, Hornsby continued to demonstrate his desire to &quot;grow&quot; as a singer and performer and to expand the instrumental possibilities of the piano in various genres.

In July 2006, Hornsby released a four-CD/DVD box set titled &quot;Intersections (1985–2005)&quot;. The discs are thematically broken into three categories: &quot;Top 90 Time&quot;, &quot;Solo Piano, Tribute Records, Country-Bluegrass, Movie Scores&quot;, and &quot;By Request (Favorites and Best Songs)&quot;. A full third of the music is previously unreleased; many familiar tracks are presented as unreleased live versions rather than the original studio recordings, and the majority of the remaining tracks are from single B-sides, collaborations or tribute albums, and movie soundtracks. One song, &quot;Song H&quot;, a new composition, was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental in 2007 at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.

In 2007, Hornsby began more regularly playing classical music: at a concert in St. Louis, Missouri, during Hornsby&#x27;s improvisational session in &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, he began playing J.S. Bach&#x27;s Goldberg Variations along with the drums. In a different city, he played five straight Goldberg Variations over the drum intro of &quot;Gonna Be Some Changes Made&quot;.

On September 15, 2009, Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers released their fourth album, &quot;Levitate&quot; to mixed reviews; it included new solo material with several songs co-written with Chip DiMatteo for the Broadway play &quot;SCKBSTD&quot;.

In May 2011, the band released a live album, &quot;Bride of the Noisemakers&quot;.

On June 17, 2016, Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers released their sixth album and fourth studio album, &quot;Rehab Reunion&quot;. Hornsby only plays the dulcimer on the album and does not play piano. The album was also Hornsby&#x27;s first release on 429 Records. Like on many of his previous releases, &quot;Rehab Reunion&quot; features collaborations with guest artists. Justin Vernon of Bon Iver sings background vocals on &quot;Over the Rise&quot;. Mavis Staples duets with Hornsby on &quot;Celestial Railroad&quot;. Also noteworthy is a folk version of &quot;The Valley Road&quot;, originally a hit in 1988 with Hornsby&#x27;s first backing band, the Range.

===Skaggs &amp; Hornsby/The Bruce Hornsby Trio===
In March 2007, Hornsby teamed with bluegrass player Ricky Skaggs to produce a bluegrass album, &quot;Ricky Skaggs &amp; Bruce Hornsby&quot;, followed by a tour. In 2000, the pair had collaborated on &quot;Darlin&#x27; Cory&quot;, a track on the &quot;Big Mon&quot; Bill Monroe bluegrass music. &quot;Ricky Skaggs &amp; Bruce Hornsby&quot;, featuring the duo backed by Skaggs&#x27;s band Kentucky Thunder, combined bluegrass, traditional country music, jazzy piano and a splash of humor on a spectrum of songs from the traditional to new compositions such as the opening track, &quot;The Dreaded Spoon&quot;, a humorous tale of a youthful ice cream heist. The pair also reinvented Hornsby&#x27;s hit &quot;Mandolin Rain&quot; as a minor key acoustic ballad and give his cautionary tale of backwoods violence, &quot;A Night on the Town&quot;, a treatment highlighting the &quot;Appalachian storytelling tradition that was always at the song&#x27;s heart&quot;.

The album ended with a cover of Rick James&#x27;s funk hit &quot;Super Freak&quot; in a bluegrass arrangement. The album peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bluegrass Albums list; it was on the charts for 52 weeks. With the album, Hornsby disproved the notion that the piano is not compatible with &quot;string-oriented&quot; bluegrass. The duo released the live album &quot;Cluck Ol&#x27; Hen&quot; in September 2013.

Concurrently with the bluegrass project, Hornsby recorded a jazz album, &quot;Camp Meeting&quot; with Christian McBride (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums). Alongside original compositions by Hornsby, the trio delivered newly reharmonized versions of tunes by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, a previously unrecorded Ornette Coleman work (&quot;Questions and Answers&quot;) and an early Keith Jarrett composition (&quot;Death and the Flower&quot;). The trio made a series of appearances in the summer of 2007, including the Playboy Jazz Festival, the Newport Jazz Festival and at the Hollywood Bowl.

On January 4, 2007, former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart reunited along with Hornsby, Mike Gordon (of Phish and the Rhythm Devils) and Warren Haynes to play two sets, including Dead classics, at a post-inauguration fundraising party for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

Hornsby wrote songs for &quot;SCKBSTD&quot;, a Broadway Musical; one song from this project, a playful biographical tune about real-estate tycoon Donald Trump titled &quot;The Don of Dons&quot;, was played often at Hornsby&#x27;s solo piano performances in early 2007. In 2009, he composed the score for Spike Lee&#x27;s ESPN documentary, &quot;Kobe Doin&#x27; Work&quot;, about NBA star Kobe Bryant and his MVP season.

Hornsby invested in Williamsburg area radio station &quot;The Tide&quot; WTYD 92.3 FM. He has endowed the Bruce Hornsby Creative American Music Program at the Frost School of Music of University of Miami. Hornsby played himself in a cameo role in the Robin Williams movie &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot;, in which Williams&#x27; character is a Bruce Hornsby fan.

==Additional collaborations==
On July 10, 1990, Hornsby made a guest appearance with the Grateful Dead onstage at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, NC, playing accordion during portions of the first and second sets. Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland died just over two weeks later, and Hornsby was summoned as a temporary replacement. The Grateful Dead released this concert on YouTube in its entirety on July 10, 2020, the 30th anniversary of the performance.

On October 18, 1991, Hornsby joined Pink Floyd, co-founder Roger Waters on stage at Auditorio de la Cartuja in Seville, Spain. Playing keyboards and singing the choruses of Comfortably Numb.

In 2014, Hornsby toured selected dates with Pat Metheny Unity Group.

In 2016, Hornsby performed on a track, &quot;Black Muddy River&quot;, along with indie folk band (and Justin Vernon&#x27;s former band) DeYarmond Edison on &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, a Grateful Dead cover album, benefiting the Red Hot Organization, an international charity dedicated to raising funds and awareness for HIV and AIDS. Hornsby performed the song alongside Vernon that same year in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Hornsby performed alongside Vernon at Coachella in 2017, performing Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me;&quot; the performance also featured Jenny Lewis.

Hornsby has composed and performed for many projects with filmmaker Spike Lee, including end-title songs for two films, &quot;Clockers&quot; (1995) with Chaka Khan and &quot;Bamboozled&quot; (2001). He contributed music for &quot;If God Is Willing and da Creek Don&#x27;t Rise&quot; (2010), &quot;Old Boy&quot; (2013) and &quot;Chi-Raq&quot; (2015), and full film scores for Lee&#x27;s Kobe Bryant documentary for ESPN: &quot;Kobe Doin&#x27; Work&quot; (2009), &quot;Red Hook Summer&quot; (2012), &quot;Da Sweet Blood of Jesus&quot; (2015), and Lee&#x27;s film for the NBA 2K16 video game (2015). He scored Lee&#x27;s Netflix production &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; (2017, 2019). Hornsby wrote and performed new music for Lee&#x27;s film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; (2018). in 1993, Lee directed the video for Hornsby&#x27;s song &quot;Talk Of The Town&quot;.

On July 3, 2023, Bruce appeared with The Doobie Brothers in Portsmouth, Virginia during their extended 50th anniversary tour, where he performed on keyboards and soloed on several songs.

On December 9, 2023, Bruce appeared with Goose in Hampton, Virginia during their Goosemas run, where he performed &quot;The Way It Is&quot; on keyboards.

==Equipment==
Hornsby uses a Steinway &amp; Sons concert grand piano. With the Range and up until 1995, he used a Baldwin concert grand piano. He currently uses a Korg M1 synthesizer. With the Range, Hornsby used an Oberheim OB-X synthesizer.

Hornsby selected ten Model B Steinway Grands to be featured in its Limited Edition Signature Piano Series, each one personalized with his signature. Hornsby owns three Model D Steinway Grands.

For his 2016 album &quot;Rehab Reunion&quot;, he played Appalachian dulcimer made by BlueLion.

==Personal life==
Hornsby and his wife Kathy have twin sons, born 1992: Russell, who ran for the Oregon Ducks track and field team at the University of Oregon, and Keith, who played Division I basketball for the University of North Carolina Asheville Bulldogs from 2011 to 2013, transferred to Louisiana State University and played for LSU from 2014 to 2016. They were named after musicians Leon Russell and Keith Jarrett, respectively.

Hornsby is a regular basketball player and an avid fan of the sport. As such, he can frequently be seen at college basketball games throughout Virginia. Hornsby stated that he beat Allen Iverson in one-on-one basketball three games in a row after helping him get out of jail. He is also a friend of baseball Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa and attends games in St. Louis. Their friendship led to La Russa introducing Hornsby to jazz bassist Christian McBride, which then led to the formation of The Bruce Hornsby Trio (along with drummer Jack DeJohnette) and their first album, &quot;Camp Meeting&quot;.

<text>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood, affecting approximately 3.8 to 400 out of 100,000 children. &quot;Juvenile&quot;, in this context, refers to disease onset before 16 years of age, while &quot;idiopathic&quot; refers to a condition with no defined cause, and &quot;arthritis&quot; is inflammation within the joint.

JIA is an autoimmune, noninfective, inflammatory joint disease, the cause of which remains poorly understood. It is characterised by chronic joint inflammation. JIA is a subset of childhood arthritis, but unlike other, more transient forms of childhood arthritis, JIA persists for at least six weeks, and in some children is a lifelong condition. It differs significantly from forms of arthritis commonly seen in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), in terms of cause, disease associations, and prognosis.

The prognosis for children with JIA has improved dramatically over recent decades, particularly with the introduction of biological therapies and a shift towards more aggressive treatment strategies. JIA treatment aims for normal physical and psychosocial functioning, which is an achievable goal for some children with this condition.

==Signs and symptoms==
Arthritis means inflammation within the joint, and is usually recognised by swelling, pain, stiffness and restricted joint movement. Symptoms of JIA vary from individual to individual. This is mainly because JIA is an umbrella term for several subtypes of JIA, which differ according to the number of affected joints, severity of disease and presence or absence of inflammation in other parts of the body.

The key clinical feature in JIA is persistent swelling of the affected joints. Any joint can be affected, but large joints such as the knee and ankle are most commonly involved. Involvement of small joints of the hands and feet is more likely when many joints are affected (&#x27;polyarthritis&#x27;). Swollen joints may also feel warmer to touch. Swelling may be difficult to detect clinically, especially for joints such as those of the spine, sacroiliac joints, shoulder, hip, and jaw; imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI can be very useful to identify the inflammation.

Joint pain is an important symptom, although some children experience minimal or no pain with their arthritis. In these children, the first sign of arthritis may be limping, especially in the morning. Young children are often very good at changing how they move when they have joint pain: they learn to move so that it does not hurt. For example, a child will not push up using an inflamed wrist when climbing, instead putting their weight through the forearm. Morning stiffness that improves later in the day is a common feature (this implies inflammatory-type joint pain versus mechanical-type joint pain).

Swelling and pain usually result in limited movement of the affected joints, for example a knee held bent causing a limp, or being unable to make a full fist. Limited movement may reduce a child&#x27;s ability to fully participate in activities and undertake usual tasks such as those used for self-care. In some JIA subtypes, more non-specific symptoms of being unwell may be present, such as lethargy, fatigue and poor appetite. Children with systemic JIA usually present with fever and a classic rash and may become quite ill. Late effects of arthritis can include joint contractures (stiff, bent joints with loss of movement) due to joint damage; limb length discrepancies and muscle wasting. Children with JIA vary in the degree to which they are affected by particular symptoms.

===Extra-articular===
Eye disease: JIA is associated with inflammation in the front of the eye (specifically iridocyclitis, a form of chronic anterior uveitis), which affects about one in six children with JIA. Eye involvement occurs most commonly in girls, those with only a few joints involved (oligoarthritis), and those with a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). It usually follows the onset of arthritis or may be detected at the same time as arthritis; occasionally it may occur before joint involvement. The factors linking eye and joint disease are not clearly understood, and the two do not necessarily follow the same course. This complication is usually asymptomatic (without symptoms) and can occur when the joints are not active. It can be detected by an experienced optometrist or ophthalmologist using a slit lamp to look for inflammatory cells in the fluid inside the eye. Most children with JIA will require referral for regular slit lamp screening examinations. Poorly controlled chronic anterior uveitis may result in permanent eye damage, including blindness.

Systemic JIA: children with the Systemic JIA subtype often experience extra-articular manifestations including fever, rash, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen, serositis and anaemia.

===Complications===
JIA is a chronic disorder, which if neglected, can lead to serious complications. However, with regular follow-up and modern treatments, complications have reduced and outcomes improved. If inflammation is not treated, it can damage the joint, the cartilage and the bone. With the advent of modern therapies, these complications of JIA have become much less common.

Children with JIA may have a reduced overall rate of growth, especially if the disease involves many joints or other body systems. This may be due to a combination of the disease itself, as well as its treatments, particularly corticosteroid use. Paradoxically, limbs where a large joint (such as the knee) is inflamed may have increased growth in the short term, leading to limb-length discrepancy (i.e. one arm or leg is slightly longer than the other). This is due to increased blood supply to the bony growth plates surrounding the inflamed joints. Bone density and bone strength may be reduced through a combination of inflammation, corticosteroid use and reduced physical activity levels. Other musculoskeletal complications may include joint contractures, muscle weakness or muscle wasting.

Uveitis, if left untreated, can result in scarring, glaucoma, cataracts, and even blindness. Regular monitoring allows for early detection and treatment. Steroid eye drops are usually the first line treatment for anterior uveitis. However, other treatments – many of which also treat arthritis (e.g. methotrexate, biologics) – may be required to keep the inflammation under control, and to minimise steroid use over the longer term. Long term steroid use can cause contribute to the development of cataracts.

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe, potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients with the systemic subtype of JIA. MAS involves uncontrolled activation of the immune system, sometimes referred to as a &#x27;cytokine storm&#x27;, which can present with a sepsis-like picture of fever, rash, enlarged liver and spleen, enlarged lymph nodes and cardiorespiratory compromise. It is recognised by a series of characteristic changes in laboratory parameters, including a high ferritin and a paradoxically low erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

==Causes==
The cause of JIA remains unknown. However, the disorder is autoimmune — meaning that the body&#x27;s own immune system starts to attack and destroy cells and tissues (particularly in the joints) for no apparent reason. The immune system is thought to be provoked by changes in the environment, in combination with mutations in many associated genes and/or other causes of differential expression of genes. Experimental studies have shown that certain mutated viruses may be able to trigger JIA. The disease appears to be more common in girls, and is most common in Caucasians.

The cause of JIA, as the word &quot;idiopathic&quot; suggests, is unknown and an area of active research. Current understanding of JIA suggests that it arises in a genetically susceptible individual due to environmental factors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of JIA can be difficult, in part because joint pain in children is so common and may be from many causes other than JIA. The characteristic feature of arthritis is joint swelling which is sometimes – but not always – associated with pain. The presence of joint stiffness is another typical feature, particularly when present in the morning and improving with activity.

No single test can confirm a diagnosis of JIA: a combination of presenting signs and symptoms, blood tests, and if necessary medical imaging, is used to make the diagnosis. The blood tests may measure levels of inflammatory markers, as well as the presence of specific immune markers which may include anti-nuclear antibody, HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor and anti–citrullinated protein antibody. These serological markers may be negative in children with JIA, and are often present in healthy children; as such they should not be interpreted in isolation but in the context of the clinical presentation. Many children with JIA have normal blood work. X-rays may be required to ensure that the joint pain and swelling is not from a fracture, cancer, infection, or congenital abnormality. In some cases, fluid from the joint can be aspirated and analysed to assist in making a diagnosis. This test can assist by ruling out other causes of arthritis such as infection.

===Classification===

The current classification system by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) recognizes seven distinct subtypes of JIA, based on their presentation within the first six months:
 Each subtype has a specific pattern of features as outlined in the table and descriptions below. (The seventh category, not included in the table, is &#x27;Undifferentiated&#x27; and includes any patient with JIA who does not meet criteria for other subtypes, or who meets criteria for two or more subtypes).

====Oligoarticular arthritis====
 (or ) JIA is the most common JIA subtype, and occurs when there are up to four joints involved during the first six months of disease. Two subtypes of oligoarticular arthritis exist: persistent oligoarthritis, where no more than four joints are affected throughout the whole disease course; and extended oligoarthritis, where more than four joints are affected after the first six months of disease. Patients in this subtype are often young, typically aged two to three years and with a female preponderance. The most commonly involved joint is the knee, but other affected joints may include the ankles, wrists, elbows and others. The anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) is positive in up to 80% of patients with oligoarthritis and is associated with a higher risk of associated eye disease (uveitis), particularly in younger patients. The prefixes and mean &#x27;few&#x27;.

===Differential diagnosis===
There are several other disorders and diseases that present with symptoms like JIA. These causes include, but are not limited to, infectious (for example septic arthritis or osteomyelitis) and post-infectious conditions (reactive arthritis, acute rheumatic fever, and in some geographic areas Lyme disease); hematologic and neoplastic diseases such as leukemia or bony tumors; and other connective tissue diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). For the systemic-onset form of JIA, the differential diagnosis also includes Kawasaki disease and periodic fever syndromes. Some genetic skeletal dysplasias as forms of mucopolysaccharidosis especially type1 Scheie syndrome, progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia and multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy syndrome may also mimic JIA, as they may present with joint swelling, joint restriction, stiffness, and pain. The clinical and radiologic overlap between genetic skeletal dysplasias and JIA can be great that molecular analysis may be need to confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, metabolic diseases, such as Farber disease may also mimic JIA. Patients with Farber disease typically have subcutaneous nodules and a hoarse or weak voice due to growth of nodules on the larynx.

==Treatment==
The major emphasis of the treatment of JIA is helping the child or young person regain normal levels of physical and social functioning by controlling inflammation and extra-articular symptoms. Clinical remission should be the primary target for all patients and treatment should be adjusted until this is achieved. Prompt recognition and management is important as early initiation of therapy increases the likelihood of a response to first-line treatments and of achieving drug-free remission later in life. While overarching consensus treatment guidelines exist, all treatments should be specifically tailored to the individual&#x27;s needs in discussion with the child or young person and their family.

Optimal management of JIA requires a multidisciplinary team working to address the needs of an individual patient. Optimising physical and social functioning is accomplished via a two-pronged approach: non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapies, pain management strategies, and social supports; and the swift use of medication to control inflammation and extra-articular symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative in helping reduce joint damage and other symptoms, which will help reduce levels of permanent damage leading to long term disability.

===Non-pharmacological treatments===
The optimal approach to treating a child with JIA typically involves a team of medical professionals, which may include (but is not limited to) paediatric rheumatologists, paediatric rheumatology nurses, general paediatricians, general practitioners, adult rheumatologists, physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), podiatrists, psychologists, social workers, pharmacists, ophthalmologists and orthopaedic surgeons. The multi-disciplinary team (MDT) work in conjunction with the child and their parents, the local health service and medical team, the child&#x27;s school and teachers, community leaders and sports coaches to best support the child and their family.

Together, the team help children to participate as fully and independently as possible in their daily activities by maximising quality of life, maximising function and minimising disruption to the life of the child or young person.

The multidisciplinary team work together to provide the child and their family with support and education about JIA, strategies to promote age-appropriate self-sufficiency and help the child to adapt and adjust to any challenges they face. There are many ways to make daily tasks easier or more manageable. One of the key ways the multidisciplinary team helps children with JIA is to involve them, and their families, in the decision-making process regarding their treatment and rehabilitation.

In young children with JIA, symptoms may result in either delay or regression in developmental milestones such as walking, running or climbing. Upper limb function may also be affected. Members of the multidisciplinary team can perform developmental assessments to identify deficits and guide treatments. The information gathered can be shared with schools and child care facilities.

One of the key ways occupational or physical therapists help young children with JIA is by developing a home therapy program based around play. Exercises are prescribed by both physical therapists and occupational therapists to increase the range a child can move a joint, to strengthen the muscles around a joint, to decrease pain and stiffness and to prevent further limitations in their joint movements. OTs and PTs can provide children with age-appropriate games and activities to allow the children to practice their exercises while playing and socializing with friends. Examples are crafts, swimming, and sports.

Children with JIA may experience challenges with low mood, social interaction, reduced self-confidence and negative self-image. Psychologists, OTs, nurses, social workers and other team members can work with the child and their family to develop strategies to help with these issues. Many JIA support organisations run camps and activities for children with JIA and their families.

Surgery is only used to treat the most severe cases of JIA and is now rarely required.

====Physical therapy and exercise====
Maintaining physical activity is important in all children, but especially for children with JIA. The physical therapist has a role in guiding physical rehabilitation (muscle stretching and strengthening, enhancing joint range of movement, improving balance, etc.); optimising physical functioning; goal-setting; and improving a child&#x27;s confidence in their own body. They usually work with the child and family to develop a home exercise program which changes over time as the child makes progress.

Arthritis in childhood can be associated with muscle weakness and wasting around the affected joints. It can also lead to low bone density, which may predispose to osteoporosis and fractures in adulthood. Getting regular exercise is an important part of the management of JIA to promote bone and muscle health.

There is variation in the exact exercise prescription which best promotes musculoskeletal health whilst reducing fatigue, pain and swelling. Consensus is that children with JIA should be following national public health standards of physical activity and participating in moderate fitness, flexibility, and strengthening exercises, compatible with their abilities and disease restrictions. Current PA guidelines for children recommend at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity daily, including vigorous activity on at least three days per week. Although research highlights the benefits of various forms of PA for improving health outcomes in children JIA, many parents and children remain hesitant that exercise may worsen symptoms. This fear, combined with the lack of clear exercise guidance in clinical settings, creates uncertainty and hesitation about appropriate PA recommendations. Encouraging healthy habits early in life and addressing fear-avoidance behaviors in children with JIA can enhance both musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health. 

It is important that – across the week – the exercise is a combination of moderate to vigorous cardiovascular activity (e.g. walking to school, scooting, bike-riding, playing tag, dancing, doing physical education, sports such as basketball or football) and strengthening exercises. Bone strengthening activities build up muscles; by having the muscles push and pull against the bone, the bones themselves get stronger. This can include things like playing on climbing equipment, swinging on monkey-bars, using weights, carrying groceries, skipping or running.

A Cochrane meta-analysis looking at existing RCTs showed in all studies that exercise does not have a detrimental effect on JIA. In fact, there is evidence to show that both low and high-intensity exercise programs result in improved physical function and reduced pain in children with JIA. Guidelines indicate that children with JIA should be encouraged to be physically active and can safely participate in sports without disease exacerbation. Those with actively inflamed joints should limit activities within pain limits, then gradually return to full activity following a disease flare. Studies found that a 12-week exercise program of weight-bearing exercise plus standardized muscle strengthening exercises for children with JIA led to significant improvements in bone mineral density, bringing measurements for children with JIA within the reference range of healthy children. 

It may be necessary to use aids like splints or casts to correct biomechanics, but prolonged splinting and casting are now rarely indicated for children with JIA. Following joint injections, children are often advised to &#x27;take it easy&#x27;, often undertaking one to two days of low activity, although advice around this varies. When a joint (usually a knee) loses range of motion due to prolonged inflammation and pain, a series of plaster casts may be used to gradually extend shortened muscles and restore range. These serial casts are usually applied over days to weeks. Active strengthening and lengthening is used in conjunction with serial casting for optimal results.

Some children may benefit from foot orthotics to support and correct body position and function. Orthotics maintain biomechanical alignment and may reduce discomfort in the legs and back when children participate in physical activities such as sports.

====Self-management====
Pain is the most common and often the most distressing symptom of JIA (although some children with JIA do have joint inflammation without any pain at all). Pain can occur even when children are receiving effective doses of therapies which are managing their underlying disease. A multinational study showed that pain is a predictor of psycho-social well-being. Several studies has also shown that pain at debut is a strong predictor of persistent pain. 

Pain has been found to negatively impact all aspects of quality of life and is associated with a reduction in physical, social and emotional functioning. Children who have higher levels of pain tend to have reduced levels of socialization, school attendance and participation in activities. Increased pain is also correlated with poor sleep and higher fatigue in children with JIA.

The causation of pain in JIA is multifactorial. There are disease-related factors, which relate to the inflammatory process, and anatomical or biomechanical changes that are associated with joint swelling and joint disease. There are psychological factors around dealing with stress, coping with a chronic illness and managing anxiety or depression which can influence the perception of pain and the degree of functional impairment. There are also social factors, which relate to family and peer relationships, parental distress and social and financial supports.

Given the waxing and waning nature of JIA, children&#x27;s physical abilities, pain and mood can change during periods of flare or remission. Coping with chronic illness during childhood and adolescence is associated with significant stress that can put children at risk for emotional or behavioural distress and can interfere with compliance and adherence to treatment regimes. Managing JIA can be a challenge and it is important to have a toolbox of skills, supports and strategies to draw upon to manage the ups and downs of having a chronic illness.

There are many things that can help children with JIA to grow up to have full and active lives. Having good sleep habits and routines gives a child the best chance of having a refreshing night&#x27;s sleep and preventing daytime fatigue. This in turn affects concentration, energy levels, memory and mood. Most children need between eight and twelve hours of sleep to feel refreshed, depending on age. Simple strategies like maintaining regular bedtimes, limiting screen time to two hours before bed, having a sleep ritual, avoiding napping during the day, avoiding sugary and caffeinated drinks, having a healthy well-balanced diet, regular exercise and using relaxation techniques can assist in having good night&#x27;s sleep.

Relaxation techniques can also help to reduce stress, physical tension and be a useful pain management technique. There are a variety of mindfulness strategies which include things like deep breathing, guided-imagery or progressive muscle relaxation. All techniques need to be practiced over time, and it may be necessary to try different combinations to find the method that works best for each individual. These techniques are readily available online, in books, recordings, apps or by seeing a trained professional such as a psychologist.

====Education and employment====
Most children with JIA will be able to consistently attend school, without too many disruptions, even during a disease flare. However, they may require extra help or adaptations in order to do so. Maximising school attendance involves collaboration between the family, the school and the health care team. Prolonged or repeated school absences can have academic, social and emotional implications; except in rare circumstances they are rarely necessary (other than absences for medical or therapy appointments).

These adaptations may include requiring extra time to get between classes or during examinations, using specialised pens or switching to typing rather than handwriting, or minimising the load of heavy books or equipment to be carried in a child&#x27;s school bag. The exact requirements will vary from child-to-child and will depend on the joints affected. In many instances, the child&#x27;s treating team will be able to provide specific advice and information for teachers and coaches to smooth the transition back to school. This may take the form of an individualized plan outlining any extra measures that need to be taken at school, what to do in the case of unexpected events or medication administration during school hours. Importantly, JIA can be disruptive not just to the academic aspects of school. It is equally important to optimise school attendance so that the child can maintain friendships and keep up with opportunities to socialize with peers.

As adolescents progress through high school, they may need to factor their current medical status and functional abilities into decisions around their future education and employment plans. Most children with JIA will not be restricted in their study goals or professional aspirations. Students with JIA can usually apply for special arrangements during assessment periods, such as additional time to allow for rest/stretch periods and use of adaptive equipment in some situations. These applications often need to be supported by the treating medical team. The treating team can assist adolescents in finding ways to tell their employers about their condition in a positive way. OTs and social workers can also help teenagers understand their rights as an employee with a chronic illness. It is important that adolescents with JIA understand how to take care of themselves and manage their disease when working full-time or attending higher education. The team will also support those patients who still require medical input through the transition process from paediatric to adult services.

===eHealth and mobile Health (mHealth) interventions ===
A new emerging area of support for disease management is through digital technology using eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) interventions. These interventions have to potential to support the development of self-management skills, or assist the healthcare team to monitor symptoms. For JIA, current studies have focused on the health issues pain, health related quality of life, physical activity and disease management. Children and adolescents have used these interventions through a range of devices including computers, laptops, personal digital assistants, multimedia-players, and wearable accelerometers synchronised to smart phone. This allows access to these interventions from home. Early usability studies have been gaining positive feedback by children and adolescents. They are familiar with this type of technology and report liking these interventions. However further research is still needed to understand their full potential in supporting children and adolescents living with complex needs.

==Prognosis==
At the time of receiving a JIA diagnosis, children and their families often have many questions regarding prognosis. Recent therapeutic advances in the management of JIA have made inactive disease and clinical remission achievable goals for the majority of children with access to modern treatments. Clinical remission can be defined as the absence of signs and symptoms of inflammatory disease activity, including extra-articular manifestations of the disease. Differentiating subtypes of JIA helps to target treatment and leads to more positive outcomes, however subtype is not the only predictor of JIA outcome. Poor prognostic factors include arthritis of the hip, cervical spine, ankles or wrists; prolonged elevation of inflammatory markers; and radiographic evidence of joint damage including erosions or joint space narrowing. Patients with RF-positive polyarthritis often have worse outcomes associated with more aggressive disease. Despite this, the probability of this subgroup achieving inactive disease at least once within five years was shown to be 90% in a large Canadian study. Research is currently being undertaken into clinical prediction models to allow earlier identification of children who are likely to have a worse prognosis. Compliance with therapy, especially medication, has a positive correlation with disease outcome.

Research into specific JIA biomarkers is currently underway, with the goal of forming more personalized treatment plans, reducing medication side effects and improving remission rates. Current areas of investigation include clinical, protein, genetic and radiological markers, amongst others.

Children with JIA demonstrate similar levels of depression and anxiety to children with other chronic diseases; however, causality has not been established. The unpredictable and undulating course of JIA disease activity and the need for ongoing procedural interventions may contribute.

It has been previously suggested that children with JIA are at an increased risk of malignancies when being treated with anti-TNF therapy. More recent data has not confirmed this association: it is thought that the disease itself is linked with a slightly higher background risk of malignancy. Ongoing data analysis on large patient populations continues in this area.

==Epidemiology==
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is the most common, chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. In high-income countries, yearly incidence has been estimated at 2–20 cases per 100,000 population; prevalence in these areas is estimated at 16–150 cases per 100,000 population. However, there is also a suggestion that these numbers underestimate disease prevalence: one community-based survey of school children in Western Australia reported a prevalence of 400 per 100,000. Overall prevalence is often summarised as one per thousand children.

Incidence and prevalence data vary across different population and ethnic groups, with lower overall prevalence in Afro-Caribbean and Asian populations. There are also ethnic differences in the frequency of JIA subtypes: for example, oligoarthritis is the most common subtype in European populations, whilst polyarticular disease predominates in many other countries including Costa Rica, India, New Zealand, and South Africa.

There are differences in age of onset, gender and disease outcomes based on JIA subtype: these are outlined in the table above.

==Terminology==
The terminology used to describe JIA is evolving, and each term has some limitations.

Previous terminology included Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and Juvenile Chronic Arthritis. These terms were replaced in 1997 with the release of the revised ILAR (International League of Associations for Rheumatology) classification criteria.

There is currently an international movement underway to further revise the classification criteria for JIA, although this is in a preliminary phase.

MeSH uses &quot;juvenile arthritis&quot; as the primary entry, and uses &quot;idiopathic&quot;, &quot;chronic&quot; and &quot;rheumatoid&quot; in alternate entries.

<doc id="619079" wikidata="Q2082706" url="?curid=619079" title="The Aristocrats">
<text>&quot;The Aristocrats&quot; is a taboo-defying, off-color joke that has been told by numerous stand-up comedians since the vaudeville era. It relates the story of a family trying to get an agent to book their stage act, which is remarkably vulgar and offensive. The punch line reveals that they incongruously bill themselves as &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;. When told to audiences who know the punch line, the joke&#x27;s humor depends on the described outrageousness of the family act. Because the objective of the joke is its transgressive content, it is most often told privately, such as by comedians to other comedians.

The joke came to wider public attention when Gilbert Gottfried told it during the Friars&#x27; Club roast of Hugh Hefner to recover after losing the crowd and eliciting &quot;booing and hissing&quot; with a joke about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which had occurred just 18 days prior. The 2005 documentary film of the same name by Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette featured numerous comedians discussing and retelling the joke. Jillette has claimed the routine was Johnny Carson&#x27;s favorite joke of all time.

==Format==

This joke typically has these elements—alternative versions may change this form.
# Setup: A family act (or a representative, usually a head of household) goes in to see a talent agent about booking their act. The agent asks what their act consists of.
#Act: If the whole family is present, the act is performed for the agent; otherwise it is described, in as much detail as the teller prefers, typically ad lib. Traditionally, the description is tasteless and ribald, with the goal to significantly transgress social norms. Taboo elements such as racism, animal cruelty, incest, rape, child sexual abuse, coprophilia, coprophagia, bestiality, necrophilia, cannibalism, and murder are common themes.
#Punch line: The shocked (or intrigued) agent asks what the act is called, and the proud answer (sometimes delivered with a flourish) is: &quot;The Aristocrats!&quot;

<doc id="619080" wikidata="Q3414860" url="?curid=619080" title="Le Québécois Libre">
<text>Le Québécois Libre (or QL) was an online libertarian magazine, or webzine published in Quebec, Canada. The &quot;QL&quot;, owned and published by Martin Masse since February 1998, portrayed a classical liberal point of view on numerous topics, particularly related to current affairs in Quebec, or, to a lesser extent, France and the United States.

The principal language of the magazine was French, but a quarter of the articles were written in English. &quot;Le Québécois Libre&quot; accommodated all liberal views including minarchism and anarcho-capitalism. Articles have been featured on National Post and C2C journals.

The name &quot;Le Québécois Libre&quot; is a pun on &quot;Québec Libre&quot;, a nationalist slogan, as the magazine aimed to promote the freedom of those living in Quebec rather than the nationalist aim of promoting the state. It featured articles by Martin Masse, Ron Paul, Scott Reid and Pascal Salin, among others. In 2016 the magazine ceased publication.

<doc id="619095" wikidata="Q362844" url="?curid=619095" title="First Comics">
<text>First Comics is an American comic book publisher that was active from 1983 to 1991 and then from 2011 to present (stylized as 1First Comics), known for titles like &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, &quot;Grimjack&quot;, &quot;Nexus&quot;, &quot;Badger&quot;, &quot;Dreadstar&quot;, and &quot;Jon Sable&quot;. Along with competitors like Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, First took early advantage of the growing direct market, attracting a number of writers and artists from DC and Marvel to produce creator-owned titles, which, as they were not subject to the Comics Code, were free to feature more mature content.

==History==
Based in Evanston, Illinois, First Comics was co-founded by Ken F. Levin and Mike Gold. It launched in 1983 with a line-up of creators including Frank Brunner, Mike Grell, Howard Chaykin, Joe Staton, Steven Grant, Timothy Truman, and Jim Starlin. In 1984, First acquired all the titles of the short-lived publisher Capital Comics, including Mike Baron&#x27;s action/superhero/fantasy/comedy series &quot;Badger&quot;, and Baron and Steve Rude&#x27;s space-superhero series &quot;Nexus&quot;.

Among First&#x27;s best-known titles were Chaykin&#x27;s satirical futuristic cop series &quot;American Flagg&quot;; John Ostrander and Tim Truman&#x27;s &quot;Grimjack&quot;; Baron &amp; Rude&#x27;s &quot;Nexus&quot;; &quot;Badger&quot;; Jim Starlin&#x27;s space opera series &quot;Dreadstar&quot; and Mike Grell&#x27;s &quot;Jon Sable&quot;, which was briefly adapted for TV.

In 1984, the publisher sued industry giant Marvel Comics, claiming that Marvel flooded the market with new titles in 1983 in order to shut out First and other new companies. In the same lawsuit, First also sued printer World Color Press for anti-competitive activities, claiming the printer undercharged Marvel for its business, and in return overcharged First and its fellow independents. The suit was resolved in the spring of 1988.

The company moved to Chicago in 1985. Mike Gold, one of First&#x27;s founders, served as the company president until late 1985; Gold soon moved to New York to become a senior editor at DC Comics. Gold later used his First Comics connections to bring Grell, Chaykin, and Truman over to DC, where they created series such as &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, and &quot;Hawkworld&quot;.

From 1985 to 1988, First published Peter B. Gillis and Mike Saenz&#x27;s digital comic &quot;Shatter&quot;, the first commercially published all-digital comic book.

In 1986, despite its success with the direct market, First experimented with newsstand distribution. Later that same year, the publisher found itself in the middle of the industry-wide debate about creators&#x27; rights. Clashes with DC Comics, First, and other publishers on this issue led in part to the drafting of the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights signed by Scott McCloud, Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird, Dave Sim, Rick Veitch, and other comics creators in late 1988.

First also published a series of comic adaptations of the &quot;Eternal Champion&quot; books by Michael Moorcock and English translations of the Japanese manga series &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;.

The company&#x27;s final major project was a revival of &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;. The company partnered with Berkley Books (then Berkley Publishing Group) to acquire the rights, and &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; returned with new adaptations and a line-up of artists that included Kyle Baker, Dean Motter, Mike Ploog, P. Craig Russell, Bill Sienkiewicz, Joe Staton, Rick Geary, and Gahan Wilson. However, the line lasted only a little over a year.

First Comics ceased publishing in 1991, and closed their doors for good in early 1992.

=== Rebirth ===
At San Diego Comic-Con in 2011, First co-founder Levin announced that the company would resume publishing new material in late 2011. Two years later, Mike Baron announced a new project on his Facebook page: &quot;HOWL! coming next year from First Comics. Shane Oakley is the artist&quot;. Publishing resumed in June 2014.

First Comics and Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing merged to form Devil&#x27;s Due/1First Comics LLC in June 2015. In addition to reprinting older properties, Devil&#x27;s Due/1First Comics launched five new ongoing series. Despite the merge and emphasis on creator owned properties, both 1First Comics and Devil&#x27;s Due intend to maintain editorial independence.

First Comics and Devil&#x27;s Due parted ways and by September of 2019, First Comics was publishing titles under their own banner. 

Since 2019, First Comics has continued publishing creator-owned titles, including Inspector Oh and Love Town by Matt and John Yuan, Night Stalker by Orlando Harding, and the Dogwitch Omnibus by Dan Schaeffer.

In December of 2020, First Comics launched its board game division, First Games (aka 1First Games) with a board game adaptation of the Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson series The Boys. 

In February of 2022, Matt and John Yuan were named Deputy Publishers.

== Awards ==
The company picked up many industry awards, including a 1985 Kirby Award for Best Graphic Album for &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

== Legacy/collected editions ==
Dark Horse Comics would later reprint the &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; series in English, and finally complete it in 2002. In 2005, IDW Publishing revived &quot;Jon Sable&quot; and &quot;Grimjack&quot; with new miniseries and reprint collections of the First Comics issues, and would also publish a complete collection of &quot;Mars&quot;. In 2007 IDW also started reprinting &quot;Badger&quot; as well as starting a new series. IDW also reprinted the four Oz stories by Eric Shanower originally published as issues of &quot;First Graphic Novel&quot; as &quot;Adventures in Oz&quot;. &quot;First Graphic Novel&quot; also featured colorized reprints of early issues of the original &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series.

<doc id="619097" wikidata="Q138894" url="?curid=619097" title="Cressy-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Cressy&quot;-class cruiser was a class of six armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy around 1900. Their design&#x27;s incorporation of a pair of 9.2-inch guns and armoured sides served to address criticism directed against the previous — advances made possible by their 1,000 ton increase in displacement over their predecessors. The ships were notably stable, except for a susceptibility to pitching.

==Service==
Until 1908, the ships served in Home waters, the Mediterranean and the Far East. On the outbreak of the First World War &quot;Cressy&quot;, &quot;Aboukir&quot;, &quot;Hogue&quot;, &quot;Bacchante&quot; and &quot;Euryalus&quot; formed the Seventh Cruiser Squadron. Due to the obsolescence of the ships and because they were crewed by inexperienced reservists the squadron was known as the &quot;Live Bait Squadron&quot;. This epithet proved prophetic when &quot;Cressy&quot;, &quot;Hogue&quot; and &quot;Aboukir&quot; were sunk in a single action on 22 September 1914 by the German submarine &quot;U-9&quot; near the Dutch coast. After the first cruiser had been hit, the following cruisers both came to a dead halt to pick up survivors, making themselves easy targets for torpedoes.

==Ships==

*HMS &quot;Cressy&quot;: launched 4 December 1899, torpedoed and sunk 22 September 1914
*HMS &quot;Sutlej&quot;: launched 18 November 1899, scrapped 9 May 1921
*HMS &quot;Aboukir&quot;: launched 16 May 1900, torpedoed and sunk 22 September 1914
*HMS &quot;Hogue&quot;: launched 13 August 1900, torpedoed and sunk 22 September 1914
*HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot;: launched 21 February 1901, scrapped 1 July 1920
*HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;: launched 20 May 1901, scrapped 1 July 1920

==Building Programme==

The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the &quot;Cressy&quot; class. Standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores. The compilers of The Naval Annual revised costs quoted for British ships between the 1905 and 1906 editions.

<doc id="619114" wikidata="Q7523769" url="?curid=619114" title="Single-serving visitor pattern">
<text>In computer programming, the single-serving visitor pattern is a design pattern. Its intent is to optimise the implementation of a visitor that is allocated, used only once, and then deleted (which is the case of most visitors).

== Applicability ==

The single-serving visitor pattern should be used when visitors do not need to remain in memory. This is often the case when visiting a hierarchy of objects (such as when the visitor pattern is used together with the composite pattern) to perform a single task on it, for example counting the number of cameras in a 3D scene.

The regular visitor pattern should be used when the visitor must remain in memory. This occurs when the visitor is configured with a number of parameters that must be kept in memory for a later use of the visitor (for example, for storing the rendering options of a 3D scene renderer).

However, if there should be only one instance of such a visitor in a whole program, it can be a good idea to implement it both as a single-serving visitor and as a singleton. In doing so, it is ensured that the single-serving visitor can be called later with its parameters unchanged (in this particular case &quot;single-serving visitor&quot; is an abuse of language since the visitor can be used several times).

==Usage examples==

The single-serving visitor is called through the intermediate of static methods.

* Without parameters:
 Element* elem;
 SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(elem);

* With parameters:
 Element* elem;
 TYPE param1, param2;
 SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(elem, param1, param2);

* Implementation as a singleton:
 Element* elem;
 TYPE param1, param2;
 SingleServingVisitor::set_param1(param1);
 SingleServingVisitor::set_param2(param2);
 SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(elem);
==Consequences==

===Pros===
* &quot;No &quot;zombie&quot; objects&quot;. With a single-serving visitor, it is ensured that visitors are allocated when needed and destroyed once useless.
* &quot;A simpler interface than visitor&quot;. The visitor is created, used and free by the sole call of the &quot;apply_to&quot; static method.

===Cons===
* &quot;Repeated allocation&quot;. At each call of the &quot;apply_to&quot; method, a single-serving visitor is created then discarded, which is time-consuming. In contrast, the singleton only performs one allocation.

==Implementation (in C++)==

=== Basic implementation (without parameters) ===
// Declaration
class Element;
class ElementA;
class ElementB;
class SingleServingVisitor;

... // Same as with the visitor pattern.

// Definition
class SingleServingVisitor {
protected:
 SingleServingVisitor();
public:
 ~SingleServingVisitor();

 static void apply_to(Element*);
 virtual void visit_ElementA(ElementA*) = 0;
 virtual void visit_ElementB(ElementB*) = 0;

// Implementation
void SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(Element* elem) 
 SingleServingVisitor ssv;
 elem.accept(ssv);


===Passing parameters===

If the single-serving visitor has to be initialised, the parameters have to be passed through the static method:
void SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(Element* elem, TYPE param1, TYPE param2, ...) 
 SingleServingVisitor ssv(param1, param2, ...);
 elem.accept(&amp;ssv);


=== Implementation as a singleton===

This implementation ensures:
* that there is at most one instance of the single-serving visitor
* that the visitor can be accessed later
// Definition
class SingleServingVisitor {
protected:
 static SingleServingVisitor* instance_;
 TYPE param1_;
 TYPE param2_;

 SingleServingVisitor();

 static SingleServingVisitor* get_instance();
 // Note: get_instance method does not need to be public

public:
 ~SingleServingVisitor();

 static void apply_to(Element*);

 // static methods to access parameters
 static void set_param1(TYPE);
 static void set_param2(TYPE);

 virtual void visit_ElementA(ElementA*) = 0;
 virtual void visit_ElementB(ElementB*) = 0;

// Implementation
SingleServingVisitor* SingleServingVisitor::instance_ = NULL;

SingleServingVisitor* SingleServingVisitor::get_instance() 
 if (this-&gt;instance_ == NULL)
 this-&gt;instance_ = new SingleServingVisitor();
 return this-&gt;instance_;

void SingleServingVisitor::apply_to(Element* elem) 
 elem-&gt;accept(get_instance());

void SingleServingVisitor::set_param1(TYPE param1) 
 getInstance()-&gt;param1_ = param1;

void SingleServingVisitor::set_param2(TYPE param2) 
 getInstance()-&gt;param2_ = param2;

* Composite pattern: single-serving visitor is often applied to hierarchies of elements

<doc id="619115" wikidata="Q7398976" url="?curid=619115" title="Sagamore Hill">
<text>Sagamore Hill was the home of the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, from 1885 until his death in 1919. It is located in Cove Neck, New York, near Oyster Bay on the North Shore of Long Island, east of Manhattan. It is now the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, which includes the Theodore Roosevelt Museum in a later building on the grounds.

==History==

A native of New York City, Theodore Roosevelt spent many summers of his youth on extended vacations with his family in the Oyster Bay area. In 1880, 22-year-old Roosevelt purchased of land for $30,000 (equal to $ today) on Cove Neck, a small peninsula roughly northeast of the hamlet of Oyster Bay. In 1881, his uncle James A. Roosevelt had an estate home built several hundred feet west of the Sagamore Hill property.

In 1884, Theodore Roosevelt hired the New York architectural firm of Lamb &amp; Rich to design a shingle-style, Queen Anne home for the property. The 22-room house building commenced in May, 1884, completed by John A. Wood and Son, of Lawrence, Long Island, in March, 1885 for $16,975 (equal to $ today). Roosevelt stayed there in the summer of 1885 with his sister and daughter for the hunts and moved into the house with second wife Edith in March, 1887. Roosevelt had originally planned to name the house &quot;Leeholm&quot; after his wife, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt. However, she died in 1884 and Roosevelt remarried in 1886, so he decided to change the name to &quot;Sagamore Hill&quot;. &quot;Sagamore&quot; is the Algonquin word for chieftain, the head of the tribe.

In 1905, Roosevelt expanded the house, adding the largest room, called the &quot;North Room&quot; to a design by C. Grant LaFarge (), for $19,000 (equal to $ today). The North Room is furnished with trophies from the former president&#x27;s hunts and gifts from foreign dignitaries, alongside pieces of art and books from the Roosevelts&#x27; collection. The home then had
23 rooms, including a water closet with a porcelain tub, which was a luxury at the time of its construction.

The house and its surrounding farmland became the primary residence of Theodore and Edith Roosevelt for the rest of their lives and the birthplace of three of their five children (Theodore Jr., Kermit and Ethel). Sagamore Hill took on its greatest importance when it became known as the &quot;Summer White House&quot; during the seven summers (1902–1908) that Roosevelt spent there as President. It played host to numerous visits from foreign dignitaries and peace talks that helped draw an end to the Russo-Japanese War. Roosevelt died at Sagamore Hill on January 6, 1919, and he was buried at nearby Youngs Memorial Cemetery.

On July 25, 1962, Congress established Sagamore Hill National Historic Site to preserve the house as a unit of the National Park Service. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, Sagamore Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

The interior of the home is viewable by ticketed tour and almost all of the furnishings are original. The grounds are open to the public and admission is free. Also on the site is the Theodore Roosevelt Museum, which chronicles the life and career of the President. The museum is housed in the 1938 house called &quot;Old Orchard&quot;, the former residence of Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and his family which was designed by William G. McMillan, Jr. Sagamore Hill was closed for about 4 years (from 2011 to 2015) to allow for restoration work to take place. The Sagamore Hill visitor center was destroyed by a fire on Christmas Eve 2018; no one was injured, as Sagamore Hill was closed due to the government shutdown.

==In popular culture==
Asteroid 218679 Sagamorehill, discovered by Richard Kowalski in 2005, was named for the home of former US President Theodore Roosevelt. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on January 9, 2020 ().

<text>A trophy is a tangible, decorative item used to remind of a specific achievement, serving as recognition or evidence of merit. Trophies are most commonly awarded for sporting events, ranging from youth sports to professional level athletics. Additionally, trophies are presented for achievements in Academic, Arts and Entertainment, Business, Military, Professional awards, Community Service, Hunting, and Environmental accomplishments. In many contexts, especially in sports, medals (or, in North America, rings) are often given out either as the trophy or along with more traditional trophies.

Originally the word trophy, derived from the Greek &quot;tropaion&quot;, referred to arms, standards, other property, or human captives and body parts (e.g., headhunting) captured in battle. These war trophies commemorated the military victories of a state, army or individual combatant. In modern warfare trophy taking is discouraged, but this sense of the word is reflected in hunting trophies and human trophy collecting by serial killers.

== Etymology ==

Trophies have marked victories since ancient times. The word &quot;trophy&quot;, coined in English in 1550, was derived from the French &quot;trophée&quot; in 1513, &quot;a prize of war&quot;, from Old French &quot;trophee&quot;, from Latin &quot;trophaeum&quot;, monument to victory, variant of &quot;tropaeum&quot;, which in turn is the latinisation of the Greek τρόπαιον (&quot;tropaion&quot;), the neuter of (&quot;tropaios&quot;), &quot;of defeat&quot; or &quot;for defeat&quot;, but generally &quot;of a turning&quot; or &quot;of a change&quot;, from τροπή (&quot;tropē&quot;), &quot;a turn, a change&quot; and that from the verb τρέπω (&quot;trepo&quot;), &quot;to turn, to alter&quot;.

In ancient Greece, trophies were made on the battlefields of victorious battles, from captured arms and standards, and were hung upon a tree or a large stake made to resemble a warrior. Often, these ancient trophies were inscribed with a story of the battle and were dedicated to various gods. Trophies made about naval victories sometimes consisted of entire ships (or what remained of them) laid out on the beach. To destroy a trophy was considered a sacrilege.

The ancient Romans kept their trophies closer to home. The Romans built magnificent trophies in Rome, including columns and arches atop a foundation. Most of the stone trophies that once adorned huge stone memorials in Rome have been long since stolen.

==History==
In ancient Greece, the winners of the Olympic games initially received no trophies except laurel wreaths. Later the winner also received an amphora with sacred olive oil. In local games, the winners received different trophies, such as a tripod vase, a bronze shield or a silver cup.

In ancient Rome, money usually was given to winners instead of trophies.

Chalices were given to winners of sporting events at least as early as the very late 1600s in the New World. For example, the Kyp Cup (made by silversmith Jesse Kyp), a small, two-handled, sterling cup in the Henry Ford Museum, was given to the winner of a horse race between two towns in New England in about 1699. Chalices, particularly, are associated with sporting events, and were traditionally made in silver. Winners of horse races, and later boating and early automobile races, were the typical recipients of these trophies. The Davis Cup, Stanley Cup, America&#x27;s Cup and numerous World Cups are all now famous cup-shaped trophies given to sports winners.

Today, the most common trophies are much less expensive, and thus much more pervasive, thanks to mass-produced plastic/resin trophies.

The oldest sports trophies in the world are the Carlisle Bells, a horse racing trophy dating back to 1559 and 1599 and were first awarded by Elizabeth I. The race has been run for over 400 years in Carlisle, Cumbria, United Kingdom. The bells are on show at the local museum, Tullie House, which houses a variety of historic artifacts from the area from Roman legions to present day.

==Types==

Contemporary trophies often depict an aspect of the event commemorated, for example in basketball tournaments, the trophy takes the shape of a basketball player, or a basketball. Trophies have been in the past objects of use such as two-handled cups, bowls, or mugs (all usually engraved); or representations such as statues of people, animals, and architecture while displaying words, numbers or images. While trophies traditionally have been made with metal figures, wood columns, and wood bases, in recent years they have been made with plastic figures and marble bases. This is to retain the weight traditionally associated with a quality award and make them more affordable to use as recognition items. Trophies increasingly have used resin depictions.

The Academy Awards Oscar is a trophy with a stylized human; the Hugo Award for science fiction is a space ship; and the Wimbledon awards for its singles champions are a large loving cup for men and a large silver plate for women. Some motor races such as the Monaco Grand Prix use stylized depictions of the track layout for its trophy.

A loving-cup trophy is a common variety of trophy; it is a cup shape, usually on a pedestal, with two or more handles, and is often made from silver or silver plate.

Hunting trophies are reminders of successes from hunting animals, such as an animal&#x27;s head mounted to be hung on a wall. These can be examples of taxidermy, where the full animal is stuffed; and put out for show.

Perpetual trophies are held by the winner until the next event, when the winner must compete again in order to keep the trophy. In some competitions winners of a certain number of consecutive or non-consecutive events receive the trophy or its copy in permanent ownership. This was particularly common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and led to the discontinuation of many trophy events when the trophy was won permanently and the event organizers could not or would not purchase a new one.

==Sporting==
Trophies have been awarded for team, or individual accomplishments in sports. Many combat sports, such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling use championship belts as trophies; however, unlike most of the trophies mentioned below, a new one is not created every time a new champion is crowned; rather, the new champion takes the belt from the old one.

===Association football===
Trophies in the sport include: 

*Copa Libertadores Trophy — Known simply as &quot;Libertadores&quot; or &quot;Copa&quot;, awarded to the winners of the Copa Libertadores since 1960. It is one of the most prestigious laurels in the Western Hemisphere.
*The FA Cup — Awarded to winners of the primary English domestic football knockout tournament, officially &quot;The Football Association Challenge Cup&quot;, often referred to as just the &quot;FA Cup&quot;. The FA Cup was inaugurated in 1871 and is therefore the oldest tournament in club football. The original trophy, however, was stolen in 1895 and the current trophy design, which was first awarded in 1911, is actually the fifth incarnation in total.
* The Women&#x27;s FA Cup – Awarded to winners of the primary English women&#x27;s domestic football knockout tournament. Inaugurated in 1971, it was one of the first prestigious trophies to be made by the Thomas Lyte silver workshop.
* FIFA World Cup Trophy — Awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from the 1974 FIFA World Cup onwards. Previous winners were awarded the Jules Rimet Trophy (known simply as &quot;Victory&quot; until 1949), which was awarded in perpetuity to Brazil after their 3rd win in the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Both are referred to colloquially as &quot;the World Cup&quot;
* FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Winner&#x27;s Trophy – Awarded to the winners of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup from the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup onwards. Unlike the men&#x27;s World Cup trophy, the women&#x27;s trophy is constructed anew for each champion to keep.
*European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup – colloquially &quot;the European Cup&quot;, awarded to the winners of the European Cup (before 1992–93) and the UEFA Champions League (since 1992–93). It is the most prestigious trophy in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is affectionately known as &quot;old big ears&quot; due to its shape.
*Philip F. Anschutz Trophy – Awarded to the winners of the MLS Cup, the MLS&#x27; championship game
*UEFA Super Cup — Awarded to the winners of a one-off match between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.
*The Scottish Cup — Awarded to the winners of the primary domestic knockout cup tournament of Scotland (the &quot;Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup&quot;, or just &quot;Scottish Cup&quot;). The tournament was founded in 1873 and still presents the original trophy. The Scottish Cup is therefore the world&#x27;s oldest national football trophy and second oldest national trophy, behind the Carlisle Bells race trophy dating back to 1599.

Other notable trophies in the sport includes the Jules Rimet Trophy. The original was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and has never been recovered. Replicas were awarded to winning nations up to the retirement of the genuine trophy. However, prior to the 1966 final, The Football Association made an (unauthorised) replica in secret in gilded bronze for use in post-match celebrations due to security concerns – the genuine trophy was made out of close to 2 kg of pure gold. This has led to several conspiracy theories regarding which trophy was stolen – the FA replica, or the real trophy. FIFA purchased the replica for £254,500 (ten times the reserve price) in 1997, with the inflated price attributed to such rumours. This trophy is held on behalf of FIFA by the National Football Museum in Preston. The current FIFA World Cup trophy inscribe the names of the teams that won the award underneath the base of the trophy.

A club that manages to win the Copa Libertadores trophy three consecutive times retain the trophy permanently. The current trophy has been used since 1975. Like the FIFA World Cup trophy, the winners of each edition of the tournament has their name inscribed on the trophy; unlike the FIFA World Cup trophy, a pedestal contains a list of winners in the form of badges. The current pedestal is the fourth in the trophy&#x27;s history, having been used since 2009. The original trophy was awarded to Estudiantes de La Plata in 1970 (after their third win) – the present trophy is the third, identical edition.

Until 2009, clubs that win the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup three times in successive seasons, or five times in total, were permitted to retain the trophy in perpetuity. The present trophy has been used since 2005–06 after Liverpool&#x27;s fifth win in 2005. The original trophy was awarded to Real Madrid in 1966 (after their sixth win) — the present trophy is the sixth incarnation overall.

Four trophies have served as an award (out of five made) for the winner of the FA Cup. The first (1871–1895) was stolen in Birmingham and melted down, the second (1896–1910) was presented to Lord Kinnaird and is held by David Gold, the chairman of Birmingham City after private auction in 2005. The third (1910–1992) was retired after the 1992 final due to fragility and is held by The Football Association; two exact replicas of it were made, one of which has been awarded to the winners (1993–2013), the other remains as a backup in case of damage to the primary trophy. The same design was recast and was unveiled in 2014 to be more durable.

<doc id="619123" wikidata="Q1797170" url="?curid=619123" title="HMS Bacchante (1901)">
<text>HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot; was a armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy around 1900. Upon completion she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet as flagship of the fleet&#x27;s cruiser squadron. She was reduced to reserve upon her return home in 1905 before returning to the Mediterranean in 1906. Six years later she returned home and was again placed in reserve. Recommissioned at the start of World War I, &quot;Bacchante&quot; became flagship of the 7th Cruiser Squadron. She was present at the Battle of Heligoland Bight a few weeks after the war began, but saw no combat.

She was transferred to convoy escort duties in the Bay of Biscay in late 1914 before being sent to Egypt in early 1915. &quot;Bacchante&quot; was then assigned to support Anzac troops during the Gallipoli Campaign by providing naval gunfire. She covered the landing at Anzac Cove in April as well as several subsequent operations. Returning home in late 1916, she became the flagship of the 9th Cruiser Squadron on convoy escort duties off the African coast in mid-1917. &quot;Bacchante&quot; remained there for the rest of the war and was reduced to reserve in 1919 before being sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design and description==
&quot;Bacchante&quot; was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 30 Belleville boilers. On their sea trials all of the &quot;Cressy&quot;-class cruisers, except the lead ship, exceeded their designed speed. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement ranged from 725 to 760 officers and ratings.

Her main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in single gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. They fired shells to a range of . Her secondary armament of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells. A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats, eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure. The ship also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Bacchante&quot;, named after the female devotees of the Greek god Bacchus, was laid down by John Brown &amp; Company at their shipyard in Clydebank on 15 February 1899 and launched on 21 February 1901. She arrived at Chatham Dockyard the following October, to be equipped and prepared for her steam and gunnery trials and was completed in November 1902. Upon completion, she was commissioned by Captain Frederic Brock on 25 November 1902 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet as flagship of its cruiser squadron, replacing . On arrival in the Mediterranean, Brock changed places on 20 December with Captain Christopher Cradock, who had until then been in command of &quot;Andromeda&quot;. &quot;Bacchante&quot; remained in the Mediterranean under Cradock&#x27;s command until 1905 when she returned home and was placed in reserve. She returned there in 1906 for service with the 3rd and later the 6th Cruiser Squadrons, and in January 1907 her command was given to William Ruck-Keene, who held it until October 1910.

The Census 1911 reveals her in the Mediterranean under the Flag of Rear Admiral Douglas Gamble and captained (Flag Captain) by Reginald Tyrwhitt. Gamble&#x27;s Flag Lieutenant was Bertram Ramsay.

Upon returning home in 1912, the ship was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet.

At the outbreak of the war in August 1914, &quot;Bacchante&quot; became the flagship of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was flagship of Rear Admiral Henry Campbell commanding Cruiser Force &#x27;C&#x27;, in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action. After the sinking of &quot;Bacchante&quot;″s three sister ships while patrolling the Broad Fourteens on 22 September, she, and her sister , were transferred to the 12th Cruiser Squadron to escort ships between England and Gibraltar in early October.

&quot;Bacchante&quot; and &quot;Euryalus&quot; were transferred to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed by the time that they arrived in February. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred and the sisters were transferred north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.

During the landing at Anzac Cove during the Battle of Gallipoli on 25 April, &quot;Bacchante&quot; suppressed Turkish artillery positions at Gaba Tepe after touching her bow the beach for a better position from which to engage the guns. She provided fire support for forces near Anzac Cove for the next several months, particularly during the Third attack on Anzac Cove on 19 May when she, together with three pre-dreadnought battleships, effectively suppressed the Turkish artillery assigned to support the attack. On 28 May &quot;Bacchante&quot; and the destroyer destroyed enemy shipping in Bodrum harbour. Three months later the cruiser bombarded Turkish troops during the Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August and Battle of Chunuk Bair 7–9 August. She was not present when the Allies began to evacuate Gallipoli in December, but her captain, Algernon Boyle, commanded the evacuation at Anzac Cove.

She remained in the Mediterranean until late 1916 when she returned home. She was damaged in a collision with the armoured cruiser in the Irish Sea in February 1917. After repairs she became flagship of the 9th Cruiser Squadron at Sierra Leone from April 1917 to November 1918. &quot;Bacchante&quot; was paid off at Chatham in April 1919 and sold for scrap on 1 July 1920.

<doc id="619124" wikidata="Q337175" url="?curid=619124" title="Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate">
<text>Mark Oliver Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate, (born 20 March 1936) is a British judge and former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Saville was born on 20 March 1936 to Kenneth Vivian Saville and Olivia Sarah Frances Gray, and educated at Rye Grammar School. He undertook National Service in the Royal Sussex Regiment between 1954 and 1956 at the rank of second lieutenant. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating with first class honours in law (Bachelor of Arts) and a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, and where he won the Vinerian Scholarship. He was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1962, becoming a bencher in 1983, and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1975. He co-edited &quot;Essays in Honour of Sir Brian Neill: the Quintessential Judge&quot; with Richard Susskind, former Gresham Professor of Law, and contributed to &quot;Civil Court Service 2007&quot;.

==Judicial career==
Saville was appointed a judge of the High Court in 1985 and, as is tradition, was knighted at this time. In 1994, he became a Lord Justice of Appeal, a judge of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, and was appointed to the Privy Council, affording him the style, &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. On 28 July 1997, he replaced Lord Mustill as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, receiving a life peerage as Baron Saville of Newdigate of Newdigate in the County of Surrey. He and nine other Lords of Appeal in Ordinary became Justices of the Supreme Court upon that body&#x27;s inauguration on 1 October 2009. He sat as a crossbencher. On 10 July 2024, it was announced that Saville had retired from the House of Lords with effect from the 20 June 2024.

Between 1994 and 1996 Saville chaired a committee on arbitration law that led to the Arbitration Act 1996.

In 1997 Saville received an honorary LL.D. from London Guildhall University.

Since 2006 he has held the post of President of The Academy of Experts.

==Bloody Sunday Inquiry==
On 29 January 1998, Lord Saville of Newdigate was appointed to chair the second Bloody Sunday Inquiry, a public inquiry commissioned by Prime Minister Tony Blair into Bloody Sunday, an incident in 1972 in Derry, Northern Ireland, when 27 people were shot by members of the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, resulting in 14 deaths. The previous inquiry, the Widgery Tribunal, had been described by Irish nationalists as a whitewash. Other members of the panel were Sir Edward Somers, former judge of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, and William Lloyd Hoyt, former Chief Justice of New Brunswick.

The report was published on 15 June 2010.
British Prime Minister David Cameron addressed the House of Commons that afternoon where he acknowledged that the paratroopers had fired the first shot, had fired on fleeing unarmed civilians, and shot and killed one man who was already wounded. He then apologised on behalf of the British Government. The inquiry came into controversy for attempts to force journalists Alex Thomson, Lena Ferguson and Toby Harnden to disclose their sources, for its 12-year duration and for its final cost of £195 million.

==Personal life==
Lord Saville of Newdigate married Jill Gray in 1961, with whom he has two sons (William Christian Saville and Henry Saville). He enjoys sailing, flying and computers, and is a member of the Garrick Club in London.

<text>The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. Propagation of the genetic material between generations requires timely and accurate duplication of DNA by semiconservative replication prior to cell division to ensure each daughter cell receives the full complement of chromosomes. This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses. Synthesis of daughter strands starts at discrete sites, termed replication origins, and proceeds in a bidirectional manner until all genomic DNA is replicated. Despite the fundamental nature of these events, organisms have evolved surprisingly divergent strategies that control replication onset. Although the specific replication origin organization structure and recognition varies from species to species, some common characteristics are shared.

== Features ==
A key prerequisite for DNA replication is that it must occur with extremely high fidelity and efficiency exactly once per cell cycle to prevent the accumulation of genetic alterations with potentially deleterious consequences for cell survival and organismal viability. Incomplete, erroneous, or untimely DNA replication events can give rise to mutations, chromosomal polyploidy or aneuploidy, and gene copy number variations, each of which in turn can lead to diseases, including cancer. To ensure complete and accurate duplication of the entire genome and the correct flow of genetic information to progeny cells, all DNA replication events are not only tightly regulated with cell cycle cues but are also coordinated with other cellular events such as transcription and DNA repair. Additionally, origin sequences commonly have high AT-content across all kingdoms, since repeats of adenine and thymine are easier to separate because their base stacking interactions are not as strong as those of guanine and cytosine.

DNA replication is divided into different stages. During initiation, the replication machineries – termed replisomes – are assembled on DNA in a bidirectional fashion. These assembly loci constitute the start sites of DNA replication or replication origins. In the elongation phase, replisomes travel in opposite directions with the replication forks, unwinding the DNA helix and synthesizing complementary daughter DNA strands using both parental strands as templates. Once replication is complete, specific termination events lead to the disassembly of replisomes. As long as the entire genome is duplicated before cell division, one might assume that the location of replication start sites does not matter; yet, it has been shown that many organisms use preferred genomic regions as origins. The necessity to regulate origin location likely arises from the need to coordinate DNA replication with other processes that act on the shared chromatin template to avoid DNA strand breaks and DNA damage.

== Replicon model ==
More than five decades ago, Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin proposed the replicon hypothesis to explain the regulation of chromosomal DNA synthesis in &quot;E. coli&quot;. The model postulates that a diffusible, &quot;trans&quot;-acting factor, a so-called initiator, interacts with a &quot;cis&quot;-acting DNA element, the replicator, to promote replication onset at a nearby origin. Once bound to replicators, initiators (often with the help of co-loader proteins) deposit replicative helicases onto DNA, which subsequently drive the recruitment of additional replisome components and the assembly of the entire replication machinery. The replicator thereby specifies the location of replication initiation events, and the chromosome region that is replicated from a single origin or initiation event is defined as the replicon.

A fundamental feature of the replicon hypothesis is that it relies on positive regulation to control DNA replication onset, which can explain many experimental observations in bacterial and phage systems. For example, it accounts for the failure of extrachromosomal DNAs without origins to replicate when introduced into host cells. It further rationalizes plasmid incompatibilities in E. coli, where certain plasmids destabilize each other&#x27;s inheritance due to competition for the same molecular initiation machinery. By contrast, a model of negative regulation (analogous to the replicon-operator model for transcription) fails to explain the above findings. Nonetheless, research subsequent to Jacob&#x27;s, Brenner&#x27;s and Cuzin&#x27;s proposal of the replicon model has discovered many additional layers of replication control in bacteria and eukaryotes that comprise both positive and negative regulatory elements, highlighting both the complexity and the importance of restricting DNA replication temporally and spatially.

The concept of the replicator as a genetic entity has proven very useful in the quest to identify replicator DNA sequences and initiator proteins in prokaryotes, and to some extent also in eukaryotes, although the organization and complexity of replicators differ considerably between the domains of life. While bacterial genomes typically contain a single replicator that is specified by consensus DNA sequence elements and that controls replication of the entire chromosome, most eukaryotic replicators – with the exception of budding yeast – are not defined at the level of DNA sequence; instead, they appear to be specified combinatorially by local DNA structural and chromatin cues. Eukaryotic chromosomes are also much larger than their bacterial counterparts, raising the need for initiating DNA synthesis from many origins simultaneously to ensure timely replication of the entire genome. Additionally, many more replicative helicases are loaded than activated to initiate replication in a given cell cycle. The context-driven definition of replicators and selection of origins suggests a relaxed replicon model in eukaryotic systems that allows for flexibility in the DNA replication program. Although replicators and origins can be spaced physically apart on chromosomes, they often co-localize or are located in close proximity; for simplicity, we will thus refer to both elements as ‘origins’ throughout this review. Taken together, the discovery and isolation of origin sequences in various organisms represents a significant milestone towards gaining mechanistic understanding of replication initiation. In addition, these accomplishments had profound biotechnological implications for the development of shuttle vectors that can be propagated in bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells.

== Bacterial==

Most bacterial chromosomes are circular and contain a single origin of chromosomal replication (&quot;oriC&quot;). Bacterial &quot;oriC&quot; regions are surprisingly diverse in size (ranging from 250 bp to 2 kbp), sequence, and organization; nonetheless, their ability to drive replication onset typically depends on sequence-specific readout of consensus DNA elements by the bacterial initiator, a protein called DnaA. Origins in bacteria are either continuous or bipartite and contain three functional elements that control origin activity: conserved DNA repeats that are specifically recognized by DnaA (called DnaA-boxes), an AT-rich DNA unwinding element (DUE), and binding sites for proteins that help regulate replication initiation. Interactions of DnaA both with the double-stranded (ds) DnaA-box regions and with single-stranded (ss) DNA in the DUE are important for origin activation and are mediated by different domains in the initiator protein: a Helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding element and an ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) domain, respectively. While the sequence, number, and arrangement of origin-associated DnaA-boxes vary throughout the bacterial kingdom, their specific positioning and spacing in a given species are critical for &quot;oriC&quot; function and for productive initiation complex formation.

Among bacteria, &quot;E. coli&quot; is a particularly powerful model system to study the organization, recognition, and activation mechanism of replication origins. &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;oriC&quot; comprises an approximately ~260 bp region containing four types of initiator binding elements that differ in their affinities for DnaA and their dependencies on the co-factor ATP. DnaA-boxes R1, R2, and R4 constitute high-affinity sites that are bound by the HTH domain of DnaA irrespective of the nucleotide-binding state of the initiator. By contrast, the I, τ, and C-sites, which are interspersed between the R-sites, are low-affinity DnaA-boxes and associate preferentially with ATP-bound DnaA, although ADP-DnaA can substitute for ATP-DnaA under certain conditions. Binding of the HTH domains to the high- and low-affinity DnaA recognition elements promotes ATP-dependent higher-order oligomerization of DnaA&#x27;s AAA+ modules into a right-handed filament that wraps duplex DNA around its outer surface, thereby generating superhelical torsion that facilitates melting of the adjacent AT-rich DUE. DNA strand separation is additionally aided by direct interactions of DnaA&#x27;s AAA+ ATPase domain with triplet repeats, so-called DnaA-trios, in the proximal DUE region. The engagement of single-stranded trinucleotide segments by the initiator filament stretches DNA and stabilizes the initiation bubble by preventing reannealing. The DnaA-trio origin element is conserved in many bacterial species, indicating it is a key element for origin function. After melting, the DUE provides an entry site for the &quot;E. coli&quot; replicative helicase DnaB, which is deposited onto each of the single DNA strands by its loader protein DnaC.

Although the different DNA binding activities of DnaA have been extensively studied biochemically and various &quot;apo&quot;, ssDNA-, or dsDNA-bound structures have been determined, the exact architecture of the higher-order DnaA-&quot;oriC&quot; initiation assembly remains unclear. Two models have been proposed to explain the organization of essential origin elements and DnaA-mediated &quot;oriC&quot; melting. The two-state model assumes a continuous DnaA filament that switches from a dsDNA binding mode (the organizing complex) to an ssDNA binding mode in the DUE (the melting complex). By contrast, in the loop-back model, the DNA is sharply bent in &quot;oriC&quot; and folds back onto the initiator filament so that DnaA protomers simultaneously engage double- and single-stranded DNA regions. Elucidating how exactly &quot;oriC&quot; DNA is organized by DnaA remains thus an important task for future studies. Insights into initiation complex architecture will help explain not only how origin DNA is melted, but also how a replicative helicase is loaded directionally onto each of the exposed single DNA strands in the unwound DUE, and how these events are aided by interactions of the helicase with the initiator and specific loader proteins.

== Archaeal ==
Archaeal replication origins share some but not all of the organizational features of bacterial &quot;oriC&quot;. Unlike bacteria, Archaea often initiate replication from multiple origins per chromosome (one to four have been reported); yet, archaeal origins also bear specialized sequence regions that control origin function. These elements include both DNA sequence-specific origin recognition boxes (ORBs or miniORBs) and an AT-rich DUE that is flanked by one or several ORB regions. ORB elements display a considerable degree of diversity in terms of their number, arrangement, and sequence, both among different archaeal species and among different origins in a single species. An additional degree of complexity is introduced by the initiator, Orc1/Cdc6 in archaea, which binds to ORB regions. Archaeal genomes typically encode multiple paralogs of Orc1/Cdc6 that vary substantially in their affinities for distinct ORB elements and that differentially contribute to origin activities. In &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot;, for example, three chromosomal origins have been mapped (oriC1, oriC2, and oriC3), and biochemical studies have revealed complex binding patterns of initiators at these sites. The cognate initiator for oriC1 is Orc1-1, which associates with several ORBs at this origin. OriC2 and oriC3 are bound by both Orc1-1 and Orc1-3. Conversely, a third paralog, Orc1-2, footprints at all three origins but has been postulated to negatively regulate replication initiation. Additionally, the WhiP protein, an initiator unrelated to Orc1/Cdc6, has been shown to bind all origins as well and to drive origin activity of oriC3 in the closely related &quot;Sulfolobus islandicus&quot;. Because archaeal origins often contain several adjacent ORB elements, multiple Orc1/Cdc6 paralogs can be simultaneously recruited to an origin and oligomerize in some instances; however, in contrast to bacterial DnaA, formation of a higher-order initiator assembly does not appear to be a general prerequisite for origin function in the archaeal domain.
Structural studies have provided insights into how archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 recognizes ORB elements and remodels origin DNA. Orc1/Cdc6 paralogs are two-domain proteins and are composed of a AAA+ ATPase module fused to a C-terminal winged-helix fold. DNA-complexed structures of Orc1/Cdc6 revealed that ORBs are bound by an Orc1/Cdc6 monomer despite the presence of inverted repeat sequences within ORB elements. Both the ATPase and winged-helix regions interact with the DNA duplex but contact the palindromic ORB repeat sequence asymmetrically, which orients Orc1/Cdc6 in a specific direction on the repeat. Interestingly, the DUE-flanking ORB or miniORB elements often have opposite polarities, which predicts that the AAA+ lid subdomains and the winged-helix domains of Orc1/Cdc6 are positioned on either side of the DUE in a manner where they face each other. Since both regions of Orc1/Cdc6 associate with a minichromosome maintenance (MCM) replicative helicase, this specific arrangement of ORB elements and Orc1/Cdc6 is likely important for loading two MCM complexes symmetrically onto the DUE. Surprisingly, while the ORB DNA sequence determines the directionality of Orc1/Cdc6 binding, the initiator makes relatively few sequence-specific contacts with DNA. However, Orc1/Cdc6 severely underwinds and bends DNA, suggesting that it relies on a mix of both DNA sequence and context-dependent DNA structural features to recognize origins. Notably, base pairing is maintained in the distorted DNA duplex upon Orc1/Cdc6 binding in the crystal structures, whereas biochemical studies have yielded contradictory findings as to whether archaeal initiators can melt DNA similarly to bacterial DnaA. Although the evolutionary kinship of archaeal and eukaryotic initiators and replicative helicases indicates that archaeal MCM is likely loaded onto duplex DNA (see next section), the temporal order of origin melting and helicase loading, as well as the mechanism for origin DNA melting, in archaeal systems remains therefore to be clearly established. Likewise, how exactly the MCM helicase is loaded onto DNA needs to be addressed in future studies.

== Eukaryotic ==
Origin organization, specification, and activation in eukaryotes are more complex than in bacterial or archaeal domains and significantly deviate from the paradigm established for prokaryotic replication initiation. The large genome sizes of eukaryotic cells, which range from 12 Mbp in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; to more than 100 Gbp in some plants, necessitates that DNA replication starts at several hundred (in budding yeast) to tens of thousands (in humans) origins to complete DNA replication of all chromosomes during each cell cycle. With the exception of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; and related &quot;Saccharomycotina&quot; species, eukaryotic origins do not contain consensus DNA sequence elements but their location is influenced by contextual cues such as local DNA topology, DNA structural features, and chromatin environment. 

Eukaryotic origin function relies on a conserved initiator protein complex to load replicative helicases onto DNA during the late M and G1 phases of the cell cycle, a step known as origin licensing. In contrast to their bacterial counterparts, replicative helicases in eukaryotes are loaded onto origin duplex DNA in an inactive, double-hexameric form and only a subset of them (10-20% in mammalian cells) is activated during any given S phase, events that are referred to as origin firing.

The location of active eukaryotic origins is therefore determined on at least two different levels, origin licensing to mark all potential origins, and origin firing to select a subset that permits assembly of the replication machinery and initiation of DNA synthesis. The extra licensed origins serve as backup and are activated only upon slowing or stalling of nearby replication forks, ensuring that DNA replication can be completed when cells encounter replication stress. In the absence of stress, firing of extra origins is suppressed by a replication-associated signaling mechanism. Together, the excess of licensed origins and the tight cell cycle control of origin licensing and firing embody two important strategies to prevent under- and overreplication and to maintain the integrity of eukaryotic genomes.

Early studies in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; indicated that replication origins in eukaryotes might be recognized in a DNA-sequence-specific manner analogously to those in prokaryotes. In budding yeast, the search for genetic replicators lead to the identification of autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) that support efficient DNA replication initiation of extrachromosomal DNA. These ARS regions are approximately 100-200 bp long and exhibit a multipartite organization, containing A, B1, B2, and sometimes B3 elements that together are essential for origin function. The A element encompasses the conserved 11 bp ARS consensus sequence (ACS), which, in conjunction with the B1 element, constitutes the primary binding site for the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC), the eukaryotic replication initiator. Within ORC, five subunits are predicated on conserved AAA+ ATPase and winged-helix folds and co-assemble into a pentameric ring that encircles DNA. In budding yeast ORC, DNA binding elements in the ATPase and winged-helix domains, as well as adjacent basic patch regions in some of the ORC subunits, are positioned in the central pore of the ORC ring such that they aid the DNA-sequence-specific recognition of the ACS in an ATP-dependent manner. By contrast, the roles of the B2 and B3 elements are less clear. The B2 region is similar to the ACS in sequence and has been suggested to function as a second ORC binding site under certain conditions, or as a binding site for the replicative helicase core. Conversely, the B3 element recruits the transcription factor Abf1, albeit B3 is not found at all budding yeast origins and Abf1 binding does not appear to be strictly essential for origin function.

Origin recognition in eukaryotes other than &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; or its close relatives does not conform to the sequence-specific read-out of conserved origin DNA elements. Pursuits to isolate specific chromosomal replicator sequences more generally in eukaryotic species, either genetically or by genome-wide mapping of initiator binding or replication start sites, have failed to identify clear consensus sequences at origins. Thus, sequence-specific DNA-initiator interactions in budding yeast signify a specialized mode for origin recognition in this system rather than an archetypal mode for origin specification across the eukaryotic domain. Nonetheless, DNA replication does initiate at discrete sites that are not randomly distributed across eukaryotic genomes, arguing that alternative means determine the chromosomal location of origins in these systems. These mechanisms involve a complex interplay between DNA accessibility, nucleotide sequence skew (both AT-richness and CpG islands have been linked to origins), Nucleosome positioning, epigenetic features, DNA topology and certain DNA structural features (e.g., G4 motifs), as well as regulatory proteins and transcriptional interference. Importantly, origin properties vary not only between different origins in an organism and among species, but some can also change during development and cell differentiation. The chorion locus in &quot;Drosophila&quot; follicle cells constitutes a well-established example for spatial and developmental control of initiation events. This region undergoes DNA-replication-dependent gene amplification at a defined stage during oogenesis and relies on the timely and specific activation of chorion origins, which in turn is regulated by origin-specific cis-elements and several protein factors, including the Myb complex, E2F1, and E2F2. This combinatorial specification and multifactorial regulation of metazoan origins has complicated the identification of unifying features that determine the location of replication start sites across eukaryotes more generally.

To facilitate replication initiation and origin recognition, ORC assemblies from various species have evolved specialized auxiliary domains that are thought to aid initiator targeting to chromosomal origins or chromosomes in general. For example, the Orc4 subunit in &quot;S. pombe&quot; ORC contains several AT-hooks that preferentially bind AT-rich DNA, while in metazoan (animal) ORC the TFIIB-like domain of Orc6 is thought to perform a similar function. Metazoan Orc1 proteins also harbor a bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain that interacts with H4K20me2-nucleosomes. Particularly in mammalian cells, H4K20 methylation has been reported to be required for efficient replication initiation, and the Orc1&#x27;s BAH domain facilitates ORC association with chromosomes and Epstein-Barr virus origin-dependent replication. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that both observations are mechanistically linked at least in a subset of metazoa, but this possibility needs to be further explored in future studies. In addition to the recognition of certain DNA or epigenetic features, ORC also associates directly or indirectly with several partner proteins that could aid initiator recruitment, including LRWD1, PHIP (or DCAF14), HMGA1a, among others. Interestingly, &quot;Drosophila&quot; ORC, like its budding yeast counterpart, bends DNA and negative supercoiling has been reported to enhance DNA binding of this complex, suggesting that DNA shape and malleability might influence the location of ORC binding sites across metazoan genomes. A molecular understanding for how ORC&#x27;s DNA binding regions might support the read out of structural properties of the DNA duplex in metazoans rather than of specific DNA sequences as in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; awaits high-resolution structural information of DNA-bound metazoan initiator assemblies. Likewise, whether and how different epigenetic factors contribute to initiator recruitment in metazoan systems is poorly defined and is an important question that needs to be addressed in more detail.

Once recruited to origins, ORC and its co-factors Cdc6 and Cdt1 drive the deposition of the minichromosome maintenance 2-7 (Mcm2-7) complex onto DNA. Like the archaeal replicative helicase core, Mcm2-7 is loaded as a head-to-head double hexamer onto DNA to license origins. In S-phase, Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylate several Mcm2-7 subunits and additional initiation factors to promote the recruitment of the helicase co-activators Cdc45 and GINS, DNA melting, and ultimately bidirectional replisome assembly at a subset of the licensed origins. In both yeast and metazoans, origins are free or depleted of nucleosomes, a property that is crucial for Mcm2-7 loading, indicating that chromatin state at origins regulates not only initiator recruitment but also helicase loading. A permissive chromatin environment is further important for origin activation and has been implicated in regulating both origin efficiency and the timing of origin firing. Euchromatic origins typically contain active chromatin marks, replicate early, and are more efficient than late-replicating, heterochromatic origins, which conversely are characterized by repressive marks. Not surprisingly, several chromatin remodelers and chromatin-modifying enzymes have been found to associate with origins and certain initiation factors, but how their activities impact different replication initiation events remains largely obscure. Remarkably, cis-acting “early replication control elements” (ECREs) have recently also been identified to help regulate replication timing and to influence 3D genome architecture in mammalian cells. Understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that orchestrate this complex interplay between 3D genome organization, local and higher-order chromatin structure, and replication initiation is an exciting topic for further studies.

Why have metazoan replication origins diverged from the DNA sequence-specific recognition paradigm that determines replication start sites in prokaryotes and budding yeast? Observations that metazoan origins often co-localize with promoter regions in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and mammalian cells and that replication-transcription conflicts due to collisions of the underlying molecular machineries can lead to DNA damage suggest that proper coordination of transcription and replication is important for maintaining genome stability. Recent findings also point to a more direct role of transcription in influencing the location of origins, either by inhibiting Mcm2-7 loading or by repositioning of loaded Mcm2-7 on chromosomes. Sequence-independent (but not necessarily random) initiator binding to DNA additionally allows for flexibility in specifying helicase loading sites and, together with transcriptional interference and the variability in activation efficiencies of licensed origins, likely determines origin location and contributes to the co-regulation of DNA replication and transcriptional programs during development and cell fate transitions. Computational modeling of initiation events in &quot;S. pombe&quot;, as well as the identification of cell-type specific and developmentally-regulated origins in metazoans, are in agreement with this notion. However, a large degree of flexibility in origin choice also exists among different cells within a single population, albeit the molecular mechanisms that lead to the heterogeneity in origin usage remain ill-defined. Mapping origins in single cells in metazoan systems and correlating these initiation events with single-cell gene expression and chromatin status will be important to elucidate whether origin choice is purely stochastic or controlled in a defined manner.

== Viral==

Viruses often possess a single origin of replication.

A variety of proteins have been described as being involved in viral replication. For instance, Polyoma viruses utilize host cell DNA polymerases, which attach to a viral origin of replication if the T antigen is present.

== Variations ==
Although DNA replication is essential for genetic inheritance, defined, site-specific replication origins are technically not a requirement for genome duplication as long as all chromosomes are copied in their entirety to maintain gene copy numbers. Certain bacteriophages and viruses, for example, can initiate DNA replication by homologous recombination independent of dedicated origins. Likewise, the archaeon &quot;Haloferax volcanii&quot; uses recombination-dependent initiation to duplicate its genome when its endogenous origins are deleted. Similar non-canonical initiation events through break-induced or transcription-initiated replication have been reported in &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. Nonetheless, despite the ability of cells to sustain viability under these exceptional circumstances, origin-dependent initiation is a common strategy universally adopted across different domains of life.

In addition, detailed studies of replication initiation have focused on a limited number of model systems. The extensively studied fungi and metazoa are both members of the opisthokont supergroup and exemplify only a small fraction of the evolutionary landscape in the eukaryotic domain. Comparably few efforts have been directed at other eukaryotic model systems, such as kinetoplastids or tetrahymena. Surprisingly, these studies have revealed interesting differences both in origin properties and in initiator composition compared to yeast and metazoans.

<doc id="619138" wikidata="Q285493" url="?curid=619138" title="Estée Lauder (businesswoman)">
<text>Estée Lauder ( ; born Josephine Esther Mentzer; July 1, 1908 – April 24, 2004) was an American businesswoman. She co-founded her eponymous cosmetics company with her husband, Joseph Lauter (later Lauder). Lauder was the only woman on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1998 list of the 20 most influential business geniuses of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Lauder was born Josephine Esther Mentzer in Corona, Queens, New York City, the second child born to Rose Schotz and Max Mentzer. Her parents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants. Her maternal grandmother was from Sátoraljaújhely and her maternal grandfather was from (now Holice, Slovakia), while her father had Czech-Jewish ancestry. Lauder&#x27;s claims of descent from European aristocracy were discredited in a biography, &quot;Estée Lauder: Beyond the Magic&quot; (1985) by Lee Israel. Her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary observed &quot;she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all&quot;, notwithstanding &quot;the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry&quot;. Her &quot;favourite story was that she had been brought up by her Viennese mother in fashionable Flushing, Long Island, in a sumptuous home with stables, a chauffeured car and an Italian nurse.&quot;

In actuality, her mother Rose emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1898 with her five children at the time to join her first husband, Abraham Rosenthal. In 1905, Rose married Max Mentzer, a shopkeeper who had also immigrated to the United States in the 1890s. When their daughter was born, they wanted to name her , the diminutive form of the Hungarian first name Eszter, after her mother&#x27;s favorite Hungarian aunt, but decided at the last minute to keep the name &quot;Josephine&quot;, which they had agreed upon. However, the baby&#x27;s nickname became &quot;Estee&quot;, the name she would grow up using and responding to. Eventually, when she launched her perfume empire with her husband, she added an accent mark to make her name look French and began pronouncing it the way her father had in his Hungarian accent.

Lauder spent much of her childhood trying to make ends meet. Like most of her eight siblings, she worked at the family&#x27;s hardware store, where she got her first taste of business, entrepreneurship, and what it takes to be a successful retailer. Her childhood dream was to become an actress with her &quot;name in lights, flowers and handsome men&quot;.

When Lauder grew older, she agreed to help her uncle, Dr. John Schotz, with his business. Schotz was a chemist, and his company, New Way Laboratories, sold beauty products such as creams, lotions, rouge, and fragrances. She became more interested in his business than her father&#x27;s. She was fascinated watching her uncle create his products. He also taught her how to wash her face and do facial massages. After graduating from Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens, New York, she focused on her uncle&#x27;s business.

==Career==
Lauder named one of her uncle&#x27;s blends Super Rich All-Purpose Cream, and began selling the preparation to her friends. She sold creams like Six-In-One cold cream and Dr. Schotz&#x27;s Viennese Cream to beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts. One day, as she was getting her hair done at the House of Ash Blondes, the salon&#x27;s owner Florence Morris asked Lauder about her perfect skin. Soon, Estée returned to the beauty parlor to hand out four of her uncle&#x27;s creams and demonstrate their use. Morris was so impressed that she asked Lauder to sell her products at Morris&#x27;s new salon.

In 1953, Lauder introduced her first fragrance, Youth-Dew, a bath oil that doubled as a perfume. Instead of using French perfumes by the drop behind each ear, women began using Youth-Dew by the bottle in their bath water. In the first year, it sold 50,000 bottles; by 1984, the figure had risen to 150 million.

Lauder was the subject of a 1985 TV documentary, &quot;Estée Lauder: The Sweet Smell of Success&quot;. Explaining her success, she said, &quot;I have never worked a day in my life without selling. If I believe in something, I sell it, and I sell it hard.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Lauder received the Chevalier (Knight) class of the Legion of Honour from the Consul General of France, Gerard Causer, on January 16, 1978. She was the first woman to receive this honor. 

She was inducted to the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1988. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004.

==Personal life==
Estée met Joseph Lauter when she was in her early twenties. On January 15, 1930, they married. Their surname was later changed from Lauter to Lauder. Their first child, Leonard, was born March 19, 1933. The couple separated then divorced in 1939 and she moved to Florida, but they remarried in 1942. Their second son, Ronald, was born in 1944. Estée and Joseph Lauder remained married until his death in 1983, and she later regretted her divorce, saying that she married young and assumed that she had missed out on life but soon found out that she had the &quot;sweetest husband in the world&quot;.

Leonard became the chief executive of Estée Lauder and then chairman of the board. Ronald was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration and was U.S. Ambassador to Austria in 1986–87. As of 2021, he is the president of the World Jewish Congress.

==Death==
Lauder died of cardiopulmonary arrest on April 24, 2004, aged 95, at her home in Manhattan.

<doc id="619178" wikidata="Q3685229" url="?curid=619178" title="Pre-replication complex">
<text>A pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is a protein complex that forms at the origin of replication during the initiation step of DNA replication. Formation of the pre-RC is required for DNA replication to occur. Complete and faithful replication of the genome ensures that each daughter cell will carry the same genetic information as the parent cell. Accordingly, formation of the pre-RC is a very important part of the cell cycle.

==Components==
As organisms evolved and became increasingly more complex, so did their pre-RCs. The following is a summary of the components of the pre-RC amongst the different domains of life. 

In bacteria, the main component of the pre-RC is DnaA. The pre-RC is complete when DnaA occupies all of its binding sites within the bacterial origin of replication (oriC). The particular sites on the oriC that DnaA binds to determines if the cell has a bORC (bacterial Origin Recognition Complex) or a pre-RC.

The archaeal pre-RC is very different from the bacterial pre-RC and can serve as a simplified model of the eukaryotic pre-RC. It is composed of a single origin recognition complex (ORC) protein, Cdc6/ORC1, and a homohexamer of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein. &quot;Sulfolobus islandicus&quot; also uses a Cdt1 homologue to recognize one of its replication origins. 

The eukaryotic pre-RC is the most complex and highly regulated pre-RC. In most eukaryotes it is composed of six ORC proteins (ORC1-6), Cdc6, Cdt1, and a heterohexamer of the six MCM proteins (MCM2-7). The MCM heterohexamer arguably arose via MCM gene duplication events and subsequent divergent evolution. The pre-RC of &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; (&quot;S. pombe&quot;) is notably different from that of other eukaryotes; Cdc6 is replaced by the homologous Cdc18 protein. Sap1 is also included in the &quot;S. pombe&quot; pre-RC because it is required for Cdc18 binding. The pre-RC of &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; (&quot;X. laevis&quot;) also has an additional protein, MCM9, which helps load the MCM heterohexamer onto the origin of replication. The structure of the ORC, MCM, as well as the intermediate ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex has been resolved.

==Recognition of the origin of replication==
Recognition of the origin of replication is a critical first step in the formation of the pre-RC. In different domains of life this process is accomplished differently.

In prokaryotes, origin recognition is accomplished by DnaA. DnaA binds tightly to a 9-base pair consensus sequence in oriC; 5&#x27; – TTATCCACA – 3&#x27;. There are 5 such 9-bp sequences (R1-R5) and 4 non-consensus sequences (I1-I4) within oriC that DnaA binds with differential affinity. DnaA binds R4, R1, and R2 with high affinity and R5, I1, I2, I3, and R3 with lesser affinity. &quot;In vivo,&quot; it has been observed that the DnaA binding to recognition sites occurs in the order: R1, R2, then R4, which forms the bORC. Afterwards, the other lower affinity, 9 bp recognition sites bind to DnaA, which forms the pre-RC.

Archaea have 1–3 origins of replication. The origins are generally AT-rich tracts that vary based on the archaeal species. The singular archaeal ORC protein recognizes the AT-rich tracts and binds DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion.

Eukaryotes typically have multiple origins of replication; at least one per chromosome. &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (&quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;) is the only known eukaryote with a defined initiation sequence TTTTTATG/ATTTA/T. This initiation sequence is recognized by ORC1-5. ORC6 is not known to bind DNA in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. Initiation sequences in &quot;S. pombe&quot; and higher eukaryotes are not well defined. However, the initiation sequences are generally either AT-rich or exhibit bent or curved DNA topology. The ORC4 protein is known to bind the AT-rich portion of the origin of replication in &quot;S. pombe&quot; using AT hook motifs. The mechanism of origin recognition in higher eukaryotes is not well understood but it is thought that the ORC1-6 proteins depend on unusual DNA topology for binding.

==Loading==
Assembly of the pre-replication complex only occurs during late M phase and early G1 phase of the cell cycle when cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is low. This timing and other regulatory mechanisms ensure that DNA replication will only occur once per cell cycle. Assembly of the pre-RC relies on prior origin recognition, either by DnaA in prokaryotes or by ORC in archaea and eukaryotes. 

The pre-RC of prokaryotes is complete when DnaA occupies all possible binding sites within the oriC. DnaA can only bind to the low affinity sites on the oriC once the protein fis is removed from the oriC. Removal of fis, the protein IHF (integrated host factor) binds to a site between R1 and R2, which allows DnaA to bind to the low affinity sites on the oriC. This completes the pre-RC.

The pre-RC of archaea requires ORC binding of the origin. After this, Cdc6 and the MCM homohexameric complex bind in a sequential fashion. 

Eukaryotes have the most complex pre-RC. After ORC1-6 bind the origin of replication, Cdc6 is recruited. Cdc6 recruits the licensing factor Cdt1 and MCM2-7. Cdt1 binding and ATP hydrolysis by the ORC and Cdc6 load MCM2-7 onto DNA. There is a stoichiometric excess of the MCM proteins over the ORC and Cdc6 proteins, indicating that there may be multiple MCM heterohexamers bound to each origin of replication.

==Initiation of replication==
After the pre-RC is formed it must be activated and the replisome assembled in order for DNA replication to occur. 

In prokaryotes, DnaA hydrolyzes ATP in order to unwind DNA at the oriC. This denatured region is accessible to the DnaB helicase and DnaC helicase loader. Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the newly formed replication bubble and interact with the DnaG primase. DnaG recruits the replicative DNA polymerase III, and replication begins.

In eukaryotes, MCM heterohexamer is phosphorylated by CDC7 and CDK, which displaces Cdc6 and recruits MCM10. MCM10 cooperates with MCM2-7 in the recruitment of Cdc45. Cdc45 then recruits key components of the replisome; the replicative DNA polymerase α and its primase. DNA replication can then begin.

==Prevention of pre-replication complex re-assembly==
During each cell cycle, it is important that the genome be completely replicated once and only once. Formation of the pre-replication complex during late M and early G1 phase is required for genome replication, but after the genome has been replicated the pre-RC must not form again until the next cell cycle. 

In prokaryotes, various studies have demonstrated that the pre-RC is a complex that is only present for a fraction of the cell cycle. Once a cellular division occurs, the pre-RC must revert back to the bORC to ensure that only one round of DNA replication occurs during division. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, there are 11 GATC sites in the oriC that undergo hemimethylation during DNA replication. The protein SeqA binds to these sites preventing remethylation and blocking the binding of DnaA to low affinity sites for approximately one third of the cell cycle. However, SeqA does not block DnaA from binding to the R1, R2, and R4 sites. Thus, the bORC is reset and is prepared to undergo another conversion to the pre-RC.

In S. cerevisiae, CDKs prevent formation of the replication complex during late G1, S, and G2 phases by excluding MCM2-7 and Cdt1 from the nucleus, targeting Cdc6 for degradation by the proteasome, and dissociating ORC1-6 from chromatin via phosphorylation. Prevention of re-replication in S. pombe is slightly different; Cdt1 is degraded by the proteasome instead of merely being excluded from the nucleus. Proteolytic regulation of Cdt1 is shared by higher eukaryotes including &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;X. laevis&quot;, and mammals. Metazoans have a fourth mechanism to prevent re-replication; during S and G2 geminin binds to Cdt1 and inhibits Cdt1 from loading MCM2-7 onto the origin of replication.

==Meier-Gorlin syndrome==
Defects in components of the eukaryotic replication complex are known to cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome, which is characterized by dwarfism, absent or hypoplastic patellae, small ears, impaired pre- and post-natal growth, and microcephaly. Known mutations are in the ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6 genes. The disease phenotype probably originates from reduced ability of cells to proliferate, leading to cell number, and general growth failure.

<text>Robert Patrick Casey (January 9, 1932 – May 30, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician from Pennsylvania who served as the 42nd governor of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1995. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 22nd district from 1963 to 1968 and as Auditor General of Pennsylvania from 1969 to 1977.

Casey was best known for leading the anti-abortion wing of the Democratic Party, spearheading the opposition against &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, a landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion. He championed unions, believed in government as a beneficent force, and supported gun rights.

His son, Bob Casey Jr., also served as Auditor General of Pennsylvania and went on to serve as Pennsylvania Treasurer and as Pennsylvania&#x27;s U.S. Senator.

==Early life and education==
Casey was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, the son of Alphonsus Liguori and Marie (née Cummings) Casey. His family, of Irish descent, was originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, but his parents moved to New York in order for his father, a devoutly Roman Catholic former coal miner who began working as a coal miner at age 10, to attend Fordham University School of Law. The family returned to Scranton following Casey&#x27;s birth.

After attending Scranton Preparatory School, Casey turned down an offer to play for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1949, opting to go to college instead. He went to the College of the Holy Cross, where he was president of his senior class, on a basketball scholarship. He played on the same team as future NBA hall of famer Bob Cousy. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953, and received his Juris Doctor from George Washington University in 1956. Upon graduation and admission to the bar, Casey worked for the Washington, D.C., law firm Covington &amp; Burling, where he remained until returning to Scranton in 1958 to enter solo practice.

==Political career==
===State Senate===
Casey served as a Democratic Party member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 22nd district from 1963 to 1968. He first sought the office of Governor of Pennsylvania in 1966, losing the Democratic Party primary to Milton Shapp. Casey was the candidate of the party establishment, but the independently wealthy Shapp ran a successful insurgent campaign for the nomination. Casey tried on two other occasions without success, in 1970 (again losing to Shapp) and again in 1978 (losing to Pete Flaherty). Considered a moderate and despite growing frustration with Democratic Party policies, Casey rejected Republican offers to run for governor on their ticket on two occasions.

=== Auditor General ===
In 1968 and 1972 Casey was elected to the post of Auditor General of Pennsylvania. Paul Beers in his 1980 book &quot;Pennsylvania Politics Today and Yesterday: The Tolerable Accommodation&quot;, wrote that Casey was &quot;regarded as the finest auditor general the Commonwealth ever had.&quot; During his term as Auditor General, Casey was noted for feuding with then-Governor Shapp over Pennsylvania&#x27;s pension system and exposing corruption. Before Casey, the Auditor General&#x27;s office had no public accountants, who hired 24 of them. Beers notes that during his two terms, &quot;Contracts for day care, Medicare, the Farm Show, highways, [Milton] Shapp&#x27;s pet dream of a Pocono Arts Center, and property leases were all investigated and audited thoroughly by Casey, with accompanying headlines when he uncovered mistakes or petty corruptions.&quot;

===Third gubernatorial run and mistaken identity===
Restricted from seeking another term as Auditor General of Pennsylvania, Casey declined to seek the office of Pennsylvania Treasurer in 1976. Instead, a Cambria County recorder of deeds named Robert E. Casey won the Democratic primary and the general election, spending virtually no money and doing virtually no campaigning; voters merely assumed they were voting for the outgoing Auditor General.

In 1978, another candidate named Robert P. Casey, this one a teacher and ice cream parlor owner from Monroeville, Pennsylvania, received the Democratic party&#x27;s nomination for lieutenant governor, again with a no-spending, no-campaigning strategy. This Casey, who joined Democratic gubernatorial nominee Pete Flaherty, narrowly lost to Richard Thornburgh and William Scranton III.

There was also a Robert J. Casey who sought a congressional seat in Western Pennsylvania and a Dennis Casey who ran for Pennsylvania State Senate.

In 1980 the Republicans launched an extensive advertising campaign to clarify that &quot;Casey isn&#x27;t Casey,&quot; and the Democratic state treasurer was defeated for re-election, losing to R. Budd Dwyer.

===Fourth gubernatorial run and election===

After a decade practicing law, Casey made a fourth bid for governor in 1986, billing himself as the &quot;real Bob Casey&quot; to distinguish himself and make light of the mistaken identity follies of the past. Dubbed &quot;the three-time loss from Holy Cross&quot; by detractors, Casey hired two then generally unknown political strategists, James Carville and Paul Begala, to lead his campaign staff.

Unlike his three previous tries, Casey won the Democratic primary, defeating Philadelphia district attorney (and future Philadelphia Mayor and two term governor) Ed Rendell. He then faced Thornburgh&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Bill Scranton in the general election. The race was considered too close to call until three weeks before the election, when a poster appeared statewide, depicting Scranton as a &quot;dope smoking hippie&quot;. Casey condemned this poster in the Pittsburgh Press on October 18, 1986. On the Saturday before election day, however, Carville launched the now infamous &quot;guru ad&quot;, a TV advert which attacked Scranton&#x27;s practice of transcendental meditation. Casey defeated Scranton by a margin of 79,000 votes.

==Governor==

Inaugurated on January 20, 1987, Casey was immediately confronted with several serious issues. Budd Dwyer, the state treasurer who had been convicted on charges of accepting kickbacks, committed suicide at a televised press conference just two days into his term. Casey brought what he called an &quot;activist government&quot; to Pennsylvania, expanding health care services for women, introducing reforms to the state&#x27;s welfare system, and introducing an insurance program for uninsured children (which became a model for the successful SCHIP program later adopted nationwide). House Bill 20, entitled the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Act, created the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in Pennsylvania. According to PA&#x27;s CHIP website, &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s CHIP program would later be used as the model for the federal government&#x27;s SCHIP program. Legislation for the federal CHIP program was signed into law August 5, 1997, by former president Bill Clinton.&quot;

Casey also introduced a &quot;capital for a day&quot; program, where the state&#x27;s official business was conducted from eighteen different communities throughout the state. Despite charges that his administration squandered a budget surplus and ran the state into record annual budget deficits, Casey remained popular with voters, easily winning re-election in 1990 against abortion-rights Republican nominee Barbara Hafer. Polling data showed that abortion attitudes were a stronger predictor of vote choice than party affiliation.

===Abortion===
Governor Casey was well known as a staunch Roman Catholic anti-abortion advocate.

In 1989, Casey pushed through the legislature the &quot;Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act&quot;, which placed limitations on abortion, including the notification of parents of minors, a twenty-four-hour waiting period, and a ban on partial-birth procedures except in cases of risk to the life of the mother. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania sued, with Casey as the named defendant, asserting that the law violated &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

The case went to the United States Supreme Court in April 1992. On June 29, 1992, in the case of &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld all of Pennsylvania&#x27;s restrictions except one (the requirement for spousal notification) allowing states to impose certain restrictions, but still affirming the right to an abortion found in &quot;Roe&quot;.

====1992 Democratic National Convention controversy====
Considering abortion a key social issue for the 1992 presidential election, Casey tried to get a speaking slot to give a minority plank on the topic at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. He was not given a speaking slot and said in a series of news conferences the party was censoring his anti-abortion views even though he agreed with the party on nearly all other issues. And after a speech by another abortion-rights supporter from Pennsylvania, DNC supporters actually sent a camera crew in search of Casey to humiliate him.

After the convention, convention organizers tried to say that Casey was not allowed to speak because he did not support the Democratic ticket. Al Gore called Casey the next day to apologize.

Casey in his memoir incorrectly claimed that, convention speaker Kathleen Brown had not endorsed the ticket due to bitterness over her brother Jerry Brown&#x27;s losing the nomination. Despite holding out for a while, and even vowing to promote his own party platform even a few days prior to the start of the convention, Brown had come to quietly support the Clinton ticket as the convention got underway.

Several anti-abortion Democrats such as John Breaux addressed the convention, though did not speak directly on the issue of abortion. After the convention, Casey went on vacation rather than campaign for Clinton in Pennsylvania, which was a key swing state. He also refused to say whether he would campaign for the Democratic nominee, though he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I support the ticket. Period.&quot; Several anti-abortion Democrats spoke at the convention, but they did not focus their remarks on abortion, and the issue was not debated the way that Casey had wanted.

===Death penalty===
Regarding capital punishment, Governor Casey&#x27;s administration came under much criticism. In an interview with C-Span in 1992, Governor Casey stated: &quot;I support the death penalty.&quot; However, Casey was criticized as being &quot;wishy-washy&quot; on the death penalty. Governor Casey during his term signed 21 execution warrants, but none of those were carried out, and upon entering office in 1987, dissolved a death warrant signed by his predecessor Dick Thornburgh, five days before it was stated to occur.

For a period of four years during his administration from May 1991 on, Casey refused to sign any death penalty warrants. In 1994, Casey vetoed a bill that would &quot;require Casey and future governors to sign death warrants for condemned killers within 60 days after their death sentences are upheld by the state Supreme Court.&quot;

Casey would be forced to sign two death warrants after May 1991, after a lawsuit was brought by Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli. The court ruled in &quot;Morganelli v. Casey&quot;, that Casey did not have the power to ignore death warrants. Pennsylvania resumed executions once Casey&#x27;s successor, Tom Ridge, took office.

On November 29, 1990, Governor Casey signed a bill that eliminated the electric chair as a method of executions in Pennsylvania and replaced it by lethal injection.

===U.S. Senate politics===
On April 4, 1991, Casey was faced with filling a vacancy in the U.S. Senate when Republican U.S. Senator John Heinz died in a plane crash. After briefly considering appointing Chrysler Corporation Chairman Lee Iacocca, an Allentown native, Casey settled on state Secretary of Labor and Industry, and former Kennedy functionary Harris Wofford (despite private fears that he was too liberal for rural Pennsylvania voters). According to former Casey press secretary Vince Carocci, the Governor insisted on two conditions:

With those assurances in hand, Governor Casey appointed Wofford to the Senate, and then vigorously supported him in Wofford&#x27;s uphill fight to remain in the Senate against former Pennsylvania Governor and U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in the special election held that fall. Thanks in large part to Casey&#x27;s fundraising prowess and Carville&#x27;s political ability, Senator Wofford scored an upset victory over Thornburgh. However, Casey and Wofford came into conflict during the early Clinton administration, when Wofford refused a personal plea by Casey to support an amendment similar to a provision in Casey&#x27;s Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act. Casey made it very clear that if Wofford opposed the amendment, the Governor would withhold his support in Wofford&#x27;s next Senate election. Wofford supported the amendment, but still was defeated in the 1994 election by two-term conservative Congressman Rick Santorum.

The footnote to this story came years after Governor Casey&#x27;s death. By 2005, the Governor&#x27;s son, Bob Casey Jr., had served two terms as auditor general and had been elected state treasurer the year before, crushing his opponent with over 3.3 million votes. Despite the younger Casey&#x27;s anti-abortion views, National Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, heavily recruited him to run in the 2006 election against Santorum, by now the number-three Republican in the Senate. Casey went on to win a landslide victory over Santorum.

===Health issues===
In October 1987, Casey suffered a heart attack and underwent quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery.

In 1991, during his second term, Casey was diagnosed with hereditary amyloidosis, an inherited condition characterized by the deposition of insoluble proteins in organs and tissues. Though rare, the disease had also claimed the lives of Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri and Erie Mayor Louis Tullio in 1988 and 1990, respectively. To combat the disease, he underwent an extremely rare heart-liver transplant on the morning of June 14, 1993, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Before undergoing the operation, he transferred executive authority to Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel, marking the first time Pennsylvania was under the leadership of an acting governor. Casey resumed his duties on December 13, 1993, almost six months to the day after he underwent the operation.

Following his operation, Casey strongly supported legislation that encouraged organ transplants by guaranteeing access to the families of potential organ donors by organ recovery organizations, providing drivers&#x27; license identification of potential donors, and establishing an organ donation trust fund from voluntary donations to promote the benefits of organ donation. The organ donation trust fund was named in his honor.

==Post-political career and death==
Prohibited from seeking a third term, Casey left office on January 17, 1995. He contemplated a run for president to oppose Bill Clinton in the 1996 Democratic primaries, even going as far as to file paper needed to raise money for a presidential campaign in March 1995. However, he declined due to failing health.

In 1996, Casey published an autobiography titled &quot;Fighting for Life&quot;.

Despite the transplants, Casey continued to suffer long-term effects of his disease and died of a viral infection on May 30, 2000, at age 68 in Mercy Hospital in Scranton. He is interred in Saint Catherine&#x27;s Cemetery in Moscow, Pennsylvania.

He and his wife of forty-seven years, Ellen (née Harding) had eight children, including Bob Jr. Ellen died on August 11, 2023, at age 91.

<text>Walter Cox McCrone Jr. (June 9, 1916 – July 10, 2002) was an American chemist who worked extensively on applications of polarized light microscopy and is sometimes characterized as the &quot;father of modern microscopy&quot;. He was also an expert in electron microscopy, crystallography, ultra-microanalysis, and particle identification. In 1960 he founded the McCrone Research Institute, a non-profit educational and research organization for microscopy based in Chicago.

McCrone&#x27;s crystallographic work on polymorphism and its pharmaceutical applications played a central role in the subsequent development of the field. To the general public, McCrone was best known for his work in forensic science, especially his analyses of the Vinland Map and the Shroud of Turin. In 2000, he received the American Chemical Society&#x27;s National Award in Analytical Chemistry.

==Biography==

Walter McCrone was born in Wilmington, Delaware, but he grew up mostly in New York State. His father was a civil engineer in charge of one of the first DuPont plants to manufacture cellophane. McCrone received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from Cornell University in 1938 and a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the same institution in 1942. From 1942 to 1944 he was a post-doctoral researcher at Cornell. In 1944, McCrone published a detailed study on &quot;The Microscopic Examination of High Explosives and Boosters&quot;.

In 1944, McCrone began to work as a microscopist and materials scientist at the Armour Research Foundation, now the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Research Institute. He was also a professor at IIT and served as assistant chairman of its Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Department. In 1948, McCrone and IIT electron microscopist Charles F. Tufts organized the first of the meetings that are now the International Microscopy Conference (Inter/Micro). Among the speakers at the first conference was Nobel laureate Frits Zernike.

In 1956, McCrone left IIT and founded an analytical consulting firm, McCrone Associates, which is now located in Westmont, Illinois. In 1960, he established the McCrone Research Institute, a nonprofit organization for teaching and research in microscopy and crystallography, based in Chicago. In 1979, he retired from McCrone Associates in order to dedicate himself to teaching full time. The proceeds from his work as a consulting chemist allowed McCrone to endow the Émile M. Chamot Professorship of Chemistry at Cornell, named in honor of McCrone&#x27;s university mentor. According to chemist and forensic scientist John A. Reffner, &quot;during McCrone&#x27;s life, he taught microscopy to more students than anyone else in history&quot;.

For more than thirty years McCrone edited and published &quot;The Microscope&quot;, an international quarterly journal of microscopy that had been established in 1937 by the British microscopist Arthur L. E. Barron. McCrone also wrote more than 400 technical articles along with sixteen books or chapters. He is credited with expanding the usefulness of the optical microscopy to chemists, who had previously regarded it as primarily a tool for biologists. One of his publications was the &quot;Particle Atlas&quot;, first published in 1967, which provided an exhaustive description of small particles and how to identify them with the aid of a microscope. That work became widely used in forensic laboratories. The &quot;Particle Atlas&quot;, which was written in collaboration with other staff members of McCrone Associates, appeared in a six-volume second edition in 1973. In 1992, it became available in CD-ROM.

Walter McCrone served on the board of directors and as president of the Ada S. McKinley Community Services, a nonprofit social services agency in Chicago. He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Chicago, at the age of 86. From 1957 until his death in 2002, he was married to Lucy B. McCrone, &quot;née&quot; Beman. The two had met while she was working as an analytical chemist for the management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After their marriage, Lucy McCrone worked as a chemical microanalyst for McCrone Associates in Chicago and was co-founder and director of the McCrone Research Institute until 1984.

==Polymorphism==

In the 1950s and 1960s, McCrone conducted extensive research on the microscopic characterization of polymorphs, which he defined as materials that are &quot;different in crystal structure but identical in the liquid or vapor states&quot;. He investigated the difference in the properties of polymorphs of medications, co-authoring with John Haleblian a review article on &quot;the pharmaceutical application of polymorphism&quot;, published in 1969. McCrone&#x27;s work on polymorphism exerted a strong influence upon the scientific career of Joel Bernstein.

==Vinland Map==

The Vinland Map appears to be a 15th-century &quot;mappa mundi&quot; showing a landmass in the Atlantic Ocean, directly south-west of Greenland, labelled &quot;Vinlanda Insula&quot; (&quot;Isle of Vinland&quot;). It first came to light in 1957 and was acquired by Yale University in 1964. The map&#x27;s authenticity would have demonstrated the awareness of European catographers of a part of the American continent, before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. McCrone, already reputed for his expertise in authenticating ancient documents and works of art, was asked by Yale to analyze the map in 1972. In 1974, he published evidence that the ink of the map contained synthetic anatase (a form of titanium dioxide), a substance not used as a pigment until the 1920s. McCrone detected the anatase in the yellow ink that the forger used to simulate the natural discoloration that appears over long periods of time around lines drawn on parchment in medieval iron gall ink.

McCrone&#x27;s work on the Vinland Map led to a protracted controversy, with other researchers continuing to argue for the document&#x27;s authenticity and discounting the presence of anatase as insignificant. In 2021, Raymond Clemens, the curator of early books and manuscripts at Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library where the map is housed, declared that it had been conclusively shown to be a fake. That judgment was largely based on the presence of synthetic anatase in the ink, as first identified by McCrone.

==Shroud of Turin==

As a result of McCrone&#x27;s work on the Vinland Map, British author and researcher Ian Wilson approached McCrone in 1974 about the possibility of scientifically analyzing the Shroud of Turin, a length of linen cloth that has been venerated for centuries as the burial shroud of Jesus upon which his image is miraculously imprinted. This led to McCrone&#x27;s involvement with the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). In 1977, a team of scientists affiliated with STURP proposed a barrage of tests to be carried out on the Shroud. With permission from the Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, STURP researchers conducted tests over a period of five days in October 1978, also using adhesive tape to obtain samples of the fibers from various parts on the Shroud&#x27;s surface.

Based on his microscopic and chemical analysis of the tape samples obtained by STURP, McCrone concluded that the image on the Shroud was painted with a dilute pigment of red ochre in a collagen tempera (i.e., gelatin) medium, using a technique similar to the grisaille employed in the 14th century by Simone Martini and other European artists. McCrone also found that the &quot;bloodstains&quot; in the image had been highlighted with vermilion (a bright red pigment made from mercury sulfide), also in a collagen tempera medium. McCrone reported that no actual blood was present in the samples taken from the Shroud.

McCrone&#x27;s results were rejected by other members of STURP and McCrone resigned from STURP in June 1980. Two other members of STURP, John Heller and Alan Adler, published their own analysis concluding that Shroud did show traces of blood. Other STURP members also disputed McCrone&#x27;s conclusion that the Shroud image was painted, finding that physical analyses excluded the presence of pigments in sufficient quantities to account for the visible image.

McCrone continued to defend his results and to insist that polarized light microscopy, in which he was the only expert among the original members of STURP, was the correct technique to apply to the study of the Shroud. In 1983, he confidently predicted that radiocarbon dating of the Shroud&#x27;s linen would show that it had been made shortly before the first historically recorded exhibition of the Shroud in 1356. The results of the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud vindicated McCrone&#x27;s microscopic and chemical analyses.

McCrone re-stated and summarized his evidence that the Shroud was painted in an article published in 1990 in the journal &quot;Accounts of Chemical Research&quot;. He later wrote a book on the subject, &quot;Judgment Day for the Shroud of Turin&quot;, published in 1996 by the McCrone Research Institute&#x27;s Microscope Publications and re-issued in 1999 by Prometheus Books. In 2000, the American Chemical Society presented McCrone with its National Award in Analytical Chemistry for his work on the Shroud and for &quot;his enduring patience for the defense of his methodologies&quot;.

==Other investigations==

McCrone&#x27;s work as a microscopist first attracted widespread public attention when he helped exonerate Lloyd Eldon Miller, a cabdriver who had been sentenced to death for the 1955 murder of an 8-year-old girl in Canton, Illinois. McCrone was able to show that the stains in a pair of undershorts that the prosecution had presented to the jury as blood were actually red paint. Miller&#x27;s conviction was overturned by the US Supreme Court in 1967. In later life, McCrone microscopically examined the physical evidence (hairs, fibers, blood, etc.) that led to the conviction of Wayne Williams as the Atlanta child killer. That work earned him the 1982 Certificate of Merit from the Forensic Sciences Foundation.

On occasion, McCrone was given hair samples of famous people to analyze. Based on such analysis, he rejected the hypothesis that Napoleon had been poisoned with arsenic, but concluded that Beethoven had suffered from lead poisoning.

==Posthumous recognition==

The executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) voted in April 2011 to include Walter McCrone in its &quot;Pantheon of Skeptics&quot;. The Pantheon of Skeptics commemorates deceased distinguished fellows of CSI and their exceptional contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

<text>Cyclins are proteins that control the progression of a cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK).

== Etymology ==

Cyclins were originally discovered by R. Timothy Hunt in 1982 while studying the cell cycle of sea urchins.

In an interview hosted by Jim Al-Khalili and R. Timothy Hunt for &quot;The Life Scientific&quot;, which aired on December 13, 2011, explained that the name &quot;cyclin&quot; was originally named after his hobby cycling. It was only after the naming did its importance in the cell cycle become apparent. As it was appropriate, the name stuck.

R. Timothy Hunt: &quot;By the way, the name cyclin, which I coined, was really a joke, it&#x27;s because I liked cycling so much at the time, but they did come and go in the cell...&quot;

== Function ==
Cyclins were originally named because their concentration varies in a cyclical fashion during the cell cycle. (Note that the cyclins are now classified according to their conserved cyclin box structure, and not all these cyclins alter in level through the cell cycle.) The oscillations of the cyclins, namely fluctuations in cyclin gene expression and destruction by the ubiquitin mediated proteasome pathway, induce oscillations in Cdk activity to drive the cell cycle. A cyclin forms a complex with Cdk, which begins to activate, but the complete activation requires phosphorylation as well. Complex formation results in activation of the Cdk active site. Cyclins themselves have no enzymatic activity but have binding sites for some substrates and target the Cdks to specific subcellular locations.

Cyclins, when bound with the dependent kinases, such as the p34/cdc2/cdk1 protein, form the maturation-promoting factor. MPFs activate other proteins through phosphorylation. These phosphorylated proteins, in turn, are responsible for specific events during cell division such as microtubule formation and chromatin remodeling. Cyclins can be divided into four classes based on their behaviour in the cell cycle of vertebrate somatic cells and yeast cells: G1 cyclins, G1/S cyclins, S cyclins, and M cyclins. This division is useful when talking about most cell cycles, but it is not universal as some cyclins have different functions or timing in different cell types.

G1/S Cyclins rise in late G1 and fall in early S phase. The Cdk- G1/S cyclin complex begins to induce the initial processes of DNA replication, primarily by arresting systems that prevent S phase Cdk activity in G1. The cyclins also promote other activities to progress the cell cycle, such as centrosome duplication in vertebrates or spindle pole body in yeast. The rise in presence of G1/S cyclins is paralleled by a rise in S cyclins.

G1 cyclins do not behave like the other cyclins, in that the concentrations increase gradually (with no oscillation), throughout the cell cycle based on cell growth and the external growth-regulatory signals. The presence of G cyclins coordinate cell growth with the entry to a new cell cycle.

S cyclins bind to Cdk and the complex directly induces DNA replication. The levels of S cyclins remain high, not only throughout S phase, but through G2 and early mitosis as well to promote early events in mitosis.

M cyclin concentrations rise as the cell begins to enter mitosis and the concentrations peak at metaphase. Cell changes in the cell cycle like the assembly of mitotic spindles and alignment of sister-chromatids along the spindles are induced by M cyclin- Cdk complexes. The destruction of M cyclins during metaphase and anaphase, after the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint is satisfied, causes the exit of mitosis and cytokinesis.
Expression of cyclins detected immunocytochemically in individual cells in relation to cellular DNA content (cell cycle phase), or in relation to initiation and termination of DNA replication during S-phase, can be measured by flow cytometry.

Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a D-type cyclin (ORF72) that binds CDK6 and is likely to contribute to KSHV-related cancers.

== Domain structure ==

Cyclins are generally very different from each other in primary structure, or amino acid sequence. However, all members of the cyclin family are similar in 100 amino acids that make up the cyclin box. Cyclins contain two domains of a similar all-α fold, the first located at the N-terminus and the second at the C-terminus. All cyclins are believed to contain a similar tertiary structure of two compact domains of 5 α helices. The first of which is the conserved cyclin box, outside of which cyclins are divergent. For example, the amino-terminal regions of S and M cyclins contain short destruction-box motifs that target these proteins for proteolysis in mitosis.

== Types ==

There are several different cyclins that are active in different parts of the cell cycle and that cause the Cdk to phosphorylate different substrates. There are also several &quot;orphan&quot; cyclins for which no Cdk partner has been identified. For example, cyclin F is an orphan cyclin that is essential for G2/M transition. A study in &quot;C. elegans&quot; revealed the specific roles of mitotic cyclins. Notably, recent studies have shown that cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation. Cells must separate their chromosomes precisely, an event that relies on the bi-oriented attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules through specialized structures called kinetochores. In the early phases of division, there are numerous errors in how kinetochores bind to spindle microtubules. The unstable attachments promote the correction of errors by causing a constant detachment, realignment and reattachment of microtubules from kinetochores in the cells as they try to find the correct attachment. Protein cyclin A governs this process by keeping the process going until the errors are eliminated. In normal cells, persistent cyclin A expression prevents the stabilization of microtubules bound to kinetochores even in cells with aligned chromosomes. As levels of cyclin A decline, microtubule attachments become stable, allowing the chromosomes to be divided correctly as cell division proceeds. In contrast, in cyclin A-deficient cells, microtubule attachments are prematurely stabilized. Consequently, these cells may fail to correct errors, leading to higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation.

=== Main groups ===

There are two main groups of cyclins:

* G1/S cyclins – essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S transition,
** Cyclin A / CDK2 – active in S phase.
** Cyclin D / CDK4, Cyclin D / CDK6, and Cyclin E / CDK2 – regulates transition from G1 to S phase.
* G2/M cyclins – essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M transition (mitosis). G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase).
** Cyclin B / CDK1 – regulates progression from G2 to M phase.

=== Subtypes ===

The specific cyclin subtypes along with their corresponding CDK (in brackets) are:

<text>The River Nith (; Common Brittonic: &quot;Nowios&quot;) is a river in south-west Scotland. The Nith rises in the Carsphairn hills of East Ayrshire, between Prickeny Hill and Enoch Hill, east of Dalmellington. For the majority of its course it flows in a south-easterly direction through Dumfries and Galloway and then into the Solway Firth at Airds Point.

The territory through which the river flows is called Nithsdale (historically known as &quot;Stranit&quot; from , &quot;valley of the Nith&quot;).

==Length==

For estuaries the principle followed is that the river should be visible at all times. The measurement therefore follows the centre of the river at low tide and the mouth of the river is assumed to be at the coastal high tide mark. In Scotland this does not generally make a significant difference, except for rivers draining into shallow sloping sands of the Irish Sea and Solway Firth, notably the Nith. At low tide, the sea recedes to such an extent that the length of the Nith is extended by 13 km to 113.8 km (70.7 miles), making it Scotland&#x27;s seventh longest river.

==Protected areas==
The estuary of the River Nith is an internationally important winter feeding site for waders, geese and other wildfowl, and is for this reason protected at an international level as part of the Upper Solway Flats and Marshes Ramsar site and Special Protection Area. The SPA supports virtually the entire Svalbard population of barnacle geese during winter.

The area also forms part of the Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation, which is protected due to the presence of several priority habitats, and as well as populations of sea lamprey and river lamprey. At a national level, the area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is within the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve.

The Nith Estuary National Scenic Area recognises the scenic value of the area. It is one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development by restricting certain forms of development. The Nith Estuary NSA covers 14,337 ha in total, consisting of 14,310 ha of land and intertidal sand and mudflats, as well as a further 28 ha that is below low water. Management of the NSA is the responsibility of Dumfries and Galloway Council, who have produced a management strategy for the area.

<doc id="619200" wikidata="Q46292" url="?curid=619200" title="Cyclin-dependent kinase">
<text>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a predominant group of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and its progression, ensuring the integrity and functionality of cellular machinery. These regulatory enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle and transcription, as well as DNA repair, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation, in response to several extracellular and intracellular signals. They are present in all known eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. The catalytic activities of CDKs are regulated by interactions with CDK inhibitors (CKIs) and regulatory subunits known as cyclins. Cyclins have no enzymatic activity themselves, but they become active once they bind to CDKs. Without cyclin, CDK is less active than in the cyclin-CDK heterodimer complex. CDKs phosphorylate proteins on serine (S) or threonine (T) residues. The specificity of CDKs for their substrates is defined by the S/T-P-X-K/R sequence, where S/T is the phosphorylation site, P is proline, X is any amino acid, and the sequence ends with lysine (K) or arginine (R). This motif ensures CDKs accurately target and modify proteins, crucial for regulating cell cycle and other functions. Deregulation of the CDK activity is linked to various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and stroke.

== Evolutionary history ==
CDKs were initially identified through studies in model organisms such as yeasts and frogs, underscoring their pivotal role in cell cycle progression. These enzymes operate by forming complexes with cyclins, whose levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle, thereby ensuring timely cell cycle transitions. Over the years, the understanding of CDKs has expanded beyond cell division to include roles in gene transcription integration of cellular signals.

The evolutionary journey of CDKs has led to a diverse family with specific members dedicated to cell cycle phases or transcriptional control. For instance, budding yeast expresses six distinct CDKs, with some binding multiple cyclins for cell cycle control and others binding with a single cyclin for transcription regulation. In humans, the expansion to 20 CDKs and 29 cyclins illustrates their complex regulatory roles. Key CDKs such as CDK1 are indispensable for cell cycle control, while others like CDK2 and CDK3 are not. Moreover, transcriptional CDKs, such as CDK7 in humans, play crucial roles in initiating transcription by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), indicating the intricate link between cell cycle regulation and transcriptional management. This evolutionary expansion from simple regulators to multifunctional enzymes underscores the critical importance of CDKs in the complex regulatory networks of eukaryotic cells.
=== Notable people ===
In 2001, the scientists Leland H. Hartwell, Tim Hunt and Sir Paul M. Nurse were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of key regulators of the cell cycle.

* Leland H. Hartwell (b. 1939): Through studies of yeast in 1971, Heartwell identified crucial genes for cell division, outlining the cell cycle&#x27;s stages and essential checkpoints to prevent cancerous cell division.
* Tim Hunt (b. 1943): Through studies of sea urchins in the 1980s, Hunt discovered the role of cyclins in the regulation of cell cycle phases through their cyclical synthesis and degradation.
* Sir Paul M. Nurse (b. 1949): In the mid-1970s, Nurse&#x27;s studies uncovered the cdc2 gene in fission yeast, which is crucial for the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase and from G2 to M phase. In 1987, he identified the corresponding gene in humans, CDK1, highlighting the conservation of cell cycle control mechanisms across species.

== CDKs and cyclins in the cell cycle ==
CDK is one of the estimated 800 human protein kinases. CDKs have low molecular weight, and they are known to be inactive by themselves. They are characterized by their dependency on the regulatory subunit, cyclin. The activation of CDKs also requires post-translational modifications involving phosphorylation reactions. This phosphorylation typically occurs on a specific threonine residue, leading to a conformational change in the CDK that enhances its kinase activity. The activation forms a cyclin-CDK complex which phosphorylates specific regulatory proteins that are required to initiate steps in the cell-cycle.In human cells, the CDK family comprises 20 different members that play a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle and transcription. These are usually separated into cell-cycle CDKs, which regulate cell-cycle transitions and cell division, and transcriptional CDKs, which mediate gene transcription. CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK6, and CDK7 are directly related to the regulation of cell-cycle events, while CDK7 – 11 are associated with transcriptional regulation. Different cyclin-CDK complexes regulate different phases of the cell cycle, known as G0/G1, S, G2, and M phases, featuring several checkpoints to maintain genomic stability and ensure accurate DNA replication. Cyclin-CDK complexes of earlier cell-cycle phase help activate cyclin-CDK complexes in later phase.
== CDK structure and activation ==
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) mainly consist of a two-lobed configuration, which is characteristic of all kinases in general. CDKs have specific features in their structure that play a major role in their function and regulation.

# N-terminal lobe (N-lobe): In this part, the inhibitory element known as the glycine-rich G-loop is located. The inhibitory element is found within the beta-sheets in this N-terminal lobe. Additionally, there is a helix known as the C-helix. This helix contains the PSTAIRE sequence in CDK1. This region plays a crucial role in regulating the binding between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins.
# C-terminal lobe (C-lobe): This part contains α-helices and the activation segment, which extends from the DFG motif (D145 in CDK2) to the APE motif (E172 in CDK2). This segment also includes a phosphorylation-sensitive residue (T160 in CDK2) in the so-called T-loop. The activation segment in the C-lobe serves as a platform for the binding of the phospho-acceptor Ser/Thr region of substrates.

===Cyclin binding===

The active site, or ATP-binding site, in all kinases is a cleft located between a smaller amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxy-terminal lobe. Research on the structure of human CDK2 has shown that CDKs have a specially adapted ATP-binding site that can be regulated through the binding of cyclin. Phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinase (CAK) at Thr160 in the T-loop helps to increase the complex&#x27;s activity. Without cyclin, a flexible loop known as the activation loop or T-loop blocks the cleft, and the positioning of several key amino acids is not optimal for ATP binding. With cyclin, two alpha helices change position to enable ATP binding. One of them, the L12 helix located just before the T-loop in the primary sequence, is transformed into a beta strand and helps to reorganize the T-loop so that it no longer blocks the active site. The other alpha helix, known as the PSTAIRE helix, is reorganized and helps to change the position of the key amino acids in the active site.

There&#x27;s considerable specificity in which cyclin binds to CDK. Furthermore, the cyclin binding determines the specificity of the cyclin-CDK complex for certain substrates, highlighting the importance of distinct activation pathways that confer cyclin-binding specificity on CDK1. This illustrates the complexity and fine-tuning in the regulation of the cell cycle through selective binding and activation of CDKs by their respective cyclins.

Cyclins can directly bind the substrate or localize the CDK to a subcellular area where the substrate is found. The RXL-binding site  was crucial in revealing how CDKs selectively enhance activity toward specific substrates by facilitating substrate docking. Substrate specificity of S cyclins is imparted by the hydrophobic batch, which has affinity for substrate proteins that contain a hydrophobic RXL (or Cy) motif. Cyclin B1 and B2 can localize CDK1 to the nucleus and the Golgi, respectively, through a localization sequence outside the CDK-binding region.

===Phosphorylation===
To achieve full kinase activity, an activating phosphorylation on a threonine adjacent to the CDK&#x27;s active site is required. The identity of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) that carries out this phosphorylation varies among different model organisms. The timing of this phosphorylation also varies; in mammalian cells, the activating phosphorylation occurs after cyclin binding, while in yeast cells, it occurs before cyclin binding. CAK activity is not regulated by known cell cycle pathways, and it is the cyclin binding that is the limiting step for CDK activation.

Unlike activating phosphorylation, CDK inhibitory phosphorylation is crucial for cell cycle regulation. Various kinases and phosphatases control their phosphorylation state. For instance, the activity of CDK1 is controlled by the balance between  WEE1 kinases, Myt1 kinases, and the phosphorylation of  Cdc25c phosphatases. Wee1, a kinase preserved across all eukaryotes, phosphorylates CDK1 at Tyr 15. Myt1 can phosphorylate both the threonine (Thr 14) and the tyrosine (Tyr 15). The dephosphorylation is performed by Cdc25c phosphatases, by removing the phosphate groups from both the threonine and the tyrosine.  This inhibitory phosphorylation helps preventing cell-cycle progression in response to events like DNA damage. The phosphorylation does not significantly alter the CDK structure, but reduces its affinity to the substrate, thereby inhibiting its activity. For the cell cycle to progress, the inhibitory phosphate groups must be removed by the Cdc25 phosphatases to reactivate the CDKs.

===CDK inhibitors===

A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) is a protein that interacts with a cyclin-CDK complex to inhibit kinase activity, often during G1 phase or in response to external signals or DNA damage. In animal cells, two primary CKI families exist: the INK4 family (p16, p15, p18, p19) and the CIP/KIP family  (p21, p27, p57). The INK4 family proteins specifically bind to and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 by D-type cyclins or by CAK, while the CIP/KIP family prevent the activation of CDK-cyclin heterodimers, disrupting both cyclin binding and kinase activity. These inhibitors have a KID (kinase inhibitory domain) at the N-terminus, facilitating their attachment to cyclins and CDKs. Their primary function occurs in the nucleus, supported by a C-terminal sequence that enables their nuclear translocation.

In yeast and Drosophila, CKIs are strong inhibitors of S- and M-CDK, but do not inhibit G1/S-CDKs. During G1, high levels of CKIs prevent cell cycle events from occurring out of order, but do not prevent transition through the Start checkpoint, which is initiated through G1/S-CDKs. Once the cell cycle is initiated, phosphorylation by early G1/S-CDKs leads to destruction of CKIs, relieving inhibition on later cell cycle transitions. In mammalian cells, the CKI regulation works differently. Mammalian protein p27 (Dacapo in Drosophila) inhibits G1/S- and S-CDKs but does not inhibit S- and M-CDKs.

Ligand-based inhibition methods involve the use of small molecules or ligands that specifically bind to CDK2, which is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle. The ligands bind to the active site of CDK2, thereby blocking its activity. These inhibitors can either mimic the structure of ATP, competing for the active site and preventing protein phosphorylation needed for cell cycle progression, or bind to allosteric sites, altering the structure of CDK2 to decrease its efficiency.

=== CDK subunits (CKS) ===

CDKs are essential for the control and regulation of the cell cycle. They are associated with small regulatory subunits regulatory subunits (CKSs). In mammalian cells, two CKSs are known: CKS1 and CKS2. These proteins are necessary for the proper functioning of CDKs, although their exact functions are not yet fully known. An interaction occurs between CKS1 and the carboxy-terminal lobe of CDKs, where they bind together. This binding increases the affinity of the cyclin-CDK complex for its substrates, especially those with multiple phosphorylation sites, thus contributing the promotion of cell proliferation.

===Non-cyclin activators===

==== Viral cyclins ====
Viruses can encode proteins with sequence homology to cyclins. One much-studied example is K-cyclin (or v-cyclin) from Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (see Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma), which activates CDK6. The vCyclin-CDK6 complex promotes an accelerated transition from G1 to S phase in the cell by phosphorylating pRb and releasing E2F. This leads to the removal of inhibition on Cyclin E–CDK2&#x27;s enzymatic activity. It is shown that vCyclin contributes to promoting transformation and tumorigenesis, mainly through its effect on p27 pSer10 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration.

==== CDK5 activators ====
Two protein types, p35 and p39, responsible for increasing the activity of CDK5 during neuronal differentiation in postnatal development. p35 and p39 play a crucial role in a unique mechanism for regulating CDK5 activity in neuronal development and network formation. The activation of CDK with these cofactors (p35 and p39) does not require phosphorylation of the activation loop, which is different from the traditional activation of many other kinases. This highlights the importance of activating CDK5 activity, which is critical for proper neuronal development, dendritic spine and synapse formation, as well as in response to epileptic events.

==== RINGO/Speedy ====
Proteins in the RINGO/Speedy group represent a standout bunch among proteins that don&#x27;t share amino acid sequence homology with the cyclin family. They play a crucial role in activating CDKs. Originally identified in Xenopus, these proteins primarily bind to and activate CDK1 and CDK2, despite lacking homology to cyclins. What is particularly interesting, is that CDKs activated by RINGO/Speedy can phosphorylate different sites than those targeted by cyclin-activated CDKs, indicating a unique mode of action for these non-cyclin CDK activators.

==Medical significance==
===CDKs and cancer===
The dysregulation of CDKs and cyclins disrupts the cell cycle coordination, which makes them involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, mainly cancers. Thus, studies of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are essential for advancing the understanding of cancer characteristics. Research has shown that alterations in cyclins, CDKs, and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) are common in most cancers, involving chromosomal translocations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, gene overexpression, frame-shift mutations, missense mutations, or splicing errors.

The dysregulation of the CDK4/6-RB pathway is a common feature in many cancers, often resulting from various mechanisms that inactivate the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. Several signals can lead to overexpression of cyclin D and enhance CDK4/6 activity, contributing toward tumorigenesis. Additionally, the CDK4/6-RB pathway interacts with the p53 signaling pathway via p21CIP1 transcription, which can inhibit both cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. Mutations in p53 can deactivate the G1 checkpoint, further promoting uncontrolled proliferation.

=== CDK inhibitors and therapeutic potential ===
Due to their central role in regulating cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, CDKs are considered ideal therapeutic targets for cancer. The following CDK4/6 inhibitors mark a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering targeted therapies that are effective and have a manageable side effect profile.

# Palbociclib, one of the first CDK4/6 inhibitors approved by the FDA, has become essential in the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, often in combination with endocrine therapy.
# Ribociclib, demonstrating similar efficacy to palbociclib, is also approved for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer and offers benefits for a younger patient demographic.
# Abemaciclib stands out by being usable as monotherapy, in addition to combination treatment, for certain HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. It has also shown effectiveness in treating patients with brain metastases.
# Trilaciclib has proven its value by improving patients&#x27; quality of life during cancer treatment by reducing the risk of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, a common side effect that can lead to treatment delays and dose reductions.
=== Challenges and future potential ===
Complications of developing a CDK drug include the fact that many CDKs are not involved in the cell cycle, but other processes such as transcription, neural physiology, and glucose homeostasis. More research is required, however, because disruption of the CDK-mediated pathway has potentially serious consequences; while CDK inhibitors seem promising, it has to be determined how side-effects can be limited so that only target cells are affected. As such diseases are currently treated with glucocorticoids. The comparison with glucocorticoids serves to illustrate the potential benefits of CDK inhibitors, assuming their side effects can be more narrowly targeted or minimized.

<text>In medicine, a nebulizer (American English) or nebuliser (British English) is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of asthma, cystic fibrosis, COPD and other respiratory diseases or disorders. They use oxygen, compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that are inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device. An aerosol is a mixture of gas and solid or liquid particles.

==Medical uses==
===Guidelines===
Various asthma guidelines, such as the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines [GINA], the British Guidelines on the management of Asthma, The Canadian Pediatric Asthma Consensus Guidelines, and United States Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma each recommend metered dose inhalers in place of nebulizer-delivered therapies.
The European Respiratory Society acknowledge that although nebulizers are used in hospitals and at home they suggest much of this use may not be evidence-based.

===Effectiveness===
Recent evidence shows that nebulizers are no more effective than metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacers. An MDI with a spacer may offer advantages to children who have acute asthma. Those findings refer specifically to the treatment of asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally, as for COPD for example. For COPD, especially when assessing exacerbations or lung attacks, there is no evidence to indicate that MDI (with a spacer) delivered medicine is more effective than administration of the same medicine with a nebulizer.

The European Respiratory Society highlighted a risk relating to droplet size reproducibility caused by selling nebulizer devices separately from nebulized solution. They found this practice could vary droplet size 10-fold or more by changing from an inefficient nebulizer system to a highly efficient one.
Two advantages attributed to nebulizers, compared to MDIs with spacers (inhalers), are their ability to deliver larger dosages at a faster rate, especially in acute asthma; however, recent data suggests actual lung deposition rates are the same. In addition, another trial found that a MDI (with spacer) had a lower required dose for clinical result compared to a nebulizer.

Beyond use in chronic lung disease, nebulizers may also be used to treat acute issues like the inhalation of toxic substances. One such example is the treatment of inhalation of toxic hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapors. Calcium gluconate is a first-line treatment for HF exposure to the skin. By using a nebulizer, calcium gluconate is delivered to the lungs as an aerosol to counteract the toxicity of inhaled HF vapors.

==Aerosol deposition==
The lung deposition characteristics and efficacy of an aerosol depend largely on the particle or droplet size. Generally, the smaller the particle the greater its chance of peripheral penetration and retention. However, for very fine particles below 0.5 μm in diameter there is a chance of avoiding deposition altogether and being exhaled. In 1966 the Task Group on Lung Dynamics, concerned mainly with the hazards of inhalation of environmental toxins, proposed a model for deposition of particles in the lung. This suggested that particles of more than 10 μm in diameter are most likely to deposit in the mouth and throat, for those of 5–10 μm diameter a transition from mouth to airway deposition occurs, and particles smaller than 5 μm in diameter deposit more frequently in the lower airways and are appropriate for pharmaceutical aerosols.
Nebulizing processes have been modeled using computational fluid dynamics.

==Types==

===Pneumatic===
====Jet nebulizer====
The most commonly used nebulizers are jet nebulizers, which are also called &quot;atomizers&quot;. Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a supply of compressed gas, usually compressed air or oxygen to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an aerosol that is inhaled by the patient. Currently there seems to be a tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60 dB during use) and is less portable due to a greater weight. However, jet nebulizers are commonly used in hospitals for patients who have difficulty using inhalers, such as in serious cases of respiratory disease, or severe asthma attacks. The main advantage of the jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost. If the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pMDI can be rather expensive. Today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the jet nebulizer to just over half a kilogram (just under one and a half pounds), and therefore started to label it as a portable device. Compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers, the noise and heavy weight is still the biggest draw back of the jet nebulizer.

===Mechanical===

====Soft mist inhaler====
The medical company Boehringer Ingelheim also invented a device named Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler in 1997. This new technology provides a metered dose to the user, as the liquid bottom of the inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand, adding a buildup tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container. When the user activates the bottom of the inhaler, the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container, causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles, thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled. The device features no gas propellant and no need for battery/power to operate. The average droplet size in the mist was measured to 5.8 micrometers, which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs. Subsequent trials have proven this was not the case. Due to the very low velocity of the mist, the Soft Mist Inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pMDI. In 2000, arguments were launched towards the European Respiratory Society (ERS) to clarify/expand their definition of a nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a &quot;hand driven nebulizer&quot; and a &quot;hand driven pMDI&quot;.

===Electrical===
====Ultrasonic wave nebulizer====
Ultrasonic wave nebulizers were invented in 1965 as a new type of portable nebulizer. The technology inside an ultrasonic wave nebulizer is to have an electronic oscillator generate a high frequency ultrasonic wave, which causes the mechanical vibration of a piezoelectric element. This vibrating element is in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to produce a vapor mist via ultrasonic atomization. As they create aerosols from ultrasonic vibration instead of using a heavy air compressor, they only have a weight around . Another advantage is that the ultrasonic vibration is almost silent. Examples of these more modern type of nebulizers are: Omron NE-U17 and Beurer Nebulizer IH30.
====Vibrating mesh technology====
A new significant innovation was made in the nebulizer market around 2005, with creation of the ultrasonic Vibrating Mesh Technology (VMT). With this technology a mesh/membrane with 1000–7000 laser drilled holes vibrates at the top of the liquid reservoir, and thereby pressures out a mist of very fine droplets through the holes. This technology is more efficient than having a vibrating piezoelectric element at the bottom of the liquid reservoir, and thereby shorter treatment times are also achieved. The old problems found with the ultrasonic wave nebulizer, having too much liquid waste and undesired heating of the medical liquid, have also been solved by the new vibrating mesh nebulizers. Available VMT nebulizers include: Pari eFlow, Respironics i-Neb, Beurer Nebulizer IH50, and Aerogen Aeroneb. As the price of the ultrasonic VMT nebulizers is higher than models using previous technologies, most manufacturers continue to also sell the classic jet nebulizers.

==Use and attachments==
Nebulizers accept their medicine in the form of a liquid solution, which is often loaded into the device upon use. Corticosteroids and bronchodilators such as salbutamol (&quot;albuterol&quot; USAN) are often used, and sometimes in combination with ipratropium. The reason these pharmaceuticals are inhaled instead of ingested is in order to target their effect to the respiratory tract, which speeds onset of action of the medicine and reduces side effects, compared to other alternative intake routes.

Usually, the aerosolized medicine is inhaled through a tube-like mouthpiece, similar to that of an inhaler. The mouthpiece, however, is sometimes replaced with a face mask, similar to that used for inhaled anesthesia, for ease of use with young children or the elderly. Pediatric masks are often shaped like animals such as fish, dogs or dragons to make children less resistant to nebulizer treatments. Many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments for infants and toddlers. But mouthpieces are preferable if patients are able to use them since face-masks result in reduced lung delivery because of aerosol losses in the nose.

After use with corticosteroid, it is theoretically possible for patients to develop a yeast infection in the mouth (thrush) or hoarseness of voice (dysphonia), although these conditions are clinically very rare. To avoid these adverse effects, some clinicians suggest that the person who used the nebulizer should rinse his or her mouth. This is not true for bronchodilators; however, patients may still wish to rinse their mouths due to the unpleasant taste of some bronchodilating drugs.

==History==

The first &quot;powered&quot; or pressurized inhaler was invented in France by Sales-Girons in 1858. This device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication. The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump. When the pump is pulled up, it draws liquid from the reservoir, and upon the force of the user&#x27;s hand, the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer, to be sprayed out for inhalation near the user&#x27;s mouth.

In 1864, the first steam-driven nebulizer was invented in Germany. This inhaler, known as &quot;Siegle&#x27;s steam spray inhaler&quot;, used the Venturi principle to atomize liquid medication, and this was the very beginning of nebulizer therapy. The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds. The Siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a spirit burner, which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution. The passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor, and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass.

The first pneumatic nebulizer fed from an electrically driven gas (air) compressor was invented in the 1930s and called a Pneumostat. With this device, a medical liquid (typically epinephrine chloride, used as a bronchial muscle relaxant to reverse constriction). As an alternative to the expensive electrical nebulizer, many people in the 1930s continued to use the much more simple and cheap hand-driven nebulizer, known as the Parke-Davis Glaseptic.

In 1956, a technology competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories (3M), in the form of pressurized metered-dose inhalers, with Medihaler-iso (isoprenaline) and Medihaler-epi (epinephrine) as the two first products. In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves, driven by a gas propellant technology (i.e. Freon or a less environmentally damaging HFA).

In 1964, a new type of electronic nebulizer was introduced: the &quot;ultrasonic wave nebulizer&quot;. Today the nebulizing technology is not only used for medical purposes. Ultrasonic wave nebulizers are also used in humidifiers, to spray out water aerosols to moisten dry air in buildings.

Some of the first models of electronic cigarettes featured an ultrasonic wave nebulizer (having a piezoelectric element vibrating and creating high-frequency ultrasound waves, to cause vibration and atomization of liquid nicotine) in combination with a vapouriser (built as a spray nozzle with an electric heating element). The most common type of electronic cigarettes currently sold, however, omit the ultrasonic wave nebulizer, as it was not found to be efficient enough for this kind of device. Instead, the electronic cigarettes now use an electric vaporizer, either in direct contact with the absorbent material in the &quot;impregnated atomizer,&quot; or in combination with the nebulization technology related to a &quot;spraying jet atomizer&quot; (in the form of liquid droplets being out-sprayed by a high-speed air stream, that passes through some small venturi injection channels, drilled in a material absorbed with nicotine liquid).

<text>A cyclin-dependent kinase complex (CDKC, cyclin-CDK) is a protein complex formed by the association of an inactive catalytic subunit of a protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), with a regulatory subunit, cyclin. Once cyclin-dependent kinases bind to cyclin, the formed complex is in an activated state. Substrate specificity of the activated complex is mainly established by the associated cyclin within the complex. Activity of CDKCs is controlled by phosphorylation of target proteins, as well as binding of inhibitory proteins.

== Structure and Regulation ==


The structure of CDKs in complex with a cyclin subunits (CDKC) has long been a goal of structural and cellular biologists starting in the 1990s when the structure of unbound cyclin A was solved by Brown et al. and in the same year Jeffery et al. solved the structure of human cyclin A-CDK2 complex to 2.3 Angstrom resolution. Since this time, many CDK structures have been determined to higher resolution, including the structures of CDK2 and CDK2 bound to a variety of substrates, as seen in Figure 1.
High resolution structures exist for approximately 25 CDK-cyclin complexes in total within the Protein Data Bank. Based on function, there are two general populations of CDK-cyclin complex structures, open and closed form. The difference between the forms lies within the binding of cyclin partners where closed form complexes have CDK-cyclin binding at both the C and N-termini of the activation loop of the CDK, whereas the open form partners bind only at the N-terminus. Open form structures correspond most often to those complexes involved in transcriptional regulation (CDK 8, 9, 12, and 13), while closed form CDK-cyclin complex are most often involved in cell cycle progression and regulation (CDK 1, 2, 6). These distinct roles, however, do not significantly differ with the sequence homology between the CDK components. In particular, among these known structures there appear to be four major conserved regions: a N-terminal Glycine-rich loop, a Hinge Region, an αC-helix, and a T-loop regulation site.

=== Activation Loop ===
The activation loop, also referred to as the T-loop, is the region of CDK (between the DFG and APE motifs in many CDK) that is enzymatically active when CDK is bound to its function-specific partner. In CDK-cyclin complexes, this activation region is composed of a conserved αL-12 Helix and contains a key phosphorylatable residue (usually Threonine for CDK-cyclin partners, but also includes Serine and Tyrosine) that mediates the enzymatic activity of the CDK. It is at this essential residue (T160 in CDK2 complexes, T177 in CDK6 complexes) that enzymatic ATP-phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes by CAK (cyclin activating kinase, referring to the CDK7-Cyclin H complex in human cells) takes place. After the hydrolysis of ATP to phosphorylate at this site, these complexes are able to complete their intended function, the phosphorylation of cellular targets. It is important to note that in CDK 1, 2 and 6, the T-loop and a separate C-terminal region are the major sites of cyclin binding in the CDK, and which cyclins are bound to each of these CDK is mediated by the particular sequence of the activation site T-loop. These cyclin binding sites are the regions of highest variability in CDKs despite relatively high sequence homology surrounding the αL-12 Helix motif of this structural component.

=== Glycine-rich region ===
The glycine-rich loop (Gly-rich loop) as seen in residues 12-16 in CDK2 encodes a conserved GXGXXG motif across both yeast and animal models. The regulatory region is subject to differential phosphorylation at non-glycine residues within this motif, making this site subject to Wee1 and/or Myt1 inhibitory kinase phosphorylation and Cdc25 de-phosphorylation in mammals. This reversible phosphorylation at the Gly-rich loop in CDK2 occurs at Y15, where activity has been further studied. Study of this residue has shown that phosphorylation promotes a conformational change that prevents ATP and substrate binding by steric interference with these necessary binding sites in the activation loop of the CDK-cyclin complexes. This activity is aided by the notable flexibility that the Gly-rich loop has within the structure of most CDK allowing for its rotation toward the activation loop to have a significant effect on reducing substrate affinity without major changes in the overall CDK-cyclin complex structure.

=== Hinge Region ===
The conserved hinge region of CDK within eukaryotic cells acts as an essential bridge between the Gly-rich loop and the activation loop. CDK are characterized by a N-terminal lobe that is primarily twisted beta-sheet connected via this hinge region to an alpha helix dominated C-terminal lobe. In discussion of the T-loop and the Gly-rich loop, it is important to note that these regions, which must be able to spatially interact in order to carry out their biochemical functions, lie on opposite lobes of the CDK itself. Thus, this hinge region, which can vary in length slightly between CDK type and CDK-cyclin complex, connects essential regulatory regions of the CDK by connecting these lobes, and plays key roles in the resulting structure of CDK-cyclin complexes by properly orienting ATP for easy catalysis of phosphorylation reactions by the assembled complex. 

=== αC-Helix ===
The αC-Helix region is highly conserved across many of the mammalian kinome (family of kinases). Its main responsibility is to maintain allosteric control of the kinase active site. This control manifests in CDK-cyclin complexes by specifically preventing CDK activity until its binds to its partner regulator (i.e. cyclin or other partner protein). This binding causes a conformational change in the αC-Helix region of the CDK and allows for it to be moved from the active site cleft and completes the initial process of T-loop activation. Given that this region is so conserved across the protein superfamily of kinases, this mechanism where the αC-Helix has been shown to fold out of the N-terminal lobe of the kinase, allowing for increased access to the αL-12 Helix that lies within the T-loop, is considered a potential target for drug development.

==The cell cycle==

===Yeast cell cycle===
Although these complexes have a variety functions, CDKCs are most known for their role in the cell cycle. Initially, studies were conducted in &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (yeast). &quot;S. pombe&quot; and &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; are most known for their association with a single Cdk, Cdc2 and Cdc28 respectively, which complexes with several different cyclins. Depending on the cyclin, various portions of the cell cycle are affected. For example, in &quot;S. pombe&quot;, Cdc2 associates with Cdk13 to form the Cdk13-Cdc2 complex. In &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, the association of Cdc28 with cyclins, Cln1, Cln2, or Cln3, results in the transition from G1 phase to S phase. Once in the S phase, Cln1 and Cln2 dissociates with Cdc28 and complexes between Cdc28 and Clb5 or Clb6 are formed. In G2 phase, complexes formed from the association between Cdc28 and Clb1, Clb2, Clb3, or Clb4, results in the progression from G2 phase to M (Mitotic) phase. These complexes are present in early M phase as well. See Table 1 for a summary of yeast CDKCs.

; Table 1. CDKCs Associated with Cell Cycle Phases in Yeast
From what is known about the complexes formed during each phase of the cell cycle in yeast, proposed models have emerged based on important phosphorylation sites and transcription factors involved.

===Mammalian cell cycle===
Using the information discovered through yeast cell cycle studies, significant progress has been made regarding the mammalian cell cycle. It has been determined that the cell cycles are similar and CDKCs, either directly or indirectly, affect the progression of the cell cycle. As previously mentioned, in yeast, only one cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is associated with several different cyclins. However, in mammalian cells, several different CDKs bind to various cyclins to form CDKCs. For instance, Cdk1 (also known as human Cdc2), the first human CDK to be identified, associates with cyclins A or B. CyclinA/B-Cdk1 complexes drive the transition between G2 phase and M phase, as well as early M phase. Another mammalian CDK, Cdk2, can form complexes with cyclins D1, D2, D3, E, or A. Cdk4 and Cdk6 interact with cyclins D1, D2, and D3. Studies have indicated that there is no difference between CDKCs cyclin D1-Cdk4/6, therefore, any unique properties can possibly be linked to substrate specificity or activation. While levels of CDKs remain fairly constant throughout the cell cycle, cyclin levels fluctuate. The fluctuation controls the activation of the cyclin-CDK complexes and ultimately the progression throughout the cycle. See Table 2 for a summary of mammalian cell CDKCs involved in the cell cycle.

; Table 2. CDKCs Associated with Cell Cycle Phases in Mammalian Cells

====G1 to S phase progression====
During late G1 phase, CDKCs bind and phosphorylate members of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family. Members of the Rb protein family are tumor suppressors, which prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation that would occur during tumor formation. However, pRbs are also thought to repress the genes required in order for the transition from G1 phase to S phase to occur. When the cell is ready to transition into the next phase, CDKCs, cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin D1-Cdk6 phosphorylate pRB, followed by additional phosphorylation from the cyclin E-Cdk2 CDKC. Once phosphorylation occurs, transcription factors are then released to irreversibly inactivate pRB and progression into the S phase of the cell cycle ensues. The cyclin E-Cdk2 CDKC formed in the G1 phase then aids in the initiation of DNA replication during S phase.

====G2 to M phase progression====
At the end of S phase, cyclin A is associated with Cdk1 and Cdk2. During G2 phase, cyclin A is degraded, while cyclin B is synthesized and cyclin B-Cdk1 complexes form. Not only are cyclin B-Cdk1 complexes important for the transition into M phase, but these CDKCs play a role in the following regulatory and structural processes: 
* Chromosomal condensation
* Fragmentation of Golgi network
* Breakdown of nuclear lamina

Inactivation of the cyclin B-Cdk1 complex through the degradation of cyclin B is necessary for exit out of the M phase of the cell cycle.

==Other==
Even though the majority of the known CDKCs are involved in the cell cycle, not all kinase complexes function in this manner. Studies have shown other CDKCs, such as cyclin k-Cdk9 and cyclin T1-Cdk9, are involved in the replication stress response, and influence transcription. Additionally, cyclin H-Cdk7 complexes may play a role in meiosis in male germ cells, and has been shown to be involved in transcriptional activities as well.

<text>Anthony Asquith (; 9 November 1902 – 20 February 1968) was an English film director. He collaborated successfully with playwright Terence Rattigan on &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1951), among other adaptations. His other notable films include &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938), &quot;French Without Tears&quot; (1940), &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945) and a 1952 adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. 

==Life and career==
Born in London, he was the son of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916, and Margot Asquith, who was responsible for &#x27;Puffin&#x27; as his family nickname. He was educated at Eaton House, Winchester College and Balliol College, Oxford.

The film industry was viewed as disreputable when Asquith was young, and according to the actor Jonathan Cecil, a family friend, Asquith entered this profession in order to escape his background. At the end of the 1920s, he began his career with the direction of four silent films, the last of which, &quot;A Cottage on Dartmoor&quot;, established his reputation with its meticulous and often emotionally moving frame composition. &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938) was based on the George Bernard Shaw play featuring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.

He made several films for Edward Black at Gainsborough.

Asquith was a longtime friend and colleague of Terence Rattigan (they collaborated on ten films) and producer Anatole de Grunwald. His later films included Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1951), and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952).

Asquith served as President of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians and as a Governor of the British Film Institute. 

Asquith was an alcoholic and, according to actor Jonathan Cecil, a repressed homosexual. He died in 1968. He was buried at All Saints Churchyard, Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, England.

<text>Luigi Carnera (born in Trieste April 14, 1875, died in Florence, July 30, 1962) was an Italian astronomer and mathematician. He discovered 16 minor planets in the early 20th century. The main-belt asteroid 39653 Carnera was named in his honour.

In his early career he worked as Max Wolf&#x27;s assistant at Heidelberg, Germany he discovered a number of asteroids. He worked in Germany, Italy and Argentina before returning to Italy for good in 1908.

He was director of Trieste Observatory starting in 1919; Trieste had just been annexed to Italy following World War I. He then became director of Capodimonte Observatory in Naples starting in 1932 and until his retirement in 1950. In 1943 during World War II, the observatory was temporarily occupied by American and British troops in order to install a radar station.

<text>The University of Montana (UM) is a public research university in Missoula, Montana. UM is a flagship institution of the Montana University System and its second largest campus. Fall 2024 saw total enrollment hit 10,811, marking the highest total enrollment for UM since 2018.

It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; as of 2022.

The University of Montana ranks 17th in the nation and fifth among public universities in producing Rhodes Scholars; it has 11 Truman Scholars, 14 Goldwater Scholars, and 40 Udall Scholars to its name. One alumnus, Harold Urey, has won the Nobel Prize.

==History==
An act of Congress of February 18, 1881, dedicated 72 sections () in Montana Territory for the creation of the university.

Montana was admitted to the Union on November 8, 1889, and the state legislature soon began to consider where the state&#x27;s permanent capital and state university would be located. To be sure that the new state university would be located in Missoula, the city&#x27;s leaders made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over its leading competitor, Anaconda. The cities&#x27; bids were supported by the rival &quot;Copper Kings&quot;, William A. Clark and Marcus Daly, respectively.

Missoula won the legislative vote for the new university at the Third Montana Legislative Assembly in February 1893, and it was formally opened in 1895. While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were temporarily held at nearby Willard School. The South Missoula Land Company, owned by A.B. Hammond, Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly, joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus. In June 1898 the cornerstone for A.J. Gibson designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became &quot;the University City&quot;.

From 1945 until 1965, the name was changed by the legislature to &quot;Montana State University&quot;, while the school in Bozeman was known as &quot;Montana State College&quot;.

==Academics==
The University of Montana comprises eleven full colleges and schools: College of Humanities &amp; Sciences; Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences; W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation; College of Health Professions and Biomedical Sciences; College of Visual and Performing Arts; Alexander Blewett III School of Law; UM College of Business; UM School of Journalism; UM School of Extended and Lifelong Learning; Missoula College and Bitterroot College.

The Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences is divided into five academic departments and the Institute of Educational Research and Service. In 1914, the University of Montana School of Law became a member of The Association of American Law Schools and in 1923, the school received accreditation from the American Bar Association. The W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation offers five undergraduate majors (Ecosystem Science &amp; Restoration; Forestry; Parks, Tourism &amp; Recreation Management; Resource Conservation; and Wildlife Biology) and five Master&#x27;s of Science and three PhDs.

===Admissions===
For the fall 2017 term, 6,182 students applied to the University of Montana. Ninety-three percent were accepted. The entering freshman class had an average high school GPA of 3.55, and the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 540-650 for reading and writing, 520-620 for math, while the ACT Composite range was 21–26.

==Campus==

The original plan of the campus was designed by one of its first professors, Frederich Scheuch, who called for the central oval to be surrounded by immediate and future university buildings. Although Scheuch&#x27;s plan called for all building entrances to face the center of the Oval, forming a radiating building pattern, buildings were later constructed with three-story in the Renaissance Revival style, with hipped roofs and Spanish green roof tiles.

The first set of buildings were set up around the oval in 1895. Since that time, various campus plans and architectural styles have been used. Today the campus consists of and is bordered to the east by Mount Sentinel and the north by the Clark Fork River. The main campus comprises 64 buildings, including nine residence halls and various athletic venues, including Washington–Grizzly Stadium, a 26,500-seat football stadium and the Adams Center (formerly, Dahlberg Arena), a 7,500-seat multi-purpose arena where the university&#x27;s basketball teams play.

Landmarks include:

;The Oval
A swath of grass running east to west, marking the traditional center of the university. Today it is divided into quadrants by two intersecting brick-laid paths, though originally the oval was solid grass and forbidden to be crossed by students. A double row of trees was planted around the oval on Arbor Day 1896, but many of the trees have since died and are in the process of being replanted. The original gravel driveway that once surrounded the Oval has also been replaced by sidewalk. The original master plan of the university called for all buildings to face the center of the oval, but this plan proved difficult and a new plan was created in 1935.

On the western extreme of the Oval is a life-sized grizzly bear statue created by ceramic artist and sculptor Rudy Autio in 1969. The bronze statue is in height, weighs , and took a year to create. Many photographs of the university picture the bear with the Oval, university (Main) Hall, and Mount Sentinel&#x27;s &#x27;M&#x27; in the background.

;The &quot;M&quot; trail
A trail with 13 switchbacks, it ascends , from above sea level, from the university at the base of Mount Sentinel. The trail offers sweeping views of the city below.

There is debate of when &quot;The &#x27;M&#x27;&quot; was first placed on Mount Sentinel. Around 1908, members of the Forestry Club forged a zigzag trail up the mountain and students carried up stones to shape the symbol of the University of Montana. Originally made of whitewashed rocks and only measuring by 25 feet, the very first &quot;M&quot; was poorly constructed and ultimately replaced by a wooden &quot;M&quot; in 1912, which cost $18. That &quot;M,&quot; unlike today&#x27;s &quot;M,&quot; stood upright on the face of Mount Sentinel. A larger wooden version of the &quot;M&quot; was built in 1913 and upkeep of the structure was formally charged to each year&#x27;s freshman class.

When the large wooden &quot;M&quot; was destroyed by a blizzard in 1915, an even larger version was constructed of whitewashed granite. Once again the freshman class was tasked with annual renovation of the symbol, beginning a new tradition. Each year from then on, University of Montana freshmen made the hike up to the &quot;M&quot; to apply a fresh coat of whitewash and remove any weeds and grass that had grown in and around the structure.

The annual tradition ended in 1968 when a concrete &quot;M&quot; was built at a cost of $4,328. Behind the decision to replace rock with concrete were maintenance issues; with the coming of the 1960s, UM students exhibited waning enthusiasm for the annual trek up the hill and for annual upkeep of the &quot;M&quot;. Although the annual whitewashing went by the wayside, one tradition that lives on today is the lighting of the &quot;M&quot; during the university&#x27;s annual Homecoming celebration each fall. Originally lit by a group of students on October 9, 1919, following the fall whitewashing, the event was so popular that students have continued to light the &quot;M&quot; each year during Homecoming week; special beacons light up the giant letter, welcoming former students back to the university.

;Memorial Row
On the north side of campus, 29 evergreen trees stand in two columns forming Memorial Row along what used to be the path of Van Buren Avenue. The trees, running from the corner of the Oval to Eddy Avenue, were planted in 1919 following the end of the Great War to honor UM students, alumni, and faculty who died in the war, some to combat and many more to the influenza epidemic. The trees are &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; (Western Yellow Pines or Ponderosa Pine), the state tree of Montana. Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors; in 1925, these were replaced with 35 brass nameplates atop concrete markers. At the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row. It lists 21 of the 31 honorees from 1919. By 1925, the university had increased the number of names on the official list to 35, and sometime later, it grew to 37.

==Organization and administration==
===Administration===
The University of Montana is the main campus for the university, which includes four other campuses. The public university system is one of two in Montana; the other is Montana State University. Both systems are governed as the Montana University System by the Montana Board of Regents, which consists of seven members appointed by the state governor, and confirmed by the state Senate to serve overlapping terms of seven years, except for one student member who is appointed for one year at a time.. The governor and Superintendent of Public Instruction, both statewide elected officials, are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Board, as is the Commissioner of Higher Education, who is appointed by the Board of Regents.

The Board of Regents appoints the university president, who is directly responsible and accountable to the Commissioner of Higher Education.

===Funding===

The total operating budget for the University of Montana for fiscal year 2017 was approximately $423 million. About $149 million comes from the General Funds budget, $108 million from restricted funds, auxiliary funds ($51 million), designated funds ($44 million), and plant funds ($61 million).

Over the past 30 years, state support for higher education has dropped dramatically. In 1990, the State of Montana provided for 69% of the educational and general funds budget. It now supports 33% of the general fund or 13% of the university&#x27;s operating budget. This decrease in funding has, in part, been made up by the university competing for sponsored research money with a growth from $12 million in 1994 to $88 million in 2017 and salaries as low as 3/5 the national average.

===Colleges, schools, and centers===
The University of Montana comprises seven colleges and two professional schools:

* College of Humanities and Sciences (1893)
*Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences (2009)
*W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation (1913)
*College of Health Professions and Biomedical Sciences
**Skaggs School of Pharmacy (1907)
**School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science
**School of Social Work
**School of Public and Community Health Sciences
*Missoula College (1956)
**College of Technology
**Bitterroot College (Hamilton, MT)
*College of the Arts and Media
**School of Art
**School of Theatre and Dance
**School of Media Arts
**School of Music (1893)
**School of Journalism (1914)
* Davidson Honors College (1991)
*College of Business (1918)
*School of Law (1911)

The University of Montana is also home to a variety of projects, research centers, and institutes.

==Campus media==
The &quot;Montana Kaimin&quot;, founded in 1898, is the student-run college newspaper. It is independent of the university. It attracted national attention in 2009, when football coach Bobby Hauck refused to take questions from the paper in retaliation for a story about an alleged assault by two Grizzly football players. The &quot;Montanan&quot; is the university&#x27;s alumni magazine, published by the University Relations office. &quot;CutBank&quot;, founded in 1973 by the Creative Writing Program, is a literary magazine. &quot;Camas: The Nature of the West&quot;, is a literary journal run by graduate students of the Environmental Studies Program.

KBGA (89.9 FM) is the college radio station. KUFM-FM is the flagship and founding station of Montana Public Radio. Founded in 1965, its studios are located in the Broadcast Media Center, of the Performing Arts/Radio Television Center. KUFM-TV (Channel 11) is the local Montana PBS station.

==Student life==

A variety of student organizations exist on campus. Seven fraternities and four sororities have chapters on campus. The fraternities are Phi Delta Theta (1921), Sigma Nu (established at UM in 1904), Sigma Chi (1905), Sigma Phi Epsilon (1918), Sigma Alpha Epsilon (1927), and Kappa Sigma (1927). The sororities are Kappa Alpha Theta (1909), Kappa Kappa Gamma (1909), Delta Gamma (1911), and Alpha Phi (1918).

The University of Montana&#x27;s International Program began as the International Student club in 1924. It was founded by Alex Stepanzoff and four other Russians who were the first foreign exchange students at the university and is the oldest student organization at the university. The first study abroad programs were created with programs to France, Germany, and Spain in 1971. In 1981, the Mansfield Center was established and certification in teaching of English as a second language (TESL) began. As of 2010, the university has partnerships established with over 90 universities in over 40 countries. The largest number of partnership are with universities in Japan (eight), China (seven), and Chile (seven).

Programs on Central and Southwest Asia were created in 1997. UM is currently the only American university offering a Bachelor of Arts in Central and Southwest Asian Studies. In September 2010, the Montana Board of Regents unanimously approved the creation of the Center for the Study of Central and Southwest Asia at The University of Montana.

==Transportation==
* A parking permit or guest pass is required to park on the UM and Missoula College campuses throughout the year, Monday-Friday 7 am - 5 pm. Areas that are marked as reserved are leased spaces and are not available to use by anyone other than the reserved space owner. Day parking passes for visitors cost $3.50.

* UDASH is the late night shuttle service that runs every half hour from campus to Lewis &amp; Clark (student housing), back to campus and then downtown.
* The ASUM Cruiser Co-op program allows students to check out yellow cruiser bike (unisex, with lights, basket, and lock) for up to two days for free with a Griz Card.

==Athletics==
The athletic teams are nicknamed the Montana Grizzlies, often shortened to Griz or Lady Griz (Lady Griz is only used when referring to the women&#x27;s basketball team; all other women&#x27;s teams are known as the Griz). The university has competed in the NCAA&#x27;s Big Sky Conference since the conference was formed in 1963. From 1924 to 1950, the University of Montana was a member of the Pacific Coast Conference (precursor to today&#x27;s Pac-12). The University of Montana has an ongoing rivalry with Montana State University, most notably the cross-state football matchups, known as the &quot;Brawl of the Wild&quot;, but also includes the cross-state club lacrosse matchup, known as the &quot;Copper Cup&quot;.

Programs include:
*Montana Grizzlies football – Since the 1990s, the Griz have established themselves as one of the most dominant football teams in both the Big Sky Conference and in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (known as Division I-AA football before 2006). They won the I-AA national title in 1995 and 2001.
*Montana Grizzlies men&#x27;s basketball – The men&#x27;s basketball team has established itself in recent years as a power in the Big Sky, and was the conference representative to the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2005, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2018, and 2019. At the 2006 tournament, the 12th-seeded Griz upset fifth-seeded University of Nevada, Reno, 87–79, the school&#x27;s first win in the tournament in 31 years. The Cinderella run ended against the fourth-seeded Boston College Eagles.
*Montana Grizzlies women&#x27;s basketball – The women&#x27;s basketball team is the most successful team in the Big Sky Conference. The Lady Griz have won 17 conference titles in 25 years, most recently in 2012, and have competed in the NCAA Women&#x27;s tournament 17 times. The Lady Griz were coached from 1978 to 2016 by Robin Selvig (Montana, 1974), who had an overall record of 865–286 (.752 winning percentage). Selvig earned his 600th win in just 772 games, the sixth fastest of any NCAA coach (men or women). Selvig finished his career ranked eighth among all women&#x27;s basketball coaches in victories with 865. Since 2016, the team is coached by former Lady Griz star Shannon Schweyen.

The mascot of the university is Monte, a Grizzly Bear. In 1897, a live bear cub traveled with UM&#x27;s football team, then known as the &quot;Bears&quot; (the &quot;Grizzlies&quot; name was adopted in 1923). Numerous live bear cubs who served as university mascots, first named &quot;Teddy&quot;, then &quot;Fessy&quot; and finally, in the 1960s, &quot;Cocoa&quot;. UM&#x27;s costumed mascot during the 1980s, dubbed &quot;Otto&quot;, donned a variety of fun-loving outfits to entertain crowds at Grizzly football games. Monte (short for &quot;Montana&quot;) was born in the mountains of Missoula in the fall 1993. The 2002–03 and 2004–05 National Champion Mascot of the Year (Capital One/ESPN) has evolved into a &quot;motorcycle-riding, break-dancing, back flipping, slam-dunking, movie-making, crowd-surfing, goal post smashing, prank-pulling superstar.&quot;

<doc id="619236" wikidata="Q37550" url="?curid=619236" title="Boston Terrier">
<text>The Boston Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United States of America. This &quot;American Gentleman&quot; was accepted in 1893 by the American Kennel Club as a non-sporting breed. Boston Terriers are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears.

The Boston Terrier ranked as the 24th most popular breed in registrations with the American Kennel Club in 2022.

== History ==

The Boston terrier breed originated around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston purchased from a man named William O&#x27;Brien a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper&#x27;s Judge), which was of a bull and terrier type lineage. Hooper&#x27;s Judge is directly related to the original bull and terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper&#x27;s Judge as the ancestor of nearly all true modern Boston Terriers.

Judge weighed about . Judge was bred to Edward Burnett&#x27;s bitch named Gyp (or Kate). Gyp was a white bulldog-type female, owned by Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts. She weighed about , was stocky and strong and had the typical blocky head now shown in Bostons. From this foundation of the breed, subsequent breeders refined the breed into its modern-day presentation. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the bull and terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to (Old Boston Bulldogs).

The Boston Terrier Club was formed in 1891; it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club in 1893. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States.

In the early years, the color and markings were not very important to the breed&#x27;s standard. By the 20th century the breed&#x27;s distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. Boston University has used Rhett the Boston Terrier as their mascot since 1922. The Boston Terrier has also been the official state dog of Massachusetts since 1979.

== Description ==

The Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite. The chest is broad and the tail is short. According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than . Boston Terriers usually stand up to at the withers.

The American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds.

=== Coat and color ===
The Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal (seal appears as black with a red cast in lighting), or a combination of the three. Solid colours and colours not mentioned are not accepted by the breed standard. 
According to the American Kennel Club, the Boston Terrier&#x27;s markings are broken down into two categories: Required, which consists of a white chest, white muzzle band, and a white band between the eyes; and Desired, which includes the Required markings plus a white collar, white on the forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier&#x27;s markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as &quot;the American Gentleman.&quot;

=== Notable features ===
The Boston Terrier&#x27;s large, prominent pair of eyes is a distinguishable feature. The breed&#x27;s round eyes are set widely apart, are large in size, and located squarely in the skull.

The breed&#x27;s genetic makeup produces a short tail. These short tails can take the shape of a corkscrew, or curl, or they can be straight. Generally, Boston Terriers&#x27; tails do not exceed in length.

== Temperament ==
Boston Terrier is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humor. Boston Terriers are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers.

Both females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary. Their usually sensible attitude toward barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets, if properly socialized.

== Health ==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Curvature of the back, called roaching, might be caused by patella problems with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs.

The Boston Terrier is a brachycephalic breed of dog. Brachycephaly refers to the shortened muzzle of the breed which results in a pushed-in appearance of the face. Brachycephaly results in deformation of the upper airway tract and leads to obstruction of breathing. Effects of brachycephaly are stridor, stertorous breathing, emesis, skin fold dermatitis, brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome, exophthalmos, pharyngeal gag reflex, cyanosis, and laryngeal collapse. Other issues arising from brachycephaly are risk of complications whilst under anaesthesia, and hyperthermia — with the latter caused due to an inability to effectively reduce body temperature via panting.

Bostons frequently require caesarean section to give birth, with over 80% of litters in a UK Kennel Club survey delivered this way. A UK study found Boston Terrier bitches to be 12.9 times more likely to experience dystocia.

The breed is predisposed to the following dermatological conditions: atopic dermatitis, allergic skin disease, demodicosis, hyperadrenocorticism, mast cell tumour, pattern alopecia, and zinc-responsive dermatosis.

A study in North America of veterinary records of almost 10,000 Boston Terriers and over 1,000,000 dogs found 0.36% of Boston Terriers to have hip dysplasia compared to 3.52% overall.

The Boston Terrier is one of the most commonly affected breeds for hereditary cataracts.

== Popular Boston Terriers ==
In 1921 at a ceremony to commemorate the United States&#x27; 102nd Infantry, the U.S. Army awarded a gold medal to an honorable war dog: Sergeant Stubby. The Boston Bull Terrier, possessing three service stripes and one wound stripe, was given a rank in the U.S. Army-making him the first dog to ever earn it. The comforting, protective war dog was also rewarded a medal by France. Sergeant Stubby died in 1926 with the legacy of being the United States&#x27; &quot;greatest war dog.&quot;

Wofford College in Spartanburg, SC has had a live Boston Terrier mascot named Blitz since 2003 that attends home football games.

In 2012, a high school student named Victoria Reed took the advice of her veterinarian and submitted a photo of her Boston Terrier, Bruschi, to Guinness World Records. With each eye being 1.1 inches, or 28 mm, in diameter, Bruschi is recognized by Guinness to be the dog with the largest eyes.

Lennu, the pet from 2012 to 2021 of Sauli Niinistö, the President of Finland, was present at many of his less formal appearances and well known in Finland. Photos of the pair went viral in the United States in 2017.

<text>Salamanca Place is a precinct of Hobart, the capital city of the Australian state of Tasmania.

Salamanca Place itself consists of rows of sandstone buildings, formerly warehouses for the port of Hobart Town that have since been converted into restaurants, galleries (including the Salamanca Arts Centre), craft shops and offices. It was named after the victory in 1812 of the Duke of Wellington in the Battle of Salamanca in the Spanish province of Salamanca. It was previously called &quot;The Cottage Green&quot;.

Each Saturday, Salamanca Place is the site for the Salamanca Market, which is popular with tourists and locals. The markets are ranked as one of the most popular tourist attractions visited each year. During Dark Mofo the trees are decorated with red fairy lights.

Salamanca Place is also popular after dark with both locals and visitors enjoying bars and eateries located there and the nearby wharves.

There are many laneways and several squares adjacent to Salamanca Place, such as Kelly&#x27;s Steps, built during the whaling industry boom in the early and mid-19th century. In the mid-1990s, &quot;Salamanca Square&quot;, a sheltered public square was built. Ringed by shops, cafes, and restaurants, the centrepiece fountain and its lawns are a safe environment where children play alongside individuals and families. There is also an adjoining undercover carpark and some apartment complexes and hotels, such as the Moss Hotel, Silos and Salamanca Wharf on Castray Esplanade, and the Lenna and Salamanca Suites towards Battery Point.

Salamanca Place is featured as a property in the Australian version of Monopoly.

<text>Andrew Parsons (July 22, 1817 – June 6, 1855) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served as the 9th lieutenant governor of Michigan and as the 10th governor of Michigan.

==Early life in New York==
Parsons was born in Hoosick, New York. He was the son of John Parsons, and the grandson of Andrew Parsons, a Revolutionary soldier, who was the son of Phineas Parsons, the son of Samuel Parsons.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
Parsons moved to Michigan Territory in 1835 and spent the summer teaching in Ann Arbor. In the fall, he explored nearly the entire length of the Grand River valley by canoe, from Jackson to Lake Michigan. He spent the winter working as a store clerk in Ionia County and in the spring went to Marshall to live with his brother, Luke H. Parsons. In the fall of 1836, he moved to Corunna in what was to become Shiawassee County. This area at that time was mostly wilderness, and when it was organized into a county in 1837, Parsons was elected the county&#x27;s first clerk at the age of nineteen.

Parsons became an attorney, and in 1840 was elected Register of Deeds, then reelected in 1842 and 1844. In 1846, he was elected to the Michigan State Senate from the sixth district and was appointed Prosecuting Attorney in 1848. He became a Regent of the University of Michigan in 1851 and was also elected as ninth lieutenant governor of Michigan in 1852.

Parsons became the tenth governor of Michigan when Robert McClelland resigned in March 1853 to become the Secretary of the Interior under U.S. President Franklin Pierce. During his twenty-two months as governor, tax laws were improved and the practice of depositing surplus state funds in banks was opposed. Parsons did not receive the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1854. This may have been because the party was split by the question of slavery and by the formation of the Republican Party (which held its first convention that year in Jackson, Michigan).

==Retirement and death==
In 1855, Parsons was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives from Shiawassee County district. He soon fell ill and retired to his farm in Corunna where he died at the age of 37, just five months after leaving office as governor. He is interred at Pinetree Cemetery in Corunna.

He was married to Marrietta Clason and had four children.

His brother, S. Titus Parsons, years later, was also a member of the state house from the same district from 1863 to 1864 and 1867–68, as well as a delegate to Michigan state constitutional convention in 1867.

<text>Ibrahim Muteferrika (; 1674–1745 CE) was a Hungarian-born Ottoman diplomat, publisher, economist, historian, Islamic theologian, sociologist, and the first Muslim to run a printing press with movable Arabic type.

==Early life==
Ibrahim Muteferrika was born in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca, Romania). He was an ethnic Hungarian Unitarian who converted to Islam, but his original Hungarian name is unknown.

==Diplomatic service==
At a young age, Ibrahim Muteferrika entered the Ottoman diplomatic services. He took an active part in the negotiations with Austria and Russia. Ibrahim Muteferrika was an active figure in promoting the Ottoman-French alliance (1737–1739) against Austria and Russia. Ibrahim Muteferrika was also acclaimed for his role in the Ottoman-Swedish action against Russia.

During his services as a diplomat, he is known to have befriended many influential personalities including Osman Aga of Temesvar, a fellow diplomat of Transylvanian origins and former prisoner-of-war imprisoned in Austria.

It was during his years as a diplomat that he took a keen interest in collecting books that helped him understand the ongoing Renaissance, the emergence of Protestant movements in Europe, and the rise of powerful colonial empires in Europe.

==Printing press==

The printing press had already been known in the Ottoman Empire since 1493 or 1504 in Hebrew characters. Other communities operated presses. The first Ottoman press using movable Arabic type was operated in 1706–1711 in Aleppo by Christians.

Muteferrika&#x27;s volumes, printed in Istanbul and using custom-made fonts, are occasionally referred to as &quot;Turkish incunabula&quot;. Muteferrika, whose last name derived from his employment as a , or head of the household, under Sultan Ahmed III and during the Tulip Era, was also a geographer, astronomer, and philosopher.

Following a 1726 report on the efficiency of the new system, which he drafted and presented simultaneously to Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, the Grand Mufti, and the clergy, and a later request submitted to Sultan Ahmed III, he received permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some Islamic calligraphers and religious leaders). Muteferrika&#x27;s press published its first book in 1729, and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes (each having between 500 and 1,000 copies). The first book ever published by Muteferrika is &quot;Vankulu Lügati&quot;, a 2-volume Arabic-Turkish dictionary. Printing religious books was prohibited until 1803.

Among the works published by Müteferrika were historical and generically scientific works, as well as Katip Çelebi&#x27;s world atlas &quot;Cihannüma&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;The Mirror of the World&quot; or the &quot;World Seer&quot;). In a digression that he added to his printing, Müteferrika discussed the heliocentrism of astronomy in detail, with references to relatively up-to-date scientific arguments for and against it. In that regard, he is considered one of the first people to properly introduce heliocentrism to Ottoman readers.

After 1742, however, Ibrahim Muteferrika&#x27;s printing activities were discontinued and an attempt by the British diplomat James Mario Matra, motivated by the exorbitant prices for manuscript books, to re-establish a press in Istanbul was aborted in 1779. In his account, Matra refers to the strong opposition of the scribes that Müteferrika&#x27;s enterprise had faced:

==Legacy==
A statue of Muteferrika can be found in the Sahaflar Çarşısı adjacent to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.

== Books published ==
There were 17 titles published by Muteferrika at his press during his lifetime:

# &quot;Kitab-ı Lügat-ı Vankulu (Sihah El-Cevheri)&quot;, 2 volumes, 1729
# &quot;Tuhfet-ül Kibar fi Esfar el-Bihar&quot;, 1729
# &quot;Tarih-i Seyyah&quot;, 1729
# &quot;Tarih-i Hind-i Garbi&quot;, 1730
# &quot;Tarih-i Timur Gürgan&quot;, 1730
# &quot;Tarih-I Mısr-i Kadim ve Mısr-i Cedid&quot;, 1730
# &quot;Gülşen-i Hülefa&quot;, 1730
# &quot;Grammaire Turque&quot;, 1730
# &quot;Usul el-Hikem fi Nizam el-Ümem&quot;, 1732
# &quot;Fiyuzat-ı Mıknatısiye&quot;, 1732
# &quot;Cihan-nüma&quot;, 1732
# &quot;Takvim el-Tevarih&quot;, 1733
# &quot;Kitab-ı Tarih-i Naima&quot;, 2 volumes, 1734
# &quot;Tarih-i Raşid&quot;, 3 volumes, 1735
# &quot;Tarih-i Çelebizade&quot;, 1741
# &quot;Ahval-i Gazavat der Diyar-ı Bosna&quot;, 1741
# &quot;Kitab-ı Lisan el-Acem el Müsemma bi-Ferheng-i Şuuri&quot;, 2 volumes, 1742

(Most of the copies of the book &quot;Tarih-i Çelebizade&quot; have been bound into the third and last volume of &quot;Tarih-i Raşid&quot; and sold together with it and thus have erroneously led several sources to believe a total of 16 items have been published.)

<doc id="619267" wikidata="Q4998947" url="?curid=619267" title="Burke Marshall">
<text>Burke Marshall (October 1, 1922 – June 2, 2003) was an American lawyer who served as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division during the Civil Rights Movement.

==Early life==
Marshall was born in Plainfield, New Jersey. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, graduating in 1940, and received a BA from Yale University in 1943. He joined the army, working in the intelligence corps as a Japanese translator and cryptoanalyst. It was during his military service that he met Violet Person, whom he later married.

After World War II, Marshall returned to Yale Law School, earning his LL.D. in 1951; he was admitted to the Washington, D.C., bar the same year, joining the Washington-based law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in 1952, where he worked for ten years, specializing in antitrust law for clients such as Standard Oil.

==Government career==
Marshall was appointed Assistant Attorney General in 1961 by Robert F. Kennedy, who was Attorney General in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration. Despite Marshall&#x27;s lack of civil rights experience, he was put in charge of the Civil Rights Division, as Robert Kennedy had already decided not to appoint a known rights leader.

The relationship between Marshall and Kennedy had a difficult beginning. During their initial meeting, little was said, with Kennedy remarking, &quot;I have nothing in common with that man.&quot; However, as the civil rights movement heated up in the South, events brought them together.

During his time in government, Marshall was a significant contributor to a number of advances in civil rights. In 1961, segregation on interstate travel was banned. The following year, the University of Mississippi was forced to admit James Meredith, a well-qualified black student. Marshall and the Attorney General persuaded President Kennedy to enforce the order using federal troops.

Marshall also ran a campaign to increase voter registration by blacks. Within two years of coming into office, he had launched 42 federal lawsuits against states to reform their electoral legislation.

Marshall&#x27;s focus was on results. He argued to not use the Fourteenth Amendment to overcome discrimination, instead favoring the federal government&#x27;s constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. As that power was reserved to the government, states had few legal options of recourse. Marshall used it as a basis to write the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination in public facilities, in government and in employment.

Marshall&#x27;s reputation was not that of an office-based bureaucrat, but of a hands-on negotiator who dealt with many of the major figures across the civil rights drama, ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. to Alabama Governor George Wallace.

Marshall resigned his office in December 1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote on Marshall&#x27;s formal letter of resignation, &quot;I have never known any person who rendered a better quality of public service.&quot;

==Later career==
After leaving government, Marshall returned to commercial legal practice, briefly rejoining Covington and Burling before becoming a vice president and general counsel at IBM in 1965. He rose to senior vice president in 1969. Despite turning down the offer of a deanship at Yale Law School (YLS) when he resigned as Assistant Attorney General, he became a deputy dean and professor at YLS in 1970.

In 1986, he was named Nicholas deB. Katzenbach Professor of Law, and later professor emeritus. He was also the George W. Crawford Professorial Lecturer in Law. At the Yale Law School, Marshall taught courses in constitutional law, federal jurisdiction, and political and civil rights. Among his most innovative and well-known courses was &quot;The Limits of the Law,&quot; which he co-taught at first with Professor Joseph Goldstein and later with both Professor Goldstein and Aharon Barak, Chief Justice of the Israel Supreme Court. He also co-taught a course on Religion and the Law with Professor Perry Dane at a time when that subject was rarely taught as a course to itself at major law schools.

Marshall was the chair of the Vera Institute of Justice Board of Trustees between 1966 and 1986. He also chaired the Center for Employment Opportunities in 1996. In 1999, he received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights.

==Death==
Marshall died June 2, 2003, aged 80, at his home in Newtown, Connecticut, of complications of myelodysplasia, a bone marrow disorder.

He was survived by his wife Violet P. Marshall, three daughters, Catie Marshall, Jane Marshall, both of Brooklyn, New York, and Josie Phillips of Plymouth, England, as well as four grandchildren: Ian Marshall Bakerman and Morgan Montgomery Bakerman of Catie Marshall and Nelson Bakerman; and James Marshall Phillips and Samuel Burke Phillips, who are the sons of Josie and Greg Phillips.
