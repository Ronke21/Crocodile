<text>The Kingdom of Powys (; ) was a Welsh successor state, petty kingdom and principality that emerged during the Middle Ages following the end of Roman rule in Britain. It very roughly covered the northern two-thirds of the modern county of Powys and part of today&#x27;s English West Midlands (see map). More precisely, and based on the Romano-British tribal lands of the Ordovices in the west and the Cornovii in the east, its boundaries originally extended from the Cambrian Mountains in the west to include the modern West Midlands region of England in the east. The fertile river valleys of the Severn and Tern are found there, and this region is referred to in later Welsh literature as &quot;the Paradise of Powys&quot; (an epithet retained in Welsh for the modern UK county).

==Name==
The name Powys is thought to derive from Latin &quot;pagus&quot; &#x27;the countryside&#x27; and &quot;pagenses&quot; &#x27;dwellers in the countryside&#x27;, also the origins of French &quot;pays&quot; and English &quot;peasant&quot;. During the Roman Empire, this region was organised into a province, with the capital at Viroconium Cornoviorum (modern Wroxeter), the fourth-largest Roman city in Britain. It was later abandoned for Deva Victrix (Chester).

== Early Middle Ages ==

Throughout the Early Middle Ages, Powys was ruled by the Gwertherion dynasty, a family claiming descent jointly from the marriage of Vortigern and Princess Sevira, the daughter of Magnus Maximus. Archaeological evidence has shown that, unusually for the post-Roman period, &quot;Viroconium Cornoviorum&quot; survived as an urban centre well into the 6th century and thus could have been the Powys capital. The &#x27;Pagenses&#x27; may have initially been a peripheral group who took control of the former territory of the Cornovii after the collapse of Roman Rule. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, written around AD 828, records the town as &quot;Caer Guricon&quot;, one of his &quot;28 British Towns&quot; of Roman Britain. In the following centuries, the Powys eastern border was encroached upon by English settlers from the emerging Anglian territory of Mercia. This was a gradual process, and English control in the West Midlands was uncertain until the late 8th century.

In 549, the Plague of Justinian – an outbreak of a strain of bubonic plague – arrived in Britain, and Welsh communities were devastated, with villages and countryside alike depopulated. However, the English were less affected by this plague as they had far fewer trading contacts with the continent at this time. Faced with shrinking manpower and increasing Anglian encroachment, King Brochwel Ysgithrog may have moved the court from Caer Guricon to Pengwern, the exact site of which is unknown but may have been at Shrewsbury, traditionally associated with Pengwern, or the more defensible Din Gwrygon, the hill fort on The Wrekin.

In 616, the armies of King Æthelfrith of Northumbria clashed with Powys. Seeing an opportunity to further drive a wedge between the North Welsh and those of Rheged, Æthelfrith invaded Powys&#x27; northern lands. Æthelfrith forced a battle near Chester and defeated Selyf and his allies. At the commencement of the battle, Bede tells us that the pagan Æthelfrith slaughtered 1,200 monks from the important monastery of Bangor-on-Dee in Maelor because, he said, &quot;they fight against us, because they oppose us by their prayers&quot;. Selyf ap Cynan was also killed in the battle and may have been the first of the kings of Powys to be buried at the church dedicated to St. Tysilio, at Meifod, thence known as the &quot;Eglwys Tysilio&quot; and subsequently the dynasty&#x27;s Royal mausoleum.

If King Cynddylan of Pengwern hailed from the royal Powys dynasty, then forces from Powys may also have been present at the Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. According to the probably ninth-century cycle of &quot;englyn&quot;-poems &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;, the region around Pengwern was sacked soon after, its royal family slaughtered and most of its lands were annexed by Mercia, some by Powys. However, this account is generally now thought to represent ninth-century imaginings of what must have been going on in the seventh, inspired by Powys&#x27;s political situation in the ninth century.

Powys enjoyed a resurgence with successful campaigns against the English in 655, 705–707 and 722, wrote Davies. The court was moved to Mathrafal Castle in the valley of the river Vyrnwy by 717, possibly by King Elisedd ap Gwylog (d.c. 755). Elisedd&#x27;s successes led King Æthelbald of Mercia to build Wat&#x27;s Dyke. This endeavour may have been with Elisedd&#x27;s own agreement, however, for this boundary, extending north from the Severn Valley to the Dee estuary, gave Oswestry (Welsh: &quot;Croesoswallt&quot;) to Powys. King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this consultive initiative when he created a larger earth work, now known as Offa&#x27;s Dyke (Welsh: &quot;Clawdd Offa&quot;). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox&#x27;s study of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, &quot;In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. 

On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.&quot; And for Gwent Offa had the dyke built &quot;on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the river Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.&quot; This new border moved Oswestry back to the English side of the new frontier, and Offa attacked Powys in 760 at Hereford, and again in 778, 784 and 796. Offa&#x27;s Dyke largely remained the frontier between the Welsh and English, though the Welsh would recover by the 12th century the area between the Dee and the River Conwy, known then as the Perfeddwlad or &quot;Midlands&quot;.

== Rhodri, Hywel, and Gruffydd ==

Powys was united with Gwynedd when king Merfyn Frych of the Gwynedd dynasty married princess Nest ferch Cadell, daughter of king Cyngen of Powys, the last representative of the Gwertherion dynasty. With the death of Cyngen in 854 Rhodri Mawr became king of Powys, having inherited Gwynedd the year before. This formed the basis of Gwynedd&#x27;s continued claims of overlordship over Powys for the next 443 years.

Rhodri Mawr (Rhodri the Great) ruled over most of modern Wales until his death in 878. His sons would in turn found dynasties of their own which would loom large in Welsh history, each claiming descent from Rhodri. Merfyn inherited Powys, whilst his brothers, Anarawd ap Rhodri and Cadell, established the Aberffraw dynasty in Gwynedd and the line of Dinefwr respectively.

In 942 Hywel Dda of Deheubarth (Rhodri&#x27;s grandson through his second son, Cadell) seized Gwynedd on the death of his cousin, Idwal Foel. He apparently took Powys from Llywelyn ap Merfyn at the same time and arranged for a dynastic marriage between their children. Hywel had founded Deheubarth in 920 out of his maternal and paternal inheritances and maintained close relations with Æthelstan, King of the Anglo-Saxons, often visiting Æthelstan&#x27;s court. Hywel studied the English legal system and reformed Welsh law in his own realms (later called the &quot;Cyfraith Hywel&quot; or &quot;laws of Hywel&quot;), and when he went on pilgrimage to Rome in 928, he took his collection of laws, which allegedly were blessed by the pope.

Hywel encouraged the use of coinage in Wales, having his monies minted in Chester, a benefit of his relations with England. In 945 Hywel held an assembly in Whitland to codify his law codes, though with the aid of the celebrated cleric Blegywryd. Hwyel&#x27;s works would lead posterity to name him &quot;the good&quot; (), and his reign is recognised as an unusually peaceful one. On his death, Gwynedd reverted to the Aberffraw dynasty, though Powys and Deheubarth were divided between his sons.
Maredudd ab Owain rebuilt the kingdom of his grandfather Hywel Dda. He was king of Deheubarth and Powys by 986, when he seized Gwynedd. Maredudd fought off English encroachment in Powys and increasing Viking raids in Gwynedd. He is recorded to have paid a penny for hostages captured by Vikings, a large sum for his time. With Maredudd&#x27;s death in 999, Powys passed to his son-in-law Llywelyn ap Seisyll, through Maredudd&#x27;s elder daughter Princess Anghared, while Deheubarth was divided between his sons. 

Gwynedd temporarily returned to the Aberffraw line, though the next century would see the abandonment of the senior historic families as increased Viking incursions and incessant warfare led usurpers to overthrow the Aberffraw and Dinefwr houses; they would not recover until the end of the 11th century. Llywelyn&#x27;s son Gruffydd would unite all Wales under his own kingship, displacing his cousins in Deheubarth, even expanding into England and affecting politics there. With Gruffydd&#x27;s death Deheubarth passed through a series of rulers with various claims, but would return to the historic Dinefwr dynasty in 1063 in the person of Maredudd ab Owain ab Edwin.

== House of Mathrafal ==

It is through Princess Anghared (as daughter of Maredudd ab Owain of Deheubarth and Powys), her second husband was Cynfyn ap Gwerstan, that the Mathrafal dynasty was founded. The dynasty takes its name from the historic seat of Mathrafal Castle. Anghared&#x27;s son Bleddyn ap Cynfyn would inherit Powys in 1063 on the death of his maternal half-brother Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Bleddyn (the name means &quot;wolf&quot; in Welsh) secured Gwynedd in 1063 after a battle with the Aberffraw claimant Cynan ap Iago, with Edward the Confessor of England endorsing Bleddyn&#x27;s seizure later that year. Additionally, Bleddyn is recorded as amending the Law Codes of Hywel Dda.

Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his brother Rhiwallon fought alongside the Anglo-Saxons against the Norman Invasion. In 1067 they allied with the Mercian Eadric the Wild in an attack on the Normans at Hereford, then in 1068 with Earl Edwin of Mercia and Earl Morcar of Northumbria in another attack on the Normans. In 1070 he defeated his half-nephews, the sons of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, in the battle of Mechain in their bid to take Gwynedd. Bleddyn ap Cynfyn himself was killed in 1075 while campaigning in Deheubarth against Rhys ab Owain. With Bleddyn&#x27;s death, Powys passed to his sons and grandsons in their turn. Gwynedd passed to his cousin Trehaearn ap Caradog, who was killed in 1081 at the Battle of Mynydd Carn, and would then return to the historic Aberffraw dynasty in the person of Gruffudd ap Cynan. Powys was itself divided among Bleddyn&#x27;s sons Iorwerth, Cadwgan, and Maredudd.

After William the Conqueror secured England, he left the Welsh to his Norman barons to carve out lordships for themselves. Thus the Welsh Marches were formed along the Anglo-Welsh border. By 1086 the Norman Earl Roger de Montgomery of Shrewsbury had built a castle at the Severn ford of Rhydwhiman, named Montgomery Castle after his home in Normandy. After Montgomery other Normans claimed the north Powys&#x27; &quot;cantrefi&quot; of Ial, Cynllaith, Edernion, and Nanheudwy. From here they took Arwstle, Ceri, and Cedwain. Almost the whole of Powys, as much of Wales, was in Norman hands by 1090. The three sons of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn would lead the resistance and their restoration in Powys. By 1096 they had retaken most of Powys, including Montgomery Castle. Roger Montgomery rose in revolt against King William II of England, and his son Robert Belleme had his lands confiscated in 1102.

===Division===
Through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the House of Mathrafal struggled to retain its lands in Powys against Norman Marcher lords and a resurgent Gwynedd. After 1160, when Madog ap Maredudd died and his son and designated heir, Llywelyn ap Madog, was killed, the realm was divided along the River Rhaeadr:
*Cantrefs north of the Rhaeadr were allocated to Madog&#x27;s remaining sons:
**Penllyn was received by Owain Brogyntyn, Prince of Powys, but almost immediately he was forced to become a vassal of neighbouring Gwynedd, and Penllyn fell under Gwynedd&#x27;s yoke. He was the ancestor of the Hughes of Gwerclas and the Jones of Faerdref Uchaf. 
**Maelor and Iâl (Yale) were received by Gruffydd (subsequently &quot;Gruffydd Maelor&quot;), Prince of Powys Fadog, and ancestor of Owain Glyndwr, Prince of Wales, and the Vaughans of Corsygedeol and the Yale family.
**Swydd y Waun (the commotes of Nanheudwy, and Cynllaith) was received by Lord Owain Fychan. 
*Cantrefs south of the Rhaeadr (Cyfeiliog, Ystlyg, and Caereinion) were allocated to Owain, Prince of Powys Wenwynwyn, (subsequently &quot;Owain Cyfeiliog&quot;), the son of Madog&#x27;s deceased brother
*The cantref spanning the Rhaeadr – Mochnant – was received by Prince Iorwerth Goch ap Maredudd, Madog&#x27;s surviving half-brother.

In 1166, Owain Cyfeiliog and Owain Fychan attacked Iorwerth Goch, forcing him out of Mochnant, and dividing the land between them; Owain Cyfeiliog kept Mochnant Uwch Rhaeadr, while Owain Fychan kept Mochnant Is Rhaeadr (which became part of Swydd y Waun). In 1187, Owain Fychan died, and his lands were transferred to Gruffydd. By the end of the century, the resulting realms had become known by the names of the next generation of rulers: 
*Powys Fadog, north of the Rhaeadr, after Madog the son of Gruffydd
*Powys Wenwynwyn, south of the Rhaeadr, after Gwenwynwyn, the son of Owain Cyfeiliog.

===Impact of external hegemons===

Rhys ap Gruffydd, prince of Deheubarth, had tried to change the law to exclude his eldest son, Maelgwn, born out of wedlock, from the succession; traditional Welsh law differed from that in England and Europe, which disinherited illegitimate children. Maelgwn was forced into exile. In 1197, when Rhys died, Gwenwynwyn loaned troops to Maelgwn to help him take the throne of Deheubarth. Loyal vassals of Rhys, like the ruler of Arwystli, had sided with Gruffydd, the eldest son of Rhys to be born in wedlock, so Gwenwynwyn attacked and subjugated Arwystli; Arwystli (at that time including Cedewain) thenceforth became part of Powys Wenwynwyn.

Rhys had been the most powerful of the Welsh princes at the time, but now the princes of Gwynedd sought hegemony, gaining it under Owain Gwynedd, Llywelyn Fawr, and Dafydd ap Llywelyn. Though Powys Fadog largely supported their aspirations, Powys Wenwynwyn was frequently at loggerheads with them, and was the subject of constant attempts at encroachment by the princes of Gwynedd. Gwenwynwyn himself was driven into exile, in England.

Gwynedd was forced by King Henry III to restore Gwenwynwyn&#x27;s son, Gruffydd, to power in Powys Wenwynwyn. Nevertheless, the power of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, prince of Gwynedd, lead both divisions of Powys to acknowledge Llywelyn as Prince of Wales, by 1263. Llywelyn proceeded to cultivate relations with the enemies of King Henry III, particularly the family of Simon de Montfort.

In 1274, Llywelyn married Simon de Montfort&#x27;s daughter, and Gruffydd repudiated his allegiance. Gruffydd was forced into exile in England, but the following year Llywelyn was declared a rebel by King Edward I, who launched a new campaign against Gwynedd in 1276. The success of the campaign resulted in Gruffydd being reinstated. By this time, Gruffydd&#x27;s son, Owain, had chosen to anglicise his name to Owen de la Pole (taking the surname from the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn – Pool).

Following the death of Madog II, in 1269, Powys Fadog was divided among Madog&#x27;s sons. When Madog&#x27;s eldest son died in 1277, Edward appointed Roger Mortimer the guardian of the youngest son, still a child, to prevent Gruffudd Fychan I (Madog&#x27;s eldest surviving son) taking advantage of the child&#x27;s age to steal his lands. However, when the child&#x27;s body was discovered in the River Dee four years later and presumed murdered, Mortimer was allowed to take the lands – the cantref of Swydd y Waun.

In 1282, Llywelyn attacked the Perfeddwlad, in contravention of the Treaty of Aberconwy, resulting in a huge counter-attack by King Edward. The forces of Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn were instrumental in the total defeat of Gwynedd; alongside Roger Lestrange of Ellesmere and Roger Mortimer, Gruffudd&#x27;s forces ambushed Llywelyn and killed him.

==Post-kingdom Powys==
Powys Fadog (except for Mortimer&#x27;s portion) had allied with Gwynedd during Edward&#x27;s 1282 invasion, so in 1283, in the aftermath of King Edward&#x27;s total extinction of Gwynedd, Edward abolished Powys Fadog, granting Gruffudd Fychan&#x27;s lands to John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (also known as the &quot;Earl of Warren&quot;) as the Marcher Lordship of &quot;Bromfield and Yale&quot; (&quot;Yale&quot; being Ial). 

Nevertheless, the Earl argued for Gruffudd Fychan to retain a portion of Powys Fadog, for the sake of dignity or to reduce the risk of revolt; thus a small portion of Mortimer&#x27;s lands (the region around Sycharth – approximately half the former commote of Cynllaith) and a small portion of the Earl&#x27;s (Glyndyfrdwy) were granted to Gruffudd Fychan as a Barony (i.e. remaining ultimately subject to the authority of the Marcher Lords). The Barony survived until the rebellion (in nominal support of King Richard II&#x27;s heir) of Owain Glyndŵr, the great-grandson (or great-great-grandson) of Gruffudd Fychan.

By contrast, Owen de la Pole – having been on the side of the King during the 1282 conflict – was able to strengthen his position in Powys Wenwynwyn. He converted it into a marcher lordship, via surrender and regrant – the Lordship of Powis. This made him a vassal of Edward I, enabling him to rely on English support to keep him in power, while otherwise remaining completely independent (like other Marcher Lords).

The name Powys for this area disappeared (at the latest) with the introduction of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 when its marcher lordships were incorporated into counties. Powys Fadog was joined with the Lordship of Denbigh to form Denbighshire, while Powys Wenwynwyn largely became Montgomeryshire. The lordship of Powis survived as a barony (within Montgomeryshire) – the Baron de la Pole, still held by the same family. In 1551, the Baron of Powis died without legitimate children, leaving the land to his bastard son, Edward; in 1587, Edward sold the land to Sir Edward Herbert, a distant relative, whose son was subsequently made Baron Powis. Herbert&#x27;s son was created Baron Powis, and his descendants were created Marquesses and Earls of Powis, and remain living at Powis Castle.

Powys would not be resurrected as a polity until the boundary changes in 1974 created a new and enlarged county of Powys that merged the counties of Montgomeryshire, Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. However, Brecknockshire had not traditionally been within the bounds of the old kingdom, Radnorshire had not been part of it since the mid-10th century (if it ever had before, rather than just held by family members), and most of what had once been Powys Fadog was placed in the new county of Clwyd.

<doc id="629083" wikidata="Q5471253" url="?curid=629083" title="Fort Greene Park">
<text>Fort Greene Park is a city-owned and -operated park in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The park was originally named after the fort formerly located there, Fort Putnam, itself was named for Rufus Putnam, George Washington&#x27;s chief of engineers in the Revolutionary War. 

Renamed in 1812 for Nathanael Greene, an American Revolutionary War hero, it was redesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, architects of Central Park and Prospect Park, in 1867. Fort Greene Park contains the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument, which includes a crypt designed by Olmsted and Vaux, holding the remains of Patriot prisoners of war who died while being held on British prison ships in Wallabout Bay during the American Revolutionary War.

Across the street from its DeKalb Avenue entrance at Fort Greene Place is Brooklyn Technical High School. To its west is the oldest hospital in Brooklyn, now called the Brooklyn Hospital Center. North are the Walt Whitman Houses, one of the largest housing projects in New York City.

==History==
Fort Greene Park includes part of the high ground where the Continental Army built fortifications prior to the Battle of Long Island, during the early days of the Revolutionary War. The site was chosen and construction supervised by General Nathanael Greene, and it was named Fort Putnam, after Rufus Putnam, George Washington&#x27;s chief engineer. During the War of 1812, when the possibility of a British invasion of New York led to the re-use of the site for defense, the newly-rebuilt fortification was named Fort Greene in General Greene&#x27;s honor.

After the fort&#x27;s military use had waned, poet Walt Whitman, then the editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, strongly advocated for reclaiming the space for use as a public park. The City of Brooklyn had, by 1842, bought property around the fort from the Cowenhoven family, and in 1847 established what was then called Washington Park, Brooklyn&#x27;s second park, after City Park (today&#x27;s Commodore Barry Park).

In 1867, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, designers of Central Park and Prospect Park, prepared a plan for the redesign of the park, the name of which was changed to Fort Greene Park.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, many parts of New York City were destroyed, including several trees in the park and the surrounding Fort Greene area. 

==Fort Greene Park from above==
===Renovation plans, 2017–present===
In February 2017, Parks Without Borders (PWB), the design unit of NYC Parks proposed renovating the park. Public opposition gave rise to the advocacy group, Friends of Fort Greene Park. The Landmarks Preservation Commission took no vote, with one commissioner observing that the plan was &quot;against every historic moment in the design of the park&quot;. The LPC later approved the plan after NYC Parks eliminated a proposed work by the late landscape architect Arthur Edwin Bye. 

Controversy again arose in early 2018 when NYC Parks announced plans to cut down some park trees, and a group of residents successfully sued to force the release of an internal report about the trees, a decision upheld upon appeal. the renovation was in the procurement process.

In January 2020, a New York Supreme Court judge ordered the city to reassess the park renovation plans to raze more than 80 trees, including 58 mature trees in the northwest section nearest the Ingersoll and Walt Whitman houses. The move was lauded by the Atlantic Chapter of the Sierra Club and covered in &quot;Gothamist.&quot; &quot;This decision should awaken the Department to reality,&quot; legal advisor Michael Gruen told the Brooklyn Patch. &quot;Environmental regulation is not enacted to be evaded as if it were merely an annoyance.&quot;
Georgette Poe, a resident of nearby NYCHA housing, celebrated the ruling as a victory for her community. &quot;The City came in, didn&#x27;t ask us what we needed and then didn&#x27;t listen to the neighborhood,&quot; said Poe. &quot;[They] wanted to take our park away, telling us we&#x27;re not welcome anymore.&quot; &quot;It just doesn&#x27;t make sense,&quot; said FFGP member Arija Flowers. &quot;Parks are supposed to be about trees and green spaces, birds and bees. We don&#x27;t need another paved plaza.&quot;

The city filed a notice of appeal in February 2020. State Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley contacted the city&#x27;s law department and asked for a redesign.

==Monuments==

===Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument===
One of Fort Greene Park&#x27;s distinctive features is the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument. During the Revolutionary War, the British kept American prisoners on ships in Wallabout Bay under terrible conditions. Around 11,500 prisoners died from disease and malnutrition. Olmsted and Vaux envisioned a crypt to hold their remains, with an appropriate monument. It was built, and the remains of the prisoners were re-interred there in 1873. A small monument was also built.

Eventually, funds were raised for a larger monument. The architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White won a design competition, and the monument was unveiled in 1908 by President-elect William Howard Taft. It is a high granite Doric column over the crypt. At the top is an eight-ton bronze urn. At night the monument is illuminated by four electric lights set in four granite shafts. Bronze eagles grace each shaft, and two cannons guard the plaza and the Martyrs&#x27; crypt below.

===Bust of Edward Snowden===

In 2015, a bust of the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden was illicitly erected in the park and taken down by park officials the same day. The next day, it was replaced by a projected hologram.

==Events==
The park is host to the annual Fort Greene Park Summer Literary Festival, an event featuring young writers aged 7–18 reading alongside established writers, such as Sonia Sanchez, Amiri Baraka, Gloria Naylor, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Jennifer Egan, the last two being residents of the neighborhood. The Fort Greene Park Conservancy also operates a summer concert series. The Greene Glass Project was started in 2010 to address the then-thousands of shards of broken glass in the park. The organization was hosting annual cleanups in the summer as of 2015.

<doc id="629095" wikidata="Q801547" url="?curid=629095" title="Upminster station">
<text>Upminster is an interchange station serving the town of Upminster in the London Borough of Havering, Greater London. It is on the London, Tilbury and Southend line (LTSR), down the line from London Fenchurch Street; it is the eastern terminus of the District line on the London Underground; and it is the eastern terminus of the Liberty line on the London Overground network. Upminster is the easternmost station on the London Underground network as well as the easternmost National Rail station in London.

The station is managed by c2c, which operates the LTSR main line services. The station was opened in 1885 by the LTSR; its original entrance and structure beside the main line platforms survive from that date. A larger entrance and ticket hall on Station Road was built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1932 and has since been extensively modernised and includes a number of retail units. Today the station is owned by Network Rail. Upminster is located within Travelcard Zone 6.

==History==
The London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) connected the City of London and its terminal station at with the port at Tilbury Dock in 1854, extending out to the seaside town of Southend in 1856. The route to Southend was not direct, taking a considerable diversion in order to serve the docks at Tilbury. Between 1885 and 1888 a new direct route from Barking to Pitsea was constructed, with the station at Upminster opening on 1 May 1885. The next station to the east was East Horndon (now called ) and to the west was Hornchurch.

Branches were opened by the LTSR to in 1892 and in 1893. The Whitechapel and Bow Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through-services of the Metropolitan District Railway to operate on the LTSR line to Upminster. The District Railway converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were lost at Upminster when they were curtailed at East Ham due to the tracks between that station and Upminster not yet having been electrified. The LTSR was purchased by Midland Railway in 1912 and was amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) from 1 January 1923.

The District Railway electric service extended eastward as far as Barking in 1908. Delayed by World War I, an additional pair of electrified tracks were extended by the LMSR and services of the District continued to Upminster in 1932. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line. A new station at Upminster Bridge on the District line became the next station to the west in 1934. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, management of Upminster station passed to British Railways.

The London Overground service at the station was rebranded as the Liberty line from November 2024.

==Design==
The station was greatly expanded in 1932 by the LMSR and the main station building, the two footbridges and the buildings on the remaining platforms were constructed in typical 1930s style. A further platform for services to Romford was a later addition. The primary station building, which gives access to the main Station Road, has been extensively redeveloped in contemporary style and includes three retail units. The original Victorian station structures remaining beside the main-line platform 1 have been refurbished and now include a secondary ticket office and waiting room with an exit to Station Approach and the car-park. The original platforms were linked by a subway which has since been abandoned. Step-free access is available to all platforms with the exception of platform 6, for the Romford branch line.

The station is the location of a London Underground signal box at the eastern end of the platforms and, several hundred yards further east, the modern signal control centre for all main-line operations on the LTSR. Further beyond the station to the east is Upminster Depot, one of the main railway depots for the District line.

===Platforms===

*Platform 1A, a bay platform, is only used during engineering works when c2c to operate a shuttle between Upminster &amp; Grays. It is only accessible by trains arriving from the branch and leaving to the branch.
*Platform 1 for services to Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street.
*Platform 2 for Grays, Southend and Shoeburyness.
*Platforms 3, 4 and 5 are served by the District line.
*Platform 6 is used for shuttle service to/from Romford, operated by London Overground.

==Services==
The typical off-peak Monday to Friday service of trains per hour (tph) is:
*London Underground, District line
**6 tph westbound to Richmond
**6 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*c2c, London, Tilbury and Southend line 
**6 tph westbound to London Fenchurch Street
**4 tph eastbound to Shoeburyness via Basildon (2 tph all stations and 2 tph semi-fast)
**2 tph eastbound to Southend Central via Ockendon
*London Overground, Liberty line
**2 tph westbound to Romford

==Connections==
London Buses routes 248, 346, 370 and school routes 646 and 652 serve the station.

<text>James Oliver Curwood (June 12, 1878 – August 13, 1927) was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. His books were often based on adventures set in the Hudson Bay area, the Yukon or Alaska and ranked among the top-ten best sellers in the United States in the early and mid 1920s, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly.&quot; At least one hundred and eighty motion pictures have been based on or directly inspired by his novels and short stories; one was produced in three versions from 1919 to 1953. At the time of his death, Curwood was the highest paid (per word) author in the world.
He built Curwood Castle as a place to greet guests and as a writing studio in his hometown of Owosso, Michigan. The castle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is now operated by the city as a museum. The city commemorates him with an annual Curwood Festival.

==Biography and career==

Curwood was born in Owosso, Michigan, the youngest of four children. His great-grandmother was Mohawk and this influenced his later books which often feature First Nations characters and storylines. Attending local schools, Curwood left high school before graduation. He passed the entrance exam to the University of Michigan and was allowed to enroll in the English department, where he studied journalism.

After two years, Curwood quit college to become a reporter, moving to Detroit for work. In 1898, he sold his first story while attending the University of Michigan. In 1907 he was hired by the Canadian government to travel to the northern reaches of Canada to write and publish accounts of his travels to encourage tourism, his trips in Canada inspired his wilderness adventure stories. For many years he traveled to the Hudson Bay area, the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year for more inspiration. He wrote and published twenty-eight adventure/nature novels, two collections of short stories, one non-fiction volume (&quot;The Great Lakes&quot;), a volume of introspection (&quot;God&#x27;s Country: The Trail to Happiness&quot;), and an autobiography, (&quot;The Glory of Living&quot;).

By 1922, Curwood had become very wealthy from the success of his writing. After a tour of Europe with his family where he toured old European castles, he came home and built his own, Curwood Castle in Owosso, Michigan. Constructed in the style of an 18th-century French chateau, the castle is set on the Shiawassee River near downtown Owosso. In one of the castles two large turrets, Curwood set up his writing studio. He also owned a lodge on the Ausable River near Roscommon, Michigan that he used as a retreat for rest and relaxation from his rigorous writing career.
Curwood was an avid hunter in his youth; however, as he grew older, he became an advocate of conservation and environmentalism. He was appointed to the Michigan Conservation Commission in 1927. The change in his attitude toward wildlife is expressed in a quote from &quot;The Grizzly King&quot;: &quot;The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live.&quot;

Curwood&#x27;s daughter, Carlotta Curwood Tate, documented in an account in the Curwood Collector that in 1927, while on a fishing trip in Florida, Curwood was bitten or stung through hip waders by something, source unknown. Health problems related to the bite escalated over the next few months as an infection developed. He died in Owosso at the age of 49, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery there in a family plot.

==Literary and film legacy==
Curwood&#x27;s adventure writing followed in the tradition of Jack London. Curwood set many of his works in the wilds of the Great Northwest and often used animals as lead characters (&quot;Kazan&quot;; &quot;Baree, Son of Kazan&quot;, &quot;The Grizzly King,&quot; and &quot;Nomads of the North&quot;). Many of Curwood&#x27;s adventure novels also feature romance as primary or secondary plot consideration. This approach gave his work broad commercial appeal; his novels ranked on many best-seller lists in the early and mid 1920s. One of his most successful books was his 1919 novel, &quot;The River&#x27;s End&quot;. The book sold more than 100,000 copies and was the fourth best-selling title of the year in the United States, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.

Curwood&#x27;s short stories and other pieces were published in various literary and popular magazines throughout his career. His bibliography includes more than 200 such articles, short stories, and serializations. His work was also published in Canada and the United Kingdom. Some of his books were translated into French, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Czech and Polish, and published in those respective countries.

===Adaptations===
Over one hundred and eighty movies have been based on or inspired by Curwood&#x27;s novels and short stories. Curwood&#x27;s story &quot;Wapi the Walrus&quot; was adapted for film three times. The first was as &quot;Back to God&#x27;s Country&quot; (1919), starring Nell Shipman as a brave and adventurous woman in the wilds of the North. Another version by the same title was released in 1927, and again by this title in 1953.

A young John Wayne and Noah Beery Jr. starred in the 1934 film &quot;The Trail Beyond&quot;, based on Curwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wolf Hunters&quot;. Filmmakers produced a film series featuring Kirby Grant as Mountie Corporal Rod Webb, assisted by his dog Chinook; they made a total of ten films.

In the late 20th century, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud adapted Curwood&#x27;s 1916 novel &quot;The Grizzly King&quot; as the film &quot;The Bear&quot; (1988). The film&#x27;s success prompted a revival of interest in Curwood&#x27;s books.

<text>Western Atlas was an oilfield services company formed in 1987 through the merger of Western Geophysical (owned by Litton Industries) and Dresser Atlas. The resulting company was a joint venture of Litton and Dresser Industries until it was spun off as a publicly traded company in 1994.

==Background==
In 1998, Western Atlas was acquired by Baker Hughes. Western Atlas wireline division, Western Atlas Logging Services, became Baker Atlas, one of seven divisions of Baker Hughes. The Western Geophysical division of Western Atlas was joined with Schlumberger geophysical operations, Geco-Prakla, to form WesternGeco in 2000. WesternGeco was initially owned jointly by Baker Hughes and Schlumberger. In 2006 Schlumberger bought Baker Hughes&#x27; interest in WesternGeco.

This company went from Atlas Wireline to Western Atlas then to Baker Atlas.

<doc id="629100" wikidata="Q723574" url="?curid=629100" title="Pierre Fatou">
<text>Pierre Joseph Louis Fatou (28 February 1878 – 9 August 1929) was a French mathematician and astronomer. He is known for major contributions to several branches of analysis. The Fatou lemma and the Fatou set are named after him.

==Biography==
Pierre Fatou&#x27;s parents were Prosper Ernest Fatou (1832-1891) and Louise Eulalie Courbet (1844-1911), both of whom were in the military. Pierre&#x27;s family would have liked for him to enter the military as well, but his health was not sufficiently good for him to pursue a military career.

Fatou entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1898 to study mathematics and graduated in 1901 when he was appointed an intern (&quot;stagiaire&quot;) in the Paris Observatory. Fatou was promoted to assistant astronomer in 1904 and to astronomer (&quot;astronome titulaire&quot;) in 1928. He worked in this observatory until his death.

Fatou was awarded the Becquerel prize in 1918; he was a knight of the Legion of Honour (1923). He was the president of the French mathematical society in 1927.

He was in friendly relations with several contemporary French mathematicians, especially, Maurice René Fréchet and Paul Montel.

In the summer of 1929 Fatou went on holiday to Pornichet, a seaside town to the west of Nantes. He was staying in Le Brise-Lames Villa near the port and it was there at 8 p.m. on Friday 9 August that he died in his room. No cause of death was given on the death certificate but Audin argues that he died as a result of a stomach ulcer that burst. Fatou&#x27;s nephew Robert Fatou wrote:

Fatou&#x27;s funeral was held on 14 August in the church of Saint-Louis, and he was buried in the Carnel Cemetery in Lorient.

== Mathematical work of Fatou ==
Fatou&#x27;s work had very large influence on the development of analysis in the 20th century.

Fatou&#x27;s PhD thesis &quot;Séries trigonométriques et séries de Taylor&quot; was the first application of the Lebesgue integral to concrete problems of analysis, mainly to the study of analytic and harmonic functions in the unit disc. In this work, Fatou studied for the first time the Poisson integral of an arbitrary measure on the unit circle. This work of Fatou is influenced by Henri Lebesgue who invented his integral in 1901.

The Fatou theorem, which says that a bounded analytic function in the unit disc has radial limits almost everywhere on the unit circle was published in 1906 . This theorem was at the origin of a large body of research in 20th-century mathematics under the name of &quot;bounded analytic functions&quot;. See also the Wikipedia article on functions of bounded type.

A number of fundamental results on the analytic continuation of a Taylor series belong to Fatou.

In 1917–1920 Fatou created the area of mathematics which is called holomorphic dynamics . It deals with a global study of iteration of analytic functions. He was the first to introduce and study the set which is called now the Julia set. (The complement of this set is sometimes called the Fatou set). Some of the basic results of holomorphic dynamics were also independently obtained
by Gaston Julia and Samuel Lattes in 1918. Holomorphic dynamics has experienced a strong revival since 1982 because of the new discoveries of Dennis Sullivan, Adrien Douady, John Hubbard and others. In 1926, Fatou pioneered the study of dynamics of transcendental entire functions , a subject which is intensively developing at this time.

As a byproduct of his studies in holomorphic dynamics, Fatou discovered what are now called Fatou–Bieberbach domains . These are proper subregions of the complex space of dimension &quot;n&quot;, which are biholomorphically equivalent to the whole space. (Such regions cannot exist for &quot;n=1&quot;.)

Fatou did important work in celestial mechanics. He was the first to prove rigorously a theorem (conjectured by Gauss) on the averaging of a perturbation produced by a periodic force of short period . This work was continued by Leonid Mandelstam and Nikolay Bogolyubov and his students and developed into a large area of modern applied mathematics. Fatou&#x27;s other research in celestial mechanics includes a study of the movement of a planet in a resisting medium.

<text>Curwood Castle is a small castle, now a museum, located in Owosso, Michigan, built by the author James Oliver Curwood.

==History==
James Curwood was born in Owosso, Michigan on June 12, 1878. He spent much of his early life out of doors, and at a young age left to tour the South on a bicycle. He eventually returned to Michigan, attended the University of Michigan for two years, and went to work as a reporter and later editor at the Detroit Tribune. In 1907, Curwood returned to Owosso to focus on writing, and the next year published his first novel.

In 1923, Curwood built this replica of a Norman chateau along the banks of the Shiawassee River near his mother&#x27;s home in Owosso. Construction on the building began in 1923 and was completed in 1924. Curwood used the Castle as his writing studio and office. Curwood lived with his family on the other side of the river on the corner of Williams and Mulberry Street (Now M-52).

Curwood later became a zealous conservationist and was appointed to the Michigan Conservation Commission in 1926. He died a year later at age 49 on August 13, 1927. In his will, Curwood bestowed the Castle to the City of Owosso. It has served in various roles over the years and is now a museum operated by the city and is open to the public from April through December on Tuesdays through Sundays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The Castle closed for the winter season each year from January 1, through February and reopens for the year sometime in March. Each year, the city of Owosso hosts the Curwood Festival the first full weekend in June. The Curwood Festival is a non-profit organization run by volunteers and one paid staff member, the volunteers created the festival to celebrate the life and works of James Oliver Curwood.

Curwood Castle is closed Mondays, and these holidays, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year&#x27;s Day, The Months of January through February.

==Description==
Curwood Castle is a romantic interpretation of a Norman chateau. It has an irregular plan with spires at three corners. It has a slate-covered gable roof with chimneys, linked at the base, extending from the rear gable facade. The exterior is made of yellow stucco containing decorative, randomly spaced fieldstones Curwood chose himself. The front facade has an entrance, framed with fieldstone, between two spires, covered with a projecting shed roof.

<text>Sir John Milford Rutter (born 24 September 1945) is an English composer, conductor, editor, arranger, and record producer, mainly of choral music.

==Biography==
Born on 24 September 1945 in London, the son of an industrial chemist and his wife, Rutter grew up living over the Globe pub on London&#x27;s Marylebone Road. He was educated at Highgate School, where fellow pupils included John Tavener, Howard Shelley, Brian Chapple and Nicholas Snowman. As a chorister there, Rutter took part in the first (1963) recording of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; under the composer&#x27;s baton. He thence read music at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the choir. Whilst an undergraduate, he had his first compositions published, including the &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Pipe Carol&quot;. He served as director of music at Clare College from 1975 to 1979, and led the choir to international prominence.

In 1981, Rutter founded his own choir, the Cambridge Singers, which he conducts, and with which he has made many recordings of sacred choral repertoire (including his own works), particularly under his own label &quot;Collegium Records&quot;. He resides at Hemingford Abbots in Cambridgeshire, and frequently conducts many choirs and orchestras around the world.

From 1985 to 1992, Rutter suffered severely from myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome), which restricted his output; after 1985, he stopped writing music on commission, as he was unable to guarantee meeting deadlines.

Rutter also works as an arranger and editor. As a young man, he collaborated with Sir David Willcocks on five volumes of the extraordinarily successful &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; anthology series.

He was inducted as a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity in 1985. Rutter is also a Vice-President of the Joyful Company of Singers, President of The Bach Choir, and President of the Association of British Choral Directors (ABCD).

==Compositions==
Rutter&#x27;s compositions are chiefly choral, and include Christmas carols, anthems and extended works such as the &quot;Gloria&quot;, the &quot;Requiem&quot; and the &quot;Magnificat&quot;.

The world premiere of Rutter&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (1985), and of his authoritative edition of Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, took place with the Fox Valley Festival Chorus, in Illinois. In 2002, his setting of Psalm 150, commissioned for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, was performed at the Jubilee thanksgiving service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. Similarly, he was commissioned to write a new anthem, &quot;This is the day&quot;, for the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, performed at Westminster Abbey during the service.

Rutter&#x27;s work is published by Oxford University Press. It has been recorded by many choirs, but he conducts his own recordings principally on his label Collegium Records.

The first two choral items sung at the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in June 2022 were arrangements by Rutter, as were no fewer than six items performed at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

==Influences==
Rutter&#x27;s music is eclectic, showing the influences of the French and English choral traditions of the early twentieth century as well as of light music and American classic songwriting. Almost every choral anthem and hymn that he writes has a subsequent orchestral accompaniment in addition to the standard piano/organ accompaniment, using various different instrumentations such as strings only, strings and woodwinds or full orchestra with brass and percussion. Many of his works have also been arranged for concert band with optional chorus.

Despite composing and conducting much religious music, Rutter told the US television programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2003 that he was not a particularly religious man, yet still deeply spiritual and inspired by the spirituality of sacred verses and prayers. The main topics considered in the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; programme, which was broadcast a week before Christmas 2003, were Rutter&#x27;s popularity with choral groups in the United States, Britain, and other parts of the world, and his composition &quot;Mass of the Children&quot; (written after the sudden death of his son Christopher while a student at Clare College, Cambridge, where Rutter himself had studied).

In a 2009 interview, Rutter discussed his understanding of &quot;genius&quot; and its unique ability to transform lives—whether that genius is communicated in the form of music or other media. He likened the purity of music to that of mathematics and connected the two with a reference to the discovery made by the early Greeks that frequencies of harmonic pitches are related by whole-number ratios.

==Reception==
Rutter&#x27;s music is very popular, particularly in the UK and US. Many hold him in high regard in the UK, as illustrated by the following quotation from a review in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (25 September 2005): &quot;For the infectiousness of his melodic invention and consummate craftsmanship, Rutter has few peers.&quot; Sue Lawley referred to Rutter as &quot;the most celebrated and successful composer of carols alive today&quot; and Sean Rafferty heralded Rutter as &quot;a creator of not just carols, but wonderfully great things for the human voice.&quot; One British composer, David Arditti, did not regard him as a sufficiently &quot;serious&quot; composer, saying that Rutter is &quot;hard to take seriously, because of the way in which his sheer technical facility or versatility leads to a superficial, unstable crossover style which is neither quite classical nor pop, and which tends towards mawkish sentimentality in his sugarily-harmonised and orchestrated melodies.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that &quot;it is as a writer of carols that he has really made his mark ... His larger-scale works – particularly the &quot;Gloria&quot; (1974), &quot;Requiem&quot; (1985) and &quot;Magnificat&quot; (1990) – are also well established in the choral repertoire.&quot; David Willcocks considered Rutter &quot;the most gifted composer of his generation.&quot;

==Recognition==
In 1980 Rutter was made an honorary fellow of Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey, and in 1988 he became a fellow of the Guild of Church Musicians. In 1996 the Archbishop of Canterbury conferred a Lambeth Doctorate of Music upon him in recognition of his contribution to church music. 

Rutter was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours and knighted in the 2024 Birthday Honours, both for services to music.

In 2008 Rutter also became an honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple while playing a significant role in the 2008 Temple Festival.

In 2023 Rutter became a Fellow of The Ivors Academy. Signified by the presentation of an Ivor Novello Award, Fellowship is also a position within the Academy&#x27;s members and is the highest honour bestowed by the association of music creators.

<doc id="629154" wikidata="Q2633530" url="?curid=629154" title="Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)">
<text>John Corrigan &quot;Jonathan&quot; Wells (September 19, 1942 – September 19, 2024) was an American biologist, theologian, and advocate of the pseudoscientific argument of intelligent design. Wells joined the Unification Church in 1974, and subsequently wrote that the teachings of its founder Sun Myung Moon and his own studies at the Unification Theological Seminary and his prayers convinced him to devote his life to &quot;destroying Darwinism.&quot; 

After gaining a Ph.D. in religious studies from Yale University, Wells became Director of the Unification Church&#x27;s inter-religious outreach organization in New York City. In 1989, he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a second Ph.D. in molecular and cellular biology in 1994. He became a member of several scientific associations and had published in academic journals.

In his book &quot;Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth?&quot; (2000), Wells argued that a number of examples used to illustrate biology textbooks were grossly exaggerated, distorted truth, or were patently false. Wells said that this shows that evolution conflicts with the evidence, and so argued against its teaching in public education. Some reviewers of &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot; have said that Wells misquoted experts cited as sources and took minor issues out of context, basing his argument on a flawed syllogism. Wells&#x27;s views on evolution had been rejected by the scientific community.

==Biography==
Wells was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in New Jersey, and was brought up as a Protestant Christian. He studied geology at Princeton University, where he dropped out in his junior year. Following a brief stint as a taxi driver, he was drafted into the United States Army and spent two years serving in Germany. After his discharge in 1966, he attended University of California, Berkeley, where he publicly refused to report for reserve duty. This resulted in him being arrested and being incarcerated for eighteen months at the Leavenworth military prison. Upon his release, Wells returned to Berkeley where he completed his studies with a major in geology and physics and a minor in biology.

In 1974, Wells joined the Unification Church of the United States. He graduated from the Unification Church&#x27;s Unification Theological Seminary in 1978 with a master&#x27;s degree in religious education. Wells continued his studies at Yale University, earning a PhD in religious studies in 1986, focusing on historical reactions to Darwinism. During this time he wrote extensively on Unification theology and taught at the Unification Theological Seminary. Wells was on the Board of Trustees of the Unification Theological Seminary until resigning in 1997 to return to teaching. He also acted as the director of the International Religious Foundation, a Unification Church affiliated organization which sponsors interdenominational conferences.

Wells had written on the subject of marriage within the Unification Church, and had been called a &quot;Unification Church marriage expert&quot; by church sources. Wells defended Unification Church theology against what he said were unfair criticisms of it made in 1977 by the National Council of Churches.

In 1994, Wells earned another PhD in molecular and cellular biology from the University of California, Berkeley. After receiving his doctorate, he worked at a position he described as &quot;a post-doctoral research biologist at Berkeley, writing articles critical of Darwinism.&quot; Shortly after that Wells joined Phillip E. Johnson, father of the intelligent design movement, at the Discovery Institute. He now serves as a fellow at the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture, the hub of the intelligent design movement, and at the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design, which also promotes intelligent design.

Wells appeared on a panel at Harvard with Stephen Palumbi in November 2001, which his supporters lauded as a &quot;home run&quot;. Other observers stated that Wells&#x27; performance was &quot;uneventful&quot;.

Wells died on September 19, 2024, his 82nd birthday.

==Opposition to Darwinian evolution==
Of his student days at Unification Theological Seminary (1976–78), Wells said, &quot;One of the things that Father [Reverend Sun Myung Moon] advised us to do at UTS was to pray to seek God&#x27;s plan for our lives.&quot; Wells later described that plan: &quot;To defend and articulate Unification theology especially in relation to Darwinian evolution.&quot;

Wells stated that his religious doctoral studies at Yale, which were paid for by the Unification Church, focused on the &quot;root of the conflict between Darwinian evolution and Christian doctrine&quot; and encompassed the whole of Christian theology within a focus of Darwinian controversies. He said:
Wells said that &quot;destroying Darwinism&quot; was his motive for studying Christian theology at Yale and going on to seek his second PhD at Berkeley, studying biology and in particular embryology:
Wells&#x27;s statement and others like it are viewed by the scientific community as evidence that Wells lacks proper scientific objectivity and mischaracterizes evolution by ignoring and misrepresenting the evidence supporting it while pursuing an agenda promoting notions supporting his religious beliefs in its place.

He has written articles for the Discovery Institute, &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot;, &quot;Origins &amp; Design&quot;, and other sympathetic publications attacking evolution and defending intelligent design. In 1997, he presented a paper entitled &quot;Evolution by Design&quot; at the Unification Church sponsored International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences in Washington, D.C.

In 1999, Wells debated with the New Mexicans for Science and Reason. He was one of the contributors to &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2002 debate between intelligent design advocates and evolution supporters. In 2005, he debated Massimo Pigliucci on the PBS talk show &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot;. Pigliucci said that Wells &quot;clearly lied&quot; during his debates and misrepresented his agenda and science, as well as not understanding some of the theories he tried to attack.

Wells is one of the signatories of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,&quot; a petition which the intelligent design movement uses to promote intelligent design by attempting to cast doubt on evolution. He is also the author of &quot;Ten questions to ask your biology teacher about evolution&quot; for high school students, which is published by the Discovery Institute. The National Center for Science Education has issued a list of answers to the questions.

===&quot;Icons of Evolution&quot;===
In 2000 Wells published his book &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot;, in which he discusses 10 examples which he says show that many of the most commonly accepted arguments supporting evolution are invalid. 

There have been 12 detailed reviews of &quot;Icons&quot;, from scholars familiar with the subject matter, which have come to the consensus that the book&#x27;s claims are a politically motivated exaggeration and misrepresentation of a scattering of minor issues. Scholars quoted in the work have accused Wells of purposely misquoting them and misleading readers. Jerry Coyne wrote of &quot;Icons&quot;, &quot;Wells&#x27;s book rests entirely on a flawed syllogism: ... textbooks illustrate evolution with examples; these examples are sometimes presented in incorrect or misleading ways; therefore evolution is a fiction.&quot;

===Kansas evolution hearings===

In 2005, Wells participated in the Kansas evolution hearings, which were boycotted by mainstream scientists. There Wells testified:

Prior to the evolution hearings, in December 2000 after the Pratt County, Kansas, school board revised its tenth-grade biology curriculum at the urging of intelligent design proponents to include material that encourages students to question the theory of evolution, &quot;The Pratt Tribune&quot; published a letter from Jerry Coyne challenging Wells&#x27;s characterization in an article of his work on peppered moths, saying that his article appended to the &quot;Pratt&quot; standards was misused and being mischaracterized:
===&quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design&quot;===
In 2006, Wells published his second major book, &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design&quot;, which was part of a series published by Regnery Publishing. The book was praised by Tom Bethell, author of &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science&quot; (2005), but was described by Reed A. Cartwright of &quot;The Panda&#x27;s Thumb&quot; weblog as being &quot;not only politically incorrect but incorrect in most other ways as well: scientifically, logically, historically, legally, academically, and morally.&quot; Cartwright also edited a chapter-by-chapter critique of the book. A quote from the book linking evolution to eugenics, abortion and racism appeared on Starbucks paper cups in 2007.

== HIV/AIDS denialism ==

In 1991, Wells and his mentor Phillip E. Johnson signed an open letter which said in full:
Wells and Johnson have been criticized, along with others, for their questioning of the scientific and medical consensus that HIV causes AIDS. In the &quot;Washington University Law Review&quot;, Matthew J. Brauer, Barbara Forrest, and Steven G. Gey faulted Wells, Johnson, and others for denying the HIV/AIDS connection and promoting denialism via a petition which did not have any scientific support.

<text>Evelyn Maurine Norton Lincoln (June 25, 1909 – May 11, 1995) was the personal secretary to John F. Kennedy from his election to the United States Senate in 1953 until his 1963 assassination.

== Life ==
Lincoln was born Evelyn Maurine Norton on a farm in Polk County, Nebraska. Her father was John N. Norton, a member of the United States House of Representatives. In 1930, she married Federal worker Harold W. Lincoln, whom she had met as a law student at George Washington University.

Lincoln had always aimed to work on Capitol Hill for a future president, and she achieved this ambition in 1953 by becoming personal secretary to the newly elected senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. She proved suitable for the job, and remained close to the president until his death. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, Lincoln rode in the motorcade a few cars behind Kennedy with his personal physician, George G. Burkley.

Lincoln was reportedly upset that President Lyndon B. Johnson had given her 30 minutes to clear her office for his staff the morning following the assassination. In 1968, she wrote a book, &quot;Kennedy and Johnson,&quot; in which she wrote that President Kennedy had told her that Johnson would be replaced as Vice President of the United States. Lincoln wrote of that November 19, 1963 conversation, just before the assassination of President Kennedy,

 Lincoln went on to write &quot;I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. Now I asked, &#x27;Who is your choice as a running-mate?&#x27; &#x27;He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, &#x27;at this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon.&#x27;&quot;

In October 1994, Lincoln replied to a high school teacher&#x27;s inquiry regarding her thoughts about the assassination stating that she believed Johnson – along with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the Central Intelligence Agency, the mafia, and &quot;Cubans in Florida&quot; – was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.
According to the National Archives, Lincoln gave away or sold many of Kennedy&#x27;s documents and artifacts that she had been entrusted with managing by the Kennedy family after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. In 2005, a legal settlement was reached that enabled the National Archives, the Kennedy Library, and Caroline Kennedy to recover thousands of pages of documents and other items.
Lincoln died at Georgetown University Hospital in 1995, after complications that followed surgery for cancer. Her ashes were placed in a niche at a columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery.

Lincoln was the author of two books:
* &quot;My 12 Years With John F. Kennedy&quot;
* &quot;Kennedy and Johnson&quot;, 1968

<doc id="629176" wikidata="Q909037" url="?curid=629176" title="Fear Factor">
<text>Fear Factor is an American stunt/dare game show that first aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006 and was initially hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan. The show was adapted by Endemol USA from the original Dutch series titled &quot;Now or Neverland&quot;.

For the first five seasons, the contestants consisted regularly of three men and three women pitted against each other in a variety of three stunts for a grand prize, usually $50,000. In the sixth season, the show&#x27;s format was modified to feature four competing teams of two people who have a pre-existing relationship with one another.

&quot;Fear Factor&quot; was cancelled by NBC in 2006 after six seasons (142 episodes excluding specials with highlights); NBC would briefly revive the series for a nine-episode run in 2011. In 2017, MTV revived the series with rapper and actor Ludacris assuming the host role; this incarnation ran two seasons (thirty-three episodes) before being cancelled in 2018. The show has since spawned many spin-offs, creating its own media franchise.

== Series overview ==

==History==
===Original series (2001–2006)===
As NBC&#x27;s answer to the CBS television series &quot;Survivor,&quot; the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001 and built strong ratings and popularity in the following seasons. Joe Rogan, then known for his role on the sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (1995–1999) and as a commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championship, was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with Art Bell, Rogan expected &quot;Fear Factor&quot; to be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections to some of the content and further stated that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career. The series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series&#x27; fourth season (2003–2004), the popularity and ratings began to decline. By the time the series was in its sixth season, the ratings were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings. Later that year, &quot;Fear Factor&quot; faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, Fox&#x27;s talent series &quot;American Idol&quot; on Tuesday nights and the ratings declined even further and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for season six, the series&#x27; ratings continued to drop and consequently, NBC put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom &quot;Joey,&quot; the &quot;Friends&quot; spin-off that was itself removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series&#x27; ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons (&quot;Joey&quot; was cancelled in April) and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. Over its six seasons, &quot;Fear Factor&quot; earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD; in early 2009 a box set release containing the entire series on DVD was planned. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.

===Syndication===
In 2004, &quot;Fear Factor&quot; became the first network reality show to be syndicated. In the fall of that year, NBCUniversal Television Distribution put it into barter syndication and it aired on Fox, The WB and UPN affiliates and on the cable channel FX. However, as of fall 2006, &quot;Fear Factor&quot; had left local syndication due to lack of sales of NBCUniversal and was not renewed for another season next fall since NBC canceled &quot;Fear Factor&quot; after six seasons due to low ratings. In addition to FX, reruns of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; have aired in syndication on Chiller, MTV2 and TBD, with TBD airing a &quot;Fear Factor&quot; marathon the weekend of May 15–16, 2021. The series also has a YouTube channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.

===Revived series (2011–2012)===
With Chiller airing reruns of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; every Sunday night, the ratings led to Comcast informing &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in a May 31, 2011 report that &quot;Fear Factor&quot; would be revived for a seventh season. Eight episodes were ordered, including two two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to hosting duties. The revival was shot in high-definition and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; episodes, TV Guide reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming (NBC eventually lost one episode, the season premiere Hall of Fame Game, because of the lockout that ended in late July). The series revival began airing on December 12, 2011; the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively. This makes the premiere the highest rated non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00 p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan&#x27;s verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement and this is one most commonly used:

The revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions&#x27; six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized four teams of two people each. The stunts remained basically the same, with the &quot;gross&quot; one in between the two physical ones. NBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled &quot;Leeches &amp; Shaved Heads &amp; Tear Gas, Oh My!&quot; which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate. Another episode, entitled &quot;Hee Haw! Hee Haw!&quot; and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012 and &quot;Fear Factor&quot; eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their YouTube channel in July 2014. The sixth episode, entitled &quot;The Bees Are So Angry&quot;, was two hours instead of the usual one and included five teams, five stunts and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, &quot;The Voice&quot; replaced the series&#x27; slot on Monday nights. On May 13, 2012, NBC announced that &quot;Fear Factor&quot; was officially cancelled. NBC rescheduled the two hour &quot;Leeches &amp; Shaved Heads &amp; Tear Gas, Oh My!&quot; episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and 16. The first part ended with the &quot;To Be Continued&quot; subtitle followed by a preview for the second part.

====US Nielsen ratings====
===MTV reboot (2017–2018)===
In April 2017, MTV announced that it would be reviving &quot;Fear Factor&quot; a second time for a 12-episode season. The first season of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Fear Factor&quot; premiered on May 30, 2017, and concluded on August 22, 2017. Just prior to the first-season finale, it was announced that MTV had renewed the series for a second season consisting of 20 episodes. The first half of Season 2, subtitled &quot;Season From Hell,&quot; began airing on February 25, 2018; the second half, subtitled &quot;Celebrity Fear Factor,&quot; premiered on July 17, 2018. The MTV revival was hosted by Ludacris and continued to use the format of four teams competing for a $50,000 prize. The stunts drew inspiration from elements of pop culture, such as horror movies, urban legends and viral videos.

==Show format==

===Original format (2001–2012)===
The show begins with an introduction from the narrator and this is one most commonly used:

Before the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:

The normal format involves three men and three women—or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship—who have to complete three professional stunts to win US$50,000. Rogan noted that the stunts not only test any contestants/teams physically, but mentally as well. Any contestants or teams who were too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt or underperformed a stunt were eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant or team successfully completed the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000 and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants and teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000. This rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts; in those cases, the prize would be carried over to the next stunt. The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, the contestant won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced. There were no instances during the first season where all contestants failed a stunt, so it was never revealed how this would have been handled (however Rogan did state &#x27;as usual&#x27; in an early episode of the second season, when nobody completed the second stunt—even though it was the first time it had happened—that the prize would be reduced by 50%). In the final episode of season one, it was implied by Rogan during the second stunt that involved eating various pig parts that if only one person won the stunt (after only one contestant, Martin Beech, successfully completed the previous stunt), then that person would get the $50,000 prize without the need to complete the final stunt. Only once in the history of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; did the $50,000 prize go unclaimed in an episode; On September 27, 2004, a &quot;Best Friends&quot; edition, none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two Mazda vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see Second stunt). After the acquisition of Universal Studios of Vivendi by NBC&#x27;s parent company General Electric in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of NBCUniversal at Universal Orlando or win trips to Universal Studios in Hollywood.

The order of the stunts on a typical episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; is as follows:

First stunt: The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated. In the sixth season, a sometimes-used rule was that the best-performing team won the ability to eliminate the team of their choice, meaning that teams who failed to complete the stunt or had the worst performance could still advance to the next round if the winning team did not choose to eliminate them.

Second stunt: The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts and retrieval or transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one&#x27;s head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes or worms); retrieval or transfer stunts involve retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. On rare occasions, the &#x27;mental&#x27; challenge would be of a completely different nature, and not be an objectively gross stunt (such as eating undesirable animal parts). Rather, it would be a test of pain endurance, for instance walking barefoot on broken glass or ingesting habanero peppers. Even less often still, the second stunt would be a test of the contestants&#x27; tolerance of (sometimes long-term) public humiliation, such as parading nude down a catwalk in front of an audience of photographers, getting a tattoo, or, in one episode of season 6, receiving a humiliating hair cut, such as a mohawk or &quot;taco&quot; style. At the time of broadcast, many fans commented that the latter stunt was amongst the most unreasonable stunts in the show&#x27;s history.

With the exception of retrieval or transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant or team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants or teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day]. Extremely rarely during the show&#x27;s original run, Rogan would participate in the second stunt, most often as a way of encouraging contestants to take part. However, during a stunt involving tear gas in the third season, the wind changed direction and tear gas blew in the direction of Rogan, the camera crew and the other contestants that were not taking part at that particular moment. On another occasion during the first series, though it was not aired, Rogan ate three sheep eyes exactly like the contestants had to, as it was the first &#x27;gross&#x27; stunt to be taped in the series&#x27; run and he did not feel it fair that the contestants should go at it alone, while he sat cheering them on.

Third stunt: The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an action film. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually $50,000 and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that &quot;evidently, fear is not a factor for you.&quot; Naturally, on the one occasion that the $50,000 prize went unclaimed (the season 5 Best Friends episode), Rogan instead informed the contestants that &quot;evidently, fear &quot;is&quot; a factor for you.&quot; However, Rogan would also do this when nobody completed one of the earlier stunts, even when the stunt in question was not an elimination round.

====Special formats====
=====Four-Stunt Show=====
This was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving body piercing. In seasons 4–6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.

=====Extended competitions=====
Some &quot;Fear Factor&quot; competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which 12 contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (&quot;Psycho Fear Factor&quot; and &quot;Reality Stars Fear Factor&quot;). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.

Tournament of Champions: Seasons 2–3 concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each episode of those respective seasons and a $100,000 grand prize. In season two, the 13 non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with alligators. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In season three, the 24 winners were divided into two groups of 12, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from 12 to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from 12 to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 Mazda RX-8 and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant and the final stunt determined the winner.

Couples Fear Factor: Seasons 4–5 both included &quot;Couples Fear Factor&quot; competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in season 4 and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in season 5. In season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., cars, vacations, pre-loaded credit cards, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. &quot;Couples Fear Factor&quot; episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).

Psycho Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original &quot;Psycho&quot; horror movie from Paramount Pictures. Unlike other &quot;Fear Factor&quot; episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.

Reality Stars Fear Factor: A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. Featured the teams were Jonny Fairplay and Twila Tanner from &quot;Survivor,&quot; Jonathan Baker and Victoria Fuller from &quot;The Amazing Race,&quot; Craig Williams and Tana Goertz from &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; The Miz and Trishelle Cannatella from &quot;The Real World&quot; and Anthony Fedorov and Carmen Rasmusen from &quot;American Idol.&quot; The series was won by The Miz and Cannatella.

=====Other formats=====
Celebrity special (seasons two, three and six):
In seasons 2–3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant&#x27;s charity would receive $50,000 and other contestants&#x27; charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Richardson and Alan Thicke are among the celebrities who have competed on &quot;Fear Factor.&quot; Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by Matt Hardy.

All-Gross Show (seasons 3–6):
All three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved bobbing for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow blood. In seasons 4–5, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a &quot;Farm Fear Factor&quot; episode featured all gross stunts.

Mixed Team and Individual Stunts (seasons two, five and six):
In most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a season 2 episode in which three pairs of twins competed as teams in the first stunt and competed individually in the other two stunts. In season 5&#x27;s &quot;New York vs. L.A.&quot; episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.

Holiday specials (seasons 3–5):
Over the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.

Las Vegas Show (seasons 3–5):
Stunts took place at various hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. The show&#x27;s winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of Blackjack, with the chance to continue gambling if successful.

Special Contestants (seasons 2–7):
Some episodes featured a specific type of contestant (notably models, all-female, twins, military members, reality television stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.

Fear Factor Super Bowl Halftime Show (season 2):
Played in the normal format with &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.

Miss USA (seasons 3–5):
Played in the normal format with Miss USA contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of &quot;Fear Factor,&quot; as NBC produced a Miss USA edition of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on &quot;Minute to Win It.&quot; The Miss USA edition was not present in the show&#x27;s final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.

Blind Date (season 6):
Four single men were introduced to four single women and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.

Sleep Deprivation (season 4):
Five co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the entire series (original or revived) in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.

Million Dollar Heist: (season 6): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to &quot;steal&quot; up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that &quot;stole&quot; the most money&#x27;s worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.

Home Invasion: This short segment was included at the end of each episode in season six. It involved Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants under a time limit (usually one minute) ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from Capital One.

===MTV format (2017–2018)===
MTV&#x27;s &quot;Fear Factor&quot; revival continued to use the format of four teams of two people competing in three challenges for a $50,000 grand prize, as in the last two seasons of the NBC series. As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:

However, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode in first season of the MTV version had three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear and The Final Fear.

Beat the Beast: This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a &quot;FearVantage&quot;, which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).

Face Your Fear: This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.

The Final Fear: This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.

The second season abandoned categorized rounds and FearVantages but continued to follow the general format of the first two rounds consisting of gross stunts and/or small-scale physical stunts, followed by an extreme physical stunt in the final round.

==Controversy==
&quot;Fear Factor&quot; has received criticism from the general public mainly because of the show&#x27;s second stunt, which intends to disgust its viewers. The American Humane Association expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional animal trainers have refused to work on the show because the producers of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; have demanded stunts that violate the association&#x27;s guidelines. In January 2005, an episode featuring a stunt involving blended rats aired in its normal prime time slot. Austin Aitken, a part-time paralegal from Cleveland, sued NBC for US$2.5 million for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his blood pressure rose to the point he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. His disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. Two months later, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of First Amendment protection. &quot;Fear Factor&quot; was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with &quot;electrified wires&quot; complete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing. The Edison Electric Institute issued a warning regarding the episode, fearing that viewers might attempt to climb through a real substation with potentially fatal results. An episode originally scheduled for January 30, 2012, featuring contestants drinking donkey semen and urine was rejected by NBC, which instead aired a rerun. On January 31, 2012, two of the contestants, twin sisters Claire and Brynne Odioso, appeared on &quot;The Cowhead Show&quot; on Tampa Bay radio station WHPT to talk about their experiences in that episode; however, according to TMZ.com, producers of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; warned the Odioso sisters not to continue any discussion of the program, as doing so would put them in breach of their confidentiality agreements.

==Spin-off products and theme park attraction==
&quot;Fear Factor&quot; has also resulted in various spin-off products:
* A game called &quot;Fear Factor: Unleashed&quot; was published by Hip Interactive for the Game Boy Advance.
* A &quot;Fear Factor&quot; board game was published by Master Pieces.
* There were several books based on &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, such as &quot;The Fear Factor Cookbook&quot; and &quot;Fear Factor Mad Libs&quot;.
* Brand New Candy made several novelty candies based on &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, including eyeballs.
* The theme park stunt show attraction Fear Factor Live opened in World Expo at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida, and in Upper Lot at Universal Studios Hollywood in Hollywood, California, in the Spring of 2005. The Hollywood attraction has since been replaced by Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical. The Orlando attraction later closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic and did not return to the park following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.
* Eight champions from &quot;Fear Factor&quot; participated in a special edition of &quot;Weakest Link&quot; that originally aired August 13, 2001. The episode was noteworthy in that only $22,500 was won; this stood as the lowest score on the NBC version of the show.
* A free ad-supported streaming television channel on various fast services sharing the same title as the show that only shows reruns of previously aired episodes from the original and revival NBC series.

<doc id="629179" wikidata="Q3408490" url="?curid=629179" title="Vietnam syndrome">
<text>Vietnam syndrome is a term in U.S. politics that refers to public aversion to American overseas military involvements after the domestic controversy over the Vietnam War. In 1973, the U.S. ended combat operations in Vietnam. Since the early 1980s, some possible effects of Vietnam syndrome include public opinion against war, ending the active use of military conscription, a relative reluctance to deploy ground troops, and &quot;Vietnam paralysis&quot;.

==Failure in Vietnam==
In the domestic debate over the reasons for the US being unable to defeat North Vietnamese forces during the war, conservative thinkers, many of whom were in the US military, argued that the US had sufficient resources but that the war effort had been undermined at home. In an article in &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;Making the World Safe for Communism&quot;, the journalist Norman Podhoretz stated:

Do we lack power?... Certainly not if power is measured in brute terms of economic, technological, and military capacity. By those standards, we are still the most powerful country in the world... The issue boils down in the end, then, to the question of will.

The term &quot;Vietnam syndrome&quot; thereafter proliferated in the press and policy circles as a way of explaining the United States, one of the world&#x27;s superpowers, failing to repel North Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of South Vietnam. Many hawkish conservatives such as Ronald Reagan agreed with Podhoretz. In time, the term &quot;Vietnam syndrome&quot; expanded as a shorthand for the idea that Americans were worried they would never win a war again and that their nation was in utter decline.

In the fall of 1983, President Reagan put his beliefs into action by ordering the invasion of Grenada. A long-simmering internal leadership dispute within the ruling Marxist-Leninist party on the Eastern Caribbean island had suddenly spun out of control, leading to political executions and innocent civilian deaths in the capital city on Oct. 19. Reagan concluded that swift American military action was necessary to protect about 1,000 American residents on the microstate, and also to restore Westminster-style democracy and end growing Soviet Bloc influence over the former British colony. Reagan pushed past the hesitancy of the Pentagon leadership, and the expected domestic and international blowback, to authorize a surprise U.S.-led intervention at dawn on Oct. 25. His presidential directive specifically instructed the Pentagon to take strict secrecy measures to head off any pre-emptive action by the Cubans or the Soviets. &quot;Frankly, there was another reason I wanted secrecy&quot;, Reagan later confided in his autobiography. &quot;It was what I call the &#x27;post-Vietnam syndrome,&#x27; the resistance of so many in Congress to the use of military force abroad for any reason, because of our nation&#x27;s experience in Vietnam... I suspected that if we told the leaders of Congress about the operation, even under terms of the strictest confidentiality, there would be someone who would leak it to the press together with the prediction that Grenada was going to become &#x27;another Vietnam.&#x27;... We didn&#x27;t ask anybody, we just did it.&quot;

==Ronald Reagan&#x27;s speech to Veterans of Foreign Wars==
In the later 1970s and the 1980s, Ronald Reagan talked about the aspects of the Vietnam syndrome but argued that it could be overcome if Americans adopted a more confident and optimistic posture in the world, with him as leader. In the speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), which used the term &quot;Vietnam syndrome&quot;, Reagan alleged that the time was right for such a change of attitude and action since the Soviet Union was outspending the US in the global arms race such that the latter&#x27;s global power was decreasing. He accused the Carter administration of being &quot;totally oblivious&quot; to the Soviet threat.

Asserting a need for a more aggressive and activist foreign policy, Reagan also suggested that Americans could have defeated the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army, alleged that the American public had turned against the war from the influence of North Vietnamese propaganda, and implied that officials had let down the soldiers and had been &quot;afraid to let them win&quot; the war.

Reagan equated the &quot;Vietnam syndrome&quot; with a reluctance on the part of the American public to support US military interventions but also with feelings of guilt about the devastation brought about because of the Vietnam War and with feelings of doubt over the morality of America&#x27;s intentions and actions during the war. Reagan, however, argued that America had fought for &quot;a noble cause&quot; and blamed the war in Vietnam exclusively on North Vietnam&#x27;s aggression:

==Burial of syndrome by military actions==
The Reagan administration hoped that the success of the invasion of Grenada would help dispel the Vietnam syndrome so that the American public could be successfully galvanized to support new US military actions, with President Reagan declaring after the invasion, &quot;Our days of weakness are over. Our military forces are back on their feet and standing tall.&quot;

The quick victory during the Gulf War was widely believed to be the end of the Vietnam syndrome. US President George H. W. Bush triumphantly declared after the war, &quot;The ghosts of Vietnam have been laid to rest beneath the sands of the Arabian desert.&quot;

==Bosnian War==
&quot;Lift and strike&quot; was a proposed policy by the Clinton administration in 1993, which Bill Clinton had supported during his successful presidential campaign in 1992. The policy sought to improve the chances of a political settlement in the bloody atrocity-filled Bosnian War in the former Yugoslavia by lifting the arms embargo, arming the Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), and striking at the Bosnian Serbs if they resisted the rearmament project. A combination of the Vietnam syndrome and very strong opposition from American allies in Europe killed the proposal, which was never enacted.

<text>Nicolas Christopher Henry Browne-Wilkinson, Baron Browne-Wilkinson (30 March 1930 – 25 July 2018) was a British judge who served as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1991 to 2000, and Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1998 to 2000.

== Life and career ==
Browne-Wilkinson was the sixth child and only son of the Rev Canon Arthur Browne-Wilkinson, MC, and of Mary Abraham, daughter of Charles Abraham, Bishop of Derby. He was educated at Lancing and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a First in Jurisprudence in 1952. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1953 and took silk in 1972. He was a judge of the Court of Appeal of Jersey and of Guernsey from 1976 to 1977.

In 1977, Browne-Wilkinson was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Justice and assigned to the Chancery division, receiving the customary knighthood. He was promoted as a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1983, and was of sworn of the Privy Council. From 1985 to 1991 he was Vice-Chancellor, the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Chancery Division.

He was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer as Baron Browne-Wilkinson, &quot;of Camden in the London Borough of Camden&quot; on 1 October 1991, and was Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1998 until his retirement as Law Lord in 2000. His tenure as Senior Law Lord was marred by the controversy surrounding the Pinochet extradition case. He retired from the House of Lords under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 on 1 March 2016.

== Family ==
Browne-Wilkinson married Ursula de Lacy Bacon in 1955; they had three sons and two daughters. After her death in 1987, he married Hilary Warburton in 1990.

<text>Bigfoot is a monster truck. The original Bigfoot began as a 1974 Ford F-250 pickup that was modified by its owner Bob Chandler beginning in 1975. By 1979, the modifications were so extensive, the truck came to be regarded as the first monster truck. Other trucks with the name &quot;Bigfoot&quot; have been introduced in the years since, and it remains a well-known monster truck moniker in the United States.

==Early history==
A former construction worker and off-roading enthusiast from the St. Louis area, Chandler began racing in 1975, using the Chandler family&#x27;s 1974 Ford F-250 four-wheel drive pickup truck and found that automotive shops in the Midwest generally did not carry the parts needed to repair the frequent damage. To remedy this problem, Chandler and his wife Marilyn, along with friend Jim Kramer, opened a shop called Midwest Four Wheel Drive and Performance Center in Ferguson, Missouri. The shop moved to Hazelwood, Missouri, in 1984, which remained as Bigfoot&#x27;s headquarters until 2015 when the headquarters was relocated to Pacific, Missouri.

In 1979, Chandler replaced the under assembly of the truck with one from a military-surplus top loader featuring four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering that used tires. This modification drew attention and Chandler started making appearances at tractor pulls and car shows with his newly christened &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (so named for Chandler&#x27;s heavy-footed racing style which caused frequent breakage of parts) to show off the truck&#x27;s capabilities as well as to promote his shop. The truck&#x27;s growing popularity led to its appearance in the 1981 Gus Trikonis film &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot; (which also features the early monster truck USA-1 credited under a different name).

Chandler&#x27;s next experiment would prove revolutionary. In 1981, Chandler placed two dilapidated cars in a field, so that Chandler could videotape himself crushing the cars with Bigfoot as a joke. When Chandler began playing the video in his shop, a man promoting a motorsports event in Columbia, Missouri, asked him to duplicate the stunt in front of a crowd. After initial hesitation because of the destructive image it would convey, Chandler eventually agreed to perform at the event in April of the following year in what is believed to be the first public car crush. Later that year, a second Bigfoot, built to help meet the steadily rising demand to see the vehicle and sporting tires, received more major media attention by crushing cars at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. In 1983, Bigfoot began receiving sponsorship from Ford Motor Company, a relationship which continued until 2005.

By 1984, many truck owners around the country had taken to imitating Chandler&#x27;s template of outfitting their vehicles with tires standing tall, with some trucks sporting even larger tires. Promoters of truck and tractor pulls, such as SRO Motorsports (later the United States Hot Rod Association) and Golden State Promotions, noticed the exploding popularity of the giant trucks and began booking several to crush cars at their events, with the eventual result being the advent of side-by-side, drag-racing style car crushing events. A popular example of the early days of monster truck racing is portrayed in the 1986 home video release &quot;Return of the Monster Trucks&quot;, which involves a truck pull, car crushing, and mud bogging all in the same course. That event, held in the Louisiana Superdome, was won by Bigfoot, as well as most of the events it was entered into in the mid-1980s. By this point, Chandler had already built an entire fleet of &quot;Bigfoot&quot; trucks to accommodate the vast demand for his vehicle, which remained as the most popular and marketable monster truck despite the large number of imitators. In 1987, Chandler added to his innovations by founding the Monster Truck Racing Association, which remains today as the chief voice in monster truck safety.

Another form of competition Chandler faced was the physical size of the competition. Many truck owners had taken to calling their vehicles the &quot;world&#x27;s largest monster truck&quot;, so Chandler outfitted his &quot;Bigfoot 4&quot; vehicle with tires he had purchased from a junkyard owner in Seattle for $1,000. The tires had been previously used by the US Army in Alaska on their overland train in the 1950s. In 1986, Chandler built a new truck, &quot;Bigfoot 5&quot;, specifically for the tires. Upon its public debut in Indianapolis, Indiana, the truck immediately took the title of the &quot;world&#x27;s tallest, widest, and heaviest monster truck&quot; and was eventually given official recognition of the title by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 2002. With a second set of tires attached, the truck stands tall, measures wide, and weighs over .

==Racing history==
The fledgling all-sports television network ESPN also took note of the popularity of monster trucks in the 1980s and began showing events promoted by the United States Hot Rod Association and TNT Motorsports on a regular basis. With the frequent broadcasts of monster truck races, the next logical step was to create a championship series of monster truck races. TNT began the first recognized series in 1988, and was dominated by Bigfoot for much of the season. However, upstart rookie Rod Litzau, driving the USA-1 truck, gained momentum and passed Bigfoot in the standings going into the last weekend of the season in Louisville, Kentucky. With the way the points system and elimination brackets had been structured, Bigfoot (driven by Rich Hooser) and USA-1 met in the semifinal round with USA-1 clinching the points championship if it beat Bigfoot. USA-1 won the race in spectacular fashion, rolling over in the process, and took the championship. After losing the championship, the Bigfoot team made the decision to shift their focus less on competition and more on research and development in 1989, as well as running frequent events for the USHRA and USA Motorsports and a limited TNT Schedule.

During this time, Chandler began working with computer-aided design (CAD) programs, and using technology he had learned from professional off-road racing, designed a tubular frame for his next Bigfoot truck, along with a nitrogen suspension system sporting of travel. This innovation allowed Bigfoot to possess four times as much suspension travel as those used by nearly all previous monster trucks. Chandler would be awarded a patent for his designs. After testing the vehicle for three months, driver Andy Brass debuted the eighth incarnation of Bigfoot, with the new frame and suspension, in late 1989. It officially made its debut at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana at the Four Wheel and Off Road Jamboree in a special 5,000th show for Bigfoot (where every Bigfoot vehicle gathered in one place for the first time). It made its debut in competition at a USHRA race in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, reaching the final round of competition before rolling over against Jack Willman&#x27;s Taurus.

The following year, after running the USHRA races in Anaheim, California, and Pontiac, Michigan, the truck debuted on the TNT Motorsports Monster Truck Challenge points circuit in Memphis, Tennessee. The Bigfoot 8 chassis was briefly banned from the circuit on April 5, 1990, due to a rule clarification that only allowed leaf, coil, and coil-over suspensions to be run. Although TNT stated that safety was the primary reason for the clarification, they also admitted that another reason was that Bigfoot 8 was simply too technologically advanced and was upsetting the competitive balance of the series. Former BMX racer John Piant, driving Bigfoot 4 raced in place of Bigfoot 8 in multiple events, and Andy Brass drove Bigfoot 4 to victory at the Louisville Motor Speedway. Bigfoot 8 returned to the TNT circuit after the temporary ban had been lifted. Chandler also took legal action against TNT.

Team Bigfoot ended up winning 24 events that season and took the 1990 TNT points championship over Greg Holbrook in Gary Cook&#x27;s Equalizer and Gary Porter&#x27;s Carolina Crusher, the first racing championship for the Bigfoot team. Also that year, Piant took the Special Events Triple Crown Championship, in addition to placing third in the USHRA&#x27;s new point series. After not winning any championships in 1991, Team Bigfoot would go on a 12-year stretch from 1992 to 2003 of winning at least one championship a year, taking a total of 16 series championship victories during that span. 

As of 2019, Team Bigfoot has won a total of 50 series championships.

==Present day==
Bigfoot continues to be in demand. Sponsorships include Firestone, Summit Racing and Vi-Cor. In December 2005, Bigfoot&#x27;s sponsorship with Ford ended, though was not announced officially until 2007.

Bigfoot ceased running events for the Monster Jam series in 1998 due to a dispute over involving licensing of video footage and pictures, and has not returned since. Bigfoot also appeared frequently for USA Motorsports and Motorsports Entertainment Group until those companies were purchased by the USHRA&#x27;s parent company at the time, PACE Motorsports.

Bigfoot still races for the Special Events Promotion Company, Chris Arel Motorsports, Toughest Monster Truck Tour, Monster Nation, Monster X Tour, Checkered Flag Promotions, and many others.

In May 2006, Bigfoot signed former professional wrestler and Monster Jam driver Debrah Miceli. Miceli drove the &quot;Bigfoot 10&quot; chassis until the end of the 2007 Major League of Monster Trucks (MLMT) season. Miceli now drives Madusa for Feld Motorsports.

In July 2010, Bigfoot sponsor Firestone, then a Major League Baseball sponsor, brought Bigfoot to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a show truck. In order to comply with MLB&#x27;s official vehicle sponsorship while being used by Firestone, the Bigfoot 10 chassis featured a Chevrolet Silverado body. In March 2012, Bigfoot formed a partnership with Robby Gordon to promote both his SPEED Energy Drink and his new Stadium Super Trucks racing series. For the partnership, a chassis initially built for Gordon himself was dubbed Bigfoot 19. Despite a promotional picture depicting the body as being a Ford, this truck would also compete with a highly modified Silverado body.

For his innovation of creating monster trucks, Bob Chandler has been inducted into multiple halls of fame. In 2006, he was inducted in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. In November 2011, he was inducted into the International Monster Truck Museum Hall of Fame with its inaugural class. Former driver Jim Kramer was inducted into the second class the following year. Also, in 2013, Chandler was inducted into the Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame.

On November 30, 2018, Bigfoot was announced as one of the participants in the new Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live tour being coproduced by Hot Wheels owner Mattel and the Raycom-Legacy Content Company. This reunites a marketing relationship dating back to the 1980s.

==List of vehicles==
The following is a list of all the vehicles built or owned by Bigfoot 4×4, Inc. Bigfoot #13 was skipped due to superstition regarding the number 13.
===Other vehicles===
==Snake Bite==

&quot;Snake Bite&quot; is an alternate name and appearance sometimes used when a second truck is scheduled to appear at the same event. The first Snake Bite (using Bigfoot 4&#x27;s chassis) was originally driven by Gene Patterson, under the pseudonym of Colt Cobra. He wore a mask to hide his identity and came from the fictional town of Cobra Creek, Colorado. Other Bigfoot trucks and drivers have used the identities over the years.

==Video games==
Bigfoot has been the focus of multiple video games. The first &quot;Bigfoot&quot; video game was released in 1990 by Acclaim Entertainment for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Bigfoot is also the featured truck in the &quot;Monster Truck Madness&quot; series by Microsoft from the 1990s. &quot;&quot; was released on multiple platforms in 2008. &quot;Monster Truck Destruction&quot;, released on iOS and Android platforms in 2012, also features multiple Bigfoot trucks. &quot;Bigfoot Crush&quot; is a 2020 arcade game released by UNIS.

==Film and television appearances==
The original Bigfoot appears in the 1981 film &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;, where it appears as the main character&#x27;s personal truck. This was the first appearance of a monster truck in film. A virtual Bigfoot is used by the character Aech inside the virtual reality universe OASIS in the 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. Other appearances by Bigfoot trucks in film include &quot;Cannonball Run 2&quot;, &quot;Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment&quot;, &quot;Road House&quot;, &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot;, &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;. 

Bigfoot has also been a prominent part of animated TV series. &quot;Bigfoot and the Muscle Machines&quot; was a 1985 animated miniseries produced by Marvel Productions as part of their &quot;Super Sunday&quot; anthology series. A self-aware version of Bigfoot was one of the main characters of the animated series, &quot;The Power Team&quot;; it was included to advertise the NES game. A Discovery Kids TV series called &quot;Bigfoot Presents: Meteor and the Mighty Monster Trucks&quot; was released in 2006.

==Legacy==
Bigfoot was listed by &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine as one of 100 most influential vehicles in the history of hot rodding for its February 2009 issue, it was ranked 69th.

The truck also entered the International Monster Truck Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>Carnosine (&quot;beta&quot;-alanyl--histidine) is a dipeptide molecule, made up of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues. Carnosine was discovered by Russian chemist Vladimir Gulevich.

Carnosine is naturally produced by the body in the liver from beta-alanine and histidine. Like carnitine, carnosine is composed of the root word &quot;carn&quot;, meaning &quot;flesh&quot;, alluding to its prevalence in meat. There are no plant-based sources of carnosine. Carnosine is readily available as a synthetic nutritional supplement.

==Biosynthesis==
Carnosine is synthesized within the body from beta-alanine and histidine. Beta-alanine is a product of pyrimidine catabolism and histidine is an essential amino acid. Since beta-alanine is the limiting substrate, supplementing just beta-alanine effectively increases the intramuscular concentration of carnosine.

==Physiological effects==

=== pH buffer ===
Carnosine has a pKa value of 6.83, making it a good buffer for the pH range of animal muscles. Since beta-alanine is not incorporated into proteins, carnosine can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar). Occurring at 17–25 mmol/kg (dry muscle), carnosine (β-alanyl--histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres.

=== Anti-oxidant ===
Carnosine has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of cell membrane fatty acids during oxidative stress. It also buffers pH in muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It is also a zwitterion, a neutral molecule with a positive and negative end.

===Antiglycating===
Carnosine acts as an antiglycating agent, reducing the rate of formation of advanced glycation end-products (substances that can be a factor in the development or worsening of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney failure, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease), and ultimately reducing development of atherosclerotic plaque build-up.

=== Geroprotective ===
Carnosine is considered as a geroprotector. Carnosine can increase the Hayflick limit in human fibroblasts, as well as appearing to reduce the telomere shortening rate. Carnosine may also slow aging through its anti-glycating properties (chronic glycolyating is speculated to accelerate aging).

=== Other ===
Carnosine can chelate divalent metal ions. It has been suggested that binding Ca2+ may displace protons, thereby providing a link between Ca2+ and H+ buffering. However, there is still controversy as to how much Ca2+ is bound to carnosine under physiological conditions. 

Research has demonstrated a positive association between muscle tissue carnosine concentration and exercise performance. β-Alanine supplementation is thought to increase exercise performance by promoting carnosine production in muscle. Exercise has conversely been found to increase muscle carnosine concentrations, and muscle carnosine content is higher in athletes engaging in anaerobic exercise.

<doc id="629190" wikidata="Q1094104" url="?curid=629190" title="City of Canterbury">
<text>Canterbury (), also known as the City of Canterbury, is a local government district with city status in Kent, England. It is named after its largest settlement, Canterbury, where the council is based. The district also includes the towns of Fordwich, Herne Bay and Whitstable, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Parts of the district lie within the designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty of the Kent Downs.

The neighbouring districts (clockwise from east) are Thanet, Dover, Folkestone and Hythe, Ashford and Swale, all of which are also in Kent. To the north the district has a coast onto the North Sea.

==History==
Canterbury itself was an ancient borough, which had held city status from time immemorial. The earliest known charter was issued by Henry II (reigned 1154–1189). A subsequent charter in 1448 gave the city the right to appoint a mayor. Another in 1461 declared the city to be a county corporate, appointing its own sheriff, making it administratively independent from the surrounding county of Kent. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Canterbury&#x27;s independence was maintained by making it a county borough, independent from the new Kent County Council. Although administratively independent, Canterbury was still deemed part of Kent for the purposes of lieutenancy.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bridge-Blean Rural District
*Canterbury County Borough
*Herne Bay Urban District
*Whitstable Urban District
The Bridge-Blean Rural District entirely surrounded the old city; the urban districts occupied the coastal area to the north. The new district was named Canterbury after its largest settlement. The district is a non-metropolitan district, with Kent County Council providing county-level services to the area. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Canterbury&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1448. Canterbury&#x27;s city status was extended to cover the whole of the new borough.

In 1988 the position of mayor was given the honorific title of lord mayor. The council continues to appoint a ceremonial sheriff; the sheriff no longer has any judicial functions, but the title is today taken by the deputy chair of the council.

==Governance==
Canterbury City Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. The more rural parts of the district are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since April 2023. Following the May 2023 elections a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition formed to run the council, led by Labour councillor Alan Baldock.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of lord mayor in Canterbury is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council (formally the chair of the policy committee prior to 2002). The leaders since 1974 have been:

===Compositions===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2015 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 21 wards with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
Council meetings are held at Canterbury Guildhall at the corner of St Peter&#x27;s Place and St Peter&#x27;s Street, adjoining the Westgate. The building was formerly the Church of the Holy Cross. It had been commissioned by Archbishop Simon Sudbury and was completed before his death in 1381. After the church was declared redundant and deconsecrated in 1972, it was acquired by the city council and converted for municipal use: it was officially re-opened by Prince Charles as the council&#x27;s meeting place on 9 November 1978.

The council&#x27;s main offices are the Council Offices on Military Road, Canterbury, which was built in the 1980s. During 2024 the council plans to vacate Military Road and move its offices to converted parts of the Whitefriars Shopping Centre.

==Geography==
Within the district are the towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable, which, with the rural parishes and the cathedral city itself, make up the district of the City of Canterbury. There are 27 parishes within the district, as follows:

Swalecliffe is an unparished area within the district.

The district is largely rural, with a coastal strip taken up by the almost unbroken spread of seaside towns and beaches from Seasalter, west of Whitstable, to Herne Bay. Between them and the city the hills rise into the wooded area of Blean, south of which the Great Stour flows from its source beyond Ashford.

== Demography ==

==Twin towns==
The district participates in the Sister Cities programme, with 
links
to Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, and Vladimir, Russia.

The Three Towns Association was founded in 1985 on the initiative of three local clergymen to promote person-to-person contact between ordinary people in the UK, the U.S. and Russia. The name was subsequently changed to the Three Cities Association. The Association chose Vladimir as the twin city in Russia because it is the seat of Christianity in that country as Canterbury is the seat of Christianity in England. Vladimir was already twinned with Bloomington-Normal. Among other activities, the Association arranged home-stay exchanges between the two Simon Langton Schools in Canterbury and School No. 23 in Vladimir, where the teaching was conducted in English.

Several towns and villages within the City of Canterbury have their own twinning arrangements: see the articles on Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay.

<doc id="629192" wikidata="Q1579812" url="?curid=629192" title="RAS syndrome">
<text>RAS syndrome, where &quot;RAS&quot; stands for redundant acronym syndrome (making the phrase &quot;RAS syndrome&quot; autological), is the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym in conjunction with the abbreviated form. This means, in effect, repeating one or more words from the acronym. For example: &quot;PIN number&quot; (expanding to personal identification number number) and &quot;ATM machine&quot; (expanding to automated teller machine machine). 

The term &quot;RAS syndrome&quot; was coined in 2001 in a light-hearted column in &quot;New Scientist&quot;.

A person is said to &quot;suffer&quot; from RAS syndrome when they redundantly use one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself. Usage commentators consider such redundant acronyms poor style that is best avoided in writing, especially in a formal context, though they are common in speech. The degree to which there is a need to avoid pleonasms such as redundant acronyms depends on one&#x27;s balance point of prescriptivism (ideas about how language &quot;should&quot; be used) versus descriptivism (the realities of how natural language &quot;is&quot; used). For writing intended to persuade, impress, or avoid criticism, many usage guides advise writers to avoid pleonasm as much as possible, not because such usage is always wrong, but rather because most of one&#x27;s audience may &quot;believe&quot; that it is always wrong.

== Linguistics ==
Although there are many instances in editing where removal of redundancy improves clarity, the pure-logic ideal of &quot;zero&quot; redundancy is seldom maintained in human languages. Bill Bryson says: &quot;Not all repetition is bad. It can be used for effect ..., or for clarity, or in deference to . &#x27;OPEC countries&#x27;, &#x27;SALT talks&#x27; and &#x27;HIV virus&#x27; are all technically redundant because the second word is already contained in the preceding abbreviation, but only the ultra-finicky would deplore them. Similarly, in &#x27;Wipe that smile off your face&#x27; the last two words are tautological—there is no other place a smile could be—but the sentence would not stand without them.&quot;

A limited amount of redundancy can improve the effectiveness of communication, either for the whole readership or at least to offer help to those readers who need it. A phonetic example of that principle is the need for spelling alphabets in radiotelephony. Some instances of RAS syndrome can be viewed as syntactic examples of the principle. The redundancy may help the listener by providing context and decreasing the &quot;alphabet soup quotient&quot; (the overabundance of abbreviations and acronyms) of the communication.

Acronyms from foreign languages are often treated as unanalyzed morphemes when they are not translated. For example, in French, &quot;le protocole IP&quot; (the Internet Protocol protocol) is often used, and in English &quot;please RSVP&quot; (roughly &quot;please respond please&quot;) is very common. This occurs for the same linguistic reasons that cause many toponyms to be tautological. The tautology is not parsed by the mind in most instances of real-world use (in many cases because the foreign word&#x27;s meaning is not known anyway; in others simply because the usage is idiomatic).

== Examples ==
Examples of RAS phrases include:

* DC Comics (&quot;Detective Comics Comics&quot;)
* HIV virus (&quot;human immunodeficiency virus virus&quot;)
* LCD display (&quot;liquid-crystal display display&quot;)
* UPC code (&quot;universal product code code&quot;)

<text>Stefan Mazurkiewicz (25 September 1888 – 19 June 1945) was a Polish mathematician who worked in mathematical analysis, topology, and probability. He was a student of Wacław Sierpiński and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning (&quot;PAU&quot;). His students included Karol Borsuk, Bronisław Knaster, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Stanisław Saks, and Antoni Zygmund. For a time Mazurkiewicz was a professor at the University of Paris; however, he spent most of his career as a professor at the University of Warsaw.
The Hahn–Mazurkiewicz theorem, a basic result on curves prompted by the phenomenon of space-filling curves, is named for Mazurkiewicz and Hans Hahn. His 1935 paper &quot;Sur l&#x27;existence des continus indécomposables&quot; is generally considered the most elegant piece of work in point-set topology.

During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–21), Mazurkiewicz as early as 1919 broke the most common Russian cipher for the Polish General Staff&#x27;s cryptological agency. Thanks to this, orders issued by Soviet commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s staff were known to Polish Army leaders. This contributed substantially, perhaps decisively, to Polish victory at the critical Battle of Warsaw and possibly to Poland&#x27;s survival as an independent country.

<doc id="629204" wikidata="Q168376" url="?curid=629204" title="Vitória, Espírito Santo">
<text>Vitória (; ) is the capital of the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. It is located on a small island within a bay where a number of rivers meet the sea. It was founded in 1551. The city proper is and has a population of 322,869 (2022), whilst the Greater Vitória metropolitan area has a population of more than 1,880,828, the 14th largest in Brazil.

Vitória is a riverine island surrounded by Vitória&#x27;s Bay. In addition to Vitória, the main island, another 34 islands and a mainland portion are part of the municipality, totalling . Originally there were 50 islands, many of which were joined to the largest island by landfill.

In 1998, the United Nations rated Vitória as the fourth best state capital in Brazil to live in, rating cities on health, education, and social improvement projects. Among the Brazilian capitals, Vitória currently maintains the second best human development index (HDI) (after Florianópolis) according to research from the Getulio Vargas Foundation. It was considered the fourth best Brazilian city to live in by the United Nations in 2013, behind São Caetano do Sul, Águas de São Pedro and Florianópolis, and it was ranked as having the highest GDP per capita.

The city has two major ports: the Port of Vitória and the Port of Tubarão. These ports are part of the largest port complex of the country, which are considered the best in quality of Brazil. The city, which lies on the coast, is close to the mountains of Espírito Santo. Through the city&#x27;s port authority, the city council also manages the Trindade and Martim Vaz islands, off the coast, which are important meteorological bases because of their strategic position: located in an area of dispersion of air masses.

== Geography ==
Vitória is a city located on the southeastern coast of Brazil. It belongs to the state of Espírito Santo, with the role of the capital of the state. Its territory extends over 97.12 km2, being one of the smallest cities in the state and the smallest among the 27 Brazilian capitals.

Located in Vitória Bay, it is divided between the mainland and the island of Vitória. The municipality has an outlet, to the east, to the Atlantic Ocean and borders three other municipalities: Serra, to the north, Cariacica to the west, and Vila Velha to the south. Together with them and the municipalities of Fundão, Guarapari and Viana, it forms the Metropolitan Region of Vitória, also called Greater Vitória.

The city of Vitória integrates the domain of the coastal plain. Its substrate is divided between an area of folds and another of sedimentary deposits, which gives it a very rugged relief composed of hills, some of them derived from residual forms, gently undulating terrains and plains. The city is part of the Atlantic Forest, a biome that extends along the eastern coast of Brazil, as well as part of the coastal-marine system. In this way, the plant cover of Espírito Santo is composed of tropical forests, mangroves, sandbanks and dune vegetation.

Two rivers are responsible for supplying the Metropolitan Region of Vitória: Santa Maria da Vitória river and Jucu river. The beaches that make up the coast of the city are the beaches of Camburi, Curva da Jurema and Castanheiras. The municipality of Vitória is composed of 80 neighborhoods, which are divided into nine different administrative regions:

*Centro
*Santo Antônio
*Jucutuquara
*Maruípe
*Praia do Canto
*Continental
*São Pedro
*Jardim Camburi
*Jardim da Penha

===Relief===
The relief of the islands is an extension of the continent, whether granite, surrounded by the sea and native Brazilian restinga-mangue vegetation. The central massif of the island of Vitória, Morro da Fonte Grande, has an altitude of 308.8 m and the main granitic outcrops are Pedra dos Dois Olhos, with 296m, and Morro de São Benedito, with 194m of altitude. Vitória&#x27;s highest point is Pico do Desejado, located in the Trindade Island, with 601m of altitude, eleven hundred kilometers away from the mainland coastline.

===Climate===
The city&#x27;s climate is tropical, with average annual temperature of and the occurrence of rainfall specially in the months from October to January. Temperatures can vary greatly in winter and can reach in times of drought but when cold fronts occur followed by an abnormally cold temperature of the ocean.

The highest absolute maximum temperature ever recorded in the city is (INMET) on February 25, 2006, and the minimum is less than , which resulted from the cold Falklands oceanic current.

Vitória shares the position of the Brazilian capital with the lowest rates of rainfall with Rio de Janeiro at approximately annually. Vitória is also the city that presents the lowest temperature range in practically the whole state of Espírito Santo, as a result both of its oceanic climate and the protection that the mountains afford from major weather changes influenced by air masses.

Vitória is one of the hottest cities in the state of Espírito Santo, due to atmospherical pollution and the large cluster of buildings, in addition to several mountains on the island, which block the south wind, which traditionally occurs on cold days in the state. This causes the minimum of the city being warmer than the average in the state.

Another contributing factor is that the level of rainfall in the city is lesser than Espírito Santo&#x27;s average as a whole, by about . This thermal variation can be easily noticed by comparing the temperatures of Vitória with the nearby town of Vila Velha, noted in all seasons, specially in winter, the minimum of Vila Velha is , lower than in Vitória.

== History ==
Vila Velha, which was the capital of the Captaincy of Espírito Santo, found itself in constant attacks from the Tupi-Guarani-speaking and possibly some Macro-Jê-speaking indigenous peoples and the French and Dutch. The Portuguese then decided to move away the capital and chose an island near the mainland, called by some of the native peoples Guanaani Island. Vila Nova do Espírito Santo, as it was called, was founded on September 8, 1551, and later renamed Vitória in memory of the victory in a great battle led by the holder of the captaincy, Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, against Goytacaz Amerindians.

Until the last century, the limits of the current capital of Espírito Santo were Fort São João, where is currently located the Club de Regatas Saldanha da Gama, near the city center, and the hill where sits the actual Santa Casa de Misericórdia hospital, in Vila Rubim. The city was built on the highlands, which originated several narrow streets. The lowlands were under attack and because of that a number of fortresses were built in the coastline.

On February 24, 1823, the town of Vitória became a city, but its insular isolation prevented its development. From 1894 on, many landfills were implemented in the lower parts of the city with the coffee cycle, changing the shape of the island and urbanising it. Several new neighbourhoods were thus inhabited and public steps built to connect them with the higher ground and ancient houses were demolished. Moreover, sanitation was improved. In 1927, the bridge that connected the island to the mainland was opened and it was followed in 1941 by the first harbour pier.

The port had an important development. Wide avenues were opened over landfills. With these changes, the city became the largest urban space of State of Espírito Santo, a metropolis. In 1970, the Vitória Harbour rose to one of the most important in the country, and the city began its industrialization process. The modernization of the island led to the disappearance of almost all traces of the Colonial and Imperial Brazilian epochs.

==Demographics==


According to the IBGE of 2022, there were 322,869 people residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 45.6% White, 41.6% Pardo (Multiracial), 12.4% Black, 0.2% Asian, and 0.2% Amerindian.

Vitória is the second Brazilian capital with the best quality of life, according to research at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation. This same research institution also claims that Vitória is the 9th best city in Brazil to work in. The capital of Espírito Santo has the highest per capita income among the capitals of Brazil.

== Economy ==
Vitória&#x27;s economy is based on port activities, active trade, industry, and also providing services to tourism. The capital of Espírito Santo has two ports that are the most important of the country: Port of Vitória and the Port of Tubarão. The most important industries are global steelmaker ArcelorMittal Tubarão (formerly CST) and mining company Vale (formerly Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, CVRD).

Vitória&#x27;s GDP corresponds to 20% of the state economy. The tertiary sector encompasses most of the economy of Vitória, reaching 60% of the value of the local economy. This amount does not include local public administration. The calculation covers commerce and services. Industry accounts for 30% of Vitória&#x27;s economy, housing large companies in the extractive sectors, such as Petrobras.

===Trade===

== Transportation ==

=== Airport ===
Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport (Goiabeiras) is located on a land plot of just over 5.2 million square meters. Since construction of its first step, finished in 1946, Vitória Airport has undergone several expansions and modernizations, but current demand has surpassed its capacity of 2.9 million passengers a year. The passenger terminal is air conditioned, with a constructed area of nearly 17,000 square meters, a check-in concourse, 25 check-in counters and boarding and arrival lounges. The recent construction of new aircraft parking boxes on the aprons has improved the airport&#x27;s operational efficiency.

In 2012, more than 3.7 million passengers used the airport, and in 2013 this rose to almost 4 million. Vitória is one of the 32 airports in the Infraero network that has a cargo terminal. In May 1999, the first direct international freight connection started between Vitoria and the United States (Miami) began operating to Vitória, facilitating imports to the state of Espírito Santo. Today there are five such flights a week.

=== Public Transportation ===
Vitoria has two urban transportation systems. 
*The first one, which only works in the city, known by the locals as &quot;verdinhos&quot; because the colors of the bus, the municipal fleet is divided into three bus companies operating 52 conventional lines and 2 selective lines with air conditioning. The passages payment system is electronic ticketing and has service in all districts of the city.
*The Transcol system, linking the capital to other cities of Vitoria, and the lines run along major corridors such as Victoria Av and Beira Mar Av. Some neighborhoods of the city, get out of the axes of the main avenues have specific lines, as Jardim Camburi, which is linked to the Carapina Terminal and Laranjeiras, in the municipality of Serra, through 800 and the Grande Sao Pedro and Grande Santo Antonio line, which are served by lines 518 and 535 and connected to Ibes terminals (Vila Velha) Jardim America (Cariacica), Campo Grande (Cariacica) and Carapina (Serra). It features integration system through bus terminals that are scattered strategic points of the metropolitan area. The state capital, however, no longer has the Transcol system terminals since the closure of the Terminal Don Bosco in 2009.


=== Highways ===
The main access roads are the BR-101, a motorway linking the Brazilian south and northeast with the Metropolitan Region of Greater Vitória, the BR-262 that connects the Central region with Vitória and the Rodovia do Sol (Sun Motorway). Aside from the national highways, the ES-060 runs through the city, which links the local coastal regions.

=== Ports ===
The city has two ports: the Port of Vitória and the Porto do Tubarão.

The Porto de Vitória is the most difficult port for ships to access in all of Brazil. The Bay of Vitória is extremely narrow, with rocks and hills that complicate access by freighters and maritime cruisers to the docks. Ships, cars, and people all compete for space. There are restrictions on traffic, limiting the use of the port. Currently, the port is mostly used by cruise ships and for the repair of ships and oil platforms.

The Port of Tubarão was designed in the 1960s by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce when the Port of Vitória began showing signs of saturation. It offers much easier access to the sea. Since its opening in 1966, its capacity has gradually increased, reaching 80 million tonnes/year in the last decade. Although originally created to export iron ore, in recent years, it has added silos for storing grains and soybean meal. The port is located at one end of Camburi Beach.

=== Railways ===
The Vitória-Minas Railway, which carries cargo from the Central Region, also carries passengers from Vitória to Belo Horizonte.

===Bridge===
The Deputy Darcy Castelo de Mendonça Bridge, also known as the Third Bridge (Portuguese: Terceira Ponte), is the second tallest bridge in Brazil, connecting and reducing the distance between the cities of Vila Velha and Vitória.

== Sports ==
=== Football ===
There are four professional football teams in the city, Rio Branco Atlético Clube, usually known simply as Rio Branco, Vitória Futebol Clube (ES), usually known simply as Vitória (or as Vitória-ES), Espírito Santo Futebol Clube, usually known simply as Espírito Santo, Doze Futebol Clube, usually known simply as Doze, currently playing in Campeonato Capixaba first level.

<text>Nominoe or Nomenoe (; ; 763,  7 March 851) was the first Duke of Brittany from 846 to his death. He is the Breton &quot;pater patriae&quot; and to Breton nationalists he is known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;father of the country&quot;).

==Origins==
He was the second son of Count Erispoe or Erispoë of Poher, King of the Browaroch (775–812), and younger brother of Count Riwallon or Rivallon III of Poher (?–857).

==Rise and titulature under Louis the Pious==
After a general rebellion which had enveloped the entire Carolingian Empire was put down, a general assembly was held at Ingelheim in May 831. It was probably there that the emperor Louis the Pious appointed Nominoe, a Breton, to rule the Bretons (which corresponded to &quot;almost all&quot; of Brittany). Regino of Prüm in his famous &quot;Chronicon&quot; writes, inaccurately for the year 837, that: Nominoe was a staunch ally of Louis the Pious until the emperor&#x27;s death in 840. He supported Louis in the several civil wars of the 830s and he supported the monastery of Redon Abbey, even ordering the monks to pray for Louis in light of the emperor&#x27;s &quot;strife&quot;. Nominoe&#x27;s power base was in the Vannetais and two charters refer to him as Count of Vannes, though it is unknown when that title was held, be it as early as 819 or as late as 834. Nominoe may not have possessed any land outside Vannes and his ability to gather revenue in Breton-speaking territories was probably no greater than any other aristocrat of those regions. His chief source of income after he broke with his overlord was plunder from raids into Frankish territory and from the despoliation of churches. He did have the political authority to exact payment (wergild) in the form of land from a man who had murdered his follower Catworet.

The title Duke of Brittany is primarily a chronicler&#x27;s invention of the tenth century. Nominoe never held a title from the emperor, who refers to him in charters as merely &quot;&quot;, &quot;faithful one&quot;, or as &quot;missus imperatoris&quot;, &quot;imperial emissary&quot;, which was probably the title he was granted at Ingelheim. In Breton charters, Nominoe was known inconsistently by several titles from February 833 until his death:
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, master in Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, possessing Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, governing all Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, prince in Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, reigning in Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Nominoe, duke in Brittany&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;duke Nominoe&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;prince Nominoe&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Breton Nominoe&quot;)

==Loyalty and falling out with Charles the Bald==

The relations between Nominoe and Charles the Bald, Louis&#x27;s successor after 840, were initially amicable. In the midst of a revolt of his men in Neustria, Charles sent from Le Mans to see if Nominoe would submit to him in the spring of 841 and Nominoe agreed to do so. It is clear from the wording of the account of this event in Nithard that Nominoe was too powerful to be compelled to submit; later in 841 he rebuffed the overtures of the new emperor, Lothair I, who claimed Neustria. Nominoe remained loyal to Charles throughout the next year, even making a donation &quot;in alms for the king&quot; to the abbey of Redon on 25 January 842. Breton soldiers, as well as Gascons, certainly took part in the military show of the Oaths of Strasbourg.

In the summer of 843, Lothair or perhaps his supporter Lambert II of Nantes succeeded in persuading Nominoe to abandon Charles and go over to the emperor. Nominoe was thereafter a constant enemy of Charles and his authority in Neustria, often acting in concert with Lothair, Lambert, and Pepin II of Aquitaine. Breton troops fought under Lambert in Neustria and when, in June 844, Charles was besieging Toulouse, Nominoe raided into Maine and plundered the territory. In November 843, Charles had marched as far as Rennes to compel Breton submission, but to no effect.

At the synod of Yutz in October 844, presided over by Charles&#x27; uncle Drogo of Metz, the bishops sent orders to Nominoe, Lambert, and Pepin commanding them to renew their fealty to Charles or be prepared to accept military consequences. Lambert and Pepin complied, but Nominoe ignored the Frankish bishops. However, some Bretons had connived against him with Charles and the king tried to enter Brittany in support of the defectors, but without success: he was defeated at the Battle of Ballon just north of Redon across the Vilaine on 22 November 845. It is probable that in the Vannetais Nominoe&#x27;s authority had been weakened after his split with Charles in 843 and Lupus of Ferrières reports &quot;unrest&quot; in Brittany during this period.

In 844 and 847 according to the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, Nominoe made war on the Vikings.

==Renewed loyalty and second rebellion==
In Summer 846, Charles marched on Brittany and again took no military action, instead coming to peace with Nominoe and exchanging oaths. The details of the peace arrangements are unknown, but Prudentius of Troyes uses the title &quot;duke&quot; (&quot;dux&quot;) for the first time in this context and this may indicate that Nominoe was created Duke of the Bretons in return for recognising Charles&#x27; lordship. As another part of the agreement, Nominoe had Charles remove Lambert from Nantes and put him in power in Sens further away.

By Christmas time, Nominoe&#x27;s Bretons were raiding Neustria, this time near Bayeux, again. This was probably instigated by Lothair, for he, Charles, and their brother Louis the German met at Meerssen in February 847 and agreed to send orders to Nominoe and Pepin II to desist from making war on Charles. Nominoe, probably being paid by Lothair, did not in fact desist; neither did Pepin. In two campaigns in the spring and then fall of 849, Charles was in Aquitaine and Nominoe took the opportunity to raid Neustria. Charles reestablished Lambert in Nantes after Nominoe invaded Anjou. 

In 850, Lambert (and his brother Warnar) had renewed their friendship with Nominoe and together were raiding Maine &quot;with unspeakable fury&quot; according to the &quot;Chronicon Fontanellense&quot;. In August, Charles marched on Rennes, again avoided fighting, and installed garrisons there and at Nantes. Immediately after he left, Lambert and Nominoe defeated the garrisons and captured the new Count of Nantes, Amalric. On 7 March 851, Nominoe died near Vendôme while ravaging the Nantais and Anjou; he was buried at Redon Abbey. By his wife Argentaela, Nominoe left a son named Erispoe, who succeeded him. Nominoe was thus the founder of a political tradition in Brittany which had not thitherto existed; though his charters did not mimic Carolingian ones, his successors would imitate the legitimising Carolingian language in theirs.

==Deposition of the bishops==
In 849 at a place called Coitlouh, Nominoe held a synod whereat he deposed the five Breton bishops of Alet, Saint-Pol, Vannes, Quimper, and Dol. The charges he levelled against them are unknown. Pope Leo IV sent a letter to Nominoe and the bishops (whether before or after the deposition is unknown) informing him that the depositions could only be enacted by a panel of twelve bishops with seventy-two witnesses. The later popes Benedict II and Nicholas I believed that Nominoe had forced the bishops to admit to crimes they had not committed and that their depositions were thus invalid. A Frankish synod of 850 held at either Angers or Tours accused Nominoe of simony by unlawfully removing bishops and replacing them with &quot;mercenarii&quot; (mercenaries of his own). These &quot;mercenarii&quot; were excommunicated, as indicated by an epistle of the synod of Savonnières in 859 sent to what remained of the Breton church in communion with the Archdiocese of Tours. Nominoe sacked Rennes and Nantes, replacing the new Frankish bishop of the latter with his own nominee.

Susannus was deposed in Vannes and replaced by Courantgen. Salocon was deposed in Dol, but his replacement is unknown. At Quimper, Felix was replaced by Anaweten and at Saint-Pol, Clutwoion replaced Garnobrius. The two bishops of Alet, first Rethwalatr and then Mahen are very obscure figures. The bishop of Nantes whom Nominoe succeeded in removing for about a year was Actard. His replacement was the obscure Gislard. In the end the synod of Coitlouh and the bringing of the bishoprics of Rennes and Nantes into the Breton fold meant that the church of Brittany was an actively independent ecclesiastic polity from its nominal metropolitan, the Metropolitan of Tours.

==Succession==

At his death Nominoe was succeeded by his son Erispoe. Nominoe was buried at Redon Abbey.

<doc id="629207" wikidata="Q6388708" url="?curid=629207" title="Ken Wiwa">
<text>Kenule &quot;Ken&quot; Bornale Tsaro-Wiwa (born Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr.; 28 November 1968 – 18 October 2016), although he himself chose to use the name Ken Wiwa, was a Nigerian journalist and author. The eldest son of human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, he worked as an adviser to three Nigerian presidents.

==Background==
Wiwa was born in Lagos, Nigeria, the eldest son of human rights activist and author Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was educated in Nigeria before going in 1978, along with his mother and siblings, to live in England where his father believed he would receive the best possible education at that time. Wiwa attended Stancliffe Hall School and Tonbridge School and went on to the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, now part of University College, London. He was editor of the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot;″s periodical New Media Lab, where he developed content for the paper&#x27;s online edition.

==Journalism==
In 1999, Wiwa relocated to Canada, where he was a writer-in-residence at Massey College in the University of Toronto, Saul Rae Fellow at the Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto, a mentor at the Trudeau Foundation in Canada and a columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, where he was twice nominated for National Newspaper Awards for feature writing. 

Wiwa addressed the European Union, Oxford Union and spoke at a number of colleges and universities, including Harvard University, McGill University and the University of Cambridge. He served as a conference rapporteur at a United Nations meeting on cultural diversity. A regular commentator on major news channels including CNN, BBC, Al-Jazeera, he appeared as a guest on the BBC television programmes &quot;HARDTalk&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;. 

In 2005, Wiwa was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader. He was the founding curator of the Abuja Hub for the Globalshapers Programme of the World Economic Forum and also served on the Africa Advisory Council of the Prince of Wales Rainforest Project. He wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in the UK, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;National Geographic&quot;, in the United States. He served as an editor-at-large for &quot;Arise Magazine&quot; and contributed occasional columns for magazines, newspapers and blogs. 

Wiwa produced and narrated television and radio documentaries for the BBC and CBC, and wrote commentaries for National Public Radio.

==&quot;In the Shadow of a Saint&quot;==
His memoir of his father, &quot;In the Shadow of a Saint&quot;, was published in 2000 to overall positive review coverage. Sandra Jordan wrote: &quot;Ken Wiwa does not spare himself in this story. He reveals self-truths he is not proud of. You feel for him. You feel for his father. His elegantly written book is a weave of Nigerian and family history, both turbulent, both tragic, neither without hope. The book is also a song of the Ogoni people, a tribute to their struggle, their endurance. It is, moreover, a story of being trapped in history; the children of heroes find their lives shaped by their parents, as Wiwa discovers when he meets Nkosinathi Biko, son of Steve Biko, Zindzi Mandela, and Aung San Suu Kyi.&quot; 

The book was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;rich and readable&quot;, and by &quot;Africa Confidential&quot; as &quot;an often sad but refreshingly honest book that provides a unique insight into the personal and political life of one of Nigeria&#x27;s most dynamic and controversial figures&quot;, and for the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewer: &quot;Wiwa&#x27;s impassioned and detailed memoir provides a superb overview of the Nigerian political landscape, as well as an excellent behind-the-scenes look at his father.&quot; &quot;In the Shadow of a Saint&quot; won the 2002 Hurston–Wright Nonfiction Award.

==Special assistant==
In 2005, he returned to Nigeria, and the following year former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Wiwa as his special assistant on peace, conflict resolution and reconciliation. He served President Umaru Yar&#x27;Adua as a special assistant on international affairs. Wiwa was also President Goodluck Jonathan&#x27;s senior special assistant on civil society and international media, from 2012.

==Death==
Wiwa died suddenly in London on 18 October 2016, aged 47, after suffering a stroke. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari paid tribute by saying: &quot;Wiwa was an ardent believer in the unity, progress and stability of his community. I urge family, friends and associates to honour his memory by making his dream of an environmentally safe, secured and prosperous Ogoniland a reality.&quot;

<text>Tim Meadows (born February 5, 1961) is an American actor and comedian. He was one of the longest-running cast members on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he appeared for 10 seasons from 1991 to 2000. For his work on &quot;SNL&quot;, he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 1993. He played main character John Glascott on the ABC sitcom &quot;Schooled&quot; for its two-season run after playing the same character in a recurring role for six seasons on &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. Meadows is also known for his role as Principal Duvall in the 2004 teen comedy film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, a role he then reprised in &quot;Mean Girls 2&quot; and in the film&#x27;s 2024 musical adaptation.

==Early life and education==
Meadows is the son of Mardell, a nurse&#x27;s assistant, and Lathon Meadows, a janitor. He attended Pershing High School in Detroit and studied television and radio broadcasting at Wayne State University.

==Career==
Meadows began performing improvisational comedy at the Soup Kitchen Saloon. Meadows&#x27;s start in show business was in Chicago as a member of The Second City comedy troupe, alongside Chris Farley. In Fall 1990, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Lorne Michaels saw Meadows perform at Second City, and brought him into a meeting in New York, without auditioning for the show, where he read a line for a sketch with Steve Martin, Paul Simon, and Ralph Nader, which was for the first Five-Timers Club sketch for the Tom Hanks episode on December 8, 1990, in which Meadows did not appear at all. 

Meadows would instead officially land a spot on &quot;SNL&quot; two months later in Feb. 1991, and went on to become a longtime cast member, appearing on the program until 2000. (Meadows was on the show for 10 seasons; this was the record for the longest tenure on the show until it was surpassed by Darrell Hammond in 2005, whose record was also surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.) Meadows&#x27;s lengthy tenure on the show was used as a gag in four monologues when former cast members Phil Hartman, Mike Myers and Farley returned to the show to host, and when Alec Baldwin hosted for his 12th time.

During his time on &quot;SNL&quot;, Meadows often spoofed famous personalities, including Oprah Winfrey, Erykah Badu, Michael Jackson, and Tiger Woods, and one time was a quick-change artist to pull off an impersonation of both O. J. Simpson and Al Cowlings within the timespan of one &quot;SNL&quot; skit. Some skits had Meadows playing a fictionalized version of himself, such as being a fan of ice hockey on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, stating his dissatisfaction with the 1994 NHL lockout and remarking, &quot;What am I supposed to do about this; watch basketball?&quot; Another sketch as himself was introducing the entire &quot;SNL&quot; cast as their most famous characters, such as Wayne and Garth, or Melanie Hutsell as Jan Brady in a sing-along denouncing the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which ends with Meadows remarking, &quot;This is personal to me...mainly because I don&#x27;t have an &quot;SNL&quot; character to play!&quot; Eventually, he did get an original character with Leon Phelps, &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, a perpetually horny talk-show host who falsely believed himself to be the living definition of what women search for in a man. The character was adapted into a 2000 film, &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, which followed the character&#x27;s attempts to find love and a suitable outlet for his beloved radio program. In 2001, he co-starred in &quot;Three Days&quot;; in 2003, he appeared as Miles McDermott in &quot;The Even Stevens Movie&quot;.

Meadows soon moved on to other projects, including a regular role on the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;The Michael Richards Show&quot; and a supporting role in the 2004 film &quot;The Cookout&quot;. He also guest-starred as a client on the hit NBC comedy &quot;The Office&quot; in the second-season episode &quot;The Client&quot;. He played a high-school principal in &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, a film written by (and co-starring) fellow &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Tina Fey. He also had a part in Handsome Boy Modeling School&#x27;s album &quot;White People&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in a substantial supporting role in &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;.

Meadows has appeared in other feature films, including &quot;Coneheads&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot;, and &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, all of which were based on popular &quot;SNL&quot; characters and had varying degrees of success. He co-starred in the 2006 film &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot; alongside his former &quot;SNL&quot; co-stars Rob Schneider and David Spade. He was also featured in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; (summer 2006), has appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in the recurring role of P.K. Winsome, a conservative pundit and entrepreneur (who made an appearance at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear), and starred in &quot;The Bill Engvall Show&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. He was also a frequent guest on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; as a comic field reporter. On May 31, 2008, Meadows threw out a ceremonial first pitch and conducted the seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley Field during a Chicago Cubs game against the Colorado Rockies.
In 2014, Meadows co-starred alongside Casey Wilson and Ken Marino in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Marry Me&quot;. Dan Bucatinsky and he played &quot;the Kevins&quot;, the gay dads of Annie (played by Wilson), who are both named Kevin. Since 2013, he has appeared in a recurring role on the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, playing Mr. Glascott, the high school&#x27;s parrot-owning guidance counselor. In 2016, he began starring in the FOX live-action/animation hybrid &quot;Son of Zorn&quot; opposite Cheryl Hines and Jason Sudeikis. He also had a recurring role in &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; as Jake Peralta&#x27;s cannibal prison cellmate.

Meadows is featured in season two of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Space Force&quot; starring Steve Carell.

Meadows continues to perform improv in Chicago and Los Angeles, most frequently at venues such as the ImprovOlympic and Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. With Heather Anne Campbell and Miles Stroth, Meadows frequently performed in the improvised sketch show, &quot;Heather, Miles, and Tim&quot; in Los Angeles.

On February 17, 2023, Meadows was announced to reprise his role as Principal Ron Duvall from the first &quot;Mean Girls&quot; film in the stage-to-screen adaptation of the Broadway musical.

==Personal life==
Meadows married Michelle Taylor in 1997, and they had two sons together. They divorced in 2005.

<text>That Man from Rio () is a 1964 French-Italian international co-production adventure film directed by Philippe de Broca and starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Françoise Dorléac. It was the first film to be made by the French subsidiary of United Artists, Les Productions Artistes Associés. The film was a huge success with a total of 4,800,626 admissions in France, becoming the 5th highest earning film of the year.

This fast-moving spoof of James Bond-type films features striking location photography by Edmond Séchan of Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, and Paris. At the 37th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

The film is directly inspired by the comics of Belgian cartoonist Hergé, featuring a number of scenes that are direct retelling of plot points in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. 

==Plot==
As airman Adrien Dufourquet embarks on an 8-day leave in Paris to see his fiancée Agnès, two South American Indians steal an Amazonian statuette from the Musée de l&#x27;Homme and force Professor Catalan, the curator, into their car. Catalan was the companion of Agnès&#x27; father on an expedition into the Amazonian rainforest during which her father died. Catalan believes that the statuette is one of three which hold the secret to an Amazonian treasure. Adrien arrives in time to see the Indians abducting Agnès, the only one who knows the location of her father&#x27;s statuette, and he pursues them to the airport where he steals a ticket and boards the same plane.

Adrien tells the pilot that his fiancée has been abducted, but Agnès has been drugged and does not recognize him. The pilot plans to have Adrien arrested when they reach Rio de Janeiro, but Adrien eludes the police upon arrival. With the help of Sir Winston, a Brazilian bootblack, Adrien rescues Agnès. They retrieve the buried statuette, but the Indians steal it from them.

In a stolen car provided by Sir Winston, Agnès and Adrien drive to Brasília to meet Senhor de Castro, a wealthy industrialist who possesses the third statuette. On the way, they come across the Indians&#x27; car with Catalan slumped inside; after picking him up, they drive on to Brasília.

At a party in their honor, De Castro takes Catalan to his strong room to assure him of the statuette&#x27;s safety, and Catalan, who planned the museum theft, murders him and steals the statuette. By the time Adrien discovers the body, Catalan and the Indians have abducted Agnès again and escaped in a seaplane. Adrien steals a plane and follows.

In a floating jungle cafe run by Lola, the woman who financed Catalan, Adrien learns that Catalan murdered Agnès&#x27; father and that Agnès is being held in a boat. Rushing to the boat, Adrien hangs onto the side as it heads upstream and finally docks. While Catalan goes to the underground location of the treasure, Adrien knocks out all of Catalan&#x27;s accomplices and rescues Agnès. Catalan finds the treasure, but an explosion set off by a nearby Trans-Amazonian Highway construction crew causes him to be buried with it. Adrien and Agnès flee the jungle and arrive in Paris in time for Adrien to catch his train back to his garrison.

==Cast==
* Jean-Paul Belmondo as Pvt. Adrien Dufourquet
* Françoise Dorléac as Agnès Villermosa
* Jean Servais as the Prof. Norbert Catalan
* Adolfo Celi as Mario de Castro
* Simone Renant as Lola
* Roger Dumas as Lebel, Dufourquet&#x27;s buddy
* Daniel Ceccaldi as Police inspector
* Milton Ribeiro as Tupac
* Ubiracy de Oliveira as Sir Winston the shoeshiner
* Sabu do Brasil
* Peter Fernandez
* Annik Malvil as Airplane Hostess

==Production==
The film was a follow-up to &quot;Cartouche&quot;, a popular swashbuckler with Belmondo. It was decided that he should star in a James Bond spoof. Italian financing of the film led to the Italian actor Adolfo Celi, then resident in Brazil, being cast as Mario de Castro.

Jean-Paul Belmondo&#x27;s personal tastes were Tintin comics, sports magazines, and detective novels. He said he preferred &quot;making adventure films like &quot;Rio&quot; to the intellectual movies of Alain Resnais or Alain Robbe-Grillet.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;That Man from Rio&quot; was released in France on 28 February 1964.

==Reception==
===Awards===
The film was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.

===Critical===
In contemporary reviews, the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; reviewed an English-dubbed version; one of its critics noted that the &quot;One may feel that [de Broca]&#x27;s inconsequential wit is better suited to the smaller, more parochial atmosphere of his earlier films, but here he is involved in a big budget production aimed at a huge audience, and perhaps we ought to be grateful that so much of his personal style has survived, even in the carefully dubbed and slightly shortened American version now presented.&quot; The review noted that the film was &quot;beautifully organised&quot; and that &quot;it always keeps the chuckles rising even if they seldom break into real guffaws.&quot; and praised the two leads, specifically Belmondo who &quot;outdid Douglas Fairbanks in agility, Harold Lloyd in cliffhanging, and James Bond in indestructibility&quot;.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; called &quot;That Man from Rio&quot; &quot;a delightful film&quot;.

In a retrospective review, &quot;The Dissolve&quot; gave the film a rating of three and a half stars out of five, noting that &quot;the action moves along at such a rapid clip, there’s little time to worry about how much the plot relies on incredible coincidences&quot;.

&quot;Time Out&quot; selected the movie as #99 for its list of the 100 greatest French films.

=== Influence ===
Film scholar Cédric Pérolini has argued that the film may be seen as a &quot;missing link&quot; between &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic by Hergé and Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. Author Dominique Maricq has stated that &quot;Spielberg even declared having watched it [&quot;That Man from Rio&quot;] nine times! Did he not know that, to construct his scenario, the Frenchman had himself largely drawn from the boxes and bubbles of the Adventures of Tintin series?&quot; All three pieces of media contain a number of very similar scenes and plot points. For example, at one point in &quot;The Man from Rio,&quot; Catalan steals a car while it is being repaired, an event that appears in both &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&quot;

<doc id="629216" wikidata="Q662750" url="?curid=629216" title="Purr">
<text>A purr or whirr is a tonal fluttering sound made by some species of felids, including both larger, wild cats and the domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), as well as two species of genets. It varies in loudness and tone among species and in the same animal. In smaller and domestic cats it is known as a purr, while in larger felids, such as the cheetah, it is called a whirr.

Although true purring is exclusive to felids and viverrids, other animals such as raccoons produce vocalizations that sound similar to true purring. Animals that produce purr-like sounds include mongooses, kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, badgers, rabbits and guinea pigs.

Animals purr for a variety of reasons, including to express happiness or fear, and as a defense mechanism. It has also been shown that cats purr to manage pain and soothe themselves. Purring is a soft buzzing sound, similar to a rolled &#x27;r&#x27; in human speech, with a fundamental frequency of around 25 Hz. This sound occurs with noticeable vibrations on the surface of the body, varies in a rhythmic pattern during breathing and occurs continuously during inhalation and exhalation. The intensity and length of the purr can also vary depending on the level of arousal of the animal.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism by which cats purr is an object of speculation, with different hypotheses proposed. An early idea was that purring is a hemodynamic process where sound is produced as the blood runs through the thorax.

There is a unique &quot;neural oscillator&quot; in the cat&#x27;s brain of uncertain significance. Although the mechanism has not yet been fully explained, recent studies have inferred it could be the result of oscillatory mechanisms in the central nervous system.  Studies have also shown that purring can be caused through electrically stimulating the infundibular region of the cat&#x27;s brain, suggesting central control.

===Vocal folds/laryngeal muscles===
One hypothesis, backed by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation. Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation of air as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong harmonics.

===Degree of hyoid ossification===
No cat can both purr and roar. The subdivision of the Felidae into &quot;purring cats&quot; (Felinae) on one hand and &quot;roaring cats&quot; (Pantherinae) on the other goes back to Owen and was definitively introduced by Pocock, based on whether the hyoid bone of the larynx is incompletely (&quot;roarers&quot;) or completely (&quot;purrers&quot;) ossified. However, Weissengruber et al. argued that the ability of a cat species to purr is not affected by the anatomy of its hyoid.

The &quot;roaring cats&quot; (lion, &quot;Panthera leo&quot;; tiger, &quot;P. tigris&quot;; jaguar, &quot;P. onca&quot;; leopard, &quot;P. pardus&quot;) have an incompletely ossified hyoid, which, according to this hypothesis, enables them to roar but not to purr. However, the snow leopard (&quot;Uncia uncia&quot;, or &quot;P. uncia&quot;), as the fifth felid species with an incompletely ossified hyoid, purrs.

All remaining species of the family Felidae (&quot;purring cats&quot;) have a completely ossified hyoid, which enables them to purr but not to roar. Based on a technical acoustic definition of roaring, the presence of this vocalization type depends on specific characteristics of the vocal folds and an elongated vocal tract, which is rendered possible by an incompletely ossified hyoid.

==Frequency, amplitude, and respiratory variation==
*Domestic cats purr at a frequency of 20 to 30 vibrations per second.
*Eklund, Peters &amp; Duthie, comparing purring in a cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;) and a domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) found that the cheetah purred with an average frequency of 20.87 Hz (egressive phases) and 18.32 Hz (ingressive phases), while the much smaller domestic cat purred with an average frequency of 21.98 Hz (egressive phases) and 23.24 Hz (ingressive phases). 
*Schötz &amp; Eklund studied purring in four domestic cats and found that the fundamental frequency varied between 20.94 and 27.21 Hz for egressive phases and between 23.0 and 26.09 Hz for ingressive phases. Schötz &amp; Eklund also observed considerable variation between the four cats as regards relative amplitude, duration and frequency between egressive and ingressive phases, but that this variation occurred within the same general range.
*In a follow-up study of purring in four adult cheetahs, Eklund, Peters, Weise &amp; Munro found that egressive phases were longer than ingressive phases in all four cheetahs. Likewise, ingressive phases had a lower frequency than egressive phases in all four cheetahs. Mean frequency were between 19.3 Hz and 20.5 Hz in ingressive phases, and between 21.9 Hz and 23.4 Hz in egressive phases. Moreover, the amplitude was louder in the egressive phases in four cheetahs.
*Eklund &amp; Peters compared purring in adult, subadult and juvenile cheetahs and reported that while there was considerable variation across most of the parameters analyzed (amplitude, phase duration, cycles per phase and fundamental frequency) – mainly attributable to degree of relaxation/agitation in the animals resting or playing– previously reported observations that ingressive phases tend to be lower in frequency were largely confirmed. There were no major differences in these parameters as a function of age.

==Purpose==
In domestic cats, many signals that occur when interacting with humans seem to originate from when the animal was dependent on the mother. Cats have been observed to purr for most of their lifespan, starting from when they were young and suckling from their mother. Purring may be a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment when being petted, becoming relaxed or eating. Some purring may be a signal to another animal that the purring cat does not pose a threat.

Cats have been shown to have different types of purrs depending on situations. For example, purring appears to be a way for cats to signal their caretakers for food. This purring has a high-frequency component not present in other purrs. These are called solicitation purrs (when the cat is seeking a result) and non-solicitation purrs, and the two are distinguishable to humans. In a study, 50 humans were subjected to playbacks of purrs recorded in solicitation and non-solicitation situations at the same amplitude. Humans regularly judged the solicitation purrs as less pleasant and more urgent than the non-solicitation purrs. This variety of purring seems to be found more frequently in cats in a one-to-one relationship with a caretaker. Similarities have been drawn between an infant&#x27;s cry and the isolation cry of domestic cats. The high-frequency aspect of the purr may subtly exploit humans&#x27; sensitivity to these cries. Using sensory biases in communication between species provides cats with a productive means of improving the care that they receive.

Cats often purr when distressed or in pain, such as during the three stages of labor. In the first stage, the uterus begins to contract, the cervix relaxes, the water breaks and the cat begins to purr. The female cat (queen) will purr and socialize during the first stage of labor. The purring is thought to be a self-relaxation technique.

<doc id="629218" wikidata="Q3116769" url="?curid=629218" title="Sodium hexametaphosphate">
<text>Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) is a salt of composition . Sodium hexametaphosphate of commerce is typically a mixture of metaphosphates (empirical formula: NaPO3), of which the hexamer is one, and is usually the compound referred to by this name. Such a mixture is more correctly termed sodium polymetaphosphate. They are white solids that dissolve in water.

==Uses==
SHMP is used as a sequestrant and has applications within a wide variety of industries, including as a food additive in which it is used under the E number E452i. Sodium carbonate is sometimes added to SHMP to raise the pH to 8.0–8.6, which produces a number of SHMP products used for water softening and detergents.

A significant use for sodium hexametaphosphate is as a deflocculant in the production of clay-based ceramic particles. It is also used as a dispersing agent to break down clay and other soil types for soil texture assessment.

It is used as an active ingredient in toothpastes as an anti-staining and tartar prevention ingredient.

===Food additive===

As a food additive, SHMP is used as an emulsifier. Artificial maple syrup, canned milk, cheese powders and dips, imitation cheese, whipped topping, packaged egg whites, roast beef, fish fillets, fruit jelly, frozen desserts, salad dressing, herring, breakfast cereal, ice cream, beer, and bottled drinks, among other foods, can contain SHMP.

===Water softener salt===
SHMP is used in Diamond Crystal brand Bright &amp; Soft Salt Pellets for water softeners in a concentration of 0.03%. It is the only additive other than sodium chloride.

==Preparation==
SHMP is prepared by heating monosodium orthophosphate to generate sodium acid pyrophosphate:

Subsequently, the pyrophosphate is heated to give the corresponding sodium hexametaphosphate:

followed by rapid cooling.

==Reactions==
SHMP hydrolyzes in aqueous solution, particularly under acidic conditions and/or heat, to sodium trimetaphosphate and sodium orthophosphate.

== History ==

Sodium hexametaphosphate is the alkali salt of one of the series of polymetaphosphoric acids (acids formed by the polymerization of phosphate groups). Hexametaphosphoric acid was first made in 1825 by the German chemist Johann Frederich Philipp Engelhart (1797-1853). For his doctoral thesis, Engelhart intended to determine whether iron was responsible for the red color of blood. In order to purify his blood samples, Engelhart had found that he could coagulate the blood serum&#x27;s albumin (dissolved proteins) by treating the blood with phosphoric acid. This contradicted the findings of the famous Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who had stated that phosphoric acid did not coagulate water-soluble proteins such as egg white. Berzelius and Engelhart collaborated with the intention of resolving the contradiction; they concluded that Engelhart had produced a new form of phosphoric acid simply by burning phosphorus in air and then dissolving the resulting substance in water. However they did not determine the new acid&#x27;s composition. That analysis was accomplished in 1833 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Graham, who named the sodium salt of the new acid &quot;metaphosphate of soda&quot;. Graham&#x27;s findings were confirmed by the German chemists Justus von Liebig and Theodor Fleitmann. In 1849 Fleitmann coined the name &quot;hexametaphosphoric acid&quot;.

By 1956, chromatographic analysis of hydrolysates of Graham&#x27;s salt (sodium polyphosphate) indicated the presence of cyclic anions containing more than four phosphate groups; these findings were confirmed in 1961. In 1963, the German chemists Erich Thilo and Ulrich Schülke succeeded in preparing sodium hexametaphosphate by heating anhydrous sodium trimetaphosphate.

==Safety==
Sodium phosphates are recognized to have low acute oral toxicity. SHMP concentrations not exceeding 10,000 mg/L or mg/kg are considered protective levels by the EFSA and US FDA. Extreme concentrations of this salt may cause acute side effects from excessive blood serum concentrations of sodium, such as: “irregular pulse, bradycardia, and hypocalcemia.&quot;

<text>The 1989 European Parliament election, was the third European election to be held in the United Kingdom. It was held on 15 June. The electoral system was First-past-the-post voting in England, Scotland and Wales and Single transferable vote in Northern Ireland. The turnout was again the lowest in Europe.

This election saw the best performance ever by the Green Party (UK) (formerly the Ecology Party), collecting over 2 million votes and 15% of the vote share. It had only received 70,853 as the Ecology Party in the previous election. However, because of the first past the post system, the Green Party did not gain a single MEP, while the Scottish National Party received 1 seat with only 3% of the vote share. The Green Party&#x27;s vote total of 2,299,287 remains its best performance in a national election, as does its percentage result of 14.5%.

The election also saw Labour overtake the Conservatives for the first time in any election since October 1974 and the first time ever in a European election, winning 13 more seats.

Two by-elections to the British Parliament also took place on the same day in the Vauxhall and Glasgow Central constituencies - Labour held both seats.

==Results==

===United Kingdom===

*Overall (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) turnout: 36% (EU average: 59%)
*Overall votes cast: 15,896,078

===Great Britain===

<doc id="629220" wikidata="Q224784" url="?curid=629220" title="John K. Samson">
<text>John Kristjan Samson (born 1973) is a Canadian musician from Winnipeg, Manitoba. He is a singer-songwriter and best known as the frontman of the Canadian indie folk/rock band The Weakerthans. He also played bass in the punk band Propagandhi during the mid-1990s. Today, Samson is making music under his own name, John K. Samson. His latest solo album, &quot;Winter Wheat&quot;, was released in 2016.

==Music==
In 1993, while still a member of Propagandhi, Samson released a fifteen-track solo album on cassette tape, entitled &quot;Slips and Tangles&quot;. In 1995, six of these songs were featured on a split album shared with the now-defunct punk band Painted Thin. Following the critical success of The Weakerthans, Samson&#x27;s side of the split was re-released online by G7 Welcoming Committee as a digital EP in 2006.

In 1995, also while still in Propagandhi, Samson released the song &quot;Letter of Resignation&quot; on a split with F.Y.P. Although credited to Propagandhi, Samson was the only band member to appear on the song. He later rerecorded &quot;Letter of Resignation&quot; on The Weakerthans&#x27; debut album, &quot;Fallow&quot;.
In 2006, he and his wife Christine Fellows recorded &quot;The Old House&quot;, an album intended as a Christmas gift for friends and family. They eventually released two songs, &quot;Taps Reversed&quot; and &quot;Good Salvage&quot;, for airplay on CBC Radio 3 in 2007. Fellows and Samson also performed live on the network on March 17, 2007, to mark the final night of the network&#x27;s terrestrial simulcast on CBC Radio 2. Both Samson and Fellows also participated in writing and performing music for Clive Holden&#x27;s multimedia project &quot;Trains of Winnipeg&quot;.

In 2008, Samson collaborated with electronic musician Blunderspublik and Inuit throat singer Nikki Komaksiutiksak on the song &quot;Keewatin Arctic&quot;, as part of the collaborative music project Record of the Week Club.

Shortly afterward, Samson announced his first solo project since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Little Pictures&quot;: a series of 7&quot; releases about Manitoba roads, which he planned to release over the next 18 months. The first, &quot;City Route 85&quot;, was released on November 3, 2009, through Epitaph and ANTI-. In August 2010, Samson announced his next EP, &quot;Provincial Road 222&quot;, to be released on September 21. In December 2010, the Weakerthans performed four concerts in Winnipeg, one for each of their albums. In their final concert at the Burton Cummings Theatre, they performed all four of their albums in one night.

In 2011, Samson, Fellows and Sandro Perri participated in the National Parks Project, working with filmmaker Daniel Cockburn to produce and score a short film about Ontario&#x27;s Bruce Peninsula National Park.

On November 29, 2011, Anti- Records announced that Samson would be releasing his &#x27;first full-length solo album&#x27;, &quot;Provincial&quot;, on January 24, 2012.

He appears on Michael Feuerstack&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Singer Songer&quot;, contributing vocals to the song &quot;Friday Night Guard&quot;.

In 2015, Samson, Fellows, Ashley Au and Jason Tait collaborated on the music for &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot;, a dance performance by Winnipeg&#x27;s Contemporary Dancers troupe inspired by Neil Young&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;On the Beach&quot;.

On August 15, 2016, Samson announced that his second solo album, &quot;Winter Wheat&quot;, would be released on October 21, 2016. While technically a solo album, &quot;Winter Wheat&quot; features contributions by his Weakerthans bandmates Jason Tait and Greg Smith, and much of it was recorded by Weakerthans sound tech Cam Loeppky.

In 2018, Samson recorded a version of Fellows&#x27; &quot;Saturday Night at Utopia Parkway&quot; for a split single with American musician Kevin Devine. In 2019 he collaborated with Safia Nolin on a cover of Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s &quot;Cute Without the E&quot; for her EP &quot;xX3m0 $0ng$ 2 $!nG @L0nG 2Xx&quot;.

In February 2020, Samson wrote and released &quot;Millennium for All&quot;, a song supporting the activist campaign against the new security restrictions at Winnipeg&#x27;s Millennium Library. He followed up in July with the single &quot;Fantasy Baseball at the End of the World&quot;.

In February 2023, Fellows and Samson released &quot;Hold Music&quot;, an album of almost entirely instrumental music except one song with vocals by Samson. The album was credited to Vivat Virtute, the name of Fellows&#x27; online music and crafts store.

==Other activities==

Samson is also a founding member of Arbeiter Ring Publishing, a publishing collective. In 2012 he published his &quot;Lyrics and Poems, 1997-2012&quot; with the press.

In 2006, Samson championed Miriam Toews&#x27; novel &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot; in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s annual &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, and the novel went on to win the competition. In the 2007 edition of Canada Reads—an &quot;all-star&quot; competition pitting the five winning advocates from previous years against each other—Samson returned to champion Heather O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s novel &quot;Lullabies for Little Criminals&quot;, which also won the competition.

In 2008 and 2009, Samson spent several weeks working at the CBC&#x27;s Winnipeg studios as part of the production team for the CBC Radio 2 program &quot;The Signal&quot;.

Samson was a writer in residence at the University of Manitoba in 2013. He has also been adjunct professor with the Creative Writing Program at the University of British Columbia.

Samson and Christine Fellows frequently produce music for Jonathan Goldstein&#x27;s podcast &quot;Heavyweight&quot;.

==Personal life==
Samson is married to Canadian singer-songwriter Christine Fellows. Samson is a Quaker.

<doc id="629223" wikidata="Q6811585" url="?curid=629223" title="Melanthieae">
<text>Melanthieae is a tribe of flowering plants within the family Melanthiaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies in the 21st century have resulted in a large-scale reassignment of many of its species to different genera; in particular the genus &quot;Zigadenus&quot; (deathcamases) has been restricted to a single species, &quot;Zigadenus glaberrimus&quot;. Plants contain alkaloids, making them unpalatable to grazing animals; many are very poisonous to both animals and humans.

==Description==
Like the family as a whole, members of the tribe are &quot;lilioid monocots&quot;, i.e. their flowers superficially resemble those of the genus &quot;Lilium&quot;, with six tepals not differentiated into sepals and petals. As with other lilioid monocots, they were previously included in a broadly defined family Liliaceae. They are found mainly in woodland or alpine habitats in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Central America, and Asia), with one species found in South America. They are perennials, growing from a bulb or rhizome (or both). Plants have relatively long leaves, both at the base of the plant and along the flowering stems; many have off-white flowers, tending towards green or purple.

The tribe has some distinctive features within the family Melanthiaceae, including nectaries on the tepals (whose number and position is a useful identifying character for some genera); the unusual way in which the anthers open (dehisce) to release pollen; and the possession of a particular class of alkaloids (veratrum alkaloids). Because of these alkaloids, all members of the tribe are at least unpalatable to livestock, and some are seriously toxic to both animals and humans. Many species have common names including the words &quot;death camas&quot;, because of their toxicity and their superficial similarity to the unrelated genus &quot;Camassia&quot;, species of which are known as &quot;camas&quot;.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The species making up the tribe Melanthieae have been considered to form a &quot;natural group&quot; for a long time; the name &quot;Melanthieae&quot; was first used by August Grisebach in 1846. Other names which have been used with more or less the same circumscription include Veratreae and Melanthiaceae sensu stricto.

The main genera included in the tribe before the start of the 21st century were &quot;Schoenocaulon&quot;, &quot;Stenanthium&quot;, &quot;Veratrum&quot;, &quot;Melanthium&quot; (often included in &quot;Veratrum&quot;) and &quot;Zigadenus&quot; s.l. The last genus contained about 20 species when broadly defined and lacked very distinctive morphological features. Various genera were constructed between 1837 and 1903 to divide up &quot;Zigadenus&quot;, including &quot;Amianthium&quot; (Gray, 1837), &quot;Anticlea&quot; (Kunth, 1843) and &quot;Toxicoscordion&quot; (Rydberg, 1903). Only the first of these gained broad acceptance in the 20th century (e.g. the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; recognizes only &quot;Amianthium&quot; and &quot;Zigadenus&quot;). A study in 2001 based on both nuclear and plastid gene sequences led to the conclusion that the broadly defined &quot;Zigadenus&quot; was polyphyletic; in particular the genera &quot;Schoenocaulon&quot; and &quot;Veratrum&quot;-&quot;Melanthium&quot; were nested inside it. Monophyletic groups could be produced by splitting &quot;Zigadenus&quot; into five genera (assuming &quot;Amianthium&quot; to have been included): &quot;Amianthium&quot;, &quot;Anticlea&quot;, &quot;Stenanthium&quot;, and &quot;Toxicoscordion&quot;, leaving only &quot;Zigadenus glaberrimus&quot; in &quot;Zigadenus&quot;. Although the reorganization was done primarily on the basis of molecular grounds, it is supported by morphological and distributional considerations. The cladogram below shows phylogenetic relationships in the Tribe Melanthieae; shaded names represent nodes which contain species formerly placed in the broadly defined &quot;Zigadenus&quot;.

The distributions and some key features of the genera into which &quot;Zigadenus&quot; is divided are:

*&quot;Zigadenus&quot; (south-east US): rhizome (no bulb), 2 conspicuous glands per tepal.
*&quot;Amianthium&quot; (south-east US): ovoid bulb, seeds with red to purple sarcotesta.
*&quot;Stenanthium&quot; (south-east US): slender cylindrical bulb, seeds brown with no sarcotesta.
*&quot;Toxicoscordion&quot; (mid-western US and western North America): tepals with claws and 1 conspicuous rounded gland.
*&quot;Anticlea&quot; (Asia, North and Central America as far south as Guatemala): narrow tepals with 1 conspicuous bilobed gland.

===Species transferred to other genera===

Around twenty species were included in the genus &quot;Zigadenus&quot; as it was previously circumscribed. &quot;Zigadenus glaberrimus&quot;, sandbog deathcamas, is the only species remaining. &quot;Zigadenus&quot; species which have been transferred to other genera are listed below under their new name.

*&quot;Amianthium muscitotoxum&quot; - Flypoison

*&quot;Anticlea elegans&quot; - Elegant camas, alkali grass, mountain deathcamas
*&quot;Anticlea hintoniorum&quot;
*&quot;Anticlea mogollonensis&quot; - Mogollon deathcamas
*&quot;Anticlea neglecta&quot;
*&quot;Anticlea sibirica&quot;
*&quot;Anticlea vaginata&quot; - Sheathed deathcamas
*&quot;Anticlea virescens&quot; - Green deathcamas
*&quot;Anticlea volcanica&quot; - Lava deathcamas

*&quot;Stenanthium densum&quot; (plus &quot;Stenanthium leimanthoides&quot; for those sources regarding this as a distinct species) - Osceola&#x27;s Plume, Black Snakeroot, Crow Poison, Pinebarren Deathcamas 
*&quot;Stenanthium gramineum&quot; - Featherbells
*&quot;Toxicoscordion brevibracteatum&quot; - Desert deathcamas
*&quot;Toxicoscordion exaltatum&quot; - Giant deathcamas
*&quot;Toxicoscordion fontanum&quot; – Smallflower deathcamas
*&quot;Toxicoscordion fremontii&quot; - Fremont&#x27;s deathcamas, star zigadene - (several varieties)
*&quot;Toxicoscordion nuttallii&quot; - Nuttall&#x27;s deathcamas
*&quot;Toxicoscordion paniculatum&quot; - Foothill deathcamas, sand-corn
*&quot;Toxicoscordion venenosum&quot; - Deathcamas, meadow deathcamas - (several varieties)
*&quot;Toxicoscordion micranthum&quot; - Smallflower deathcamas

In addition, three species have been transferred from &quot;Stenanthium&quot; to &quot;Anticlea&quot;.
*&quot;Anticlea frigida&quot;
*&quot;Anticlea occidentalis&quot;
*&quot;Anticlea sachalinensis&quot;

==Genera==

;&quot;Amianthium&quot;

&quot;Amianthium&quot; consists of a single species, &quot;A. muscitotoxum&quot;, known as flypoison. It is found in eastern North America. It grows from a bulb and has a dense oval-shaped inflorescence. Individual flowers start off white and develop red-green shades with age. All parts of the plant are poisonous; two unique alkaloids, jervine and amianthine, contribute to its toxicity.

;&quot;Anticlea&quot;

As currently circumscribed, &quot;Anticlea&quot; consists of about 11 species, found in Asia, North America and Central America down to Guatemala. &quot;Anticlea elegans&quot; (the mountain deathcamas) is one of the best known. Like other species in the genus, it grows from bulbs and has flowers with relatively narrow tepals, in this case coloured white to green.

;&quot;Melanthium&quot;

&quot;Melanthium&quot; is sometimes included in the closely related genus &quot;Veratrum&quot;. , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes four species, found in the central and eastern United States. Their flowers differ from &quot;Veratrum&quot; by being arranged in more open and delicate-looking inflorescences and by having tepals which narrow at the base.
;&quot;Schoenocaulon&quot; 

&quot;Schoenocaulon&quot; is a genus of around 25 species. The precise number is unclear; two species were only discovered in 2008, and many occur only in remote regions of Mexico, where their montane forest habitat is under threat. The centre of diversity is in Mexico. They are also found in Central America, with a few species extending into South America, and in the United States, along the eastern part of the border with Mexico and in Florida. They grow from a bulb with a fibrous coat and have a long narrow spike-like inflorescence made up of very small flowers with long protruding stamens.

;&quot;Stenanthium&quot;

, &quot;Stenanthium&quot; consists of three or four species (depending on whether &quot;S. leimanthoides&quot; is recognized) found in the south eastern United States. Like the other species, &quot;Stenanthium gramineum&quot; (feather bells) grows from a slender bulb, and has inflorescences with a complex branching structure in which individual flowers have narrow tapering tepals.

;&quot;Toxicoscordion&quot;

Eight species are included in the genus &quot;Toxicoscordion&quot;, which is found in western North America. The well-known poisonous species formerly placed in &quot;Zigadenus&quot;, the &quot;deathcamas&quot;, are now included in &quot;Toxicoscordion&quot;. Plants grow from an ovoid bulb and have tepals which are narrowed at their bases to form a &quot;claw&quot;. &quot;Toxicoscordion venenosum&quot;, the meadow deathcamas, is one of the more widely distributed species. Its flowers are white to cream in colour and grow in pointed clusters.

;&quot;Veratrum&quot;

&quot;Veratrum&quot; is found throughout temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The genus has possibly as many as 40 species, depending on how finely some of the widely distributed species are divided and whether the closely related genus &quot;Melanthium&quot; is included or not. Plants grow from a combination of short rhizomes and bulbs. They generally have quite large leaves and inflorescences in which individual flowers vary in colour from white to green, yellow or purple. They contain a variety of alkaloids which make them poisonous, although some have medical uses. Some species are cultivated for their form as well as their flowers.

;&quot;Zigadenus&quot;

The genus &quot;Zigadenus&quot; now contains only a single species &quot;Z. glaberrimus&quot;, the sandbog deathcamas. Found in the south eastern United States, it grows from thick rhizomes rather than bulbs. The flowers are grouped into a loose inflorescence and are white to cream in colour.

<text>Louis Gabriel Ambroise, [[Vicomte]] de Bonald (2 October 1754 — 23 November 1840) was a French counter-revolutionary philosopher and politician. He is mainly remembered for developing a theoretical framework from which French sociology would emerge.

==Life==

=== Early life and education ===

Bonald came from an ancient noble family of Provence. Louis was born in the chateau of Le Monna, a modest estate that served as the family seat; the only son in his family, Louis was heir to the family estate. Le Monna is situated just east of the market town of Millau, overlooking the Dourbie river. His father, Antoine Sébastien de Bonald, died when Louis was four years old and the young boy would be brought up by his pious mother Anne &quot;née&quot; de Boyer du Bosc de Périe. Like many in the provincial nobility of the time, Anne was influenced by the Jansenists and brought up her son with a stern Catholic piety. De Bonald was tutored at Le Monna until the age of eleven, when he was sent to boarding school in Paris. He would then move to the Oratorian College of Juilly at age fifteen at the behest of his mother. The Oratorians were known for their rigor and grounded de Bonald in the classics, as well as in mathematics, philosophy, and especially history. The headmaster of the school, Father Mandar, was a friend of Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and de Bonald was most likely acquainted with the writings of the &quot;philosophes&quot; early on.

He left Juilly in 1772 and entered the musketeers the following year. His unit was attached to King Louis XV at Versailles before being disbanded in 1776. After leaving the military, de Bonald returned to his estates in his native region of Rouergue. He assumed the life of a country gentleman, and took an interest in growing his properties and making them as productive as possible. He married a country nobleman’s daughter, Elisabeth-Marguerite de Guibal de Combescure, and the two had seven children, four of whom lived past childhood. One of their sons, Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald, would go on to become the Cardinal-Archbishop of Lyon. His other son, Victor, would have a writing career of his own and would write a biography of his father.

=== Revolution and exile ===
He was elected to the town council of Millau in 1782 and was appointed mayor by the province&#x27;s royal governor in 1785. He was popular as mayor and after the introduction of election for local officials in 1789, rather than appointment, he easily won reelection in February 1790. He was elected as a deputy to the departmental assembly later that year. De Bonald was at first supportive of the French Revolution and its initial decentralizing tendencies, and hoped the nobility would recover powers lost during the centralization of the 17th century. He even lead the citizens of Millau in drafting a letter of congratulations to the National Assembly, King Louis XVI, and to finance minister Jacques Necker, expressing the wish that &quot;this sacred title of citizen [and] the spirit of concord and fraternity&quot; would lead to a new sense of solidarity. He managed to quell the Great Fear in his region and would earn the thanks of the National Assembly, and he would be elected president of the departmental assembly soon after. However he soured on the Revolution with the enactment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in July 1790. Feeling unable to carry out the decrees of the Constitution in good conscience, he resigned from his post in January 1791.

Fearing that his position as a former public official would make him the target of reprisals, he emigrated with his two eldest sons – leaving behind his wife, mother, and his remaining children – in October 1791 and joined the army of the Prince of Condé. He was within earshot of the Battle of Jemappes in November 1792. He soon settled in Heidelberg and later moved to Switzerland. There he wrote his first important work, the highly conservative &quot;Theorie du Pouvoir Politique et Religieux dans la Societe Civile Demontree par le Raisonnement et l&#x27;Histoire&quot; (3 vols., 1796; new ed., Paris, 1854, 2 vols.), which the Directory condemned. His exile would separate him from his family for more than a decade, with only a brief reunion in 1797.

He returned to France in 1797 and largely spent the next five years in Paris in a sort of internal exile. Napoleon was an admirer of de Bonald&#x27;s writings and had him removed from the list of proscribed émigrés in 1802. This amnesty granted de Bonald a greater degree of freedom to travel and publish his writings. He moved within literary and political circles, and would make the acquittance of writers such as La Harpe, Lacretelle, and, most importantly, François-René de Chateaubriand. During this time he wrote a critical review of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; by Adam Smith, arguing that the true common good of a nation lies in a shared life of virtue and not simply in material prosperity. He would strike up a long correspondence and friendship with the conservative Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre, however the two would never meet. In 1806, he, along with Chateaubriand and Joseph Fiévée, edited the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. Two years later, he was appointed counsellor of the Imperial University, which he had often attacked previously.

=== Bourbon Restoration and political career ===
The Bourbon Restoration saw de Bonald&#x27;s political fortunes increase. He was made a member of the Royal Council for Public Instruction, and in 1816 was appointed to the French Academy by Louis XVIII. From 1815 to 1823, de Bonald served as an elected deputy for Aveyron in the Chamber of Deputies. A member of the Ultra-royalist faction (also known as &quot;Ultras&quot;), his speeches were extremely conservative and he vigorously sought to undo the legislation passed in the wake of the Revolution. He opposed the Charter of 1814, seeing it as giving too many concessions to the revolutionaries and enfeebling the government. He sought strong protections for the traditional family and in 1815 successfully argued for the repeal of laws passed during the Revolution permitting divorce, which afterwards remained illegal in France until 1884.

The Revolution had abolished the remainder of the medieval trade guilds, affording little protection to workers. The Le Chapelier Law of 1791 forbade workers the right to form workers&#x27; associations and prohibited strike actions. De Bonald worked to reverse the Le Chapelier Law and reintroduce guilds but his efforts were unsuccessful, and the right to form workers&#x27; associations would not be reintroduced in France until 1864.

He also continued his writing career during this time, and his intellectual pursuits led to him visit many of Paris&#x27; Salons. Both de Bonald and Chateaubriand frequented the salon of Juliette Récamier, who drew from the leading literary and political circles of her day. He, along with Chateaubriand, contributed to various newspapers and journals, including &quot;The Correspondant&quot;, a journal of French and British thinkers, as well as &quot;Conservateur&quot;, a newspaper dedicated to defending the position of the Ultras. 1817 saw the publication of his &quot;Thoughts on Various Subjects&quot;, and his &quot;Observations on Madame de Staël&#x27;s Considerations on the Principle Events of the French Revolution&quot; in the following year&quot;.&quot;

=== Peerage and later life ===

In 1822, de Bonald was made Minister of State, and in the following year, he was raised to the peerage by Louis XVIII, a dignity which he had lost by refusing to take the required oath in 1803. This entitled de Bonald to sit in the Chamber of Peers, the upper house of the French Parliament during the Bourbon Restoration. In 1825, he argued strongly in favor of the Anti-Sacrilege Act, including its prescription of the death penalty under certain conditions. In 1826, de Bonald briefly stepped away from politics due to the death of his wife.

In 1826, the Prime Minister and leader of the Ultras, Joseph de Villèle, introduced a bill reestablishing the law of primogeniture, at least for owners of large estates, unless they chose otherwise. The Revolution had radically changed inheritance law by mandating partitive inheritance, where property is dispersed equally among heirs, in order to break up aristocratic holdings. The proposed law was met with fierce opposition from the liberal Doctrinaires, the press, and even from Dissident Ultras, such as Chateaubriand. De Bonald&#x27;s &quot;On the Agricultural Family, the Industrial Family, and the Right of Primogeniture&quot; was written in defense of primogeniture, agrarianism, and the proposed law. The government tried to manage popular outrage by attempting to pass a bill in December of that year curtailing the press, having largely withdrawn censorship in 1824. This only inflamed tensions and the proposed changes to inheritance were dropped by the government.

In 1827, Charles X created a commission on censorship and tasked de Bonald with presiding over it. This position would lead to the end of his long friendship with Chateaubriand, who opposed literary censorship. De Bonald&#x27;s own attitudes towards censorship were somewhat mixed; he was in favor of taking a hard line on books since objectionable material in this form would be harder to take out of circulation, however he felt newspapers and periodicals should enjoy a greater degree of freedom. He felt that offending journalists and publishers should be first given a warning and then face legal prosecution if they continued to publish material detrimental to the public order. Bonald felt that the censorship practices of the 17th century would be anachronistic in the 19th century, and that the best way to combat error would be through the &quot;marketplace of ideas.&quot; Bonald himself had voted against a proposed censorship law in 1817 as giving too much power to the government.

He retired from the Chamber of Peers in 1829. Following the July Revolution and the institution of the liberal July Monarchy in 1830, he retired from public life for good and spent the remainder of his days on his estate at Le Monna.

==Philosophy==
=== Politics ===

Bonald&#x27;s political philosophy rests on the assumptions of humanity&#x27;s fallenness, the need for strong government to repress man&#x27;s evil tendencies, and the belief that humans are inherently social creatures. He opposed the individualistic and atomistic tendencies of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. At the heart of his political thought was the idea that the family was the basis of society and that institutions should work to protect it in its traditional form. For this reason he opposed the secularization of marriage, divorce, and partitive inheritance. He was also critical of the Industrial Revolution because of its negative effects on traditional patterns of family life.

The sharing of power, as in a democracy, seemed ludicrous to Bonald, and the doctrine of the separation of powers tended towards anarchy. The monarch rules for the good of society and thus represents the general will, contrary to Rousseau; whereas a multitude of individual wills, even when united in purpose, do not constitute the general will.

=== Economics ===
Bonald was also an early critic of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics. In 1806, he wrote a treatise critical of usury, or the practice of lending at interest, and in 1810 he wrote a critical review of the French edition of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. He was likewise critical of Louis XVI&#x27;s finance minister, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, a physiocrat who liberalised France&#x27;s grain trade and supported the suppression of the trade guilds. Bonald criticised Turgot as a &quot;fanatical partisan of a materialistic politics.&quot; Elsewhere he says, &quot;[w]heat was not given to man to be an object of commerce, but to nourish him.&quot; Shaped by Tacitus and his condemnations of Roman decadence, Bonald felt that economic liberalism and unrestrained wealth would undermine the Christian character of the French people, and would lead men to become less generous and more self-centered.

=== Religion ===
Bonald was one of the leading writers of the theocratic or traditionalist school, which included Maistre, Lamennais, Ballanche and Ferdinand d&#x27;Eckstein. The traditionalist school, in reaction to the rationalists, believed that human reason was incapable of even arriving at natural religion, and that tradition, the result of a primitive revelation, was necessary to know both natural religion as well as the truths of supernatural revelation. Bonald believed that the principles of good governance could be deduced from history and sacred scripture. His political thought is closely tied to his theory of the divine origin of language. Since man learns to speak through imitation, he believed that the first man must have learned to speak from God, who announced all moral principles to this first man. In his own words, &quot;L&#x27;homme pense sa parole avant de parler sa pensée&quot; (man thinks his speech before saying his thought); the first language contained the essence of all truth. These moral truths were then codified in Holy Scripture. From this he deduces the existence of God, the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures, and the infallibility of the Catholic Church.

Bonald published an anti-Semitic text during the post-French Revolutionary period, &quot;Sur les juifs&quot;, in which he described Jews an alien race, describing them with the same racialized language he used to attack the recently emancipated Black slaves in the colonies. In it, the &quot;philosophes&quot; are condemned for fashioning the intellectual tools used to justify Jewish emancipation during the Revolution. Bonald accused French Jews of not becoming &quot;authentic&quot; French citizens and of being a disruptive force in traditional society. Bonald called for the reversal of Jewish emancipation and endorsed new discriminatory measures, such as a distinctive mark which Jews would be forced to wear to identify them in public.

=== Metaphysics ===
While this thought lies at the root of all his speculations, there is a formula of constant application. All relations may be stated as the triad of cause, means and effect, which he sees repeated throughout nature and society. Thus, in the universe, he finds the First Cause as mover, movement as the means, and bodies as the result; in the state, power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as the effects; in the family, the same relation is exemplified by father, mother and children; and in political society, the monarch as cause, ministers/nobility as means, and the subjects as effect. These three terms bear specific relations to one another; the first is to the second as the second to the third. Thus, in the great triad of the religious world—God, the Mediator, and Man—God is to the God-Man as the God-Man is to Man. On this basis, he constructed a system of political absolutism.

== Influence ==
Bonald&#x27;s writings exercised a great deal of influence over conservative and French Catholic thought throughout the 19th century. The French writer Honoré de Balzac considered himself to be an intellectual heir of Bonald and took up many Bonaldian themes in his writings, once declaring that &quot;when it beheaded Louis XVI, the Revolution beheaded in his person all fathers of families.&quot; Bonald&#x27;s influence carried on throughout the counter-revolutionary tradition in the writings of Spanish conservative Juan Donoso Cortés, Italian philosopher Monaldo Leopardi and the ultramontane French journalist Louis Veuillot. His writings also exerted a great influence over the corporatist philosophical tradition through Frédéric le Play and René de La Tour du Pin, and through them he had an influence on the development of the principle of solidarity in Catholic social thought.

Bonald&#x27;s direct influence fell into decline after World War I, especially outside of French Catholic circles. Since then he has generally suffered neglect at the hands of economic historians and historians of Catholic thought. Bonald&#x27;s thought has often drawn more positive attention from historians working within the Marxist or socialist tradition.

<doc id="629225" wikidata="Q5635701" url="?curid=629225" title="NewWave">
<text>NewWave is a discontinued object-oriented graphical desktop environment and office productivity tool for PCs running early versions of Microsoft Windows (beginning with 2.0). It was developed by Hewlett-Packard and introduced commercially in 1988. It was used on the HP Vectras and other IBM-compatible PCs running Windows.

From a user perspective NewWave ran on top of Windows and completely replaced the standard Windows Desktop and Program Manager user interface with its own object-oriented desktop interface.

HP promoted NewWave until the release of Windows 95, at which time further development of the product ceased due to incompatibility with the new operating system. The NewWave GUI (together with the contemporaneous NeXTSTEP GUI) introduced the shaded &quot;3-D look and feel&quot; that was later widely adopted.

HP encouraged independent software vendors to produce versions of applications which took advantage of NewWave functionality, allowing their data to be handled as objects instead of files. One early example was Samna Corporation (later acquired by Lotus) who produced an edition of their Microsoft Windows word processor Ami Pro entitled &quot;Ami Pro for NewWave&quot;. On June 20, 1988 Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard issued a press release announcing the inclusion of NewWave support in an up-coming release Microsoft Excel.

NewWave featured icons, scheduled scripts in the form of &quot;agents&quot;, and &quot;hot connects.&quot;

HP incorporated NewWave into their multi-platform office automation offerings running under their proprietary MPE and HP-UX (UNIX) minicomputer operating systems. They developed NewWave versions of key email, database, document management, personal productivity, communications and network management tools and branded all related solutions under the “HP NewWave Office” banner. Prior to the integration of HP NewWave this solution set had been known as “Business System Plus”. The “NewWave Office” term had been used previously to describe the main NewWave user desktop.

==Overview==
In its original November 1987 press release Hewlett-Packard described NewWave as “an application environment designed to provide personal computer users with a single method to access data and files from multiple sources on a company’s network”. It was developed by HP’s Personal Software Division (PSD) in Santa Clara, California, United States, as part of their distributed computing environment strategy, after three years of work by more than 100 employees.

The original version of NewWave ran on IBM-compatible PCs and required MS-DOS 3.2 or later and Windows 2.0 or later.

Key features of NewWave included:
*An icon-based user interface.
*An Object Management Facility (OMF) which completely replaced the MS-DOS / Windows file-based system.
*“Hot connects” - ensuring data changed in one file are automatically updated in related files in which those data are used.
*Agents, based on artificial intelligence (AI) principles, which could be set to perform routing activities such as gathering data from various computers to create a monthly sales report. Agents could follow a procedure carried out by an end-user and remember it so it could be repeated at a specified time or executed under certain conditions.

===Pricing===
*HP NewWave Developers Kit - released February 1988: $895 (US)
*HP NewWave end-user version - released second-half 1988: $195 (US)

===Object Management Facility (OMF)===
HP described the OMF as a means of binding applications and data together to form “objects”, such as compound documents.

===Contextual online help===
In addition to MS-Windows-style indexed help articles NewWave introduced a context-sensitive help facility. This allowed a user to click on a ‘Help’ menu option which added a query symbol to the mouse arrow; once switched into this ‘help mode’ the user could click on any part of the NewWave environment or any menu command to have the help for that item displayed in a pop-up window.

===Computer-based training===
Working in conjunction with the NewWave Agent the computer-based training functionality of NewWave allowed developers to build interactive lessons into the desktop environment and the applications themselves. This allowed users to learn with actual live applications in a non-destructive way. The feature was dropped in later versions of NewWave due to the increased disk requirements it imposed and the limited hard disk space available in PCs of the time.

===Agent===
The NewWave Agent was a task-recording and execution facility, which could work across multiple applications. Users could record any sequence of tasks performed within the NewWave environment. Recorded tasks generated a BASIC-like source-code, which could be repeated unmodified, or edited and expanded to create sophisticated automated and interactive activities.

===Built-in and bridged applications===
NewWave included some built-in applications, which were fully integrated with the Object Management Facility, NewWave Agent, Online Help and Computer Based Training features. Non-native NewWave applications could be integrated into the environment using “advanced bridges”, allowing their live data to be embedded in compound documents. The standard end-user version of HP NewWave included bridges for HP’s own PC applications, such as HP Graphics gallery, MS Windows tools (calculator, calendar, notepad etc.) and many common third-party applications. Users could also create their own bridges to other applications using the included Bridge Builder tool. Bridges could be exported for use on other NewWave-enabled systems and were often shared amongst the NewWave user community.

====NewWave Write====
HP described NewWave Write as a basic-to-intermediate level “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWIG) word processor with support for compound documents.

====NewWave Mail====
NewWave Mail was available as a separate native NewWave product, which could act as a client to HP’s proprietary DeskManager and OpenMail email server solutions.

====Third-party applications====
HP succeeded in establishing a third-party developer program following the release of the NewWave Software Developer’s Kit (SDK) in February 1988.

NewWave enabled third-party applications included:
====NewWave bridged third-party applications====
Third-party application bridges shipped with the end-user release of HP NewWave included:
==History==
During its eight-year life HP NewWave underwent several functional and cosmetic changes, including a revision of the desktop interface and the dropping of the built-in Computer Based Training facility.

===Apple lawsuit===
Because of alleged similarities to the Macintosh GUI, NewWave was the subject of an unsuccessful &quot;look and feel&quot; lawsuit by Apple (see Apple v. Microsoft).

==Reception==
While praising HP&#x27;s &quot;serious, sincere effort&quot; to give Windows &quot;a complete, object-oriented&quot; GUI, Stewart Alsop II in 1988 doubted that other software developers would create software for NewWave because HP &quot;is not considered a standard setter&quot;, IBM and Microsoft had their own desktop-metaphor plans, and existing applications needed &quot;a substantial redesign and rewrite&quot; to effectively use it.

HP NewWave was never adopted as a mainstream end-user environment although it was adopted by a number of corporate clients as the basis for office productivity projects including:
*BT BoaT - Major British Telecom office automation project.
*Royal Insurance - desktop project implemented by the Liverpool-based insurance company.
*N&amp;P - National and Provincial building society - based in Bradford.
*TSB Trust Company - Desktop architecture.

HP had some success in licensing NewWave to other hardware manufacturers:
*Data General repackaged NewWave as &quot;CEO Object Office&quot;, and introduced it as an extension to their &quot;CEO Office&quot; office automation software.
*NCR used NewWave as the basis for their &quot;Cooperation&quot; software.

==Legacy==
In January 1990 HP stated its intention to provide NewWave capabilities on Unix with Motif and on OS/2 with Presentation Manager. Although these versions were never released HP did contribute some of its NewWave technology to projects run by the Open Software Foundation of which HP was a member.

<text>Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald (30 October 1787 – 23 February 1870) was a French cardinal and Archbishop of Lyon.

==Biography==
Born at Millau, he was the son of the philosopher Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald.
He was condemned by the council of state for a pastoral letter attacking Dupin the elder&#x27;s &quot;Manuel de droit ecclsiastique.&quot; In 1848 he held a memorial service for those who fell gloriously in defence of civil and religious liberty. In 1851 he nevertheless advocated in the senate the maintenance of the temporal power of the Pope by force of arms.

He commands the zone, the region and the Mediterranean maritime &quot;arrondissements&quot;. He is usually an admiral of the French Navy, and is under the direct authority of the French Chief of the Defence Staff. the position was held by Admiral Yann Tainguy.

CECMED today is simultaneously:
* Commander of the région and the Mediterranean maritime &quot;arrondissement&quot;,
* Maritime Zone commander,
* Maritime Prefect for the Méditerranean.

Today the main French naval combat force in the Mediterranean is the Force d&#x27;action navale (FAN) headquartered at Toulon. The Admiral commanding the Naval Action Force (ALFAN) is responsible to the Chief of Staff of the French Navy at the rue Royale in Paris.

==History==

===Mediterranean Squadron===
Vice-amiral François Fournier was Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Squadron (&quot;Commandant en chef l&#x27;Escadre de Méditerranée&quot;, :fr:Escadre de la Méditerranée) in January 1899 aboard &quot;Galilée&quot;.

On 20 July 1921 after a series of designation changes, the force again became the Mediterranean Squadron. It became the 1st Squadron on 1 January 1927; the Mediterranean Squadron on 30 October 1936; and the Mediterranean Fleet on 1 July 1939. On the outbreak of war the fleet consisted of the 2nd Squadron (Vice Amiral d&#x27;Escadre Emmanuel Ollive) at Toulon, with three older battleships (including &quot;Bretagne&quot; and &quot;Provence&quot;) and their fleet torpedo boat escorts; the 3rd Squadron of two divisions of 10,000-ton cruisers (Algerie, Dupleix, Foch in 1e DC) and three divisions of contretorpilleurs, also at Toulon, and the 4th Squadron at Bizerte with a light cruiser division and three divisions of contretorpilleurs, under Rear Admiral André Marquis.

In September 1939 the fleet included:
*2ème Escadre (VAE Ollive) : Provence (VAE Ollive - CV Barois)
**2ème DL : Lorraine * (CA Vallée - CV Aurin) - Bretagne (CV Seguin)
**1ère FT (CV Longaud) :
***1ère DT : La Palme ° (CV Longaud) - Le Mars (CC Lamote) –Tempête (CC Pellegrin)
***3ème DT : Le Fortuné ° (CC d’Hespel)– La Railleuse (CC Hourcade) – Simoun (CC Hainguerlot)
***7ème DT : Tramontane ° (CF Renault) - Typhon (CC Le Hagre) – Tornade (CC Labat)
*3ème Escadre (VA Duplat) :- 
**1ère &quot;Division de Croiseurs&quot;: Algérie *** (VA Duplat - CV Nouvel de la Flèche) - Dupleix (CV Hameury) – &quot;Foch&quot; (CV Mathieu) - &quot;Colbert&quot; (ship list as of 1 July 1939)
**2ème DC : Duquesne ** (CA Kerdudo – CV Husson) – Tourville (CV Marloy)
**3ème EL (CA Derrien) :
***5ème DCT : Tartu ° (CV Chomel) - Chevalier Paul (CF Bonnot) – Vauquelin (CF Jaujard)

**3ème DC : Marseillaise ** (CA Marquis – CV Hamon) - Jean de Vienne (CV Missoffe) – &quot;La Galissonniere&quot; (CV Dupré)
**Non endivisionné : Emile Bertin (CV Battet)

The twentieth century history of the French Navy in the Mediterranean includes surveillance of actions during the Spanish Civil War. On 14 June 1940, the 3rd Escadre executed Operation Samoyède. The squadron, including the cruisers Foch, Algérie, &quot;Dupleix&quot; and &quot;Colbert&quot;, bombarded Genoa, supported by French Naval Aviation.

In 1940, after the fall of France, the Royal Navy launched the attack on Mers-el-Kébir which disabled most of the French surface fleet in 1940 to prevent it from falling into German hands. In 1942 the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon took place for the same reason. The Navy also protected troop convoys from French Algeria to France in both World Wars, and played a peripheral role in the Algerian War from 1954 to 1962. In 1956 the French Navy joined forces the Royal Navy to take control of the Suez Canal in Egypt during the Suez Crisis. In 1964, the cruiser &quot;Colbert&quot; became flagship of the Mediterranean squadron. The regional Mediterranean and Atlantic fleets (Amiral commandant l&#x27;escadre de la Méditerranée, ALESCMED, and Atlantic equivalent ALESCLANT), were replaced by ALFAN (the Naval Action Force) and Admiral, Antisubmarine Group (ALGASM) as part of Optimar &#x27;95, the post-Cold War restructuring process.

===Mediterranean naval forces within the Force d&#x27;action navale===
In the 2020s, French naval forces in the Mediterranean are one element within the Force d&#x27;action navale of the French Navy. The &quot;force d&#x27;action navale&quot; is composed of ships based both in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. However, as of 2022 the majority of the fleet&#x27;s major combatants are based in the Mediterranean, including: 

* Six nuclear-powered attack submarines of the Rubis and Barracuda classes
* The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle;
* Three Mistral-class amphibious assault ships;
* Two Horizon-class air defence frigates;
* Four Aquitaine-class frigates; and,
* Five La Fayette-class frigates.

<doc id="629237" wikidata="Q622855" url="?curid=629237" title="Ifriqiya">
<text>Ifriqiya ( &#x27;), also known asal-Maghrib al-Adna (), was a medieval historical region comprising today&#x27;s Tunisia, eastern Algeria, and Tripolitania (roughly western Libya). It included all of what had previously been the Byzantine province of Africa Proconsularis and extended beyond it, but did not include the Mauretanias.

To the south, Ifriqiya was bounded by the semi-arid lands and salt marshes named el-Djerid. The northern boundary fluctuated from as far north as Sicily to the North African coastline, and the western boundary usually reached Béjaïa. Ifriqiya is bordered to the west by the Central Maghreb, with which the borders are fluid depending on the chroniclers and the eras. The capital was briefly Carthage, then Qayrawan (Kairouan), then Mahdia, then Tunis. The Aghlabids, from their base in Kairouan, initiated the invasion of Southern Italy beginning in 827, and established the Emirate of Sicily, which lasted until it was conquered by the Normans, and the short-lived Emirate of Bari.

== History ==

The province of Ifriqiya was created in 703 CE when the Umayyads seized North Africa from the Byzantine Empire. Although Islam existed throughout the province, there was still considerable religious tension and conflict between the invading Arabs and the native Berbers. The beliefs and perceptions of people also shifted from area to area. This contrast was at its greatest between coastal cities and villages. Muslim ownership of Ifriqiya changed hands numerous times in its history with the collapse of the Umayyads paving the way for the Aghlabids, who acted as agents of the Abbasids in Baghdad.

They were then overthrown by the Fatimids in 909, when they lost their capital of Raqqada and the Fatimids went on to control all of Ifriqiya in 969, when they took control of Egypt. The Fatimids slowly lost control over Ifriqiya as their regents, the Zirids, became more and more autonomous until the mid-11th century when they fully separated.

Religious divisions paved the way for the Almohads to take over western Ifriqiya (Maghreb) in 1147 and all of Ifriqiya by 1160. This empire was to last until the early 13th century where it was then replaced by the Hafsids, an influential clan that boasted many of Ifriqiya&#x27;s governors. The Hafsids in 1229 declared their independence from the Almohads and organized themselves under Abu Zakariya, who built the Hafsid empire around its new capital, Tunis.

Records of Arabic oral traditions imply that the Muslims first migrated to Africa feeling persecuted in their Arab homeland. However, Muslim military incursions into Africa began around seven years after the death of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in 632. This campaign into Africa was led by the General Amr ibn al-As and Muslim control of Africa rapidly spread after the initial seizure of Alexandria.

Islam slowly took root in the East African coast due to cross-cultural links established between Muslim traders and the natives of the African coast. The political situation in Islamic Africa was like any other, filled with a chaotic and constant power struggle between movements and dynasties. A key factor in the success of any hopeful party was securing the wealth to fund a push for dominance. One source of great wealth was the lucrative gold-mining areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The existence of these gold mines made expansion into Africa very worthwhile. The Muslim Empires pushed for influence and control of both the Northern and Southern parts of Africa. By the end of the 11th century, Islam had firmly established itself along the Mediterranean. Like the Europeans, Muslims felt the brutal effects of the Black Death in the 14th century when it arrived in Western Africa (Maghreb) through Europe. Maghreb and Ifriqiya were largely under the rule of the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 18th centuries. Around the end of the 19th century, Islam accounted for 1/3rd of the religious population of Africa.

== Notable people ==
=== Constantine the African ===
Constantine the African was a scholar who was born in Carthage and migrated to Sicily in the 11th century. Constantine traveled through places such as Cairo, India and Ethiopia, and his knowledge of numerous languages helped him interpret many academic texts.

His greatest work came when he joined the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino, where he translated over 30 books, including works by Isaac the Jew, one of the most accomplished physicians in the Western Caliphate. He translated Muslim books on medicine from Arabic to Latin, opening Europe up to a wave of medical knowledge they had had little access to before. His book &quot;The Total Art&quot; is based on &quot;The Royal Book&quot; by Persian physician Ali ibn al Abbas.

=== Ibn Khaldun ===
Ibn Khaldun, a historian born in Tunis, was one of the most prolific academics of the Middle Ages. Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s book &quot;Muqadimmah&quot; influenced waves of writers in Egypt, Turkey, and France from the 15th through 19th centuries. Ibn Khaldun served in numerous political positions in al Andalus and Al Maghreb. He fell in and out of favor with the many different powers that rose and fell in Ifriqiya. In the latter 14th century Ibn Khaldun took refuge with a tribe in Algeria and began his four-year endeavor to write an introduction to history, &quot;Muqadimmah&quot;. Volume I laid the groundwork for sociology, while the two volumes that followed explored the world of politics, subsequent books explored many different themes such as urban life, economics and the study of knowledge. He spent his later years as a judge of the Maliki fiqh in Egypt where he took his work very seriously, evaluating each case on its merits and constantly trying to eradicate flaws that he discovered in the judicial system. His somewhat strict approach to Islamic laws made some Egyptians uneasy, so he eventually left his position and traveled through the eastern reaches of the Arab world. In 1400, he parleyed outside Damascus with Timur, who was in awe of his wisdom. He managed to secure safe passage for many of the inhabitants of Damascus but could not save the city or its mosque from being sacked. After this, he went to Cairo and spent the remainder of his years in relative peace and quiet. He died in 1406 and was buried outside Cairo.

<text>Eurosport is a group of pay television networks in Europe and parts of Asia. Owned by Warner Bros. Discovery through its TNT Sports International unit, it operates two main channels—Eurosport 1 and Eurosport 2—across most of its territories, and streams on Max and Discovery+.

Originally a joint venture between the European Broadcasting Union and Sky established in 1989, it was briefly shut down in 1991 following complaints by competitor Screensport. It was subsequently acquired by TF1 Group, and later merged with Screensport. For a period, it was a joint venture between TF1, Canal+ Group, and Havas Images. TF1 Group later bought out the other owners&#x27; shares. In 2012, Discovery Communications began to take an ownership in Eurosport, eventually leading to a full buyout in 2015.

Eurosport is the main rights holder of the Olympic Games in most of Europe, as well as (with some exceptions) the tennis Grand Slam tournaments.

The network of channels is available in 54 countries, in 20 different languages, providing viewers with European and international sporting events. Eurosport had 157 million subscribers in 2019, while the Eurosport 2 channel had an audience of 87 million viewers. For the most part, there is no on-screen presenter, only unseen commentators, allowing the same video feed to be used in multiple markets with different language audio.

== History ==

Prior to the creation of Eurosport, the European Broadcasting Union had acquired substantial amounts of sports rights, yet its members were only able to broadcast a fraction of them. This provided the impetus for setting up the Eurosport Consortium, made up of several EBU members, to establish an outlet where these rights could be exploited. Sky Television was chosen as a commercial partner to the EBU project, and the channel launched at 6pm on 5 February 1989. It largely replaced the original Sky Channel (later rebranded Sky One) on European cable systems. Sky Channel refocused to serve only the United Kingdom and Ireland. For a period of time, some of Sky Channel&#x27;s former pan-European programming was broadcast in the hours before Eurosport&#x27;s startup, under the brand &quot;Sky Europe&quot;.

===1991 closure, takeover by TF1===
Eurosport was closed down in May 1991 after rival Screensport channel filed a complaint to the European Commission over the corporate structure. The channel was saved later that month when the TF1 Group (formed after the French government privatised the post ORTF-split TF1 5 years prior to the acquisition) stepped in to replace BSkyB as joint owners. It was able to restart its broadcast after 10 days. Broadcasting hours were restricted to 1pm to 11pm, later 8am until midnight before settling at 7.30am and 1am. Its overnight hours were occupied by shopping channel The Quantum Channel.

On 1 March 1993, the cable and satellite channel Screensport merged with Eurosport. Five days later, that channel&#x27;s transponder space was taken over by RTL II. Eurosport eventually came under a French consortium comprising the TF1 Group, Canal+ Group and Havas Images. In January 2001, TF1 took full ownership of Eurosport.

=== Eurosport Player &amp; rebrand ===
In May 2007, Yahoo! Europe and Eurosport formed a co-branded website which Eurosport used as its web portal, including an online TV guide, in the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Germany.

In 2008, Eurosport launched an online subscription service, Eurosport Player, that allows internet users to watch both Eurosport and Eurosport 2 live, plus additional coverage not available via broadcast. During the 2009 Australian Open, the internet player offered coverage from five courts.

On 5 April 2011, Eurosport rebranded its channel. The rebrand incorporated six new on-air idents along with a new logo and presentation style both on-air and off-air. The new on-air identity has been designed by Paris-based design company Les Télécréateurs. All localised Eurosport channels and the Eurosport website embraced the new identity.

===Analogue closedown===
Having been one of the first channels to broadcast on the Astra 1 group of satellites, Eurosport was the last satellite channel in Europe to broadcast in an analogue format. On 30 April 2012, shortly after 03:00 CET, the rest of the remaining analogue channels at 19.2 East ceased transmission. Eurosport&#x27;s analogue channel finally ceased transmission on 1 May 2012 at 01:30 CET, marking the end of an era in European satellite broadcasting.

===Stake and acquisition by Discovery Communications===
On 21 December 2012, Discovery Communications purchased a 20 per cent minority interest share in Eurosport from TF1 Group for €170m. Discovery became the majority shareholder in the Eurosport venture with TF1 in January 2014, taking a 51 per cent share of the company. On 22 July 2015 Discovery agreed to acquire TF1&#x27;s remaining 49 per cent stake in the venture.

On 13 November 2015, Eurosport introduced its new brand identity and changed the name of its main channel to Eurosport 1.

In 2016, Eurosport expanded its deal with The All England Club to show all the Wimbledon matches live in 19 countries, up from three under a previous deal. It was a 3-year deal (2017–2019) that included exclusive TV and digital rights. This expanded their tennis portfolio to show all four Grand Slams. Eurosport signed a new deal in 2019 to broadcast Wimbledon exclusively in 11 countries. , Eurosport broadcasts the Australian Open, French Open (except in France), US Open (except in the UK and Ireland), and Wimbledon (except in the UK).

In February 2017, Discovery launched the channel in India, branded as DSport which was later renamed to Eurosport in 2020. The channel was made available on various platforms in both SD and HD feeds.

On 5 January 2021, Discovery began to phase out Eurosport Player in favour of its new streaming service Discovery+.

=== Warner Bros. Discovery, folding of UK operations into TNT Sports ===
On 11 May 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery (a new company formed after the merger of Discovery with WarnerMedia) announced an agreement to contribute Eurosport&#x27;s UK operations into a joint venture with BT Group and BT Sport. WBD will serve as managing partner of the joint venture; the two networks would operate separately for an interim period, after which they would combine their operations under a new name. As part of the agreement, WBD also negotiated a deal for BT Group to distribute Discovery+ to its television and BT Sport subscribers.

WBD would rebrand BT Sport as TNT Sports, deriving its name from its American cable network. In January 2025, it was announced that Eurosport would close in the UK and Ireland on 28 February 2025, in favour of carrying Eurosport content via TNT Sports channels and platforms. The remaining international channels will continue to operate under the Eurosport brand.

==Channels==
===Eurosport 1===
This is the main channel of Eurosport. A high-definition simulcast version of Eurosport launched on 25 May 2008. The first event covered in HD was the 2008 French Open at Roland Garros. On 13 November 2015 it changed its name to Eurosport 1 HD.
====Eurosport 1 feeds====
In Europe, Eurosport 1 is generally available in basic cable and satellite television packages. Since 1999, Eurosport 1 provides various opt-out services providing more relevant sporting content specific to language, advertising and commentary needs. Eurosport offers a stand-alone channel which provides a standardised version of the channel (Eurosport International in English). Alongside this, there are also local Eurosport channels in France, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Poland, Nordic region, Benelux region, and Asia Pacific. These channels offer greater sporting content with local sporting events, while also utilising the existing pan-European feed. The German version of Eurosport is the only one available free-to-air on European digital satellite television.

Eurosport 1 is currently broadcast in 23 languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Greek, Turkish, Cantonese, and Croatian.

In Asia-Pacific territories, Eurosport offers a specific channel to the region. Eurosport (Asia-Pacific) launched on 15 November 2009. The service is available in Australia through Foxtel, Optus and TransACT. On 3 November 2014, a HD simulcast launched on Foxtel.

Eurosport 2 was branded as Eurosport DK in Denmark. On 15 February 2016, this channel was replaced by Eurosport 2.

Eurosport 2 HD, a high-definition version of the channel, is also available.

Eurosport 2 HD Xtra is a German pay-TV channel launched in 2017. Eurosport bought Germany-only rights for Bundesliga, Supermoto and other broadcasting rights. Eurosport 2 has no German-only signal and Eurosport 1 is free-to-air, so the new channel was needed.

=== Eurosport India ===
Eurosport India is the Indian version of the channel launched in February 2017 as DSport. It was made available on major DTH platforms and cable networks across India during the launch. The channel&#x27;s primary focus would not be cricket, as per the press meet at the launch. The current offering from the channel includes less popular football leagues, cricket premier leagues, wrestling, fighting, golf, motor sports, horse racing, cycling and rugby. The channel is only available in high-definition format. However, few DTH operators downscale the feed to be presented with the standard-definition bouquet. As of 2018, Eurosport India was available to over 110 million households in India.

<text>William Frederick Denning (25 November 1848 – 9 June 1931) was a British amateur astronomer who achieved considerable success without formal scientific training. He is known for his catalogues of meteor radiants, observations of Jupiter&#x27;s red spot, and for the discovery of five comets. Outside astronomy, as a young man, Denning showed prowess at cricket to the extent W G Grace invited him to play for Gloucestershire. However Denning&#x27;s retiring nature made him decline the offer.

==Career==
Denning devoted a great deal of time to searching for comets, and discovered five of them, including the periodic comets 72P/Denning–Fujikawa and 489P/Denning. The latter was the last comet discovered on British soil until the discoveries of George Alcock, and its recovery was announced by the Minor Planet Center with MPEC 2024-Q14.

Denning also studied meteors and novae, discovering Nova Cygni 1920 (V476 Cyg). From 1869 Denning held the combined post of secretary and treasurer of the short-lived Observing Astronomical Society. Denning was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society on 8 June 1877. He was first elected to the British Astronomical Association on 24 June 1891 and rejoined in 1898, being elected as a member on 16 October of that year. He directed its Comet Section (1891–1893) and Meteor Section (1899–1900). He won the &quot;Prix Valz&quot; of the French Academy of Sciences for 1895.

During his life, Denning published 1179 articles in prominent scientific journals including &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;The Observatory&quot;, &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;, &quot;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&quot;, &quot;Journal des Observateurs&quot;, and &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
* In 1898, Denning won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.
* He also won the Donohoe Comet Medal for his July 23, 1890 discovery of a comet.
*Such was his standing in the astronomical community that following his death a memorial tablet was fixed to his house.
* Crater &quot;Denning&quot; on the Moon as well as the Martian crater &quot;Denning&quot; were named after him in 1970 and 1973, respectively.
* Asteroid 71885 Denning, discovered by the Spacewatch program in 2000, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 October 2009 ().

<doc id="629257" wikidata="Q5631249" url="?curid=629257" title="HMS Alamein">
<text>HMS &quot;Alamein&quot; (D17) was a Later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the British Royal Navy. She was named in honour of the Battle of El Alamein, which took place in 1942 during the Second World War, between Commonwealth forces and the German Afrika Korps.

&quot;Alamein&quot; was built by R. &amp; W. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Company Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 12 May 1945 and commissioned on 20 March 1946.

==Service==
In 1946, &quot;Alamein&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. In 1948, &quot;Alamein&quot;, along with her sister-ship , escorted the aircraft carrier for exercises in Northern and Home waters, though she did not join the two on their subsequent visit to Northern Ireland.

In 1950, &quot;Alamein&quot; deployed on a Home Fleet Spring Cruise, which included many other vessels, such as , two other carriers, the battleship and many smaller vessels. The group visited the Mediterranean, including stops at Italy, and performed a number of naval exercises and fly-the-flag visits in the region. That same year, &quot;Alamein&quot; decommissioned, being placed in Reserve.

In May 1956, &quot;Alamein&quot;, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron once more after replacing her sister ship , had spells with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets, taking part in the Suez Crisis.

On 5 November 1958, in Chatham Dockyard, a fire occurred onboard &quot;Alamein&quot;. which was eventually traced to faulty wiring on radio equipment in the Wardroom, which spread to the Ops Room. Fire Parties from &quot;Alamein&quot;, HMS &quot;Corruna&quot;, whom she was alongside, plus Chatham &amp; Gillingham fire brigades fought the blaze.

In 1959, &quot;Alamein&quot; was decommissioned and placed in Reserve for the final time, being broken up at Blyth in Northumberland in 1964.

<text>Albert Walter &quot;Sparky&quot; Lyle (born July 22, 1944) is an American professional baseball pitcher who spent sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1967 through 1982. He was a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Chicago White Sox.

A three-time All-Star, he won the Cy Young Award in 1977, the first American League reliever so honored. He led the AL in saves in 1972 and 1976. With the Yankees, Lyle was a member of the World Series champions in 1977 and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Lyle co-authored, with Peter Golenbock, &quot;The Bronx Zoo&quot;, a 1979 tell-all book that chronicled the dissension within the Yankees in its World Series Championship seasons of 1977 and 1978. From 1998–2012, Lyle served as manager of the Somerset Patriots, an independent baseball team of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

Lyle is credited, alongside Rollie Fingers, with expanding the role and importance of the reliever in professional baseball beginning in the 1970s.

==Early life and career==
Lyle was born in DuBois, Pennsylvania, on July 22, 1944, and grew up in nearby Reynoldsville. His father was a carpenter and general contractor, and his mother a seamstress at a coffin factory. He attended Reynoldsville High School where he played varsity football and basketball. During the spring of his junior year, he began playing American Legion baseball for the DuBois team because neither his high school nor Reynoldsville fielded an organized baseball squad.

He struck out 31 batters while pitching 14 of 17 innings in a state tournament game for DuBois. At the time, his pitching repertoire consisted of a fastball, curveball and changeup. He was brought in for a tryout with the Pittsburgh Pirates alongside Bruce Dal Canton. The Pirates signed only the latter after seeing that the speed of Lyle&#x27;s pitches was no match for Dal Canton&#x27;s. Lyle did succeed in catching the attention of George Staller who was a scout for the Baltimore Orioles at the time. Lyle signed with the ballclub as an amateur free agent on June 17, 1964.

He spent the opening half of his first professional campaign in 1964 with the Bluefield Orioles. He appeared in seven games, three out of the bullpen. It was the first time he was used as a reliever, an idea which he suggested to manager Jim Frey. Later that season, he would earn a promotion to the Fox Cities Foxes, where he was used exclusively as a starting pitcher in six games for the eventual Midwest League champions.

==Boston Red Sox==
Lyle was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first-year draft on November 30, 1964. He progressed up the Red Sox farm system as a relief pitcher, with stops in Winston-Salem in 1965, Pittsfield in 1966 and Toronto in the first half of 1967. It was during his time at Pittsfield that he picked up the slider, a pitch that was introduced to him by Ted Williams at spring training prior to that season. Lyle recalled, &quot;He told me it was the best pitch in baseball because it was the only pitch he couldn&#x27;t hit even when he knew it was coming.&quot; The slider became the most successful pitch in his repertoire.

He was called up to Boston after Dennis Bennett was sold to the New York Mets on June 24, 1967. Lyle pitched two scoreless innings to close out a 4–3 Red Sox loss to the California Angels in his major-league debut at Anaheim Stadium on July 4. He recorded his first career save twelve days later on July 16 in Boston&#x27;s 9–5 victory over the Detroit Tigers at Fenway Park. His first win in the majors came on July 27 in the Red Sox&#x27;s ten-inning 6–5 triumph at home over the Angels. He ended his rookie campaign with 27 mound appearances, a 1–2 record, five saves and a 2.28 earned run average (ERA). He was left off Boston&#x27;s World Series roster due to a sore arm.

He registered 64 saves during the next four years, serving as the team&#x27;s closer from 1969 to 1971.

==New York Yankees==
During spring training prior to the 1972 season on March 22, Lyle was traded to the New York Yankees for Danny Cater and a player to be named later (Mario Guerrero). The transaction proved to be one-sided as Lyle became the Yankees&#x27; bullpen ace, establishing himself as one of the best relief pitchers of the 1970s. He played a major role in the Yankees&#x27; three straight pennants from 1976 to 1978, and World Series titles in the last two of those years. In 1972, he saved 35 games, an American League record, and a major league record for left-handers; Ron Perranoski had set both marks in 1970, but John Hiller would surpass Lyle&#x27;s total with 38 in 1973. In 1972, Lyle also became the first southpaw to collect 100 saves in the American League. He also finished third in the 1972 MVP voting.

Lyle again led the league in saves in 1976, and in 1977 became the first AL reliever to win the Cy Young Award. He was named an American League All-Star in 1973, 1976 and 1977. In 1976, he broke Hoyt Wilhelm&#x27;s American League record of 154 career saves, and the following year eclipsed Perranoski&#x27;s major league mark for left-handers of 179 career saves. Through 1977, Lyle had compiled 201 career saves, and was within range of Wilhelm&#x27;s career big-league record of 227. Lyle was associated with a trademark song to herald his entry into games, &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D&quot;.

But despite Lyle&#x27;s 1977 Cy Young Award, the Yankees decided to upgrade the closer position in the 1977 off-season. To this end they signed Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; reliever Rich Gossage, who had been an All-Star the previous three years and had led the American League in saves while with the Chicago White Sox in 1975. Gossage was a power pitcher as opposed to Lyle&#x27;s more slider-based approach and could throw his fastball much harder than Lyle could, at or near 100 MPH on a consistent basis. Although Lyle was not opposed to the Yankees&#x27; move, he later said that they should have gotten rid of him after they signed Gossage. Lyle knew the 26-year-old Gossage was a rising star who would eventually become the go-to reliever, and Lyle was not okay with a reduced role in the Yankees&#x27; bullpen.

During the 1978 season, working mostly in middle relief appearances, Lyle appeared in 59 games and recorded nine saves, most of which were early in the season. He also posted a 9-3 record out of the bullpen, but posted his second-highest earned run average. Lyle suffered a varicose vein flareup in his pelvic area. Yankees teammate Graig Nettles quipped that Lyle went &quot;from Cy Young to sayonara.&quot;

During the course of the season, Lyle expressed a desire to leave the Yankees. One of Lyle&#x27;s desired destinations was the Texas Rangers, and he believed that a deal would be done &quot;before Christmas&quot;. On November 10, 1978, the Yankees traded him to the Rangers along with catcher Mike Heath, pitchers Larry McCall and Dave Rajsich, and minor league shortstop Domingo Ramos in exchange for outfielder Juan Beníquez, pitchers Mike Griffin, Paul Mirabella, and Dave Righetti, and minor league outfielder Greg Jemison. $400,000 in cash was paid to the Rangers.

==Later career==
Lyle signed a contract with the Rangers shortly after he was acquired, with the intention of him finishing his playing career in Texas. However, Lyle was not the same pitcher he had been in his All-Star years and it showed. He split closer duties with Jim Kern his first year in Texas and only managed thirteen saves. Lyle also posted eight losses against five wins. He was nearly dealt along with Johnny Grubb from the Rangers to the Philadelphia Phillies for Tug McGraw, Bake McBride and Larry Christenson at the 1979 Winter Meetings in Toronto, but the proposed transaction was never executed because, although Lyle did not have a no-trade clause negotiated into the deal he had signed after being traded to the Rangers, the two sides had agreed to defer a total of $500,000 that was to be paid to him over ten years as his salary for becoming an analyst on the team&#x27;s television broadcasts once Lyle retired and they could not strike an agreement regarding that.

In 1980, Lyle only recorded eight saves. Entering the season as one of two contenders to break Hoyt Wilhelm&#x27;s career saves record, he was caught and passed by Rollie Fingers early in the year on Fingers&#x27; way to setting a new mark himself.

Lyle was dealt to the Phillies on September 13 in a transaction that was completed when Kevin Saucier was sent to the Rangers two months later on November 19. Since he was acquired after the deadline for postseason eligibility, he did not pitch for the Phillies during the National League Championship Series nor the 1980 World Series. All the news was not positive, however, as for the first time in his career Lyle recorded an ERA above 4.00. In 1981 he saw more of the same, recording only two saves in 49 games with a 4.44 ERA and a 9-6 record.

His contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox from the Phillies on August 21, 1982. He played his last game on September 27. He was released by the White Sox on October 12, 1982. Lyle finished his 16-year career with 238 saves, a 2.88 ERA, and a record of 99–76 in 899 games pitched — all in relief. In 1985, Fingers broke his American League record for career saves; and in 1991 Righetti surpassed Lyle&#x27;s major-league record for career saves by a left-hander, though Lyle still holds the AL mark of 232.

==Post-playing years==
In 1998, Lyle became the first manager of the Somerset Patriots, an independent baseball league team based in Bridgewater, New Jersey. He managed the team to Atlantic League pennants in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2009, and was the Patriots&#x27; manager until November 27, 2012, when he became manager emeritus.
Lyle&#x27;s number 28 that he wore with the Patriots was retired on June 14, 2014.

==Clubhouse antics==
A noted clubhouse prankster in his playing days, Lyle was known for sneaking into the locker room during games to sit naked on birthday cakes prepared for teammates, leaving the imprint of his posterior on the frosting. In his autobiography, Lyle noted that teammate Ron Swoboda turned the tables on him by defecating on a cake which was then delivered to Lyle; Lyle said the reason why he eventually stopped his cake sitting was because of the notoriety he gained from doing it, thinking that someone might try to &quot;put a needle in the cake&quot; to hurt him.

As a world-class practical joker, Lyle engaged in creative pranks like putting goldfish in the dugout water cooler and ordering pizzas to be delivered to the other team&#x27;s bullpen. Once, he got revenge on Yogi Berra for using his toothpaste before games by injecting liniment into the tube; Lyle said that once the liniment came in contact with Berra&#x27;s mouth it literally caused smoke to pour from his gums.

He loved giving &quot;hotfoots&quot;, a time-honored baseball trick where a player will sneak up on another player or reporter while they are giving an interview in the dugout. The unsuspecting victim then has a match or two placed gently in the back or side of their shoe, with the head facing out. When the moment is right, the prankster lights the match head and slinks away to watch from a distance. As soon as the flame from the slowly burning head reaches the victim’s shoe, it’s hot enough to be felt. Lyle enjoyed the final result, usually a startled yelp in the middle of a serious conversation.

<doc id="629277" wikidata="Q4897707" url="?curid=629277" title="Bethany, Ontario">
<text>Bethany is an unincorporated village in the Canadian province of Ontario, within the single-tier municipality of Kawartha Lakes. Bethany is centred on Highway 7A. It is located a few kilometers west of Peterborough, the largest city in the area.

It is a gateway community, where since 2000 there has been significant real-estate development, mostly in the form of individual dwellings. To the north are downhill and cross-country ski areas, mostly accessible by paved county roads.

==History==
By 1869, Bethany was a village with a population of 300 in the Township of Manvers, then part of Durham County. It was a station of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway. Since a stream passing through the village afforded power for machinery, it was a good position for a foundry, agricultural implement works and a tannery. The average cost of improved lands was $35 per acre while wild lands were valued at $23.
== Services ==

=== Library ===
Bethany Public Library is part of the City of Kawartha Lakes Public Library System, which offers computer access as well as ongoing free programs. The library is in the same building as the municipal offices.

=== Sub post office ===
Bethany sub post office, part of Canada Post, offers post office boxes in the IDA Drug Mart

=== Schools ===
Most Bethany students attend schools which are part of the Trillium Lakelands District School Board. Most students in grades Junior Kindergarten to 3 attend Grandview Public School. Students in Grades 4 - 8 attend Rolling Hills Public School. Highschool students are bussed to I.E.Weldon Secondary School.

== Celebrations ==
The town has annual celebrations throughout the summer, particularly on the May 24 Victoria Day long-weekend. Put on by the Bethany Athletic Society, responsible for maintaining the community park, and youth sports. Highlights of the Victoria Day weekend include the Classic Car show (started in 1990), Tractor pulls (started in 2005), Fireworks, Beef BBQ and the all ages Dances.

<text>Domingos Martins is the name of a municipality in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo. According to the IBGE, the municipality had 33,986 inhabitants. It has a population density of 25.9 inhabitants/km2.

==Geography==
Domingos Martins is approximately 60 km west of the state capital, Vitória, and is 542 meters above sea level. Bordering municipalities include Castelo, Venda Nova do Imigrante and Afonso Claudio to the west, Santa Maria de Jetiba and Santa Leopoldina to the north, Cariacica and Viana to the east, and Guarapari, Marechal Floriano, Alfredo Chaves and Vargem Alta to the south. The municipality itself is again subdivided into 5 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;): Capital (&quot;Sede&quot; in Portuguese), Aracê, Santa Isabel, Parajú and Melgaço. The total area occupied by the municipality is 1,225.327 km2.

It is in the mountainous region of the state and is marketed as the &quot;Green City&quot;, since it is surrounded by subtropical rainforest, much of which has disappeared in the rest of the region. Within its borders lie mountains of up to 2000m, amongst which is the well-known Pedra Azul State Park consisting mainly of a quartzite rock jutting out of the surrounding landscape at 1,822m above sea level. It has a blue tinge to the stone due to the kind of lichens which grow on it, which gives the name to the formation and the park.

==History==

This town was founded in 1893 and was then known as Campinho. Part of the colony of Santa Isabel, it was first a secondary district but soon outgrew its capital and took the title of capital from it later on. Domingos Martins acquired its present name on 20 December 1921, given in honour of Domingos José Martins who fought in the Pernambucan revolt in 1817, when the region sought independence from Brazil. He was accused of treason and executed in Salvador on 12 June 1817.

The Lutheran-Confessional Evangelical Church in the town square (&quot;Praça&quot; Arthur Gerhardt-Square) was founded on 20 May 1866 and is considered the first evangelical church in Brazil to have a bell tower, as at that time only Catholic churches were permitted to build bell towers. A salient feature in the history of the municipality is the presence of Pomeranian immigrants, who came from a region that is now part of Germany and Poland. This population often finds itself in difficult-to-access areas, and many still speak East Pomeranian, though today it is thought to be extinct in their homeland.
==Demographics==
&quot;Source: IBGE 2010. &quot;

==Economy==

Because it was colonized mainly by Germanic immigrants, Domingos Martins still has characteristically Germanic architecture and cuisine. This makes it a top tourist destination for Capixabas. Both tourism and agriculture are important to this municipality. The capital also holds the headquarters of a soft drink factory, &quot;Refrigerantes Coroa&quot;, as well as a few small-scale biscuit factories which borrow their recipes from their Germanic ancestors.

<doc id="629288" wikidata="Q567786" url="?curid=629288" title="The Cure (The Cure album)">
<text>The Cure is the twelfth studio album by English rock band of the same name, released on 25 June 2004 by Geffen Records. The album was entirely co-produced by American producer Ross Robinson and frontman Robert Smith and spawned the single &quot;The End of the World&quot;.

== Production and content ==

Robinson had previously worked with rock and heavy metal bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, At the Drive-In, Glassjaw and the Blood Brothers. This may have contributed to the songs on the album being heavier than previous material by the band. Smith described the record as &quot;Cure heavy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;new-metal heavy&quot;.

Robinson said The Cure&#x27;s usual process was to first create the music and Smith would later bring the lyrics. He said he encouraged Smith to write the lyrics first instead. That way the rest of the band could put the feeling expressed into the music they played.

Twenty songs were created during the recording sessions. However, Robinson suggest a different sequencing; Smith explained:

Robinson insisted on the group playing together while recording songs, like a live experience. Bassist Simon Gallup did not enjoy working with Robinson, believing that he was &quot;contriving to be eccentric&quot;.

According to the liner notes, the entire album was recorded live in the studio. Smith said the official track listing includes the closing &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;, which was excluded from North American pressings.

The artwork was designed by Smith&#x27;s nephews and nieces: children who were unaware that their drawings were to be put on the album. The drawings were supposed to be of a &#x27;good dream&#x27; and a &#x27;bad dream&#x27; from each niece and nephew. Smith compiled the best drawings on the album and then produced it.

Robert Smith said in 2024 in an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music presenter Matt Everitt that the album was his least favourite &quot;&quot;The Cure&quot; album is probably my least favourite album that we’ve made. I don&#x27;t like some of it, it&#x27;s the only album that I don’t think works.&quot; but also said his favourite song from the album was &quot;Before Three&quot;&quot;.&quot;

== Promotion ==
&quot;The Cure&quot; is the first record by the band released by producer Ross Robinson&#x27;s I Am label, with whom the Cure signed a three-album deal. To promote the album, the band appeared at several festivals in Europe and the United States in spring 2004. They also premièred the song &quot;The End of the World&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In the summer of 2004, the band launched the Curiosa festival, where they performed shows across the United States with a number of bands who have been inspired by the Cure, including Mogwai, Interpol and Muse. The band then performed in Mexico, followed by additional festivals and televised performances in Europe, culminating with the end of 2004. By the end of the year, every song from &quot;The Cure&quot; had been performed live by the band.

== Release ==
&quot;The Cure&quot; was first released in Japan on 25 June 2004. It was then released in the UK and Europe on 28 June and then in the US the day after. It debuted at No. 7 in the United States, selling 91,000 copies in its first week of release, and No. 8 in the United Kingdom.

Initial pressings included a bonus DVD containing a documentary of the conception of three songs from the album, titled &quot;Making &#x27;The Cure&quot;&#x27;.

Demos of three songs recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, titled &quot;A Boy I Never Knew&quot;, &quot;Please Come Home&quot; and &quot;Strum&quot;, have leaked as MP3 files. 

== Reception ==
Critical response to &quot;The Cure&quot; has been generally positive. Metacritic calculated the weighted average score given to &quot;The Cure&quot; at 75 out of 100. Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as a &quot;masterful performance all round&quot;, highlighting the songs &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;Going Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Anniversary&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot;. Rob Fitzpatrick of &quot;NME&quot; described it as &quot;startling from the first listen. &quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;it&#x27;s the grooviest thing, it&#x27;s a perfect dream&quot;, and pointed out the album&#x27;s highlights as being &quot;Before Three&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Know What&#x27;s Going) On&quot;. While stating that &quot;as with Prince on &quot;Musicology&quot;, Smith allows the Cure&#x27;s current lineup to become his own tribute band&quot;, David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; nonetheless concluded that the &quot;newly vibrant music looks back lovingly as well on a time when Cure songs managed to combine a throbbing, oingo-boingo springiness with the depressive angst of suburban-basement isolation&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine was mixed in his review of &quot;The Cure&quot;, qualifying it as &quot;the type of record that sits on the shelves of diehard fans, only occasionally making its way on the stereo&quot;. Andy Greenwald of &quot;Blender&quot; felt that the band &quot;come off more than ever like a caricature&quot;, writing: &quot;There are a few breaks of sunlight, including the single &#x27;The End of the World&#x27; and &#x27;Taking Off&#x27;, a strummy echo of 1992&#x27;s chart-topping &quot;Wish&quot;. After that, it&#x27;s right back into the abyss.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Andy Gill panned the album as being &quot;just as stunted musically as emotionally, the bleak chordings and grey washes barely differing throughout, whatever an individual song&#x27;s outlook.&quot;

== Track listing ==
All lyrics written by Robert Smith; all music by the Cure (Smith, Perry Bamonte, Simon Gallup, Jason Cooper and Roger O&#x27;Donnell).

==Playing career==
Ward was born in Sutton Coldfield and began his career with Aston Villa before moving on to Shrewsbury Town. He failed to make an appearance for either club and left for West Bromwich Albion where he made his professional debut in a League Cup match against Bradford City. He then moved to Cardiff City where he finally found regular football becoming a regular in the 1991–92 season and helped the &quot;Bluebirds&quot; win the Division Three title in 1992–93.

He made over 60 league and cup appearances for Cardiff in four seasons before moving to Leicester City for a transfer fee of £175,000 in 1993 where he help them to win promotion to the Premier League in 1994. After leaving Leicester he had a short spell at Bradford City before Bolton Wanderers paid £300,000 for his services in 1996, allowing Ward to again taste top-flight action. He spent three seasons at the Reebok Stadium acting as back-up to Keith Branagan. He spent the first half of the 1998–99 season on loan at Burnley before joining Stoke City on a permanent basis in March 1998. He instantly established himself as first choice at the Britannia Stadium and he played in all 60 of the club&#x27;s fixtures during a hectic 1999–2000 season which saw Stoke win the Football League Trophy and reach the play-offs as Stoke lost controversially to Gillingham. He was second choice at Stoke in 2000–01 and 2001–02 and joined Walsall in the summer of 2002.

After spells at Walsall, Coventry City, Barnsley and Preston North End he joined Tranmere Rovers in June 2006. Ward made a bright start to the 2006–07, even managing to score a goal, which came from a free kick just outside his box in the 9th minute against Leyton Orient on 2 September 2006. 
He was released by Tranmere in May 2007 and made the short journey to Chester, where he was backup and coach to John Danby. Ward&#x27;s only competitive appearance for Chester was as a half-time substitute for the injured Danby against Crewe Alexandra in the Football League Trophy on 4 September 2007, with Chester going on to win a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. On 8 January 2008, Ward moved to arch-rivals Wrexham on a free transfer. He played in over 50 matches for the club before being released at the end of the 2008–09 season. Ward went on to play for Hednesford Town during the 2008–09 season.

==Coaching career==
Following the appointment of Brian Little as manager of Gainsborough Trinity, Ward was appointed Assistant Manager, as well as signing on as the club&#x27;s reserve goalkeeper.

Ward retired from playing at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 18 July 2011, he left his post at Gainsborough to become Goalkeeping Coach at Shrewsbury Town. He was registered as a player after second-choice goalkeeper Joe Anyon picked up an injury in October 2012, with Ward taking his place on the bench.

On 4 July 2013, Ward agreed to be Goalkeeping Coach at Nottingham Forest.

<doc id="629310" wikidata="Q6135006" url="?curid=629310" title="Succasunna, New Jersey">
<text>Succasunna is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Roxbury Township, Morris County, New Jersey, United States, serving as the township&#x27;s downtown and population center. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 10,338, up from 9,152 in 2010.

==History==
The name &quot;Succasunna&quot; comes from the Lenni Lenape Native American word for &quot;land of black stones&quot;, most likely due to the rich iron ore deposits in the area. The community was established circa 1740.

The Morris Canal was an important transportation link in the iron industry around Succasunna, carrying coal to iron-ore producing areas all over northern New Jersey. The canal was abandoned in 1924 and largely dismantled.

Succasunna was the site of the world&#x27;s first electronic switching public telephone exchange. The Western Electric model 1ESS system was cut over for service on the New Jersey Bell 584 central office on May 30, 1965. A commemorative plaque on the wall of the central office building notes this historic event. Instead of electro-mechanical relays, the 1ESS was the first commercial computerized electronic switching system. This innovation allowed for features of modern telephone service, like call forwarding, call waiting, and three-way calling.

==Geography==
Succasunna is in western Morris County and occupies the southern portion of Roxbury Township. It is bordered to the northwest by Ledgewood and to the northeast by Kenvil, both in Roxbury Township.

New Jersey Route 10 passes through the northeast part of Succasunna, leading northwest to its terminus at U.S. Route 46 in Ledgewood and east to Whippany. The Morristown and Erie Railway runs rail freight service through the area two to five times per week on its High Bridge Branch.

<text>Boss is a manufacturer of effects pedals for electric guitar and bass guitar. It is a division of the Roland Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer that specializes in musical equipment and accessories. For many years Boss has manufactured a wide range of products related to effects processing for guitars, including &quot;compact&quot; and &quot;twin&quot; effects pedals, multi-effect pedals, electronic tuners and pedal boards. In more recent times, Boss expanded their product range by including digital studios, rhythm machines, samplers and other electronic music equipment. They also are now manufacturing solid-state amplifiers and speaker heads such as the Waza and the Katana. Both feature multi-effects units meant to emulate Boss&#x27; classic effects pedals.

==History==
The earliest Boss product was called &quot;B-100 The Boss&quot;, released in 1974. This came with a clip-on pre-amp and a pickup to amplify acoustic guitars. At this point the Boss company had not been formed and it was still a Beckmen Musical Instruments product (as seen on the B-100 box). The first proper Boss foot pedal effect, the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, was released June 1976, which was a stand-alone unit of the chorus/vibrato circuit found in the Roland JC-120 amplifier. It was a fairly large, AC-powered unit. Other foot pedals of that year are the GE-10 (a graphic equalizer), the BF-1 (a flanger unit) and the DB-5 (a distortion unit).

Boss&#x27;s line of compact pedals began in 1977 with the release of six pedals, all of them discontinued: an overdrive pedal (OD-1), a phaser pedal (PH-1), a parametric equalizer called the Spectrum (SP-1), a 6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), a compressor pedal (CS-1) and an automatic wah pedal (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 was released the next year, in 1978. Their first compact chorus pedal (CE-2) came in 1979, and their first flanger pedal (BF-2) in 1980. In 1983 Boss released the DD-2 Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact pedal format. The Metal Zone (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992 Boss released nine new pedals, including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2). The Heavy Metal (HM-2) distortion pedal was an integral part of the guitar sound of many styles of heavy metal music ever since. The pedals all share the same &#x27;footprint&#x27;, for compatibility with pedal boards.

Boss introduced COSM (Composite Object Sound Modeling), Roland&#x27;s proprietary version of digital modeling technology, into their AC-3 Acoustic Simulator pedal in 2006. Boss has since released several pedals using COSM, including the FBM-1 &#x27;59 Fender Bassman pedal and FDR-1 &#x27;65 Fender Deluxe Reverb pedal, introduced at the Winter NAMM show in January 2007.

All Boss compact pedals use a &quot;buffered bypass&quot; type of silent foot switching utilizing Field Effect Transistors (FETs) to avoid clicks and pops. While not &quot;true&quot; bypass, the buffered bypass has the advantage of preventing signal loss due to long runs of cable, while keeping original guitar tone intact.

==Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia==

Boss compact pedals were originally produced in Japan, until circa 1990 when production moved to Taiwan. Earlier units came with a metal screw securing the battery compartment; later models retained the metal screw, adding a plastic knob for tool-less battery removal. The labels on the bottom of the pedals come in several different colours including black, silver, green, pink and blue. Apart from this the basic external design has remained unchanged for almost half a century.

The DS-1 Distortion circuit design has changed significantly twice throughout its lifetime; the first time was around 1994 when the Toshiba TA7136AP op-amp was replaced with a Rohm BA728N. In 2000 the op-amp was again changed. This time it was replaced with the Mitsubishi M5223AL. The latest op-amp change occurred in 2007, when new DS-1 pedals began shipping with the NJM3404AL op-amp.

In 2014, Boss released the Japanese-made &quot;Waza-Craft&quot; line of premium pedals, built with higher-end components featuring reissues of highly sought after vintage Boss effects such as the DM-2W Analog Delay, CE-2W Analog Chorus and DC-2W Dimension C. &quot;Waza&quot; means &quot;art&quot; and &quot;technique&quot; in Japanese.

In 2017 Boss released the 500 series pedals as their flagship design, complete with digital display and preset banks, similar to the design of Strymon pedals featuring presets, programmable algorithms and customizable midi options.

In 2019, Boss discontinued the twin format 20 series pedals and replaced the line with the 200 series.

As of 2019 around the launch of the DD3T and DD8 Digital Delays, Boss moved production from Taiwan to Malaysia. The Malaysian black label on the bottom looks similar to the modern era Taiwan label, verifying the new location of manufacturing.

==Notable pedals==
===BD-2 Blues Driver===
In 1995, Boss released the BD-2, an overdrive pedal aimed at blues players who sought to add distortion while maintaining their amp&#x27;s signal clarity and dynamics. At the time, blues was experiencing a resurgence thanks to Eric Clapton and Gary Moore. The pedal has a clear, punchy tone and features a flatter EQ-curve for a more amp-like tone than similar pedals, like the Ibanez Tube Screamer.

Notable players who use the BD-2 include Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day.

===CE-1 Chorus Ensemble===

Boss released its first pedal, the CE-1, in 1975 after the &quot;chorus&quot; effect proved popular among guitarists with its use in the JC-120 and JC-60 Jazz Chorus amplifiers, released by Boss&#x27;s parent company Roland Corporation. The pedal was housed in a large enclosure, typical for effects at the time, and featured two footswitches for on/off and to toggle between the unit&#x27;s vibrato and chorus effects. The pedal worked in mono and stereo, and its &quot;thick, spatial, and multidimensional&quot; quality inspired numerous other companies to copy the pedal. With the introduction of Boss&#x27;s compact pedal format in 1977, the CE-1 was replaced by the CE-2 in 1979.

Andy Summers of The Police was a notable fan, using the pedal on songs like &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close To Me.&quot;

===DD-3 Digital Delay===
In the early &#x27;80s, Boss was able to fit the circuitry of its best-selling SDE-3000 digital rack delay into the form factor of its analog DM-2 delay, branded as the DD-2 digital delay. A subsequent drop in component costs allowed the pedal to be sold for a lower price in 1986 as the rebranded DD-3, which has gone through three distinct versions, with latest still in production. Music Radar dubbed the DD-3 the &quot;gold standard&quot; in compact digital delays and fans include Radiohead, Blur, and The Cult.

===DS-1 Distortion===
Introduced in 1978, the DS-1 was Boss&#x27;s first distortion pedal, and second pedal release overall, following the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble. The DS-1 uses two hard-clipping diodes for an aggressive edge, similar to the ProCo Rat, released the same year. This type of circuit became known as &quot;distortion,&quot; as opposed to the soft-clipping &quot;overdrive&quot; of Boss&#x27;s later overdrive pedals. The DS-1 uses a preamplifier instead of the conventional op-amp for a gritty, warm tone. When the original Toshiba TA7136AP preamp became scarce, the circuit was redesigned in 1994, introducing several &quot;quirks&quot;—lower volume levels, noise at higher gain levels, and a &quot;waspy&quot; edge due to higher frequencies not being filtered out. These issues led to the pedal being popular among modifiers.

The DS-1 is Boss&#x27;s bestselling pedal of all time.

===MT-2 Metal Zone===
The Metal Zone was released in 1991, following the discontinuation of the earlier HM-2 Heavy Metal, which failed to sell well during its production run, but was popular among death metal players, since amplifiers of the time were not capable of the amount of distortion players wanted without being boosted with a pedal. With the MT-2, Boss sought to appeal to that market with an improved pedal as death metal&#x27;s popularity surged. The MT-2 sported a complex design for a distortion pedal, with a dual-stage gain circuit, seven filters for both pre- and post-distortion, and a semi-parametric three-band EQ section. The pedal&#x27;s thick, saturated, tight tone and the extreme sounds the pedal was able to produce thanks to its powerful EQ controls made the MT-2 divisive both upon its release and throughout its ongoing production. &quot;Guitar World&quot; characterized the general reaction to the pedal as &quot;inspiring or confusing,&quot; and the pedal is often lampooned on the internet as the worst distortion ever made. Many in the metal community embraced the sound, however, with Nathan Weaver of Wolves in the Throne Room favorably describing the MT-2 as a &quot;fucked-up, corpse-grinding type sound.&quot; Despite this, the pedal has found fans like Prince when used on lower gain settings or as a boost. 

The Metal Zone has sold over a million units, making it the company&#x27;s best-selling pedal behind only the DS-1. In 2021, Boss released a grey-on-black variant, the MT-2-3A, celebrating the pedal&#x27;s 30 years in production.

===OD-1 OverDrive===

With the 1977 release of the OD-1 OverDrive, Boss coined the term &quot;overdrive,&quot; a reference to the pedal&#x27;s asymmetrical-clipping, tube-like distortion in comparison to the brash sound of &quot;fuzz&quot; pedals available. The OD-1&#x27;s layout was simple—with only &quot;Level&quot; and &quot;OverDrive&quot; controls. The OD-1 was an immediate success, as the pedal afforded players more amp-like distortion at lower volume levels no matter what amp was being used. Within a few years, however, the pedal&#x27;s voicing was considered overly &quot;sweet&quot; as rock music became more aggressive and the fixed frequency limited its versatility. With the surging popularity of the OD-1-influenced Ibanez Tube Screamer and its addition of a tone control, Boss began including a &quot;Tone&quot; knob on its pedals with the 1981 SD-1 and the OD-1 was discontinued in 1985.

Boss continued the OverDrive line with the four-knob OD-2 Turbo OverDrive, produced from 1985 to 1995, and subsequently the three-knob OD-3, which is still in production.

===SD-1 Super OverDrive===
The Super OverDrive was released in 1981 as Boss&#x27;s second overdrive pedal, adding a tone control to the earlier OD-1 design, while continuing to replicate the sound of tube amp-style overdrive via an asymmetrical clipping circuit and an inherent midrange-focus, but with less bass roll-off. The asymmetrical clipping lent the pedal a more aggressive character compared to the rival Tube Screamer, and it became popular in the growing hard rock and heavy metal subgenres with guitarists frequently using it to boost already-overdriven amplifiers like the Marshall JCM800 into higher-gain sounds.

The SD-1 has long been popular as an affordable pedal for new players, as well as professionals. Notable fans include Jimmy Page, John Frusciante, Josh Homme, Jonny Greenwood, David Gilmour, Joe Satriani, Zakk Wylde, The Edge, and Prince.

In 2021, Boss released a 40th anniversary edition of the pedal, with the original circuit having remained unchanged since its introduction. &quot;Guitar&quot; dubbed the pedal one of only a handful to ever achieve &quot;truly iconic status.&quot;

<text>The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs was briefly an office of Her Majesty&#x27;s government in the United Kingdom. It was established by Harold Wilson in October 1964. Wilson had been impressed by the six-week experiment of a Minister for Economic Affairs in 1947, an office occupied by Stafford Cripps before he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer. The office was revived for eight months in 1950 and held by Hugh Gaitskell. After a Conservative victory at the 1951 election, Winston Churchill also appointed a Minister of Economic Affairs, Arthur Salter, in the period 1951–52.
Wilson&#x27;s advisers Patrick Blackett and Thomas Balogh advised him to create a new ministry, to be called the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), in order to drive through his economic plan. Wilson wanted to divide the functions of the Treasury in two, in part to reduce its power. The DEA was to undertake long-term planning of the economy and industry, while the Treasury would determine short-term revenue raising and financial management. The DEA was therefore tasked with the preparation of a National Plan for the economy, which was published in September 1965.

Critics of Wilson&#x27;s approach, including Douglas Jay, suspected the main reason for the Department was to appease George Brown, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. The (true) story told at the time, that Brown finally accepted the job while riding in a taxi with Wilson, tended to lend credence to this analysis.

Under Brown, the Department had a reasonable degree of influence. However, Brown was moved to the Foreign Office in August 1966, and the two succeeding secretaries of state were not of his rank. The Treasury was able to claw back its power, and the Department had become moribund long before it was wound up in 1969.

The DEA was the model for the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in the television series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

<text>Rodgers Instruments Corporation is an American manufacturer of classical and church organs. Rodgers was incorporated May 1, 1958 in Beaverton, Oregon by founders, Rodgers W. Jenkins and Fred Tinker, employees of Tektronix, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, and members of a Tektronix team developing transistor-based oscillator circuits. Rodgers was the second manufacturer of solid state oscillator-based organs, completing their first instrument in 1958 (the first was the Gulbransen &quot;B&quot; home organ, introduced in July 1957. Both the Rodgers and the Gulbransen had vacuum-tube amplifiers. In 1962, upon introducing solid-state amplifiers, Rodgers became the world&#x27;s first all-transistor organ). Other Rodgers innovations in the electronic organ industry include solid-state organ amplifiers (1962), single-contact diode keying (1961), reed switch pedal keying for pedalboards (1961), programmable computer memory pistons (1966), and the first MIDI-supported church organs (1986).

Rodgers&#x27; manufacturing facility and world headquarters is located in Hillsboro, Oregon. All Rodgers organs are built in the Oregon factory.

On January 4, 2016, Roland Corporation agreed to the Dutch Vandeweerd family’s acquisition of the American company Rodgers Instruments, effective January 15, 2016. The Vandeweerd family (Global Organ Group) already owned three other organ brands: Johannus, Makin and Copeman Hart.

==Technology==
Rodgers&#x27; success was largely due to their early innovations with solid state analog tone generation technology. Despite the fact that competitors such as Allen switched to digitally synthesized tone generation as early as 1971, Rodgers sold exclusively analog tone generation instruments until 1990.

Rodgers introduced its first digital organ on November 20, 1990, using a tone generation system Rodgers has dubbed Parallel Digital Imaging (PDI). Rodgers PDI organs use Roland DSPs and digitally sampled organ pipes for tone generation.

A feature introduced in 1993, which Rodgers has termed &quot;Digital Domain Expression,&quot; offers swell box effects such as expression delays, high frequency damping and phase shifts of sound across a stereo field as expression shoes are opened or closed, similar to the effects produced by the swell shades on a pipe organ&#x27;s swell box.

In 2014, Rodgers new Infinity II models introduced Bluetooth wireless controls, including support for reading music from an iPad.

==Pipe organs==
Although known primarily for its electronic organs, Rodgers has built many pipe organs and pipe/electronic combination organs.

Many Rodgers organs support the playing of actual pipe ranks in addition to their normal, electronic ranks. The first electronic organ to successfully integrate pipes and electronic tone generation was a Rodgers Gemini with Fratelli Ruffatti organ pipes installed in the Atlanta area home of Dr. Walter and Emily Spivey. It included a tuning control so the pipes and electronics could stay in tune with each other.

The largest full pipe organ produced by the company was the Second Baptist Church Houston, Texas organ with five manuals and 187 pipe ranks. It was dedicated on August 23, 1987 and featured concerts on August 23 and 24th by organist Frederick Swann. In addition, it was the featured organ of the 1988 Houston National Convention of the American Guild of Organists where it was played by organist Diane Bish. However, the organ’s console was offered for sale on eBay in 2015 and the instrument is no longer used.

In August 1991, another large all-pipe Rodgers organ installed at Glenkirk Presbyterian Church, Glendora, California was the cover feature of The American Organist, official journal of the American Guild of Organists.

==Corporate affiliations==

Originally controlled by officers of Tektronix and the founding engineers, in September 1977, Rodgers became part of CBS Musical Instruments along with Steinway &amp; Sons pianos, Fender guitars, Rhodes electric pianos, Gemeinhardt flutes, and a number of other instrument brand names. In 1985 CBS, divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by Steinway Musical Properties. Beginning May 1, 1988, Roland Corporation became the &quot;parent company&quot; of Rodgers, and Rodgers its subsidiary. This lasted until 2015. In addition to its own Rodgers organs, Rodgers produced Atelier home organs and Roland Classic C-330 and C-380 organs designed for home studios. As of January 4, 2016, Vandeweerd (Owner of Johannus) has been the &quot;parent company&quot; of Rodgers.

==Touring organs==

Organist Virgil Fox helped bring Rodgers organs into the limelight in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he used a Rodgers Touring Organ, built in 1966 and known as &quot;Black Beauty,&quot; for his &quot;Heavy Organ&quot; concerts, including a 1970 all Bach performance that included a light show at the Fillmore East Auditorium in New York City.

On October 1, 1974, Rodgers’ five manual Carnegie Hall organ, designed by Virgil Fox, debuted in a sold-out Fox concert. The organ and Fox were praised by Time, United Press International, Ron Eyer in the New York Daily News, New York Post and by noted critic Harold Schonberg in The New York Times. Carnegie Hall’s International Organ Series for the Inaugural 1974-1975 Season included Fox, Pierre Cochereau, Claire Coci, Fernando Germani, Herman Berlinski, George Thalben-Ball and Richard Morris. This was the world’s first five manual and most powerful electronic organ at the time and was listed as such for a number of years in the Guinness Book of World Records.

A sister five manual instrument to the Carnegie Hall Organ, named by Fox the &quot;Royal V&quot;, served as Fox&#x27;s touring organ for the 1975-76 concert season, but proved unwieldy to tour with. The Royal V was used at Fox&#x27;s funeral in the Crystal Cathedral after he died on October 25, 1980.

A second black Rodgers touring organ was active in the 1970s. The &quot;American Beauty&quot; was based on Rodgers&#x27;s then premium three manual model, the &quot;American Classic&quot;. Concert organists who played on this instrument or &quot;Black Beauty&quot; (which continued touring under Roberta Bailey Artists International well into the 80s) included Ted Alan Worth, Joyce Jones, Pierre Cochereau, Herman Berlinski, Richard Morris, Keith Chapman, Douglas Marshall, John Grady, Frederick Geoghan, William S. Wrenn, Jr., and Diane Bish.

The Royal V was, in 1983, refinished from black to white and permanently installed in the Meishusama Hall of the Shinji Shumeikai in Minsono, Japan. In mid-2004, this same organ was updated to newer Rodgers technology. Dan Miller and McNeill Robinson, consultants on the project, revised and updated the organ&#x27;s tonal specification during the update to Trillium level Parallel Digital Imaging technology.

The current Rodgers touring organ is Hector Olivera&#x27;s &quot;The King&quot;, a black four manual organ featuring a custom French specification that Olivera plays in various concert venues nationally.

==Television==
In 2006, a Rodgers Allegiant 657 was installed in the family chapel of the White Family on ABC Television&#x27;s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.

Previously, &quot;John Ratzenberger&#x27;s Made in America&quot; Travel Channel show featured at segment on Rodgers filmed at Rodgers’ Hillsboro, Oregon plant. That episode still appears from time to time on the Travel Channel.

Rodgers factory is also featured in Karen Axelrod and Bruce Brumberg’s popular “Watch it Made in the U.S.A.” books profiling interesting factory tours of American manufacturing facilities.

A four-manual Rodgers organ, formerly the residence organ of Dr. Frederick Swann, is heard and seen weekly on the Hour of Power broadcast.

==Availability==

The availability of Rodgers Instruments is ensured by the distribution and the sales of an international dealer network. The factory to produce these organs in the United States was sold by previous owners of Rodgers ie Roland . Currently consoles are constructed in Holland and organs are assembled in the United States to avoid excessive duties and tariffs. These include Rodgers Organs in Canada, ChurchOrganWorld in the UK and Rodgers Organs in Germany.

<doc id="629350" wikidata="Q1747227" url="?curid=629350" title="Grand Theft Auto (film)">
<text>Grand Theft Auto is a 1977 American road action comedy film starring and directed by Ron Howard, in his feature film directorial debut. Howard also wrote the screenplay with his real-life father Rance Howard, who also co-starred in the film. As of 2023, this is the only film that Howard has both directed and starred in. The film takes its title from the crime grand theft auto, which is committed a number of times by several different characters.

In the film, a wealthy political candidate pressures his daughter to marry a similarly wealthy suitor instead of her current love interest. The daughter steals her parents&#x27; car and flees towards Las Vegas with her love interest. Her unwanted suitor steals another car and chases her. He also offers a reward to whoever can catch the woman for him. The suitor is himself chased by his worried mother.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, wealthy couple Bigby and Priscilla Powers, want their daughter Paula to marry Collins Hedgeworth, who also hails from a wealthy family. Paula is really in love with classmate Sam Freeman, whom Bigby dismisses as a &quot;fortune hunter.&quot; Bigby is running for governor and wants her to cooperate. However, Paula refuses to marry Collins and plans to elope with Sam to Las Vegas. Bigby threatens to disinherit her and take away her sports car (that she bought with her own money) if she disobeys him.

Paula later flees, stealing her parents&#x27; car and hitting the road with Sam to Las Vegas. Bigby calls his associate Ned Slinker, asking him to bring back Paula and the car, and to have Sam incarcerated, without involvement of police and news media. Priscilla gets a call from Collins and tells him Paula ran off. Enraged, Collins takes off in his car. After crashing it, he steals another car from a nearby dealership to continue the chase. His mother Vivian learns of this and decides to go after him before the police could arrest him.

Collins catches up with Paula and Sam on the Interstate, but ends up crashing the stolen car. Before stealing another car, he calls the TenQ radio station to DJ Curly Q. Brown, offering $25,000 to whoever can catch her. Several people, including mechanics Ace and Sparky, set off after Paula and Sam. Vivian also calls TenQ, offering $25,000 for Collins&#x27;s safe return. While running a red light, she attracts the attention of Officer Norman Tad, who chases after her. After she crashes into a tree, Tad attempts to arrest her. Her blurting out trying to save Collins is overheard by a nearby preacher, who steals the police car to collect the reward money. Vivian continues the chase, prompting Tad to commandeer a bus.

After hearing a radio listener call-in saying that Sam ought to be shot, Paula calls the station from the car phone and tells her side of the story. Upon hearing it, Curly announces that he will root for them. He goes up in a helicopter to follow Paula and Sam, sharing their location and attracting more people to collect the reward as a result. When Collins crashes his stolen car, the preacher attempts to catch him and collect his money, but Collins convinces him to chase after Paula with him to double the reward. Tad arrests Vivian and drags her onto the bus with him, as they continue the chase after Paula and Sam.

As Paula and Sam cross the Nevada state line, Slinker hires a Vegas mob to try to stop them. The pursuing cars all end up in a demolition derby. The couple&#x27;s car is destroyed, with Paula and Sam bailing out before, causing a massive pile-up. The crowd cheers them on. In a van, Bigby and Slinker chase after Paula and Sam, but derby cars crash into them. Paula and Sam reach the grandstand, and the crowd lets them through. As Bigby, Slinker, Collins and the preacher reach the bleachers, the crowd boos them and pelts them with food, allowing Paula and Sam to flee in a taxi, as the police arrives and arrests the pursuers. When Vivian reaches her son, she tells him not to fret about Paula, calling her &quot;socially inferior.&quot; Noticing the way they talk about Paula, Bigby starts a fight, attempting to defend her honor. This event makes him concede that perhaps Paula did marry the right man.

At the chapel, Paula and Sam are married, and the minister asks for their autographs. While exiting the chapel, they are surrounded by fans, including a hotel owner offering them a free stay in a honeymoon suite, alongside a ride there in a limousine. As they go to the hotel, Curly pursues them in a station wagon to get them to do an interview, but misses an oncoming firetruck and ends up crashing through a house into a swimming pool. Paula and Sam, meanwhile, kiss.

==Cast==
==Production==
When executive producer Roger Corman was testing titles for &quot;Eat My Dust!,&quot; &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; came a close second as a possible title. So when making a follow-up he decided to call it &quot;Grand Theft Auto.&quot;

The film was made on a budget of $602,000. It was filmed in and around Victorville, California. Roger Corman worked as an executive producer, along with Rance Howard, who also co-wrote the script with Ron Howard. When Howard pleaded Corman for an extra half day to reshoot a scene, Corman responded &quot;Ron, you can come back if you want, but nobody else will be there.&quot;

==Reception==
The film was a commercial success, earning over $15 million at the box office, but critical reception was negative. It holds a rating of 29% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews.

==Home media==
The film was released on Region One DVD in 1999 and re-released in 2006 and 2008.

==Planned remake==
The screenplay for a remake of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, written by Jason Dean Hall, appeared in the 2008 Black List, and was subsequently set to be produced by Corman, Stuart Parr, and Paul Rosenberg for Fox Atomic (although it never came to fruition); due to the script&#x27;s deviations from the original film, it was initially assumed to be an adaptation for the similarly titled &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; video games.

<text>To the 5 Boroughs is the sixth studio album by the American hip-hop group Beastie Boys. The album was released on June 14, 2004 internationally, and a day later in the United States. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the group&#x27;s third consecutive album to do so, with 360,000 copies sold in its first week and is certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 1,000,000 in the U.S. It was the group&#x27;s first major release after the September 11 attacks on New York City and reflects on the after-effects.

==Release and promotion==
The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Ch-Check It Out&quot; debuted on &quot;The O.C.&quot; in &quot;The Strip&quot; from Season 1, airing on April 28, 2004. The album was the cause of some controversy with allegations that it installed spyware when inserted into the CD-ROM of a computer. The band has denied this allegation saying there is no copy protection software on the albums sold in the U.S. and in the U.K. While there is Macrovision CDS-200 copy protection software installed on European copies of the album this is standard practice for all European releases on EMI/Capitol Records released in Europe and it does not install spyware or any form of permanent software.

==Singles==
The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Ch-Check It Out&quot; was released on April 28, 2004. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Triple Trouble&quot; was released in July 2004. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Right Right Now Now&quot; was released in 2004. The album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;An Open Letter to NYC&quot; was released in November 2004.

==Critical reception==

The album was met with positive reviews, with an aggregated score of 71 on Metacritic. &quot;Playlouder&quot; said &quot;&quot;To the 5 Boroughs&quot; is a triumph.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;&quot;To the 5 Boroughs&quot; is an exciting, astonishing balancing act: fast, funny and sobering.&quot; Jason Thompson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called &quot;To the 5 Boroughs&quot; &quot;their best album since &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;&quot;. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The beats are[...] simple and effective, with a welcome lack of bells and whistles that made &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; so distracting.&quot; AllMusic said: &quot;It&#x27;s rather impressive that they&#x27;re maturing gracefully turning into expert craftsmen who can deliver a satisfying listen like this&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; said: &quot;Like Missy Elliott, the Beasties are re-examining hip hop—what it was, what it is, what it can be&quot;. &quot;The Onion AV Club&quot; said: &quot;With &quot;To the 5 Boroughs&quot;, Beastie Boys&#x27; members discover a musical entryway to an earlier, more innocent era, affording listeners the exuberance of youth along with the hard-won wisdom that can only come with experience.&quot; &quot;E! Online&quot; rated the album as a B− saying it was &quot;fun but hardly fresh.

<doc id="629356" wikidata="Q3017229" url="?curid=629356" title="Dave Righetti">
<text>David Allan Righetti (born November 28, 1958), nicknamed &quot;Rags&quot;, is an American professional baseball coach and former player. A left-handed pitcher, Righetti played in Major League Baseball from 1979 through 1995 for the New York Yankees, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, and Chicago White Sox. He served as the pitching coach for the Giants from 2000 through 2017.

Righetti began his career as a starting pitcher, but the Yankees converted him into a relief pitcher, using him as their closer, in 1984. He won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award in 1981. As a starter, he threw a no-hitter on July 4, 1983. As a closer, he was twice named the AL Rolaids Relief Man of the Year and pitched in two MLB All-Star Games. He was the first player in history to both pitch a no-hitter and also lead the league in saves in his career. Dennis Eckersley later duplicated the feat, as did Derek Lowe.

==Early life==
David Allan Righetti was born on November 28, 1958, in San Jose, California. His father, Leo, was a professional baseball player. His brother, Steve, is thirteen months older than Dave. Leo trained his sons to become baseball players. Dave and Steve starred for their Lincoln Glen Little League team, Letterman, with Dave playing in the outfield and Steve playing shortstop.

Righetti attended Pioneer High School. Paddy Cottrell, a scout for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball, noticed Righetti and suggested he become a pitcher due to his throwing motion. As a senior, he was named to the All-League team.

==College career==
Righetti enrolled at San Jose City College, where he continued his development as a pitcher on the school&#x27;s baseball team. He was named the junior college player of the year, beating out teammate Dave Stieb.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
At Cottrell&#x27;s urging, the Rangers selected Righetti on January 11, 1977, in the first round (10th overall pick) of the amateur draft. The Rangers selected Steve in the sixth round, and told Dave that they would only sign Steve if he signed. Both Righetti brothers signed with the Rangers. Dave made his professional debut that year in minor league baseball with the Asheville Tourists of the Class A Western Carolinas League, where he pitched to an 11–3 win–loss record.

In 1978, Righetti pitched for the Tulsa Drillers of the Class AA Texas League. In a July game against the Midland RockHounds, Righetti recorded a league-record 21 strikeouts. Jerry Walker, a scout for the New York Yankees, was present in the stands. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, while negotiating a trade with Rangers owner Brad Corbett that offseason, specifically waited until late in their negotiations to ask that Righetti be added to the trade. On November 10, 1978, the Yankees acquired Righetti, along with Juan Beníquez, Mike Griffin, Greg Jemison, and Paul Mirabella, while the Rangers acquired Sparky Lyle, Domingo Ramos, Mike Heath, Larry McCall, Dave Rajsich, and cash. The Yankees introduced Righetti as &quot;the next Ron Guidry&quot;. Righetti was almost traded to the Minnesota Twins in January 1979; the Twins and Yankees were unable to complete a deal in which Righetti, Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, and Dámaso García would have moved to Minnesota in exchange for Rod Carew.

===New York Yankees (1979–1990)===
Righetti made his major league debut with the Yankees on September 16, 1979, wearing uniform number 56. In this game against the Detroit Tigers he pitched five innings, striking out three and allowing three hits, six walks, and three earned runs. After Righetti made his second start, Yankees&#x27; manager Billy Martin declared that Righetti &quot;will win 20 games next season&quot;. However, Righetti struggled with his control, and spent the 1980 season with the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League, where he had a 6–10 win–loss record and a 4.63 ERA with 101 walks and 139 strikeouts in 142 innings.
Though Righetti pitched well in spring training in 1981, the Yankees did not have room for him on their roster, so he began the season with Columbus. After he pitched to a 5–0 record and 1.00 ERA with 50 strikeouts in 45 innings, the Yankees recalled Righetti from Columbus in May 1981. He was assigned uniform number 19. The Yankees reserved numbers ending in 9 for pitchers they viewed as having promise: Dick Tidrow wore 19 for the Yankees, while Catfish Hunter wore 29, Ron Davis wore 39, and Guidry wore 49. Righetti pitched strongly as a starter for the Yankees, posting an 8–4 win–loss record in 15 games started, with a 2.06 earned run average (ERA) and 89 strikeouts in 105 innings pitched during the 1981 season. Righetti won the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award, beating Rich Gedman and Bob Ojeda. Righetti defeated the Milwaukee Brewers twice during the 1981 American League Division Series. The Yankees reached the World Series that year; however, he was knocked out of game three of the 1981 World Series early, which was won by the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In 1982, Righetti pitched to an 8.53 ERA during spring training. Steinbrenner sought to demote Righetti to the minor leagues, but stated he &quot;got outvoted then&quot;.
Through June 1982, Righetti had pitched to a 5–5 win–loss record with a 4.23 ERA. Though his 77 strikeouts were fourth-best in the American League, his 62 walks were considered a problem. The Yankees demoted Righetti to the minor leagues, for what Steinbrenner termed a &quot;-week intensive brushing up&quot;. Sammy Ellis, Righetti&#x27;s pitching coach with Columbus, said that Righetti had been rushing his pitching motion, which was likely due to anxiety. Working with Ellis, Righetti made four starts for the Clippers, recording 33 strikeouts in 26 innings, before he was recalled to New York. Righetti finished the 1982 season with 11 wins in 27 starts, with a 3.79 ERA and 162 strikeouts and 108 walks. His strikeouts were third-best in the AL, while his walks led the league.

On July 4, 1983, Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. It was the first Yankee no-hitter since Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series, and the first by a Yankee left-hander since 1917. Righetti recorded a swinging strikeout against Wade Boggs to end the game. Twenty-five years later, Righetti reminisced about the game:

My biggest worry, because I had a tendency to fall toward third base, was him (Boggs) tapping a ball between me and Mattingly and me trying to get to first base...I threw a lot of fastballs during the at bat, but the last slider I ended up throwing, he happened to miss it. Thank goodness. 

In 1984 Righetti was moved to the Yankees&#x27; bullpen to replace Goose Gossage, who signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason, as their closer. Despite the move being due to the Yankees having an excess of starters, many criticized the decision, arguing that Righetti was more valuable pitching as a starter, where he would accrue more innings.

Entering his first game as a relief pitcher with the bases loaded, Righetti did not allow an inherited runner to score, retiring the final seven batters of the game. He proved even more effective in relief, averaging 32 saves per season over the next seven years with the Yankees, and being named an All-Star in 1986 and 1987. On October 4, 1986, he saved both games of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, finishing the season with 46 saves, and breaking the major league record shared by Dan Quisenberry and Bruce Sutter. The record would stand until Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White Sox in 1990. Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers until 1993, when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti still owns the AL record for left-handers.

Righetti became a free agent after the 1987 season. Amid rumors that Righetti would sign a three-year contract worth $20 million with the Tokyo Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball, Righetti&#x27;s agent acknowledged that the Giants did make Righetti an offer, but stated that the value was considerably less than what was reported, and stated that Righetti would continue to pitch in MLB. The contract offer was later estimated at $10 million. Righetti chose to re-sign with the Yankees, signing a three-year contract worth $4.5 million.

Righetti struggled with the Yankees early in the 1988 season, blowing four consecutive save opportunities, resulting in boos from the Yankee Stadium crowds. He then recorded five saves in consecutive opportunities.

Righetti became concerned with the direction the Yankees were taking, as they had traded away Rickey Henderson, Jack Clark, and Dave Winfield.

===San Francisco Giants (1991–1993)===
After the 1990 season, Righetti signed as a free agent with the San Francisco Giants, receiving a four-year contract worth $10 million. While with the Giants in 1991, he broke Lyle&#x27;s major league record for left-handers of 238 career saves; Righetti&#x27;s record stood until 1994, when John Franco surpassed his eventual total of 252.

Righetti saved 24 games in 1991. He lost the closer role during the 1992 season to Rod Beck. Righetti made a start on June 10, 1992, his first start since September 1983. He pitched in middle relief for the Giants in the 1993 season.

===Oakland Athletics (1994)===
Released by the Giants after the 1993 season, Righetti signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. After beginning 1994 with the Athletics, he was released.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1994)===
Righetti signed as a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays in May 1994. Righetti had a 0–1 win–loss record and 6.75 ERA for the Blue Jays.

After that season, Righetti was released by the Blue Jays.

===Chicago White Sox (1995)===
In 1995, Righetti signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox. On November 9, 1995, he was again granted free agency; but no team signed him. Righetti retired to end his 16-year career, finishing with 252 saves, a 3.46 ERA, and a record of 82–79 in 718 games.

==Coaching career==
===San Francisco Giants (2000–2017)===
In 2000, Righetti became the pitching coach for the Giants. Righetti&#x27;s pitchers helped the Giants win the 2002 National League pennant, although the Giants would lose the World Series in seven games to the Anaheim Angels.
Despite uncertainty if he would return to the Giants for the 2007 season due to a managerial change, Righetti announced in early November 2007 that he would remain with the Giants in his present role. He was the pitching coach for the pitching staff that included Matt Cain, Madison Bumgarner, Tim Lincecum, Jonathan Sánchez, and Brian Wilson that won the 2010, 2012, and 2014 World Series. An analysis by Fangraphs showed that Righetti has an uncanny knack for teaching pitchers to avoid giving up home runs.

After the 2017 team tied for a Major League-worst 64–98 win–loss record, Righetti was removed from his role as pitching coach on October 21, 2017, and moved into a front-office role with the Giants. Righetti spent his entire 18 season coaching career as pitching coach of the San Francisco Giants, working under managers Dusty Baker, Felipe Alou, and Bruce Bochy. He served as the bullpen coach for the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.

==Personal life==
Righetti and his wife had triplets (two daughters and one son), who were born in 1991; Righetti&#x27;s sister-in-law served as a surrogate mother.

<text>HMS &quot;Gravelines&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Gravelines, which took place in 1588, resulting in the English Navy defeating the Spanish Armada. &quot;Gravelines&quot; was built by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead. She was laid down on 10 August 1943, launched on 30 November 1944 and completed on 14 June 1946.

==Service==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Gravelines&quot; was placed in reserve along with a number of her other sister-ships. In 1949, &quot;Gravelines&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, which joined the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Gravelines&quot; exchanged crews with the destroyer on 10 March 1953 and returned to the UK where she was paid off into the reserve fleet.

In 1955, &quot;Gravelines&quot;, with the rest of the 3rd Flotilla, returned once again to the Mediterranean, and was in the area during the Suez Crisis, which had occurred in response to the Egyptian President Nasser&#x27;s nationalisation of the Suez Canal. That same year, &quot;Gravelines&quot; returned to a colder climate, when she, along with the rest of the Flotilla, joined the Home Fleet, based in the UK. In 1957, &quot;Gravelines&quot; began a refit, though it was cancelled the following year. &quot;Gravelines&quot; arrived for scrapping at Rosyth on 4 April 1961.

<doc id="629386" wikidata="Q958194" url="?curid=629386" title="Navicular bone">
<text>The navicular bone is a small bone found in the feet of most mammals.

== Human anatomy ==
The navicular bone in humans is one of the tarsal bones, found in the foot. Its name derives from the human bone&#x27;s resemblance to a small boat, caused by the strongly concave proximal articular surface. The term &quot;navicular bone&quot; or &quot;hand navicular bone&quot; was formerly used for the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones of the wrist.

The navicular bone in humans is located on the medial side of the foot, and articulates proximally with the talus, distally with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally with the cuboid.

It is the last of the foot bones to start ossification and does not tend to do so until the end of the third year in girls and the beginning of the fourth year in boys, although a large range of variation has been reported.

The tibialis posterior is the only muscle that attaches to the navicular bone. The main portion of the muscle inserts into the tuberosity of the navicular bone. An accessory navicular bone may be present in 2–14% of the general population.

===Clinical significance===
The human navicular is not a commonly broken bone but it breaks due to two reasons. The first mechanism is a stress fracture which happens commonly in athletes, and the other mechanism is a high energy trauma. 

New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath broke the navicular bone in his right wrist during a 1970 game vs. the Baltimore Colts, sidelining him for the final nine games of the season. 

The navicular bone is a keystone of the foot: it is part of the coxa pedis and articulates with the talus, first, second and third cuneiform, cuboid and calcaneus. It plays an important role in the biomechanics of the foot, helping in inversion, eversion, and motion; it is a structural link between midfoot and forefoot and it is part of the longitudinal and transverse arch of the foot.

== Horse anatomy ==

The horse has a sesamoid bone called the navicular bone, located within the hoof, that lies on the palmar aspect of the coffin joint between the second phalanx and third phalanx (coffin bone). The navicular bone in the horse is supported by the distal sesamoidean impar ligament and two collateral sesamoidean ligaments. The navicular bursa is located between the flexor surface of the navicular bone and the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs between the bursa and the distal phalanx. The central tarsal bone in the hock of the horse is homologous and analogous to the navicular bone of the human foot, and thus the navicular bone in the horse is a different structure from the eponymously labeled bone in humans.
The navicular region is an important structure in relation to lameness, particularly in the front feet, and is involved with a significant disease process called navicular disease or navicular syndrome. Recently much of the original literature concerning navicular disease has been called into question, particularly the significance of radiographic changes as a sole diagnostic criterion. Navicular syndrome may be responsible for as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis. Newer imaging techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.

<text>The Boao Forum for Asia (BFA; ), initiated by 25 Asian countries and Australia (increased to 28 in 2006), is a nonprofit that hosts high-level forums for leaders from government, business and academia in Asia and other continents to share their vision on the most pressing issues in this region and the world at large. Though its fixed address is in Bo&#x27;ao, Hainan province, China, its Secretariat is based in Beijing. The forum, sometimes known as the “Asian Davos”, takes its name from the town of Boao, located in China&#x27;s southern Hainan province, which has been the permanent venue for its annual conference since 2002.

The Forum is committed to promoting regional economic integration and bringing Asian countries even closer to their development goals. Initiated in 1998 by Fidel V. Ramos, former President of the Philippines, Bob Hawke, former Prime Minister of Australia, and Morihiro Hosokawa, former Prime Minister of Japan, the Boao Forum for Asia was formally inaugurated in February 2001. The founding of the BFA was driven by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and founded by 26 Asian and Australasian states on 27 February 2001. The organisation held its first meeting from 12 to 13 April 2002.

Discussions at the BFA focus on economics, integration, cooperation, society and the environment. In the past the forum also addressed China&#x27;s entry into the World Trade Organization, as well as Southeast Asia&#x27;s economic crisis during the 1990s. The geopolitical strategy &#x27;China&#x27;s peaceful rise&#x27; was a topic of discussion for the forum in 2004. In addition to its annual meeting, the BFA also sponsors other forums and meetings related to Asian issues.

The conferences brought together business, industry and political leaders in the region to discuss energy and resource security, development and trade. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd stated China will invest US 1 trillion dollars abroad and Australia is in a good position to attract capital to develop new mines, infrastructure to service China&#x27;s insatiable appetite for energy and resources. Rudd also indicated while Chinese capital is essential for Australia&#x27;s economic future, China needs to do more in relaxing foreign investment rules for Australian companies such as restrictions on types of businesses, equity restrictions and branch or representative office caps.

== 2021 ==
In 2020, China joined the G20-led Debt Service Suspension Initiative, through which official bilateral creditors suspended debt repayments of 73 of the poorest debtor countries. At the 2021 Boao Forum, Export-Import Bank of China president Hu Xiaolin stated that the interest of both debtors and creditors should be considered in debt suspension. Hu stated, &quot;Debt suspension is neither debt reduction nor debt cancellation. It is an adjustment made to tackle difficulties at specific times&quot; and that outright cancellation weakens financial stability.

== 2022 ==
At the 2022 Forum, Xi announced China&#x27;s Global Security Initiative. The Global Security Initiative identifies six commitments: (1) common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security; (2) respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; (3) abiding by the purpose and principles of the UN Charter; (4) peacefully resolving disputes between countries through dialogue; (5) taking the security concerns of all countries seriously; and (6) maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional fields. The principles outlined by the Global Security Initiative are long-standing elements of China&#x27;s security policy and little operational detail was provided.

<doc id="629418" wikidata="Q6920212" url="?curid=629418" title="Mount Columbia (Colorado)">
<text>Mount Columbia is a high mountain summit of the Collegiate Peaks in the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains of North America. The fourteener is located in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness of San Isabel National Forest, northwest by west (bearing 301°) of the Town of Buena Vista in Chaffee County, Colorado, United States. The mountain was named by Roger W. Toll in honor of his alma mater, Columbia University, and in commemoration of its rowing victory at the renowned Henley Royal Regatta in 1878.

==Mountain==
Along with nearby Mount Harvard, Mount Yale, Mount Princeton, and Mount Oxford, Mount Columbia is one of five Collegiate Peaks named for prominent universities. Due to a notoriously challenging scree field located on the standard route, Mount Columbia is usually only climbed by those wishing to climb all of Colorado&#x27;s fourteeners. The forest service recommends that hikers take the user-created Horn Fork Basin Route, an 11-mile roundtrip that gains 5,800 feet in elevation. The area near the scree field is severely eroded, and although there are efforts to build a new trail to replace the current user-created trail, the formal trail has not yet been completed.

<doc id="629421" wikidata="Q5582974" url="?curid=629421" title="Good Stuff">
<text>Good Stuff is the sixth studio album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released in 1992 by Reprise Records. It was conceived after the band&#x27;s manager urged them to quickly issue a follow-up to their highly successful album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; (1989); it was created without founding member Cindy Wilson, who was on a temporary hiatus. The album peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and its title track peaked at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Good Stuff&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Background==
&quot;Good Stuff&quot; was created in the wake of the departure of B-52&#x27;s singer and founding member Cindy Wilson, who left the band after an Earth Day performance in Central Park in 1990. The band were just finishing up 18 months of touring, following the massive success of their 1989 album, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;. Wilson would ultimately be absent from the band from 1990 to 1994, taking a hiatus to raise children, and later stated, &quot;My clock was ticking, so I chose to take some time off.&quot; Wilson said that another reason for her departure was that she still missed her brother Ricky Wilson, the band&#x27;s former guitarist who died in 1985; she also &quot;needed to step back and chill.&quot; Fred Schneider recalled, &quot;All of a sudden she just decided she was quitting ... so it was real stressful. It was a real shock.&quot; However, the band continued with Wilson&#x27;s blessing and eventually hired Julee Cruise to tour as a vocalist with the band.

Guitarist Keith Strickland later stated that &quot;Good Stuff&quot; came about when the band&#x27;s management pushed them to record a quick follow-up to capitalize on the success of &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, despite them being &quot;burnt out&quot; and &quot;exhausted&quot; from touring. Like &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, &quot;Good Stuff&quot; was produced jointly by Nile Rodgers and Don Was.

==Commercial performance==
The title track, &quot;Good Stuff&quot;, was issued as the lead single and peaked at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, charting for 13 weeks. The album charted for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and went on to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Tom Waits&#x27;s &quot;Bone Machine&quot;.

==Critical reception==
David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt the album &quot;reduces their sound to a dull formula&quot;, and that &quot;their attempts to keep the party going... sound more forced than ever&quot;, although he cited &quot;Revolution Earth&quot; as the highlight. Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the work of the two producers &quot;impressively seamless&quot;, citing &quot;Dreamland&quot; and &quot;Bad Influence&quot; as highlights, and added that &quot;[Kate] Pierson&#x27;s richly textured vocals hold up just fine on their own&quot; in light of the absence of Cindy Wilson.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought the title track &quot;was a transparent attempt to recapture the good vibes of &#x27;Love Shack&#x27;&quot; that &quot;didn&#x27;t succeed&quot; but &quot;did have the distinction of being the best single pulled from &quot;Good Stuff&quot;.&quot;

<text>The 1994 European Parliament election was the fourth European election to be held in the United Kingdom. It was held on Thursday 9 June, though, as usual, the ballots were not counted until the evening of Sunday 12 June. The electoral system was, for the final European election, first past the post in England, Scotland and Wales and single transferable vote in Northern Ireland. This was the first election with 87 MEPs, the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1993 having increased the number of seats for the UK from 81. For the first time, the UK did not have the lowest turnout in Europe. Turnout was lower in the Netherlands and Portugal.

This was the first European election contested by the recently formed UK Independence Party (UKIP), and the first European election in which the Liberal Democrats won seats. The Green Party lost more than three-quarters of the votes they secured in the previous election. The Conservatives lost 14 seats, taking their number of seats down to 18, which was 42 fewer seats than in the 1979 election, the year they defeated the Labour Party in the 1979 General Election. This reflected the general unpopularity of the Major government at the time.

Five by-elections to the British Parliament also took place on the same day in the Barking, Bradford South, Dagenham, Eastleigh, and Newham North East constituencies. The Conservatives lost Eastleigh to the Liberal Democrats; Labour would hold the other four.

Labour was under the interim leadership of Margaret Beckett following the sudden death of leader John Smith the previous month.

<text>Cosmic Thing is the fifth studio album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released in 1989 by Reprise Records. It contains the hit singles &quot;Love Shack&quot;, &quot;Roam&quot; and &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot;. The music video for &quot;Love Shack&quot; won the award for Best Group Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. Six of the album&#x27;s songs were produced by Nile Rodgers in New York City, and the remaining four by Don Was in upstate New York.

&quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; was the ninth best-selling album of 1990 in the US, peaking at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was an international success as well, charting in the Top 10 in the UK, and reaching No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand. The album eventually achieved 4× Platinum status in the US and Platinum status in the UK. Its success served as a comeback for the band, following the death of guitarist, songwriter and founding member Ricky Wilson in 1985. The band also embarked on the worldwide Cosmic Tour to promote the album.

==Background==
Following guitarist Ricky Wilson&#x27;s death and the band&#x27;s short promotional campaign for their 1986 album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, the band was uncertain about their future together. The album had been the band&#x27;s most expensive to produce, and their foregoing of a tour to promote it resulted in the band seeing little revenue, which led to them experiencing great financial difficulties.

In 1988, prompted by drummer/guitarist Keith Strickland, the band began to group together and write new songs. Singer Kate Pierson described this as a healing process for herself and the band after Wilson&#x27;s death three years prior. Much of the album was written in Woodstock and surrounding areas in upstate New York, a place to which Strickland and Pierson had both relocated during the group&#x27;s hiatus, and all four members felt a proximity to nature in these places that was not found in their previous home of New York City. The band spent approximately a year writing the songs. Strickland stated, &quot;We spent a lot of time just talking, and we needed that. We were our own support group after Ricky&#x27;s passing, which was a very traumatic thing for all of us and, in particular, for Cindy.&quot;

The band rented a rehearsal space in the Wall Street area of Manhattan, in which they worked four days a week. At this time, the band also left their longtime manager, Gary Kurfirst, and left longtime label Warner Bros. for Reprise.

==Composition==
In the wake of Wilson&#x27;s death, Strickland took over both guitar duties and the bulk of the music composition responsibilities. For the new songs, Strickland recorded instrumental demos and singers Pierson, Cindy Wilson and Fred Schneider would then improvise melodies and lyrics over the recordings, with all four band members devising the final song arrangements together. The first piece of music Strickland composed for the album would eventually become &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot;, whose autobiographical lyrics about the band&#x27;s early life in Athens, Georgia would serve as a blueprint for the album. &quot;Junebug&quot; was the first song to be fully completed during the band&#x27;s compositional jam sessions, which gave them confidence to persevere. Pierson described these songs as being &quot;cinematic&quot; and &quot;nostalgic&quot;, and felt that the album in general had developed a &quot;rural, kind of southern, dusty feeling to it&quot;. Wilson added, &quot;It was all about nostalgia. It was looking back at the good times we used to have in Athens, so it was a wonderful, healing record.&quot;

Pierson stated that some songs on &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; were more &quot;pointed&quot; about their concerns—such as environmentalism—than on previous albums, adding, &quot;we definitely still have a light tone, but I think we&#x27;ve all evolved and grown and matured&quot;. Discussing &quot;Channel Z&quot;, Schneider later recalled, &quot;We were really pretty political as a band. Rather than clothes and wigs and stuff, I&#x27;d rather talk about politics, and I know the others do too, because it&#x27;s more important, what&#x27;s going on in the world.&quot;

==Recording and production==
Recording of the album was focused in two locations: Skyline Studios in New York City, and Dreamland Recording Studios in West Hurley, New York. The initial sessions in New York City were produced by Nile Rodgers, while the West Hurley sessions were helmed by Don Was. The band had previously worked with Rodgers when he recorded their song &quot;(Shake That) Cosmic Thing&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1988 film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;.

The album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Love Shack&quot;, was the last song recorded for the album and was developed from a 15-minute unfinished piece the band had created. Strickland had initially felt the song was not ready to be released, but Pierson and Schneider felt it would be successful. After the band finished their sessions with Was a day ahead of schedule, he asked if they had any more material and the song was brought in to refine and embellish upon.

Music journalist Michael Azerrad noted that Strickland devised the album&#x27;s final track sequence as if it were a film, moving from rural themes to more abstract concepts, culminating with an instrumental coda akin to a closing credits sequence. Strickland later elaborated: &quot;We sequenced it in a way that we felt told a story. I don&#x27;t know if anybody&#x27;s ever noticed it, but one song leads into the other in a nice way. It tells a story from beginning to end.&quot;

==Promotion and commercial performance==
&quot;Channel Z&quot; was selected as the album&#x27;s first single and was released in March 1989. While the single was not commercially successful in the mainstream at first, it generated substantial amounts of airplay on American college radio, helping re-establish the group&#x27;s youth popularity. The single eventually peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, and reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.

Following the release of promotional single &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, June 1989 saw the release of the band&#x27;s largest global hit, &quot;Love Shack&quot;. Pierson recalled that radio programmers initially &quot;weren&#x27;t really enthusiastic&quot; about the song and that Schneider was instrumental in promoting it to indie radio stations, which eventually led to its embrace by college radio. The track helped propel the success of the album globally, while reaching number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also reached number 2 in the UK, and spent 8 weeks at number one in Australia in 1990. Following this, the album reached the top 10 in the US and UK album charts, and number one in Australia and New Zealand. The song&#x27;s music video won the award for Best Group Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards.

Aided by the further success of singles such as the transatlantic top 20 hit &quot;Roam&quot; and the US top 30 hit &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot;, the album continued to sell strongly, particularly in the US, where it spent 22 weeks inside the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top 10 in 1990, becoming the country&#x27;s 9th best-selling album of the year.

By 2000, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; had achieved platinum status in the UK, and 4× platinum status in the US, denoting sales of over four million copies there. As of 2019, the album had sold over five million copies worldwide.

==Critical reception==
Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; opined that the album was &quot;an almost touchingly brave attempt to dance away from the edge of ecocatastrophe&quot; and found the band &quot;trying to be seriously silly&quot;, but concluded that, &quot;between Ricky Wilson&#x27;s guitar and the permanent defeat his loss doesn&#x27;t merely signify, they can&#x27;t quite bring it off.&quot; Jim Farber of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; thought the album found the B-52&#x27;s &quot;on summer vacation, hanging out in the heat, fashioning insouciant odes to sloth&quot;, and that the band still mixed seriousness with &quot;an impassioned commitment to goofiness.&quot; He continued that the best songs &quot;proudly declare silliness as a central part of identity&quot; and that their most exciting material had always been &quot;ballads with a backbeat&quot;, citing &quot;Roam&quot; and &quot;Dry County&quot; as examples. Kristine McKenna of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt the album sounded &quot;remarkably fresh&quot;, despite adhering to a classic formula, and observed that &quot;the slower pace of life associated with the South colors the entire album&quot;, noting that Wilson and Pierson &quot;give soul to this irresistible LP, which may shape up to be the record you hear at every party this summer.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album to be &quot;a first-class return to form&quot; that &quot;updated their sound with shiny new surfaces and deep, funky grooves&quot;, containing &quot;their best set of songs since at least &quot;Wild Planet&quot;, possibly since their debut.&quot; J.D. Considine in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; observed that the songs &quot;reprise the band&#x27;s early sound without any edge or ambiguity&quot;, and saw the band &quot;tumble into self-caricature.&quot; Rich Wilhelm of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that while &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; &quot;fully brought the band&#x27;s sound to the mainstream&quot;, it also &quot;proved to have depth&quot; and was &quot;a fun, beautiful, and life-affirming record that was also a big hit.&quot;

==Tour==
In addition to the album&#x27;s successful singles, the band embarked upon the extensive &quot;Cosmic Tour&quot; to promote the album worldwide, their first tour since Ricky Wilson&#x27;s death. Drummer Strickland switched to guitar for the tour with Zack Alford serving as the touring drummer. Sara Lee played bass guitar and Pat Irwin was keyboardist and extra guitarist. This was also the first tour in which the group hired a backing band, meaning the group&#x27;s members, especially Pierson, had more opportunity to move around on stage and gave their songs more accuracy to the studio versions in concert. Due to the band&#x27;s growth in popularity at this time, the tour venues grew from theaters to large arenas and stadiums.

The band&#x27;s first comeback performance was at a benefit for PETA and they arranged for various organizations, including PETA, Greenpeace and Amnesty International, to advertise at each concert&#x27;s venue.

<text>Adeva (born Patricia Daniels) is an American singer. She had a string of successful house and R&amp;B hits in the late 1980s to early 1990s, including &quot;Warning!&quot;, &quot;I Thank You&quot; and &quot;Respect&quot; (all three of which reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart).

== Early life ==
Born in 1960 in Paterson, New Jersey, Daniels was the youngest of six children. She developed her voice as a member, and later director and vocal coach, of her church choir. She began singing professionally in the mid-1980s, releasing the single &quot;In and Out of My Life&quot; in 1988 on Easy Street Records.

== Debut album ==
Immediately after this, she signed with the UK label Cooltempo (a subsidiary of EMI) later in 1988 and released a house reworking of the Aretha Franklin hit &quot;Respect&quot; that reached #17 in the UK. Her debut album &quot;Adeva!&quot; was released in August 1989, and peaked at #6 on the UK Albums Chart, #28 in Germany, and #14 in Australia. The album was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for UK sales exceeding 300,000 copies. In addition to &quot;Respect&quot;, the album contained several other hit singles including &quot;Warning!&quot; and &quot;I Thank You&quot;, both of which also reached #17 in the UK, and &quot;Musical Freedom&quot; which reached #22. The album was released in the United States in 1990 via EMI&#x27;s Capitol Records, where &quot;Warning!&quot; had become a top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart hit.

== Later career ==
Her second album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Love or Lust&quot; failed to chart in both the UK and US, despite featuring two hit singles on the US Dance chart, &quot;Independent Woman&quot; (US Dance #7) and &quot;It Should Have Been Me&quot; (US Dance #1), and she was dropped by Cooltempo in 1992.

Adeva collaborated with house-music pioneer Frankie Knuckles in 1995, with whom she released two UK top 40 singles and an album, &quot;Welcome to the Real World&quot;.

In 1997, Adeva released another album, &quot;New Direction&quot;, on Distinctive Records, but it was unsuccessful. It was her last album to date, although she was featured on various singles in 2003–04 with other artists, including Radical Noiz and Eric Prydz, who both sampled Adeva&#x27;s 1988 single &quot;In and out of My Life&quot;, which was also sampled by OnePhatDeeva in 1999. She was also featured on the 2004 single &quot;Wish I Never Knew&quot; by the Scandinavian dance act Slippery People.

<text>Auxonne ( or ) is a commune in the Côte-d&#x27;Or department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of eastern France.

Auxonne is one of the sites of the defensive structures of Vauban, clearly seen from the train bridge as it enters the train station on the Dijon–Vallorbe line railway line. It also was home to the Artillery School where Napoleon Bonaparte was stationed as a lieutenant and audited classes from 1788 to 1791.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Pronunciation==
Due to an exception in the French language, the name is pronounced [osɔn] (In &quot;Aussonne&quot; the &quot;x&quot; is pronounced &quot;ss&quot;). The current spelling of the name comes from a habit of copyists of the Middle Ages who replaced the double &quot;s&quot; by a cross which does not change the pronunciation. This cross, equated with &quot;x&quot; in ancient Greek, was pronounced &quot;ks&quot; in French only from the 18th century but this modification does not change the usage. In practice, however, the pronunciation of Auxonne is debatable, the inhabitants themselves being divided between a pronunciation of &quot;ks&quot; and &quot;ss&quot;: local elected officials as well as SNCF announcements retain the pronunciation &quot;ks&quot;. This pronunciation has the merit of avoiding a homophone with the Upper Garonne commune of Aussonne.

==Geography==
The city of Auxonne is located at the edge of Côte-d&#x27;Or department along the boundary between Burgundy and Franche-Comté some 30 km south-east of Dijon and 45 km west by south-west of Besançon. Access to the commune is by road D905 from Genlis in the north-west which passes through the town and continues south-east to Sampans. The D24 road goes south from the town to Labergement-lès-Auxonne, the D110A goes south-east to Rainans, the D208 goes east to Peintre, and the D20 goes north-east to Flammerans. There are very large forests along the western side of the commune and Auxonne town has a large urban area with the rest of the commune farmland.

The western border of the commune is the Saône river as it flows south to eventually join the Rhône at Lyon. The commune is at an altitude ranging between 181 m and 211 m which makes it virtually immune to floods that envelop the region during major floods.

===Geology===
Auxonne belongs to a region called the plain of Saône. The plain, with Bresse, is a geo-morphological unit of the Bressan depression: an extensive collapsed formation dating from the Miocene extending from the Upper Rhine Plain and the Rhone basin. The plain of Saône is limited in the north by the Upper Saône plateau, to the west by the Burgundian limestone ridge, to the east by the plateaux of the Jura then by the Bresse, and finally to the south by the Beaujolais vineyards. The plain of Saône drops from 250 m altitude in the north to 175 m in the south-east is traversed by the river from north to south for over 150 km.

The city of Auxonne is specifically in the alluvial ribbon called the &quot;Val de Saône&quot; – a band a few kilometres wide that follows the river. Its immediate limit in the Auxonne area is ten kilometres to the east where there is a rise of the &quot;Massif de la Serre&quot; to an altitude of about 400 metres.

===Climate===
The climate of the Val de Saône has several conflicting influences but is still a dominant continental climate. It is marked, however, by an oceanic influence that is strongly attenuated by the hills of Morvan which acts as a barrier. There is also a meridional influence in summer which allows the Saône valley, an extension of the Rhone valley, to enjoy good sunshine which is also seen in late spring and early autumn thereby lengthening the summer. Finally there is the continental influence on the Saône valley climate with cold winters and sometimes late frosts. Fog is common from October to March (65 to 70 days per year). The summers are hot enough. Rainfall is well distributed throughout the year with summer and winter relatively less than autumn and spring.

==History==
===Origins===
Modern historians agree on doubting the veracity of the assertions contained in the &quot;Chronicle of Saint-Pierre de Bèze&quot; (the name of the monastery founded by &quot;Amalgaire&quot; who is referred to as &quot;Amauger&quot; in the &quot;History of Burgundy&quot;) in the first half of the 7th century concerning the term &quot;Assona&quot; to refer to Auxonne in the first half of the 7th century.

The first three authentic instruments where the name &quot;Auxonne&quot; appears date from 1172, 1173 and 1178.

The first two are associated with Count Stephen II of Auxonne (died 1173) and the third is in a bull of Pope Alexander III. The act of 1173 was a donation made by the Count to the monastery of Saint-Vivant de Vergy. The pontifical act of 1178 was a confirmation of all the possessions of the priory of Saint-Vivant which included the town of Auxonne.

Religious rights of Auxonne date back to around 870, the date of establishment of their monastery in the &quot;pagus&quot; (County) of Amous (or Amaous) in the Jura of Burgundy (later called the County of Burgundy then Franche-Comté), six miles from the Saône on land belonging to Agilmar, bishop of Clermont. The place took the name which it still has today: Saint-Vivant-en-Amous (between Auxonne and Dole). The monks remained in Amous for more than twenty years; the Normans from Hastings destroyed the monastery when they invaded Burgundy. Count Manassès built them a new monastery (circa 895–896) in Frankish Burgundy in the County of Beaune on the slopes of Mount Vergy. While they were in Amous they cleared the area and installed fishermen&#x27;s huts along the Saône. According to a hypothesis by some historians, these huts became the germ of the future town of Auxonne. Installed in their remote region of Vergy, far from their difficult to defend lands, the monks of Saint-Vivant felt the need to subordinate (undoubtedly to William IV, Count of Vienne and Mâcon (died 1155)) their lands in Amous to remove the covetousness and retain their rights and properties. According to a second hypothesis, the feudal lord established a new town along Saône which took the name of Auxonne. Auxonne therefore was in the &quot;pagus&quot; of Amous.

The division of the Treaty of Verdun of 843 placed Amous in the prize of Lothair I and, despite the complicated divisions that followed, this county was Holy Roman Empire land and fell within the sphere of influence of the Count of Burgundy – i.e. the future Franche-Comté.

===The attachment to the Duchy of Burgundy===

In 1172 the city had grown in importance: Count Stephen I of Auxonne, the younger branch of Burgundy County and son of William (died 1157), had settled there. His successor Stephen II, Count of Auxonne (died 1241) and son of the previous head of the younger branch of Burgundy County, was master of rich domains, ambitious, powerful, and supported by the premier families of the country, nourished some pretensions to supplant the elder branch. He worked conspicuously. In 1197, taking advantage of unrest in Germany, Stephen III, renounced loyalty to Otto I (died 14 January 1201), and took the Auxonne tribute to the Duke of Burgundy, Odo III, while guaranteeing the rights of Saint-Vivant de Vergy. In return, Odo III promised to help him in his fight against the Palatinate. Auxonne escaped the county movement.

In 1237 the head of the County was Otto III (died 19 June 1248), son and successor of Otto I, Duke of Merania (died 6 May 1234). On 15 June that year, under an exchange agreement concluded at Saint-Jean-de-Losne between John, Count of Chalon (1190-30 September 1267) (the main character of the agreement and son of Stephen III, long associated with his father&#x27;s business and heir of Beatrice de Chalon (1170-7 April 1227) his mother and Stephen III himself) and Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy, the town of Auxonne and all the possessions of Stephen III in the basin of the Saône were transferred to the Duke of Burgundy in exchange for the Barony of Salins and ten strategic positions of the first importance in the County. In coming under the rule of the Dukes of Burgundy, Auxonne became a bridgehead of the duchy on the eastern bank of the Saône, on Holy Roman Empire soil, and escaped the Germanic influence.

The attachment of Auxonne to the Duchy of Burgundy gave it the status as of a border town between the Duchy of Burgundy and the County of Burgundy, between French and Germanic influence that would determine the fate of the town in the following centuries.

===Auxonne under the Dukes of Valois===
Sheltered behind its ramparts that it continued to fortify, the fortress was a major base for launching military operations: it was from Auxonne that Odo IV in 1336 dismissed the threat of dissenting county barons entering as he was their lawful sovereign since his marriage with Jeanne de France (1308–1349), heir to the County. Between 1364 and 1369 there was fighting at the castle of Philip the Bold from Auxonne against the county barons and free companies. At the beginning of the 15th century, with the civil war that ravaged France, war was constant around the walls which forced the city to remain constantly alert. Between 1434 and 1444 there was a new threat: bands of idle soldiers called Écorcheurs because they took all. The people of Auxonne kept watch on the ramparts while the formidable soldiery ravaged the countryside. As if their misfortune were not enough there were two fires five years apart on 7 March 1419 and 15 September 1424 which devastated the city.

It was not until 1444 that there was a period of peace that lasted until the advent of Charles the Bold in 1467.

In 1468, following the Treaty of Peronne, tension revived between the king of France and the Duke of Burgundy – Charles the Bold. The town soon looked to put its defenses in order. In 1471 it made a contribution to the fight against the army of the Dauphiné which was sent by Louis XI and which penetrated the duchy. The adventurous policy of the fiery Duke finally led his dynasty to ruin. On the death of the Duke on 5 January 1477 Louis XI seized the duchy without delay with virtually no resistance. The royal army returned to Dijon on 1 February 1477.

===The attachment to the kingdom of France===
The special status of Outer Saône lands, which were not a domain of the crown given prerogatives, did not stop Louis XI from his conquest. But the Comtois people revolted followed by those from Auxonne. After two years of resistance to the invader and after the carnage of Dole at the Chateau of Dole on 25 May 1479 they were left without support by Mary of Burgundy. Auxonne held out for 12 days in the siege by the royal army commanded by Charles d&#x27;Amboise before opening its doors on 4 June 1477 to the French invader. The town, attached to the crown of France, would share the fate of the monarchy.

The Duchy of Burgundy and the County of Burgundy were always united but this time under the crown of France had changed masters and for another 14 years had a common destiny.

For political ends Louis XI, while he solemnly confirmed the maintenance of all the privileges of the town to ensure the loyalty of his new subjects, hastened to build a mighty fortress, the Chateau d&#x27;Auxonne, at Auxonne at the province&#x27;s expense, which still dominates Iliote square, to guard against any attempt of rebellion.

Charles VIII challenged Louis XI as, while he was engaged to Marguerite, daughter of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian I of Habsburg, heiress of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the dowry of his future wife arrived in the County, he preferred to marry Anne, heiress of Brittany, and thus took the important Duchy of Brittany from the kingdom of France.

===Auxonne becomes a border town===
The Treaty of Senlis (23 May 1493), signed between Charles VIII and Maximilian again separated the two Burgundies. Auxonne again became a French bridgehead on the Imperial Bank and its walls had to protect the kingdom of France against attempts by Habsburg to resolve by force the &quot;question of Burgundy&quot; and the Habsburg claims on Burgundy.

There were soon tensions on the Empire side. From 1494 the Italian wars were rekindled. Again the walls were consolidated and the County door was built in 1503.

===Auxonne repulses the Imperials===
On 14 January 1526 the Treaty of Madrid was signed, after the Battle of Pavia, between François I and Charles V. The King of France was forced to abandon Burgundy and the County of Auxonne, among other territories. The States of Burgundy combined on 8 June 1526 and refused to separate from the crown of France. In response the Emperor tried to conquer the County of Auxonne. In front of the walls of the city Lannoy, commander of the imperial armies, found such strong resistance on the part of all the people he had to give up.

===Henri III declares the Auxonne people guilty of lèse-majesté===
In 1574 Charles of Lorraine, the younger brother of Henri I of Guise and Charles, Duke of Mayenne, whom history remembers simply under the name Mayenne, became Duke and governor of Burgundy. A champion of the Catholic cause, he extended the religious wars to political wars. He worked to establish his own government and attached the neighbouring land of Lorraine under the Guise government to the Burgundian province. The death of the Duke of Anjou, brother of Henry III, in 1584 made Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, the presumptive heir to the crown gave the Catholic League a new activity. Civil war began again. Mayenne sought to retain the strongholds of Burgundy for his County. On 2 April 1585 the people of Auxonne received a letter from King Henry III recommending them to ensure the safety of their town and especially &quot;in not receiving the Duke of Mayenne&quot;.

The people of Auxonne, loyal to the king, hastened to execute orders. Jean de Saulx-Tavannes, governor of the city and the Chateau of Auxonne at first took the measures imposed then secretly strengthened the garrison of the castle as he suspected that the inhabitants of conspiring with Mayenne to deliver it to him instead. Counselled by Joachim de Rochefort, Baron of Pluvault, the magistrates decided to seize the governor. They arrested him on Saints&#x27; Day in 1585 when it was making his devotions in the church. The Count of Charny, a close relative of Jean de Saulx, Lieutenant General in Burgundy, approved this act of loyalty to the Crown by the people of Auxonne. When the King was informed he praised the people for their loyalty but concessions to Leaguers which were formalised by the signing of the Treaty of Nemours on 7 July 1585 forced Henry III to equivocate. He asked the people to deliver Tavannes into the hands of Charny and named Claude de Bauffremont, Baron of Sennecey known for his Mayenne sympathies, as governor of the town and Chateau of Auxonne.

In complete defiance and sniffing betrayal, the people of Auxonne handed Tavannes to the County of Charny who shut him up in his castle at Pagny, refused Sennecey as governor, and continued to claim in his place the Baron of Pluvault. In January 1586 new orders from the king expressed his dissatisfaction with these repeated refusals. The situation was difficult for the people but they received encouragement in their resistance from the future Henri IV who was at Montauban and sent them a letter of encouragement on 25 January 1586. Meanwhile, Tavannes had escaped from his prison at Pagny. The first use he made of his new-found freedom was an attempt to retake Auxonne by surprise. On 10 February 1586 he appeared before the walls with two hundred men at arms. His attempt was unsuccessful.

Despite orders and injunctions that the people receive Sennecey as governor, they still held to Pluvault. His patience tired, Henry III, by letters patent of 1 May 1586, declared the Auxonne people guilty of Lèse-majesté and ordered action by force so arrangements were made accordingly. The Auxonne people were obstinate in their refusal, but loyal to the crown, and were ready for a showdown. They refused to open the gates of the city to the Count of Charny who was obliged to find housing in Tillenay. They did consent to open the gate for President Jeannin who came to mediate with the Squire of Pluvault to save Auxonne from ruin. Jean Delacroix (or John of the Cross), a countryman of Auxonnais and private secretary to Catherine de&#x27; Medici arrived with his deputation to the king with Letters of credence for Sir Charny giving him full powers to deal with the people .

The negotiations resulted in an accord reached and signed on 15 August 1586 at Tillenay. The Treaty revoked letters that declared the people of Auxonne guilty of lese majeste, exempted them from contribution for nine years, and granted a gratuity of 90,000 francs to the Baron of Pluvault. This treaty was approved by letters patent of 19 August 1586 and on the 25th of the same month the Baron of Sennecey was received and installed as governor of the town and Chateau of Auxonne. Received by the people with the greatest distrust, Sennecey showed himself as the man for the job.

===The Treaty of Nijmegen===
The town finally lost its designation as a border town with the conquest of the County by Louis XIV but it still remained an important place as indicated by the stationing there of the 511th logistics regiment.

The city of Auxonne remained famous because of two visits that were made by a young second lieutenant in the regiment of La Fere named Napoleon Bonaparte who was later to make his name known across Europe. The Bonaparte district preserves the room he occupied during one of his stays. There is also a small museum in a tower of the Chateau of Auxonne, his set square, his fencing foil, and objects he offered during his stay, as well as one of his hats.

===Contemporary era===
During the Second World War Auxonne was liberated on 10 September 1944 by troops who landed in Provence.

Built in the south-west corner of the city, the castle has a body for barracks dating from Louis XII and François I which is perhaps the oldest barracks building built for this purpose in France. The castle has five corner towers at the corners connected by thick curtain walls: The Two contiguous towers of Moulins, Beauregard tower, Pied de Biche tower, Chesne tower (now demolished), and the tower of Notre-Dame. The latter is the most massive with three vaulted levels, 20 metres in diameter, 22 metres high, and 6 metre thick walls at the base. (Coordinates: ) The Chateau contains an item that is registered as an historical object:
** A Chimney (16th century)
* The Port Royale (Royal Gate) or Tour du Cygne (Swan Tower) (1775). The Royal Gate dates to the 17th century (1667–1717). During the medieval period the northern entrance to the city was controlled by the Flammerans Portal. When the fortifications were strengthened starting from 1673, the Count of Apremont, who was the engineer, built the Royal Gate to replace the Flammerans Portal. He entrusted the work to Philippe Anglart &quot;architect and contractor for Royal buildings&quot; before having to leave. Upon his return the Count of Apremont was not satisfied with the work and started again. On the Count&#x27;s death in 1678 the work halted and it was Vauban who completed it in 1699. The central pavilion was added on top in 1717. On the city side the central body is flanked by two perfectly identical houses, covered with a Mansart roof. The opening to the countryside is surmounted by a trophy of arms.

* The Port of Comté (15th century) is located east of the city. This superb example of military architecture dates from the reign of Louis XII and had decorations comparable to that on the emergency door in the Chateau of Dijon which has now disappeared. The exterior face of the gate there is a shield of France supported by two angels and porcupines which are royal symbols.
* The Arsenal (1674) was originally used to provide gun carriages. It was built by Vauban between 1689 and 1693. It has preserved its original plan which is now three buildings, one of which serves as a covered market.

;Other military sites of interest
* The Ramparts were mentioned in the charter of 1229: at that time there were simple earthen ramparts bordered by a ditch and surmounted by piles of thorns. In the first half of the 14th century, at great sacrifice for the population, the city was surrounded with a wall which lasted comfortably until the intervention of the Count of Apremont in 1673. This medieval walls covering a perimeter of 2600 metres and included 23 towers, turrets, and a fortified bridge. The front overlooking the Saône was very difficult to build and was undertaken from 1411. The wall was the pride of the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, who stated in letters patent of 23 December 1424: &quot;The place of our city Auxonne is beautiful, strong, and well closed with walls and ditches&quot;. In 1479, on becoming master of Burgundy, Louis XI built a fortified chateau adapted to the progress of artillery with the appearance of a metallic ball. Auxonne was in a strategic position as a border town and had to endure continual wars with the County becoming Imperial Land after the Treaty of Senlis in 1493. The medieval ramparts were the subject of care and continual reinforcement in the 16th century under Louis XII and François I. With Louis XIV and the wars of conquest by the County, the strategic interest of the town brought the king to put the city &quot;in a state not to fear the attacks of the enemy&quot;. In 1673 it was François de la Motte-Villebret, Count of Apremont, from Tours who was responsible. He destroyed almost all of the medieval walls to establish a defence system by Vauban, part of which still exists today. Apremont died in 1678 and it was Vauban who succeeded him to ensure completion of the works. He raised a magnificent project that complemented the work of Count Apremont but on the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 he lost interest and the project was never completed.
* The Belvoir Tower (or Tour Belvoir). Of the 23 towers of the medieval walls, there remains today only three and of these Belvoir tower is the only one that has not been subject to significant changes.
* The Sign tower (Tour de Signe) on which there is a salamander, the emblem of François I.
* The Statue of Lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte in bronze by François Jouffroy was opened in December 1857 in the centre of the Place d&#x27;Armes. Bonaparte is shown with a youthful face in the uniform of an artillery officer. The base is decorated with four different reliefs (Bonaparte in the Chapel of the Levée, Bonaparte at the Battle of Arcole, the coronation ceremony of Napoleon, and a meeting of the Council of State).
* The Barracks, made of pink Moissey stone where Bonaparte occupied successively two bedrooms. They are now occupied by the 511th Logistics Regiment.

<text>HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; (D86) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was named in honour of the Battle of Agincourt, fought in 1415 during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. &quot;Agincourt&quot; was built by R. &amp; W. Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Company Limited on the River Tyne. She was launched on 29 January 1945 and commissioned on 25 June 1947.

==Service==
She joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet based in the UK. On 23 June 1948, &quot;Agincourt&quot; collided with the naval Motor Fishing Vessel &quot;MFV 1161&quot;, breaking off a length of deck plating from the destroyer. In 1951, &quot;Agincourt&quot; became Captain (D), meaning she was the leader of the flotilla. On 14 July 1951, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was in collision with sister ship . A length of planking was torn off from &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s port side, while &quot;Cadiz&quot;″s starboard anchor was damaged.

In 1953 &quot;Agincourt&quot; took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In December 1954, &quot;Agincourt&quot;, along with the rest of the squadron, formerly flotilla, deployed to the Mediterranean, where she was deployed until October 1955, when the Squadron returned to home waters. In 1956 &quot;Agincourt&quot; formed part of the Royal Navy force which took part in the Suez Crisis. In 1957, &quot;Agincourt&quot;, and the 4th Destroyer Squadron, returned to the Mediterranean.

==Refit and conversion to radar picket==
In 1959, &quot;Agincourt&quot; and three of her sister-ships underwent conversion to become radar pickets. The conversion included the addition of the Sea Cat missile and new radar, as well as newer anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1962, &quot;Agincourt&quot; returned to active duty and saw service in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets with a variety of squadrons. On 16 November 1962 &quot;Agincourt&quot; took part in the search for a helicopter from the aircraft carrier that had ditched off St David&#x27;s Head in South west Wales (and in particular, the politician Lord Windlesham who was missing after the crash), and on the next day, was refuelling at Milford Haven when she was ordered to go to the aid of the replenishment tanker , which was in difficulty while being towed in heavy seas off Hartland Point on the coast of Devon. By the time &quot;Agincourt&quot; reached Hartland Point, &quot;Green Ranger&quot;″s towline had parted, and the tanker had run aground. &quot;Agincourt&quot; illuminated &quot;Green Ranger&quot; with searchlights while the Appledore lifeboat attempted to rescue the seven men aboard &quot;Green Ranger&quot;, until they were taken off by Breeches buoy from the shore.

In 1966, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was reduced to Operational Reserve, and was subsequently placed on the disposal list in 1972. She was broken up in Sunderland in 1974.

<text>John De Hart (July 25, 1727 – June 1, 1795) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from Elizabeth, New Jersey. He represented New Jersey as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775 and signed the Continental Association.

==Biography==
De Hart was born at Elizabethtown (since renamed as Elizabeth, New Jersey) to Jacob De Hart (1699–1777) and Abigail (Crane) De Hart. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1770. He married Sarah Dagworthy, and they had eight children (John, Jacob, Matthias, Stephen, Sarah, Abigail, Jane, and Louisa).

In 1774 he was named as a delegate to the First Continental Congress. While he supported the non-importation agreement and the first petition to the King, he was in favor of reconciliation. He was returned to the Second Congress in 1775, but as differences with Great Britain became more pronounced, the Congress began to adopt a harder line. Finally, on November 13, 1775, he wrote his resignation to the New Jersey General Assembly, and they accepted it on November 22.

In 1776, New Jersey began crafting an independent government. De Hart attended the convention and served on the committee that drafted the New Jersey State Constitution in June. He was appointed to serve on the New Jersey Supreme Court on September 4, 1776, but also made a living practicing law. Governor William Livingston replaced him in February 1777 for failing to attend court sessions.

De Hart&#x27;s last act of public service was as Mayor of Elizabeth, New Jersey (then Elizabethtown). He was elected in November 1789 and served until his death. He died at his home in 1795 and is buried in St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard in Elizabeth. The home that he built in 1766 and lived in for 29 years was called the &quot;De Hart House&quot; and stood at the intersection of Rahway Avenue and Cherry Street in Elizabeth.

His daughter Abigail married John Mayo, a prominent Virginia planter, and had a daughter, Maria D. Mayo, who was married to General Winfield Scott.

<text>Chalon-sur-Saône (, literally &quot;Chalon on Saône&quot;) is a city in the Saône-et-Loire department in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. It is the largest city in the department; however, the department capital is the smaller city of Mâcon.

==Geography==
Chalon-sur-Saône lies in the south of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté and in the east of France, approximately north of Mâcon. It is located on the Saône river, and was once a busy port, acting as a distribution point for local wines which were sent up and down the Saône river and the Canal du Centre, opened in 1792.

===Ancient times===
Though the site (ancient &quot;Cabillonum&quot;) was a capital of the Aedui and objects of La Tène culture have been retrieved from the bed of the river here, the first mention of &quot;Cavillonum&quot; is found in Commentarii de Bello Gallico (VII, chs. 42 and 90). The Roman city already served as a river port and hub of road communications, of the Via Agrippa and side routes. 
In 354 AD the Roman Emperor Constantius II stationed the Roman 7th Army in Chalon (then called Cabyllona) for an invasion against the brother kings, Gundomadus and Vadomarius of the Alamanni. However, not having received supplies, the Roman troops revolted, and were pacified by the grand chamberlain Eusebius with money. In Late Antiquity the city had dwindled so much that a wall round it encircled fifteen hectares.

===Christian centre===
Saint Marcellus of Chalon (&quot;Saint Marcel&quot;) is said to have been martyred here in 179 AD. Chalon became one of the &quot;de facto&quot; capitals of the kingdom of Burgundy under Guntram, king from 561 to 592, who died here. Guntram also promoted the cult of Saint Marcellus. It continued to pay for its importance by being frequently attacked until the 10th century. The bishopric of Chalon-sur-Saône, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon, was also established here in the 6th century, and a Church Council was held here from 644–655. After the French Revolution, in accordance with the Concordat of 1801, the diocese of Chalon was amalgamated with the diocese of Autun, which gave the name to the new entity.

===Modern developments===
Chalon in the 19th century is best known as the birthplace of photography. Its most famous resident, Nicéphore Niépce, also has a lycée (secondary school) named after him. There is a museum which contains some early photography relics, located on the &quot;Quai des Messageries&quot; in the town, containing more than two million photographs and many old artefacts such as cameras and other equipment for old and modern photography. Also on display are Niépce&#x27;s 1807 Pyréolophore, which is probably the world&#x27;s first internal combustion engine, plus his 1818 implementation of a dandy horse, for which he coined the word vélocipède.
Another famous resident is Dominique Vivant Denon (1747–1825), who was involved in the creation of the Louvre museum, converting the former royal palace into a museum after the French Revolution.

In the late 19th century, copper and iron works were the town&#x27;s main industry. The large engineering works of Petit-Creusot, a branch of those of Le Creusot, manufactured heavy industrial items.

<text>Ilhabela (Portuguese for &quot;Beautiful Island&quot;) is an archipelago and city situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of São Paulo state in Brazil. The city is from the city of São Paulo and from the city of Rio de Janeiro. The largest island, although commonly called &quot;Ilhabela&quot;, is officially named &quot;Ilha de São Sebastião&quot; (&quot;St. Sebastian Island&quot;). It, the other islands (Búzios, Pescadores and Vitória) and the islets (Cabras, Castelhanos, Enchovas, Figueira, Lagoa and Serraria) make up the municipality of Ilhabela.

Ilhabela is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. The population is 35,591 (2020 est.). The islands in total cover . During the holiday months, up to one hundred thousand people may be on the island, since it is a popular destination for tourists. To access the city, one must take a boat or ferry in São Sebastião, as there are no roads which reach it. During the summer, one may wait several hours to take the ferry boat. The ferry takes 15 minutes to cross the channel between the two cities.

== History ==
=== Pre-colonial period and indigenous occupations ===
For at least 2,000 years before the arrival of the Portuguese, the archipelago had been inhabited by sambaqui indigenous peoples, and by ceramist peoples for at least 700 years.

These early inhabitants were fishermen and collectors who lived in open-air camps near beaches and bays. Their collections of shells, shellfish and ceramics are the only traces of their existence available for researchers to study them. They deduce these peoples would not consume much of the forests of the islands, probably picking no more than fruits and ingredients for remedies.

Before the Portuguese arrived, these tribes were replaced by tupi-guarani and jês peoples, who had mastered ceramic and agricultural techniques and left the only traces of an indigenous village, at the so called &quot;Vianna site&quot; on the main island (São Sebastião Island). These tribes would take shelter under rocks during hunting and exploration expeditions.

=== Colonial Brazil period: sugar cane, gold export and pirate attacks ===
The first documented non-indigenous visit to the island was an expedition involving Italian cosmographer Amerigo Vespucci that arrived there on 20 January 1502. As with several other geographical features discovered by the Portuguese, the island was named after the saint of the day (Saint Sebastian).

Around that time, the island would provide shelter for pirates and corsairs coming mainly from England, France and the Netherlands. They would explore the island for firewood, food and water. They carried out a number of attacks against Portuguese ships and settlements (namely Santos, São Vicente and Bertioga), which cost Portugal several quantities of gold and other precious stones until the 17th century. Such events gave birth to legends of hidden treasures scattered around the city&#x27;s territory.

Between 1588 and 1590 Edward Fenton and Thomas Cavendish went to the island. The latter was accompanied by John Davis, who had sought shelter in the island following a defeat in Vitória, Espírito Santo, only to lose even more men in a battle against the Portuguese. Another source says he actually took shelter in August 1591 in Ilhabela after looting Santos and São Vicente and only went to Vitória afterwards.

The first known land grant in Ilhabela happened in 1603 and extended into the 17th century. Around that time, the most common product to be cultivated and then exported to the metropolis was sugarcane, common throughout São Paulo&#x27;s coastline, and planted in the areas facing the continent and even in more distant islands, such as Vitória and Búzios. The planting of sugarcane and production of sugar gained a boost between the 17th and 18th centuries and caused considerable deforestation.

With the development of slave trade, the channel between the island and the continent became a common route for slave ships. According to accounts from that time, some enslaved Africans managed to flee and established the first quilombos in the region, in distant areas of dense forests.

Between the 17th and 18th centuries, São Sebastião village was an important port to outflow gold found in areas now within Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás. In order to provide protection for the ships leaving the coast, security around the channel was improved with forts, trenches and artilleries. The placing of these structures may have contributed to the establishment of the first white settlements in the area, still in the 17th century, which happened simultaneously to more sesmarias grants by the Portuguese. Such land would be used to grow sugarcane, tobacco and wild indigo.

Around that time, and also because of prosperous mining activities, the first whaling station of the Captaincy of São Paulo was built in Ponta das Canavieiras. It was believed to have focused on the local demand and that the facilities were granted by the Portuguese crown via a system under which the whaling station owners would invest in equipment and gear and, after ten years, everything would be claimed by the royal treasure.

The Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro restricted olive oil ships in its waters, believing that the northern coastline of São Paulo was actually devoted to gold smuggling. 
Therefore, from 1734 on, whales began to be killed for oil. Around 1850, as the animal became more and more rare, the hunting of whales and the whaling station were abandoned.

=== Transition from sugar to coffee and economic leadership ===
Showing increasing political, social and economical relevance, due to the boom in agricultural and commercial activities, São Sebastião Island was promoted by António José da Franca e Horta (who governed São Paulo at that time) in 1805 to village status and was then renamed as &quot;Villa Bella da Princesa&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Island of the Princess&quot;).

Throughout the 19th century, activities concerning sugarcane began to decay, but they were soon replaced by coffee, following a trend seen around the rest of the Paraíba Valley. Production concentrated in Ponta do Boi, in the south part of the island, more precisely at Nossa Senhora das Galhetas, Figueira e Sombrio Farm. Growing coffee resulted in an even more intense deforestation than that caused by sugarcane, and the plants could be cultivated in altitudes higher than 500 meters, by the main island&#x27;s escarpments.

In 1854, the island had a population of 10,769, concentrated on the continent-facing side. There were 225 farms in which 1775 enslaved people were forced to work; the village&#x27;s production around that time was greater than that of any coastal municipality of São Paulo.

The coffee era in the area came to its end with the abolishment of slavery in Brazil and the island&#x27;s economy saw a return to engenho activities (there were 36 engenhos in Ilhabela back then), only this time they would shift focus from sugar to aguardiente. Most of the latter would be exported in small quantities via the Port of Santos. The locals themselves would take the products to the port in canoes known as &quot;vogas&quot;; the knowledge to build them was inherited from the indigenous peoples who inhabited the area in the past. The São Paulo Geographical and Geological Commission left the following account on these boats:

Assembling these boats meant more deforestation, since the big and straight trees in the area - namely: ingá, custard, bocuíba-açú, coabí, Brazilian firetree, jequitibá, canela-moscada, canela-batalha, pau-d&#x27;alho, fig tree - were ideal to the vogas. Besides that, other trees had to be taken down throughout the whole process: some to open a path for the trunks to be transported, others so their trunks could be used as some sort of conveyor belt and some simply because their crowns were intertwined with the desired trees&#x27;. Production was so intense the village became the main voga manufacturing center of São Paulo coastline up to the 20th century.

A new production decline affected the island and was followed by a period of economic stagnation. By the 1920s, Japanese immigrants settled in the island ad brought international technologies; simultaneously, the arrival of the motor boat and surrounding nets gave local fishing activities a boost, since they were previously restricted to where traditional methods functioned efficiently. As such, the usage of vogas became increasingly obsolete.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, fishing helped the island become a local power again. Saco do Sombrio, previously used as anchorage point for slave ships and for long deserted, became the largest fishing port of the island. It would provide shelter from strong winds to up to 20-25 boats at once and would be home to 450-500 people. The place became so important that it was promoted to district status in 1944, along with Búzios, Vitória and Pescadores islands (under the collective name of &quot;Paranabi&quot;). Aside from fishing, handicraft products and seaweed collecting also gained strength. The latter was taught by the Japanese and reached its peak between 1925 and 1932.

=== Economic downfall and rise with tourism ===
From the 1930s on, the village suffered the consequences of the world crisis consolidated around that time, which joined the Constitutionalist Revolution and the consequent sea block which São Paulo was subjected to. Japanese immigrants left the area, causing many fishermen and crew members to become unemployed. From 1933 to 1938, fish around the island suddenly disappeared, increasing their poverty. As the state&#x27;s countryside became ready for exploration with the opening of new roads and railways, many migrated in search of better opportunities. This exodus contributed to a recovery trend seen on the local forests.

Local land was sold at devalued prices and, from the 1960s on, tourism rose as an option to save the island&#x27;s economy. The local infrastructure was improved and Ilhabela began to be sold as &quot;symbol of adventure, pleasure and the wild&quot;.

Tourism and real estate speculation became new threats to the local forests, which prompted environmentalists to demand the creation of special reserves in the island, which gave birth to the Ilhabela State Park in the 1970s. According to a 2005 research, tourism, along with activities at the Port of São Sebastião and the local Petrobrás Terminal, became the main local vectors of environmental pressure. More recently, in 2011, exploitation points of the Pre-salt layer joined the previous vectors.

Among the current critical issues of the island, is the lack of proper sewage pipes to collect all houses&#x27; wastewater. As of January 2012, 46,6% of the buildings in the island lacked such infrastructure. In February 2016, the city hall announced R$12 million to be invested in sewer systems for the southern part of the city. By the time it was announced, Ilhabela was the worst coastal municipality in the state of São Paulo in terms of sanitary treatment, according to a research by the State Secretary of the Environment - 35% of the city&#x27;s sewer is collected, pre-conditioned and released on the sea, according to the secretary, while the city hall claims 61% of the city is covered by sewer systems.

== Geography ==
=== Territory ===

The main islands of the archipelago are São Sebastião (33737 ha), Búzios (739 ha), Vitória (219 ha) dos Pescadores (20 ha) - all of which inhabited. There are also the very small islets (das Cabras, da Sumítica, da Serraria, dos Castelhanos, da Lagoa, da Figueira and das Enchovas islands). Almost all the urbanized areas are in the very narrow plains between the sea and the mountains of the main island, preferably at the west part, facing the continent.

A short (30 km) but high mountain range forms this main island, reaching above 1,000 meters in seven different points - &quot;Pico de São Sebastião&quot; (1,378 m), &quot;Morro do Papagaio&quot; (1,302 m), &quot;Pico da Serraria&quot; (1,285 m), &quot;Morro do Ramalho&quot; (1,205 m), &quot;Morro do Simão&quot; (1,102 m), &quot;Morro das Tocas&quot; 1,079 m) and &quot;Pico do Baepi&quot; (1,048 m). Running approximately 8 km into the Atlantic Ocean off the southeast corner of the island, there is the Península do Boi (&quot;Ox Peninsula&quot;). The east side of the island is inhabited by very few people, who concentrates mainly on the Castelhanos beach, the only on this side accessible by road. Only 4x4 jeeps are able to cross this particular road, though.)
Vitória, dos Pescadores and Búzios islands are 38, 37 and 24 km off the continent, respectively. Buzios and Vitória islands, 7½ and 2½ km away from the northeastern tip of the main island, respectively, are home to 142 and 50 &quot;caiçaras&quot;, respectively. Only canoes are able to go to the island, since the piers available are in poor condition. Both islands have traces of indigenous cemeteries. The locals will plant and grow their own food, though the number of fish is decreasing, but Búzios Island has two markets. There&#x27;s no drinking water and people normally urinate and defecate on the vegetation.

The islands possess no medical structures and locals depend on the periodic visits of team sent by the city hall, comprising doctors, nurses, dentists and psychologists. The islands are so isolated the government contemplated building a prison on one of them in the early 20th century. One of the engineers hired to analyze the possibility was Euclides da Cunha, who left the following comment about Vitória Island: &quot;[the island has] capacity for a settlement several times larger, its abandonment being explained by its distance&quot;.

=== Fauna and flora ===

The fauna and flora in Ilhabela prompted the government to create the Ilhabela State Park on 20 January 1977 via the state decree 9414, establishing is area in 27,025 hectares (which corresponds to 84,3% of the municipality&#x27;s territory, including a large portion of the main island, 11 other islands, three islets, three lajes and one placer). The park&#x27;s importance made it be considered a bioshpere reserve by UNESCO, a Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) area of interest and an Important Bird Area (IBA).

A 2015 research by Fundação Florestal listed 1,569 flora species within the park.

Ilhabela is home to endemic species such as the Giant Atlantic tree-rat, the serpents &quot;Siphonops insulanus&quot; and &quot;Liotyphlops caissara&quot; and tegus (&quot;Tupinambis merianae sebastiani&quot; and &quot;Tupinambis merianae buzionensis&quot;, the latter is endemic to the Búzios island), also being a point of observation of 66 bird species exclusive to the Atlantic Forest (five of them considered globally endangered in 2015).

There are also historical accounts of the presence of jaguars on the island. The first dates back to 1562, when José de Anchieta wrote in a letter to King Sebastian that the island was deserted, but contained &quot;many tigers&quot; (Portuguese explorers were more familiar with African and Asian animals, which they would use as parameters). Another account comes from 1877, then the local population killed the last known jaguar on the island, which supposedly swam all the way from the continent. Finally, it is known that in 1912 the São Paulo Geographical and Geological Commission registered one particular place with the name &quot;Pedra da Onça&quot; (Jaguar Rock).

Urban occupation is seen as a potential threat to the preservation of local species. Structures such as the Castelhanos road, which allows terrestrial vehicles to access Castelhanos Beach on the other side of the island, concern specialists, who recommend caution when allowing visitors into the area.

=== Hydrography ===
2015 research by Fundação Florestal showed that, although the quality of water around is good due to the dense forests, it may be affected by intense tourism and the presence of caiçara communities lacking proper sewer systems.

=== Climate ===
Most of the city has a tropical climate, but the mountains have an oceanic climate, because of the high altitude. The Atlantic Forest covers the entire city.

A distinct feature of the local climate is the difference in the relative humidity of both sides of the island. The high mountains that form the territory of the main island function as a wall against clouds, forcing them to go up and allowing for the condensation of steam and causing orographic rains.

== Tourism ==

Ilhabela is a popular sailing point. Several regattas take place at the city&#x27;s coast. Also, it is popular for many other watersports, including scuba and free diving. The waters around the archipelago are filled with more than 50 shipwrecks, six of them being opened for visiting via diving. Cetacean diversity is rich in the areas, and whale watchings targeting such as humpback whales, bryde&#x27;s whales, minke whales, southern right whales, orcas, and dolphins are also available.

There are many hiking trails with varying degrees of difficulty and 360 waterfalls in the Atlantic jungle.

=== Beaches ===

There are 41 beaches on the main island. The ones located along the channel are in general urbanized and feature calm to moderate waves. The ones facing the ocean are clean and less affected by humans, besides featuring stronger waves, which attracts surfers. These can only be reached by foot and/or by boat, the exception being Castelhanos, as explained above. Bonete was considered the ninth best beach of Brazil by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Starting from Castelhanos and going counterclockwise, the beaches are:

* dos Castelhanos
* Saco do Eustáquio
* Guanxuma
* da Caveira
* da Serraria
* do Poço
* da Fome
* Jabaquara
* Pacuíba
* da Armação

* Grande
* do Curral
* do Veloso
* Bonete
* Enchovas
* Indaiúba
* Saco do Sombrio
* da Figueira
* Vermelha
* Mansa
== Economy ==
The municipality&#x27;s economy is based on tourism, commerce and civil construction, with fishing, handicraft and public service coming as secondary economical activities. In 2016, it was ranked among the ten best Brazilian municipalities in terms of tax management by a FIRJAN index.

== Transportation ==
The only way to access the island by car is via the ferry boats that cross the channel. Each boat carries up to 70 vehicles and takes 15 minutes to sail through the 2.4 kilometers that separate the two stations.

The SP-131 is the main road on the main island, running from the southwestern coast of the island to its northern coast.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="629461" wikidata="Q17125543" url="?curid=629461" title="Short squeeze">
<text>In the stock market, a short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals. A short squeeze occurs when demand has increased relative to supply because short sellers have to buy stock to cover their short positions.

==Overview==
Short selling is a finance practice in which an investor, known as the short-seller, borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping to buy them back later (&quot;covering&quot;) at a lower price. As the shares were borrowed, the short-seller must eventually return them to the lender (plus interest and dividend, if any), and therefore makes a profit if they spend less buying back the shares than they received when selling them. However, an unexpected piece of favorable news can cause a jump in the stock&#x27;s share price, resulting in a loss rather than a profit. Short-sellers might then be triggered to buy the shares they had borrowed at a higher price, in an effort to keep their losses from mounting should the share price rise further. 

Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Purchasing the stock to cover their short positions raises the price of the shorted stock, thus triggering more short sellers to cover their positions by buying the stock; i.e., there is increasing demand. This dynamic can result in a cascade of stock purchases and an even bigger jump of the share price. Borrow, buy and sell timing can lead to more than 100% of a company&#x27;s shares sold short. This does not necessarily imply naked short selling, since shorted shares are put back onto the market, potentially allowing the same share to be borrowed multiple times.

Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. Expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon.

Buying by short sellers can occur if the price has risen to a point where shorts receive margin calls that they cannot (or choose not to) meet, triggering them to purchase stock to return to the owners from whom (via a broker) they had borrowed the stock in establishing their position. This buying may proceed automatically, for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility. Alternatively, short sellers simply deciding to cut their losses and get out (rather than lacking collateral funds to meet their margin) can cause a squeeze. Short squeezes can also occur when the demand from short sellers outweighs the supply of shares to borrow, which results in the failure of borrow requests from prime brokers. This sometimes happens with companies that are on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.

===Targets for short squeezes===
Short squeezes are more likely to occur in stocks with relatively few traded shares and commensurately small market capitalization and float. Squeezes can, however, involve large stocks and billions of dollars. Short squeezes may also be more likely to occur when a large percentage of a stock&#x27;s float is short, and when large portions of the stock are held by people not tempted to sell.

Short squeezes can also be facilitated by the availability of inexpensive call options on the underlying security because they add considerable leverage. Typically, out of the money options with a short time to expiration are used to maximize the leverage and the impact of the squeezer&#x27;s actions on short sellers. Call options on securities that have low implied volatility are also less expensive and more impactful. (A successful short squeeze will dramatically increase implied volatility).

===Long squeeze ===
The opposite of a short squeeze is the less common long squeeze. A squeeze can also occur with futures contracts, especially in agricultural commodities, for which supply is inherently limited.

===Gamma squeeze===
The sale of naked call options creates a short position for the seller, in which the seller&#x27;s loss increases with the price of the underlying asset and is therefore potentially unlimited. Sellers have the option of hedging their position by, among other things, buying the underlying asset at a known price at any time before the option is exercised, converting their naked calls into covered calls. By buying calls, per unit of capital invested, the buyer can create a larger upward pressure on the price of the underlying than they could by buying shares: this pressure is in fact realized when the seller purchases the underlying, and is greater if the seller invests more capital hedging their position by buying the (expensive) underlying than the buyer invests to purchase the (inexpensive) calls.

The resulting upward pressure on the price of the underlying can develop into a positive feedback loop, as call-sellers react to the rising price by buying the underlying to avoid exposure to the risk that its price may rise further.

==Examples==
In May 1901, James J. Hill and J. P. Morgan battled with E. H. Harriman over control of the Northern Pacific Railway. By the end of business on May 7, 1901, the two parties controlled over 94% of outstanding Northern Pacific shares. The resulting runup in share price was accompanied by frenetic short selling of Northern Pacific by third parties. On May 8, it became apparent that uncommitted NP shares were insufficient to cover the outstanding short positions, and that neither Hill and Morgan nor Harriman were willing to sell. This triggered a sell-off in the rest of the market as NP &quot;shorts&quot; liquidated holdings in an effort to raise cash to buy NP shares to meet their obligations. The ensuing stock market crash, known as the Panic of 1901, was partially ameliorated by a truce between Hill/Morgan and Harriman.

In October 2008, a short squeeze triggered by an attempted takeover by Porsche temporarily drove the shares of Volkswagen AG on the Xetra DAX from €210.85 to over €1000 in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Then-Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation but was acquitted by a Stuttgart court.

In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Philip Falcone with market manipulation in relation to a short squeeze on a series of high-yield bonds issued by MAAX Holdings. After hearing that a firm was shorting the bonds, Falcone purchased the entire issue of bonds. He also lent the bonds to the short-sellers, and then bought them back when the traders sold them. As a result, his total exposure exceeded the entire issue of the MAAX bonds. Falcone then stopped lending the bonds, so that short-sellers could not liquidate their positions anymore. The price of the bonds rose dramatically. The short-sellers could only liquidate their positions by contacting Falcone directly.

In November 2015, Martin Shkreli orchestrated a short squeeze on failed biotech KaloBios (KBIO) that caused its share price to rise by 10,000% in just five trading days. KBIO had been perceived by short sellers as a &quot;no-brainer near-term zero&quot;.

The GameStop short squeeze, starting in January 2021, was a short squeeze occurring on shares of GameStop, primarily triggered by the Reddit forum WallStreetBets. This squeeze led to the share price reaching an all-time intraday high of US$483 on January 28, 2021 on the NYSE. This squeeze caught the attention of many news networks and social media platforms.

In March 2022, a short squeeze was initiated on nickel contracts on the London Metal Exchange (LME). In the months prior, industrialist Xiang Guangda took a large short position on LME nickel, but a rise in nickel prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced Guangda make significant purchases to cover his position, causing LME nickel prices to rise by around 250 percent. On paper this would&#x27;ve caused Guangda billions of dollars of losses, but the LME halted all trading on nickel contracts and reversed many of the trades which occurred during the squeeze, shielding Guangda from much of the loss.
