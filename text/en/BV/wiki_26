<text>St Albans () is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Brimbank local government area. In the 2021 census, St Albans recorded a population of 38,042 people.

St Albans&#x27; main commercial and shopping precinct is located on Main Road West, Main Road East, Alfrieda Street, the railway station and East Esplanade. The postcode is 3021.

==History==

St Albans was first established as a township in 1887 and originally subdivided by the Cosmopolitan Land and Banking Company, who had acquired in the hope of a quick financial gain during that period&#x27;s land boom. Manager Alfred Padley made an arrangement with Victorian Railways to build the railway station, which he insisted be named St Albans after his maternal ancestors&#x27; association with St Albans Cathedral, England. Padley built and resided in Kieglo, which later became the Presbytery of the Sacred Heart . The company was later liquidated in 1903.

St Albans was promoted as an attractive location for professionals, providing easy rail access to central Melbourne and adjoining suburbs. St Albans Post Office opened on 22 October 1888. 

St Albans became a small dormitory suburb for growing industrial firms in Deer Park and Sunshine. Despite the Great Depression, development was steady and, by 1940, around 700 people lived in the town. In the years following World War II, the population rapidly increased with the arrival of displaced migrants, particularly from Yugoslavia, Malta and Italy. This led to additional state schools and the 1953 establishment of Sacred Heart Catholic Church, as well as Greek, Russian and Serbian Orthodox churches.

St Albans remained geographically isolated from other suburbs by large areas of open land until the 1980s. It is now considered to be a middle-city suburb as the Melbourne Metropolitan area boundary now extends to over from the Melbourne CBD.

==Demographics==

In the 2016 census, St Albans recorded a population of 37,309 people, 49.6% female and 50.4% male.

==Flora and fauna==

Great parks are located on the East and West borders of the suburb. These areas (particularly in the West) used to have large healthy populations of native reptiles, including Tiger snake, Eastern blue-tongued lizard and Eastern brown snake. Unfortunately due to development these species are now rarely seen in the area.

Due to development of the Cairnlea estate on the southern border of St Albans, native species of frogs have taken advantage and have taken up residence in the new wetlands and lakes. The Eastern Banjo Frog, common eastern froglet and even the now endangered growling grass frog have been seen and heard in the new wetlands and around Kororoit Creek.

<text>Sunshine is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Brimbank local government area. Sunshine recorded a population of 9,445 at the .

Sunshine, initially a town just outside Melbourne, is today a residential suburb with a mix of period and post-War homes, with a town centre that is an important retail centre in Melbourne&#x27;s west. It is also one of Melbourne&#x27;s principal places of employment outside the CBD with many industrial companies situated in the area, and is an important public transport hub with both V/Line and Metro services at Sunshine railway station and its adjacent major bus interchange.

==History==


===19th century===
The farms and settlements in the area now known as Sunshine first came under the Sunshine Road District (1860–1871) which later became the Shire of Braybrook (1871–1951).

From 1860 to 1885 the only railway which passed through the area was the Bendigo line and the only railway station in the area was Albion &amp; Darlington (opened 5 January 1860) at the site of the current Albion station. When the Ballarat line was built through the area, a new station was built at the junction of the two lines: this station opened on 7 September 1885 and was called Braybrook Junction as it was in the Shire of Braybrook.

The area around the Braybrook Junction railway station then came to be known as Braybrook Junction. The Braybrook Junction Post Office opened on 25 August 1890.

===20th century===
====Pre-war Sunshine====
In 1904 H. V. McKay bought a factory in the area called the Braybrook Implement Works. He also secured of land at Braybrook Junction with the aim of establishing housing to allow his future workers to live in the area, along the lines of a company town. The land became the &quot;Sunshine Estate&quot; (see below).

In 1906 McKay moved his agricultural machinery manufacturing business from Ballarat to his newly acquired factory in Braybrook Junction. The factory was renamed the Sunshine Harvester Works and it became the largest manufacturing plant in Australia.

In July 1907, the train station, the post office, and the shire riding&#x27;s names were changed from Braybrook Junction to Sunshine after workers and residents had petitioned to do so in honour of McKay&#x27;s Sunshine Harvester Works.

Also in 1907 an industrial dispute between owner H. V. McKay and his workers at the Sunshine Harvester Works led to the Harvester Judgement, the benchmark industrial decision which led to the creation of a minimum living wage for Australian workers.

The Sunshine train disaster on 20 April 1908 killed 44 people at Sunshine station.

In 1909, the H. V. McKay Sunshine Harvester Works Pipe Band was formed. This is one of Australia&#x27;s oldest continuously functioning pipe bands and still exists as the Victoria Scottish Pipes &amp; Drums.

Prue McGoldrick&#x27;s &quot;My Paddock: An Early Twentieth Century Childhood&quot; is a memoir of growing up in Sunshine.

====The Sunshine Estate and H. V. McKay&#x27;s civic works====
The land that H. V. McKay had earlier purchased to build housing for his workers on was developed by McKay as the Sunshine Estate. This housing estate was developed with superficial similarity to some street plans of cities created by followers of the Garden city movement, an influential town planning movement of the early 20th century. Infrastructure and amenities established by McKay for the Sunshine Estate and the rest of Sunshine included electric street lighting, parks and sporting grounds, public buildings, schools, and a library. The town of Sunshine (not a suburb of Melbourne at this point) became regarded as a model industry-centred community. Housing for the McKay&#x27;s employees swelled the local population and the town of Sunshine was touted as the &quot;Birmingham of Australia&quot;.

====Post-war Sunshine====
After WWII, Sunshine increasingly became connected to the sprawling city of Melbourne as car-based travel enabled people to leave the inner city suburbs and move into houses on larger blocks in suburbia. In 1951, the old Shire of Braybrook was abolished and the City of Sunshine was established.

Sunshine was not immune when many Australian-based manufacturing industries started winding down during and after the 1970s. In 1992, the Massey Ferguson factory, formerly the Sunshine Harvester Works, was demolished to make way for the development of the Sunshine Marketplace.

On 15 December 1994, the City of Sunshine was abolished and Sunshine became part of the newly created City of Brimbank.

===21st century===
Sunshine is now both a low-density residential suburb and one of Melbourne&#x27;s principal places of employment outside the CBD. Many heavy and light industrial companies are situated in and around the area and it is an important retail centre in Melbourne&#x27;s west. In addition to Sunshine&#x27;s street shopping strips there are two shopping centres, the Sunshine Plaza and the Sunshine Marketplace. There is a Village Cinemas multiplex, the &quot;Village 20 Sunshine Megaplex&quot;, at the Sunshine Marketplace.

Educational institutions in Sunshine include Victoria Polytechnic (the TAFE division of Victoria University). Secondary schools include Sunshine College and Harvester Technical College.

==Demographics==

Sunshine is a highly multicultural suburb. In the post-WWII period, many immigrants from all over continental Europe settled in Sunshine. Today Sunshine still has significant populations from Italy, Greece, the former Yugoslavia, and Poland. It is also the main centre for Melbourne&#x27;s Maltese community: indeed, the only branch of Malta&#x27;s Bank of Valletta in the whole of Oceania is situated on Watt Street, Sunshine.

From the late 1970s, many Vietnamese refugees settled in Sunshine and surrounding areas. The Vietnamese have opened small businesses such as groceries and restaurants throughout the Sunshine town centre. More recently, immigrants moving to Sunshine have come from Sudan, Burma and India.

In 2016, Sunshine had a population of 9,768. The most common ancestries given in the 2016 census were: Australian 11.4%, English 12.5%, Vietnamese 12.9%, Chinese 5.9% and Irish 5.0%. For country of birth, 42% of people were born in Australia while the other most common countries of birth were Vietnam with 12.6%, India 5.7%, Burma 4.0%, Philippines 2.0%, and Nepal 2.0%.

==Transport==

Sunshine railway station was completely redeveloped as part of the Regional Rail Link. Works began in 2012 and were complete by mid-2014. It is both a suburban Metro station and an interchange for V/Line (regional) passenger services. Classed as a Premium station, it is in the PTV zones 1+2 overlap.

Sunshine station is one of Victoria&#x27;s most important regional rail hubs: all three of the main western region V/Line lines (Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong) meet at Sunshine. Geelong services have stopped at Sunshine since the opening of the Regional Rail Link in 2015. The Sydney to Melbourne XPT passes through Sunshine, as it uses the Albion–Jacana railway line, but it does not stop there.

Sunshine also has one of Melbourne&#x27;s major suburban bus interchanges, which was upgraded as part of the Regional Rail Link works in 2014. This is situated directly adjacent to the Sunshine Railway Station.

In a 2018 study Sunshine was named one of the 20 most walkable suburbs in Melbourne&#x27;s middle suburbia.

Cyclists in Sunshine are represented by BrimBUG, the Brimbank Bicycle User Group.

<doc id="615769" wikidata="Q189686" url="?curid=615769" title="Patrick Kluivert">
<text>Patrick Stephan Kluivert (; born 1 July 1976) is a Dutch football coach and former player who is currently serving as the head coach of the Indonesia national team. As a player, he played as a striker, most notably for Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands national team. He is considered one of the best Dutch strikers of all time.

He was part of Ajax&#x27;s Golden Generation of the 1990s, scoring the winner in the 1995 UEFA Champions League Final at the age of 18. He spent six years with Spanish club Barcelona, where he scored 124 goals from 249 appearances. He formed a successful partnership with Rivaldo, and won the Spanish La Liga championship of 1999. 

Kluivert played for the Netherlands national team from 1994 to 2004. With 40 goals in 79 appearances, he is the fourth highest goalscorer for the Oranje. He played in three European Championships and the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and was joint top scorer at Euro 2000, where he scored five goals. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by Pelé as part of FIFA&#x27;s centenary observances.

Kluivert began his coaching career as an assistant at AZ and NEC, as well as in Australia with the Brisbane Roar, before managing Jong Twente to a national title in the Dutch reserves league. He was an assistant to Louis van Gaal with the Dutch team that finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. In 2015, he took over as head coach of the Curaçao national team for the country&#x27;s 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying and the 2017 Caribbean Cup qualifying campaigns. He then served as a sporting director for Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona&#x27;s academy, as well as coaching the Ajax A1 (under-19) team and assisting Clarence Seedorf for the Cameroon national team.

==Early life==
Kluivert was born on 1 July 1976 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, Kenneth Kluivert, was a professional football player from Suriname, and his mother was born in Curaçao. Kluivert learned to play football on the street. After a year at football club Schellingwoude, he joined the Ajax Youth Academy at the age of seven.

He played several different positions as a youth, including defender. He was strong in technique, football intelligence, and speed, but was considered too impulsive. Kluivert played for the Dutch national teams under-15, under-16 and under-17.

==Club career==

===Ajax===
Kluivert was part of Ajax&#x27;s Golden Generation of the 1990s. He made his debut in the senior team of Ajax on 21 August 1994 at the age of 18 in the Dutch Supercup win against the old arch rival Feyenoord, in which he scored his first goal. He went on to top score for Ajax in the 1994–95 Eredivisie with 18 goals in 25 appearances, as Louis van Gaal&#x27;s team won the Dutch championship without losing a match. 

The 1994–95 season also saw Kluivert make his mark – along with a host of youngsters from the Ajax youth academy, including Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van der Sar – on the European stage with a triumph in the UEFA Champions League. Kluivert came off the bench to score an 85th-minute winner in the 1995 Champions League Final against AC Milan in Vienna, Austria. He was the youngest player to score in a Champions League final, being only 18 years, 10 months and 23 days.

He was again the top scorer for Ajax in 1995–96, with 15 goals in 28 appearances, as the club won five trophies, including the Eredivisie. He scored the winning goal in extra time of the season opening Dutch Supercup against Feyenoord, and also scored the team&#x27;s away goal in the 5–1 aggregate win over Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Super Cup.

On 28 November 1995, Kluivert was the only Ajax player to miss his kick in the 4–3 penalty shootout win over Grêmio in Tokyo that saw &quot;de Godenzonen&quot; win the Intercontinental Cup. Kluivert was also in excellent form during Ajax&#x27;s defence of their Champions League trophy, scoring in away wins at Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, but a knee injury prevented him from participating for the full 90 minutes in the team&#x27;s loss to Juventus in the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final.

At the end of an injury hit 1996–97 season, in which he made only 17 league appearances, Kluivert joined AC Milan on a Bosman transfer, after rejecting Ajax&#x27;s offer of a new contract. He ended his spell in Amsterdam with 39 goals in 70 Eredivisie matches.

===AC Milan===
Kluivert&#x27;s career at Milan started well, with the striker scoring a sensational goal against Juventus in the Trofeo Luigi Berlusconi. However, he spent only one season at the San Siro, scoring six times in 27 Serie A matches, as the Rossoneri finished in tenth place.

===Barcelona===
On 28 August 1998, an hour before the transfer deadline, Kluivert signed a four-year contract with Barcelona for a fee of £8.75 million. Kluivert was reunited with Louis van Gaal, a mentor from his days at Ajax. Kluivert scored 16 league goals and formed a successful partnership with Rivaldo, which enabled Barça to defend the Spanish La Liga in 1998–99. The following season was also a successful one for Kluivert. Although Barcelona failed to win a third consecutive league title, Kluivert finished the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 15 league goals. Kluivert went on to be the top scorer twice more in his next four seasons at Camp Nou, but the team endured a period of five years without a major trophy after their title success in 1999.

In the summer of 2004, Kluivert was one of four Dutch players released by Barcelona. He ended his career at Barça with 124 goals from 249 appearances.

===Newcastle United===
Kluivert joined Newcastle United on a free transfer in July 2004. He stated that his reasons for joining Newcastle was due to the overwhelming reaction he received whilst playing for Barcelona against Newcastle during a pre season friendly, as well as teaming up with Newcastle&#x27;s star players, such as Alan Shearer. Kluivert scored some classy and crucial goals at home and away from St James&#x27; Park, namely in winning strikes against both Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup, with both games ending 1–0 to Newcastle. He also scored away against Olympiakos in a 3–1 win in the first leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup. Kluivert eventually scored five goals in all in that season&#x27;s competition. Altogether, he scored 13 goals in his debut season, being Newcastle&#x27;s overall second highest goal scorer for the 2004–05 season. Despite these feats, Kluivert was released by Newcastle in the summer of 2005.

===Valencia===
Kluivert decided to return to Spain to play at the Mestalla for Valencia. During the 2005–06 season, Valencia finished third in La Liga, thus qualifying for the Champions League after a one-season absence. Kluivert played for a total of 202 minutes, as he spent most of the season injured.

===PSV===
Despite widespread rumours that Kluivert was to return home to Johan Cruyff Arena, Kluivert&#x27;s return to the Eredivisie was to be with PSV, with whom he signed a one-year deal in 2006. Just as with his debut for Ajax, Kluivert made his PSV debut against Feyenoord in a 2–1 win, coming on as a substitute. After that, he had two injuries during the first half of the season, which limited his playing time. In a game against Ajax at the Philips Stadion, Kluivert refused to celebrate after scoring a goal against his former club. He was eventually released in July 2007.

===Lille===
On 25 July 2007, Kluivert joined French side Lille.

==International career==
Kluivert made his full international debut on 16 November 1994 in a European qualifier against the Czech Republic, replacing Youri Mulder after 13 minutes of a 0–0 draw in Rotterdam. In his second match, on 29 March 1995, he replaced Ronald de Boer after 77 minutes, and seven minutes later scored his first international goal to wrap up a 4–0 home qualifying win over Malta.

In December 1995, Kluivert scored both goals in the Netherlands&#x27; 2–0 UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying play-off win over the Republic of Ireland at Anfield, to qualify the Oranje for UEFA Euro 1996. Kluivert missed most of the tournament with a knee injury, but he scored against the host nation England, enabling the Netherlands to qualify for the knock-out round over Scotland on goals scored. There, they lost in a penalty shootout to France after a 0–0 draw.

At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Kluivert was sent off against Belgium by referee Pierluigi Collina, after elbowing Lorenzo Staelens. He made amends when selected to play against Argentina in the quarter-finals of the same tournament, where he scored the opening goal. In the next round, he scored a late equalising goal from a header to draw his team level with Brazil in the semi-final, although the Netherlands went on to lose the penalty shootout.

At UEFA Euro 2000 held in the Netherlands and Belgium, Kluivert scored a hat-trick in the 6–1 quarter-final demolition of Yugoslavia; he was originally credited with four goals, but the third was later re-attributed as an own goal by Yugoslavia&#x27;s Dejan Govedarica, after Kluivert admitted not getting a touch on Paul Bosvelt&#x27;s cross. Had all four goals stood, Kluivert would have been the first player to score four times in a European Championship match. The Dutch were eliminated in the semi-finals by Italy on penalties; he missed one of their two spot-kicks in normal time, but did score in the penalty shoot-out. With five goals in as many games, he claimed the Golden Boot jointly with Savo Milošević.

Kluivert would once again enter UEFA Euro 2004 wearing the famous #9 jersey for his country, with the Dutch reaching the semi-finals of the tournament.

As well as from being left out of the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad by coach Marco van Basten, Kluivert was not called up to play in any of the qualifying games leading up to the World Cup either. This was due to the fact that he suffered persistent injuries, which prevented him from playing for his club during the 2005-06 season. Kluivert was the all-time leading goalscorer for the Dutch national team with 40 goals, until he was surpassed by Robin van Persie in 2013.

==Style of play==
Although tall in stature, Kluivert possessed quick feet and an impressive first touch. Similar to Brazilian footballer Ronaldo, he often used several feints, namely the Cruyff turn, to great effect to go past defenders, due to his pace, strong technical skills, close control and football intelligence. Kluivert also utilised his height, power and strong physique to dominate aerial balls, and was considered to possess one of the best headers in the then-contemporary game. A versatile player, with an eye for goal, he also possessed good vision, and was capable of playing in several other positions across the pitch. Despite his ability, he drew criticism for his character and attitude throughout his career.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
On 29 April 2008, Dutch media reported that Kluivert would take part in the coaching course of the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) to become a professional football coach. The KNVB requires that all coaching badge candidates complete this sort of apprenticeship.

On 18 July 2008, it was reported on the football website &quot;Goal&quot; that Kluivert would be spending the 2008–09 season as a member of the backroom coaching staff of Eredivisie club AZ. Later on, in an interview on &quot;Soccer AM&quot;, Kluivert revealed his role involved coaching the strikers at AZ.

In January 2010, Kluivert took a position as an assistant coach for Australian A-League side Brisbane Roar under head coach Ange Postecoglou.

On 19 May 2010, Kluivert told journalists he ruled out a comeback as a football player. From August 2010 onwards, he was an assistant coach for NEC, coaching the strikers. In the 2011–12 season, he moved on and took charge of the Twente youth and reserve team, coaching Jong Twente to a national title in the Beloften Eredivisie.

In August 2012, Kluivert joined the Netherlands national team coaching staff to work under head coach Louis van Gaal. Kluivert&#x27;s time with the Netherlands culminated with a third-place finish in the 2014 FIFA World Cup campaign.

===Curaçao===
On 5 March 2015, it was announced that Kluivert would take over as manager of the Curaçao national football team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. Curaçao progressed through the first two qualifying rounds, defeating Montserrat and Cuba. On 8 September 2015, Curaçao were eliminated in the 2018 FIFA World Cup third qualifying round by El Salvador, losing 2–0 on aggregate score. Having helped the country to their best performance yet in World Cup qualifying, Kluivert announced his resignation as head coach on 10 September 2015. While pursuing other ventures, he remains a close advisor to the Curaçao Football Federation.

On 24 February 2016, Kluivert announced his decision to remain head coach of Curaçao ahead of the teams&#x27; Caribbean Cup qualifying matches against the Dominican Republic and Barbados. On 2 May 2016, it was announced that Kluivert would take over as head coach of the Ajax A1 (under-19) selection ahead of the 2016–17 season, where he would coach his son Justin Kluivert, with the team having secured placement in the UEFA Youth League the previous year.

Following his announcement to join Ajax, Kluivert remained head coach of Curaçao for round two of the Caribbean Cup qualifiers, where they faced Guyana and the U.S. Virgin Islands in group three. Curaçao won both their matches at home, defeating Guyana 5–2 and the U.S. Virgin Islands 7–0 in his final match in charge. On 14 July 2016, it was announced that Kluivert would no longer coach the under-19 team of Ajax, but that he would instead take over the position as director of football for French club Paris Saint-Germain. He expressed that his intention was to stay with Ajax, but that he could not refuse the offer made by PSG.

His efforts for the national team of Curaçao did not go without merit, as the team secured qualification for both the 2017 Caribbean Cup and the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where they would compete for the first time in forty years under the guidance of Remko Bicentini and Kluivert.

===Assistant and interim duties===
In August 2018, Kluivert became Seedorf&#x27;s assistant at the Cameroon national football team; they were both relieved of their duties in July 2019.

Kluivert became the academy director of Barcelona only days after leaving Cameroon. However, the club announced in March 2021 that his contract would be allowed to expire in June.

In May 2021, Kluivert returned to the Curaçao national team on an interim basis, while compatriot Guus Hiddink recovered from COVID-19. In July, the team withdrew from the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, due to an outbreak of the same virus.

===Adana Demirspor===
On 30 June 2023, Turkish club Adana Demirspor announced the appointment of Kluivert as their new manager by signing a two-year contract. On 4 December 2023, he parted ways with Adana Demirspor by mutual agreement.

===Indonesia===
On 12 January 2025, Football Association of Indonesia officially appointed Kluivert as the new coach of the Indonesia national team on a two-year contract with the option of extension.

==Personal life==

Kluivert is the second son of former football player Kenneth Kluivert, who played for SV Robinhood in the SVB Hoofdklasse and for the Suriname national team. His mother Lidwina Kluivert, was born in Willemstad, Curaçao, in the former Netherlands Antilles, to a Surinamese father and Curaçaoan mother. Lidwina died on 27 February 2023 due to long-term health issues. His parents were married in Paramaribo, and both his elder siblings were born in Suriname, before the family emigrated to the Netherlands in 1970.

On 9 September 1995, Kluivert, then 19 years old and still playing for Ajax, was the driver in a car accident in Amsterdam, where a 56-year-old man was killed and a passenger was seriously injured in a collision. Kluivert collided with a Ford Orion saloon while driving an uninsured BMW M3 sports car he had borrowed from a friend at a speed of approximately 104 km/h (64 mph) while in a 50 km/h (31 mph) residential zone. Though he denied he was guilty for causing death by dangerous driving, he was found guilty in court and sentenced to 240 hours of community service. It was later revealed that the man, 56-year-old Martin Putnam, who worked as a theatre director, was also an Ajax supporter. The conviction meant that Kluivert needed special documentation to enter the United States when Barcelona played pre-season matches there in 2003.

He has four children—Quincy, Justin, Ruben and Shane. Justin, like his father, came through the Ajax youth setup, formerly played for Valencia and was capped for the Netherlands; as of August 2023 he plays for Bournemouth. Ruben made his debut for Utrecht in 2022 and now plays for Casa Pia AC.

<doc id="615782" wikidata="Q15802" url="?curid=615782" title="Daniel Passarella">
<text>Daniel Alberto Passarella (born 25 May 1953) is an Argentine former footballer and manager, who is considered one of the greatest defenders of all time. As a player for Argentina, he was part of two FIFA World Cup-winning teams; he captained his nation to victory at the 1978 World Cup which Argentina hosted, and was also part of the winning squad in 1986.

Although playing as a centre-back, Passarella was also a proficient goalscorer; at one point, he was football&#x27;s highest-scoring defender, with 134 goals in 451 matches, a record which was subsequently broken by Dutch player Ronald Koeman. In 2004, Passarella was named one of the 125 greatest living footballers by Pelé at a FIFA awards ceremony. In 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; placed him at 36th in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history, recalling that he &quot;tackled with the ferocity of the wild bull of the Pampas&quot;. In 2017, he was named as the 56th best player by &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; in their list of the 100 all-time greatest footballers. As a manager, he coached the Argentina and Uruguay national teams, among several club sides.

After his playing and coaching career, Passarella also served as the president of River Plate for four years, after winning the elections in December 2009.

== Club career ==
Passarella was born in Chacabuco, Buenos Aires. He started his career at Sarmiento of Junín, Buenos Aires, in 1971. He played there until 1973, when he joined River Plate. Playing for &quot;Los Millonarios&quot;, he was constantly starting to be called up to the Argentina national team.

After his good performances at the 1982 World Cup, he joined Serie A side Fiorentina in the summer of 1982. At the Italian club, he scored 11 goals during the 1985–86 season, a record for a defender at the time, although the goal tally was surpassed by Marco Materazzi in the 2000–01 season.

In 1986, he joined Internazionale, where he ended his Italian playing career in 1988. After his successful spell in the Serie A, he returned to River Plate, where he played until his retirement.

He was called &quot;El Gran Capitán&quot; (&#x27;the Great Captain&#x27;, the nickname of the Argentinian independence hero, José de San Martín),&quot;El Kaiser&quot; (an allusion to German defender Franz Beckenbauer) or &quot;El Caudillo&quot; (&#x27;the Chief&#x27;) because of his leadership ability, his passion, and his organisational prowess on the field. He was a defender who often joined the attack, and helped generate and finish offensive plays. He was the all-time highest-scoring defender, with 134 goals in 451 matches, a record that was later broken by Dutch player Ronald Koeman.

His aerial game was effective both defensively and in attack. Despite his average height of 1.73 m, he frequently scored headers. He was also a noted free-kick and penalty specialist. Furthermore, he was known for using elbows against rivals whilst managing to avoid the referee&#x27;s gaze.

== International career ==
As one of the pillars of the Argentina national football team, he would captain the team during the 1978 World Cup held in Argentina. He was the first Argentine player to hold the World Cup, as it was handed to him first when Argentina won the final. During the qualifying rounds of the 1986 World Cup, Passarella contributed to the goal which ensured Argentina&#x27;s qualification in the final minutes of their match against Peru by allowing teammate Ricardo Gareca to score.

A bout of enterocolitis caused him to miss the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. He was replaced in the first team by defender José Luis Brown and failed to regain his place after recovering from illness. Passarella had a fractious relationship with captain Diego Maradona and coach Carlos Bilardo during the tournament. He later claimed Bilardo and Maradona made certain that he was sidelined; although he is the first and so far only player to feature in two Argentina World Cupwinning squads, he did not play any of the matches in 1986, not even as a substitute.

== Coaching career ==

After the end of his playing career, he returned to River Plate as a manager and guided them to three national championships, in 1989–90, 1991 and 1993. Thereafter, Passarella was appointed as the coach of the Argentina national team in 1994, replacing Alfio Basile. He was in charge of the team during the 1998 World Cup qualification campaign and later the competition itself, which was held in France. As the Argentina team head, Passarella had appointed a close friend and a fellow 1978 world champion, Américo Gallego, as his assistant coach. He banned long hair, earrings and homosexuals in the national team, leading to disputes with several players. Fernando Redondo and Claudio Caniggia eventually refused to play for Passarella and were excluded from his squad.

Argentina&#x27;s performances never reached the expected heights during the 1998 World Cup; the team was eliminated in the quarter-final after a last minute 2–1 defeat to the Netherlands. After the elimination, Passarella left the post and was replaced by compatriot Marcelo Bielsa. Subsequently, Passarella became the manager of the Uruguay national team, the first foreigner to take the job of Uruguay team, but he left the post during the 2002 World Cup qualification process. Afterwards, Passarella had a brief and unsuccessful stint as the coach of Italian side Parma in 2001, where, despite success in the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia, he was ultimately sacked after losing all of his five matches in the league, with the club sitting in the relegation zone.

In 2003, he won the Mexican league title with Monterrey. In March 2004, he was named by Pelé as one of the 125 greatest living footballers. He was then hired as coach of Corinthians in Brazil, but was fired after a few months after a spell of bad results.

On 9 January 2006, he was appointed River Plate coach again after 12 years to occupy the vacancy left by Reinaldo Merlo&#x27;s sudden departure. On 15 November 2007, he resigned as coach after River was beaten by penalties by Arsenal de Sarandí in the semi-final of the 2007 Copa Sudamericana.

In the summer of 2018, after publicly expressing interest in returning he was widely seen as the frontrunner to become the new manager of Monterrey for a second stint after the departure of Antonio Mohamed but the club ultimately decided to appoint Diego Alonso.

== Administrative career ==
Passarella was elected as president of River Plate in December 2009. The club was in poor financial shape when Passarella took charge. River Plate were relegated for the first time in the club&#x27;s 110-year history in 2011. Passarella was alleged to have engaged in fraud during his presidency.

<doc id="615785" wikidata="Q220700" url="?curid=615785" title="Omar Sívori">
<text>Enrique Omar Sívori (, ; 2 October 1935 – 17 February 2005) was an Argentine-Italian football player and manager who played as a forward. At club level, he is known for his successful time with Italian side Juventus during the late 1950s and early 1960s, where he won three Serie A titles among other trophies; he also played for River Plate in Argentina and Napoli in Italy.

He made his international debut for Argentina, winning the 1957 South American Championship. Later in his career, he represented Italy and took part in some of the 1962 World Cup. After his retirement as player, he coached several teams in Argentina.

Regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and as one of the greatest football players of all time, Sívori was known for his outstanding skill, speed, goalscoring ability, technique, creativity, and his footballing talent was widely acclaimed. He won the &quot;South American Championship Best Player&quot; award in 1957, and the coveted European Footballer of the Year award in 1961. Sivori scored 432 goals in his career, including friendlies.

==Club career==

===River Plate===
Sívori was born in San Nicolás de los Arroyos, a town which falls within the Buenos Aires Province, in an Italian Argentine family. His paternal grandfather, Giulio Sivori, was an immigrant from Cavi di Lavagna, a hamlet in the province of Genoa, while his mother Carolina was of Abruzzese descent. As a youngster Sívori became heavily interested in the game of football and by the time he reached his teens he was signed up to a side from the city of Buenos Aires, River Plate. The teenage Sívori was given a chance to break through into a squad which included players like the famed forward Ángel Labruna and Félix Loustau who established themselves in the era of &quot;La Máquina&quot;, one of the foremost formations in football history. He soon earned the nickname &quot;El Cabezón&quot; (bighead) from the fans, due to his hair, outspokenness, confidence, arrogance, and playing style.

River was able to win the Argentine Primera División in 1955, the title was confirmed when River beat local archrival Boca Juniors 2–1 at La Bombonera, in Buenos Aires, with just one game remaining. The same season River won the Copa Río de La Plata by beating Nacional from Uruguay. The following season he had similar success when River won the Argentine league title on the final day of the season; beating Rosario Central 4–0, with Sívori scoring the final goal. Sívori would play his final game for River against the same team on 5 May 1957.
During the 1957–58 season, the 21-year-old Sívori was signed by Italian club Juventus after being spotted by Renato Cesarini. Juventus paid 10 million pesos (the equivalent of £91,000) for the transfer, which was a world-record transfer fee for the time. Sívori&#x27;s move would prove bad for River&#x27;s league fortunes, in the 18 years after 1957 they were unable to win the league in Argentina. However, they were able to complete their&quot; El Monumental&quot; stadium (previously nicknamed &quot;the horseshoe&quot;) by adding a fourth stand bearing his name, with the money from the deal.

===Juventus===
The same season two other prominent Argentines moved to the Italian league: Antonio Valentín Angelillo (Inter) and Humberto Maschio (Bologna). The three had all been part of Argentina&#x27;s defenders that brought home gold from the 1957 South American Championship. With an emphasis on the forward line positions, the team was nicknamed &quot;The Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, a reference to cinema&#x27;s then-celebrated &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;–the team&#x27;s irreverent style of play and lackadaisical attitude to training. The nickname followed the trio after the tournament and their move to Italy. In Italy, the trio were nicknamed &quot;The Trio of Death&quot;, the trio&#x27;s clinical ability in scoring goals.
Prior to the arrival of Sívori and Welshman John Charles, Juventus had been going through somewhat of a slump. However, the duo along with experienced &quot;Juventino&quot; Giampiero Boniperti put together a formidable force and won Serie A during the 1957–58 season. Their good form continued and Sívori won two more &quot;scudetti&quot; (1959–60 and 1960–61) as well as two Coppa Italia titles (1958–59 and 1959–60), and the Coppa delle Alpi (1963). Omar Sívori&#x27;s hard work had paid off and he was named European Footballer of the Year (also known as &quot;Ballon d&#x27;or&quot;) in 1961.

The same year as his personal achievement however, the &quot;Magical Trio&quot; as they were known, had broken up with Boniperti&#x27;s retirement and the following season John Charles moved back to Leeds United. Sívori stayed on with the &quot;Old Lady&quot;, notably scoring the only goal in a 1–0 victory against Real Madrid, making Juventus the first Italian side ever to win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Sívori wore the number 10 shirt and was appointed the team&#x27;s captain in 1963, but did not win any more championships or trophies with Juventus, and left after the 1964–65 season, because of a disagreement with new coach Heriberto Herrera.
With Juventus, Sívori scored 167 goals in 253 appearances in all competitions, making him the club&#x27;s fifth highest goalscorer ever as of 2011. He also holds the record for most Serie A goals in a single league match; during the 9–1 victory against Inter Milan on 10 June 1961 he scored six goals; this record is jointly shared with Silvio Piola of Pro Vercelli.

===Napoli===
In 1965, Sívori signed with Napoli, helping them to a third-place finish in the first season at the club; they also won the Coppa delle Alpi. After two successful seasons at the club, Napoli&#x27;s squad during the 1967–68 season boasted several talents along with Sívori, such as goalkeeper Dino Zoff, and fellow strike partner José Altafini, and were considered one of the favourites to win the league title; the club took A.C. Milan all the way in the battle for the Serie A championship but eventually finished in second place, while Sívori was ruled out for most of the season due to a knee injury and several clashes with manager Bruno Pesaola. Ironically, Sívori&#x27;s last game for Napoli was against his former club Juventus, in which he was given a red card for kicking Erminio Favalli, and was suspended for six matches. Following his ban, Sívori decided to return to Argentina during the 1968–69 season.

==International career==
===Argentina===
At international level, Sívori defended the Argentina national football team eighteen times and registered nine goals. The Argentine side of the time had a formidable attack with Sívori, Oreste Corbatta, Osvaldo Cruz, Humberto Maschio and Antonio Angelillo. The attacking trio of Sívori, Maschio, and Angelillo were nicknamed the &quot;caras sucias&quot;, which literally means &quot;dirty faces&quot; in Spanish; in reference to the film of the same name, and due to way they played the game, like fun, dirty faced, mischievous children.

Sívori defended Argentina to the gold medal 1957 South American Championship in Lima, Peru. Argentina dominated in every game during that year&#x27;s South American Championship; the team&#x27;s wins throughout the competition included an 8–2 victory against the Colombia national football team, and a 3–0 victory against close rivals Brazil.

===Italy===
Sívori moved to Italy in 1957, along with his compatriots Maschio and Angelillo. The Argentine football association banned the attacking trio from playing for Argentina, and eliminated them from the 1958 World Cup. Sívori&#x27;s Italian ancestry enabled him to become an Italian citizen. In April 1961 he made his debut for Italy. Along with several other foreign-born Italian players, Sívori played for Italy at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, where they suffered a first-round elimination. He would earn nine caps and score eight goals while playing for Italy.

==Playing style==
&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has described Sívori&#x27;s playing style as &quot;audacious and brilliant&quot;; a highly talented footballer, he is considered one of Italy&#x27;s and Juventus&#x27;s greatest ever players, as well as one of the best players of his generation. Sívori was a quick, diminutive, highly creative, and technically gifted forward, known for his pace on the ball, who used his acceleration, outstanding dribbling skills, flair, and feints to beat opposing defenders; these included turns, flicks, quick changes of direction, and his innovative trademark move: the nutmeg, also known as &quot;tunnel&quot;, in Italian, which involved him playing the ball between an opponent&#x27;s legs. He was primarily a left footed player, and was an excellent finisher and a prolific goalscorer, who possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the area, and who had the ability to score not only with his left, but also his right foot and, in spite of his short stature, his head; this would sometimes see him receiving kicks to the face. Despite not being particularly strong, due to his slender physique, Sívori was also known for his tenacity and bravery on the pitch, as well as his professionalism as a footballer, although he also drew criticism at times for his volatile character and unsportsman-like behaviour, which often saw him argue with officials, commit aggressive tackles on his opponents, or attempt &quot;to provoke and to humiliate&quot; other players with his skill on the ball.

Although he was an excellent goalscorer, especially while with Juventus, Sívori was also able to use his vision and passing accuracy to create chances for team-mates, working in unison with Charles and Boniperti in the club&#x27;s attacking trident, and was capable of playing both in the centre as a main striker and in a deeper role as a second striker or inside forward on the left side of the pitch. Because of his creative playing style, skill, eye for goal, country of birth, hairstyle, strong mentality, and at times rebellious nature both on and off the field, Sívori is often retroactively compared to another left–footed Argentine player who emerged after him: Diego Maradona, with some parts of the media dubbing him &quot;the Maradona of the Sixties&quot;.

==Managerial career==
Sívori retired from the playing field in 1969. Although he retired to his native Argentina as a wealthy man, his love for the game meant that he decided to take up a further career as a coach; he coached River Plate, Rosario Central, Estudiantes de La Plata, Racing Club and Vélez Sarsfield.

From 1972 until 1974, Sívori took charge of the Argentina national team, and the team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Sívori was the first man to call up Ubaldo Fillol to defend Argentina. Fillol would become one of the most highly regarded keepers in Argentine history. After that he became a full-time scout in South America for Juventus. In 1983, he was the head coach for Toronto Italia in the National Soccer League.

==After retirement==
In March 2004, Sívori was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers and honoured as part of the FIFA 100. The following year in February 2005, Sívori died in his hometown of San Nicolás at the age of 69 due to pancreatic cancer.

==Quotes==
*Giampiero Boniperti: &quot;Playing alongside him was pure fun. Charles was the target man, while Omar used the space to put defenders in trouble. He used to play with socks down around his ankles, without any kind of protection, to show he wasn&#x27;t scared of defenders. He had an incredible winning mentality.&quot;
*John Charles: &quot;With Sivori, it was the classic big man-little man partnership. Sivori had huge skill and it was a joy to play with a player as good as he was.&quot;
*Marcello Lippi: &quot;Whenever we were talking about Juventus, his eyes brightened up.&quot;
*Humberto Maschio: &quot;He was amazing. A first-class dribbler who had speed and the ability to surprise at any moment.&quot;
*Roberto Bettega: &quot;He was like an older brother for me. He was my idol when I was a kid and then we became close friends. He was one of the best players in the history of football.&quot;

<text>Mount Hutt () rises to the west of the Canterbury Plains in the South Island of New Zealand, above the braided upper reaches of the Rakaia River, and 80 kilometres west of Christchurch. Its summit is 2190 metres above sea level.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of the hill&quot; for &quot;Ōpuke&quot;.

==Ski field==
The mountain is home to a commercial alpine ski area offering 3.65 square kilometres of skiable terrain and a vertical of 683 metres. The ski field is owned and operated by NZSki

It caters for a wide range of skier and snowboarder abilities, with two surface/conveyor lifts, a high-speed six seater chairlift, a high-speed eight seater chairlift and a fixed-grip three seater chairlift. The lift infrastructure provides access to a wide range of beginner, intermediate and advanced runs, access to large off-piste areas and several terrain parks. The most advanced runs on the mountain are through the rock formations at the top of the field known as &quot;The Towers&quot;, and the South Face.

The snow season is from June to October. Mount Hutt prides itself on being the first ski field in the Southern Hemisphere to open at the beginning of each season. On 12 August 2010, winds of up to 200 km/h struck the ski area, resulting in its closure along with the access road, and stranding 1200 people on the mountain overnight, where they were accommodated in the ski-field&#x27;s base buildings. The road was reopened the following day.

There is no accommodation on the mountain, but visitors can stay in the nearby town of Methven, a 35-minute drive to the mountain. The larger town of Ashburton is 55 minutes away. The city of Christchurch is one hour 45 minutes drive away.

Mt Hutt is managed by NZSki along with Coronet Peak and The Remarkables in Queenstown. Mount Hutt was named by the Canterbury Association surveyor Joseph Thomas for John Hutt, an early member of the Association.

In 2020, the Zionist Federation of New Zealand lobbied the ski-field to remove a commemorative plaque to one of its founders, Willi Huber, a former member of the Waffen-SS. The Federation also lobbied for the renaming of a ski trail and alpine restaurant that were named after Huber. NZSki have renamed the ski trail and restaurant.

==Fauna==
During the summer months four species of Alpine grasshoppers can be found within the ski field boundary. They include &quot;Sigaus villosus&quot; which can be found along the ridgelines, &quot;Brachaspis nivalis&quot; which lives on the rocky scree, &quot;Sigaus australis&quot; and &quot;Paprides nitidus&quot; which both live in the alpine tussocklands.

Mount Hutt is the type locality for the endemic moth &quot;Orocrambus aethonellus.&quot;

== Climate ==
Mount Hutt in the Koppen-Geiger Classification System, is a Tundra Climate (ET). Mount Hutt features a cold enough temperature for skifields. Below is a climate of Mount Hutt Skifield:

<doc id="615788" wikidata="Q164546" url="?curid=615788" title="Alfredo Di Stéfano">
<text>Alfredo Stéfano Di Stéfano Laulhé (; 4 July 1926 – 7 July 2014) was a professional footballer and coach who played as a forward, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. Nicknamed &quot;Saeta Rubia&quot; (&quot;Blond Arrow&quot;), he is best known for his achievements with Real Madrid, where he was instrumental in the club&#x27;s domination of the European Cup and La Liga during the 1950s and 1960s. Along with Francisco Gento and José María Zárraga, he was one of only three players to play a part in all five European Cup victories, scoring goals in each of the five finals. Di Stéfano played international football mostly for Spain after moving to Madrid, but he also played for Argentina and Colombia.

Di Stéfano began his career at Argentina&#x27;s River Plate aged 17, in 1943. For the 1946 season he was loaned to Club Atlético Huracán, but he returned to River in 1947. Due to a footballers&#x27; strike in Argentina in 1949, Di Stéfano went to play for Millonarios of Bogotá in the Colombian league. He won six league titles during the first 12 years of his career in Argentina and Colombia. Following his signing by Real Madrid he was an integral part of one of the most successful teams of all time. He scored 216 league goals in 282 games for Real (then a club record, since surpassed by Raúl, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema), striking up a successful partnership with Ferenc Puskás. Di Stéfano&#x27;s 49 goals in 58 matches was the all-time highest tally in the European Cup. The record has since been surpassed by several players, including the aforementioned Real Madrid trio. Di Stéfano scored in five consecutive European Cup finals for Real Madrid between 1956 and 1960, including a hat-trick in the last. Perhaps, the highlight of his time with the club was their 7–3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 final at Hampden Park, a game many consider to be the finest exhibition of club football ever witnessed in Europe. He moved to Espanyol in 1964 and played there until retiring at the age of 40.

Di Stéfano was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or for the European Footballer of the Year in 1957 and 1959. He is currently the seventh highest scorer in the history of Spain&#x27;s top division, and Real Madrid&#x27;s fourth highest league goalscorer of all time. He is Madrid&#x27;s leading goalscorer in the history of &quot;El Clásico&quot;, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Spain by the Royal Spanish Football Federation as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. He was voted fourth, behind Pelé, Diego Maradona, and Johan Cruyff, in a vote organized by &quot;France Football&quot; magazine which consulted their former Ballon d&#x27;Or winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players (in September 2009, he said Di Stéfano was the best player &quot;ever&quot;). In 2008 Di Stéfano was honoured by both UEFA and Real Madrid with a special Presidents&#x27; award issued by FIFA at a ceremony in Madrid, where a statue was also unveiled. Then UEFA President Michel Platini called Di Stéfano &quot;a great amongst the greats&quot; while contemporaries Eusébio and Just Fontaine suggested that he was &quot;the most complete footballer in the history of the game&quot;.

==Early life==

Born in Barracas, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Di Stéfano was the son of Alfredo Di Stéfano, a first-generation Italian Argentine (his father Michele emigrated to Argentina from Capri in the 19th century), and Eulalia Laulhé Gilmont, an Argentine woman of French and Irish descent with her relatives being from Swinford, County Mayo.

Di Stéfano&#x27;s father, who was a former defender of River Plate (having prematurely retired in 1912 due to a knee injury), introduced young Alfredo to football. Di Stéfano grew up playing street football, in oratories and in neighbourhood teams such as the Barracas &quot;Unidos y Venceremos&quot;, and the Imán of the Flores district. People already had noticed his talent. But, in 1940 his family moved to the countryside and Di Stéfano started working with his father and playing football with his brother Tulio for Club Social y Deportivo Unión Progresista until 1943, when the family returned to Buenos Aires.

==Club career==

===River Plate===

In 1944 Di Stéfano&#x27;s father wrote a letter of recommendation to River Plate, and the club sent a reply telegram to invite him to an audition with the youth team. Di Stéfano impressed on the trial and joined the second team squad of River Plate, the club his family supported. The next year he became part of the first team which was called La Máquina due to their unprecedented success, consisting of players like Pedernera, Labruna Muñoz, and Loustau. One of the main stars of the team, Moreno, had just left for the Mexican Real Club España and it seemed like a good opportunity for the young Di Stéfano to fight for a place on the first squad.

Di Stéfano, whose idol was Paraguayan Arsenio Erico, the Independiente striker, learned from the big stars, especially Pedernera. His coach and first mentor Carlos Peucelle taught him how to play the ball low and soon he made his first team debut in 1945, at the age of 19: on 15 July of that year he debuted against Huracán in a 2–1 defeat on the twelfth day of the 1945 Argentine championship. This was the only game Di Stéfano played in that year, but at the end of the season he won his first title as River Plate won the championship, four points ahead of Boca Juniors.

===Loaned to Huracán===

During the only match Di Stéfano played in the previous season, the president of Huracán was impressed by his potential; Di Stéfano agreed to join them, as he realised his chances of making the first team for River Plate were limited. Huracán and Argentina legend Herminio Masantonio had just retired and the club needed a replacement forward.

Former Argentine striker and World Cup top scorer Guillermo Stábile, the Huracán and Argentina national team coach at the time, gave Di Stéfano his first real opportunities in the 1946 season. He scored the first two goals of his career in a 3–1 victory against Estudiantes (LP).

He later scored against his former team River Plate, netting the fastest goal in the history of the Argentine championship after about ten seconds of play. He would score 10 goals in 25 appearances for Huracan, teaming up perfectly with Norberto Méndez who would later become the all-time top scorer in Copa América. Huracán tried to sign Di Stéfano permanently at the end of a successful eighth-place season, but could not afford the 90,000 pesos River Plate asked for the transfer.

===Return to River Plate 1947–1949===

Upon his return to River Plate, Di Stéfano became an integral part of La Máquina, taking on the role of the departing Adolfo Pedernera who had signed for Club Atlético Atlanta. Carlos Peucelle initially put Di Stéfano on the flank, a position in which Di Stéfano struggled; in a game against Atlanta of Pedernera, Peucelle decided to use him as a center forward and River eventually won 6–1. Soon, Di Stéfano imposed himself as the center forward and his teammates adapted to his game. He received the nickname of &quot;Saeta Rubia&quot; from journalist Roberto Neuberger. Though he had to leave the team for some time due to compulsory conscription, Di Stéfano contributed significantly to winning the 1947 Argentine Primera División, becoming the top scorer of the league with 27 goals.
The league victory gave River Plate the right to represent Argentina in the Copa Aldao against the champions of Uruguay Nacional Montevideo who featured great player like goalkeeper Anibal Paz and Walter Taibo in a two-nation club competition that tracked origins to 1913 and for many it was considered the precursor to the Copa Libertadores. In November 1947, River beat Nacional 4–3 with Di Stéfano scoring one goal in Montevideo, and four days later Di Stéfano celebrated his first international club trophy with a 3–1 victory in Buenos Aires.

In February 1948, champions River Plate participated in the inaugural South American Championship of Champions in Santiago facing the other South American champions, finishing second behind Vasco da Gama with Di Stéfano scoring four goals in six games. During the Argentine championship of 1948, the Football Association suspended the tournament for a short time due to the protests of players led by Adolfo Pedernera and Alfredo Di Stéfano that resulted in a player&#x27;s strike in a bid to gain professional status and rights. Despite that upheaval Di Stéfano scored 13 goals in 23 games and River Plate finished third. The strike lasted for eight months until 1949 and it eventually meant the departure of the best Argentine footballers to other leagues, in particular Colombia&#x27;s, which was one of the most lucrative in the world at the time.

In one of his last games in Argentina, on 31 July 1949, Di Stéfano played in the role of goalkeeper, replacing the owner Amadeo Carrizo for a few minutes and keeping the clean sheet in a derby won against Boca Juniors.

===Millonarios 1949–1953===
After the Superga air disaster, in May 1949, a friendly match between River Plate and Grande Torino was played and Di Stéfano was promised to the Granata. However the Argentine forward was soon after contacted by Adolfo Pedernera, who had already agreed to terms with the Colombian Bogota-based club Millonarios on 9 August 1949, after another one of his teammates, Néstor Rossi, signed for the Colombian club without River Plate receiving any compensation for the transfer. Di Stéfano signed with the Colombians. Millonarios, who could not afford to pay the transfer fees anyhow, offered him a salary clearly higher than that at River Plate, and the Argentine forward started a new chapter in his career in Colombia, in period called El Dorado. Many international stars like the Hungarians Béla Sárosi, László Szőke, the Argentines René Pontoni, Héctor Rial, Englishman Charlie Mitten from Manchester United for 5,000 pounds a year, Neil Franklin from Stoke City, French-Hungarian Ferenc Nyers, Italian Luigi Di Franco, the Brazilian Heleno de Freitas and others had joined the league after Pedernera first signed.

The Colombian league had turned professional in 1948, beginning the El Dorado period on 25 April 1949. Di Stéfano, Perdenera, and Nestor Rossi who joined Millonarios in the summer, formed part of the famous team called the Ballet Azul that won their first title ever beating Deportivo Cali in the 1949 final, with Di Stéfano scoring 16 goals in 14 games. Di Stéfano scored 23 goals in 29 games the following 1950 season, but Millonarios finished two points behind eventual champions Deportes Caldas. Di Stéfano, who kept himself in excellent condition, excelled during his games and led Millonarios to a second title in 1951, leaving runners-up Boca Juniors de Cali 11 points behind at the final table. Di Stéfano scored 32 goals in 34 games, more than any other player in the league. Millonarios would go on to lose the 1951 Copa Colombia (played in 1952) to Boca Juniors de Cali.

The 1952 league had the same outcome: Milionarios overtook Boca Juniors de Cali, won their third title, and Di Stéfano was once again top scorer with 19 goals. In October 1952, Di Stéfano also led Millonarios to the Copa Colombia final after beating Cúcuta Deportivo by 2–1. The final would be played in May 1953, after Di Stéfano had already gone to Argentina.

In October 1951, the División Mayor del Fútbol Profesional Colombiano agreed to the Pacto de Lima with FIFA, with the requirement that foreign players would return to their countries after October 1954. Di Stéfano scored a total of 267 goals in 292 games for Milionarios, and is considered one of the best footballers in the history of the Colombian League.

===The disputed transfer to Spain===
In March 1952, Real Madrid organized a friendly tournament in the Spanish capital at its newly constructed home ground; River Plate was invited to participate in Real Madrid&#x27;s 50th-anniversary tournament. The tournament was called Bodas de Oro, but once Real Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabeu heard about the new powerhouse in South America, Real Madrid cancelled the invitation to River Plate and invited the Colombians as the South American representative. The Colombians participated in the tournament and won it, after drawing 2–2 with Swedish champions Norrköping and overcoming Los Blancos, who were managed by Uruguayan legend Hector Scarone, by a 4–2 margin with a brace from &quot;Saeta Rubia&quot; in the presence of President Santiago Bernabéu, who arrived to the stadium to observe Adolfo Pedernera. Millonarios would start a global tour and, spearheaded by Di Stéfano, they would beat Hungary and world champions Uruguay.

Soon after Millonarios&#x27; return to Colombia, the Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano&#x27;s rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. In Christmas 1952, Di Stéfano, still contracted with Millonarios, returned briefly to Buenos Aires, where he was even making plans to abandon football and start a business, as the Argentine league was still not professional.

FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953.

Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to the Blancos signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club. This fact contributed greatly to intensifying the rivalry with Barcelona.

===Real Madrid: The first European triumph===
A 27-year-old Di Stéfano arrived at Real Madrid on 22 September 1953, after seven months of inactivity, and made his debut with the white jersey five days later, scoring his first goal for Real Madrid in a 4–2 home win against Racing Santander. On 25 October 1953, Di Stéfano played in his first Clásico against champions Barcelona, just a few hours after the Catalonian team had sold his share on the Argentinian, and Di Stéfano contributed two goals in a 5–0 win. In his first several months in Madrid, the Argentine champion did not adapt to European football, but imposed his own style, playing all around the field with speed and keeping the ball low on the ground. Highlights of his first season included two match-winning performances against city rivals Atlético Madrid, with a hat-trick in a 5–0 away win in November 1953, and scoring the two goals in a 5–0 home comeback in February 1954. The Blancos managed to win the Spanish championship after two decades, with Di Stéfano contributing two hat-tricks in the last two home games of the season, including the decisive 4–0 win against Valencia that secured the title victory. His late goalscoring run made Di Stéfano the top scorer of 1953–54 La Liga with 27 goals in 28 appearances, beating Barcelona&#x27;s László Kubala by three goals.

The following year, Real Madrid acquired Argentine Héctor Rial from the Nacional Montevideo, a signing recommended by Di Stéfano, for the attack of the Merengues. Despite the surprise sacking of manager Enrique Fernández halfway through the season, the club won another league title in 1955 with José Villalonga, leaving Barcelona again in the second place of the table. Di Stéfano scored 25 goals, finishing behind only Juan Arza (28) among the scorers of the Spanish league. On 26 June 1955, &quot;Los Blancos&quot; won their first ever Latin Cup, beating Raymond Kopa&#x27;s Reims in the Paris final 2–0.

The second consecutive Spanish title allowed Real Madrid to be the first Spanish representative in the inaugural European Cup in the 1955–56 season. Di Stéfano made his European Cup debut against Servette in a 2–0 away win. In the league, he was again the top scorer with 24 goals, but despite that, Athletic Bilbao won the tournament ahead of Barça and Real. In the European Cup, the team had their way eliminating the Swiss and later Partizan Belgrade, after a suffering a 3–0 defeat in Yugoslavia. With the guidance of Di Stéfano they had an easy 4–0 victory in Madrid in the first leg, in December 1956. Real Madrid flew to Belgrade and despite the snowstorm that had hit the city in the previous days, the president Bernabéu agreed for the match not to be postponed. Unlike the Spaniards, the Partizan players did not suffer on the terrain, taking the lead and dominating the game. A penalty was awarded to Real Madrid, but Héctor Rial slipped when kicking and missed it. In the final minutes with the Serbians up by 3–0, Di Stéfano helped in defending and Real qualified despite a clear defeat. The Blancos eliminated Milan in the semi-finals 6–4 on aggregate and entered the final in Paris against Raymond Kopa&#x27;s Reims. Real Madrid suffered in the first half, but Di Stéfano carried his teammates in a comeback to win the trophy 4–3. At the end of the year, on 18 December 1956, the first Ballon d&#x27;Or was awarded, and Di Stéfano missed on winning it by just three votes to Stanley Matthews of English club Blackpool.

===Naturalization and the building of an empire===
During the summer of 1956, Real Madrid signed Raymond Kopa from the Stade de Reims. The French forward could not feature in the games due to the limit of foreigners in La Liga and had to wait for the Spanish naturalization of Di Stèfano, who became a Spanish citizen in October 1956.

The season started early with the participation of Real Madrid in the Small World Cup in Caracas, Venezuela as European champions. The Spaniards faced Vasco da Gama, Roma and Porto playing against players like World Cup winner Alcides Ghiggia and Vavá. Real won the trophy with three wins and Di Stéfano finished as top scorer of the tournament with four goals (same as Vavá).

As Real Madrid did not win the title in the previous season, president Santiago Bernabéu, who also served as the vice-president of the competition, came up with the idea that the European Cup winner had the right to register for the next edition to defend the title even if they had failed to win the domestic league. Consequently, Real participated in the 1956–57 season, eliminating Rapid Vienna, Nice, and Manchester United in the semi-finals before beating Fiorentina 2–0 in the final, in Madrid. During the season, Real also asserted itself in the last edition of the Latin Cup, overcoming Benfica 1–0 in the final with a decisive goal by Di Stéfano. At the end of the year, he won the 1957 Ballon d&#x27;Or. From the twenty-third day of the 1956–57 La Liga, Real Madrid started a series of consecutive victorious home results that ended only in 1966, at the twenty-fifth round of the Liga, after 121 matches. The Blancos attack was one of the best in history and boasted Di Stéfano, Héctor Rial, Francisco Gento and Kopa. Real won the league title in 1957 and Di Stéfano was again the top scorer with 31 goals.

In the following season, Real Madrid was further strengthened with the arrival of Uruguayan José Santamaría in defense. Di Stéfano scored 19 goals and won the top scorer award, obtaining the 1957–58 league title at the expense of Atlético Madrid. In the quarter-finals of the European Cup, Real Madrid faced Sevilla, humiliating their opponents in the first leg in Madrid with an 8–0 victory, where Di Stéfano scored four goals. In the return leg in Seville, Di Stéfano was greeted by the insulting choruses of opposing fans and Real were held to a 2–2 draw. In the semi-finals, Di Stèfano contributed to the success against the Hungarian Vasas and the team reached the final against Juan Alberto Schiaffino&#x27;s Milan. Real Madrid won the final with a 3–2 comeback victory, and the Argentine finished the tournament as the top scorer with 10 goals.

The season finished with the loss of the 1958 Generalísimo Cup in the final to Athletic Bilbao, 0–2. As a result, Ferenc Puskás signed with Real Madrid in the summer of 1958 to strengthen the squad and Real Madrid would be blessed with one of the most lethal attacking pairs in the history of football. Nevertheless, Real ended up second in the 1958–59 season behind Barça, with Di Stéfano finishing as the best scorer in the league for the fifth and last time, and the fourth in a row, with 23 goals.

After overcoming rivals Atlético Madrid in three games in the semi-finals, Real Madrid won its fourth consecutive European Cup by defeating Reims (as three years ago), that now included the 1958 FIFA World Cup top-scorer Just Fontaine, by a score of 2–0. During the final, Enrique Mateos, substituting for Puskás (the Hungarian feared retaliation and decided not to depart with the team for the final in Stuttgart), took a penalty instead of Di Stéfano and missed it. At the beginning of the second half, Di Stéfano scored the second goal to seal the victory.

On 16 July 1959, Real Madrid hosted a match against Pelé and his Brazilian club, Santos, during their European tour. It was one of the most anticipated games of the tour, given the reputation that Pelé had started building. Di Stéfano&#x27;s team would beat the Brazilians 5–3. In December, &quot;France Football&quot; awarded Di Stéfano the 1959 Ballon d&#x27;Or, which he won ahead of teammate Raymond Kopa (who had already returned to Stade de Reims in the summer of 1959) and Juventus&#x27;s Welsh star John Charles. Puskás and Gento both finished in the top ten.

During the 1959–60 season, the Madrilenos signed the Brazilian midfielder Didi who was a 1958 World Cup winner, the tournament best player and former teammate of Garrincha and Pelé. Given that the Brazilian&#x27;s style of play was similar to Di Stéfano&#x27;s, Didi often clashed with the Argentine and there were rumours that he asked for his release from the club&#x27;s management in the summer of 1960. But with Didi in the squad, the Blancos won their fifth consecutive European Cup. After eliminating Barcelona in the semi-finals, Real Madrid played in the final at the Hampden Park in Glasgow in front of 135,000 spectators against Eintracht Frankfurt. Di Stéfano and Puskás scored three and four goals, respectively, in a game considered to be among the finest in the history of football. Di Stéfano scored eight goals in the tournament, finishing second in the scorers&#x27; chart won by Puskás. In the 1959–60 league season, Real finished equal with Barcelona on points, but the Catalonians were the ones to be awarded the title on a goal average tie-breaker. Di Stéfano did not win the Pichichi award as Puskás was the league top scorer with 25 goals. Real Madrid lost the Generalísimo Cup final to Atlético Madrid 3–1 at home on 26 June 1960.

===European decline and the first domestic double===
The new season started with the inaugural Intercontinental Cup and the 0–0 draw in the first leg of the final against Peñarol in Montevideo on 4 July. In the return leg, however, Real beat the Uruguayans 5–1 with Di Stéfano scoring one goal on 4 September 1960. On 13 December 1960, Di Stéfano came fourth in the Ballon d&#x27;Or voting, and for the first time in history, Real Madrid were knocked out of the European Cup, losing 3–4 on aggregate against Barcelona after a controversial second leg. Madrid, however, regrouped and easily won La Liga by a great margin over runners-up Atlético Madrid, but lost the final of the Generalísimo Cup again to Rojiblancos, 2–3. Di Stéfano finished the season with 21 goals, being the second-highest scorer in the league behind Puskás who netted 28 goals.

In the 1961–62 season, Di Stéfano won the domestic double for the first time, clinching the Generalísimo Cup 15 years since the last time Real Madrid had won the trophy, after beating Sevilla 2–1 in the final with two goals from Puskás to overturn the initial red and white advantage. Di Stéfano finished 6th in the Ballon d&#x27;Or voting in December. In the 1961–62 European Cup, Real reached the final for the sixth time in seven seasons, after eliminating Juventus and Standard Liège. In the showpiece, Madrid played against defending champions Benfica and though the Spaniards took the lead twice, in the second half of the game the Lusitanians cruised to successfully retaining their title with a thrilling 5–3 victory, courtesy of Eusébio. Real Madrid lost its first European Cup final, and for the first time Di Stéfano failed to score (the three goals were scored by Puskás). Nevertheless, Di Stéfano was among the best scorers of the competition for the second time in his career, with seven goals.

In the autumn of 1962, the Blancos were eliminated in the 1962–63 European Cup preliminary round by Anderlecht. However, with Di Stéfano at the age of 37, Real won the 1962–63 league title over Atlético Madrid, with Puskás finishing as the top scorer once again.

The 1963–64 season was the last for Di Stéfano at Real Madrid. At the beginning of the season, the team had an exhibition tour in Venezuela as they participated in the Small Club World Cup against São Paulo and Porto. Di Stéfano played on the first match on 20 August, but on 24 August the Argentine champion was kidnapped by the National Liberation Armed Forces of Venezuela in the Potomac hotel in Caracas, and was released by them three days later, unharmed. The incident cost the Los Blancos the trophy as without Di Stéfano they could not overcome São Paulo in the final game. The season, however, went on to be quite successful, with the Blancos clinching their fourth consecutive league title and returning to the European Cup final, having defeated AC Milan in the quarter-finals 4–3 on aggregate along the way. In the final, Madrid faced Helenio Herrera&#x27;s Inter Milan. Hours before the final, Di Stéfano explicitly criticized the tactics designed by Real Madrid head coach Miguel Muñoz against Italian defender Giacinto Facchetti. The relationship between Di Stéfano and Muñoz, who had the support of President Bernabéu, had been problematic for over a year and reached its climax in the final, which Inter won 3–1, a match in which both came to accuse each other of the defeat. The final on 27 May 1964 was his last match with Madrid, and in doing so at the age of 37 years, 10 months and 23 days, he became the oldest outfield player in the club&#x27;s history, until that record was surpassed in the following year by Puskás and then by Luka Modrić in 2023; currently the fifth oldest overall, also behind goalkeepers Francisco Buyo and Jerzy Dudek.

===Real Madrid career in numbers===
Di Stéfano played for Real Madrid for eleven years, winning eight Spanish championships, one Spanish Cup, two Latin Cups, five consecutive Champions Cups (scoring in all the finals he won), one Intercontinental Cup, several individual titles, including league top scorer five times. He scored 418 goals in 510 games, of which 308 goals in 396 official matches (49 goals in 59 matches in the Champions Cup), becoming the best scorer in the history of the club, until that record was surpassed several decades later first by Raúl and then by Cristiano Ronaldo (the current record goalscorer) and Karim Benzema. Di Stéfano also scored a then-record 22 La Liga hat-tricks, the last of which came against Real Murcia on 15 March 1964, becoming, at the age of 37 years and 255 days, the oldest player to achieve that feat not only in La Liga, but in Europe&#x27;s top five leagues, a record that he held for 45 years until it was broken by Joaquín in 2019.

===Espanyol===
After the Champions Cup final loss in 1964 against Inter Milan, president Santiago Bernabéu offered Di Stéfano a place on the Real Madrid coaching staff instead of renewing the player&#x27;s contract. Di Stéfano refused Bernabéu&#x27;s proposal and left the club instead. The news about his freedom spread much ink in the local and national press as several clubs came knocking on his door, such as Espanyol, Betis, Celtic, and AC Milan. In late July, Di Stéfano even went to Milan accompanied by Luis Carniglia to meet the club&#x27;s leaders and issue a counteroffer to Espanyol&#x27;s proposal, but the Italians were not willing to undertake his signing at any price and they already had the three foreign players allowed per squad. In early August, Celtic made a £20,000 ($56,000) offer at the last minute, but Di Stéfano sent a telegram to the Scots declining the proposal.

The Argentine veteran scored nine goals in all competitions in his first season with Espanyol, putting an end to a streak of 15 consecutive seasons in which he scored in double figures (18 total). In his final season with Espanyol, he scored five goals in all competitions, including a goal against his former club Barcelona on 12 February 1966, and then, eight days later, his last-ever La Liga goal, an equalizer against RCD Mallorca to seal a 1–1 draw, which proved to be crucial in Espanyol&#x27;s survival as they finished just one point ahead of Mallorca, who was relegated. In doing so at the age of 39 years and 226 days, he became the second oldest scorer in the competition&#x27;s history, only behind César Rodríguez in 1960 (39 years and 274 days). He played his last league match against Atlético Madrid on 3 April, at the age of 39 years and 270 days, currently the seventh oldest player to play in La Liga.

Di Stéfano scored his last career goal on 23 April, a 79th-minute winner against Real Betis in the first leg of the 1965–66 Copa del Rey round of 16, but Espanyol then lost the second leg on 30 April by 0–4 in what was his last game as a professional. After 14 goals in 60 matches with Espanyol, he retired as a player in 1966, just a few months shy of his 40th birthday, helping his team avoid relegation in both seasons. Despite what was previously stated, Bernabéu decided to honour Di Stéfano for his services by giving him a farewell match at the Bernabéu on 7 June 1967 against Celtic, who won 0–1 with a goal from Bobby Lennox. In the 13th minute, Di Stéfano took off the captain&#x27;s armband and gave it to Ramón Grosso, a player who inherited his number in the team, amidst the applause of the entire Stadium and after which he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit, the highest distinction for sport in Spain.

==International career==
Di Stéfano played with three different national teams during his career, scoring six goals in six appearances for Argentina, and 23 in 31 appearances for Spain. However, he never played in the World Cup. Di Stéfano also played four times for Colombia, during the Dimayor period of Colombian football. The team at the time was not recognised by FIFA as the league had broken transfer rules in signing players while still under contract.

===Argentina===

Di Stéfano made his international debut on 4 December 1947, in a match against Bolivia at the Estadio George Capwell in Ecuador, during the 1947 South American Championship. He scored his first international goal in that same match, helping Argentina to a 7–0 win. Di Stéfano scored five more goals during the championship – including his first hat-trick against Colombia – as Argentina successfully defended the title they had won the previous year on home soil.

Di Stéfano&#x27;s six games during that tournament would prove to be his only appearances for Argentina. Player strikes, and a dispute with the Brazilian Football Confederation, forced Argentina to withdraw from qualifying for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, as well as the 1949 and 1953 South American Championships. By the time qualifying began for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, FIFA had banned Di Stéfano from making any further appearances for Argentina, on account of his appearances for the Colombia XI two years earlier – though Argentina once again pulled out of qualifying.

===Colombia (not-FIFA sanctioned)===
In 1949 the Argentinian league went on strike, and Di Stéfano moved to Millonarios in Colombia. At the same time the División Mayor del Fútbol Profesional Colombiano league had split from the Colombian football federation resulting in an international ban for the clubs and players alike. Ignoring the edict, the breakaway league organised a series of friendly matches were organised as a combined XI of the Colombian league. Di Stéfano made four appearances for the Colombian XI team in non-FIFA sanctioned internationals in 1951.

===Spain===

Di Stéfano was widely loved in Spain, and having been banned from playing for Argentina, it made sense for Di Stéfano to play for Spain. FIFA initially refused to sanction this, but after Di Stéfano acquired Spanish citizenship in 1956, and amid pressure from the Spanish FA, the decision was eventually reversed. Di Stéfano consequently made his debut for Spain on 30 January 1957 in a friendly against the Netherlands in Madrid, scoring a hat-trick in a 5–1 win to become one of a number of players born outside Spain to have appeared for their national team.
The Spanish team, with a forward line also boasting Barcelona and Real Madrid stars Laszlo Kubala, Luis Suárez and Francisco Gento, were favourites to qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, having been drawn into a qualification group with Scotland and minnows Switzerland. However, Spain began their campaign with a 2–2 draw against the Swiss and then lost to Scotland at Hampden Park 4–2. Spain won both of the reverse fixtures 4–1, but the damage had already been done: Scotland beat Switzerland in their final match and qualified at Spain&#x27;s expense. Di Stéfano, who had played in all four games and scored two goals, missed out yet again.

In 1961, at the age of 35, Di Stéfano finally qualified for a World Cup, helping Spain qualify for the 1962 edition in Chile. A muscular injury just before the competition prevented him from playing in the finals, but Di Stéfano travelled with the squad anyway, picking the number 6 jersey as his preferred number 9 was taken by Gento. Spain boasted the likes of José Santamaría and Ferenc Puskás – both also naturalised citizens, and who had, coincidentally, represented their respective home countries in the 1954 tournament – but with Di Stéfano sidelined, they failed to make it out of the group stage, losing to Didi&#x27;s Brazil in their final game and finishing at the bottom of their group. Di Stéfano retired from international football after the tournament.

==Managerial career==

After retirement, Di Stéfano moved into coaching. He guided Argentine club Boca Juniors to win two titles, the 1969 Nacional when the team won the Nacional championship. and the 1969 Copa Argentina.

After his successful run in Argentina, in Di Stéfano returned to Spain for the 1970-71 season winning La Liga and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Valencia. He also managed Sporting in the 1974–75 season.

In 1981 Di Stefano was hired as coach of River Plate, the club where he had debuted as player. With Mario Kempes as the star player of the team, Di Stéfano led River Plate to win the 1981 Nacional championship.

Di Stéfano was also coach of Real Madrid between 1982 and 1984. In the 1982–83 season, they finished second in La Liga and were defeated in the finals of the 1982 Supercopa de España, Copa de la Liga, and Copa del Rey. Madrid also reached the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final that season, but were also beaten by Aberdeen, managed by Alex Ferguson. The team also finished second in the La Liga of next season again. He also returned to Valencia in 1986 to guide them back to La Liga by winning the Segunda Division after their relegation the season prior before his arrival.

==After retirement==

Di Stéfano resided in Spain until his death in 2014. On 5 November 2000, he was named Honorary President of Real Madrid.

On 24 December 2005, 79-year-old Di Stéfano suffered a heart attack.

On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium was inaugurated at the &quot;City of Real Madrid&quot;, where Real Madrid usually train. Its inaugural match was a friendly between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the European Cup final won by Real Madrid in 1956. Real Madrid won 6–1 with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado.

==Style of play==
Regarded as a very strong player, Di Stéfano was a powerful, quick, skillful, and prolific goalscorer, with great stamina, tactical versatility, creativity, and vision, who could play almost anywhere on the pitch. He is arguably one of the greatest dribblers ever to set foot on a pitch. He was highly proficient in using feints to get past defenders and create chances, and volleys as well as bicycle kicks to score dynamic goals. &quot;A complete footballer. He can attack and defend, he creates and scores,&quot;.

==Death==

Following another heart attack on 5 July 2014, the 88-year-old Di Stéfano was moved to intensive care in the Gregorio Marañón hospital in Madrid, where he died on 7 July 2014.

On 8 July, Di Stéfano&#x27;s coffin was placed on public display at the Bernabéu Stadium. Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez and captain Iker Casillas were amongst those in attendance. Following his death Di Stéfano received tributes from many famous football personalities including Alex Ferguson, Pelé, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Maradona, and Bobby Charlton.
During the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the Netherlands on 9 July, Di Stéfano was honoured with one minute of silence, while the Argentine team also wore black ribbons in a matter of respect.

River Plate and Millonarios organized a friendly match in homage of their former player. The match was played on 16 July 2014, at Millonarios&#x27; Estadio El Campín.

In September 2017, a street near Real Madrid&#x27;s training complex was named after Di Stéfano for the 64th anniversary of his debut.

==Personal life==
Di Stéfano married Sara Freites in 1950; they had six children. Sara died in 2005. In 2013, Di Stéfano&#x27;s children won custody of him and his assets in order to prevent his planned wedding to Gina González, his Costa Rican secretary who was 50 years younger than him.

In 1965, Di Stefano was made the godfather of Quique Sánchez Flores, the son of Di Stefano&#x27;s then Real Madrid teammate Isidro Sánchez.

<text>Javier Adelmar Zanetti (, ; born 10 August 1973) is an Argentine former professional footballer. Regarded as one of the best right-backs of all time, Zanetti is well known for having dedicated almost his entire career at Inter Milan, having a key role in the historic treble-winning 2009–10 season. Zanetti was known for his versatility as well as his adeptness on both the left and right wing, having played mostly as a full-back or wing-back on both flanks, but also spending considerable time as a midfielder. He is currently the vice-president of Inter Milan.

Zanetti started his career in Argentina, first with Talleres, and then Banfield. From 1995 to 2014 he played for Italian club Inter Milan and was captain from 2001 until his retirement in 2014. Having participated in 1,115 official games, he is on the list of men&#x27;s footballers with the most official appearances. He is also the foreign player with the most appearances in Serie A (615), and holds the fourth-most appearances in the league, behind only Gianluigi Buffon, Paolo Maldini and Francesco Totti. He holds the record for the most appearances in the history of Inter (858), as well as the record for the most trophies won with the club, with 16; five Scudetti, four Coppa Italia, four Supercoppa Italiana, one UEFA Cup, one Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup. He also has the most appearances as captain in the Champions League (82).

With the Argentina national team, Zanetti played in 145 games, a figure that makes him the player with the joint-third most appearances in the history of &quot;La Albiceleste&quot;, having formerly held the record from 2007 to 2018. With Argentina he reached the final of the Copa América in 2004 and 2007, and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 1995 and 2005.

On retiring, Inter Milan retired Zanetti&#x27;s number 4 jersey and named him as its vice president. He has been named an ambassador for the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages project in Argentina by FIFA, and in 2005 he received the &quot;Ambrogino d&#x27;Oro&quot; award from the city of Milan for his social initiatives. Zanetti is also a Global Ambassador for the Special Olympics.

== Early life ==
Javier Adelmar Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires to working-class parents of Italian ancestry and grew up in the harbour area in the Dock Sud district, one of the city&#x27;s most notorious areas. His father Rodolfo was a bricklayer and his mother Violeta Bonnazola was a cleaner. Reportedly, some of Zanetti&#x27;s ancestors were Italian settlers brought to southern Chile by Giorgio Ricci in the aftermath of the Occupation of Araucanía (1861–1883). He began playing football on a field in the city suburbs, maintaining the pitch in his spare time. When he was a teenager, he tried out for local club Independiente&#x27;s youth academy, but was ultimately rejected and told that he lacked the physique to succeed in the game. Instead, he concentrated on school and worked as an assistant to his father with masonry as well as odd jobs such as delivering milk and helping out at a relative&#x27;s grocery store.

== Club career ==
=== Talleres ===
After his rejection from Independiente, Zanetti signed for Talleres, then a second division team. With them, he played 33 matches and scored one goal in his only season, before moving in 1993 to the First Division club Banfield.

=== Banfield ===
A 20-year-old Zanetti debuted for Banfield on 12 September 1993 in a home match against River Plate. He scored his first goal 17 days later against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in a match that ended 1–1. His outstanding performances for Banfield gained popularity from &quot;El Taladro&quot; fans and also earned him a call-up from the national team. First division giants River Plate and Boca Juniors displayed interest, but Zanetti decided to stay on for another year at the club. In 1995, along with fellow Argentine Sebastián Rambert, he transferred to Italy&#x27;s Inter Milan, becoming team owner Massimo Moratti&#x27;s first-ever purchase.

=== Inter Milan ===

As a part of the squad for 19 seasons and with 858 appearances across all competitions, he is currently the team&#x27;s longest-tenured player, and the first overall – surpassing Giuseppe Bergomi (758) – in the all-time list of Inter players by most games played.

Throughout his stay with the club, he won 16 trophies, 15 of which came under his captaincy: the UEFA Cup in 1998, the 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2011 Coppa Italia, the 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, the 2005–06, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 &quot;Scudetti&quot; and the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League.

Zanetti went 12 years without being sent off in a match. The first time he was sent off in his career was on 17 February 1999 in a Coppa Italia match against Parma, but he broke his streak when he was sent off in a Serie A match against Udinese on 3 December 2011. These were the only two times he was sent off during his entire career at Inter.

At Inter, Zanetti played under 19 different coaches, making him the only player to have played under this many coaches. He has pledged his future to the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;, hoping to have a future behind the desk at the club in his retirement from playing. &quot;Inter means a lot to me&quot;, Zanetti said.

==== Early career ====
Zanetti made his debut for Inter on 27 August 1995 against Vicenza in Milan. He scored Inter&#x27;s second goal in their 3–0 win over compatriots Lazio in the 1998 UEFA Cup final at the Parc des Princes in Paris, his first silverware at the club, after losing in the final in the previous season.

After two years, in which he consistently wore the captain band in place of the injured Ronaldo, Zanetti was rewarded with the club captaincy in late 2001.

In August 2003, Zanetti signed a new contract with the club until June 2007.

==== Move to midfield ====
After the arrival of Maicon at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Zanetti was moved from the right-back position into midfield. He ended a four-year goal drought when he scored on 5 November 2006 at a home match against Ascoli, having previously scored on 6 November 2002 at an away match against Empoli. On 27 September 2006, against Bayern Munich, Zanetti played his 500th professional match for Inter and on 22 November 2006, he appeared in his 100th UEFA match, against Sporting CP.

Zanetti played an important role in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana match over Roma, scoring his team&#x27;s last penalty in a subsequent shootout win after the regular and extra time ended in a 2–2 draw; this was his first ever career penalty and the third Supercoppa Italiana title. Zanetti then celebrated his 600th match for Inter on 24 September 2008 with a 1–0 win over newly promoted Lecce. Minutes before the match, he was presented with a commemorative plate by former vice-captain Iván Córdoba to mark the occasion.
Though Zanetti is more often classified as a defender, he played mostly in midfield during the first half of the 2008–09 season. For the last several weeks of October 2008, with Inter coach José Mourinho facing a midfield crisis due to injuries to key midfielders Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari, he was moved again to the midfield for the matches against Genoa and Fiorentina. During that period, Mourinho played him in the midfield due to the presence of Maicon, Lúcio, Walter Samuel and Cristian Chivu in the back four.

The 2009–10 season began well for Zanetti and Inter, especially after a 4–0 thrashing of crosstown rivals Milan in the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot;. In the match against Genoa on 17 October, he started off the counter-attack that led to Inter&#x27;s second goal after dispossessing a Genoa player. Inter became the first team of the season to win by a five-goal margin. On 24 October, he reached Giacinto Facchetti&#x27;s record of 476 Serie A appearances when he turned out for the match against Catania, which ended in a 2–1 win for the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;.

Inter won the 2010 Champions League final 2–0 against Bayern Munich on 22 May 2010. This was Zanetti&#x27;s 700th appearance for Inter, and it made him the first player to captain an Italian club to a treble of the &quot;Scudetto&quot;, Coppa Italia and Champions League.

==== Later career ====
On 20 October 2010, at 37 years and 71 days, Zanetti became the oldest player to score in the Champions League when he netted in the opening minute of Inter&#x27;s 4–3 group stage win over Tottenham Hotspur at the San Siro. This was only his second ever Champions League goal; his first came in December 1998 in a match in a 2–0 win against Sturm Graz. He scored one of Inter&#x27;s goals in their 3–0 win against Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma at the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, which they eventually won, although Inter missed out on the UEFA Super Cup that season.
On 19 January 2011, Zanetti overtook Inter legend Giuseppe Bergomi in Serie A appearances, his 520th match in Serie A, all for Inter. On 11 May 2011, Zanetti made his 1,000th appearance as a professional footballer playing for Inter against Roma in the second leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final. On 20 September 2011, Zanetti made the all-time appearance record in a Serie A clash against Novara, surpassing Giuseppe Bergomi.

On 10 March 2013, Zanetti played in his 600th Serie A match for Inter, a 1–0 loss to Bologna at the San Siro. On 21 April 2014, in the 1–0 home win against Parma, Zanetti played his 1,100th official match, and became the player with the fourth-most appearances of all time.

On 29 April 2014, Inter chairman Erick Thohir announced that Zanetti would retire at the end of the 2013–14 season and become a club director. Zanetti&#x27;s last competitive match at the San Siro was a 4–1 victory over Lazio on 10 May 2014. He came on as a substitute for Jonathan Moreira in the 52nd minute and wore a special armband featuring the names of every player he had played with during his career at Inter. He retired after the last game of the season, which he started as centre-back in a 2–1 away defeat to Chievo on 18 May.

== Post-playing career ==
In June 2014, Inter chairman Erick Thohir appointed Zanetti vice-president for a two-year term. Zanetti kept the role upon the change of ownership to the Suning Holdings Group.

On 4 May 2015, during a charitable match at the San Siro, with former and current football stars, organised by Zanetti himself for the opening celebrations for the Expo 2015 in Milan, Inter officially retired Zanetti&#x27;s number 4 jersey.

==International career==
===Debuts and 100th appearance===

Zanetti debuted for Argentina on 16 November 1994 against Chile under coach Daniel Passarella. He was called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, making his competitive debut in team&#x27;s opening group match against Japan which finished in a 1–0 victory. During the 1998 World Cup run, he neatly finished off a Juan Sebastián Verón free kick in the round of 16 match against England making the score 2–2.

Zanetti celebrated his 100th cap by helping Argentina win their 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup semi-final over Mexico on 26 June 2005, in which he won the Man of the Match award. Despite having been part of the team during the qualification rounds, Zanetti was not called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup by coach José Pékerman in a controversial decision.

===2000s===
With new coach Alfio Basile, Zanetti played a friendly match against France on 7 February 2007, helping Javier Saviola to score the only goal of the game that gave Argentina the first victory under Basile&#x27;s second management.
In April 2007, Zanetti was presented with the &quot;National Giuseppe Prisco Award&quot;. After the retirement of Roberto Ayala, Zanetti was given the captain&#x27;s armband. In a World Cup qualification match against Bolivia on 17 November 2007, he became the highest capped player for Argentina.

Zanetti remained a regular footballer under new coach Diego Maradona, although defensive midfielder Javier Mascherano took over as captain at Maradona&#x27;s request. Zanetti&#x27;s place in the starting line up was taken by Jonás Gutiérrez, who had spent the previous season playing on the wing for Newcastle United in England&#x27;s second-tier Football League Championship.

===Return to the Argentine senior squad===
On 20 August 2010, Argentina coach Sergio Batista recalled Zanetti to the squad for a friendly match against Spain played on 7 September 2010 at the River Plate Monumental Stadium, where he and fellow legend Gabriel Batistuta were honored by the Argentine Football Association for their outstanding careers with more than 48,000 people giving them a standing ovation. He was called again for the friendly against Japan at the Saitama in October 2010, but withdrew at the last minute due to injury.

Zanetti was a member of Argentina&#x27;s squad for the 2011 Copa América on home soil, starting in all four of the team&#x27;s matches as they were eliminated by Uruguay in the quarter-finals.

== Style of play ==
Zanetti earned the nickname &quot;El Tractor&quot; for his stamina and tireless energetic runs up and down the wings to aid both attack and defence. He was known amongst his teammates for consistency and fitness regime, which he has credited with prolonging his career. During his last few seasons, he started in over 30 games despite being in his late 30s. As a captain for both his club and international sides, he was well-respected by both fans and the opposition for his leadership, calm demeanor and conduct both on and off the pitch; in his entire 22-year career, he only received two red cards.

Zanetti was a quick, strong and physically fit player in his prime, with outstanding physical attributes, excellent ball control, dribbling, technical ability and acceleration. Defensively, he excelled at reading the game, and he was a good ball-winner and man-marker, although he was also effective at distributing the ball to teammates, due to his passing range and vision. A two-way and two-footed player, he excelled at playing on either flank, where he was capable of advancing into more offensive positions to cross balls for teammates. He also possessed an accurate shot from distance. During his later years at Inter, he was known to have developed a formidable partnership with fellow full-back Maicon, leading the club to win several titles.

Zanetti began his career as a right offensive winger, but was later moved back into midfield, where he became a tactically intelligent and versatile player, who was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or in defence. He was primarily used as a wide midfielder or as a full-back or wing-back on either flank throughout his career, although he has also been deployed as a central defender, sweeper, or as a central or defensive midfielder. He was even deployed in more offensive roles on occasion. Zanetti has been praised for his determination, consistency, and work-rate, as well as his discipline and longevity, which he has attributed to his diligence in training sessions.

== Personal life ==
On 23 December 1999, Zanetti married his long-time girlfriend Paula de la Fuente, the daughter of a university lecturer. They met when he was 19 and she was 14 and dated for seven years prior to their marriage. They live near Lake Como, and they also own a restaurant called El Gaucho in Milan in the Navigli district, a popular tourist area. Paula currently works as a photographer. The couple have a daughter, Sol (born 11 June 2005), and two sons, Ignacio (born 27 July 2008) and Tomás (born 9 May 2012).

Zanetti&#x27;s mother, Violeta Bonazzola, died from a heart attack hours after Inter&#x27;s triumph in 2011 Coppa Italia final. He has published two autobiographies: &quot;Capitano e gentiluomo&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Giocare da uomo&quot; in 2013.

Zanetti is a devout Catholic. Upon the 2013 election of fellow Argentine Pope Francis, Zanetti was invited to the Vatican for an audience with him.

Zanetti is a close friend of Dutch footballer Wesley Sneijder, whom he inspired to convert to Catholicism.

Zanetti&#x27;s elder brother Sergio is a former football defender. Javier Zanetti is not related to Cristiano Zanetti, an Italian who played alongside him for five seasons at Inter.

In 2007, Zanetti collaborated with Italian singer Mina in a Spanish cover of the song &quot;Parole parole&quot;, found in the album &quot;Todavía&quot;.

=== Charity work ===

Zanetti is FIFA ambassador for the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages project in Argentina, and has declared his support for the Mexican Zapatista rebels.

==== Fundación PUPI ====
Zanetti has also shown social conscience when in response to Argentina&#x27;s economic crisis of 2001, which threw millions of people into poverty, Zanetti, with his wife Paula, created the Fundación PUPI in Argentina for the social integration of poor children. The aim of the organization is to help children who were left impoverished by the country&#x27;s economic crisis by giving them educational opportunities, as well as taking care of their nutritional requirements. He explained:
Zanetti, along with his compatriot Esteban Cambiasso, founded this charity association to help coach young children with social isolation problems and motor coordination difficulties. Zanetti said that &quot;this spirit lies at the base of all of Inter&#x27;s initiatives for youngsters:&quot;

=== Media ===
In 2015 Zanetti was the subject of &quot;Zanetti Story&quot;, a documentary film by Simone Scafidi and Carlo A. Sigon.

Zanetti is featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; football video game series; he was included in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 16&quot;.

<text>Cancer Research UK (CRUK) is the world&#x27;s largest independent cancer research organisation. It is registered as a charity in the United Kingdom and Isle of Man, and was formed on 4 February 2002 by the merger of The Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Cancer Research UK conducts research using both its own staff and grant-funded researchers. It also provides information about cancer and runs campaigns aimed at raising awareness and influencing public policy.

The organisation&#x27;s work is almost entirely funded by the public. It raises money through donations, legacies, community fundraising, events, retail and corporate partnerships. Over 25,000 people are regular volunteers.

== History ==
The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) was founded in 1902 as the Cancer Research Fund, changing its name to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in 1904. It grew over the next twenty years to become one of the world&#x27;s leading cancer research charities. Its executive committee was chaired by Sir William Church from its inception in 1902 until 1923. Its flagship laboratories formerly at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, London, and Clare Hall, Hertfordshire, and known as the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, are now part of the Francis Crick Institute.

The British Empire Cancer Campaign (BECC) was founded in 1923, and initially drew a hostile response from ICRF and the Medical Research Council, who considered it a rival. &quot;The Campaign&quot;, as it was colloquially known, became a very successful and powerful grant-giving body. In 1970, the charity was renamed The Cancer Research Campaign (CRC).

Incorporated on 20 November 2001, the two organisations officially merged on 4 February 2002 to form Cancer Research UK, the largest independent cancer research organisation in the world (the largest, the National Cancer Institute, is funded by the US Government). At the time of the merger, the ICRF had an annual income of £124m, while the CRC had an income of £101m.

Based on article share during the period between January 2015 to August 2019, &quot;Nature&quot; listed Cancer Research UK in the top 150 of the Top 200 institutions in cancer research in the world.

CRUK had an income of £718,793,138 and expenditure of £640,845,146 for the financial year ending in 31 March 2023.

On 30 April 2024, King Charles III was announced as patron of the charity. 

==Research==
In the financial year 2014/15, the charity spent £422.67 million on cancer research projects (67% of its total income for that year). The bulk of the remaining costs were spent on trading and fundraising costs with a small amount spent on information services, campaigning, advocacy, administration and other activities or was held in reserve.

Around 40% of its research expenditure (27% of its total spending) is on basic laboratory research into the molecular basis of cancer. The remainder supports research into over 100 specific cancer types, focusing on drug discovery and development; prevention, early detection and imaging; surgery and radiotherapy; and cancers where survival rates are still low, such as oesophageal, lung and pancreatic cancers.

The charity funds the work of over 4,000 researchers, doctors and nurses throughout the UK, supports over 200 clinical trials and studies cancer and cancer risk in over a million people in the UK.

=== Research institutes ===
* The Cancer Research UK Scotland Institute (formerly the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute), which sits within the University of Glasgow and has ties to the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre
* The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, which sits within the University of Cambridge close to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus.
* The Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, formerly the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, which sits within the University of Manchester and has ties to the Christie Hospital.

=== Partnerships ===
* The Francis Crick Institute, with the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust
* The Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, with the Medical Research Council
* The Gurdon Institute, with the Wellcome Trust
* The Manchester Cancer Research Centre, formed in 2006 by the University of Manchester, Cancer Research UK, and the Christie NHS Foundation Trust.
*National Cancer Research Institute which also includes the Medical Research Council (UK) and Blood Cancer UK.
*UK Department of Health, the Wellcome Trust, the National Health Service, NICE, and the Public Health England National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service.

=== Citizen-science projects ===
The charity participates in numerous citizen-science projects including:
* Cell Slider – its first project set up in 2012. Samples of breast cancer tumours, taken from earlier studies, were analysed through a web-based application.
* Play to Cure: Genes in Space – its first mobile game developed with Guerilla Tea, which originated as a prototype during a 48-hour game jam. Players plot routes to guide a spaceship in-game, which corresponds to analysis of genetic data.
* Reverse the Odds – a mobile game based upon &#x27;Play to Cure: Genes in Space&#x27; but with greater accuracy, involved completing puzzles and answering questions on lung and bladder cancer samples.
* The Impossible Line – a mobile puzzle game spotting genetic faults in breast cancer data, provided evidence that the game aspect lowered accuracy.
* Trailblazer – a web-based application looking at tissue samples identifying the presence or absence of cancer cells.

=== Research centres ===
The charity funds networks in seven locations across the UK, to drive collaborations between universities, NHS hospitals, and other research organisations. Centre status is awarded to locations performing the highest quality cancer research, to provide funds for equipment and training. Centre status has been designated to:

* Cambridge: University of Cambridge
* City of London: King&#x27;s College London, University College London, Barts Cancer Institute, Francis Crick Institute
* Convergence Science: Imperial College London and the Institute of Cancer Research
* Manchester: University of Manchester
* Newcastle: Newcastle University
* Oxford: University of Oxford 
* Scotland: University of Edinburgh and University of Glasgow

=== Achievements and impact ===
Drugs developed by the organisation&#x27;s scientists include:
* Cisplatin and carboplatin, cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs discovered at the Institute of Cancer Research in London.
* Abiraterone, a prostate cancer drug discovered at the Institute of Cancer Research in London.
* Temozolomide, which has an effect on glioblastoma, discovered by CRUK scientists at the University of Aston.
* Rucaparib, a PARP inhibitor drug discovered by CRUK scientists including Ruth Plummer at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research .
*Tamoxifen, a hormone therapy used to treat breast cancer and lower the risk of recurrence.

Several of the organisation&#x27;s scientists have won major prizes, including:
* Tomas Lindahl: one of three recipients of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, for mechanistic studies of DNA repair, joined the organisation as a researcher in 1981, and from 1986 was the first Director of their Clare Hall research institute in Hertfordshire, since 2015 part of the Francis Crick Institute.
* Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt: recipients of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for work started at the London Research Institute.
* Renato Dulbecco: recipient of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, while deputy director of what was then the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.

== Other charitable activities ==

=== Information services ===
Through Cancer Health UK, a website written in Plain English, it provides information on cancer and cancer care, and a unique clinical trials database. A team of nurses provides a confidential telephone service, the Cancer Chat forum provides a place for users to talk to others affected by cancer, and mobile cancer awareness units deliver health information to locations of high cancer incidence and mortality. It provides statistical information via the Cancer Stats section. It also provides publications for the public to order and download.

Cancer Research UK publishes a twice-monthly professional medical journal, the &quot;British Journal of Cancer&quot;.

=== Influencing public policy ===
The charity worked to bring about the smoking ban in England and continues to campaign for further action on smoking. The charity lobbies for better screening programmes and advises on access to new cancer medicines.

== Sources of funding ==

Income sources include:
* Individual donations, regular giving and philanthropy, raising £191 million in 2019/20.
* Legacies from wills, raising £184 million in 2019/20.
* Royalties and grants from licensing its intellectual property, such as for the drug abiraterone, generating £118 million in 2019/20.
* Public participation fundraising events such as Race for Life, Stand Up to Cancer UK and a one off Race Against Cancer, raising £48 million in 2019/20.
* Around 600 charity shops selling new and donated second-hand goods, generating £10 million profit in 2019/20.

On 18 July 2012, it was announced that Cancer Research UK was to receive its largest single donation of £10 million from an anonymous donor. The money went towards the £100 million funding for the Francis Crick Institute in London.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, CRUK closed its shops and cancelled mass participation fundraising events. They predicted that this, coupled with economic uncertainty affecting people&#x27;s ability or willingness to donate, would lead to a 30% fall in income that year and a reduction in income lasting at least 3 years.

==Criticism==
In June 2011, Cancer Research UK was one of several health charities (along with the British Heart Foundation, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society and Parkinson&#x27;s UK) targeted by the animal rights organisation Animal Aid in a series of advertisements in British newspapers urging members of the public to stop giving donations to organisations that fund medical research involving animal experiments.

In April 2017, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office fined eleven charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors’ personal data. Cancer Research UK was fined £16,000.

<doc id="615796" wikidata="Q4868103" url="?curid=615796" title="Bassett-Lowke">
<text>Bassett-Lowke was an English toy manufacturing company based in Northampton. Founded by Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke in 1898 or 1899, the company specialized in model railways, boats and ships, and construction sets. Bassett-Lowke started as a mail-order business, although it designed and manufactured some items.

The company closed in 1965, with its rights to brand acquired by Corgi Toys. When Corgi was taken over by Hornby in 2008, it secured rights to the &quot;Bassett-Lowke&quot; brand, which is still commercialising.

== Overview ==

Bassett-Lowke was a sales organization, contracting manufacturers such as Twining Models and Winteringham Ltd, also of Northampton. Until World War I, the company also carried models made by Bing and Märklin.

===Today=== 
The name Bassett-Lowke is mostly associated with model trains but the company also had a long history of contracting skilled craftsmen to make 100 ft. to 1 inch or 1/1200 scale military and civilian waterline ship models out of wood and wire. These detailed hand crafted waterline ship models are so highly desired by ship model collectors that they often command higher prices than the Bassett-Lowke model trains. Something that is not well known is that Bassett-Lowke also sold less detailed waterline models cast in white metal.

Roland Fuller on page 49 of his book, &quot;The Bassett-Lowke Story&quot;, states that in the London Bassett-Lowke store on High Holborn St. there was such a demand for the hand-made waterline 100 ft. to 1 inch scale wooden ship models that the company had to make available to its customers a less expensive line of waterline ship models, cast in white metal, to meet the demand. The name of the casting company supplying these inexpensive white metal ship models for Bassett-Lowke customers was Brighton Manufacturing Company, a company using the initials B.M.C. to identify their products. The B.M.C. Company was located at 32 Great St Helens, London, England. This metal casting company was a neighbor to Bassett-Lowke, its store being within walking distance from the Bassett-Lowke shop located on High Holborn St. 

Roland Fuller describes in extensive detail the range of inexpensive metal ships offered to Bassett-Lowke customers. He states the metal ship models could be purchased individually or could be purchased in numbered boxed sets. 

Illustrations of these same metal waterline ship models appear in a book by Derek Head. On pages 11 and 15 In his book &quot;Bassett-Lowke Waterline Ship Models&quot;, Mr. Head provides excerpts of a few pages of the Bassett-Lowke war time catalog. These excerpted catalog pages contain illustrations of metal ship models sold in numbered boxed sets matching the exact description of the numbered boxed sets of metal ship models described in the Roland Fuller book. The presence of these metal ship models in the Bassett-Lowke war time model ship catalog can be explained by the following:

Derek Head describes on page 11 of his book that at beginning of World War One, government censors prohibited Bassett-Lowke from selling or advertising their line of detailed 100 ft. to 1 inch or 1/1200 scale models of the Royal Navy. The concern of the censors was that the accuracy of these detailed models could give vital information to the enemy. 

In order to have some representation of the Royal Navy for their war time catalog, Bassett-Lowke replaced their prohibited Royal Navy models by purchasing the less detailed metal ship models of the Royal Navy made by the neighboring company, B.M.C. These metal B.M.C. models while detailed, had their origins as game models and were therefore less accurate depictions of Royal Navy Warships. This lack of sharp detail was apparently found acceptable to the government censors and therefore they were allowed to appear in the catalog. 

The resulting model fleet in metal carried in the Bassett-Lowke war time catalogue was of every class of ship in the British navy then in commission as of 1914. The models found in the collection range from the early 1889 Royal Sovereign class Pre-Dreadnoughts, some of which had been retained by the navy as bombardment ships, through to eventually the newest Revenge class Super-Dreadnoughts which had just come into service. The 1917 Bassett-Lowke catalogue proudly boasts that &quot;Practically every ship in the Navy has been modelled, including Super-Dreadnoughts, Battleships, Battle Cruisers, Armoured Cruisers, Light Cruisers, Destroyers, Torpedo Boats, Submarines, Mine Layers, Mine Sweepers, Troopships, Transports, Armed Liners and all Auxiliary Craft&quot;. The models were formed in lead with the wire masts cast into the hulls in a scale of one inch to 150 feet or 1/1800. They were painted and issued in numbered boxed sets by Bassett-Lowke, the boxes bearing the label “H.M.S. Irresistible”. Paper flags were supplied with each set, to be cut out and applied to the masts and sternposts.

Every class of vessel was easily recognizable by the funnels, guns and masts. While rudimentary by later standards, the B.M.C. production of over 101 different castings was the first scale metal ship model fleet ever produced and established the precedent for all subsequent scale metal waterline recognition ship models. In addition to the ship models, B.M.C. produced a fort with movable guns, four lighthouses and a game featuring a large fold-out map of the Dardanelles channel showing forts and minefields. The game was supplied with fifteen metal ship models including two mine sweepers and two submarines
This collaboration between Bassett-Lowke and B.M.C. was a great benefit to both companies. It allowed Bassett-Lowke to have a representation of the Royal Navy in their war time catalogue that was acceptable to the government censors and at the same time it gave the small metal casting company of B.M.C. a broader venue for the sales of their metal ship models. In the time period of the First World War, these metal B.M.C. ship models were the only examples of waterline warship models of the Royal Navy sold by Bassett-Lowke and are therefore deserving of a more detailed review than has normally been accorded to them.
The B.M.C. waterline ship models had been cast by an independent company which had been selling their metal waterline ship models for over 10 years through advertisement and through shops specializing in military miniatures. Early in the century this small company had begun supplying lead waterline game models to the publishers of the Fred T. Janes Naval War Game, supplementing the pressed cork and wire waterline game models already being supplied to the game by others. The accomplishment of B.M.C. is that this garage sized company had, by 1903 begun the creation of the first commercially available metal waterline ship models made in a uniform scale to each other. 
B.M.C. SHIP MODELS AVAILABLE TODAY

The B.M.C. ship models often appear for sale on internet auctions and at toy shows. Many times at these sales the B.M.C. models are found mixed with copies made by two later companies. The B.M.C. models can be distinguished from the copies since only the B.M.C. models have full-length wire masts cast into the hulls. The first type of copies are 31 models made by &quot;Minifigs&quot; These are cast in solid lead, have no wire masts and have large numbers inscribed on the bottom. The second type of copies comprise a group of four models made by Crescent which are cast in pot metal. They have numbers near the starboard stern numbering B.1, B.2, B.3, or B.4. Curiously, these pot-metal models retain the same numbering system that is cast into the hulls of the four B.M.C models from which they were derived.
These Crescent copies mimic the B.M.C. castings of the B.I Duncan, B.II Swiftsure, B.III King Edward VII, and the B.IV Lord Nelson. It is unknown when Bassett-Lowke ceased carrying the B.M.C metal ship models, however Derek Head in his book on page 12, states that metal ship models continued to be carried until the 1920’s.

In the present day, the larger highly accurate wood and wire ship models in the scale of one inch to 1200 inches or 1:1200, is are what command the high prices at auction. These hand crafted ship models continued to be sold commercially until the mid1960&#x27;s and had also been purchased by the military for recognition and war gaming purpose. Unlike the B.M.C. metal models, which were carried only briefly by Bassett-Lowke in the early years and are a mystery to most collectors, the larger highly finished 100 to 1 inch or 1/1200 scale wooden ship models are greatly sought after by collectors and command high prices at auctions. The Derek Head book, &quot;Bassett-Lowke Waterline Ship Models&quot; will reward ship model collectors with an extensive and colorful survey of both the metal B.M.C. ships and the expensive, detailed, hand-crafted ship models, many from his own collection.

===Model Trains===

Bassett-Lowke produced trains from 15-inch (381 mm) gauge live steam models to Gauge 2, Gauge 1 and 0 gauge trains.

The first 15-inch steam locomotive, test run on the Eaton Hall Railway in 1905, was &quot;Little Giant&quot;. Unlike other engines on the line, it was a replica of main-line locos, built for a public miniature railway at Blackpool. It was a quarter-scale 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; tender engine, though not an exact copy of any particular prototype. That engine still exists in private ownership.

In 1909, along with Henry Greenly, W.J. Bassett-Lowke started and edited Model Railways and Locomotives Magazine.

In 1914, Bassett-Lowke produced the second &quot;Pacific&quot; 4-6-2 of any size built in Britain (the first was GWR 111 &quot;The Great Bear&quot;). That was &quot;John Anthony&quot;, built for a miniature railway at Staughton Manor, Cambridgeshire. It was never delivered, but after storage at Eaton Hall during World War I, was sold to the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway and renamed &quot;Colossus.&quot; It was scrapped in 1927. Ravenglass and Eskdale had purchased another Bassett-Lowke Atlantic, the &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;.
In the 1920s, Bassett-Lowke introduced 00 gauge products. The company provided custom-built railways, and one such gauge 1 layout survives in modified format at Bekonscot Model Village in England.

In 1939, Bassett-Lowke was tasked with producing a working model of Churchill&#x27;s trench-digging tank known as Cultivator No. 6.
Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s decline, starting in the late 1950s, can be blamed on at least two factors: people would browse the firm&#x27;s free catalogue and buy similar or nearly identical items elsewhere at lower price; and the interest in technical toys declined in the late 1950s and even more in the 1960s. Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s fall was mirrored by its U.S. counterparts, the A. C. Gilbert Company and Lionel Corporation. In 1964, the company ceased retail sales and sold its shops, including one at High Holborn in London, to Beatties. Bassett-Lowke went out of business in 1965.

In 1966, the company was acquired by Messrs Riley and Derry. Around 1969, Ivan Rutherford Scott, Allen L. Levy and Roland H. Fuller apparently made an effort to revive the model railway business. In the late 1980s, Nigel Turner, a Northampton businessman, bought the business and based it next to his business, Turner&#x27;s Musical Merry-Go-Round, near Wootton, Northamptonshire. In 1993, the name was revived with short-run white-metal models. These included a Burrell-type traction engine, Clayton undertype steam wagon, Burrell-type steam roller, and a London B-type bus. The name was acquired in 1996 by Corgi, which linked it with live steam 0-gauge locomotives.

Key competitors to Bassett-Lowke were Hornby and Exley. Hornby acquired Corgi in 2008 and originally continued to make the 0 gauge models before later discontinuing them. The brand name was revived by them in 2020 for a range of 00 scale steampunk models based on existing Hornby toolings.

== Narrow Gauge Railways Ltd ==

In 1912 W. J. Bassett-Lowke, Robert Proctor-Mitchell and John Wills set up &quot;Narrow Gauge Railways Ltd&quot; (NGR) to promote and run  railways. An earlier company, Miniature Railways of Great Britain Ltd, went into voluntary liquidation in 1912. NGR&#x27;s first railway opened in 1912 at Luna Park in the Parc des Eaux Vives, Geneva, Switzerland. In Britain, the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway was taken over, converted to gauge and re-opened in 1915. The Fairbourne Railway in Wales followed in 1916.

==Hornby==

The Bassett-Lowke name was purchased by Corgi after the company dissolved in 1965, who used it for Corgi Classics. Corgi (and the Bassett-Lowke brand) was bought by Hornby in 2008 who used it for traditional sheet metal railway models. In 2020 Bassett-Lowke branding was used by Hornby to launch a range of steampunk inspired railway models. In 2021 brick-based construction models with steampunk themes were released under the Bassett-Lowke branding as the &#x27;brickpunk&#x27; range aimed at both children and adults.

== Locomotives ==
Bassett-Lowke locomotives were often renamed when moved to different railways, sometimes creating uncertainty about whether a locomotive is new or an old one with a new name. The list (probably incomplete) is not definitive. Most of Bassett-Lowke&#x27;s locomotives were designed by Henry Greenly who was a contributor to Model Engineer magazine.

<doc id="615797" wikidata="Q295262" url="?curid=615797" title="Carlos Alberto Torres">
<text>Carlos Alberto &quot;Capita&quot; Torres (17 July 1944 – 25 October 2016), also known as &quot;O Capitão do Tri&quot;, was a Brazilian football player and manager who played as an attacking right-sided full-back or wing-back. A technically gifted defender with good ball skills and defensive capabilities, he is widely regarded as one of the best defenders of all time. He also stood out for his leadership, and was an excellent penalty taker. Nicknamed &quot;O Capitão&quot;, he captained the Brazil national team to victory in the 1970 World Cup, scoring the fourth goal in the final, considered one of the greatest goals in the history of the tournament.

Carlos Alberto was a member of the World Team of the 20th Century, and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. He was an inductee to the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, and was a member of the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame.

In January 2013, Carlos Alberto was named one of the six Ambassadors of 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, others being Ronaldo, Bebeto, Mário Zagallo, Amarildo and Marta.

==Personal life==
Carlos Alberto was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1944. He had a twin brother, Carlos Roberto, who died one month before him in 2016. His son is fellow player Carlos Alexandre Torres and his daughter Andrea Torres.

==Club career==
===Brazil===
Carlos Alberto joined Fluminense at the age of 19. He made a name for himself in his first season, not only because of his great tackling and reading of the game, but also for his outstanding ball control, dribbling and playmaking abilities, which were quite rare at the time for a defender. In 1966, he moved to Santos, where he became Pelé&#x27;s teammate. In 1974, he returned to Fluminense and helped the team capture two consecutive Campeonato Carioca championships. In 1977, he moved to Fluminense&#x27;s arch-rivals Flamengo.

===NASL===
In 1977, despite his success in Brazil, Carlos Alberto Torres decided to move to the New York Cosmos. He arrived on the day of the New York City blackout where he was reunited with his friend and partner Pelé and helped the Cosmos capture two consecutive NASL titles in 1977 and 1978. After spending one year with the California Surf, he returned to the Cosmos in 1982 where he won his third NASL title. He played his farewell game on 28 September 1982 in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and his former club Flamengo. In 119 regular season games and 26 playoff games, Carlos scored a total of 8 goals and was an NASL All-Star five times.

==International career==

From 1964 to 1977, Carlos Alberto was capped 53 times and scored 8 goals. He was included in the 44-man training squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup but did not make the final 22. As it turned out, Brazil were knocked out at the Group stage in England, and when João Saldanha was tasked with restoring pride and passion to the &quot;seleção&quot;, he recognised the leadership ability that Carlos Alberto was consistently demonstrating at Santos, and made him national captain. Thus, Carlos Alberto is remembered holding aloft the Jules Rimet trophy after Brazil secured the cup for good after an impressive victory over Italy in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final in Mexico City. That squad also included Clodoaldo, Gérson, Jairzinho, Rivellino, Tostão and Pelé. Carlos Alberto&#x27;s goal against Italy in the final is considered one of the best goals ever scored in the tournament. In 2002 the UK public voted the goal No. 36 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. 1970 would prove to be the only time he would play at that level. He was unable to participate in the 1974 World Cup due to a persistent knee injury. When he eventually regained match fitness, his speed had been compromised. However, his ability to read the game compensated for his loss of pace and when he moved to centre back, he found the form to warrant a recall to the national team. In 1977, he was selected by Claudio Coutinho to captain the national team for the first three qualifiers for the 1978 World Cup. He acquitted himself well despite those being the first competitive internationals he had played for almost seven years. He was approaching 33 years of age and retired from international football, immediately prior to joining New York Cosmos in the NASL. Today he is widely considered one of the finest Brazilian men&#x27;s footballers of all time.

==Coaching career==

His career as a football manager started in 1983, when he managed Flamengo. He also managed several other clubs, like Corinthians in 1985 and 1986; Náutico in 1986, 1987 and 1988; Once Caldas on 1989, 1990; Monterrey in 1991, 1992; Club Tijuana in 1992; Fluminense in 1994 and 1995; Botafogo in 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003; Querétaro F.C. in 1999; Unión Magdalena in 2000, 2001; and Paysandu in 2005.

He was also an assistant manager for national teams such as the Nigeria national football team and the Oman national football team. On 14 February 2004, he was appointed manager of the Azerbaijan national football team. He resigned on 4 June 2005 after losing a match against Poland, during which he assaulted the technical referee and ran on the pitch suggesting the referee was bribed.

==Death==
Carlos Alberto died in Rio de Janeiro on 25 October 2016 due to a sudden heart attack. He was a sports commentator at a Brazilian channel SporTV, having appeared live on studio only two days before his death, which occurred exactly one month after his twin died.

<text>Computer forensics (also known as computer forensic science) is a branch of digital forensic science pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital storage media. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing, and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.

Although it is most often associated with the investigation of a wide variety of computer crime, computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to data recovery, but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal audit trail.

Evidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices as other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.

==Overview==
In the early 1980s, personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit fraud). At the same time, several new &quot;computer crimes&quot; were recognized (such as cracking). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate digital evidence for use in court. Since then, computer crime and computer-related crime has grown, with the FBI reporting a suspected 791,790 internet crimes in 2020, a 69% increase over the amount reported in 2019. Today, computer forensics is used to investigate a wide variety of crimes, including child pornography, fraud, espionage, cyberstalking, murder, and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (e.g., Electronic discovery).

Forensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a &quot;digital artifact&quot;, such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g., hard disk or CD-ROM), or an electronic document (e.g., an email message or JPEG image). The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple information retrieval to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, &quot;Computer Forensics&quot;, authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving &quot;the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data&quot;. They describe the discipline as &quot;more of an art than a science,&quot; indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer, the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.

=== Cybersecurity ===
Computer forensics is often confused with cybersecurity. Cybersecurity focuses on prevention and protection, while computer forensics is more reactionary and active, involving activities such as tracking and exposing. System security usually encompasses two teams: cybersecurity and computer forensics, which work together. A cybersecurity team creates systems and programs to protect data; if these fail, the computer forensics team recovers the data and investigates the intrusion and theft. Both areas require knowledge of computer science.

=== Computer-related crimes ===
Computer forensics are used to convict those involved in physical and digital crimes. Some of these computer-related crimes include interruption, interception, copyright infringement, and fabrication. &quot;Interruption&quot; relates to the destruction and stealing of computer parts and digital files. &quot;Interception&quot; is the unauthorized access of files and information stored on technological devices. Copyright infringement refers to using, reproducing, and distributing copyrighted information, including software piracy. &quot;Fabrication&quot; involves accusing someone of using false data and information inserted into the system through an unauthorized source. Examples of interceptions include the Bank NSP case, Sony.Sambandh.com case, and business email compromise scams.

==Use as evidence==
In court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for digital evidence. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible. Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the United Kingdom, examiners often follow Association of Chief Police Officers guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.

Computer forensics has been used as evidence in criminal law since the mid-1980s. Some notable examples include:
* BTK Killer: Dennis Rader was convicted of a string of serial killings over sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. Metadata within the documents implicated an author named &quot;Dennis&quot; at &quot;Christ Lutheran Church,&quot; helping lead to Rader&#x27;s arrest.
* Joseph Edward Duncan: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan&#x27;s computer contained evidence showing him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to demonstrate premeditation and secure the death penalty.
* Sharon Lopatka: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka&#x27;s computer led investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.
* Corcoran Group: In this case, computer forensics confirmed parties&#x27; duties to preserve digital evidence when litigation had commenced or was reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed, though the expert found no evidence of deletion, and evidence showed that the defendants intentionally destroyed emails.
* Dr. Conrad Murray: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of Michael Jackson, was convicted partially by digital evidence, including medical documentation showing lethal amounts of propofol.

== Forensic process ==
Computer forensic investigations typically follow the standard digital forensic process, consisting of four phases: acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting. Investigations are usually performed on static data (i.e., acquired images) rather than &quot;live&quot; systems. This differs from early forensic practices, when a lack of specialized tools often required investigators to work on live data.

=== Computer forensics lab ===
The computer forensics lab is a secure environment where electronic data can be preserved, managed, and accessed under controlled conditions, minimizing the risk of damage or alteration to the evidence. Forensic examiners are provided with the resources necessary to extract meaningful data from the devices they examine.

=== Techniques ===
Various techniques are used in computer forensic investigations, including:

; Cross-drive analysis
: This technique correlates information found on multiple hard drives and can be used to identify social networks or detect anomalies.

; Live analysis
: The examination of computers from within the operating system using forensic or existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This technique is particularly useful for dealing with encrypting file systems where encryption keys can be retrieved, or for imaging the logical hard drive volume (a live acquisition) before shutting down the computer. Live analysis is also beneficial when examining networked systems or cloud-based devices that cannot be accessed physically.

; Deleted files
: A common forensic technique involves recovering deleted files. Most operating systems and file systems do not erase the physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical disk sectors. Forensic software can &quot;carve&quot; files by searching for known file headers and reconstructing deleted data.

; Stochastic forensics
: This method leverages the stochastic properties of a system to investigate activities without traditional digital artifacts, often useful in cases of data theft.

; Steganography
: Steganography involves concealing data within another file, such as hiding illegal content within an image. Forensic investigators detect steganography by comparing file hashes, as any hidden data will alter the hash value of the file.

=== Mobile device forensics ===
; Phone logs
: Phone companies typically retain logs of received calls, which can help create timelines and establish suspects&#x27; locations at the time of a crime.

; Contacts
: Contact lists are useful in narrowing down suspects based on their connections to the victim.

; Text messages
: Text messages contain timestamps and remain in company servers, often indefinitely, even if deleted from the device. These records are valuable evidence for reconstructing communication between individuals.

; Photos
: Photos can provide critical evidence, supporting or disproving alibis by showing the location and time they were taken.

; Audio recordings
: Some victims may have recorded pivotal moments, capturing details like the attacker&#x27;s voice, which could provide crucial evidence.

=== Volatile data ===
Volatile data is stored in memory or in transit and is lost when the computer is powered down. It resides in locations such as registries, cache, and RAM. The investigation of volatile data is referred to as &quot;live forensics.&quot;

When seizing evidence, if a machine is still active, volatile data stored solely in RAM may be lost if not recovered before shutting down the system. &quot;Live analysis&quot; can be used to recover RAM data (e.g., using Microsoft&#x27;s COFEE tool, WinDD, WindowsSCOPE) before removing the machine. Tools like CaptureGUARD Gateway allow for the acquisition of physical memory from a locked computer.

RAM data can sometimes be recovered after power loss, as the electrical charge in memory cells dissipates slowly. Techniques like the cold boot attack exploit this property. Lower temperatures and higher voltages increase the chance of recovery, but it is often impractical to implement these techniques in field investigations.

Tools that extract volatile data often require the computer to be in a forensic lab to maintain the chain of evidence. In some cases, a live desktop can be transported using tools like a mouse jiggler to prevent sleep mode and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to maintain power.

Page files from file systems with journaling features, such as NTFS and ReiserFS, can also be reassembled to recover RAM data stored during system operation.

=== Analysis tools ===

Numerous open-source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics. Common forensic analysis includes manual reviews of media, Windows registry analysis, password cracking, keyword searches, and the extraction of emails and images. Tools such as Autopsy (software), Belkasoft Evidence Center, Forensic Toolkit (FTK), and EnCase are widely used in digital forensics.

== Professional education and careers ==

=== Digital forensics analyst ===
A digital forensics analyst is responsible for preserving digital evidence, cataloging collected evidence, analyzing evidence relevant to the ongoing case, responding to cyber breaches (often in a corporate context), writing reports containing findings, and testifying in court. A digital forensic analyst may also be referred to as a computer forensic analyst, digital forensic examiner, cyber forensic analyst, forensic technician, or other similarly named titles, though these roles perform similar duties.

=== Certifications ===
Several computer forensics certifications are available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP), and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner. The top vendor-independent certification, particularly within the EU, is the Certified Cyber Forensics Professional (CCFP).

Many commercial forensic software companies also offer proprietary certifications.

<doc id="615800" wikidata="Q178683" url="?curid=615800" title="Cafu">
<text>Marcos Evangelista de Morais (born 7 June 1970), known as Cafu (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a right-back. Widely regarded as one of the greatest full-backs of all time, he is known for his pace and energetic attacking runs along the right flank He is the most-capped player for the Brazil national team with 142 appearances.

At club level, Cafu won several domestic and international titles while playing in Brazil, Spain, and Italy; he is best known for his spells at São Paulo (1989–1995), Roma (1997–2003), and AC Milan (2003–08), teams with which he made history, although he also played briefly for Zaragoza, Juventude, and Palmeiras during a two-year spell from 1995 to 1997. In 1994, Cafu was crowned South American Footballer of the Year, and in 2004, was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. He was additionally named to the FIFPro World XI in 2005, and in 2020 was included in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team.

Cafu represented his nation in four FIFA World Cups between 1994 and 2006, and is the only player in history to have appeared in three World Cup finals, both overall and consecutive, winning the 1994 and 2002 editions of the tournament, the latter as his team&#x27;s captain where he lifted the World Cup trophy. With Brazil, he also took part in four editions of the Copa América, winning the title twice, in 1997 and 1999; he was also a member of the national side that won the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup.

One of six children, Cafu was raised in the Jardim Irene favela of São Paulo. At the age of seven, he was able to attend a football academy and soon moved up to the junior sides of Nacional-SP, Portuguesa, and Itaquaquecetuba. He also played futsal for two years.

As a child he received the nickname &#x27;Cafu&#x27;, in honor of the Brazilian winger Cafuringa.

In the early 1980s, he was rejected from the youth squads of Corinthians, Palmeiras, Santos, Atlético Mineiro, and Portuguesa, but it was not until 1988 that he made the youth squad of hometown club São Paulo, and subsequently won the &quot;Copa São Paulo&quot; youth tournament that year, but he did not play during the next season as São Paulo won the 1989 Campeonato Paulista.

==Club career==

It was during this time, however, that São Paulo youth coach Telê Santana became Cafu&#x27;s mentor. He suggested that Cafu move from right midfield to wingback, a spot into which Cafu made the transition with ease despite never previously playing the position. He had soon anchored onto the first team, as São Paulo won back-to-back Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup in 1992 and 1993. In 1994, he was named the South American Footballer of the Year. Halfway through the 1994–95 season, Cafu joined Spanish side Real Zaragoza, winning the 1995 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with them (though he had injury issues and did not play in the final). He then left Zaragoza to join Brazilian club Juventude.

After a brief stint back in Brazil with Palmeiras in 1996, Cafu returned to Europe once again the next year, this time with Roma, and won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; in 2001. It was during his tenure at Roma that Cafu earned the nickname &quot;Il Pendolino&quot; (&quot;The Express Train&quot; or &quot;The Commuter&quot;). Despite making the Coppa Italia final in 2003 with Roma, he moved to AC Milan, after turning down a move to Japan with Yokohama F. Marinos. With the &quot;Rossoneri&quot;, he won his second career Scudetto in 2004, followed by his second Supercoppa Italiana, and he played in his first UEFA Champions League final in 2005. The following season, he made fewer appearances for Milan due to injury and difficulties in his personal life.

Despite his success with Milan, he continued to hold fond memories of his Roma years, and it was for that reason that on 4 March 2007 – the day after Milan eliminated Celtic in the first knockout round of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League – he candidly revealed in a UEFA.com chat that he did not want Milan to be drawn against the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; in the quarter-final round. He got his wish, as Milan were drawn against Bayern Munich. Milan&#x27;s successful Champions League campaign saw Cafu finally pick up a long-awaited winners&#x27; medal, in a rematch of the 2005 final.

Cafu signed a contract extension in May 2007 that would keep him with Milan until the end of the 2007–08 season, during which he won another UEFA Supercup, and his third world title at club level and now his first FIFA Club World Cup. On 16 May 2008, it was announced that Cafu and compatriot Serginho would be leaving Milan at the end of the season. In Cafu&#x27;s last game of his Milan career, and of his professional career, he scored a goal in their 4–1 victory over Udinese. Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani stated that the door would be open to him to return to work for the club.

He is a member of the AC Milan and the Roma Halls of Fame.

===Passport controversy===
Cafu was accused along with several other Serie A players, including Roma teammate Fábio Júnior and Gustavo Bartelt, countryman and later Milan teammate Dida, of using a forged passport in their attempt to dodge regulations regarding the number of non-European players allowed on Italian club rosters. However, the charge was cleared by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as Cafu&#x27;s Italian passport was real and issued by Italian officials, but 13 others – including Dida – were banned. But Cafu faced another controversy that similar to Juan Sebastián Verón, accused that Cafu&#x27;s wife, Regina used falsified documents to claim Italian nationality through Italian descent. Cafu acquired Italian nationality through marriage. In 2004, Cafu and Roma club president Franco Sensi went to court.

On 12 June 2006, less than 24 hours before Brazil were to begin their 2006 World Cup campaign against Croatia, Rome prosecutor Angelantonio Racanelli called for the imprisonment of Cafu, his wife and his agent for nine months following the resurfacing of a false-passport scandal. The very next day, however, Cafu, his wife and agent were acquitted of all charges.

==International career==

Cafu is the most-capped Brazilian men&#x27;s player of all time with 142 appearances, including a record 20 World Cup games. He has won two World Cups in 1994 and 2002, as well as being the only player to participate in three World Cup final matches. Cafu also held the record of winning the most matches in World Cups with 15 (along with two games Brazil won on penalties), before being surpassed by Germany&#x27;s Miroslav Klose in the 2014 World Cup.

He earned his first cap in a friendly against Spain on 12 September 1990, and played sparingly for Brazil in the early 1990s, making the 1994 World Cup roster as a substitute. He appeared in the final against Italy, following an injury to Jorginho in the 22nd minute. After that, Cafu was soon a regular in the starting eleven as Brazil won the Copa América in 1997 and 1999, the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, and reached the 1998 World Cup final.

Brazil endured a rocky qualification for the 2002 tournament, during which Cafu came under heavy criticism from coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo, who stripped him of the team captaincy after he was sent off in a qualifier against Paraguay. Shortly after that, however, Luxemburgo was out of a job, and replacement Luiz Felipe Scolari made Emerson his new choice for captain. However, Emerson missed the cut after he dislocated his shoulder in training, which allowed Cafu to regain the armband. After Brazil defeated Germany 2–0 in the final match (Cafu&#x27;s third consecutive World Cup final), he stood on the victory podium during the postmatch celebration and, as he raised the World Cup trophy, shouted to his wife, &quot;Regina, eu te amo!&quot; (&quot;Regina, I love you!&quot;). Cafu had also written &quot;100% Jardim Irene&quot; on his shirt as an homage to his upbringing. Three days after World Cup victory, Cafu spent some time in Bangu on Amanajó Street alongside former Bangu AC coach and notable fan Pombo and his cousin, a long time Cafu&#x27;s friend.

Cafu and Brazil fell short of high expectations placed on the squad four years later in 2006, as Brazil meekly exited in the quarter-finals after a 1–0 defeat by France. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was criticized for featuring fading veterans, most notably the 36-year-old Cafu and 33-year-old Roberto Carlos, in the starting eleven in lieu of younger players. Cafu was one of few Brazil players who spoke to the press in the midst of a hailstorm of criticism from Brazilian fans and media alike following the team&#x27;s return home.

==Style of play==

Regarded as one of the greatest full-backs of all time, one of the best footballers of his generation, and as one of Brazil&#x27;s best ever players, Cafu was a dynamic, hard-working, offensive-minded, and energetic right-sided wing-back who is mostly remembered for his great pace, stamina, tactical intelligence, distribution, and technical skills, as well as his ability to make overlapping attacking runs down the right flank and provide accurate crosses to teammates in the area.

In addition to his footballing ability, he was also known for his discipline, leadership and his characteristically cheerful demeanour. Although he usually played as an attacking right-back, he was also capable of playing as a centre back, due to his defensive skills, or in more advanced positions, and was often deployed as a right winger. During his time in Italy, he was given the nickname &quot;Pendolino&quot;, after the country&#x27;s express trains.

==Personal life==
Cafu is separated from his wife Regina Feliciano, who he married in 1987. The couple had three children together: two sons (Danilo and Wellington) and a daughter (Michelle). On 4 September 2019, Danilo suffered a heart attack whilst playing football at his family home, after complaining about feeling unwell. Danilo was taken to hospital, where he later died.

<doc id="615805" wikidata="Q311424" url="?curid=615805" title="Léo Júnior">
<text>Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior (born 29 June 1954), also known as Léo Júnior or simply Júnior, is a Brazilian football pundit and retired footballer who played as a left back or midfielder.

He was nicknamed &quot;capacete&quot; (&quot;helmet&quot;, in Portuguese) because of his afro hairstyle.

He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. Junior now works as a television pundit for Rede Globo.

==Club career==

Léo Júnior played for Flamengo during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, winning four Brazilian Championships (1980, 1982, 1983, 1992), the 1981 Copa Libertadores and 1981 Intercontinental Cup. With 857 matches, he is the player with most appearances for Flamengo.

On 12 June 1984 he was bought by Torino, for a fee of two million dollars. Léo Júnior asked and obtained a guarantee to play as a midfielder rather than a full-back, because he considered the former role less stressful, so to extend the life of his career. Although he was now thirty years old, after some initial difficulties, he succeeded in integrating in the formation coached by Luigi Radice, becoming the leader of the midfield. During his first year in Italy was the victim of two incidents of racism: in Milan he was repeatedly insulted and spat upon as he left the stadium with his mother and father and in Turin, on the occasion of the derby, Juventus fans exhibited offensive banners on the colour of his skin. The Torino supporters responded promptly with another banner: &quot;Better negro than a Juventus fan&quot;. At the end of the season, finished second behind Verona, he was awarded Serie A&#x27;s player of the year.

During his time with &quot;Toro&quot; he was also given the affectionate nickname of &quot;papà Júnior&quot;, due to his elder appearance. He remained in Turin until 1987, when he had a fallout with the manager Radice. The coach believed the performance of the Brazilian lower than that of the first season, while Léo Júnior was particularly annoyed for being substituted during a UEFA Cup tie against HNK Hajduk Split, which culminated with the elimination of the team.

He also played for Italian club Pescara between 1987 and 1989.

In early June 1991 he returned to Torino for a short spell on loan from Flamengo to bolster their team while participating in the Mitropa Cup. With Júnior in fine form, Torino won the tournament.

==International career==
Léo Júnior competed in the men&#x27;s tournament at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

He went on to record 74 appearances for the Brazil national team, between May 1979 and December 1992, scoring six goals. He appeared in both the 1982 and 1986 World Cup.

He also took part in many Beach Soccer World Championships as part of the Brazil national team, winning awards for top scorer and best player. Overall Léo Júnior played for Brazil beach soccer between 1993 and 2001, notching up 201 goals during those years, including 71 goals at the World Championships. He stopped playing to pursue the development of the sport. In 2019, he was crowned &quot;Best Legend&quot; at the 2019 Beach Soccer Stars awards and the magazine France Football placed Júnior fifth in an article named &quot;10 Legends of Beach Soccer&quot;.

==Managerial career==
Léo Júnior coached Flamengo from 1993 to 1994, and in 1997. He coached Corinthians from 1 October 2003 to 10 October 2003.

==Style of play==
Léo Júnior was known for his technique and teamwork as well as his versatility, playing at left back and on the left side of midfield for Brazil due to his two footedness whilst often playing as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker at club level; he was also capable of playing on the right flank, and initially started out as an attacking right-back. He was as capable of &quot;orchestrating attacking moves as fulfilling his defensive remit.&quot; In addition to his playmaking skills, he was highly regarded for his elegance, leadership, and tactical intelligence, as well as his ability to get forward, provide precise crosses for his teammates, or strike on goal. Moreover, he was also an accurate free kick and penalty taker.

<doc id="615807" wikidata="Q178649" url="?curid=615807" title="Romário">
<text>Romário de Souza Faria (born 29 January 1966), known simply as Romário (), is a Brazilian politician and former professional footballer. A prolific striker renowned for his clinical finishing, he scored over 700 goals and is one of the few players to score at least 100 goals for three clubs. He is considered one of the greatest players of all time. Romário starred for Brazil in their 1994 FIFA World Cup triumph, receiving the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. He was named FIFA World Player of the Year the same year. He came fifth in the FIFA Player of the Century internet poll in 1999, was elected to the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players in 2004.

At club level, after developing his early career in Brazil, Romário moved to PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands in 1988. During his five seasons at PSV the club became Eredivisie champions three times, and he scored a total of 165 goals in 167 games. In 1993, he moved to Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;, forming an exceptional strike partnership with Hristo Stoichkov. He won La Liga in his first season and finished as the top goalscorer with 30 goals in 33 matches. During the second half of his career Romário played for clubs within the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. He won the Brazilian league title with Vasco da Gama in 2000 and was top scorer three times in the league. At the end of his career he also played briefly in Qatar, the United States and Australia.

Considered a master of the confined space of the penalty area, his rapid speed over short distances (aided by his low centre of gravity) took him away from defenders, and he was renowned for his trademark toe poke finish. With 55 goals in 70 appearances, Romário is the fourth-highest goalscorer for the Brazil national team, behind Neymar, Pelé and Ronaldo. He is third on the all-time list of Brazilian league&#x27;s top scorers with 155 goals. He is the ninth-highest goalscorer in the history of football with 784 goals in 1002 official games.

Romario started his political career in 2010, when he was elected deputy for the Brazilian Socialist Party. He was then elected senator in 2014. In 2017, he switched parties for Podemos, and in 2021, he joined the Liberal Party.

===Early years===
From humble origins, Romário was spotted in childhood when playing for Olaria, a small club from the Rio de Janeiro suburb. He was taken to the junior team of Vasco da Gama where he won two state league titles (1987, 1988) and earned his first call-ups to the national team. Romário came to international attention when he became the top scorer at the 1988 Olympic football tournament.

===1988–1993: PSV Eindhoven===

Shortly after the Olympics he moved to PSV Eindhoven, where he won the Eredivisie in 1989, 1991 and 1992. Renowned for his ability to operate in the confined space of the penalty box, Romário scored 165 goals in 167 games in five seasons at PSV.

Driven by an unswerving belief in his abilities, Romário&#x27;s laid back manner and overwhelming self-confidence would be displayed throughout his career, with Guus Hiddink, his coach at PSV, stating, &quot;If he saw that I was a bit more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he&#x27;d come to me and say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I&#x27;m going to score and we’re going to win&#x27;. What&#x27;s incredible is that eight out of the ten times he told me that, he really did score and we really did win.&quot;

===1993–1995: Barcelona===
Romário moved to Barcelona for the 1993–94 season and became part of Johan Cruyff&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;, in which, along with players such as strike partner Hristo Stoichkov, midfielders José Mari Bakero, and Michael Laudrup, and prolific goalscoring defender Ronald Koeman, he helped the club win the La Liga title, while becoming the season&#x27;s top goalscorer with 30 goals in 33 matches. Barcelona also reached the 1994 UEFA Champions League final, where in spite of being heavy favourites to win, they eventually lost 0–4 to Milan. The buildup to the final saw Spanish newspapers already declaring Barcelona as winners, while Cruyff told his team, &quot;You&#x27;re better than them, you&#x27;re going to win&quot;. With Romário and Stoichkov leading the Barcelona attack, Milan defender Paolo Maldini conceded his team were underdogs, but they were spurred on by what they perceived as arrogance from Barcelona.
One of Romário&#x27;s best performances was scoring a hat-trick in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in the &quot;El Clásico&quot; at the Camp Nou, with the spectacular opening goal seeing him drag the ball around the defender without it leaving his foot before finishing with a trademark toe-poke into the corner of the net. His highlight for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League came in the two games against Manchester United where he nutmegged Peter Schmeichel to score at Old Trafford, and scored again in the 4–0 win at the Camp Nou in front of 114,000 fans. Reflecting on the game at the Camp Nou, Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, who played in defence that night, states: &quot;Of all the great things that happened during my career, the thing that sticks out the most is that night because we got our backsides kicked big-style. Stoichkov and Romário are still etched in my memory, especially Romário, who was arguably the best player I ever faced.&quot;

Romário was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1994, after being the runner-up in 1993. Although he was lauded for his performances, Romário was prone to controversy, and in 1994 he landed a left hook to Sevilla&#x27;s Diego Simeone and was suspended for five games. Romário left Barcelona unexpectedly in January 1995 after having a rift with coach Cruyff.

===1995–1999: Flamengo and Valencia===
In 1995, Romário returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo and spent five years there excluding two short-lasting comebacks to Spain during that period. During a Copa Libertadores match against an Argentine team in 1995, Romário kicked an opposition defender on the chest in retaliation for a punch on his teammate Edmundo. He began the 1996–97 season with the Spanish club Valencia but after having heated arguments with then head coach Luis Aragonés he was soon loaned back to Flamengo.

Romário returned to Valencia at the beginning of 1997–98 season. With their new coach Claudio Ranieri claiming that he did not want to have any players staying at the club against their will, Romário, stating his need for good preparation for the World Cup in France, left Valencia for good after playing just six league matches in the season; once again he returned to Flamengo.

===2000–2005: Vasco and Fluminense===
Romário rejoined Vasco da Gama in 2000 and linked up again with fellow international striker Edmundo. Forming a prolific partnership, the two forwards led Vasco to the final of the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, with Romário finishing as joint-top goalscorer with three goals. The most notable performance from the pair was a 3–1 defeat of European champions Manchester United at the Estádio do Maracanã, where Romário scored twice in three first-half minutes and Edmundo added a third before half time. Having previously got on well together at Flamengo, the volatile Edmundo became jealous of Romário&#x27;s privileges, stating the club was &quot;a court, Romário the prince and [club chairman] Eurico Mirando [sic] the king&quot;. After Vasco&#x27;s victory a few days later, Romário replied: &quot;Now the court is happy: the king, the prince and the fool [Edmundo]&quot;.

At 34 years of age, Romário had one of the best seasons in his career while winning the Copa Mercosur and the Brazilian league title with Vasco. Romário&#x27;s performance was key in the Mercosur final where Vasco faced Brazilian rivals Palmeiras from São Paulo. After splitting the first two matches, a decisive third took place in São Paulo. Palmeiras took a 3–0 lead before half-time. In the second half however, Vasco scored four goals including Romário&#x27;s winner in the stoppage time, which completed his hat-trick. Romário received both the South American and Brazilian Footballer of the Year awards. He finished both the 2000 and 2001 seasons as the Brazilian league&#x27;s top goalscorer.

From 2002 until 2004, he played for Fluminense. In February 2003, Romário signed a lucrative three-month contract in Qatar with a club Al Sadd but after a disappointing stint without scoring a goal he returned to Fluminense. On 21 October 2004 he was fired from the club after a conflict with the coach. He also attacked a fan who had thrown six live chickens at him during training. Romário then went back once again to play for the team he started at, Vasco da Gama. In 2005, at 39 years of age, Romário scored 22 goals in the Brazilian Championship, making him the league&#x27;s top goalscorer for the third time.

===Later career===
In the beginning of 2006 Romário joined Miami FC along with former 1994 FIFA World Cup teammate Zinho. He helped Miami FC reach their first ever USL-1 Playoffs, scoring 19 league goals in 25 appearances for the team.

Newly promoted Campeonato Mineiro side Tupi announced a short-term deal with Romário to play for the Juiz de Fora team in the Taça Minas. However, the Brazilian Football Confederation prohibited the transfer, claiming the contract was signed after the closing of the international transfer window. Romário did not make his debut for the club, but took part in practice sessions.

Seen as a publicity coup of the A-League&#x27;s short history, Romário was signed by AUFC Board member Mel Patzwald to the Australian A-League club Adelaide United for a 5-game guest stint. He played his first match for Adelaide United on 25 November 2006 against the Central Coast Mariners. During his final game on 15 December 2006 he finally scored a goal for Adelaide to end what many considered to be a disappointing spell with the club. In January 2007 he signed a new deal with Vasco da Gama.

====Thousandth goal====
On 20 May 2007, Romário scored his 1000th goal, a penalty kick against Sport Recife, playing for Vasco da Gama. The Brazilian press claimed him as one of few players in professional football history to achieve this, like Pelé, Puskás, Friedenreich and Binder. The 1000th goal drew much attention from both Brazilian and international press, with the game being stopped for over 20 minutes to allow for celebrations from his fans. There is some controversy over the validity of the 1000 goals, because the number is somewhat inaccurate and Romário&#x27;s research team also counted his goals in junior, friendly and non-official games.

FIFA congratulated Romário on his milestone goal but stated he is still officially on 929 goals, as 77 came in youth football, with others being scored in unofficial friendly matches. RSSSF estimated his career tally to be 968 goals in 1188 games. In 2008, Romário released a DVD with the best goals of his career totaling 900 goals in the disc. Following the landmark goal, Vasco da Gama unveiled a statue of Romário at the São Januário.

====Player/Manager of Vasco da Gama====
On 24 October 2007, it was announced that Romário would take charge of his first match as the interim manager of Vasco against Club América of Mexico in the return leg of their Copa Sudamericana quarter final and he would also participate on the field as a player. Romário, then 41 years of age, replaced Celso Roth as the manager of Vasco da Gama, and also played the match against Club América at the same time. Vasco da Gama president Eurico Miranda declared to Globo Online that Romário would be in charge of the team for the match, but it is likely to only be temporarily. On 6 February 2008 Romário objected to Miranda&#x27;s intervention in team selection, so was dismissed, but remained contracted to Vasco as a player.

On 4 December 2007, Romário announced he had tested positive for finasteride (aka Propecia) after a match against Palmeiras on 28 October. He claims it was in an anti-baldness treatment; however, the drug was banned as it is a masking agent for anabolic steroids.

====Retirement and comeback====
On 5 February 2008, Romário announced his retirement both from playing and coaching, effective at the end of March. This move came somewhat unexpectedly, as fans anticipated that he would retire from playing, but not coaching. He made it clear that he will only concentrate on the FIFA Confederations Cup and helping with the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, on 27 March, Romário denied that he had retired.

Romário announced on 15 April 2008 at his DVD launch that he would retire from the game of football. He cited his weight as a major factor in his decision to retire from the game. Romário played for many clubs that spanned across five continents for over two decades. He scored 71 goals in 85 appearances for Brazil (including appearances and goals in the Olympics) and claimed to have scored over 1,000 club goals. Romário officially announced his retirement from playing, saying: Officially I&#x27;m not playing any more. I&#x27;ve stopped. My time is up. Everything has been a lot of fun.

In August 2009, Romário announced that he would come out of retirement to play for America from Rio de Janeiro. He stated that he would play for the club to fulfill his late father&#x27;s wishes. On 25 November 2009, Romário made his comeback. He came on during the 68th minute of the match between America and Artsul, replacing Adriano. Although he did not score, America won 2–0, which helped the club to win the Carioca Championship Second Division title.

In 2024, aged 58, Romário came out of retirement for a second time and was registered as a player-president for America in the 2024 Campeonato Carioca Série A2 to play alongside his son Romarinho. He was an unused substitute in the 2-0 against Petrópolis in the first round and stated that the initial plan is to be available only for the home matches.

==International career==

As a member of the Brazil national team, Romário won the silver Olympic medal in Seoul in 1988, finishing as the top-goalscorer with seven goals in six matches. He attained the status of national hero at the 1989 Copa América as he scored the only goal in the final against Uruguay to end Brazil&#x27;s long trophy drought in front of their own fans at the Maracanã. He was part of the Brazilian squad in the World Cups of 1990 and 1994. He scored 71 goals in 85 international matches (including senior and Olympic teams), being the fourth-highest goalscorer in the history of the Brazilian team.

===1990 World Cup===
Romário was one of the most talked about stars leading up to the 1990 World Cup in Italy, but picked up a serious injury three months before the big kick-off. Despite doing everything to recover in time and being rewarded with a spot in the squad, his lack of fitness meant he was restricted to playing only 66 minutes in one match, against Scotland. Brazil were eliminated in round of 16 by their rival side Argentina.

===1994 World Cup===

In 1992, during Romário&#x27;s successful season at PSV Eindhoven, he was called up to the national team for a friendly match against Germany on 16 December 1992 in Porto Alegre – Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira left Romário as a reserve, after which he expressed his dissatisfaction, saying he would not have come over from Netherlands if he had known he was not going to play. These declarations caused Parreira to ban Romário from the Brazilian team.

Brazil played the first seven matches of the 1994 World Cup qualification without Romário, and suffered their first loss ever in World Cup qualifying against Bolivia. His exclusion provoked a wave of outrage, with journalists and fans calling for his return to the team. Brazil had to beat or tie against Uruguay at the Maracanã Stadium to finish first of their group. Before the match against Uruguay, Parreira gave up and called Romário. Back in his beloved number 11 jersey, prior to the game Romário stated: &quot;I already know what is going to happen: I&#x27;m going to finish Uruguay&quot;. Brazil won 2–0, with Romário scoring both goals, and qualified for the World Cup. Parreira commented afterwards: &quot;God sent Romário to the Maracanã&quot;.
At the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, Romário partnered Bebeto in attack to lead his country to a record fourth World Cup title. Romário scored five goals in the tournament: one in each of the three first round matches, against Russia, Cameroon, and a trademark toe-poke finish against Sweden. He scored one against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals; and the game-winning header against Sweden in the semifinals.
Romário also assisted Bebeto in the only goal of the match against the United States in San Francisco for the round of 16 elimination match. Although he did not get on the scoresheet in the final in Los Angeles against Italy, a game played in searing heat which ended as a goalless draw, he converted Brazil&#x27;s second penalty in the shoot-out, which ended in a 3–2 win for Brazil. Romário won the World Cup Golden Ball as the most valuable player of the tournament, and was named in the World Cup All-Star Team.

Described by Jere Longman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;short on humility, long on talent&quot;, Romário demanded a window seat on the team plane and refused to sit next to Bebeto. He did however join Bebeto in one of the most iconic images of the tournament. After Bebeto scored against the Netherlands in Dallas, his goal celebration generated headlines around the world when he began rocking an imaginary baby – his wife had given birth to their third child just days before – with Romário (and Mazinho) then joining Bebeto in the rocking motion.

===The &quot;Ro-Ro&quot; attack===
In the subsequent years, Romário formed, along with fellow Brazilian forward Ronaldo, a feared attacking combo, which was colloquially referred to as the &quot;Ro-Ro&quot; duo. The first title which the strikers won while playing together in the front line, was the 1997 Copa América in Bolivia where they scored a total of eight goals. Later on in December 1997 they each scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 win against Australia in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup final. Romário finished the tournament as the top-goalscorer with seven goals while Ronaldo added four. In 1997 alone, the duo scored an impressive total of 34 international goals with 19 coming from Romário. The &quot;Ro-Ro&quot; attack was expected to headline the upcoming World Cup in France.

===1998 and 2002 World Cup absence===
Romário was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad. Medical exams had revealed that he had a muscular injury, and he received intensive treatment leading up to the tournament, but he did not recover completely and was dismissed the day of the deadline for the World Cup squad submissions. Just after the decision was announced, Romário held a press conference where he broke down in tears while saying that &quot;this is very sad for me, a big disappointment. This is a very difficult moment in my life&quot;. Brazil lost the World Cup final against hosts France.

Prior to the 2002 World Cup, Romário, aged 36, was in considerably good form while playing for Vasco da Gama, but once again he was left out of the national squad by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari due to indiscipline. The final incident happened when he pulled out of the Brazil squad for the 2001 Copa América in Colombia. He told Scolari that he was having an eye operation, but played friendlies for club side Vasco da Gama in Mexico and went on holiday instead. Romário gave a televised news conference in which he made his case and apologised, bursting into tears three times, though he said he could not remember doing or saying anything against the manager and the players. The BBC&#x27;s South American football correspondent, Tim Vickery, called Romário&#x27;s news conference &quot;bizarre&quot; and reported that there were &quot;increasingly credible rumours&quot; that &quot;senior players asked Scolari not to recall the veteran striker&quot;. Scolari was unmoved and did not pick him, saying before his squad announcement that Romário&#x27;s exclusion was &quot;technical and tactical&quot;. After the announcement, he said that it was as a result of Romário&#x27;s withdrawing from the Copa América: &quot;People forget the details, but I do not. I almost got fired from the national team after [the Copa América].&quot; (Brazil had been beaten in the quarter-finals by Honduras.) Without Romário, Brazil went on to win the World Cup for the fifth time.

===Last game for Brazil===

On 27 April 2005, Romário played his last game with the Brazil national team in a friendly and celebratory match in São Paulo. He wore the captain&#x27;s armband and scored the second goal in Brazil&#x27;s 3–0 win against Guatemala. Following the end of his playing career with Brazil, Romário successfully campaigned for Brazil to be awarded host status for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

==Footvolley and beach soccer==
Since the 1990s Romário has been a footvolley enthusiast, playing with friends in various tournaments. In 2006, he won the VIP Footvolley.net Open in Miami Beach, USA; and was runner-up in the 2011 Footvolley World Championship in Rio de Janeiro. He also plays Beach soccer and represented Brazil at the 2005 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.

==Style of play and recognition==
Romário is regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific strikers of all time. His coach at Barcelona, Johan Cruyff, defined him as a &quot;genius of the goal area&quot;, as well as the greatest player he ever coached. His Brazilian compatriot Ronaldo, who played with him in his early career, reflected, &quot;Romário was the most decisive player who I played with, he was a great goal scorer, finisher, skillful, opportunist. I think I learnt all of that from him&quot;. Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio said &quot;Romário is one of the greatest players of all time. He is a master of art in the penalty area,&quot; a view echoed by Paolo Maldini with, &quot;Romário was incredible in the penalty area.&quot; Diego Maradona on who was the best player he ever saw play, &quot;It is between Romário and Van Basten&quot;. Romário wore the number 11 shirt for most of his club and international career, which inspired Neymar&#x27;s number at Santos (he also went on to wear number 11 for Barcelona).

Along with two other FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Brazilian compatriot Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, Romário was seen as a new breed of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal, with former France striker Thierry Henry stating; &quot;Ronaldo, together with Romário and George Weah, reinvented the centre-forward position. They were the first to drop from the penalty box to pick up the ball in midfield, switch to the flanks, attract and disorientate the central defenders with their runs, their accelerations, their dribbling.&quot; Nicknamed &quot;Baixinho&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;The Little One,&quot; or &quot;Shorty&quot;) Romário was an extremely agile player, who possessed excellent balance on the ball, and significant strength in spite of his small stature, which made him particularly effective in tight spaces in the penalty area, and allowed him to retain possession of the ball when put under pressure by larger players; his low centre of gravity and quick bursts of acceleration enabled him to outrun opponents over short distances and beat defenders with sudden turns or changes of pace, while his technique and finishing ability saw him score a wide variety of numerous goals, including goals from powerful and accurate first-time strikes – notably through his trademark toe-pokes with little back-lift – or even from chipped shots. His ball control and dribbling skills saw him use elaborate feints, such as: dragging the ball around a defender without it leaving his foot, and the flip flap.

While he could operate outside the penalty area in making runs from deep, Romário built a reputation as an extremely opportunistic &quot;goal-poacher&quot; inside the penalty area. He was known for his intelligence, offensive movement, and positional sense, as well as his ability to find space in the area and lose his markers by making late runs. In addition to his goalscoring, he was also known for his speed, as well as his creativity and vision, which gave him the ability to link-up with and provide assists for teammates. This enabled him to form many notable attacking partnerships with other prolific, technically gifted forwards, such as Stoichkov (at Barcelona), Edmundo (at Vasco da Gama), Euller (Vasco da Gama) and Bebeto and Ronaldo (with Brazil). In spite of his talent, however, Romário was also criticised for being too outspoken, and for his poor work rate throughout his career, in particular for his vocal dislike of training. Regarding his work-rate and lifestyle off the pitch, Rodrigo Orihuela of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated in 2007: &quot;Romário has never been much of a committed athlete and has always had a rather laissez-faire approach to training. &#x27;The night was always my friend. When I go out, I am happy and when I am happy I score goals&#x27;, he once summarised.&quot;

==Media and sponsorship==
Romário has appeared in commercials for the sportswear company Nike. In 1998, he starred in a Nike commercial set in an airport with a number of stars from the Brazil national team, including Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos. Romário features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was included in the &quot;FIFA 14&quot; Ultimate Team Legends.

==Political career==

In the 2010 general election, Romário was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Socialist Party ticket. He was the sixth most voted candidate for deputy in Rio de Janeiro.

He pushed his political agenda against the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, denouncing the event as immersed in corruption and money laundering. He also expressed disagreement with Ricardo Teixeira, Jérôme Valcke, and Sepp Blatter. He is one of various figures claiming that the holding of the 2018 FIFA World Cup was &quot;stolen&quot; from England and sold to Russia as part of the 2011 scandal involving FIFA.

On 19 February 2014, Romário announced that he would run for the Brazilian senate in the 2014 general election, and the decision was officially confirmed in June. On 5 October, Romario was elected to the Senate with the most votes received ever by a candidate representing the state of Rio de Janeiro.

In June 2017, Romário left the PSB and joined Podemos, becoming president of the party in the State of Rio de Janeiro. In March 2018, Romário announced his run for governor of Rio de Janeiro in the Brazilian general election as a candidate for the centrist Podemos party. Romário finished in fourth place, with 8.6% of valid votes.

In April 2021, Romário switched parties again, to the Liberal Party. In October, he publicly endorsed the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, and criticised the previous administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

==Personal life==
Romario has been married and divorced three times and has seven children, including Romarinho who is a football.
Romarinho, also played for Vasco da Gama in Campeonato Brasileiro Série A.

<text>Djalma Pereira Dias dos Santos, known simply as Djalma Santos (; also spelled Dejalma Santos; 27 February 192923 July 2013) was a Brazilian footballer who starred for the Brazil national team in four World Cups and winning the 1958 and 1962 editions. Santos is considered to be one of the greatest right-backs of all time. While primarily known for his defensive skills, he often ventured upfield and displayed some impressive technical and attacking skills.

Along with Franz Beckenbauer and Philipp Lahm, he is one of only three players to be included into three FIFA World Cup All Star teams (in 1954, 1958 and 1962). He was unrelated to his frequent defensive partner Nilton Santos. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He is also one of the few footballers to have made over 1,000 professional appearances in his career.

Djalma Santos made history in the three big clubs he played for. Djalma was an idol at Palmeiras, where he played 498 games for nine years and won several titles, at Portuguesa, where he emerged in professional football and played 510 games, and at Atlético Paranaense, where he ended his career. Known as an exemplary player, he was never sent-off from the field.

== Club career ==
Djalma Santos started his career in his hometown with Portuguesa. He initially played in the centre of defence, but was later moved to the right side of defense. He was part of one of the best Portuguesa teams of all time, where alongside players like Pinga, Julinho Botelho and Brandãozinho he won the Rio-São Paulo Tournament in 1952 and 1955 and the Blue Ribbon in 1951 and 1953. He is the second largest record holder of games played by the club, 434 in total, between the years 1949 and 1958, second only to Capitão, with 496 games.

At Palmeiras, with 498 games, he is the seventh player who wore most the &quot;alviverde&quot; {Green and White} jersey. He was featured in the first academy alongside stars such as Ademir da Guia, Julinho Botelho, Djalma Dias and Vavá. It was at Palmeiras that he won the greatest number of titles of his career: the Paulista Championship in 1959, 1963 and 1966; the Brazilian Championships of 1960, 1967 (Robertão) and Brazil Cup of 1967. In addition, he won the Rio-São Paulo Tournament in 1965.

For Atlético Paranaense he played until the age of 42, another unusual brand for soccer players.

Despite having only defended three clubs in his career, Djalma Santos once wore the jersey of São Paulo, even though he belonged to Palmeiras at the time. On 9 November 1960, he played as an honor guest in the celebrations of the inauguration of the Morumbi Stadium, in the victory over Nacional do Uruguay, by 3–0, with goals from Canhoteiro and Gino.

== International career ==

Santos made 98 official appearances for Brazil between 1952 and 1968, and was in the squad for four consecutive World Cups between 1954 and 1966. He made his first appearance against Peru in the Panamerican Championship. The match was drawn 0–0. He also made two unofficial appearances for Brazil.

Along with Argentina&#x27;s Néstor Rossi, he was the only player to be unanimously voted into the 1957 South American Championship squad.

=== 1954 World Cup ===
Santos made his World Cup debut in a 5–0 win against Mexico, and played in all of Brazil&#x27;s matches during the tournament. He scored his first goal for Brazil from the penalty spot in a 4–2 defeat against Hungary (also known as the &quot;Battle of Berne&quot;).

=== 1958 World Cup ===
Santos had lost his place in the side after being dropped in favour of De Sordi, and did not play until the final against Sweden. Brazil won the match 5–2, with Santos being one of the outstanding performers. As a result, despite only playing one match in the tournament, he was included in the tournament&#x27;s All-Star Team.

=== 1962 World Cup ===
Santos was once again a regular in the starting lineup, playing in all of Brazil&#x27;s games. In the final against Czechoslovakia he set up the final goal for Brazil. Noting that the Slovak goalkeeper Viliam Schrojf was somewhat off his line, Santos lofted a long, massive, high arcing ball, into the goalmouth aided by the glare of the afternoon sun. Schrojf mishandled the cross, and Brazilian striker Vavá hammered the ball into goal.

=== 1966 World Cup ===
Santos, now at the age of 37, was selected for a fourth consecutive World Cup. The inclusion of Santos in the squad was a surprise to some, with Carlos Alberto expected to be selected instead. Santos played the first two games, but was dropped after the 3–1 defeat to Hungary. Brazil were knocked out of the tournament in the next game against Portugal.

== Style of play ==
After beginning his career in midfield, Santos found much success as a defender due to his composure, as well as his excellent and consistent displays in this position, and is regarded as one of the greatest right-backs of all time; he was also capable of playing as a centre back. Santos was a quick and physically strong defender, who was known for his stamina, marking, and tackling ability; he was also effective in the air. In addition to his defensive ability as a right-back, which earned him the nickname &quot;Muralha&quot; (the wall) from the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano, Santos was also known for his excellent technique and offensive capabilities, which saw him contribute to the development of the role; being gifted with excellent ball control, good dribbling skills, creativity, and accurate distribution, he often took on opponents with the ball when under pressure in one on one situations, even in risky situations inside his own penalty area, and he was also one of the first full-backs to venture forward and make overlapping attacking runs down the flank in order to contribute to his teams&#x27; offensive plays. Santos was also an accurate penalty kick and set-piece taker, and was known for his ability to take long throw-ins. In addition to his ability as a footballer, Santos was also known to be an extremely fair and correct player, as well as an exemplary professional, who stood out for his work-rate, longevity, discipline in training, and correct behaviour; throughout his entire, extensive career, he was never once sent off.

== Death ==
Santos died on 23 July 2013 in hospital in Uberaba, where he had lived for two decades. He died due to pneumonia and severe hemodynamic instability, culminating with cardiac arrest, having been hospitalized since 1 July 2013.

<doc id="615810" wikidata="Q47526" url="?curid=615810" title="Zico (footballer)">
<text>Arthur Antunes Coimbra (, born 3 March 1953), better known as Zico (), is a Brazilian football coach and former player who played as an attacking midfielder. Often called the &quot;White Pelé&quot;, he was a creative playmaker, with excellent technical skills, vision and an eye for goal, who is considered one of the most clinical finishers and best passers ever, as well as one of the greatest players of all time. Arguably the world&#x27;s best player of the late 1970s and early 80s, he is regarded as one of the best playmakers and free kick specialists in history, able to bend the ball in all directions. By one estimate, Zico is the player that scored the most goals from direct free kicks, with 101 goals.

In 1999, Zico came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. As stated by Pelé himself, considered one of the greatest players of all time, &quot;throughout the years, the one player that came closest to me was Zico&quot;. He was chosen as the 1981 and 1983 Player of the Year.

With 48 goals in 71 official appearances for Brazil, Zico is the fifth highest goalscorer for his national team. He represented Brazil in the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups. They did not win any of those tournaments, even though the 1982 squad is considered one of the greatest Brazilian national squads ever. He is widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian never to win the World Cup.

Zico has coached the Japan national team, appearing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and winning the 2004 Asian Cup, and Fenerbahçe, who were a quarter-finalist in 2007–08 in the Champions League under his command. He has also coached CSKA Moscow, Olympiacos, and the Iraq national team. He works as technical director at Kashima Antlers.

== Early years ==

Born in 1953, Zico came from a lower-middle-class family of Portuguese origin, in the neighbourhood of Quintino Bocaiuva, Rio de Janeiro. In common with many young Brazilians, he spent much of his youth dreaming of being a professional footballer and skipped school to play football on the streets. His passion for the sport made him famous in the neighbourhood, where people would gather to see the boy&#x27;s brilliant performances against older children and teenagers. At that time he was playing for &quot;Juventude&quot;, a local futsal street team run by his older brothers and friends, and had also begun to play for futsal club &quot;River Futebol Clube&quot; on Sundays.

His nickname originated in Zico&#x27;s own family from increasingly shortened versions of &quot;Arthurzinho&quot; (&quot;Little Arthur&quot;) which then became &quot;Arthurzico&quot;, then &quot;Tuzico&quot; and, finally, &quot;Zico&quot;, a version created by his cousin Ermelinda &quot;Linda&quot; Rolim.

In 1967, at 14 years old, he had a scheduled trial at América, where his brothers Antunes and Edu were professional players. But on a Sunday, during a River match, Zico scored nine goals and caught the attention of radio reporter Celso Garcia, who asked Zico&#x27;s father to take him to a trial at Flamengo instead. Being a Flamengo fan, Zico had his father&#x27;s approval, and so began his path towards becoming one of the most admired players in the history of the sport.

== Youth career ==
Zico was not physically strong, and his story of determination and discipline began with a tough muscle and body development program conducted by physical education teacher José Roberto Francalacci. A combination of hard work and also a special diet sponsored by his team enabled Zico to develop a strong body and become an athlete; this later proved to be essential for his success.

During 1971 and 1972, he shifted from youth to professional team and back. Coach Fleitas Solich had confidence in Zico&#x27;s abilities and promoted him, on the other hand the situation changed when the Paraguayan coach left and Zagallo took over. He believed Zico to be too young and sent him back to the youth team. Things only improved for Zico when Joubert, his first coach at the youth team, was appointed the new coach for the seniors and fully promoted him after 116 matches and 81 goals in the youth team.

== Club career ==
=== Flamengo (1971–1983) ===

While at Flamengo, Zico was a key player during the most glorious period of the team&#x27;s history. Along with many other titles, in his first period at Flamengo he led the team to victory in the 1981 Copa Libertadores, the 1981 Intercontinental Cup and four national titles (1980, 1982, 1983 and 1987). On the field, Zico made goals in all imaginable ways, was also a great assister and team organiser and was known for his excellent vision of the field. He was a two-footed player and an expert at free kicks.

=== Udinese (1983–1985) ===
After receiving offers from A.S. Roma and A.C. Milan, moving to Italy seemed right and a four-million dollar proposal from Udinese was on the table. Such an amount of money made bigger clubs pressure the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) that blocked the transfer expecting financial guarantees. This caused a commotion in Udine as enraged Friulians flocked to the streets in protest against the Italian federation and the federal government. Historical reasons would make them shout &quot;O Zico, o Austria!&quot; (&quot;Either Zico or Austria&quot;). At the end of the controversy, the deal went through and though leaving Flamengo fans in sadness, Zico made the Friulians fans finally dream of better days.

In the 1983–84 Serie A, his first in Italy, his partnership with Franco Causio promised to take Udinese to a higher level, gaining respect from giants Juventus and Roma. His free kicks caused such an impact that TV sports programs would debate how to stop them. Despite his excellent performance, the club&#x27;s season ended in disappointment as Udinese, in spite of scoring almost twice as many goals as the previous year, only gathered 32 points and was ninth in the final standing, losing three places in comparison to 1982–83. Zico scored 19 goals, one fewer than top scorer Michel Platini, having played 4 fewer matches than the French footballer due to an injury. Plus, he was voted 1983 Player of the Year by &quot;World Soccer Magazine&quot;.

His following season would be punctuated by injuries and suspensions for openly attacking referees. He also used to complain about the board&#x27;s lack of ambition for not signing competitive players, which made the team too dependent on him. Furthermore, Italian tax officials pressed charges against him for tax evasion. Pressured, Zico delivered an amazing display against Diego Maradona&#x27;s Napoli, his last match as a &quot;bianconero&quot;, and returned to Brazil and Flamengo, sponsored by a group of companies.

He became a fan favorite with his spectacular goals and is still adored now by all Udinese fans.

=== Back to Flamengo (1985–1989) ===
Only one month after returning, he suffered a severe knee injury after a violent tackle from Bangu&#x27;s defender Marcio Nunes, which interrupted his career for several months, even affecting his form in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Recovered from injuries, things improved for Zico in 1987 when he led Flamengo to the Copa União title.

December 1989 marks Zico&#x27;s last official appearance for Flamengo in a Brazilian National Championship match against rivals Fluminense. Zico scored the first goal and Flamengo won the match 5–0.

Two months later, at Maracanã, he would play his last match ever as a Flamengo player facing a World Cup Masters team composed of names like Eric Gerets, Claudio Gentile, Franco Causio, Alberto Tarantini, Jorge Valdano, Mario Kempes, Paul Breitner, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Falcão.
With 731 matches for Flamengo, Zico is the player with the 2nd most appearances for the club. His 508 goals make him the club&#x27;s top scorer ever.

The achievements of the greatest idol in Flamengo&#x27;s history inspired the Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor to write a song in his honour – &quot;Camisa 10 da Gávea&quot; – helping create the mystique of the club&#x27;s number 10.

=== Brief retirement ===
Zico represented Brazil in the World Cup of Masters, scoring in the final of the 1990 and 1991 editions.

After Brazil&#x27;s first presidential election in many years, the new president Fernando Collor de Mello appointed Zico as his Minister of Sports. Zico stayed at this political assignment for about a year and his most important contribution was a piece of legislation dealing with the business side of sport teams.

=== Kashima Antlers (1991–1994) ===
In 1991, Zico interrupted his political assignment when he accepted an offer to join the Sumitomo Metals in Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture, at the time in the second tier, to help the club secure a place in Japan&#x27;s first fully professional football league that was set to officially launch in 1993 – J1 League. Zico played for Sumitomo in 1991–92, the last season before the old Japan Soccer League was disbanded, and finished as the second division&#x27;s top scorer. When the new league launched, In the opening match of the J.League he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win over Nagoya Grampus. The small town club, promoted and rebranded Kashima Antlers, was not expected to compete with richer, more glamorous clubs like Yokohama Marinos and Verdy Kawasaki. Zico, however, helped the Antlers to win the J.League Suntory Series and a runners-up finish in its inaugural season, leading the club to cement its place among the league&#x27;s elite. On 15 June 1994, he scored the final goal of his career in a 2–1 win over Júbilo Iwata.

His discipline, talent and professionalism meshed very well with Japanese culture and his influence earned him the nickname from Japanese football fans. He became a local legend in Japan for having built a contender from almost nothing and putting the city of Kashima on the map. A statue in his honor stands outside Kashima Soccer Stadium.

== International career ==
An episode related to Brazil national football team almost made Zico give up on his career. He made his international debut in the South American qualifier to the 1972 Summer Olympics tournament playing 5 matches and scoring the qualifying goal against Argentina. Despite this fact, he wasn&#x27;t called up to the Munich games. He felt extremely frustrated and told his father in dismay he wanted to stop playing football. He was even absent from training at Flamengo for 10 days, being later convinced otherwise by his brothers.

In the opening group match of the 1978 World Cup against Sweden, Zico headed a corner kick into the goal in the final minute of the match, apparently breaking a 1–1 tie. However, in a call that became infamous, the Welsh referee Clive Thomas disallowed the goal, saying that he had blown the whistle to end the match while the ball was still in the air from a corner. In the second round, he scored from a penalty in a 3–0 win over Peru. Zico eventually won a bronze medal with Brazil at the tournament, defeating Italy in the 3rd place final.

Zico also won another bronze medal with Brazil in the 1979 Copa América, where he scored two goals.

The 1982 World Cup would see Zico as part of a fantastic squad, side by side with Falcão, Sócrates, Éder, Cerezo and Júnior. In spite of his 4 goals and the great amount of skill in that squad (Zico was involved in eight consecutive goals scored by Brazil), the team was defeated 3–2 by Paolo Rossi and Italy in the final match of the second round group stage.

He played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup while still injured and only appeared as a second-half substitute throughout the tournament; in the quarter-final match against France during regulation time, he helped Brazil win a penalty, but then missed his kick. The match ended in a tie which led to a shootout. Zico then scored his goal, but penalties missed by Sócrates and Júlio César saw Brazil knocked out of the tournament.

Having been cleared of all the tax evasion charges by Italian officials in 1988, Zico decided to pay a tribute to Udine, the city that had madly welcomed him six years before, and played his farewell match for the &quot;Seleção&quot; in March 1989 losing 1–2 to a World All-Stars team at Stadio Friuli.

== Style of play ==
A classic number 10, Zico usually played as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in several other attacking and midfield positions, and was also deployed as a central midfielder, as a second striker or inside forward, or even as an outside forward; he is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. A diminutive playmaker, with a small, slender physique, although he was naturally right-footed, he was essentially a two-footed player, who was known for his flair, speed, exceptional technique, ball control and dribbling skills, as well as his use of tricks and feints to beat opponents with the ball. Former Dutch international Ruud Gullit rated Zico as &quot;one of the best dribblers in the history of the game&quot;, describing him as &quot;very nimble&quot;. Although he was not physically imposing, Zico was a quick, complete and highly creative player, with excellent vision, who is considered to be one of the best passers of all time and was known for his trademark no-look passes. In addition to being an elite creator of goalscoring opportunities, Zico was also a prolific goalscorer himself and an excellent finisher, due to his powerful and accurate striking ability, which made him extremely clinical in front of goal; as such he is also regarded by pundits as one of the greatest goalscorers in the history of the game.

He was also a set-piece specialist, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball and score from dead ball situations and is considered to be one of the greatest free-kick takers of all time. Zico&#x27;s unique free kick technique, which saw him place significant importance on his standing foot, often saw him lean back and raise his knee at a very high angle when hitting the ball with his instep, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, before it dropped back down again; his method of striking the ball allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even from just outside the penalty area. Moreover, due to his technique, mentality, unpredictability and accuracy in dead ball situations, he was capable of placing the ball in either top or bottom corner on either side of the goal, which made it difficult for goalkeepers to read his free kicks. His ability from set-pieces inspired several other specialists, such as Roberto Baggio and Andrea Pirlo.

In addition to his footballing skills, Zico was also known for his leadership, mental strength and determination, as well as his stamina, dedication and for having an outstanding work-ethic; indeed, he was often known for staying behind in training to practice and refine his free kicks. Throughout his career, Zico was nicknamed &quot;O Galinho&quot; (&quot;The Little Rooster&quot;, in Portuguese).

Despite his ability, his career was plagued by injuries.

== Retirement ==
Zico retired from professional football during the 1994 season but received an invitation to play beach soccer, winning the Beach Soccer World Cup 1995. Scoring 12 goals, he was the top scorer and was named the best player of the tournament. He returned to Kashima to become the Antlers&#x27; technical adviser in 1995, splitting his time between Japan and Brazil – where he still managed to find time to play beach soccer. One year later, in 1996, he won his second Beach Soccer World Cup with Brazil, scoring in the final against Uruguay. He founded CFZ (Zico Football Centre) in Rio de Janeiro. Zico founded another club, named CFZ de Brasília, in 1999.

== Coaching career ==
=== Japan ===
After the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Japan Football Association looked for a replacement for the outgoing Philippe Troussier, and chose Zico as his successor. Despite his lack of coaching experience besides his stint as Brazil&#x27;s technical coordinator during the 1998 World Cup, Zico had great understanding of Japanese soccer from his playing days and his role as Kashima&#x27;s technical director. In addition, JFA had grown tired of Troussier&#x27;s clashes with the media while the players were frustrated with his micromanagement. In contrast, Zico commanded respect from reporters and urged players to express themselves on the pitch.

Although Zico attempted to instill a free-flowing, attacking mentality to the team, his regime got off to an uneven start, which included a 4–1 loss to Argentina in 2003. Japan had a respectable showing at that year&#x27;s Confederations Cup but struggled again in the beginning of 2004, only narrowly beating Oman in the first stage of qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and several players were suspended after a drinking incident. Although Japan had not lost in its nine previous matches, he was rumored to be on the verge of resigning and a small group of fans marched in the streets of Tokyo demanding his firing.

He stayed on, however, and won the 2004 Asian Cup despite intimidation from Chinese fans and a team that featured just one European-based player, Shunsuke Nakamura. He then helped Japan qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with just one loss.

Despite the rocky start, injuries to key players and even a bizarre offer from Garforth Town, Zico led Japan to its third World Cup finals appearance and the third Asian Cup title in four tries. His Japanese team was heavily influenced by Brazil&#x27;s short passing style and he was flexible enough to switch between 4–4–2 and 3–5–2 formations. In addition, he has had a respectable record on European soil, beating Czech Republic and Greece and drawing with England, Brazil and Germany.

However, Japan failed to win a single match at the Finals, losing twice (to Australia and Brazil) and drawing once (to Croatia), and scoring just two goals while conceding seven. He resigned from Japan at the end of the World Cup campaign.

=== Fenerbahçe ===
In July 2006, signed a two-year deal with Fenerbahçe. He won the league title in 2007 and won Turkish Super Cup on the first year of his job. Under his command Fenerbahçe qualified to the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League knockout stage for the first time in club history, where they beat Sevilla on penalties to advance to the quarter-finals. Fenerbahce beat Chelsea 2–1 in the first leg, but Chelsea won 2–0 at Stamford Bridge to eliminate Fenerbahce. This was Fenerbahce&#x27;s best performance in UEFA competitions.

Zico was given a new nickname by Fenerbahçe fans: &quot;Kral Arthur&quot; (meaning &quot;King Arthur&quot; in Turkish). For the team&#x27;s nickname &quot;King Arthur and his Knights&quot;. On 10 June 2008, he resigned as Fenerbahçe manager after failing to agree on contract terms.

On 8 September 2008, Zico revealed that he would be interested taking over the vacant managers position at Newcastle United following the resignation of Kevin Keegan. He is quoted saying &quot;The Newcastle job is one that I would be very interested in taking. It would be a privilege and an honour, I&#x27;ve always wanted to experience the Premier League as I believe I could enjoy much success coaching in England.&quot;

=== Bunyodkor, CSKA Moscow and Olympiakos ===

In 2008, he coached FC Bunyodkor in Uzbekistan, where he won the Uzbekistani Cup and the Uzbek League. He subsequently took over at Russian side CSKA Moscow but was fired on 10 September 2009.

Less than a week later Zico signed a 2-year contract with Olympiacos. Despite the absence of numerous first-team players due to injuries, he led the Greek club to a comfortable 2nd place in Group H of the Champions League, earning the qualification to the knockout stage. In the Greek Superleague his first results were also impressive, but the success lasted only till early winter and the fans started to complain about both the results and the playing style of the team after a Greek cup elimination at the hands of second division side Panserraikos. On 19 January 2010, after a 0-0 draw against Kavala, Zico was sacked, although his team lost only two times (twelve wins and four draws) in the Greek Superleague.

=== Iraq ===
He signed a contract with Iraq Football Federation on 28 August 2011 and first managed the national team in a match against Jordan on 2 September 2011. Zico resigned as coach of the Iraqi national team on 27 November 2012 after little more than a year in the post, saying the country&#x27;s football association had failed to fulfill the terms of his contract. He had ten wins, six draws, and five losses in 21 games with Iraq.

=== Al-Gharafa ===
On 6 August 2013, he signed a two-year deal to coach Al-Gharafa of Qatar.
=== FC Goa ===
Indian Super League side FC Goa signed Zico as their coach for the debut season in 2014. Though Goa had a slow start to the season, they ultimately qualified for the semifinals with a game in hand by defeating Chennaiyin FC. In 2015 FC Goa did really well to reach the final. Eventually Goa lost 3–2 to Chennaiyin FC. Zico has been regarded as Goa&#x27;s new legend among the local fan base. In January 2017, FC Goa confirmed ending their three-year association with Zico. Keeping the logistical challenges of the upcoming season in mind, the two parties amicably came to this decision.

== Administrative roles ==
Zico was a director at Kashima Antlers between 1996 and 2002.

On 30 May 2010, it was announced that Zico would become the new Flamengo football director on a four-year deal, coming back to the team where he won his most important honors after 25 years. This comeback, however, lasted only five months as he resigned due to disagreements with the board.

On 10 June 2015, Zico officially announced he would run for the FIFA presidency role after the recent announcement of Sepp Blatter&#x27;s resignation following the alleged corruption surrounding the winning bids from Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.

In August 2018, Zico returned to Kashima Antlers as technical director, 16 years after his previous spell as a director at the club.

== Personal life ==
Zico is the grandson of Fernando Antunes Coimbra (paternal grandfather) and Arthur Ferreira da Costa Silva (maternal grandfather), both Portuguese. His father, José Antunes Coimbra, also Portuguese (b. Tondela, 1901; d. Rio de Janeiro, 1986), came to Brazil aged 10. Zico&#x27;s mother, Matilde Ferreira da Silva Costa, was born in 1919 but died 16 years after her husband in 2002. Because of his origins, he also holds Portuguese citizenship in addition to his Brazilian one.

Zico was the youngest of six children—Maria José (Zezé), Antunes, Nando, Edu and Antônio (Tonico).

In 1969 Zico met his future wife, Sandra Carvalho de Sá. In 1970 the couple became engaged and married in 1975. Sandra&#x27;s sister, Sueli, is Edu&#x27;s wife. Zico has three sons, Arthur Jr., Bruno and Thiago. Zico is also a member of the legendary squad &quot;Classic Eleven&quot; from the FIFA video games series. Zico is Roman Catholic. He is a distant relative of the Portuguese footballer Eduardo Quaresma.

<text>Julio César Romero Insfrán (born 28 August 1960), also known as Romerito, is a Paraguayan former professional footballer who played as a midfielder, considered among the greatest players in Paraguayan football history. He is the only Paraguayan named by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 in March 2004.

==Career==
Born in Luque, Paraguay, Romero started his career at local club Sportivo Luqueño in 1977, by 1979 Romero&#x27;s consistent performances had earned him a place in the Paraguay national team that played in the FIFA World Youth Championship and was considered one of the best players of the tournament along with Diego Maradona. In the same year, Romero played a key role in Paraguay&#x27;s win in the Copa América, scoring three goals.

In 1980, he joined now defunct New York Cosmos where he played alongside such greats as the Brazilian and German World Cup winning captains of 1970 and 1974 Carlos Alberto and Franz Beckenbauer. In the 1980 Soccer Bowl he scored the game-winning goal of a 3–0 victory over Ft. Lauderdale.

Romero moved to Brazil to play for Fluminense where he was selected as the South American Footballer of the Year in 1985. He became a fan favorite after leading the team to a Campeonato Brasileiro.

In 1986, he was a key player in helping the Paraguay national team return to the FIFA World Cup finals after a 28-year hiatus. At the finals in Mexico, he scored against Iraq and the host nation in the first round.

After a short spell with FC Barcelona in Spain and a stint in Mexico with Puebla F.C. Romero returned to South America where he played out his career with Olimpia, Club Cerro Corá and Sportivo Luqueño in Paraguay and Deportes La Serena in Chile.

During his career, he scored a little more than 400 goals.

<text>The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (French: &quot;Tombe du Soldat Inconnu&quot;) is a tomb situated before the National War Memorial in Confederation Square, Ottawa, Ontario. The tomb is dedicated to Canadian service members, and holds the remains of an unidentified Canadian soldier who died in France during the First World War; selected from a Commonwealth War Grave near Vimy, in the vicinity where the Battle of Vimy Ridge took place. A similar memorial was installed in June of 2024 at the National War Memorial in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to contain the unidentified Great War remains of a soldier of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.

A tomb with an unidentified soldier was added to the National War Memorial in 2000, the culmination of a project begun by the Royal Canadian Legion. Since 2007, the Canadian Armed Forces have posted sentries at the tomb, and the National War Memorial, from April to November.

==Unknown soldier==
At the request of the Royal Canadian Legion, the Canadian government became part of the project of creating a tomb of the unknown soldier for Canada, as part of the Canada Millennium Partnership Program. The Cabinet asked the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to select one of the 1,603 graves of unknown Canadians buried in the vicinity of Vimy Ridge. Chosen was Grave 7, in Row E of Plot 8 of the Cabaret-Rouge British Cemetery in Souchez, France, near the memorial at Vimy Ridge, the site of the first major battle where all four Canadian divisions fought together as a combined force. The remains of the soldier buried there were exhumed on the morning of May 16, 2000, and the coffin was flown in a Canadian Forces aircraft to Ottawa on May 25, accompanied by a 45-person guard of honour, a chaplain, Royal Canadian Legion veterans, and two representatives of Canadian youth. In Ottawa, the unknown soldier lay in state for three days in the Hall of Honour in the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

On the afternoon of May 28, the body of the unknown soldier was transported to the National War Memorial on a horse-drawn Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) gun carriage. Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, her husband, and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, as well as veterans, Canadian Forces personnel, and members of the RCMP, were in the funeral cortege. Then, with full military honours before a crowd of 20,000, the body, in a silver maple casket, was re-interred in a sarcophagus in front of the war memorial. Legionnaires placed a handful of soil from each of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories, as well as from the soldier&#x27;s former grave site, on the casket before the tomb was sealed.

The original headstone of the unknown soldier is the sole artifact and the focal point of the Memorial Hall exhibit within the Canadian War Museum. The hall was designed in such a way that sunlight will only frame the headstone once each year on the 11th of November at 11:00 am. At the former burial site of the unknown soldier, a grave marker similar to the other headstones in the Cabaret-Rouge Cemetery was placed at the now-empty grave. It is inscribed with these words:

==Tomb==

The tomb is intended to honour the approximately 116,000 Canadians who died in combat, as well as all members of the Canadian Armed Forces—in all branches—who died or may die in all conflicts, past, present, and future. It is long, wide, and high and built of Caledonia granite, originally quarried in Rivière-à-Pierre, Quebec, with a bronze relief sculpture and four bronze corner pieces. The granite was selected for its colour—matching that of the war memorial. The bronze work—showing a medieval sword, a First World War helmet, and branches of maple and laurel leaves (symbolizing both victory and death)—was designed by Canadian artist Mary-Ann Liu and cast in Roberts Creek, British Columbia. Three of the corner pieces show the different variants of the Memorial Cross during the reigns of three Canadian monarchs since the cross&#x27; inception—George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II—while the fourth is a poppy.

The design, chosen by a committee from six submissions by Canadian artists, reflects some of the themes and style of the Vimy Memorial, designed by Walter Seymour Allward. The site is maintained by Public Works and Government Services Canada.

The tomb has become a focal point at all commemorative events at the National War Memorial. At the first Remembrance Day following the tomb&#x27;s installation, what became a tradition started spontaneously as attendees placed their poppies on the tomb. This act expanded to include the leaving of cut flowers, photographs, or letters to the deceased. The spontaneous display of respect has also carried over to Canada Day when the public leaves small, paper national flags on the tomb.

The Royal Canadian Legion commissioned in 2001 a small work of art on the theme of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by André Gauthier.

==Sentries==
Since 2007, a pair of sentries from the Ceremonial Guard, in full dress uniform and with unloaded weapons, have been stationed at the tomb, on rotation from 9 am to 5 pm. Originally, the programme ran only through July and August. This was expanded in 2014 to run from April 9 (the date of the start of the Battle of Vimy Ridge) to November 10, as well as during significant military anniversaries throughout the rest of the year.

Each morning, the first sentries are marched out with a duty piper and, upon taking their posts, are read their orders by the posting non-commissioned officer: both are ordered arms and to stand at ease, weapon thrust out to the full extent of the right arm, head up, and feet 30 inches apart. Sentries hold their post for one hour before being replaced, though, a sentry may stand for two shifts in a day. Sentries on duty may march their beat, which consists of the senior sentry giving a sharp tap on the ground with his or her rifle butt, then acknowledged by the other sentry with a tap of his or her own rifle. A two-three pause between each movement, both sentries then come to attention, take a pace forward, shoulder their rifles, turn outwards, and start marching their beat of nine paces. At the ninth pace, both execute an about-turn and return to their original position, if a halt is signalled. Marching the beat can continue for the full hour if desired. Sentries may not interact with the public.

As the Ceremonial Guard is drawn from all branches of the Canadian Forces (the units chosen via an established rotation), the sentries, too, can be members of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, or Royal Canadian Air Force, as well as the Special Operations Command. The commanding officer of each unit decides who will be sent to Ottawa. Occasionally, members of a police force will act as sentries at the tomb, such as when officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did so on July 5, 2013, to honour Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the North-West Mounted Police, who earned the Victoria Cross serving with Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse during the Second Boer War.

==Incidents==
===2006 urination incident===
The Royal Canadian Legion leadership opined that the tomb deserved a military or police guard as a symbol of respect and to protect it from vandalism and desecration. These demands were brought into focus on the night of July 1, 2006, when Dr. Michael Pilon, a retired Canadian Forces major, photographed three young men urinating on the war memorial shortly after the annual Canada Day fireworks show over nearby Parliament Hill. In the summer of 2007, the sentry programme was instituted.

===2014 shootings at Parliament Hill===

On October 22, 2014, a man armed with a rifle shot at the sentries on duty at the tomb, fatally wounding Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#x27;s), before proceeding across the street and into the Centre Block on nearby Parliament Hill. There, the shooter engaged in a firefight with Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons Kevin Vickers and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which ended when he was killed by RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett.

===2022 convoy protests===
On the weekend of January 29, 2022, individuals participating in the Canada convoy protest against COVID-19 mandates danced on the statue, on the tomb, and parked vehicles on the surrounding grounds. The incident was criticized by military officials, politicians, and the Private Motor Truck Council of Canada.

<text>A fiberscope is a flexible optical fiber bundle with a lens on one end and an eyepiece or camera on the other. It is used to examine and inspect small, difficult-to-reach places such as the insides of machines, locks, and the human body.

== History ==
Guiding of light by refraction, the principle that makes fiber optics possible, was first demonstrated by Daniel Colladon and Jacques Babinet in Paris in the early 1840s. Then in 1930, Heinrich Lamm, a German medical student, became the first person to put together a bundle of optical fibers to carry an image. These discoveries led to the invention of endoscopes and fiberscopes.
In the 1960s the endoscope was upgraded with glass fiber, a flexible material that allowed light to transmit, even when bent. While this provided users with the capability of real-time observation, it did not provide them with the ability to take photographs. In 1964 the fiberscope, the first gastro camera, was invented. It was the first time an endoscope had a camera that could take pictures. This innovation led to more careful observations, and more accurate diagnoses.

==Optics==
Fiberscopes work by utilizing the science of fiber-optic bundles, which consist of numerous fiber-optic cables. Fiber-optic cables are made of optically pure glass and are as thin as a human’s hair. The three main components of a fiber-optic cable are:
*core – the center made of high purity glass
*cladding – the outer material surrounding the core that prevents light from leaking
*buffer coating – the protective plastic coating
The following are the two different types of fiber-optic bundles in a fiberscope: 
*illumination bundle – designed to carry light to the area in front of the lens
*imaging bundle – designed to carry an image from the lens to the eyepiece 

===Total internal reflection===
Fiber-optic cables use total internal reflection to carry information. When light travels from one medium to another it is refracted. If the light is traveling from a less dense medium to a dense medium it is refracted away from the normal. The opposite applies if the light is traveling from a dense medium to a less dense medium. In optic cables, light travels through the dense glass core (high refractive index) by constantly reflecting from the less dense cladding (lower refractive index). This happens because the surface of the core acts like a perfect mirror and the angle of the light is always larger than the critical angle.

==Components==
*Eyepiece – Magnifies the image carried back by the imaging bundle so the human eye can view it.
*Imaging bundle – Continuous strand of flexible glass fibers that transmit the image to the eyepiece.
*Distal lens – The combination of micro lenses that take images and focus them into the small imaging bundle.
*Illumination system – A fiber optic light guide that relays light from the source to the target area
*Articulation system – The ability of the user to control the movement of the bending section of the fiberscope that is directly attached to the distal lens.
*Fiberscope body – The control section that is designed to help aide one hand operation.
*Insertion tube – Most of the length of the fiberscope, made to be durable and flexible. This protects the optical fiber bundle and the articulation cables.
*Bending section – The most flexible part of the fiberscope, it connects the insertion tube to the distal viewing section.
*Distal section – Where the ending points of both the illumination and imaging fiber bundle are.

== Medical applications ==
Fiberscopes are used in the medical field as a tool to help doctors and surgeons examine problems in a patient’s body without having to make large incisions. This procedure is called an endoscopy. Doctors use this when they suspect that a patient’s organ is infected, damaged, or cancerous. There are numerous types based on the area of the body being examined. They include:
*Arthroscopy – Joints
*Bronchoscopy – Lungs
*Colonoscopy – Colon
*Cystoscopy – Bladder
*Enteroscopy – Small Intestine
*Hysteroscopy – Uterus
*Laparoscopy – Abdomen/Pelvis
*Laryngoscopy – Larynx (voice box)
*Mediastinoscopy – Area between lungs
*Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy – Esophagus and upper intestinal tract

Although any medical technique has its potential risks, using a fiberscope for endoscopy has a very low risk of causing infection and blood loss.

==Other applications==
Locksmiths use fiberscopes to check the position of pins. Technicians and inspectors use fiberscopes to look at the inside of machines without having to disassemble them. Fiberscopes can also be used in a military or police application to check beneath doors or around corners, or otherwise perform surveillance or reconnaissance.

==In popular media==
* The 1982 film &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, about the Special Air Service, depicted the use of fiberscopes in counterterrorism.
* Fiberscopes are an important tool in tactical shooter video games such as &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;SWAT&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, and &quot;Door Kickers&quot;, where they are used to check under doors or around corners without revealing the player&#x27;s position or exposing them to enemy attack.

<doc id="615815" wikidata="Q311403" url="?curid=615815" title="Teófilo Cubillas">
<text>Teófilo Juan Cubillas Arizaga (; born 8 March 1949) is a Peruvian former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He is considered as Peru&#x27;s greatest ever player and one of the best in history of South America. In an IFFHS poll he was selected as the best Peruvian player in history and was also included in the world&#x27;s Top 50 of the 20th century. At the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Pelé acknowledged Cubillas, referring to him as his successor. Cubillas was renowned for his technique, shooting ability and free kick ability. 

Beginning at Alianza Lima, he was nicknamed &quot;El Nene&quot; &quot;(The Kid)&quot;, and was part of the Peru national team that won the 1975 Copa América. He helped Peru reach the quarter finals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup and again at the 1978 World Cup, along with qualifying for the 1982 World Cup. He was elected the South American Footballer of the Year in 1972. At a club level, he is the second all time highest goalscorer of Alianza Lima with 165 and the top goalscorer of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers with 65. For the national team, he is the third all time goalscorer with 28 goals in 81 appearances. He is also the joint 10th all time goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup with 10 goals in 13 matches.

In 2004, Pelé selected Cubillas as one of the FIFA 100, a list of 125 footballing greats. In February 2008, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first Brazilian World Cup victory, he was selected in the &quot;All-Star First Team&quot; of South America of the past 50 years. Cubillas is one of only three players to score five or more goals in two different World Cups, the other two being Miroslav Klose and Thomas Müller. His free-kick against Scotland in 1978 is renowned as one of the best goals scored at the World Cup.

==Club career==

=== Early career ===

Nicknamed &quot;Nene&quot; (the kid) for his boyish looks, Cubillas began his career with Alianza Lima at the age of 16 in 1966. While at Alianza, he was top scorer in the Peruvian Primera División in 1966 and 1970.

Cubillas won the youth tournaments of 1965 and 1966. He made his debut at the age of 17 in the Peruvian Primera División with Alianza Lima. In his first season, he was the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with 19 goals. In the summer of 1967, Cubillas, aged 18, made his international debut in a friendly match and scored a double in a 6-1 win over Independiente of Argentina.

Directors of Deportivo Municipal and Alianza Lima formed a team in 1971 to play a series of friendly matches with the aim of bringing together Teófilo Cubillas with Hugo Sotil, another great star of the time, known as the Golden Pair, which left historic scorelines such as the victory over Benfica and the 4-1 thrashing of Bayern Munich.

In 1972, Cubillas had his one of his most successful season in several years. He was the 1972 Copa Libertadores top scorer and elected South American Footballer of the Year.

=== Basel ===
In the summer of 1973, Cubillas transferred to Swiss football club FC Basel under head coach Helmut Benthaus. The Basler entrepreneur and transport company owner Ruedi Reisdorfer paid the transfer fee of £97,000. After playing in four Cup of the Alps games, Cubillas played his Swiss league debut for the club on 18 August in the away game against Chênois. He scored his first goal for the club in the same game as Basel won 1–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-chênoi-fcb-1973/74&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cubillas scored two goals for Basel in the 1973–74 European Cup, the first of which in the 1st leg against Fram on 19 September 1973 and the second in the return leg on 20 September. He only remained at the club for six months, where Cubillas played a total of 21 games for Basel scoring a total of 8 goals.

FC Porto, Sporting CP, FC Barcelona, AC Milan and Real Madrid took interest in Cubillas. But Basel was not willing to let the footballer go so soon. In December 1973, the Portuguese from Porto announced that they could raise enough money for the transfer, a commercial strategy that would be the last chance for Cubillas. Finally, Basel accepted and Cubillas was able to transfer to Portuguese club FC Porto for a fee of £200,000.

=== Porto ===

Cubilla arrived at Porto wearing the number 10 shirt and enjoying his best years as a player. Despite not winning the league, he won the captain&#x27;s armband, becoming the true idol, top scorer and captain of Porto. He scored 66 goals in 110 games, won the Taça de Portugal and two league runner-up finishes.

Cubillas is considered the best foreign player to have played for FC Porto. Nene himself remembers that &quot;He was the highest paid player in the country, even ahead of Eusébio, a legend of Benfica and world football.&quot;

=== Alianza Lima ===

After his outstanding time in Portugal in 1977, Cubillas returned to Peru to play again for Alianza Lima. Cubillas, along with many other players such as Hugo Sotil, César Cueto, José Velásquez and other, formed one of the best Alianza Lima sides in their history.

The 1977 Torneo Descentralizado tournament was between Alianza Lima and Melgar, both teams with the only chances of lifting the championship trophy. For Melgar, the objective was to defeat Sporting Cristal and hope that Alianza Lima did not score any points against Universitario. Sporting Cristal came out defeating Melgar and Alianza Lima defeated Universitario at home 4-3 winning the 1977 tournament with Cubillas scoring two of the goals. Cubillas would win the national championship again with Alianza in 1978.

=== Fort Lauderdale Strikers ===
In 1979, Cubillas joined the NASL, signing for Fort Lauderdale Strikers, where he spent five seasons, scoring 59 league goals, including three goals in seven minutes against the Los Angeles Aztecs in 1981.

In May 1988 Cubillas returned with the newly resurrected Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Soccer League. The Strikers went to the ASL title game where they fell to the Washington Diplomats. Following the loss to the Diplomats, the Strikers released Cubillas.

=== Return to Alianza Lima ===
Following the December 1987 Alianza Lima air crash Cubillas returned from Miami to play for free for Alianza, who lost most of their players in the crash. He also managed the club for a period in 1988.

=== Miami Sharks ===
In March 1989, he signed with the Miami Sharks but was released on 3 July after scoring only one goal in eight games. That same year Cubillas retired at the age of 40. In June 1991 he was playing and coaching at Miramar Illusiones of the Gold Coast Soccer League in Florida.

== International career ==

After standing out notably in local football, he was called up to the Peru national team by head coach Didi for 1968 for the qualifiers for the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico. At just 18 years old, Cubillas made his official debut against Argentina in the qualifiers in the last round of qualifiers in 1968. In a match that will be difficult to forget for both Peruvians and Argentines, led by Cubillas, Peru started a heroic draw in 2 to 2 that took them to the World Cup and that eliminated the Argentine national team. Cubillas would score his first goal for Peru on 8 May, 1969 in a friendly against Colombia in Bogotá. Cubillas would play in three World Cups between 1970 and 1982 along with one Copa América.

===1970 World Cup ===

Cubillas helped the Peru national team advance to the quarter-finals of the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. He scored in all of Peru&#x27;s four matches: once against Bulgaria, twice against Morocco, and once against West Germany, all in the first round. Cubillas then scored another goal in the quarter-final loss against eventual champions Brazil, and he thus finished as the third highest goal scorer in the tournament.

After winning the 1970 World Cup, Pelé who has been Cubillas&#x27;s idol quoted, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I already have a successor and it is Teófilo Cubillas&quot;. Cubillas won the FIFA World Cup Young Player Award of the tournament, and was third in the Golden Shoe award.

===1975 Copa America===
The Peru national team failed qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, with Cubillas missing out on the play off match against Chile. A year later however, Cubillas helped Peru win its second Copa América, winning the 1975 Copa América. Peru was placed in a group with Chile and Bolivia. After eliminating Chile and Bolivia in the first round, the country faced Brazil in the semi-finals. Cubillas scored against Brazil to reach the final against Colombia. The first match was played in Bogotá, where Peru lost 1-0. The second match was played in Lima and Peru won 2-0. However, both teams were level on points and had to play in the play-off final. Cubillas played in the play-off match in the final, where partner Hugo Sotil scored to make the game 1-0. As a result, Peru won its second continental tournament. Cubillas was the Best Player of that tournament and among his goals is the beautiful goal against Brazil in Peru&#x27;s historic 3-1 victory over Brazil, played in Belo Horizonte. 

===1978 World Cup===

Cubillas played in the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, with a good start, showing his skill, finishing co-second highest goal scorer after Mario Kempes, and helping Peru win first place of its group, advancing to the second round. In the match against Scotland Cubillas scored two goals and then scored a hat-trick in the game against Iran, including two penalties. The magnificent free kick goal that Cubillas scored against Scotland with the outside edge of his boot, is today in the FIFA archives as a model of free kick execution and is considered one of the best in history. In that tournament, Peru&#x27;s midfield made up of José Velásquez, César Cueto and Cubillas was considered by international critics as the best of the first phase of the World Cup. 

Already in the quarterfinals, the Peruvian team dropped its level and ended up being beaten by Argentina 6-0, a result that generated controversy, because for all experts there was no football difference to give that result and this allowed Argentina to qualify for the final. Peru subsequently lost to Brazil and Poland, finishing last with zero points. Cubillas played all six of Peru&#x27;s matches in the tournament and won the Silver Boot as the tournament&#x27;s second top scorer and was considered part of the championship&#x27;s ideal team.

===1982 World Cup===
Cubillas was also in the Peru national team for 1982 FIFA World Cup. He played in all three group games but did not score any goals. After being eliminated in the first phase, Cubillas would retire from the national team at the age of 33, with a total of 28 goals scored in 81 appearances.

<doc id="615820" wikidata="Q210083" url="?curid=615820" title="Enzo Francescoli">
<text>Enzo Francescoli Uriarte (; born 12 November 1961), nicknamed &quot;El Príncipe&quot; (), is a Uruguayan former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He is regarded as one of the best playmakers of his generation and as one of Uruguay&#x27;s and South America&#x27;s greatest ever players. He represented his nation at two FIFA World Cups, in 1986 and 1990, also winning the Copa América in 1983, 1987 and 1995.

At club level, Francescoli began his career with Uruguayan club Wanderers. In neighbouring Argentina, he played for River Plate. He was the leading scorer and a key player for the club&#x27;s second Copa Libertadores title. Francescoli won a total of five Argentine titles in the six years in which he played for the club. He also enjoyed success in France with Racing Paris and Marseille, where his performances proved decisive as the team won the 1989–90 French Division 1. He later also had spells in Italy with Cagliari and Torino, before returning to River Plate, where he ended his career.

He was considered an elite playmaker in the Uruguay national team. He played 73 times for the &quot;Celeste&quot; between 1982 and his retirement in 1997, making him the most capped outfield player in Uruguayan international football at the time.

Francescoli was the only Uruguayan included by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living footballers in 2004, and he was also elected by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics as the sixth-greatest Uruguayan player and the 24th greatest South American player of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Francescoli was born in Montevideo into a family of Italian and Basque origin. Since childhood, he was known as a shy and reserved person who spoke little and, in what he regarded as a virtue, was very observant, being regarded by those who knew him as very kind inside and outside football. Due to his slender frame, he was nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; (&quot;The Skinny One&quot;).

==Club career==

===Montevideo Wanderers===

As a young fan of Peñarol, Francescoli passed a try-out but did not join, unimpressed by the lack of playing time. Despite another successful try-out with South American powerhouse River Plate, which he would later join in 1983, he chose to stay at his high school football team while completing his studies, winning five championships.

In his last year of high school, he received an offer from his hometown club Montevideo Wanderers and joined after graduating. In 1980, he debuted with the Wanderers first team, achieving their best position since their fourth and last national title in 1931, a second-place finish. His elegant behaviour and playing style earned him the nickname &quot;El Príncipe&quot; (&quot;The Prince&quot;), a nickname inherited from Hannibal Ciocca, a former Wanderers player. He developed the habit of chewing gum during games in order to avoid dryness in his mouth. He stated he became so dependent on the habit that he did not feel right when he did not have any gum before games.

In the Uruguayan Primera División in 1981, Francescoli performed well for the team, which finished only behind Peñarol and Nacional. In February 1982, he made his debut for the Uruguay national team. Later that year, he made his Copa Libertadores debut, ironically after his worst result with the Wanderers in the national championship, a fifth-place finish.

Vying for a place with his team in the 1983 Copa Libertadores, Francescoli and his team, which included other notable players such as Jorge Barrios, Luis Alberto Acosta, Raúl Esnal and Ariel Krasouski, had a respectable season, finishing first in their group, tied with Nacional, and were only eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal play-off match.

===River Plate===

After Francescoli won the 1983 Copa América with Uruguay, River Plate signed him later that year for $310,000. The following year, Francescoli was unable to show his potential, splitting time with other players. He saw more playing time towards the end of the season when the team reached the Argentine final, but was defeated 3–0 by Ferro Carril Oeste. Nevertheless, Francescoli, was voted the best South American footballer of 1984 for his performances for River Plate and the Uruguay national team, featuring alongside players such as Nelson Gutiérrez and Antonio Alzamendi, among others. Eager to excel with River Plate, Francescoli rejected an offer from América de Cali (later found to be funded by the Cali Cartel) which was doing well that year and would go on to become the Copa Libertadores runners-up between 1985 and 1987.

Although the team did not win the championship in 1985, Francescoli was voted Argentina&#x27;s best player, the first foreign player to be given the honour. He finally won the Argentine title with River Plate the next season, claiming the 1985–86 Championship which had been re-established as a single tournament. He ended the season as top scorer with 25 goals, three of which came in a 5–4 victory against Argentinos Juniors for the championship match and qualified for the Copa Libertadores. In January 1986, he scored his most famous goal: a decisive bicycle kick which gave River Plate a victory over the Poland national team in a friendly tournament organized by the five largest Argentine clubs.

After winning the Argentine title, Francescoli moved to Europe, where he was signed by Racing Paris, who had just been promoted from the French Second Division. Nantes was willing to pay $2.5 million for his contract, but River Plate&#x27;s president at the time, Hugo Santilli, believed Francescoli could fetch a better price.

===RC Paris===
Francescoli began his European career with Racing Paris in 1986, a long established team which had been in a slump since the 1950s and had recently started a rivalry with its growing neighbour, Paris Saint-Germain founded in 1970, which had won the French title the previous season. Automotive company Matra decided to sponsor the team, which resulted in the name being changed to Matra Racing in 1987. Seeking to dominate the 1993 Ligue 1, the domestic cups and qualify for the UEFA Champions League, automobile company magnate Jean-Luc Lagardère later provided funding to the club, allowing the team to sign footballers Luis Fernández, Maxime Bossis, Thierry Tusseau, David Ginola, along with Cameroonian Eugène Ekéké, Dutchman Sonny Silooy, German Pierre Littbarski and fellow Uruguayan Rubén Paz. In Francescoli&#x27;s first season, the team managed to finish 13th overall in part due to Francescoli&#x27;s 14 goals, which made him one of the league&#x27;s top scorers that season.

Francescoli became a team idol and in 1987 was elected the best foreign player in France. For the 1987–88 season, Portuguese coach Artur Jorge, who had previously won the European Cup, was brought to the team. Francescoli would later describe Artur Jorge as the best coach he had worked with throughout his career. Matra Racing had been struggling to reach the top of the table, alternating between third and second place from the second half of the season onwards. However, after a series of matches, the team stood 11 points behind Monaco. Francescoli scored eight times in the league, finishing once again as the club&#x27;s top scorer. During this period, he received an offer from Juventus due to the untimely retirement of its captain and star player Michel Platini in 1987, although Francescoli refused the offer. Francescoli finished the 1988–89 championship as the club&#x27;s top scorer for the third consecutive season, and avoiding relegation.

The sub-par season of Matra Racing did not prevent Francescoli from being seen as a star worldwide. In March 1989, he earned a spot on the Uruguayan international team that played against the Brazil national team in an international friendly in Brazil that marked Zico&#x27;s retirement, scoring one of his team&#x27;s goals in a 2–1 victory. However, domestically he had suffered several disappointments and was frustrated by his team&#x27;s lack of success in the Coupe de France. Racing soon filed for bankruptcy and left the French League, losing its spot to their financially sound cross-city rivals Paris Saint-Germain.

===Marseille===
Francescoli transferred to Marseille in 1989. He spent only one season with the club, where he won the 1989–90 French Division 1 title, scoring 11 goals in 28 appearances, and grabbed the attention of an important fan, Zinedine Zidane. Francescoli was sorely missed by his former team Racing, which, in his absence, was unable to avoid relegation. Ironically, Francescoli faced his former club in the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. Racing won the match, although under odd circumstances: with eight minutes remaining, Francescoli scored a goal which would have tied the match, although it was disallowed due to a technicality, and Marseille eventually lost 3–2. Francescoli also helped Marseille to the semi-finals of the 1989–90 European Cup.

===Cagliari===
After the 1990 World Cup in Italy, in which Uruguay had been eliminated by the hosts in the round of 16, Francescoli moved to the Italian Serie A, and along with international teammates José Herrera and Daniel Fonseca, was signed by Cagliari. He initially struggled to find form with his new club, playing in a deeper midfield role, as Cagliari fought against relegation during his first two seasons. Due to his deeper playing position, Francescoli&#x27;s goalscoring output suffered, and he was far less prolific as he totalled just four goals in the 1990–91 season, and six in the 1991–92 Serie A season. Cagliari avoided relegation on both occasions, but were eliminated in the first round of the 1991–92 Coppa Italia.

Francescoli&#x27;s third season in Italy was by far his best. In the Coppa Italia, he scored three goals before the team was eliminated in the quarter-finals against Fabio Capello&#x27;s Milan, which conquered the league title that year. In Serie A, Cagliari earned a surprising sixth place, earning a spot in the UEFA Cup, with Francescoli scoring seven league goals, his personal best in a single Serie A season. In total, Francescoli managed 17 goals in 98 league appearances for Cagliari. Due to his key performances, he is regarded as one of the club&#x27;s greatest ever players, and was included in the Cagliari Hall of Fame, and in the club&#x27;s best ever starting XI.

===Torino===
In 1993, Francescoli accepted an offer from Turin side Torino, the most recent winner of the Coppa Italia.

The 1993 Supercoppa Italiana final was the closest Francescoli ever came to winning a trophy during his time in Italy, as Torino ultimately lost the title to Milan. With Francescoli, Torino came close to defending the title the following season, but the club was defeated by Ancona in a semi-final upset. However, the club&#x27;s Serie A campaign was more heavily contested. After initially fighting against relegation, Torino climbed the table to clinch a spot in the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, earning four points more than the required amount to qualify for the tournament. In the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, for which they had qualified the previous season as the 1993 Italian Cup champions, Torino reached the quarter-finals, only to be eliminated by eventual champions Arsenal. Despite a successful season for the team, Francescoli did not perform as well as in previous seasons, from an individual standpoint, as he only scored three goals in 24 appearances, his lowest tally during his four seasons in the Italian league.

===Return to River Plate===
In 1994, at age 33, after an uninspiring season with Torino, Francescoli decided to return to Argentina to play for former team River Plate, where he had previously played his best football. Despite his age, he was determined to prove that he could still compete at the top level, and performed well in the Apertura championship with the team that year (the Argentine season returned to being divided into two separate tournaments, Apertura and Clausura, in 1990–91). The season also marked the first time River Plate had managed to become undefeated champions.

The team had a less exciting season in 1995, finishing tenth in the Clausura, and seventh in the Apertura, while suffering a semifinal elimination against Colombia&#x27;s Atlético Nacional in the Copa Libertadores. The team was eventually eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions Independiente in the Copa Libertadores, in which Francescoli played as striker. That year, he was voted South American Player of the Year and he also received the title of Argentine Player of the Year, ten years after first receiving it.

The next year, Francescoli retired from the &quot;Celeste&quot; to devote himself entirely to River Plate at club level, recapturing his best form, scoring 19 goals in total. The 1996 season was his most important as Francescoli led a young, talented, yet inexperienced team that included Ariel Ortega, Matías Almeyda, Juan Pablo Sorín, Hernán Crespo and Marcelo Gallardo to win the 1996 Copa Libertadores title, and his second league title, briefly tying the record of 15 titles set by rivals Boca Juniors.

Francescoli finished his season with River Plate with a defeat in the 1996 Intercontinental Cup final against Italian side Juventus. River Plate had the chance to equal Boca Juniors with two Intercontinental Cup titles, but ultimately lost to the Italian side for which a fan of Francescoli played. Zinedine Zidane said, &quot;when I saw Francescoli play, he was the player I wanted to be. He was the player that I saw and admired at Olympique de Marseille, my idol when I played against him when I was at Juventus... Enzo is like a god.&quot; At the end of the year, Francescoli decided to come out of international retirement in order to aid Uruguay in qualifying for the upcoming World Cup in France.

The following season, Francescoli suffered further disappointment, with a penalty shoot-out defeat to Racing Club at the Estadio Monumental, as River Plate were eliminated in the round of 16 of the 1997 Copa Libertadores. However, despite the early exit in the continental tournament, River Plate enjoyed much success domestically, following up their 1996 Copa Libertadores title with a fortunate treble the next year: the Clausura, Apertura and the Supercopa Libertadores.

After failing to help Uruguay qualify for the 1998 World Cup, Francescoli announced he would retire in early 1998, refusing an offer of roughly a million dollars to continue, feeling he could not play another year due to continuing injury struggles. Poor sleeping habits caused by stress had forced him to seek therapy since 1996. His last two matches for River Plate were historical as within four days they had won two titles. The first, on 17 December 1997, was the deciding second leg of the Supercopa Libertadores, against São Paulo. It was the last ever edition of the tournament, one which River Plate had never won, which presented a situation described as &quot;now or never&quot;. The Brazilian team, who had drawn in Brazil, were beaten 2–1 at the Monumental of Núñez. Then, on 21 December, River drew 1–1 with the Argentinos Juniors at the Estádio José Amalfitani and became 1997 Apertura champions, concluding the Argentine treble having won the 1996 Apertura and 1997 Clausura), beating out arch-rivals Boca Juniors, the other contender for the title and suffering only one defeat in the league.

On 1 August 1999, Francescoli returned to the Monumental for a friendly farewell match. Sixty-five thousand spectators were present, among them President of Argentina Carlos Menem and President of Uruguay Julio María Sanguinetti, as well as some Boca Juniors fans. The match brought together the friends of River Plate with those of the club he had hoped to play for during his childhood, Peñarol, who won the match 4–0. After the match, the field was taken by thousands of children, for whom Francescoli, along with other players, signed autographs, also kicking the ball around with them.

Another River Plate legend from Uruguay, Walter Gómez, kicked off. When approaching the day of his retirement, Argentine composer Ignacio Copani dedicated his song &quot;Inmenzo&quot; (a pun on &quot;Enzo&quot;) to Francescoli, ending with the crowd requesting an encore.

After his retirement, the team were only able to succeed locally for some time, failing to earn the same international respect in previous years, entering a crisis that would culminate in an unprecedented relegation in 2011 – ironically, exactly 15 years to the day after the team had won the 1996 Copa Libertadores with Francescoli. He is still the team&#x27;s seventh all-time leading goalscorer, with 115 goals in 198 matches, and is the third highest foreign goalscorer in the history of Argentine football, only behind Paraguayans Arsenio Erico and Delfín Benítez Cáceres.

===Exhibition matches===

Since his retirement, Francescoli has only returned to the pitch for exhibition matches, such as those commemorating the retirement of Juan Pablo Sorín, Víctor Aristizábal and Diego Maradona, considered by him to be the greatest player he has seen, and other friends. Maradona almost did not participate in the match since the River Plate fans were strongly opposed to it. &quot;There was no problem for me. There are three things I do not discuss nor with my best friends: Religion, politics and football...things in that person, mistaken or not, advocates a cause,&quot; Francescoli said. He added, &quot;[Y]ou&#x27;ll never hear me saying &#x27;I live and die for River Plate&#x27;, though I may be much more of a fan than others.&quot; After Maradona, the second greatest player he stated he had seen was Zinedine Zidane, an opinion he admits was heavily influenced by emotional reasons, as Zidane was a big fan of Francescoli.

In July 2012, in Ariel Ortega&#x27;s testimonial, Francescoli scored four goals at the age of 50, the last of which was a bicycle kick in the penalty area.

==International career==
In 1981, one year after his professional debut, Francescoli joined the Uruguayan team that won the South American Under-20 Championship. He was named one of the best young players in the world that year, also making three appearances in the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his debut for the senior team in 1982, competing in a friendly tournament in India. The following year, as a member of the Uruguay squad in the 1983 Copa América, he scored his first international goal in a 2–0 victory over Brazil.

Uruguay qualified for the 1986 World Cup after a close match against Chile, in a qualifying group that also included Peru. Francescoli&#x27;s ability was questioned by critics. However, Uruguayan coach Omar Borrás said, &quot;Everyone talks about Platini, Maradona, of Elkjær ... but our Francescoli has everything to be the highlight of the World Cup.&quot;
However, Uruguay&#x27;s performance in the tournament were less than stellar. The team earned two draws and two defeats, advancing to the second round only as one of the best third-placed teams, while Francescoli only scored once throughout the entire tournament, in an infamous 1–6 defeat to Denmark in the first round. This tournament was seen by Francescoli as his worst performance in his entire career. He stated in an interview, &quot;[T]he only thing I ask is forgiveness from all Uruguayans.&quot; Uruguay ultimately fell in the round of 16, to the eventual champions Argentina, led by eventual Golden Ball winner Diego Maradona.
The disappointment was assuaged the next year with the victory of the 1987 Copa América as defending champions. Francescoli shone for Uruguay in the semi-final against hosts and defending World Cup champions Argentina in the Estadio Monumental de Núñez (the stadium of his former club, River Plate). A win against Chile in the final of the tournament followed, and the victory gave Uruguay their record 13th continental title.

Two years later in the 1989 Copa América, Francescoli played in four of five matches, winning three and helping Uruguay to reach the final round for the third consecutive time. The final match was played against hosts and favourites Brazil, coincidentally in similar circumstances to the last round of the final round of the 1950 World Cup. The match was also played on the same date, 16 July, and at the same stadium, the Maracanã. As in 1950, the Brazilians took the lead, although they were the winners on this occasion.

During the qualifiers for the 1990 World Cup, the Uruguayans once again needed to overcome several obstacles in order to seal qualification: Bolivia proved to be the toughest opponent in the group, alongside Peru. Francescoli and his teammates had the task of defeating both teams in the final two games of the qualification campaign, and succeeded, ensuring their place in the World Cup play-offs, in which they overcame Bolivia to qualify for the upcoming tournament.

In his second World Cup, Francescoli did not perform much better than in the previous tournament. Although many analysts regarded him as one of the potential stars of the tournament due to his talent and ability to be decisive for his team, Uruguay again did not fare very well, earning only one win in a 1–0 group stage victory over South Korea, once again advancing to the second round as one of the best third-placed teams. The team were eliminated in the round of 16, suffering a 2–0 defeat against hosts Italy, on this occasion, who went on to finish the tournament in third place. This was Francescoli&#x27;s final World Cup. In total, he made eight World Cup appearances, scoring once and appearing in each of Uruguay&#x27;s matches in both the 1986 and 1990 tournaments. Altogether, he played in eight World Cup matches, losing four, tying three and winning one.

After the 1990 World Cup, national team coach Óscar Tabárez was replaced by Luis Cubilla, who had trained the under-used Francescoli at River Plate, when Francescoli had first arrived at the club years before. Cubilla brought a strong feeling of nationalism among Uruguayan fans at the time, specifically of resentment against the country&#x27;s athletes who played in Europe, and even hinted that Francescoli, and also Rubén Sosa, Carlos Aguilera and Oscar Herrera, were &quot;dinheiristas&quot; (&quot;mercenaries&quot;). Appalled, they refused to play if Cubilla did not recant his comments and these players were left out of the 1991 Copa América. Without the &quot;European&quot; stars, Uruguay collapsed in the first round. By the time the 1993 tournament came around, the players had already been called back to the team. Although he had been called up by Cubilla, Francescoli was benched throughout the tournament, and Uruguay once again disappointed, suffering a quarter-final elimination. In a friendly match later that year, Francescoli made his first appearance for the &quot;Celeste&quot; in many years. Meanwhile, South American rivals Argentina won both the 1991 and 1993 editions of the tournament, overtaking Uruguay as the team with the most Copa América titles (14).

Although Francescoli&#x27;s role in the team was disputed during a low point in his international career, he showed he was still an important player for the national team, and appeared for Uruguay in the qualifying rounds for the 1994 World Cup. Uruguay reached the CONMEBOL Group 2 final round of the South American qualifiers, along with Bolivia, Brazil and the two wildcard teams Ecuador and Venezuela. Uruguay, Bolivia and Brazil each had ten points in the group, and Brazil and Uruguay faced each other at the Maracanã on 19 September 1993. Uruguay lost the match 2–0, as Brazil topped the group to qualify for the upcoming tournament. As Bolivia was able to earn a draw in their fixture, the Uruguayans came third in the group, failing to qualify for the competition. Although the team failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup in the United States, Francescoli overcame one of his biggest struggles throughout his career as after two years, national team&#x27;s coach Cubilla was relieved of his position. After the defeat against Brazil at the Maracanã in Uruguay&#x27;s final qualification match, Cubilla had said of Francescoli, &quot;That man is a traitor to his country, so take away his passport!&quot; Francescoli later stated in a 2008 interview that this was a low point in his career, and that his coach&#x27;s comment caused him sit in a corner of the Maracanã and cry.

The 1995 Copa América on home soil under Uruguay&#x27;s new head coach, Héctor Núñez, was a breath of fresh air for Francescoli. After not featuring in the previous two editions of the tournament (although he was named to the squad in 1993, he did not play a single match), Francescoli carried his team to the Copa América final against Brazil, at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo. Uruguay won a hard-fought final 5–3 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw, with Francescoli converting his team&#x27;s first penalty, as he lifted the title for the last time. As a result, Uruguay equalled Argentina as the South American national team with the most Copa América titles (14). Uruguay later broke the record in 2011, with the victory of their 15th Copa América title. Francescoli was once again named player of the tournament, and was also elected the best player in South America, at age 34, 11 years after first receiving the honour. In the tournament, he also scored his final goal for the national team, which came in the group stage in a 1–0 win against Paraguay. In total, Francescoli made 16 appearances over four editions of the Copa América, scoring five goals, and reaching the final on all four occasions in which he played.

Francescoli announced his retirement from international football after winning the Copa América for the third time. However, he briefly came out of international retirement during Uruguay&#x27;s qualifying campaign for the 1998 World Cup, after his teammates had persuaded him to return, with President of Uruguay Julio María Sanguinetti also asking him personally. In October 1996, Francescoli returned to play for the national team, although he did not take part in the 1997 Copa América. He played in eight matches in June of that year, after the continental tournament. His last two matches with the &quot;Celeste&quot; came in July and August 1997. The Uruguayans still had three World Cup South American qualifying matches remaining, but reached the last match with no mathematical chance of qualifying for the tournament and finishing seventh in their group.

Francescoli made 73 official appearances for his country, with 37 wins, 18 draws and 18 defeats, and scoring 17 goals. He was praised for his performances in a difficult period for the national team, retiring as the player with the second most appearances for Uruguay, only four games behind the record holder at the time, goalkeeper Rodolfo Rodríguez, despite the three years in which he had been disowned by the national side, and another in which he had voluntarily retired. Later, his record would be broken by goalkeeper Fabián Carini and also by striker Diego Forlán.

==Style of play and legacy==

A quick, elegant, creative and technically gifted attacking midfielder who was also capable of playing in the centre as a second striker, Francescoli was noted in particular for his control, grace, fluidity, dribbling skills and ability on the ball, despite his lack of notable pace. A two-footed playmaker with excellent vision, passing ability, and an eye for goal from midfield, he was also known for his ability from set-pieces, and also had a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals from overhead kicks. These qualities would later influence the style of French creative offensive midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who has stated that, along with compatriot Michel Platini, Francescoli was one of his favourite players as a young boy, and that he would often watch him train with Marseille. Zidane even named one of his sons, Enzo, in homage to him. Francescoli learned of this fact just before the Intercontinental Cup final match of 1996, and so the two players swapped jerseys at the end of the match. The piece became a favourite of Zidane&#x27;s to wear. Subsequently, the two presented television show &quot;Football Cracks&quot;, a reality show that sought new football talent in Spain. Francescoli&#x27;s admiration for Zidane extended to other French players and he has stated he felt more respect from French fans than he had while playing there.

Other players to have been named after him are Argentine internationals Enzo Pérez and Enzo Fernández, both of whom have also played for River Plate. Argentine striker Diego Milito has also been given the nickname &quot;&quot;Il Principe&quot; during Milito&#x27;s tenure with Inter Milan due to his elegant style of play and physical resemblance to Francescoli. Francescoli has joked saying that neither of his sons resemble him as much as Milito, both in physical appearance and in their walk. Furthermore, Argentine attacking midfielder Javier Pastore, who was also a fan of Francescoli as a youngster, was given the Uruguayan&#x27;s other nickname &quot;El Flaco&quot;&quot;, because of their similar style of play as well as their slender build.

In recognition of his talent, Francescoli was the only Uruguayan footballer to be named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

==Media career==
Francescoli went to live with his family in Miami, where he would create TV station GOL TV with former manager Paco Casal. Francescoli returned to Buenos Aires five years later, although he still travelled monthly to the United States because of his activities there. For the 2010 World Cup, he led the team of Channel 7 Argentina, Argentina&#x27;s state broadcaster.

==Coaching career==
Since leaving television, Francescoli was asked several times to coach River Plate, but he never accepted, stating instead that if asked to be manager of the club, he might accept, since he could employ the lessons that had learned as an entrepreneur.

However, one factor that prevented him from having more acceptance in Uruguay was his relationship with Paco Casal. There was controversy in Uruguay over his buying football television rights through his company Tenfield SA. A known critic said, &quot;The contract with Tenfield SA... has been detrimental to Uruguayan football. Players earn ever lower wages, clubs are bankrupt, but entrepreneurs are getting richer. Only journalists who support the contractual relationship between the AUF and Tenfield are those who work for the company, which has a monopoly in the country.&quot; Francescoli said of Casal, &quot;He is the most important businessman in my country, and built [his power] from nothing. He is involved in things that generate passion for football and carnival, and this creates divisions [of opinions]... he is a good person. The man helps more than people believe. Paco did not get up one day and said, &#x27;I want to be owner of Uruguayan football.&#x27; Paco was given ownership because the leaders were not able to sell the players that they developed.&quot;

===River Plate===
After many wins, titles and trophies with River Plate as a player, Francescoli was back with the club in a leadership role under Rodolfo Raúl D&#x27;Onofrio. Francescoli became the head of player personnel for River Plate. It was his decision to bring on a young coach and former River Plate teammate Marcelo Gallardo after the departure of Ramón Díaz. After hiring Gallardo, River Plate had immense international success, as the team conquered all continental CONMEBOL trophies: the Copa Sudamericana 2014, Recopa Sudamericana 2015 and the Copa Libertadores 2015. River Plate also won the first Suruga Bank Championship 2015. Under his leadership and Gallardo&#x27;s touch, River Plate won the Copa Libertadores 2018, beating their life-long rivals Boca Juniors.

==Personal life==
Francescoli has been married to Mariela Yern since 1984 and has two sons with her, Bruno and Marco. His wife is a psychologist, which he stated was of great value to their marriage. As a footballer, he required emotional sympathy, he stated in an interview program in 2000. Bruno studied law, while Marco tried to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, eventually playing for Cagliari, where he played for three years, and then Estudiantes de La Plata, but did not get much further. One factor for his retirement from football was his desire to be closer to his two sons. Francescoli has two brothers: Luis Ernesto, two years older; and Pablo, 13 years younger. Outside of football, he also enjoys smoking, a habit that he has had since age 16, and playing golf.

Francescoli was made the Uruguayan ambassador for UNICEF after Diego Forlán in 2002.

<text>A borescope (occasionally called a boroscope, though this spelling is nonstandard) is an optical instrument designed to assist visual inspection of narrow, difficult-to-reach cavities, consisting of a rigid or flexible tube with an eyepiece or display on one end, an objective lens or camera on the other, linked together by an optical or electrical system in between. The optical system in some instances is accompanied by (typically fiberoptic) illumination to enhance brightness and contrast. An internal image of the illuminated object is formed by the objective lens and magnified by the eyepiece which presents it to the viewer&#x27;s eye.

Rigid or flexible borescopes may be externally linked to a photography or videography device. For medical use, similar instruments are called endoscopes.

== Uses ==

Borescopes are used for visual inspection work where the target area is inaccessible by other means, or where accessibility may require destructive, time consuming and/or expensive dismounting activities. Similar devices for use inside the human body are referred to as endoscopes. Borescopes are mostly used in nondestructive testing techniques for recognizing defects or imperfections.

Borescopes are commonly used in the visual inspection of aircraft engines, aeroderivative industrial gas turbines, steam turbines, diesel engines, and automotive and truck engines. Gas and steam turbines require particular attention because of safety and maintenance requirements. Borescope inspection of engines can be used to prevent unnecessary maintenance, which can become extremely costly for large turbines. They are also used in manufacturing of machined or cast parts to inspect critical interior surfaces for burrs, surface finish or complete through-holes. Other common uses include forensic applications in law enforcement and building inspection, and in gunsmithing for inspecting the interior bore of a firearm. In World War II, primitive rigid borescopes were used to examine the interior bores (hence &quot;bore&quot; scope) of large guns for defects.

== Flexible versus rigid ==

The traditional flexible borescope includes a bundle of optical fibers which divide the image into pixels. It is also known as a fiberscope and can be used to access cavities which are around a bend, such as a combustion chamber or &quot;burner can&quot;, in order to view the condition of the compressed air inlets, turbine blades and seals without disassembling the engine. Traditional flexible borescopes suffer from pixelation and pixel crosstalk due to the fiber image guide. Image quality varies widely among different models of flexible borescopes depending on the number of fibers and construction used in the fiber image guide. Some high-end borescopes offer a &quot;visual grid&quot; on image captures to assist in evaluating the size of any area with a problem. For flexible borescopes, articulation mechanism components, range of articulation, field of view and angles of view of the objective lens are also important. Fiber content in the flexible relay is also critical to provide the highest possible resolution to the viewer. Minimal quantity is 10,000 pixels while the best images are obtained with higher numbers of fibers in the 15,000 to 22,000 range for the larger diameter borescopes. The ability to control the light at the end of the insertion tube allows the borescope user to make adjustments that can greatly improve the clarity of video or still images.

Rigid borescopes are similar to fiberscopes but generally provide a superior image at lower cost compared to a flexible borescope. Rigid borescopes have the limitation that access to what is to be viewed must be in a straight line. Rigid borescopes are therefore better suited to certain tasks such as inspecting automotive cylinders, fuel injectors and hydraulic manifold bodies, and gunsmithing. Criteria for selecting a borescope are usually image clarity and access. For similar-quality instruments, the largest rigid borescope that will fit the hole gives the best image. Optical systems in rigid borescopes can be of three basic types: Harold Hopkins rod lenses, achromatic doublets, and gradient index rod lenses. For large-diameter borescopes (over ), the achromatic doublet relays work quite well, but as the diameter of the borescope tube gets smaller the Hopkins rod lens and gradient index rod lens designs provide superior images. For very small rigid borescopes (under ), the gradient index lens relays are better.

== Video borescopes ==

A video borescope, videoscope, or &quot;inspection camera&quot; is similar to the flexible borescope but uses a miniature video camera at the end of the flexible tube. The end of the insertion tube includes a light which makes it possible to capture video or still images deep within equipment, engines and other dark spaces. As a tool for remote visual inspection the ability to capture video or still images for later inspection is a huge benefit. A display at the other end shows the camera view, and in some models the viewing position can be changed via a joystick or similar control. Because a complex fiber optic waveguide in a traditional borescope is replaced with an inexpensive electrical cable, video borescopes can be much less costly and potentially better resolution (depending on the specifications of the camera). Easy-to-use, battery-powered video borescopes, with LCD displays of 320×240 pixels or better, became available from several manufacturers and are adequate for some applications. On many of these models, the video camera and flexible tube is submersible. Later models offered improved features, such as better resolution, adjustable illumination or replacing the built-in display with a computer connection, such as a USB cable.

<text>Jan Anna Gumaar Ceulemans (; born 28 February 1957) is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as midfielder. A prolific goalscorer, Ceulemans was known for his stamina, aerial ability, technique and was also recognized as one of the greatest Belgium footballers of all time. He was also known for his power, imposing frame and natural authority.

Ceulemans was also a regular member of the Belgium national football team, with 96 international appearances, a record that stood for 26 years until it was surpassed by Jan Vertonghen&#x27;s 97th appearance for Belgium on 10 October 2017; Ceulemans is now the ninth most-capped for Belgium. He still holds the record for most appearances in the Belgian Pro League with 517. Most of his time with Belgium took place under the guidance of Guy Thys. This period saw the Belgium squad record some of their finest results, which include reaching the final of Euro 80 and fourth place at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

==Career==
Ceulemans was born in Lier, Belgium. His first of three World Cup appearances was at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where Belgium beat the defending champions Argentina 1–0 in the opening game of the tournament at Camp Nou en route to reaching the second round. Among Ceulemans&#x27; finest achievements was captaining his national side to fourth place in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, scoring three goals in the tournament including a spectacular diving header against Spain in the quarter-finals. His performance earned the nickname &quot;Captain Courageous&quot;. He retired from international competition after the 1990 FIFA World Cup; Jan scored the third goal in a 3–1 win over Uruguay but Belgium was eliminated by England in the round of sixteen, with the winning goal being scored by David Platt in the 119th minute in extra time. Jan had struck the post during the game.

Professionally, he stayed at Club Brugge for 13 years, endearing himself to his country when he turned down an offer from Italian club A.C. Milan. He remains the only football player to have posed with the A.C. Milan board for the press that never actually became an A.C. Milan player.

After retiring as a player due to knee injury, he became a manager at KSC Eendracht Aalst in 1992. He won promotion to Belgian First Division and even a qualification for UEFA Cup. He moved in 1998 to K.V.C. Westerlo where he also qualified for UEFA Cup. In 2005, he is back at &#x27;his&#x27; Club Brugge where he would be manager for three years but after several bad results he was fired in April 2006. For the 2007–08 season, he returned to K.V.C. Westerlo. He currently lives in Westerlo.

Ceulemans was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

==Style of play==

Considered one of Belgium&#x27;s greatest players, Ceulemans was a complete and versatile player, able to play anywhere in midfield or the attack. A physically powerful player with a tall frame, Ceulemans had great technique, was a good passer of the ball, possessed a powerful shot, and was superb in the air. He also stood out for his mentality and leadership on the pitch, receiving the nicknames. Fellow Belgium national team teammate Eric Gerets said of Ceulemans: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t the best dribbler, not the best finisher and not an assist master. He had all three. He was complete.&quot;

<text>Franky Van der Elst (born 30 April 1961) is a Belgian retired professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He later worked as a manager.

During a 21-year professional career he played mainly with Club Brugge, being regarded as a legend there and briefly coaching the team in the 2000s. Also, he was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers, in March 2004.

Van der Elst won 86 caps for the Belgium national team, representing the country in four World Cups and retiring at nearly 40 years of age.

==Playing career==
Born in Ninove, Van der Elst started his professional career at R.W.D. Molenbeek, earning his first call-up for Belgium in 1982. Two years later, he moved to Club Brugge KV and stayed there until he finished his career in 1999, going on to total over 500 overall appearances with the side (466 in the league alone); during four seasons, he often partnered in midfield his namesake Leo – no relation.

Van der Elst won the Golden Shoe twice in his career, an accomplishment for an eminently defensive-minded player. He also appeared in four FIFA World Cups from 1986 to 1998, only scoring once for his country in nearly 90 matches, in a 2–2 friendly draw against Norway on 25 March 1998.

==Coaching career==
After retiring at the age of 38, Van der Elst was appointed as manager at K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot. After four relatively successful years he was replaced by Marc Brys, and subsequently joined K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen.

In 2005, Van der Elst returned to &#x27;his&#x27; Club Brugge, as an assistant, joining former teammates – both in club and country – Jan Ceulemans, Marc Degryse, Dany Verlinden and René Verheyen. He remained with the team when Verheyen and Ceulemans were fired in 2006, but was eventually shown the door the following year, with head coach Emilio Ferrera.

After a very short spell with FC Brussels, Van der Elst moved to K.V.S.K. United Overpelt-Lommel, both clubs in the second level.

<text>Jean-Marie Pfaff (born 4 December 1953) is a Belgian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper and spent most of his professional career with Beveren and Bayern Munich. Pfaff was capped 64 times playing for Belgium, and participated at the 1982 FIFA World Cup and 1986 FIFA World Cup tournaments. Pfaff was named goalkeeper of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and he was the first player to receive the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper award in 1987.

== Early life ==
Pfaff was born in Lebbeke, East Flanders. He grew up in a family of 12 children (6 boys, 6 girls). His father was a door-to-door salesman of fabrics and carpets. The Pfaff family lived in a caravan in Lebbeke and in the summer, the whole family was obliged to help their father with sales.

As a street footballer, his goalkeeping skills were quickly noticed. Pfaff joined the youth team of Eendracht Aalst, the club of his brothers Louis and Jean-Baptist Pfaff. When Louis and Jean-Baptist arranged a transfer to KSK Beveren in 1965, the younger brothers Jean-Marie and Toon also made the switch to the Waasland club.

When Jean-Marie Pfaff was barely 12, his father died of cancer. Obviously, this had enormous consequences for the family.

==Club career==

=== Beveren ===
At the end of the 1971–72 season, Aged 18, Pfaff made his debut for the fist team of Beveren in the Belgian First Division. By then, it was already certain that the club would be relegated to the second division. The following season, Pfaff became a regular goalkeeper. Beveren also became champions, which meant the team was immediately promoted back to the first division.

At the end of the second half of the 1973–74 season, Pfaff was moved to the bench by coach Jef Jurion, but under Urbain Braems he became the first goalkeeper in the 1974–75 season.

During the 1977–78 season, Pfaff reached the Belgian top with SK Beveren. The team then just missed out on the European places in the competition (5th place), but it did manage to reach the Belgian Cup final for the first time. With a 2–0 victory against Charleroi after a few decisive saves by Pfaff, the team also grabbed the cup. This allowed them to compete in Europe the following season. In 1978, Jean-Marie Pfaff won the Belgian Golden Shoe, a trophy that is rarely awarded to goalkeepers.

Beveren would reach its peak in the 1978–79 season. The club became national champion for the first time in its existence, with Pfaff not conceding a goal in half of the matches (17). In the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Beveren surprisingly eliminated Inter Milan in the quarter-finals after strong performances by Pfaff. In the semi-finals they were eliminated by Barcelona after two 1–0 defeats. These were Pfaff&#x27;s first goals conceded in the tournament (both penalties).

Beveren reached the Belgian Cup final again in 1980, after a brilliant performance by Pfaff in the return match of the semi-final against Standard. However, the cup final was surprisingly lost against underdog Thor Waterschei (1–2) and so the team was deprived of European Cup football the following season. That 1980–81 season ended in a major downer for Pfaff when he was suspended for four months by the RBFA on 11 March 1981. After all, Pfaff had allegedly kneed linesman Thirion after the cup match at home against Lokeren. In those days, the officials&#x27; report was all that mattered, but television images would later show that there was no question of a knee strike at all. After the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the 28-year old Pfaff moved to the German top club Bayern Munich for a transfer fee equivalent to 400,000 euros.

=== Bayern Munich ===
In Munich he didn&#x27;t only discovered a new football culture, but he was also exposed to the immense pressure of an absolute top club. Despite a false start in his debut match at Bremen (he underestimated one of Uwe Reinders&#x27; famous long throw-ins and rebounded the ball into his own goal), Pfaff quickly became an indispensable link in the team. Three years after the abrupt end of Sepp Maier&#x27;s career - the Bayern icon who was critically injured in a car accident, Bayern had finally found a successor for the goalkeeper for the coming years.

Although in his first season at the club, Bayern disappointed at all levels. In October, they were already knocked out in the second round of the German cup by Eintracht Braunschweig, and they finished fourth in the Bundesliga. In the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Scottish side (and eventual winners) Aberdeen proved too strong in the quarter-finals. Due to his performances in the second half of the season, Pfaff was named a &quot;world-class goalkeeper&quot; by the leading magazine Kicker in July 1983.

In the 1983-84 season Bayern finished on a fourth place again. In the second round of the UEFA Cup, Bayern drew twice 0–0 against PAOK. The penalty shootout ended when Pfaff saved Konstantinos Malioufas&#x27; attempt, and then scored Bayern&#x27;s tenth penalty himself. Nevertheless, the European adventure ended early when they were eliminated by Tottenham Hotspur in the third round. On May 31, 1984, they did win the DFB Cup after a draw in the final against Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the penalty shootout, Michael Rummenigge scored the decisive goal after Pfaff had saved Norbert Ringels&#x27; attempt.

Pfaff became champion for the first time with Bayern Munich in the 1984–85 season when they finished with a 4-point lead over Werder Bremen. The team reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup after 2 great victories against Roma, but they were eliminated by the English Everton. At home, Bayern was stuck at 0–0, and in the return match at Goodison Park they lost 1–3. The final of the DFB Pokal was reached again, but the match in the Olympiastadion in Berlin was surprisingly lost 1–2 against Bayer Uerdingen.

In the first half of the 1985–86 season, Pfaff was plagued by injuries, even lost his starting place at Bayern and had to fear that he would not be in the Belgian selection that was qualified for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. But with his iron will, he worked on his comeback and convinced all his premature critics. The competition was concluded with the same number of points as Werder Bremen (49), but with 1 more win Bayern became champions again. A cup win was also celebrated once more. The team proved to be too strong for VfB Stuttgart in the final and won easily with 5–2. Their story in the European Cup had already ended in the quarter-finals in Brussels where they lost 2–0 to Anderlecht. In the Kicker rankings, Pfaff climbed once more from &quot;international class&quot; to &quot;world class&quot;.

The 1986–87 Bundesliga was convincingly won by Bayern for the third time in a row, eventually ending with a 6 point lead over Hamburger SV. Their cup story had already ended in November after a heavy 3–0 defeat at Fortuna Düsseldorf. In the European Cup, Bayern were now able to eliminate Anderlecht with two wins this time. In the return match at the Bernabeu stadium, Real Madrid were also unable to make up for their heavy 1-4 defeat in the first leg. The final was played on 27 May 1987 in the Praterstadion, Vienna. Bayern, missing several key players due to suspensions and injuries, lost to FC Porto. For his performances with Bayern and with Belgium at the World Cup, Pfaff received the first trophy of &quot;best goalkeeper in the world&quot; in 1987 by the IFFHS.

Bayern lost the title to Werder Bremen in the 1987–88 season, finishing second. In both the German Cup and the European Cup, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals (against Hamburger SV and Real Madrid respectively). 

At the age of 35, Pfaff decided to return to his home country and signed a contract with SK Lierse. The huge difference in level with a club like Bayern did not deter him.

=== Lierse ===
The club finished in mid-table in tenth place in the 1988–89 season. After one season in Belgium, he accepted the request of his former coach Urbain Braems to join him at Trabzonspor in Turkey.

=== Trabzonspor ===
Pfaff was welcomed as a true national hero at the Turkish club. The team ended on a third place in the 1989–90 1.Lig and could qualify for the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup after they lost the final of the Turkish Cup to Beşiktaş. The Turkish Cup final turned out to be the last professional game for Pfaff, as he decided to end his 18 year long-career as a goalkeeper in 1990. Despite the increasing injury problems, he would later regret retiring at the age of 36.

==International career==
In 1976, the new Belgian coach Guy Thys decided to rejuvenate the Red Devils&#x27; selection for the 1976 European Championship. Pfaff was called up and with him other young promises such as Willy Wellens, René Verheyen and Michel Renquin. And the debut of the Beveren goalkeeper was memorable. Pfaff made his debut in the quarter finals against the Dutch team of Johan Cruijff. He did his best, intimidated Johan Neeskens in front of the Italian referee Alberto Michelotti, and made sure that he missed a penalty. The Red Devils took the lead thanks to a goal by Roger van Gool, but then the Netherlands equalized through Johnny Rep and Belgium eventually lost 1–2 after a nice lob by Cruijff. Pfaff left the field smiling and as if nothing had happened to congratulate the opponent with number fourteen. “Nobody understood me, he explained later, but Cruijff had scored a beautiful goal and my sense of sportsmanship forced me to give him a compliment.”

In the national team, Pfaff was a key player in the 1980 European Championship in Italy. It was partly thanks to the saves of the goalkeeper that Belgium reached the final against West Germany, who was lost 2–1. But Belgium was one of the emerging national teams with Pfaff as the star player.

The 1982 World Cup in Spain was much anticipated. Belgium won the tournament&#x27;s opening game against Argentina. Pfaff played at a high level, but his Spanish adventure was shorter than expected. In the third match against Hungary, he clashed with Eric Gerets and both were knocked out and forced to return home. Without the two star players, Belgium was eliminated after the second group stage. &quot;If Eric and I had not been injured, Belgium could have reached the final and... won. We would not have been afraid of anyone, not of Brazil and not of Italy.&quot;, Pfaff mentioned later.

Pfaff also defended the Belgian goal at the 1984 European Championship, a tournament in which the Red Devils did not get past the group stage and finished third in Group A behind France and Denmark. Two years later, Belgium qualified for the World Cup in Mexico. That World Cup was a highlight in the career of the Belgian goalkeeper, who became one of the great stars. Prior, Pfaff had suffered a serious injury and was competing with Jacky Munaron of Anderlecht. “When you are a regular player at Bayern again.”, coach Thys promised him, ”you will go to Mexico.”

Belgium was the surprise of the World Cup. Pfaff, who was called &#x27;El Simpatico&#x27; by the Mexican football fans, played at a high level with great saves (especially against the Soviet Union in the eighth final) and reached the semi-finals with his team. Belgium lost to Diego Maradona&#x27;s Argentina, who ended the dream of the Red Devils with two goals. &quot;The mood of the group before the match was similar to what was in the dressing room before the final of the 1980 European Championship. In both cases we were convinced that we had no chance. We also had a lot of respect for Germany and Argentina. When I see Maradona dribbling past our entire defence, I think that if there had been a man like Ludo Coeck, Diego would never have been able to achieve such a feat.&quot;
Belgium finished fourth, after losing the consolation final 4–2 to Michel Platini&#x27;s France. Upon returning home, the team was greeted by 10,000 fans who celebrated on the Grand Place in Brussels. 
Pfaff&#x27;s adventure in the national team ended in 1987, when the goalkeeper was 33 years old. He played his last international match on 23 September 1987 against Bulgaria. He was then succeeded by Michel Preud&#x27;homme.

==Style of play==

Despite his sturdy physical build, Pfaff possessed quick reflexes and was known for his spectacular playing style, as well as his ability to produce acrobatic saves, which made him an effective shot-stopper. He was also known for his extroverted and outspoken character, his lively and eccentric personality, and his strong and charismatic leadership qualities, as well as his confidence, fair-play, and professionalism, which made him an excellent organiser of the defence and a popular figure among the fans; as such, due to his cheerful attitude on the pitch and humorous demeanor, he earned him the nickname &quot;El Simpático&quot; (&quot;Mr. Nice Guy,&quot; in Spanish) during the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. He also excelled at quickly rushing off his line; moreover, although he was not the tallest goalkeeper, his large hands aided him when coming out to claim the ball, which made him an authoritative presence in goal. Furthermore, he was renowned for his penalty–stopping abilities. Despite his goalkeeping ability, however, and his reputation as one of the best goalkeepers in the world in his prime, and as one of Belgium&#x27;s greatest goalkeepers ever – with some in the sport even ranking him as one of the best goalkeepers of all time –, he was also known to be inconsistent and prone to occasional errors.

== Farewell match ==
To say goodbye to football, a farewell match was organized on the Beerschot field in 1991. The &quot;Belgium of the eighties&quot; squad faced a selection of world stars, including Franz Beckenbauer, Ruud Krol, Michel Platini, Roger Milla, Alain Giresse and Søren Lerby. The match was broadcast live in 36 countries.

==After retirement==

Pfaff had 2 short periods as a coach, first at KSV Sottegem in 1993, a few years later at Oostende (1998).

Pfaff was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was a representative of company United Sol Energy in 2005. The company became the sponsor of the former East German record champion BFC Dynamo before the 2005-06 season. Pfaff became a member of BFC Dynamo and promoted the establishment of a new youth sports school at the club. The new youth sports school at BFC Dynamo was meant to bear his name. Pfaff visited the Sportforum Hohenschönhausen and participated in training with youth teams of BFC Dynamo. However, the sponsorship never materialized. Pfaff resigned from the club on 11 August 2006 and terminated his membership. 

In 2023, a pop up museum around Pfaff opened in the former town hall of Beveren. Throughout his career, Pfaff collected a large collection of jerseys, photos and other souvenirs. After welcoming tens of thousands of visitors, the project was extended for a third time in early 2025.

<doc id="615829" wikidata="Q212854" url="?curid=615829" title="Brian Laudrup">
<text>Brian Laudrup (, born 22 February 1969) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a winger, forward or as a midfielder, and was regarded as one of the most talented players of his generation. He currently works for the various TV sports channels of Scandinavian media network, Viaplay. Laudrup also manages a football academy for marginalised youth. Brian Laudrup is the son of Danish former footballer Finn Laudrup and the younger brother of footballer Michael Laudrup.

During his playing career which eventually stalled due to injury, Laudrup represented a number of European clubs. He started with Danish club Brøndby, winning two Danish championships in the late 1980s. He then played for German and Italian clubs, winning the 1993–94 Serie A as well as the 1994 UEFA Champions League title with Milan. He was a vital part of the Rangers team which dominated the Scottish Premier Division in the 1990s, winning three championships, among others. He won the 1998 UEFA Super Cup in his brief stint with English club Chelsea, followed by a short spell with Copenhagen in Denmark, before ending his career with Ajax in 2000.

Laudrup also played 82 matches and scored 21 goals for the Denmark national team, and was a vital part of the Danish teams which won UEFA Euro 1992 and the 1995 Confederations Cup.

Laudrup won the Danish Football Player of the Year award a then record four times. It has since been beaten by Christian Eriksen who in 2018 won the award for the fifth time. Laudrup was named by FIFA as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992 and was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers at the FIFA 100 ceremony in March 2004, alongside his older brother, Michael.

==Early life==
Brian Laudrup was born into a football family – his father Finn Laudrup was a former Danish international, and his brother Michael Laudrup also became a Danish international. Brian Laudrup was born in Vienna when his father was playing for Wiener SC.

==Club career==

===Brøndby===
Laudrup began his senior career with Brøndby in Denmark. At Brøndby, he competed with later Danish internationals Claus Nielsen and Bent Christensen for a place in the starting line-up, and formed a great partnership with Nielsen. He won the 1987 and 1988 Danish First Division with the club. Halfway through the 1989 season, Laudrup&#x27;s contract with Brøndby expired, and he agreed to join German club Bayer Uerdingen. The transfer fee was thought to be around DKK 8 million, the partition of which Brøndby and Brian&#x27;s father and agent Finn Laudrup disagreed about. The Danish Football Union ruled in favor of Brøndby&#x27;s claims of around DKK 3.9 million, but the Laudrups paid around DKK 3.3 million, and insisted on not paying the remainder. The case was eventually settled in March 1990.

===Uerdingen===
Laudrup joined Uerdingen in order to play in a club with relative little pressure, and also looked to lean on fellow Dane Jan Bartram, who was already at the club. He scored 6 goals in 34 matches during the 1989–90 Bundesliga season, and impressed so much for both club and country that he was named Danish Player of the Year.

Laudrup&#x27;s performances in the Bundesliga were widely praised. At &quot;kicker&quot;&#x27;s biannual ranking of Bundesliga players, Laudrup was rated the league&#x27;s second-best forward in the second highest category, international class, after Werder Bremen&#x27;s New Zealander, Wynton Rufer. German sports magazine &quot;Sport Bild&quot; hailed Laudrup as the 1989–90 season&#x27;s best signing, ahead of high-profile names including Uwe Bein, Stefan Kuntz and Thomas Strunz.

As he felt the Uerdingen executives would not strengthen the Uerdingen team, Laudrup sought to leave the club in the summer of 1990.

===Bayern Munich===
Laudrup&#x27;s great performances in the Bundesliga and for Denmark attracted Bayern Munich for his signature, who purchased him for a DM6 million transfer fee in May 1990, making him the most expensive Bundesliga player at the time. In his first season, Laudrup scored 9 goals in 33 games as the club finished in second place. Laudrup was also part of the Bayern squad that reached the semi-final of the 1990–91 European Cup.

Laudrup was highly rated among the experts, but he was also very popular in large parts of the German population. In a vote that gave &quot;kicker&quot;-readers the opportunity to choose their favourite players at individual places and the most popular player, known as &quot;das Idol &#x27;90&quot;, was won by Laudrup with four times as many votes as Klaus Allofs in second place. By a vote of &quot;Sport Bild&quot; that 156,000 readers participated in, he received 24,245 votes and was elected the fourth best performer out of 900 candidates among German legionnaires abroad and all players in the 1. and 2. Bundesliga. Only the popular world champions Andreas Brehme, Lothar Matthäus and Rudi Völler received more votes. Laudrup finished ahead of high-profile stars like Thomas Häßler, Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Möller, Thomas Doll, Jürgen Kohler, Karl-Heinz Riedle and Matthias Sammer, and so entirely on Bundesliga players, Laudrup took first place.

Laudrup was a consistent performer in his first five matches of the 1991–92 season but suffered a cruciate ligament injury in his right knee in August 1991. Laudrup watched from the stands as the team collapsed in a disastrous season. In December 1991, Laudrup said new Bayern executives Franz Beckenbauer and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge were creating chaos in the team through their public criticism of the younger Bayern players. He returned to the team in February 1992 and played the last 15 matches of the season as Bayern finished in tenth position. Despite the injury-hit season, Laudrup still finished the 1991–92 season being named Danish Player of the Year again for the second time, and finished fifth in the FIFA World Player of the year poll.

===Fiorentina===
Laudrup&#x27;s reputation began to grow and he fulfilled his lifelong ambition when he moved to Serie A (at the time, arguably the top league in the world) to sign for Fiorentina. Fiorentina started the 1992–93 season brilliantly, playing open, flowing and attacking football in the first part of the season. However, a change of manager in the second half of the season was the beginning of the end for Fiorentina. The team as a whole produced mediocre performances, and despite the presence of such other stars as Stefan Effenberg and Gabriel Batistuta, the club was unexpectedly relegated after more than 50-straight years playing in Serie A. Despite the relegation, Laudrup himself had a fairly solid season, and was loaned to Milan for the 1993–94 season.

====Loaned to Milan====
Laudrup was loaned to Milan for the 1993–94 season, which only saw him play a handful of matches throughout the season due to a squad rotation system at the club, and also because of the three foreigner rule at the time. The world class team of Milan at the time had six other foreigners, namely Marco van Basten (unable to play due to long-term injury), Zvonimir Boban, Dejan Savićević, Jean-Pierre Papin, Florin Răducioiu, and Marcel Desailly, which meant Laudrup could play only sporadically. It was also manager Fabio Capello&#x27;s very strict system where he preferred to play more defensive type players rather than the direct play preferred by Laudrup. However, Capello&#x27;s defensive system proved to work at the end of the season, as Milan won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; only scoring 36 goals in 34 matches. Laudrup played seven European matches for the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League-winning Milan side. Despite being on contract with Fiorentina until the summer of 1996, Laudrup stated in December 1993 he did not want to return to the club.

===Rangers===
In June 1994, Laudrup was offered an escape route from Italy when he was approached by Walter Smith of Rangers. Rangers at that time were an ambitious club and had money to spend to try to seek European glory. This attracted Laudrup, and he signed for a £2.3 million transfer fee.

He made an immediate impact at Rangers. On the opening league fixture of the season against Motherwell in August 1994, it was from his precise cross that Mark Hateley headed the opening goal. In the second half with only a few minutes remaining, he provided another assist with a long run from the half-way line before passing to Duncan Ferguson, who then scored Rangers&#x27; second goal to clinch a 2–1 win. He scored his first goal for the club later that same month, in a Scottish League Cup tie against Falkirk. Although Scottish football was more physical than what he was previously used to, he excelled in the free role given to him by manager Walter Smith. Laudrup turned down an offer from Barcelona five months after signing for Rangers. He finished the season with 10 goals in 33 League games, in addition to a number of assists, as Rangers won their seventh consecutive Championship. As recognition of his fine performances, Laudrup won both the Scottish Football Writers and Scottish PFA player of the year awards. His performances for Rangers and Denmark also resulted in his winning his third Danish Player of the Year award.

Laudrup missed a run of nine League games in the early part of season 1995–96 due to an injury sustained in international duty. He returned against Celtic in November 1995 and scored Rangers&#x27; first goal in a 3–3 draw at Ibrox. He was also now playing alongside Paul Gascoigne, and the pair were instrumental in Rangers winning their eighth league championship. Laudrup also made a big impact in the latter stages of the Scottish Cup that season. He scored the winning goal in the semi-final against Celtic, playing a one-two with Gordon Durie, before taking control of the ball on his chest and chipping it over the Celtic keeper. In the final against Hearts, Rangers won 5–1. Durie scored a hat-trick, the first-ever Rangers player to do so in the final, but it was Laudrup who won the Man of the Match award, having provided assists for all three of Durie&#x27;s goals, and scoring the other two himself. The game has since become known as the &quot;Laudrup Final&quot;.

His third season at Rangers, 1996–97, saw another cup final goal, this time in a 4–3 win over Hearts in the 1996 Scottish League Cup Final. The season&#x27;s most notable concern was Rangers bid to equal Celtic&#x27;s record of nine consecutive league titles. With Rangers hampered by a series of niggling injuries to their main strikers, a greater burden for goalscoring was placed on Laudrup. He responded by scoring 16 goals in 33 league games, including the only goal against Celtic in a win in November 1996, and a headed goal in a 1–0 win in May 1997 away at Dundee United which clinched the league title and the club&#x27;s bid for nine-in-a-row. His performances saw him win the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; award once again. His great performances for Rangers and Denmark also made him win his fourth Danish player of the year.

Laudrup was linked with a £5 million move to Ajax Amsterdam in the summer of 1997, but was persuaded to stay with Rangers for one more season to help their bid for a tenth successive league title. However, despite a bright start, the season ended up an anti-climax, with Laudrup failing to match the form of previous seasons. Rangers finished runners-up in the league behind Celtic, and ended the season trophy-less after losing to Hearts in the 1998 Scottish Cup Final. Laudrup left the club shortly afterwards. He later described his time at Rangers as &quot;the four best years of my career&quot;.

===Chelsea===
Laudrup joined Chelsea in the summer of 1998. There was a possibility of Laudrup becoming a Manchester Utd player when Alex Ferguson phoned Brian about coming to Old Trafford. Laudrup said: &quot;I had to tell him that he called a day late, because I had just signed with Chelsea&quot;.

However he very quickly had reservations, and tried to get out of his contract before he even kicked a ball for Chelsea, informing them about this prior to the 1998 World Cup. Chelsea were not accommodating and told Laudrup they would go to court or involve FIFA and UEFA if the contract was not honoured.

Laudrup relented and become a Chelsea player, but was very open that he was unhappy in London and with the squad rotation system policy. &quot;I would have thought twice about signing for Chelsea if I had known,&quot; he said. He added, &quot;When I first discussed terms with Chelsea in February, nobody told me about this system if I&#x27;d known about it I would have brought it up&quot; and concluded &quot;I don&#x27;t like the system of rotation.&quot;

He made his debut as Chelsea won the 1998 UEFA Super Cup. He did not play many matches due to a combination of injury, the squad rotation system that Chelsea had where no player was guaranteed to be in the starting line up, and also because of his fall-out with the club. Laudrup provided an assist in the 4–3 victory against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park after coming off the substitutes&#x27; bench to equalize 3–3. Laudrup provided another assist in the 2–0 victory against Middlesbrough at Stamford Bridge.

Laudrup&#x27;s only Chelsea goal came in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup to give Chelsea a valuable 1–0 away win against Copenhagen to send Chelsea through to the quarter-finals. It was also his last match for the London club. Manager Gianluca Vialli had no hesitation about playing Laudrup against Copenhagen despite his unhappiness at the club, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve always had faith in Brian. I knew before the game he was having a quite difficult time with all that was going on but he&#x27;s been outstanding in training and previous matches and he responded very well. He&#x27;s been professional and the goal was the right reward for him.&quot; After the tie, he ironically moved on to Copenhagen who had negotiated a deal during the time of their two games against Chelsea.

Although Laudrup&#x27;s time at Chelsea was brief, his performances were praised, and he kept a professional attitude when called into action despite being personally unhappy in London.

Former Chelsea teammate Graham Le Saux later named Laudrup in his greatest ever XI.

===Copenhagen===
Laudrup moved back to Denmark in the spring of 1999 for a brief spell with Copenhagen. Playing for the main rivals of former club Brøndby, he was unceremoniously booed by the home fans when he revisited Brøndby Stadium in March 1999, and was also harassed by fans from other Danish clubs.

===Ajax===
Family problems resulted in Laudrup joining Ajax. Laudrup&#x27;s registration had reverted to Chelsea after leaving Copenhagen, therefore Ajax and Chelsea had to negotiate a transfer fee. He said, &quot;I had offers from 15 clubs and I have the feeling that Ajax is the right club for me. I didn&#x27;t enjoy playing with FC Copenhagen. I had the same problems there that I had with Chelsea; I could not show more than 70% of my real self.&quot; Ajax head coach Jan Wouters, who spent a season with Laudrup at Bayern Munich, added, &quot;I like Brian a lot because he can adapt and play several positions.&quot; After one individually successful season from 1999 to 2000, scoring 15 goals in 38 matches, Laudrup could not play another season due to injuries. He was forced to retire from top-level football at age 31 after one of the most successful careers in Danish football.

==International career==
Laudrup made his international debut for the Denmark under-17 team in July 1984, and played six matches for the team until October that year. From October 1985 to August 1987, he played 12 matches and scored 6 goals for the under-19 team. He also represented the under-21s in five games from June 1987 to November 1988. He was called up for the senior Denmark national team by coach Sepp Piontek in April 1987 as a replacement for his brother Michael, but did not receive his debut.

===Senior debut===
Laudrup was included in the senior Danish &quot;Olympic national team&quot; of under-21 coach Richard Møller Nielsen, and took part in three qualification matches for the 1988 Summer Olympics. He made his debut on 18 November 1987, at age 18, in a 1–0 defeat to West Germany, with Bjarne Goldbæk also debuting in that match. Laudrup scored his first national team goal in his third game, a 4–0 win against Greece on 20 April 1988. He was then included as a part of coach Piontek&#x27;s selection ahead of the UEFA Euro 1988. He came on as a substitute in a friendly match against Austria in April 1988, but broke his collarbone just before the final Euro 1988 squad was named.

Laudrup was recalled to the senior national team in February 1989, and became a mainstay in the team under new national team coach Richard Møller Nielsen. He scored three goals in four matches as Denmark narrowly missed qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. During the dispute with Brøndby over his transfer fee, it was discussed whether the Danish Football Union should ban Laudrup from the national team. Following three matches in the qualification campaign for the Euro 1992, Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 alongside his brother Michael and Jan Bartram, as he lacked respect for coach Nielsen.

===European champion at Euro 1992===
Laudrup returned to the national team under coach Nielsen in April 1992. In 1992, Laudrup travelled with the Danish national team to Euro 1992 in Sweden, and in a strictly defensive strategy, Laudrup was one of the few attacking players. Though he did not score a single goal in the competition, his skill and speed was an important part of the Danish team that went on to win the tournament, and Laudrup was voted a shared fifth in the 1992 FIFA World Player of the Year poll, with fellow Dane Peter Schmeichel, though he had the edge over Schmeichel in the domestic polls, where Laudrup won his second Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award in 1992.

Laudrup scored 2 goals in 12 matches as Denmark were edged out of participation at the 1994 World Cup by Spain and the Republic of Ireland. During the World Cup qualification, Michael Laudrup had re-entered the team.

===Confederations Cup 95 success===
Laudrup was a vital part of the Danish team that won the Confederations Cup in 1995. He scored a remarkable individual goal in the 2–0 win over Saudi Arabia which saw him beat three defenders before slotting it into the net from a wide angle. The goal is rated by FIFA as one of the greatest goals ever scored in the history of the competition. Denmark defeated Argentina in the final 2–0, with Laudrup providing an excellent dribble down the wing to assist in the second goal. Laudrup won the Golden Ball award naming him the best player of the tournament.

===Euro 1996 participation===
Laudrup helped Denmark qualify for Euro 1996, though the tournament was a disappointment for the defending champions. Laudrup was a highlight for the Danes scoring three goals in as many matches, including two against Turkey, but the team was eliminated in the preliminary group stage.

===World Cup 98 participation===
With four goals in seven matches, Laudrup was an important part of the Danish team that qualified for the 1998 World Cup, the only World Cup of his career. He shone at the tournament, scoring two goals and gathering three assists. He saw Denmark through to the quarter-finals with a goal in the 4–1 surprise thrashing of Nigeria in the first knock-out round. The quarter-final was his last match for Denmark, where they were defeated 3–2 by eventual runners-up Brazil, despite Laudrup setting-up the first goal to make it 1–0, and scoring to the top near corner of the goal to level the match at 2–2. Until the Brazil match, when Laudrup had scored for Denmark, they had never lost.

The quarter-final was the best ever Danish result at a World Cup, and Laudrup later ranked the 1998 Denmark team higher than the Euro 1992-winning side. He was named as one of the 16 players selected by FIFA as the &quot;All Star Team&quot; of the World Cup, alongside his brother Michael. After the tournament, Laudrup decided to end his national team career, having played in 82 matches, scoring 21 goals over the course of 11 years.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Laudrup was an elegant, technical and creative player who was gifted with tremendous pace and ball control. He used this talent, offensive capabilities and acceleration to dribble at speed and beat players with relative ease to create openings for teammates. Although he was a powerful and accurate striker of the ball, who was capable of finishing well and scoring with either foot as well as with his head, Laudrup was also known to be a very unselfish player with excellent vision who would often take more pleasure in setting-up teammates rather than going for goal himself. Regarding Laudrup&#x27;s unselfishness, John Greig commented: &quot;Apart from applying the ammunition, Laudrup was also capable of scoring his share of goals, but I genuinely believe that he was embarrassed about scoring. He seemed to derive much more pleasure from making goals&quot;. A versatile player, Laudrup was capable of playing in several attacking and midfield positions; his preferred position was in a free role, as a winger on either flank, or in the centre, as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, with licence to roam. He was also deployed as a midfielder, as a deep-lying forward, or even as a striker on occasion throughout his career. Despite his skill and ability, his consistency and mentality was occasionally brought into question throughout his career.

===Reception===
Laudrup has been praised by several players, managers, pundits, and footballing figures for his footballing ability, including Charlie Nicholas, Roland Wohlfarth, Ally McCoist, and Andy Goram. Franz Beckenbauer described Laudrup as &quot;a world class player,&quot; a view shared by Andreas Brehme, who described him as a &quot;player of the highest quality class.&quot; Paul Gascoigne instead dubbed him an &quot;amazing player.&quot; Laudrup&#x27;s older brother, Michael, likened Brian&#x27;s playing style to his own, and even believed his younger brother to be superior to himself. His former manager Horst Wohlers named him as the best player he had ever coached, and as the top footballer in the Bundesliga during their time together at Bayer Uerdingen. In December 2013, Graeme Le Saux named Luís Figo and Brian Laudrup as his toughest opponents ever. Walter Smith&#x27;s view of Laudrup was more critical however, lauding his ability but also lamenting his mentality, which he believed limited him as a player, commenting: &quot;Brian Laudrup is as good a player as I have ever worked with, but he frustrated me. He had the capability of being up there with the greatest players of all time. There was just that little bit in him mentally that stopped him from being right at the very top. Make no mistake, he was a fantastic player for us, but he could have elevated himself into a position where he was one of the best in the world.&quot;

==Career after football==
Laudrup now works as a pundit and co-commentator for Discovery Networks Denmark, covering the Premier League and Denmark national team. He formerly covered the UEFA Champions League in the same role for Danish TV3+.

He is also involved with the so-called &quot;Laudrup &amp; Høgh ProCamp&quot;, a youth football camp, co–coached with former national team goalkeeper Lars Høgh.

In his spare time, he played for Lyngby BK&#x27;s Old Boys side alongside Michael Laudrup.

==Personal life==
Laudrup is married to Mette and has a son, Nicolai, and a daughter, Rasmine.

On 7 September 2010, he announced that he had lymphoma and was undergoing treatment. Three months after the start of the treatment, he was told there were no signs of the disease.

<text>Franz Eduard Graf von Tottleben (, tr. ; – ), better known as Eduard Totleben in English, was a Baltic German military engineer and Imperial Russian Army general. He was in charge of fortification and sapping work during a number of important Russian military campaigns.

==Early life==
Totleben was born at Mitau in Courland (now Jelgava, Latvia). His parents were of Thuringian descent and originated in Tottleben, belonging to the Baltic German noble Tottleben family (also spelled &quot;Totleben&quot; or &quot;Todleben&quot;), but had since become merchants. Eduard himself was intended for commerce, but instead sought a career as a military engineer. He entered the school of engineers at Saint Petersburg (now the Military Engineering-Technical University).

==Military career==

===Early military career===
Totleben joined the Imperial Russian Army in 1836. He saw active service as captain of engineers in the campaigns against Imam Shamil in the Caucasus, beginning in 1848 for two years.

===Crimean War===
At the outbreak of war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire in 1853, Totleben took part in the siege of Silistria, and after the siege was raised was transferred to the Crimea. In September 1854, an Anglo-French-Ottoman army landed in the Crimea with the aim of taking Sevastopol, the principal base of the Russian Black Sea fleet. Sevastopol, while strongly fortified toward the sea, was almost unprotected on the land side.

Totleben, though still a junior field officer, coordinated the defense. On his advice the Black Sea fleet was sunk, in order to block the mouth of the harbour, and the deficiency of fortifications on the land side was made good before the allies could take advantage of it. The construction of earthworks and redoubts was carried out in extreme haste and much of the artillery from the warships was transferred to them. Totleben originated the idea that a fortress should be considered not a walled town but an entrenched position, intimately connected with the offensive and defensive capacities of an army and as susceptible to alteration as the formation of troops in battle or manoeuvre.

Until 20 June 1855, Totleben conducted operations for the defense at Sevastopol in person; he was then wounded in the foot and was not present at the operations which immediately preceded the fall of the fortress. In the course of the siege he had risen from the rank of lieutenant-colonel to that of lieutenant-general, and had also been made aide-de-camp to the tsar. When he recovered he was employed in strengthening the fortifications at the mouth of the Dnieper, and also those of Kronstadt. In 1864, he suggested further improvements of the Brest Fortress that were implemented between then and 1868.

On 24 March 1854, Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote to Totleben asking for his help in returning to European Russia. Dostoyevsky had been sentenced to four years of banishment in Siberia. Totleben&#x27;s brother Adolf had been Dostoyevsky&#x27;s classmate at the school of military engineering in Saint Petersburg.

===Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78===
In 1860 Totleben was appointed assistant to Grand Duke Nicholas, and he subsequently became head of the department of engineers with the full rank of general. He received no command when another war against the Ottoman Empire began in 1877. Only after the early Russian reverses before Plevna was he called to the front. He saw that it would be necessary to draw engineering works around Osman Pasha and cut him off from communication with the other Turkish commanders. In due time, Plevna fell. Totleben then undertook the siege of the Bulgarian fortresses. After the conclusion of the preliminaries of peace, he was placed in command of the whole Russian army.

==Later life==
After the war Totleben was assigned to be Governor General of Bessarabia and Novorossiya. He also became a hereditary Count. In 1880, he held the post of Governor General of Vilna. He died in 1884 at Bad Soden near Frankfurt am Main, and is buried in Sevastopol.

The village of Totleben in Pordim Municipality, Pleven Province, is named after him, in honour of his decisive role in the Siege of Plevna of 1877.

<doc id="615832" wikidata="Q508711" url="?curid=615832" title="Didier Deschamps">
<text>Didier Claude Deschamps (; born 15 October 1968) is a French professional football manager and former player who has been managing the France national team since 2012. He played as a defensive midfielder for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, namely Marseille, Juventus, Chelsea and Valencia, as well as Nantes and Bordeaux. Nicknamed &quot;the water-carrier&quot; (), Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a French international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three UEFA European Football Championships and one FIFA World Cup, captaining his nation to victories in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

In addition to winning two Division 1 titles in 1990 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the Marseille squad that became the first, and so far only, French club to win the UEFA Champions League, a feat which the team achieved in 1993; with the Champions League victory, Deschamps became the youngest captain ever to lead his team to win the title. With Juventus he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup, as well as three Serie A titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the 1999–2000 FA Cup, and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in 2001, before retiring later that season. After Franz Beckenbauer and followed by Iker Casillas, he was only the second captain in the history of football to have lifted the Champions League trophy, the World Cup trophy, and the European Championship trophy.

As a manager, Deschamps began his career with Monaco, and helped the club to win the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003, and reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, being named Ligue 1 Manager of the Year in 2004. During the 2006–07 season, he helped his former club Juventus win the Serie B title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli Scandal the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the 2009–10 season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive Trophée des Champions titles in 2010 and 2011.

On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the France national team. He led the team to the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the final of UEFA Euro 2016, victory in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a back-to-back final appearance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Upon winning the World Cup in 2018, Deschamps became the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, alongside Mário Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer—both of whom died in January 2024 two days apart, leaving Deschamps the only living man to have reached the milestone. Deschamps follows Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain.

==Club career==
Deschamps was born in Bayonne in the French part of the Basque Country. After a short passage at rugby in the Biarritz Olympique club, Deschamps started his football career at an amateur club, Aviron Bayonnais whilst still at school. His potential was spotted by scouts from Nantes, for whom he signed in April 1983. Deschamps made his league debut on 27 September 1985. He transferred to Marseille in 1989. Deschamps then spent a season on loan with Bordeaux in 1990, before returning to Marseille. In this second spell with Marseille, Deschamps gained his first honours as a professional player, winning two Division 1 titles in 1991 and 1992, and was a member of the first and only French side to win the Champions League in 1993, becoming the youngest captain ever to lift the trophy in the process.

In 1994, Deschamps joined Italian club Juventus, with whom he won three Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana, as well as his second Champions League title, a UEFA Super Cup, and an Intercontinental Cup in 1996; he also reached two more Champions League finals in his next two seasons, and a UEFA Cup final in 1995. After his spell with Juventus, Deschamps spent a season in England with Chelsea, winning the FA Cup, and scoring once against Hertha BSC in the Champions League. He finished his playing career in Spain, spending a season with Valencia, helping them to the 2001 UEFA Champions League final, but he remained on the bench as they lost to Bayern Munich. He then retired in the middle of 2001, only 32 years old.

==International career==
Receiving his first international call-up from Michel Platini on 29 April 1989 against Yugoslavia, Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the France national team as they failed to qualify for the World Cup in both 1990 and 1994, also suffering a first-round elimination at UEFA Euro 1992.

When new team coach Aimé Jacquet began to rebuild the team for Euro 96, he initially selected Manchester United star Eric Cantona as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, Jean-Pierre Papin, and David Ginola being dropped in favour of younger players such as Zinedine Zidane. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the &quot;Golden Generation&quot;. He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against Germany as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the 1986 World Cup.

In 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won the 1998 World Cup on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won Euro 2000, giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, a feat emulated and surpassed by the Spain national team between 2008 and 2012. Following the tournament, Deschamps announced his retirement from international football, making his second last appearance in a ceremonial match against a FIFA XI in August 2000, which resulted in 5–1 victory. His final appearance was against England. At the time of his retirement Deschamps held the record for the most appearances for France, though this has since been surpassed by Hugo Lloris, Zinedine Zidane, Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann, Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry. In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals.

Deschamps was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.

== Style of play ==
In his position, Deschamps primarily excelled at impeding the opposition&#x27;s attacking movements as a defensive midfielder, and so was capable of starting up attacking plays and distributing the ball to teammates once he won back possession, leading to him being derisively nicknamed &quot;the water-carrier&quot; by former France teammate Eric Cantona, who implied that Deschamps&#x27;s primary contribution to the national team was to retrieve the ball and pass it forward to &quot;more talented&quot; players. Deschamps&#x27;s ability to perform this role was made possible due to his high work-rate, tenacity, stamina, vision, reliable distribution and technique, and his efficacy at pressing and tackling opponents. He also had an excellent positional and organisational sense, and was known for his tactical intelligence, versatility, and his leadership as a footballer.

== Managerial career ==

===Monaco===
After retiring as a player, he went into football management. He was appointed head coach of Monaco in France&#x27;s Ligue 1, leading the club to the Coupe de la Ligue title in 2003 and to its first UEFA Champions League final in 2004. He resigned on 19 September 2005 after a poor start to the season, and disagreement with the club&#x27;s president.

===Juventus===
On 10 July 2006, Deschamps was named head coach of Juventus, after Fabio Capello resigned in the wake of the Calciopoli scandal. Deschamps&#x27; first game in charge of Juventus was highly successful since Juventus beat Alessandria 8–0 in a friendly, but poor results followed as Juventus were knocked out in the third round of the Coppa Italia and then drew 1–1 against Rimini on the first day of the league season. In the following three matches, Juventus beat Vicenza 2–1, Crotone 3–0 and Modena 4–0. Deschamps also helped Juventus to win their first competition since being relegated, which was the Birra Moretti Cup in which Juventus beat Internazionale 1–0 and Napoli in a penalty shoot-out. He led Juventus to its return to Serie A, which was confirmed on 19 May 2007 with a 5–1 away win at Arezzo. On 26 May, several media announced Deschamps had resigned as Juventus manager, following several clashes with the club management. However, this was denied by the club itself a few hours later. Later that evening, after the game against Mantova, which confirmed Juve as Serie B champions, Deschamps confirmed to the media that he had indeed resigned and the news was then made official by Juventus a few hours later.

===Marseille===
On 5 May 2009, it was announced that Deschamps would be named manager of Marseille to the upcoming season which began on 1 July 2009. In his first season, he managed them to their first Ligue 1 title in 18 years. His success had seen the Marseille manager linked to a return to Juventus, whose former president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli urged the club to bring back Deschamps to replace Ciro Ferrara. Ferrara was eventually replaced by Alberto Zaccheroni. On 29 June 2010, Deschamps signed a contract extension that would keep him at Marseille until June 2012. On 6 June 2011, he extended his contract again, this time until June 2014. On 13 March 2012, his Marseille side progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 1993 by beating Inter Milan. On 14 April 2012, Marseille won the Coupe de la Ligue for third time in a row after they beat Lyon 1–0 with Brandão scoring in extra-time. The victory also ended a winless run of 12 matches in all competitions. Deschamps was delighted with Marseille&#x27;s Coupe de la Ligue triumph and added: &quot;All title wins are beautiful, as they are difficult to achieve. This is the sixth in three years. For a club that had not won anything for 17 years, it is something to be proud of. The credit goes mostly to the players, but I also want to associate my staff with the victory. This is a great source of pride for me, even if it does not change the fact it has been a difficult season in Ligue 1.&quot; On 2 July 2012, Deschamps left the club by mutual agreement, citing their poor finish of tenth place in 2011–12.

===France===
On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was appointed as head coach of the France national football team on a two-year contract, following in the footsteps of France teammate Laurent Blanc, who resigned after the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament.

France was placed in UEFA Group I for the qualification phase of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. UEFA Group I contained the defending world champions Spain, plus Belarus, Finland and Georgia. In that group, France earned a 1–1 draw away in the first match against Spain but lost 1–0 at home against the same opponents in the second match. After the 1–0 defeat by Spain, France failed to score a single goal in its next four matches – against Uruguay (friendly, 1–0), Brazil (friendly, 3–0), Belgium (friendly, 0–0) and Georgia (Group I qualifying match, 0–0). France finished second in the group, three points behind Spain, and thus had to win the two-legged play-off tie against Ukraine to advance to the final phase of the tournament. In the first leg held in Kyiv, France was beaten 2–0 by Ukraine. Coming into the second leg, Ukraine had kept eight consecutive clean sheets and had not lost their last 12 matches. In the second leg held at the Stade de France, France beat Ukraine 3–0 to win the tie 3–2 on aggregate. France thus qualified for the final phase of the FIFA World Cup for the fifth consecutive time. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Deschamps&#x27;s team advanced to the quarter-finals where they lost 1–0 to eventual champions Germany, and Paul Pogba was named Best Young Player of the tournament.

On 20 November 2013, Deschamps extended his contract to coach the France national team until the UEFA Euro 2016. The extension was triggered under the terms of an agreement reached with the French Football Federation (FFF) when Deschamps replaced Laurent Blanc after the UEFA Euro 2012, whereby qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup would earn Deschamps the right to lead France until the Euro 2016 to be held in France.

At Euro 2016, Deschamps led France to the final on 7 July after a brace from Antoine Griezmann helped defeat Germany 2–0. In the final, France were defeated 1–0 after extra time by Portugal.

On 31 October 2017, Deschamps signed a new contract until 2020.

For the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Deschamps &quot;was careful in selecting his 23-man roster for Russia, selecting only players who he felt could gel as a cohesive unit&quot;, resulting in the omission of Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema. Although initially criticized for conservative tactics as the national team had indifferent showings to advance from the group stage with narrow wins over Australia and Peru and a draw against Denmark, they put in dominant performances during the knockout rounds, defeating Argentina 4–3 in the round of 16, and Uruguay 2–0 in the quarter-finals to reach the semi-finals. Following these matches, France became World Cup winners after beating Belgium 1–0 in the semi-final and Croatia 4–2 in the final. As such, Deschamps became only the third man after Mário Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, and only the second captain after Beckenbauer to do so.

In December 2019, Deschamps signed a new contract with France, keeping him with the national team until World Cup 2022. At the Euro 2020, France were knocked out on penalties by Switzerland in the round of 16, following a 3–3 draw. Deschamps was criticized for getting his team selections and tactics wrong. In the 2022 World Cup, he led France to reach their second final in a row, which they lost 4–2 on penalties to Argentina after a 3–3 draw. In January 2023, he extended his contract with France until June 2026.

France secured their place in UEFA Euro 2024 by finishing at the top of their qualifying group, achieving seven wins and one draw. In one of the matches, France beat Gibraltar 14–0, marking the largest victory in their history.

France began the competition well with a 1–0 win over Austria. However, their captain Kylian Mbappé sustained a broken nose during the match. They made it to the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain.

In January 2025, Deschamps announced that he would not extend his contract when it expires after the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

== Style of management==
Deschamps first made a name for himself with Monaco as one of the best tacticians in Europe during the team&#x27;s 2003–04 Champions League run, with his counter-attacking style.

Due to his successes with the France national team, Deschamps is known for being an astute tournament manager and setting teams up with a solid foundation and work ethic. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris describes him as being &quot;calm and collected&quot; which transmits to the players. He also brings understanding and pragmatism, common sense and adaptability; the same qualities that served him so well as a player in midfields with more glamorous talents.

During the 2018 World Cup, Deschamps used holding midfielder Blaise Matuidi in a new role, playing him out wide, rather than in the centre, as a left-sided defensive winger or attacking midfielder in a fluid 4–2–3–1 formation. In this system, helped provide balance to the team by covering the left flank defensively, thus limiting the attacking threat of the opposing full-backs. This in turn gave Kylian Mbappé the licence to attack and run at defences from the right wing. Moreover, Matuidi often tucked into the centre of the pitch, in order to provide defensive support to playmaker Paul Pogba in midfield, along with N&#x27;Golo Kanté, and help reduce spaces in their opponents&#x27; midfield. Deschamps also used centre-forward Olivier Giroud as a false-9 who used his physicality to create space and chances for forwards Antoine Griezmann and Mbappé, giving them the freedom to generate opportunities and score, in a similar manner to Stéphane Guivarc&#x27;h, who was Deschamps&#x27;s teammate in the victorious French 1998 World Cup side. However, his pragmatic and defensive style drew criticism from several Belgian players following France&#x27;s semi-final victory in the tournament.

During the 2022 World Cup, due to injuries to several of the French team&#x27;s key midfielders, Deschamps used Griezmann in a deeper role, as a central midfielder, in which he excelled, due to his vision, work-rate, and ability to link the defence and the attack.

Deschamps places significant importance on creating a cohesive team environment by developing positive relationships with his players; he also believes in the importance of his players&#x27; personalities, and how they gel with one another. He also likes to lead by example in his professional relationships with his staff and players. While he believes in controlling possession, he stresses the importance of transitions during matches in particular. Tactically, Deschamps likes to let matches unfold without giving instructions to his players from the bench, and does not believe in being overly controlling with his players. He likes to observe the match and discuss any possible changes with his staff.

==Personal life==
Deschamps married Claude Antoinette in 1989. Together they have a son, Dylan, who was born in 1996. He was raised a Catholic. Deschamps&#x27; brother Philippe died in a plane crash when Deschamps was 19 years old which he said has &quot;marked [his] life&quot;.

He is first cousin with retired professional tennis player and 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat.

<text>Just Louis Fontaine (18 August 193328 February 2023) was a French professional footballer who played as a striker. He scored the most goals ever in a single edition of the FIFA World Cup, with thirteen in six matches in the 1958 tournament. In March 2004, Pelé named him one of his 125 Greatest Living Footballers at a FIFA Awards Ceremony.

==Football career==
Born in Marrakech, French Morocco, to a French father and a Spanish mother, Fontaine moved to Casablanca, where he attended the Lycée Lyautey.

Fontaine began his amateur career at USM Casablanca, where he played from 1950 to 1953. Nice recruited him in 1953, and he went on to score 44 goals in three seasons for the club. In 1956, he moved to Stade de Reims, where he teamed up with Raymond Kopa from the 1959–60 season. Fontaine scored 121 goals in six seasons at Stade de Reims. In total, Fontaine scored 165 goals in 200 matches in the Division 1, and won the championship twice, one time in 1958, and the other in 1960. He also took part in the team that got to the 1958–59 European Cup final against Real Madrid, being that season&#x27;s top scorer with ten goals.

Wearing the blue shirt of France, Fontaine has an even more impressive record. On his debut on 17 December 1953, Fontaine scored a hat trick as France defeated Luxembourg 8–0. In seven years, he scored 30 goals in 21 matches. However, he will best be remembered for his 1958 FIFA World Cup performance, where he scored 13 goals in just six matches – a feat that included putting four past defending champions West Germany. It is also the highest number of goals ever scored by one player at a single World Cup tournament. This tally secured him the Golden Boot. , he is tied with Lionel Messi as the fourth-top scorer in FIFA World Cup history, with each of the three ahead of him - Gerd Müller (14 goals), Ronaldo (15 goals) and Miroslav Klose (16 goals) - having played in at least two tournaments.

Fontaine played his last match in July 1962, being forced to retire early (28 years and 11 months old) because of a recurring leg injury. He briefly managed the France national team in 1967, but was replaced after only two friendly games, which ended in defeats. As coach of Morocco, he led the Atlas Lions to a third place finish in the 1980 African Cup of Nations, overseeing the emergence of such players as Badou Zaki, Mohammed Timoumi and Aziz Bouderbala. Morocco reached the final stage of 1982 World Cup qualifying but were beaten by Cameroon. As sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain F.C., he managed to help promote the club to the first division.

==After retirement==
Fontaine was named by Pelé as one of the 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was chosen as the best French player of the last 50 years by the French Football Federation in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003. With Eugène N&#x27;Jo Léa he founded the National Union of Professional Football Players in 1961. He criticized the performance of the French team in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, particularly on the lackluster play of the forwards. Fontaine died in Toulouse, where he had lived for 60 years, on 28 February 2023 at the age of 89.

<doc id="615836" wikidata="Q123118" url="?curid=615836" title="Raymond Kopa">
<text>Raymond Kopa (né Kopaszewski; 13 October 1931 – 3 March 2017) was a French professional footballer, integral to the France national team of the 1950s. At club level he was part of the legendary Real Madrid team of the 1950s, winning three European Cups.

Considered one of the greatest players of all-time, Kopa was a forward or an attacking midfielder who was quick, agile and known for his dribbling, playmaking, and prolific scoring. In 1958, Kopa was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or. In 1970, he became the first football player to receive the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 2004, Pelé named him one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers at a FIFA Awards Ceremony.

==Early life==
Kopa was born to a family of Polish immigrants. His grandparents were originally from Kraków and migrated to Germany, where his parents were born. They then migrated to France after the First World War.

His surname was shortened to Kopa from Kopaszewski while he was at school. He acquired French nationality at his majority in 1952. At the age of 14, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, father and brother by working in the coal mines of Nœux-les-Mines. During this time Kopa lost a finger in a mining accident.

==Personal life==
Kopa married Christiane, the sister of a teammate of his at Angers. After retiring from the game he launched his own sportswear brand, eventually settling in Corsica. Kopa died in Angers on 3 March 2017, aged 85.

Kopa was mentored by Paul Sinibaldi. Sinibaldi was the godfather to Kopa&#x27;s son.

==Career==
After finishing second in the French national youth football trials in 1949, Kopa began his professional career at age 17 with Angers in Ligue 2 and was transferred two years later to Reims, with whom he won French championships in 1953 and 1955. He won the 1953 Latin Cup with Reims, where they defeated Milan 3–0 in the final, and helped them reach the 1956 European Cup Final, which the team lost to Alfredo Di Stéfano&#x27;s Real Madrid, 4–3.

Kopa had first attracted attention in Spain when he played for France against Spain in a match in Madrid in March 1955, after which the Spanish sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; nicknaming him &quot;Little Napoleon&quot;. Kopa was transferred to Real Madrid for the 1956–57 season, where he was soon joined by Ferenc Puskás. Despite playing as an inside right at Real Madrid rather than as the no. 10, his usual position, Kopa helped the club to three successive European cup victories and the Spanish league title in 1957 and 1958. Kopa was also the first French player to win the European Cup when Madrid defeated Fiorentina 2–0 in the 1957 final. He would go on to be European champion again in 1958 and 1959, the latter against former side Reims, where Just Fontaine was playing. In the 1959–60 season, Kopa returned to France to finish his career with Reims, where he won further &quot;Championnats&quot; in 1960 and 1962. In total, he scored 75 goals in 346 matches in France&#x27;s top flight, and was awarded the &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot; by &quot;France Football&quot; in 1958.

With the France national team, Kopa scored 18 goals in 45 matches between 1952 and 1962. He played in the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, scoring three goals as he led France to the semi-finals, where they succumbed to a strong Brazil team. The French team finished third in the tournament.

In March 2004, Kopa was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers. In 2018, France Football&#x27;s Kopa Trophy, awarded to the best young football player in the calendar year was named in Raymond&#x27;s honor. The first recipient was fellow Frenchman Kylian Mbappé.

<doc id="615838" wikidata="Q13494" url="?curid=615838" title="Jean-Pierre Papin">
<text>Jean-Pierre Roger Guillaume Papin (; born 5 November 1963) is a French football manager and former professional player who played as a forward, who is currently the head coach of Championnat National 3 club Marseille B. He won the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1991.

Papin was included in the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest living footballers, published in 2004 for the centenary of the FIFA, signed by Pelé. He was named one of the best European footballers on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the UEFA in 2004. He is famous in particular for his first-time strikes from distance, his overhead kicks, and his volleys, which are known as &quot;Papinades&quot;. The nickname of JPP was given to him by supporters and journalists.

Trained at Jeumont, Papin signed his first professional contract in 1984 at Valenciennes. Recruited by Brugge, he won the Belgian Cup and went on to be selected for the French team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Signed by Marseille, he experienced the pinnacle of his career as he won Ligue 1 titles with Marseille in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, the Coupe de France in 1989 and reached the final of the UEFA Champions League in 1991. In 1992, he left Olympique de Marseille for AC Milan in a record transfer; he won Serie A in 1994 and the UEFA Champions League. He joined Bayern Munich, where he won the UEFA Cup in 1996. He returned to France, to Bordeaux, where he was a finalist in the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 1998 and then ended his professional career at Guingamp.

Capped 54 times, and captained 11 times, Papin played in the French team which reached the 1986 World Cup Semi final. France failed to qualify for either the 1988 European Championships or the 1990 World Cup but he was part of the team for Euro 1992. Injuries and the emergence of the Zinedine Zidane generation saw his international career come to an end in the mid-1990s. He was out of favour by Euro&#x27;96 nor was he part of the set up which won the World Cup in 1998.

In 1996, after their eight-month-old daughter was shown to have serious cerebral lesions, Jean-Pierre and his wife set up an association &quot;Neuf de Coeur&quot; (Nine of Hearts; Papin&#x27;s shirt number was 9) to help others in that situation and, particularly, to find and apply methods to mentally and physically educate such children.

== Early life ==
Jean-Pierre Roger Guillaume Papin was born on 5 November 1963 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais, the son of professional footballer Guy Papin. After his parents divorced, he moved to live with his grandmother in Germont, a French city located near the Belgian border.

== Club career ==
=== Valenciennes ===
At age 15, Papin started his professional career with Valenciennes, in Northern France, before moving to Club Brugge in Belgium.

Papin had a very successful first season at Club Brugge, scoring 32 goals in 43 games. Although he only played one season for Club Brugge, he was elected as its greatest ever foreign player by the supporters in 2008.

=== Marseille ===
During Papin&#x27;s hugely successful spell at Marseille, with the Frenchman as striker and skipper Marseille won four French league championships in a row (1989–1992), a league and cup double in 1989 and reached the final of the European Cup in 1991, losing to Red Star Belgrade on penalties.

During this period, Papin scored 181 goals in 279 games and was the league&#x27;s top scorer for five consecutive seasons (from 1988 to 1992). While at Marseille he won the Ballon d&#x27;Or, awarded to Europe&#x27;s top footballer, in 1991.

=== AC Milan ===
In July 1992, Papin joined Italian giants AC Milan for a world record fee of £10 million, and was the first high-profile French player to join the Italian league since Michel Platini. However, he never established himself as a regular first team member with the &quot;rossoneri&quot; due to injuries and adaptation problems. As a foreign player in the Pre-Bosman rule era, Papin also suffered from the three-foreigner rule that made him compete for playing time with other foreign players.

He entered as a substitute during the 1993 Champions League final in which Milan lost to his former club, Marseille. He won the Champions League in the next year, but did not play in the final. Nevertheless, Papin has kept good memories of his spell in Italy and frequently cites former Milan managers Fabio Capello and Arrigo Sacchi as his models when coaching is concerned.

=== Bayern Munich ===
In 1994, he was transferred to Bayern Munich for £2.1 million, but his first season was once again plagued by injuries. In his second season in Germany he was part of the side that won the UEFA Cup against Bordeaux, a club that Papin would join the following season. He was twice linked with clubs in England later in his playing career. First, in March 1994, he was a transfer target for Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur. Towards the end of his spell with Bordeaux in 1998, he was a target for ambitious Fulham, then a Division Two (third tier) side, and even expressed his desire to sign for the club. However, neither transfer ever happened and Papin finished his career without having spent any time in England.

=== Bordeaux ===
With Bordeaux, he lost the 1997 Coupe de la Ligue final against Strasbourg and lost the 1998 Coupe de la Ligue final.

=== Guingamp ===
Papin&#x27;s professional career ended in 1998 with Second Division side Guingamp.

=== Later career ===
Papin finished his career as a player in the amateur club US Cap-Ferret between 2001 and 2004. Then, after five years of managing, he played in another amateur club, AS Facture-Biganos Boïen.

== International career ==
Papin was selected for the first time in the French team during the Toulon Tournament in 1985 in Marseille with the number 14, alongside Pascal Baills, Stéphane Paille, Gérald Passi, Franck Sauzée, Vincent Cobos and Jean-Christophe Thomas. The France team won the Toulon Tournament and successively defeated Spain (Jon Andoni Goikoetxea), Romania (Gheorghe Popescu), Ivory Coast (Joël Tiéhi) and England (Martin Allen). Papin finished as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer and it was during the match against Spain that Papin scored his first official goal at the Stade Vélodrome.

Papin earned his first cap in a friendly match against Northern Ireland in February 1986 and appeared at the 1986 World Cup. He scored twice in four games: first during France opening game against Canada (1–0) and then during France&#x27;s victory against Belgium (4–2), helping France finish third.

He did not appear at the 1990 World Cup because France failed to qualify, but during the qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 1992 he finished second top scorer in the Qualifiers of the 1992 European Football Championship with nine goals behind Darko Pančev and the France team is the only one to win all its playoff matches, a first in Europe and this in a very strong group with two quarter-finalists of the previous World Cup, Spain and Czechoslovakia. Papin who suffers from the aftermath of an ankle injury cannot prevent France from failing in the first round, despite scoring two goals in three games

The French football team, trained by Gérard Houllier, played in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers but got off to a bad start (2–0 defeat in Bulgaria), but a series of 6 wins against Austria (twice), Finland (twice), Sweden and Israel put them back at the top of the group and in a very favorable position for qualification with three rounds to go. The French team, undermined by internal quarrels (Marseille-Paris rivalry), however collapsed in the final sprint by conceding a draw in Sweden (1–1 on a defensive error three minutes from the end) and during the two last games played at home, where they only had to beat Israel or not lose against Bulgaria, to score the ticket for the United States. The Blues lost against the weakest team in the group, Israel (2–3 on a goal by Atar 30 seconds from the end of the match), then against Bulgaria (1–2 on a goal by Emil Kostadinov two seconds the end of regulation time), this goal depriving France of participation in the World Cup. The two qualifiers of this group 6, Sweden and Bulgaria, would reach the semi-finals of the World Cup in July 1994.

Papin initially said goodbye to the Blues of which he was the captain after the elimination in qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, before being convinced by Aimé Jacquet to return. He scored his last goal in selection at Trebizond in Turkey (match relocated because of troubles in Azerbaijan) against Azerbaijan (2–0) at the end of 1994. Papin played his last international match against the Netherlands in January 1995, before injuries and the emergence of the Zinédine Zidane generation permanently removed him from the selection.

== Style of play ==
Papin has been described as &quot;a fast and lethal striker, who made goal scoring his signature for club and country&quot; and a player who could score in a variety of situation, &quot;from neat, chipped finishes, low drives into the corner, towering headers and, in particular, thumping volleys.&quot;

During his career, the term &quot;Papinade&quot; was used to describe powerful volleys from difficult angles.

== Managerial career ==

In May 2006, Papin took over from Jacky Duguépéroux as the new coach of Strasbourg, who were relegated to the Second Division. He had previously been coaching Arcachon, an amateur team, and helped them to be promoted from CFA 2 to CFA.

In 2006–07, he guided Strasbourg back to Ligue 1 with a third-placed finish but came under pressure shortly after the end of the season when internal conflicts at the club surfaced in the press. Several players, including &#x27;05 league cup final hero Jean-Christophe Devaux, also openly criticized Papin&#x27;s methods.

Initially confirmed as manager for the 2007–08 season, he was forced to resign a week later after it was revealed that he had interviewed for the vacant managerial job at Lens only hours after his confirmation at Strasbourg. He was replaced by Jean-Marc Furlan, former manager of Troyes, while Lens selected Guy Roux as their new manager. Ironically, Papin eventually became the manager of Lens after the club lost at Strasbourg, as Roux resigned only five games into the 2007–08 season. In the midst of the season, Lens and Papin were fighting to avoid relegation to the Second Division. Lens was also eliminated in the first round of both the UEFA cup and the &quot;Coupe de France&quot; by, respectively, FC Copenhagen (1–1; 1–2) and Second Division side Chamois Niortais (0–1, at home).

On 29 December 2009, Châteauroux hired the coach to replace Dominique Bijotat. He left his position in May 2010 and was replaced by Didier Tholot.

For the 2014–15 season, Papin once again took the managerial position at FC Bassin d&#x27;Archachon in Championnat de France Amateur 2.

On 2 June 2020, Papin was announced as the new manager of Championnat National 2 side C&#x27;Chartres.

He left his position in October 2022 to go back to Marseille as a technical advisor.

== Outside football ==

Papin was also iconic in French pop culture because of his caricature in the satirical TV puppet show &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;Info&quot;. At first, Papin was depicted as a rather dumb football player (a common stereotype in France), his only obsession being the many different ways to score goals. When Papin experienced difficulties in Italy, the coverage became more sympathetic, especially with the infamous &quot;Reviens JPP!&quot; song where even God Himself would urge Papin to come back to his home country, because &quot;France needs you!&quot;.

After his daughter, Emily, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as an infant, Papin started running the Neuf de cœur (Nine of Hearts) foundation, which provides support to families affected by the neurological disorder.

Since 2011, he has participated in the Amélie evenings, organized by Amélie Mauresmo for the benefit of the Institut Curie on the theme play with the artists which happens at each opening of the Open GDF Suez at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin in Paris.

Since 2013, he has been with Youri Djorkaeff, Sylvain Wiltord and Valdo Filho, one of the ambassadors of Footgolf.

<doc id="615841" wikidata="Q180326" url="?curid=615841" title="Lilian Thuram">
<text>Ruddy Lilian Thuram-Ulien (; born 1 January 1972) is a French author, philanthropist and former professional footballer who played as a defender. Widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his era, he was a quick, powerful and versatile player, capable of playing both as a centre-back or as a right-back, and was competent both offensively and defensively.

He began playing football professionally in his homeland with Monaco and played in the top flight in France, Italy and Spain for over 15 seasons, with notable stints in Serie A with both Parma and Juventus before finishing his career with Barcelona. With France, Thuram was a key player for the team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup; his side also won UEFA Euro 2000, and he helped them to runners-up at the 2006 World Cup. Thuram was the most capped player in the history of the France national team with 142 appearances between 1994 and 2008 until Hugo Lloris surpassed the mark in 2022.

Thuram has been described as a &quot;studious&quot; figure off the pitch; in 2010, he became a UNICEF ambassador, and has stood out for his initiatives to fight against racism. 

==Early life==
Thuram was born in Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. His family relocated to mainland France in 1981.

==Club career==
Thuram&#x27;s football career began with Monaco in Ligue 1 in 1991. He then transferred to Parma (1996–2001) and then to Juventus (2001–2006) for £25 million, and eventually to Barcelona in 2006.

===Monaco===
Thuram started his professional career with Monaco in 1991. He only made one appearance that season, but was officially promoted to the first team the following season, when he would go on to make 19 appearances.

He was inserted into the starting XI by the end of 1992 and would go on to make 155 league appearances for the Ligue 1 outfit, before transferring to Parma in the summer of 1996. He made his national team debut in 1994, while at Monaco. With Monaco, he most notably won the Coupe de France in 1991, also reaching the final of the 1991–92 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In total his whole spell at AS Monaco he only scored 11 goals.

However, Thuram scored his only UEFA Champions League goal in his career for Monaco in a 4–1 victory over Spartak Moscow in the 1993–94 season.

===Parma===
In July 1996, Thuram made a high-profile transfer to Italy to join Serie A club Parma. In his first season, he made over 40 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring one goal, as Parma finished second in the 1996–97 Serie A to Juventus. He maintained a starting position in defence throughout his time with Parma, making 163 Serie A appearances and scoring one league goal. In all, he made over 200 appearances for the club, really making a name for himself, also earning caps for France.

Following another impressive season in 2000–01, where Parma reached the Coppa Italia final, and finishing the Serie A season in fourth place, Thuram, along with teammate Gianluigi Buffon, transferred to Juventus. His transfer cost the club 80 billion Italian lire (€41,316,552).

While at Parma, along with eventual Juventus teammates Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro, Thuram won both the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia during the 1998–99 season, immediately followed by the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana.

===Juventus===
In the summer of 2001, Thuram made a transfer to Juventus, along with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Thuram formed defensive partnerships with the likes of Ciro Ferrara, Paolo Montero, Gianluca Pessotto, Mark Iuliano, Alessandro Birindelli, Igor Tudor, Gianluca Zambrotta, Nicola Legrottaglie, Fabio Cannavaro, Giorgio Chiellini, Federico Balzaretti and Jonathan Zebina during his five-year tenure with the club. In his first season with the club, as a right back under Marcello Lippi, Thuram won the 2001–02 Serie A title, also reaching the final of the 2001–02 Coppa Italia. Juventus started the following season by winning the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana, and defended their Serie A title, also reaching the UEFA Champions League final, where they were defeated by rivals Milan on penalties.

Juventus won the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana the following season, reaching another Coppa Italia final, but finished in a disappointing 3rd place in Serie A, and failed to progress past the second round in the Champions League. During the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons under coach Fabio Capello, Thuram, along with Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of defence, with Gianluigi Buffon in goal, Jonathan Zebina at right back and Gianluca Zambrotta at left back formed one of the most expensive, but also most feared, defences in Europe and Italy. During these next two seasons with the club, Thuram won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; two more times with Juventus, although these consecutive league titles were later revoked due to Juventus&#x27; involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal (&quot;calciopoli&quot;). After five years with Juve, Thuram transferred to Barcelona in the Spanish La Liga, in the wake of the &quot;calciopoli&quot; scandal. He managed over 200 total appearances for the club, with two goals.

===Barcelona===

On 24 July 2006, Thuram signed with Barcelona for €5 million after Juventus were relegated to Serie B due to the &quot;calciopoli&quot; scandal.

In Thuram&#x27;s last season (2007–08), he was the third- or fourth-choice centre-back after Carles Puyol, Gabriel Milito and Rafael Márquez.

On 26 June 2008, he was reported as having signed a one-year contract with an option for another year with Paris Saint-Germain. The deal, however, was cancelled shortly after because he was diagnosed with a heart defect that had caused the death of his brother. On 2 August, he announced his final retirement from professional football due to his condition.

==International career==

After becoming world champion in 1998, Thuram was an integral part of France&#x27;s triumph at UEFA Euro 2000, which led to the team being ranked by FIFA as number one from 2001–2002. He also played in the 2002 World Cup, 2006 World Cup, Euro 1996, Euro 2004 and Euro 2008, in addition to winning the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. In France&#x27;s 2–1 group win over England at Euro 2004, Thuram became the third Frenchman to 100 caps, after fellow 1998 champions Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly.

===1998 World Cup===

Thuram was named in the French squad for the 1998 World Cup and played a key part in their entire tournament, most notably in the semi final against Croatia. After getting caught out of position and being at fault for Croatia&#x27;s opening goal, Thuram went on to score a brace, his only international goals, and give France a 2–1 win to take them to the final where the team defeated Brazil 3–0 to win their first World Cup. Thuram was awarded the Bronze Ball as the third most valuable player in the tournament. He, Bixente Lizarazu, Laurent Blanc and Marcel Desailly comprised the backbone of the French defence that conceded only two goals in seven matches.

===2006 World Cup===
After a brief international retirement, France coach Raymond Domenech convinced Thuram to return to the French team on 17 August 2005, along with fellow &quot;Golden Generation&quot; teammates Zinedine Zidane and Claude Makélélé, as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Thuram&#x27;s centre back partnership with William Gallas was to be the foundation for France&#x27;s progression to the final. Thuram earned his 116th cap for France in the group stage match against South Korea in Leipzig on 18 June 2006. In that game he equalled Desailly&#x27;s record number of caps, which he broke in the final group stage match, a 2–0 win over Togo in Cologne on 23 June 2006, winning his 117th cap. He was named the man of the match in France&#x27;s semi-final 1–0 victory against Portugal, coincidentally the same distinction he had earned eight years earlier at the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup.

===Euro 2008===
On 9 June 2008, Thuram took the field against Romania in a group match, and became the first player to make 15 UEFA European Championship finals appearances. The former record of 14 appearances was held by Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo and Karel Poborský. He played one more game during the tournament, raising the number of his appearances to 16, which record was then equaled a few days later by Edwin van der Sar from the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Thuram was the captain of France in the tournament. Along with Claude Makélélé, he announced his retirement from international football on 17 June 2008, after France&#x27;s 2–0 loss to Italy. He finished his career with the national team as France&#x27;s most capped player with 142 appearances. His record was broken by Hugo Lloris in the quarter-finals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

==Style of play==

Thuram was an extremely dominant, consistent, athletic and attentive footballer, who was considered by pundits to be one of the best defenders in the world in his prime. As a defender, he was known for his strength, pace, stamina and his outstanding physical, tactical, and technical attributes, as well as his elegance, intelligence, ability to read the game, his heavy marking of opponents, and his aggressive tackling, which made him difficult to beat in one on one situations; he also excelled in the air. As a full-back, he was known for his ability to make attacking runs up the flank and contribute to his team&#x27;s offensive play after winning back the ball. A large, powerful and versatile player, who was equally competent offensively as he was defensively, he could play on either flank or in the centre, due to his ability with either foot, often alternating between playing as a centre-back or as a right-back, and was even deployed in midfield on occasion. In spite of his physical and tenacious playing style, he was also known to be a fair player.

==Personal life==
He has two sons with his first wife Sandra, Marcus (born 6 August 1997) and Khéphren (born 26 March 2001), and both became international footballers for France in the 2020s. He named his sons after Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey and Egyptian pharaoh Khephren, respectively. Thuram&#x27;s cousin is Amiens player Yohann Thuram-Ulien.

From 2007 to 2013, Thuram was in a relationship with Karine Le Marchand, a French TV host. In August 2022 he married journalist Kareen Guiock, whom he met in 2015; they wed at the Palace of Fontainebleau.

==Media==
Thuram was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

==Political engagement==

Beyond his football career, Thuram has always shown political engagement, and has frequently spoken out against racism. In such, during the French riots in November 2005, Thuram took a position against future French president Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time the head of the conservative political party UMP and Minister of the Interior. Thuram was opposed to the verbal attacks against young people that the then-Minister made when he talked about the &quot;scum&quot;, and he said that Nicolas Sarkozy never lived in a &quot;banlieue&quot;, areas of low-income housing surrounding French cities.

On 6 September 2006, Thuram sparked controversy when he invited 80 people, who were expelled by French Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy from a flat where they lived illegally, to the football match between France and Italy. He has also engaged in campaigns that favour the Catalan language in Northern Catalonia.

In November 2011, Thuram curated an exhibition at the Musée du quai Branly entitled &quot;Human Zoos: The Invention of the Savage&quot;. It examined the human zoos that traced the practice of using colonial subjects as exhibits in zoos and freak shows. The material in the exhibition runs from the parade of Brazil&#x27;s Tupinamba &quot;savages&quot; for the royal entrance of King Henry II of France in 1550 in Rouen, to the last &quot;living spectacle&quot; of Congo villagers exhibited in Brussels in 1958.

In January 2013, Thuram took part in a march through Paris by supporters of the Ayrault government&#x27;s plan to legalise same-sex marriage. He had previously explained that he supported same-sex marriage in the name of equal rights (comparing the denial of equality for homosexuals to the denial of equal rights for women and for black people in earlier periods of history), and in the name of France&#x27;s secular principles (&quot;laïcité&quot;), rejecting religious arguments against civil marriage. He also expressed support for the right of same-sex couples to adopt children. He founded the Fondation Lilian Thuram, which aims to educate people about racism.

<text>David Sergio Trezeguet (, ; born 15 October 1977) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker.

Trezeguet began his career in Argentina with Club Atlético Platense at the age of eight, progressing through their youth system to their first team, where he made his debut in the Primera División in 1994. After one season, he transferred to Division 1 side Monaco, where he would form a striking partnership with international teammate Thierry Henry, winning the league in the 1996–97 season. He left the club in 2000, having scored 52 goals in 93 Division 1 appearances and having claimed two Division 1 championships and the 1997 Trophée des champions.

In 2000, Trezeguet signed for Serie A club Juventus for a transfer fee of £20 million. With 24 goals, he was the joint recipient of the &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; award for top scorer as his team won the 2001–02 Serie A title; Trezeguet also scored eight goals in 10 Champions League appearances as Juventus reached the second round of the tournament. Despite struggling with injuries the following season, he won another league title with the club, and also scored four goals in 10 Champions League appearances as Juventus reached the final of the tournament, eventually losing 2–3 on penalties to Milan, as Trezeguet missed his spot kick in the resulting shoot-out. Overall, Trezeguet scored 138 goals in 245 league appearances for Juventus, making him the fourth-highest goalscorer in the club&#x27;s history. Later in his career he had brief spells in Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina and India.

At international level, Trezeguet scored 34 goals in 71 appearances for the France national team between 1998 and 2008. He also played for France at under-18, under-20, and under-21 levels. Trezeguet represented France at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 (scoring the golden goal in the final against Italy, which gave France a 2–1 win in extra time), the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup (where he missed his penalty in the shoot-out against Italy in the final). Trezeguet is part of the FIFA 100 list of &quot;125 Greatest living players&quot;. In 2015, he was named one of the Golden Foot Award Legends.

==Personal life==
Trezeguet was born in Rouen, Normandy, France, but grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His father, Jorge Trezeguet, is a former Argentine footballer who worked as his agent, and his mother, Beatriz, is Argentine. David Trezeguet has a younger sister.

Trezeguet was married to Beatriz Villalba for 13 years, they have two sons together, Aarón (born 2000) and Noraan (born 2008). Beatriz is from Alicante, Spain. They divorced in 2012. Aaron did not follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a footballer, instead practicing Muay Thai kickboxing.

==Club career==
===Platense===
Trezeguet began his career at Platense in the Argentine Primera División, where he played his first professional game on 12 June 1994 as a 16-year-old in a 1–1 tie against Gimnasia. After just five matches with the team, he moved to his native country to play for AS Monaco.

===Monaco===
In 1995, he was close to joining Paris Saint-Germain, but the deal was cancelled after the two clubs failed to agree a deal. Shortly afterwards, he opted to join Monaco. Monaco coach Jean Tigana was &quot;impressed&quot; by Trezeguet, who scored five goals in trial, signing a deal which saw him earn 15,000 francs a month.

Trezeguet spent two seasons with Monaco B, having made just nine appearances in total for the club&#x27;s first team during his first two seasons. In 1998, Trezeguet scored the fastest ever goal in terms of velocity in UEFA Champions League history in a quarter-final match against Manchester United. The shot that resulted in a goal was clocked at 97.6 mph (157.3 km/h). With Monaco, he won Ligue 1 twice and was named Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year in 1998. He scored a total of 60 goals in 113 appearances for the French club and it was here that he made his name as a potent goalscoring poacher.

===Juventus===
During his first season with Juventus, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, Trezeguet managed 14 goals in Serie A, despite being predominantly utilised as a substitute striker, behind Filippo Inzaghi, who started alongside Alessandro Del Piero. Juventus missed out on the 2000–01 Serie A title that season, finishing in second place behind Roma. In his second season at the club, under manager Marcello Lippi, he scored 24 league goals in 34 league matches to finish as the Serie A top goalscorer, along with Dario Hübner of Piacenza, as Juventus won the 2001–02 Serie A title. That same season, he was named Serie A Footballer of the Year and Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year, also reaching the final of the 2001–02 Coppa Italia; he also scored eight goals in ten UEFA Champions League appearances, although the club were eliminated in the second round of the competition. In January 2002, a car carrying Trezeguet and teammates Mark Iuliano, Gianluca Zambrotta and Enzo Maresca after a 3–1 win over Hellas Verona, collided with two others; none of the four players were injured in the accident. In his third season, his appearances were limited by injuries, although he still helped Juventus to defend the Serie A title, also winning the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana and scoring four goals in ten appearances as Juventus reached the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. In the final, Trezeguet was one of three Juventus players to have their penalty saved by Milan keeper Dida, as Juventus lost 3–2 on penalty kicks after a 0–0 draw. This would be the closest Trezeguet ever got to winning the Champions League. During the 2003–04 season, Trezeguet helped the team to win a second consecutive Supercoppa Italiana title, scoring a goal during the match, also reaching another Coppa Italia final, although their European and domestic league campaigns would be less successful, despite his 16 goals in Serie A that season, as the club finished the league in third place. In 2004, Brazilian legend Pelé included Trezeguet in the FIFA 100, his list of the 125 greatest living footballers.

Although Trezeguet won the 2004–05 Serie A and 2005–06 Serie A titles with Juventus, scoring 23 league goals in the 2005–06 season, Juventus were caught in the 2006 Italian football scandal that rocked Italian football, and along with Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina were accused of match fixing. While the players had no part in the scandal, Juventus were subsequently stripped of their 2004–05 and 2005–06 titles, relegated to Serie B, and were to start the 2006–07 season with a deficit of 30 points, eventually reduced to nine points on appeal. Following the enforced relegation to Serie B, the club lost several of its star players, including Fabio Cannavaro to Real Madrid, Gianluca Zambrotta to Barcelona, Adrian Mutu to Fiorentina, and Zlatan Ibrahimović to Internazionale. Trezeguet&#x27;s compatriots Lilian Thuram and Patrick Vieira also left Juventus, for Barcelona and Inter, respectively. Manager Fabio Capello defected to Real Madrid and former Juventus legend and Trezeguet&#x27;s former France teammate and captain, Didier Deschamps, was appointed the new manager of Juve. As one of the club&#x27;s star players, Trezeguet was heavily linked to a move away from Juventus, but he ultimately stayed with the &quot;Bianconeri&quot; to help the club return to Italy&#x27;s top flight.

On 16 September 2006, before Juventus&#x27; Serie B match against Vicenza, he was awarded a commemorative plate in recognition of his 125 career goals. On 19 May 2007, Juventus achieved promotion to Serie A after a 5–1 win over Arezzo. Trezeguet scored the fifth goal which made the promotion mathematically possible. Despite the successful return to Serie A, and an eventual Serie B title, the season was not without controversy. After scoring a goal in Juventus&#x27; final match of the 2006–07 Serie B season against Spezia, Trezeguet made a gesture toward the club president, making a number 15 with his fingers – the number of goals he scored throughout the Serie B season – which was followed by a hand gesture which, in Italian, means &quot;I&#x27;m out of here&quot;. Juventus, however, announced on 25 June 2007 that Trezeguet had renewed his contract until 2011.

During the 2007–08 Serie A season, Trezeguet scored 20 league goals and was second only to teammate and club captain Alessandro Del Piero for the &quot;Capocannoniere&quot;. Juventus finished third in the league to qualify for the Champions League after missing out on the tournament for two consecutive seasons.

In the 2008–09 season, Trezeguet sustained a groin injury that kept him out for most of the season. Trezeguet finally made his return on 4 February 2009 against Napoli in the Coppa Italia and had a goal controversially disallowed. Nevertheless, he was one of the players who scored in the penalty shootout, which Juventus won 4–3. Trezeguet would shortly get his first goal of 2009 in a 2–0 win against Palermo in late February – a match where he received the captaincy for the first time in his professional career. Juventus finished the season in second place in the league, also reaching the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League.

On 9 December 2009, Trezeguet scored his 168th goal for Juventus in a 4–1 defeat to Bayern Munich in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, making him the club&#x27;s highest-ever foreign goalscorer, surpassing Omar Sívori&#x27;s total of 167 goals. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Trezeguet ranked fourth among Juventus&#x27; all-time top goalscorers with 171 goals. In August 2010, he was released from the remaining 12 months of his contract by Juventus.

===Hércules===
On 28 August 2010, Trezeguet completed his move to newly promoted La Liga team Hércules on a two-year deal; the club is based in his then wife&#x27;s hometown. He made his debut on 11 September in a 2–0 surprise victory against defending champions Barcelona. Eight days later, Trezeguet scored his first goal for the club, a conversion from the penalty spot in a 2–1 loss against Valencia. He was unable to prevent relegation for the side, however, and left the club at the start of the summer of 2011. Trezeguet made 31 league appearances and scored 12 goals, making him the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for the season.

===Baniyas===
On 30 August 2011, Trezeguet completed his move to UAE Pro-League side Baniyas on a one-year deal. On 21 November 2011, his contract was mutually terminated due to an injury which had kept him sidelined for most of the season. Trezeguet only appeared in the opening league match and a fixture in the Etisalat Emirates Cup for Baniyas.

===River Plate===
On 19 December 2011, Trezeguet moved to River Plate in Argentina on a three-year contract, shortly after the club was relegated to the Argentine second division for the first time in its history. Trezeguet, a childhood fan of River, having grown up in Buenos Aires, spoke of it as his dream move, saying, &quot;Being here is a unique feeling, motivated by everything that River represents.&quot; On 19 January 2012, Trezeguet scored in his first appearance for River Plate in a friendly match against Racing Club.

He made his official debut on 13 February 2012. He played his first match at Estadio Monumental the following week and scored his first official goal for River Plate after coming on as a substitute. On 26 February, he scored his second official goal, again after coming on as a substitute in the second half. Trezeguet scored his first double in River Plate on 10 March against Defensa y Justicia, the first goal giving River Plate a 2–1 lead, while the second one tying the match 3–3. In the next match, he played for the first time in the starting XI and scored in the first half to maintain his excellent scoring form for River Plate.

Trezeguet would later state that the adrenaline he gets while playing for River surpasses any other moment he experienced in his career, including winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup with France and scoring the golden goal in the finals of UEFA Euro 2000: &quot;I am feeling things that I have never felt before. Not with Juventus, nor with Monaco and not even at international level with France. Being a River fan and seeing the passion that exists in this team, all the people and all the pressure, I have more adrenaline than ever before.&quot;

In the final match of the championship against Almirante Brown on 23 June, Trezeguet secured victory by scoring both of River&#x27;s goals to seal promotion back to the top flight; Trezeguet also missed a penalty during the match. Trezeguet finished his first season at River Plate with 13 goals in 18 matches, finishing sixth behind the team&#x27;s top goalscorer, Fernando Cavenaghi.

On 9 September 2012, he scored his first goal in the Primera División Argentina against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in a 3–3 draw. He would later score against Estudiantes de La Plata in a 1–0 win and also against Colón in a 2–1 victory.

Despite being a key member of the River Plate squad which returned to the Primera División Argentina, it was decided in June by head coach and manager Ramón Díaz that he would no longer be a part of the team&#x27;s squad, despite fan protests.

=== Newell&#x27;s Old Boys ===
On 22 July 2013, Trezeguet joined Newell&#x27;s Old Boys on a one-year deal. He made his debut on 18 August coming on as a substitute for Víctor Aquino in the 73rd minute, his side drew 0–0 with Belgrano. In his second game for the NOB he scored his first goal in the 90th minute against Atletico Rafaela, they won the game 2–0. On 1 November, Trezeguet scored his 300th career goal against Colón and 11 minutes later followed up with his 301st career goal and subsequently the equaliser, drawing 2–2 on the night.

On 16 March 2014, Trezeguet was subbed on in the 78th minute for Ezequiel Ponce. In the 83rd minute he scored the second goal of the game with his side winning 2–0 against Racing Club, a team which Trezeguet&#x27;s former Juventus teammate Mauro Camoranesi played for and was subbed on earlier in the match.

=== Pune City ===
On 30 July 2014, Trezeguet signed for Indian Super League club Pune City. Trezeguet scored his first goal for the club against Goa, by the virtue of which, his franchise registered their first victory in the tournament. This was followed by his second and his last goal in ISL, which came in a defeat against Kerala Blasters.

On 20 January 2015, it was announced that Trezeguet had retired as a player and was set to join the Juventus management team. It was confirmed by Trezeguet&#x27;s agent.

==International career==
As a French–Argentinian, Trezeguet was eligible to play for France or Argentina.

Trezeguet first competed internationally in the French youth squad alongside Thierry Henry, Willy Sagnol, and William Gallas, and played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. In the lead up to the 1998 World Cup in France, Aimé Jacquet gave younger players such as David Trezeguet, Henry and Patrick Vieira the chance to display their talent, and all three were eventually selected for the World Cup ahead of experienced French players including David Ginola. Trezeguet scored one goal in the tournament, in the 4–0 win over Saudi Arabia, as France went on to win the World Cup, defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final at the Stade de France. Two years later France were crowned European champions after defeating Italy 2–1 in the Euro 2000 final, courtesy of Trezeguet&#x27;s golden goal in extra time from a Robert Pires assist.

Although ranked first in the world, France was not very successful in the 2002 World Cup, being eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal, despite David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry and Djibril Cissé being the top goalscorers respectively in Serie A, the Premier League and Ligue 1 that season. The failure was then followed up by a quarter-final exit at Euro 2004 at the hands of unheralded Greece with Trezeguet scoring just one goal in the tournament in a 2–2 draw against Croatia. However, with the return of Zinedine Zidane from brief international retirement, France would go on to reach the final of the 2006 World Cup. Throughout the tournament, Trezeguet found himself out of place in Raymond Domenech&#x27;s 4–2–3–1 formation which only used one striker – a position allocated to Thierry Henry. On 9 July 2006, Trezeguet took part in the final, coming on as a substitute. The match, against Italy, went to a penalty shootout and Trezeguet was the only player from either team to miss his penalty, his shot hitting the crossbar, as Italy won 5–3 on penalty kicks after a 1–1 draw.

On 19 October 2007, Trezeguet threatened to quit France after being overlooked for two Euro 2008 qualifying matches by coach Raymond Domenech. On 26 March 2008, Trezeguet was selected for a friendly against England to replace the injured Karim Benzema, which would turn out to be his last appearance for France as he was subsequently not chosen for the squad that competed in Euro 2008.

On 9 July 2008, he announced his retirement from international football, finishing his France career ranked third among France&#x27;s all-time top goalscorers with 34 goals from 71 caps. He cited &quot;the awful Euro 2008 and the reappointment of the coach&quot; being the main reasons for this decision, and also added &quot;I see football differently from how they see it in France. Euro 2008 was very negative, but what annoys me more is that Domenech is staying.&quot;

==Style of play==
Trezeguet was a prolific, complete, and talented striker, who was gifted with pace, power, instinct, and an eye for goal. A highly opportunistic player, he was excellent at taking advantage of chances and loose balls in the area, and was an accurate striker of the ball, known for his clinical finishing, as well as his ability to score with few touches, due to his ability to shoot first time and finish off chances from close range, even when off-balance or from awkward positions. He was capable of scoring with either foot, despite being naturally right footed, as well as with his head, and excelled in the air; he was also known for having a penchant for scoring acrobatic goals. Although he wasn&#x27;t particularly talented, skillful, or known for his link-up play, he was also highly regarded for his positional sense, anticipation, reactions, offensive movement, and his ability to lose his markers, as well as for his skill at playing with his back to goal, courtesy of his solid technique. Considered to be one of the best strikers of his generation, due to the number of goals he scored for Juventus he gained the nicknames: &quot;Cobra&quot;, &quot;Trezegol&quot;, and &quot;Re David&quot; (King David, in Italian), during his time at the club. Despite his ability, his playing time throughout his career was often limited by injuries.

<text>Alchemical symbols were used to denote chemical elements and compounds, as well as alchemical apparatus and processes, until the 18th century. Although notation was partly standardized, style and symbol varied between alchemists. Lüdy-Tenger published an inventory of 3,695 symbols and variants, and that was not exhaustive, omitting for example many of the symbols used by Isaac Newton. This page therefore lists only the most common symbols.

==Three primes==
According to Paracelsus (1493–1541), the three primes or &quot;tria prima&quot; – of which material substances are immediately composed – are:
* Sulfur or soul, the principle of combustibility: 🜍 ()
* Mercury or spirit, the principle of fusibility and volatility: ☿ ()
* Salt or body, the principle of non-combustibility and non-volatility: 🜔 ()

==Four basic elements==

Western alchemy makes use of the four classical elements. The symbols used for these are:
* Air 🜁 ()
* Earth 🜃 ()
* Fire 🜂 ()
* Water 🜄 ()

==Seven ==
The seven metals known since Classical times in Europe were associated with the seven classical planets; this figured heavily in alchemical symbolism. The exact correlation varied over time, and in early centuries bronze or electrum were sometimes found instead of mercury, or copper for Mars instead of iron; however, gold, silver, and lead had always been associated with the Sun, Moon, and Saturn.
The associations below are attested from the 7th century and had stabilized by the 15th. They started breaking down with the discovery of antimony, bismuth, and zinc in the 16th century. Alchemists would typically call the metals by their planetary names, e.g. &quot;Saturn&quot; for lead, &quot;Mars&quot; for iron; compounds of tin, iron, and silver continued to be called &quot;jovial&quot;, &quot;martial&quot;, and &quot;lunar&quot;; or &quot;of Jupiter&quot;, &quot;of Mars&quot;, and &quot;of the moon&quot;, through the 17th century. The tradition remains today with the name of the element mercury, where chemists decided the planetary name was preferable to common names like &quot;quicksilver&quot;, and in a few archaic terms such as (silver nitrate) and saturnism (lead poisoning).
* Lead, corresponding with Saturn ♄ ()
* Tin, corresponding with Jupiter ♃ ()
* Iron, corresponding with Mars ♂ ()
* Gold, corresponding with the Sun ☉ 🜚 ☼ ( )
* Copper, corresponding with Venus ♀ ()
* Quicksilver, corresponding with Mercury ☿ ()
* Silver, corresponding with the Moon ☽ or ☾ ( or ) [also 🜛 in Newton]

==Mundane elements and later metals==

* Antimony ♁ () (in Newton), also 
* Arsenic 🜺 ()
* Bismuth ♆ () (in Newton), 🜘 () (in Bergman)
* Cobalt (approximately 🜶) (in Bergman)
* Manganese (in Bergman)
* Nickel (in Bergman; previously used for of sulfur)
* Oxygen (in Lavoisier)
* Phlogiston (in Bergman)
* Phosphorus or 
* Platinum or (in Bergman et al.)
* Sulfur 🜍 () (in Newton)
* Zinc (in Bergman)

==Alchemical compounds==

The following symbols, among others, have been adopted into Unicode.
* Acid (incl. vinegar) 🜊 ()
* Sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) 🜹 ()
* Aqua fortis (nitric acid) 🜅 (), A.F.
* Aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid) 🜆 (), 🜇 (), A.R.
* Spirit of wine (concentrated ethanol; called &quot;aqua vitae&quot; or &quot;spiritus vini&quot;) 🜈 (), S.V. or 🜉 ()
* Amalgam (alloys of a metal and mercury) 🝛 () = a͞a͞a, ȧȧȧ (among other abbreviations).
* Cinnabar (mercury sulfide) 🜓 ()
* Vinegar (distilled) 🜋 () (in Newton)
* Vitriol (sulfates) 🜖 ()
* Black sulphur (residue from sublimation of sulfur) 🜏 ()

==Alchemical processes==

The alchemical magnum opus was sometimes expressed as a series of chemical operations. In cases where these numbered twelve, each could be assigned one of the Zodiac signs as a form of cryptography. The following example can be found in Pernety&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire mytho-hermétique&quot; (1758):

# Calcination (Aries ) ♈︎
# Congelation (Taurus ) ♉︎
# Fixation (Gemini ) ♊︎
# Solution (Cancer ) ♋︎
# Digestion (Leo ) ♌︎
# Distillation (Virgo ) ♍︎
# Sublimation (Libra ) ♎︎
# Separation (Scorpio ) ♏︎
# Ceration (Sagittarius ) ♐︎
# Fermentation (Capricorn ) ♑︎ (Putrefaction)
# Multiplication (Aquarius ) ♒︎
# Projection (Pisces ) ♓︎

==Units==
Several symbols indicate units of time.
* Month 🝱 () or or xXx
* Day-Night 🝰 ()
* Hour 🝮 ()

==Unicode==

The Alchemical Symbols block was added to Unicode in 2010 as part of Unicode 6.0.
==Gallery==
A list of symbols published in 1931:

An 1888 reproduction of a Venetian list of medieval Greek alchemical symbols from about the year 1100 but circulating since about 300 and attributed to Zosimos of Panopolis. The list starts with 🜚 for gold and has early conventions that would later change: here ☿ is tin and ♃ electrum; ☾ is silver but ☽ is mercury. Many of the &#x27;symbols&#x27; are simply abbreviations of the Greek word or phrase. View the files on Commons for the list of symbols.

<doc id="615847" wikidata="Q751350" url="?curid=615847" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1959">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine which ranks the best-performing singles in the United States. In 1959, it was compiled based on a combination of sales and airplay data sourced from surveys of retail outlets and playlists submitted by radio stations respectively, and 16 different singles spent time at number one.

In the issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; dated January 5, the Chipmunks with David Seville were at number one with &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot;, the single&#x27;s third week in the top spot. The single remained at number one for a further week before being displaced by &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; by the Platters in the issue dated January 19. Not until 2019 would another Christmas song top the Hot 100, albeit for much of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s holiday-themed songs were excluded from the chart.

Every act to top the Hot 100 in 1959 did so for the first time since the chart was launched in August 1958. The Platters, Paul Anka, Elvis Presley, and Guy Mitchell had all achieved number ones on the separate sales, airplay, and jukebox play charts which &quot;Billboard&quot; had published prior to the creation of the consolidated Hot 100, as had Seville without the Chipmunks. The Fleetwoods and Frankie Avalon were the only acts to have two number ones in 1959, but neither act would top the Hot 100 again. Bobby Darin spent nine non-consecutive weeks at number one with &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, making it the year&#x27;s longest-running number one and Darin the act with the most weeks in the top spot. At the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in November 1959, the song won the award for Record of the Year, but it would prove to be Darin&#x27;s only number one on the Hot 100. In the first of its two spells atop the chart, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; spent six weeks at number one, tying with &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; by Johnny Horton for the year&#x27;s longest unbroken run in the peak position.

<text>Karl-Heinz &quot;Kalle&quot; Rummenigge (; born 25 September 1955) is a German football executive and former professional player. Considered as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest German footballers ever, he was also the longtime Chairman of Executive Board of FC Bayern München AG, a daughter company of German Bundesliga team Bayern Munich.

As a player, Rummenigge had his greatest career success with Bayern Munich, where he won the Intercontinental Cup, two European Cups, as well as two league titles and two domestic cups. He also won two Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, in 1980 and 1981. In 2004, Rummenigge was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

A member of the West Germany national team, Rummenigge won the 1980 European Championship and was part of the squad that finished runner-up in the 1982 FIFA World Cup and at the 1986 World Cup.

Rummenigge is a former chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), serving in that capacity from 2008 until 2017. He also served as representative of the ECA to the UEFA Executive Committee from 2021 to 2024.

==Club career==

Rummenigge was born in Lippstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia.

He joined Bayern Munich in 1974, coming from the Westphalian amateur side Borussia Lippstadt, for a transfer fee of ca. €10,000. He immediately showed great strength as a dribbler. His scoring qualities were initially insignificant, but would find great improvement in later years, particularly after the arrival of coach Pal Csernai in 1979. In 1979–80, he scored 26 goals and became for the first time the Bundesliga&#x27;s top striker, a feat he repeated in 1981 and 1984 with 29 and 26 goals, respectively.

With Bayern he won the European Cup in 1975 and 1976. In 1975, he did not take part in the final of the competition, whilst in the year thereafter a glass of brandy sufficiently prepared the nervous Rummenigge to contribute to the defeat of AS Saint-Étienne. In the same year he became also part of the team that prevailed in the Intercontinental Cup finals against Cruzeiro EC from Belo Horizonte.

In the era of coach Csernai he found in midfielder Paul Breitner a congenial partner and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were only called Breitnigge (name invented by German newspaper Bild).

The club, then often dubbed as &quot;FC Breitnigge&quot;, won in this period the Bundesliga title in 1980 and 1981, and the DFB-Pokal in 1982 and 1984. A renewed triumph in the European Cup was denied, when the club lost the 1982 final narrowly against Aston Villa. In the season before Rummenigge was top-scorer in this competition with 6 goals.

His substantial contribution to the successes of the club and the Germany national football team found also expression in personal honours. In 1980, he was named German Footballer of the Year and in 1980–1981 the European Footballer of the Year.

In 1984, aged 29, he was sold for a record fee of €5.7m to Inter Milan. Despite a notable beginning, in which he helped the team to compete until the end for the 1984–85 &quot;Scudetto&quot;, Rumenigge&#x27;s career in Italy was mostly marred by injury problems. At the end of his contract in 1987, Rummenigge moved on to Swiss first division club Servette FC in Geneva, where he saw his career out. In his last season, 1988–89, he had his last success, becoming top scorer in the Swiss league with 24 goals.

==International career==
With the West Germany national team he took part in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, 1982 World Cup in Spain and the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. In 1978, West Germany exited in the second group stage of the tournament. In 1982 and 1986, the team was runner-up behind Italy and Argentina, giving him the unique distinction of captaining the senior team to two silver medals in the FIFA World Cup.

Rummenigge also took part in two European Championship tournaments. In the 1980 competition in Italy, West Germany defeated Belgium in the final by 2–1 to win their second UEFA Euro.

Altogether, between 1976 and 1986, Rummenigge amassed 95 caps and scored 45 goals for West Germany, including one in extra-time in the 1982 World Cup semi-final victory over France, and one in the losing 1986 World Cup final match against Argentina. He also scored a hat-trick in a group stage game against Chile during the 1982 World Cup.

==Style of play==
One of the most talented attacking players of his generation, Rummenigge was often lauded as a highly versatile forward, capable of playing as a second striker, winger, or flat-out centre forward. His main strengths were his pace, dribbling, heading and goalscoring ability, from both close range and from outside the box. He also had a penchant for scoring from awkward situations.

Rummenigge was also praised for his both-footedness, leadership and physical strength. However, his later career was greatly affected by injuries, in particular after his move to Inter Milan.

==Bayern Munich management==

In autumn 1991, Bayern Munich invited Franz Beckenbauer and Rummenigge to return to the club as vice presidents. Rummenigge held this position until February 2002, when he was appointed Chairman of Executive Board of the newly corporatised football department of the club (FC Bayern München AG). According to the club, &quot;in his role as chairman he is responsible for external relations, new media, board affairs and representing the holding company on national and international bodies.&quot;

During his tenure, Bayern Munich managed to move to their new stadium, Allianz Arena. Oliver Kahn took over his CEO position at Bayern Munich from 1 July 2021. Rummenigge was appointed a member of the supervisory board on 30 May 2023.

==Miscellaneous==
In April 1983, the British pop duo Alan &amp; Denise recorded a tribute song about his &quot;sexy knees&quot; in the song &quot;Rummenigge&quot;. The single reached number 43 in German charts.

From 1990 until 1994, Rummenigge worked as a TV co–commentator for matches of the Germany national team.

In March 2004, he was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers.

His brother Michael Rummenigge was also a noteworthy footballer. He played as forward for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund from 1982 to 1988 and 1988 to 1994, respectively. He also represented Germany on two occasions between 1983 and 1986.

Rummenigge and his wife Martina have three sons and two daughters born between 1980 and 1991.

Rummenigge supports ending the 50+1 rule.

<doc id="615851" wikidata="Q487140" url="?curid=615851" title="Frenulum breve">
<text>Frenulum breve, or short frenulum, is a condition in which the frenulum of the penis, which is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the foreskin and helps contract it over the glans, is too short and thus restricts the movement of the foreskin. The frenulum should normally be sufficiently long and supple to allow for the full retraction of the foreskin so that it lies smoothly back on the shaft of the erect penis.

The penile frenulum is comparable to the tongue&#x27;s frenulum between the tongue&#x27;s lower surface and the lower jaw, or the frenulum between the upper lip and the outside of the upper gum.

A frenulum breve leads to ventral deviation of the glans and pain during erection. Sometimes, tearing of the frenulum causes heavy bleeding. The tearing of frenulum breve occurs particularly during sexual activity of young men.

Frenulum breve may be complicated by tearing of the frenulum during sexual or other activity and is a cause of dyspareunia. The torn frenulum may result in healing with scar tissue that is less flexible after the incident causing further difficulties. However, this tearing can also solve the problem, healing such that the frenulum is longer and therefore no longer problematic.

A short frenulum can present in various grades of severity, and its diagnosis may depend on the subjective criteria of evaluation at physical examination in a medical office as there is no standard definition. Frenulum restricts the movement of the prepuce, even when not causing obvious phimosis. When the foreskin is completely retracted over the glans, a short frenulum tugs down the glans. One study arbitrarily defined a &quot;short frenulum&quot; as that which causes a ventral curvature of the glans major of 20° or more upon gentle retraction of the foreskin in the clinic. Short frenulum in this study was a common cause of premature ejaculation, and frenuloplasty significantly improved the ejaculation latency. Short frenulum may be more sensitive in subjects with premature ejaculation. Also, due to the limitation of the length of frenulum, and for the fear of pain, the strokes during Sexual intercourse may be shorter, but faster, thus leading to early ejaculation.

Severe frenulum breve when associated with significant difficulty during sexual intercourse may lead to erroneous labelling of the sufferer as having psychosexual problems.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of severe frenulum breve is almost always confused with that of phimosis and a generally tight foreskin, since the symptom is difficulty retracting the foreskin. Most men with phimosis also have frenulum breve to a certain extent. A milder frenulum breve may go unrecognized, since foreskin may retract over the glans variably.

==Treatment==
The condition may be treated with stretching exercises and steroid creams. It also may be treated with surgery. There are several different techniques to treat this condition. Threading a suture through the lower membrane, and then tying a tight knot around the frenulum itself is a procedure that minimises invasive action. After a few days the frenulum will weaken and eventually break apart to allow the prepuce to fully retract. Other procedures involve the cutting of the skin and require the use of sutures to help in the healing process. Alternatively, it may be treated by a reparative plastic surgery operation called a frenuloplasty, or by complete circumcision including resection of the frenulum (frenectomy). An alternative method that does not require stitches (sutures) is the &quot;pull and burn&quot; method, where high-frequency electrical current is used to destroy the short and tight frenulum. This method may circumvent common complications such as frenular artery ligation and subsequent stenosis of the urethral meatus or creation of skin tags and suture remnants that create a poor cosmetic result.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;frenulum&quot; is a diminutive of the Latin word , which means &quot;bridle&quot;. is Latin neutral for &quot;short&quot;.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number one hits of 1962.

That year, 14 acts achieved their first number one songs, namely Joey Dee and the Starliters, Gene Chandler, Bruce Channel, Shelley Fabares, Mr. Acker Bilk, David Rose, Bobby Vinton, Neil Sedaka, Little Eva, Tommy Roe, The Four Seasons, Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett, The Crystals, and The Tornados. The Four Seasons were the only act to have more than one song hit number one that year.

NOTE: &quot;Billboard&quot; changed its issue dates from a Monday back to a Saturday schedule on January 6, thus fixing the previous one-week inconsistency. The issue dates were originally changed from a Saturday to a Monday schedule on April 29, 1957.
