<text>The periodic table is an arrangement of the chemical elements, structured by their atomic number, electron configuration and recurring chemical properties. In the basic form, elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number, in the reading sequence. Then, rows and columns are created by starting new rows and inserting blank cells, so that rows (periods) and columns (groups) show elements with recurring properties (called periodicity). For example, all elements in group (column) 18 are noble gases that are largely—though not completely—unreactive.

The history of the periodic table reflects over two centuries of growth in the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the elements, with major contributions made by Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, John Newlands, Julius Lothar Meyer, Dmitri Mendeleev, Glenn T. Seaborg, and others.

== Early history ==
Around 330 BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more &quot;roots&quot;, an idea originally suggested by the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles. The four roots, which the Athenian philosopher Plato called &quot;elements&quot;, were &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;air&quot; and &quot;fire&quot;. Similar ideas existed in other ancient traditions, such as Indian philosophy with five elements: Earth, water, fire, air and aether collectively called &#x27;pañca bhūta&#x27;. 

Of the chemical elements shown on the periodic table, nine – carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, silver, tin, gold, mercury, and lead – have been known since antiquity, as they are found in their native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools. Five more elements were known in the age of alchemy: zinc, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Platinum was known to pre-Columbian South Americans, but knowledge of it did not reach Europe until the 16th century.

== First classification ==
The history of the periodic table is also a history of the discovery of the chemical elements. 
In 1661, Boyle defined elements as &quot;those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.&quot;

The first person in recorded history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant. Brand tried to discover the philosopher&#x27;s stone—a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base metals into gold. In 1669, or later, his experiments with distilled human urine resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called &quot;cold fire&quot; (&quot;kaltes Feuer&quot;). He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance (any given variety of matter) to be an element, in a world where versions of atomic theory were only and later understandings of the nature of substances were only beginning to become possible.

In 1718, Étienne François Geoffroy&#x27;s Affinity Table made use of several aspects — (1) tabular grouping and (2) correlation with chemical affinity — that would later be reprised. 

In 1789, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier wrote &quot;Traité Élémentaire de Chimie&quot; (&quot;Elementary Treatise of Chemistry&quot;), which is considered to be the first modern textbook about chemistry. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance whose smallest units cannot be broken down into a simpler substance. Lavoisier&#x27;s book contained a list of &quot;simple substances&quot; that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, mercury, zinc and sulfur, which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier&#x27;s list also included &quot;light&quot; and &quot;caloric&quot;, which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading chemists refused to believe Lavoisier&#x27;s new revelations, the &quot;Elementary Treatise&quot; was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier&#x27;s descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.

In 1808–10, British natural philosopher John Dalton published a method by which to arrive at provisional atomic weights for the elements known in his day, from stoichiometric measurements and reasonable inferences. Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory was adopted by many chemists during the 1810s and 1820s.

In 1815, British physician and chemist William Prout noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.

In 1817, German physicist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements. In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties. He termed these groups &quot;triads&quot;.

Definition of Triad law

&quot;Chemically analogous elements arranged in increasing order of their atomic weights formed well marked groups of three called Triads in which the atomic weight of the middle element was found to be generally the arithmetic mean of the atomic weight of the other two elements in the triad.

#chlorine, bromine, and iodine
#calcium, strontium, and barium
#sulfur, selenium, and tellurium
#lithium, sodium, and potassium&quot;

All those attempts to sort elements by atomic weights were inhibited by the inaccurate determination of weights, and not just slightly: carbon, oxygen and many other elements were believed to be half their actual masses (cf. the illustration by Dalton above), because only monatomic gases were believed to exist. Even though Amedeo Avogadro and, independently of him, André-Marie Ampère, proposed the solution in the form of diatomic molecules and Avogadro&#x27;s law already in the 1810s, it was not until after Stanislao Cannizzaro&#x27;s publications in late 1850s when the theory began to be widely considered.

In 1860, the modern scientific consensus emerged at the first international chemical conference, the Karlsruhe Congress, and a revised list of elements and atomic masses was adopted. It helped spur creation of more extensive systems. The first such system emerged in two years.

== Comprehensive formalizations ==

French geologist Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois noticed that the elements, when ordered by their atomic weights, displayed similar properties at regular intervals. In 1862, he devised a three-dimensional chart, named the &quot;telluric helix&quot;, after the element tellurium, which fell near the center of his diagram. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically. The original paper from Chancourtois in &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot; did not include a chart and used geological rather than chemical terms. In 1863, he extended his work by including a chart and adding ions and compounds.

The next attempt was made in 1864. British chemist John Newlands presented in &quot;Chemical News&quot; a classification of the 62 known elements. Newlands noticed recurring trends in physical properties of the elements at recurring intervals of multiples of eight in order of mass number; based on this observation, he produced a classification of these elements into eight groups. Each group displayed a similar progression; Newlands likened these progressions to the progression of notes within a musical scale. Newlands&#x27;s table left no gaps for possible future elements, and in some cases had two elements at the same position in the same octave. Newlands&#x27;s table was ignored or ridiculed by some of his contemporaries. The Chemical Society refused to publish his work. The president of the Society, William Odling, defended the Society&#x27;s decision by saying that such &quot;theoretical&quot; topics might be controversial; there was even harsher opposition from within the Society, suggesting the elements could have been just as well listed alphabetically. Later that year, Odling suggested a table of his own but failed to get recognition following his role in opposing Newlands&#x27;s table.

German chemist Lothar Meyer also noted the sequences of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals. According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (i.e. vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissas (i.e. horizontally)—the curve obtained is a series of maximums and minimums—the most electropositive elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights. In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their valence—for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights. In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev&#x27;s first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.

In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged 63 elements by increasing atomic weight in several columns, noting recurring chemical properties across them. It is sometimes said that he played &quot;chemical solitaire&quot; on long train journeys, using cards containing the symbols, atomic weights, and chemical properties of the known elements. Another possibility is that he was inspired in part by the periodicity of the Sanskrit alphabet, which was pointed out to him by his friend and linguist Otto von Böhtlingk. Mendeleev used the trends he saw to suggest that atomic weights of some elements were incorrect, and accordingly changed their placements: for instance, he figured there was no place for a trivalent beryllium with the atomic weight of 14 in his work, and he cut both the atomic weight and valency of beryllium by a third, suggesting it was a divalent element with the atomic weight of 9.4. Mendeleev widely distributed printed broadsheets of the table to various chemists in Russia and abroad. Mendeleev argued in 1869 there were seven types of highest oxides. Mendeleev continued to improve his ordering; in 1870, it gained a tabular shape, and each column was given its own highest oxide, and in 1871, he further developed it and formulated what he termed the &quot;law of periodicity&quot;. Some changes also occurred with new revisions, with some elements changing positions.

==Priority dispute and recognition==
=== Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions and inability to incorporate the rare-earth metals ===


Even as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and that the properties of such undiscovered elements could be deduced from their expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed predictions for three elements, which he termed &quot;eka-boron&quot;, &quot;eka-aluminium&quot;, and &quot;eka-silicium&quot;; he also more briefly noted a few other expectations. It has been proposed that the prefixes &quot;eka&quot;, &quot;dvi&quot;, and &quot;tri&quot;, Sanskrit for one, two, and three, respectively, are a tribute to Pāṇini and other ancient Sanskrit grammarians for their invention of a periodic alphabet. In 1871, Mendeleev expanded his predictions further.

Compared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev&#x27;s 1869 list misplaces seven then known elements: indium, thorium, and five rare-earth metals: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, erbium, and didymium. The last two were later found to be mixtures of two different elements; ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev as they did not show a regular increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights. Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series. In early 1870, he decided that the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare-earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increased their predicted atomic weights by half). He measured the heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their higher assumed valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist Robert Bunsen). Mendeleev treated the change by assessing each element to an individual place in his system of the elements rather than continuing to treat them as a series.

Mendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between cerium and tantalum with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew tungsten). This row would begin with a trivalent lanthanum, a tetravalent cerium, and a pentavalent didymium. However, the higher valency for didymium had not been established, and Mendeleev tried to do so himself. Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare-earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of luminiferous ether. His idea was carried on by Austrian-Hungarian chemist Bohuslav Brauner, who sought to find a place in the periodic table for the rare-earth metals; Mendeleev later referred to him as to &quot;one of the true consolidators of the periodic law&quot;.

In addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev&#x27;s 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties. In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.

=== Priority of discovery ===
None of the proposals were accepted immediately, and many contemporary chemists found it too abstract to have any meaningful value. Of those chemists that proposed their categorizations, Mendeleev strove to back his work and promote his vision of periodicity, Meyer did not promote his work very actively, and Newlands did not make a single attempt to gain recognition abroad.

Both Mendeleev and Meyer created their respective tables for their pedagogical needs; the difference between their tables is well explained by the fact that the two chemists sought to use a formalized system to solve different problems. Mendeleev&#x27;s intent was to aid composition of his textbook, &quot;Foundations of Chemistry&quot;, whereas Meyer was rather concerned with presentation of theories. Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions emerged outside of the pedagogical scope in the realm of journal science, while Meyer made no predictions at all and explicitly stated his table and his textbook it was contained in, &quot;Modern Theories&quot;, should not be used for prediction in order to make the point to his students to not make too many purely theoretically constructed projections.

Mendeleev and Meyer differed in temperament, at least when it came to promotion of their respective works. Boldness of Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions was noted by some contemporary chemists, however skeptical they may have been. Meyer referred to Mendeleev&#x27;s &quot;boldness&quot; in an edition of &quot;Modern Theories&quot;, whereas Mendeleev mocked Meyer&#x27;s indecisiveness to predict in an edition of &quot;Foundations of Chemistry&quot;.

=== Recognition of Mendeleev&#x27;s table ===
Eventually, the periodic table was appreciated for its descriptive power and for finally systematizing the relationship between the elements, although such appreciation was not universal. In 1881, Mendeleev and Meyer had an argument via an exchange of articles in British journal &quot;Chemical News&quot; over priority of the periodic table, which included an article from Mendeleev, one from Meyer, one of critique of the notion of periodicity, and many more. In 1882, the Royal Society in London awarded the Davy Medal to both Mendeleev and Meyer for their work to classify the elements; although two of Mendeleev&#x27;s predicted elements had been discovered by then, Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions were not at all mentioned in the prize rationale.

Mendeleev&#x27;s &quot;eka-aluminium&quot; was discovered in 1875 and became known as gallium; &quot;eka-boron&quot; and &quot;eka-silicium&quot; were discovered in 1879 and 1886, respectively, and were named scandium and germanium. Mendeleev was even able to correct some initial measurements with his predictions, including the first prediction of gallium, which matched &quot;eka-aluminium&quot; fairly closely but had a different density. Mendeleev advised the discoverer, French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, to measure the density again; de Boisbaudran was initially skeptical (not least because he thought Mendeleev was trying to take credit from him) but eventually admitted the correctness of the prediction. Mendeleev contacted all three discoverers; all three noted the close similarity of their discovered elements with Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions, with the last of them, German chemist Clemens Winkler, admitting this suggestion was not first made by Mendeleev or himself after the correspondence with him, but by a different person, German chemist Hieronymous Theodor Richter. Some contemporary chemists were not convinced by these discoveries, noting the dissimilarities between the new elements and the predictions or claiming those similarities that did exist were coincidental. However, success of Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions helped spread the word about his periodic table. Later, chemists used the successes of these Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions to justify his table.

By 1890, Mendeleev&#x27;s periodic table had been universally recognized as a piece of basic chemical knowledge. Apart from his own correct predictions, a number of aspects may have contributed to this, such as the correct accommodation of many elements whose atomic weights were thought to have wrong values but were later corrected. The debate on the position of the rare-earth metals helped spur the discussion about the table as well. In 1889, Mendeleev noted at the Faraday Lecture to the Royal Institution in London that he had not expected to live long enough &quot;to mention their discovery to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude and generality of the periodic law&quot;.

== Inert gases and ether ==
=== Inert gases ===
British chemist Henry Cavendish, the discoverer of hydrogen in 1766, discovered that air is composed of more gases than nitrogen and oxygen. He recorded these findings in 1784 and 1785; among them, he found a then-unidentified gas less reactive than nitrogen. Helium was first reported in 1868; the report was based on the new technique of spectroscopy; some spectral lines in light emitted by the Sun did not match those of any of the known elements. Mendeleev was not convinced by this finding since variance of temperature led to change of intensity of spectral lines and their location on the spectrum. This opinion was held by some other scientists of the day, some of whom believed the spectral lines were due to a particular state of hydrogen existing in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. Others believed the spectral lines could belong to an element that occurred on the Sun but not on Earth; some believed it was yet to be found on Earth.

In 1894, British chemist William Ramsay and British physicist Lord Rayleigh isolated argon from air and determined that it was a new element. Argon, however, did not engage in any chemical reactions and was—highly unusually for a gas—monatomic; it did not fit into the periodic law and thus challenged the very notion of it. Not all scientists immediately accepted this report; Mendeleev&#x27;s original response was that argon was a triatomic form of nitrogen rather than an element of its own. While the notion of a possibility of a group between that of halogens and that of alkali metals had existed (some scientists believed that several atomic weight values between halogens and alkali metals were missing, especially since places in this half of group VIII remained vacant), argon did not easily match the position between chlorine and potassium because its atomic weight exceeded those of both chlorine and potassium. Other explanations were proposed; for example, Ramsay supposed argon could be a mixture of different gases. For a while, Ramsay believed argon could be a mixture of three gases of similar atomic weights; this triad would resemble the triad of iron, cobalt, and nickel, and be similarly placed in group VIII. Certain that shorter periods contain triads of gases at their ends, Ramsay suggested in 1898 the existence of a gas between helium and argon with an atomic weight of 20; after its discovery later that year (it was named neon), Ramsay continued to interpret it as a member of a horizontal triad at the end of that period.

In 1896, Ramsay tested a report of American chemist William Francis Hillebrand, who found a stream of an unreactive gas from a sample of uraninite. Wishing to prove it was nitrogen, Ramsay analyzed a different uranium mineral, cleveite, and found a new element, which he named krypton. This finding was corrected by British chemist William Crookes, who matched its spectrum to that of the Sun&#x27;s helium. Following this discovery, Ramsay, using fractional distillation to separate the components air, discovered several more such gases in 1898: metargon, krypton, neon, and xenon; detailed spectroscopic analysis of the first of these demonstrated it was argon contaminated by a carbon-based impurity. Ramsay was initially skeptical about the existence of gases heavier than argon, and the discovery of krypton and xenon came as a surprise to him; however, Ramsay accepted his own discovery, and the five newly discovered inert gases (now noble gases) were placed in a single column in the periodic table. Although Mendeleev&#x27;s table predicted several undiscovered elements, it did not predict the existence of such inert gases, and Mendeleev originally rejected those findings as well.

=== Changes to the periodic table ===
Although the sequence of atomic weights suggested that inert gases should be located between halogens and alkali metals, and there were suggestions to put them into group VIII coming from as early as 1895, such placement contradicted one of Mendeleev&#x27;s basic considerations, that of the highest oxides. Inert gases did not form any oxides, and no other compounds at all, and as such, their placement in a group where elements should form tetroxides was seen as merely auxiliary and not natural; Mendeleev doubted inclusion of those elements in group VIII. Later developments, particularly by British scientists, focused on correspondence of inert gases with halogens to their left and alkali metals to their right. In 1898, when only helium, argon, and krypton were definitively known, Crookes suggested these elements be placed in a single column between the hydrogen group and the fluorine group. In 1900, at the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Ramsay and Mendeleev discussed the new inert gases and their location in the periodic table; Ramsay proposed that these elements be put in a new group between halogens and alkali metals, to which Mendeleev agreed. Ramsay published an article after his discussions with Mendeleev; the tables in it featured halogens to the left of inert gases and alkali metals to the right. Two weeks before that discussion, Belgian botanist Léo Errera had proposed to the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium to put those elements in a new group 0. In 1902, Mendeleev wrote that those elements should be put in a new group 0; he said this idea was consistent with what Ramsay suggested to him and referred to Errera as to the first person to suggest the idea. Mendeleev himself added these elements to the table as group 0 in 1902, without disturbing the basic concept of the periodic table.

In 1905, Swiss chemist Alfred Werner resolved the dead zone of Mendeleev&#x27;s table. He determined that the rare-earth elements (lanthanides), 13 of which were known, lay within that gap. Although Mendeleev knew of lanthanum, cerium, and erbium, they were previously unaccounted for in the table because their total number and exact order were not known; Mendeleev still could not fit them in his table by 1901. This was in part a consequence of their similar chemistry and the imprecise determination of their atomic masses. Combined with the lack of a known group of similar elements, this rendered the placement of the lanthanides in the periodic table difficult. This discovery led to a restructuring of the table and the first appearance of the 32-column form.

=== Ether ===
By 1904, Mendeleev&#x27;s table rearranged several elements, and included the noble gases along with most other newly discovered elements. It still had the dead zone, and a row zero was added above hydrogen and helium to include coronium and the ether, which were widely believed to be elements at the time. Although the Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887 cast doubt on the possibility of a luminiferous ether as a space-filling medium, physicists set constraints for its properties. Mendeleev believed it to be a very light gas, with an atomic weight several orders of magnitude smaller than that of hydrogen. He also postulated that it would rarely interact with other elements, similar to the noble gases of his group zero, and instead permeate substances at a velocity of per second.

Mendeleev was not satisfied with the lack of understanding of the nature of this periodicity; this would only be possible through the understanding of the composition of the atom. However, Mendeleev firmly believed that future would only develop the notion rather than challenge it and reaffirmed his belief in writing in 1902.

==Atomic theory and isotopes==
=== Radioactivity and isotopes ===

In 1907 it was discovered that thorium and radiothorium, products of radioactive decay, were physically different but chemically identical; this led Frederick Soddy to propose in 1910 that they were the same element but with different atomic weights. Soddy later proposed to call these elements with complete chemical identity &quot;isotopes&quot;.

The problem of placing isotopes in the periodic table had arisen beginning in 1900 when four radioactive elements were known: radium, actinium, thorium, and uranium. These radioactive elements (termed &quot;radioelements&quot;) were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the decay chains of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas radon, and their chemical properties were investigated. By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist Bertram Boltwood proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead. These were thought at the time to be new chemical elements, substantially increasing the number of known &quot;elements&quot; and leading to speculations that their discoveries would undermine the concept of the periodic table which had long been established to obey the octet rule. For example, there was not enough room between lead and uranium to accommodate these discoveries, even assuming that some discoveries were duplicates or incorrect identifications. It was also believed that radioactive decay violated one of the central principles of the periodic table, namely that chemical elements could not undergo transmutations and always had unique identities.

Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans, who had been following these developments, published in 1913 that although these substances emitted different radiation, many of these substances were identical in their chemical characteristics, so shared the same place in the periodic table. They became known as isotopes, from the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;same place&quot;). Austrian chemist Friedrich Paneth cited a difference between &quot;real elements&quot; (elements) and &quot;simple substances&quot; (isotopes), also determining that the existence of different isotopes was mostly irrelevant in determining chemical properties.

Following British physicist Charles Glover Barkla&#x27;s discovery of characteristic X-rays emitted from metals in 1906, British physicist Henry Moseley considered a possible correlation between X-ray emissions and physical properties of elements. Moseley, along with Charles Galton Darwin, Niels Bohr, and George de Hevesy, proposed that the nuclear charge (&quot;Z&quot;) might be mathematically related to physical properties. The significance of these atomic properties was determined in the Geiger–Marsden experiments, in which the atomic nucleus and its charge were discovered, conducted between 1908 and 1913.

=== Rutherford model and atomic number ===
In 1913, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek was the first to propose that the atomic number (nuclear charge) determined the placement of elements in the periodic table. He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 (tin), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.

Moseley was determined to test Van den Broek&#x27;s hypothesis. After a year of investigation of the Fraunhofer lines of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray wavelength of an element and its atomic number. With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley&#x27;s research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place argon (&quot;Z&quot; = 18) before potassium (&quot;Z&quot; = 19), cobalt (&quot;Z&quot; = 27) before nickel (&quot;Z&quot; = 28), as well as tellurium (&quot;Z&quot; = 52) before iodine (&quot;Z&quot; = 53), in line with periodic trends. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare-earth elements; it was also used to confirm that Georges Urbain&#x27;s claimed discovery of a new rare-earth element (celtium) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.

Swedish physicist Karl Siegbahn continued Moseley&#x27;s work for elements heavier than gold (&quot;Z&quot; = 79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, uranium, had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium), 72 (hafnium), 75 (rhenium), 85 (astatine), and 87 (francium).

=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===
In 1888, Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg working from the 1885 Balmer formula noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2·12, 10 = 2(12 + 22), 18 = 2(12 + 22 + 22), 36 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32), 54 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32 + 32), 86 = 2(12 + 22 + 22 + 32 + 32 + 42). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table, in group 0, to the right, in group VIII. Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the octet rule originally referred to as Abegg&#x27;s Rule of 1904. Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the valence bond theory, published in 1916 by American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis and the octet theory of chemical bonding, published in 1919 by American chemist Irving Langmuir. The chemists&#x27; approach during the period of the Old Quantum Theory (1913 to 1925) was incorporated into the understanding of the electron shells and orbitals under current quantum mechanics. A real pioneer who gave us the foundation for our current model of electrons is Irving Langmuir. In his 1919 paper, he postulated the existence of &quot;cells&quot;, which we now call orbitals, which could each only contain two electrons, and these were arranged in &quot;equidistant layers&quot; which we now call shells. He made an exception for the first shell to only contain two electrons. These postulates were introduced on the basis of Rydberg&#x27;s rule which Niels Bohr had used not in chemistry, but in physics, to apply to the orbits of electrons around the nucleus. In the Langmuir paper, he introduced the rule as 2N2 where N was a positive integer.

The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury made the next major step toward our modern theory in 1921, by suggesting that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations. Bury&#x27;s scheme was built upon that of earlier chemists and was a chemical model. Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valency electrons in their outer shell. In some early papers, the model was called the &quot;Bohr-Bury Atom&quot;. He introduced the word &quot;transition&quot; to describe the elements now known as transition metals or transition elements.

In the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into quantum mechanics led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. In the 19th century, Mendeleev had already asserted that there was a fixed periodicity of eight, and expected a mathematical correlation between atomic number and chemical properties. The Bohr model was developed beginning 1913, and championed the idea of electron configurations that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled valence shells; this forms the basis of the modern octet rule. Bohr&#x27;s study of spectroscopy and chemistry was not usual among theoretical atomic physicists. Even Rutherford told Bohr that he was struggling &quot;to form an idea of how you arrive at your conclusions&quot;. This is because none of the quantum mechanical equations describe the number of electrons per shell and orbital. Bohr acknowledged that he was influenced by the work of Walther Kossel, who in 1916 was the first to establish an important connection between the quantum atom and the periodic table. He noticed that the difference between the atomic numbers 2, 10, 18 of the first three noble gases, helium, neon, argon, was 8, and argued that the electrons in such atoms orbited in &quot;closed shells&quot;. The first contained only 2 electrons, the second and third, 8 each. Bohr&#x27;s research then led Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli to investigate the length of periods in the periodic table in 1924. Pauli demonstrated that this was not the case. Instead, the Pauli exclusion principle was developed, not upon a mathematical basis, but upon the previous developments in alignment with chemistry. This rule states that no electrons can coexist in the same quantum state, and showed, in conjunction with empirical observations, the existence of four quantum numbers and the consequence on the order of shell filling. This determines the order in which electron shells are filled and explains the periodicity of the periodic table.

British chemist Charles Bury is credited with the first use of the term &quot;transition metal&quot; in 1921 to refer to elements between the main-group elements of groups II and III. He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis, suggested the appearance of the &quot;d&quot; subshell in period 4 and the &quot;f&quot; subshell in period 6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements, thus explaining the position of the lanthanides in the periodic table.

=== Proton and neutron ===
The discovery of proton and neutron demonstrated that an atom was divisible; this rendered Lavoisier&#x27;s definition of a chemical element obsolete. A chemical element is defined today as a species of atoms with a consistent number of protons and that number is now known to be precisely the atomic number of an element. The discovery also explained the mechanism of several types of radioactive decay, such as alpha decay.

Eventually, it was proposed that protons and neutrons were made of even smaller particles called quarks; their discovery explained the transmutation of neutrons into protons in beta decay.

==From short form into long form (into -A and -B groups)==

Circa 1925, the periodic table changed by shifting some &quot;Reihen&quot; (series) to the right, into an extra set of columns (groups). The original groups I–VII were repeated, distinguished by adding &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Group VIII (with three columns) remained sole.

Thus, &quot;Reihen&quot; 4 and 5 were shifted, and together formed new &quot;period&quot; 4 with groups IA–VIIA, VIII, IB–VIIB.

==Later expansions and the end of the periodic table==

=== Actinides ===
As early as 1913, Bohr&#x27;s research on electronic structure led physicists such as Johannes Rydberg to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the seventh period should resemble those in the sixth. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare-earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from actinium to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high oxidation states; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.

In 1940, neptunium and plutonium were the first transuranic elements to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath rhenium and osmium, respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table. During his Manhattan Project research in 1943, American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements americium and curium, as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals. Seaborg wondered if these elements belonged to a different series, which would explain why their chemical properties, in particular the instability of higher oxidation states, were different from predictions. In 1945, against the advice of colleagues, he proposed a significant change to Mendeleev&#x27;s table: the actinide series.

Seaborg&#x27;s actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure proposed that the actinides form an inner transition series analogous to the rare-earth series of lanthanide elements—they would comprise the second row of the f-block (the 5f series), in which the lanthanides formed the 4f series. This facilitated chemical identification of americium and curium, and further experiments corroborated Seaborg&#x27;s hypothesis; a spectroscopic study at the Los Alamos National Laboratory by a group led by American physicist Edwin McMillan indicated that 5f orbitals, rather than 6d orbitals, were indeed being filled. However, these studies could not unambiguously determine the first element with 5f electrons and therefore the first element in the actinide series; it was thus also referred to as the &quot;thoride&quot; or &quot;uranide&quot; series until it was later found that the series began with actinium.

In light of these observations and an apparent explanation for the chemistry of transuranic elements, and despite fear among his colleagues that it was a radical idea that would ruin his reputation, Seaborg nevertheless submitted it to &quot;Chemical &amp; Engineering News&quot; and it gained widespread acceptance; new periodic tables thus placed the actinides below the lanthanides. Following its acceptance, the actinide concept proved pivotal in the groundwork for discoveries of heavier elements, such as berkelium in 1949. It also supported experimental results for a trend towards +3 oxidation states in the elements beyond americium—a trend observed in the analogous 4f series.

=== Relativistic effects and expansions beyond period 7 ===
Seaborg&#x27;s subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements from 104 to 121 and a superactinide series of elements from 122 to 153. He proposed an extended periodic table with an additional period of 50 elements (thus reaching element 168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the Aufbau principle and placed elements 121 to 138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled. Seaborg&#x27;s model, however, did not take into account relativistic effects resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed. Burkhard Fricke in 1971 and Pekka Pyykkö in 2010 used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to &quot;Z&quot; = 172, and found that the positions of several elements were different from those predicted by Seaborg. Although models from Pyykkö and Fricke generally place element 172 as the next noble gas, there is no clear consensus on the electron configurations of elements beyond 120 and thus their placement in an extended periodic table. It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.

The discovery of tennessine in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period. Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.

Despite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at University of California, Berkeley observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and between dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups 4 and 5. More recent experiments on copernicium and flerovium have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas radon rather than mercury and lead, their respective congeners. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.

<text>A club (also known as a cudgel, baton, bludgeon, truncheon, cosh, nightstick, or impact weapon) is a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a weapon or tool since prehistory. There are several examples of blunt-force trauma caused by clubs in the past, including at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, described as the scene of a prehistoric conflict between bands of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.

Most clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand, although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective. Various specialized clubs are used in martial arts and other fields, including the law-enforcement baton. The military mace is a more sophisticated descendant of the club, typically made of metal and featuring a spiked, knobbed, or flanged head attached to a shaft.

Examples of cultural depictions of clubs may be found in mythology, where they are associated with strong figures such as Hercules or the Japanese oni, or in popular culture, where they are associated with primitive cultures, especially cavemen. Ceremonial maces may also be displayed as a symbol of governmental authority.

The wounds inflicted by a club are generally known as &quot;strike trauma&quot; or &quot;blunt-force trauma&quot; injuries.

==Law enforcement==
Police forces and their predecessors have traditionally favored the use, whenever possible, of less lethal weapons than guns or blades. Until recent times, when alternatives such as tasers and capsicum spray became available, this category of policing weapon has generally been filled by some form of wooden club variously termed a truncheon, baton, nightstick, or lathi. Short, flexible clubs are also often used, especially by plainclothes officers who need to avoid notice. These are known colloquially as blackjacks, saps, or coshes.

Conversely, criminals have been known to arm themselves with an array of homemade or improvised clubs, generally of easily concealable sizes, or which can be explained as being carried for legitimate purposes (such as baseball bats).

In addition, Shaolin monks and members of other religious orders around the world have employed cudgels from time to time as defensive weapons.

==Types==
Though perhaps the simplest of all weapons, clubs come in many varieties, including:
* Aklys – a club with an integrated leather thong, used to return it to the hand after snapping it at an opponent. Used by the legions of the Roman Empire.
* Ball club – These clubs were used by Native Americans. There are two types; the stone ball clubs that were used mostly by early Plains, Plateau and Southwest Native Indians and the wooden ball clubs that the Huron and Iroquois tribes used. These consisted of a relatively free-moving head of rounded stone or wood attached to a wooden handle.
* Bang – Chinese military weapon type used in medieval times. Also used in modern Wushu showcase and martial-arts practice.
* Baseball, cricket and T-ball bats – The baseball bat is often used as an improvised weapon, much like the pickaxe handle. In countries where baseball is not commonly played, baseball bats are often first thought of as weapons. Tee ball bats are also used in this manner. Their smaller size and lighter weight make the bats easier to handle in one hand than a baseball bat. Cricket bats are heavier and their flat shape and short handle make them unwieldy as weapons, but they are more commonly available than baseball bats in some countries.
* Baton or truncheon – forms used by law enforcement.
* Blackjack or cosh – a weighted club designed to stun the subject.
* Bian – a tubular club used by medieval Chinese infantry and generals.
* Clava (full name &quot;clava mere okewa&quot;) – a traditional stone hand-club used by Mapuche Indians in Chile, featuring a long flat body. In Spanish, it is known as &quot;clava cefalomorfa&quot;. It has some ritual importance as a special sign of distinction carried by the tribal chief.
* Cudgel – A stout stick carried by peasants during the Middle Ages. It functioned as a walking staff and a weapon for both self-defence and wartime. Clubmen revolted in several localities against the excesses of soldiers on both sides during the English Civil War. During the 18th century singlestick fighting (a training sport for the use of the single handed backsword) was called singlesticking, or cudgel-play.
* Crowbar – a tool commonly used as an improvised weapon, though some examples are too large to be wielded with a single hand, and therefore should be classified as .
* Flashlight – A large metal flashlight, such as a Maglite, can make a very effective improvised club. Though not specifically classified as a weapon, it is often carried for self-defense by security guards, bouncers and civilians, especially in countries where carrying weapons is restricted.
* Gata – a Fijian war club
* Ghioagă – a Romanian club similar to a shillelagh; also called Bâtă (the name comes from Latin &quot;batt(u)ere&quot; – battery). This was used as a weapon in group fights against Ottoman Empire by irregular troops made up of peasants, vassals to local Princes in Wallachia and Moldavia. Early mentions of it occur from the 15th century in some historical sources.
* Gunstock war club – a war club stylized as the butt of a rifle
* Jiǎn – a type of quad-edged straight club specifically designed to break other weapons with sharp edges.
* Jutte or jitte – a distinctive weapon of the samurai police, consisting of an iron rod with a hook. It could parry and disarm a sword-wielding assailant without serious injury. Eventually, the jutte also came to be considered a symbol of official status.
* Kanabō (nyoibo, konsaibo, tetsubō, ararebo) – Various types of different-sized Japanese clubs made of wood and or iron, usually with iron spikes or studs. First used by the samurai.
* Kanak war clubs – traditional maces used by the Kanak people of New Caledonia
* Kiyoga – a spring baton similar in concept to the Asp collapsible police baton, but with the center section made of a heavy-duty steel spring. The tip and first section slide into the spring, and the whole nests into a seven-inch handle. To deploy the kiyoga, all that is necessary is to grasp the handle and swing. This causes the parts to extend from the handle into a baton seventeen inches long. The kiyoga has one advantage over a conventional collapsible baton: it can reach around a raised arm trying to block it to strike the head.

<doc id="619799" wikidata="Q2991905" url="?curid=619799" title="Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 77 (99), was originally composed by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1947–48. He was still working on the piece at the time of the Zhdanov Doctrine, and it could not be performed in the period following the composer&#x27;s denunciation. In the time between the work&#x27;s initial completion and the first performance, the composer, sometimes with the collaboration of its dedicatee, David Oistrakh, worked on several revisions. The concerto was finally premiered by the Leningrad Philharmonic under Yevgeny Mravinsky on 29 October 1955. It was well-received, Oistrakh remarking on the &quot;depth of its artistic content&quot; and describing the violin part as a &quot;pithy &#x27;Shakespearian&#x27; role.&quot;

The concerto is sometimes denoted with the Opus number 99 as it was written in 1947–48 but without a premiere at the time because of the use of Jewish themes and Shostakovich troubles with the government at the time. The concerto had its premiere seven years later, in which time Shostakovich had written other pieces, hence the difference.

Oistrakh characterized the first movement Nocturne as &quot;a suppression of feelings,&quot; and the second movement Scherzo as &quot;demonic.&quot; The Scherzo is also notable for an appearance by the DSCH motif—a motif representing Shostakovich himself that recurs in many of the composer&#x27;s works. Boris Schwarz (&quot;Music and Musical Life in Soviet Russia&quot;, 1972) commented on the Passacaglia&#x27;s &quot;lapidary grandeur&quot; and the Burlesque&#x27;s &quot;devil-may-care abandonment.&quot;

==Structure==
The concerto lasts around 35 minutes and comprises four movements, with a cadenza linking the final two:
==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for solo violin, three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, tuba, timpani, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, celesta, two harps, and strings.
Unusually, the score does not include trumpets or trombones.

==Opus number==
Shostakovich catalogued this concerto as Opus 77, but because of the delay in performance he originally published it as Opus 99. Opus 77 was originally assigned to the &quot;Three Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, an unpublished and unperformed orchestral work.

==David Oistrakh and premiere==
The First Violin Concerto was written for David Oistrakh; Shostakovich played through the work for him in 1948. In the intervening years, the concerto was edited by Shostakovich with the collaboration of Oistrakh. Oistrakh performed the concerto&#x27;s premiere on 29 October 1955 with the Leningrad Philharmonic with Yevgeny Mravinsky conducting. It was received in Russia and abroad as an &quot;extraordinary success.&quot;

==Analysis==

The First Violin Concerto was composed through the campaign against formalism in music, during which Shostakovich was among six composers censured. Because of this hostile environment, Shostakovich kept the concerto unpublished until Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953 and the thaw that followed. Music historian Boris Schwarz notes that during the post-war years, Shostakovich divided his music into two idioms. The first was &quot;simplified and accessible to comply with Kremlin guidelines,&quot; while the second was &quot;complex and abstract to satisfy [Shostakovich&#x27;s] own artistic standards.&quot; Given its complex nature, the First Violin Concerto falls into the second category and, as such, was not premiered until 1955.

Because of the delay before its premiere, it is unknown whether or not the concerto was composed before the Tenth Symphony (1953). While the Symphony is generally thought to have been the first work that introduces Shostakovich&#x27;s famous DSCH motif, it is possible that the First Violin Concerto was the first instance of the motif, where it appears in the second movement. The letters DSCH are arranged in a German &#x27;spelling&#x27; of the composer&#x27;s initials on the staff in an inversion of a [0134] tetrachord and are usually arranged as close together pitch-wise as possible. Shostakovich uses this theme in many of his works to represent himself.

The Concerto is symphonic in form, adopting the four-movement form of the symphony. The first movement, a dark, brooding, elegiac nocturne, elaborates on a fantasy form. The violin solo is prefaced by a brief orchestral interlude that proposes the melodic sentence upon which the violin solo later meditates, adding rhythmic and melodic motifs as the movement progresses. The movement starts pianissimo, and by the time it reaches its first dynamic peak, all of the featured melodic and rhythmic information has been presented.

The second movement is a fugal Scherzo, featuring uneven metric stresses set against a steady rhythmic pulse. 

The Passacaglia follows, which ends with an extended cadenza that leads without pause into the Burlesque finale.

<doc id="619801" wikidata="Q2454245" url="?curid=619801" title="DES-X">
<text>In cryptography, DES-X (or DESX) is a variant on the DES (Data Encryption Standard) symmetric-key block cipher intended to increase the complexity of a brute-force attack. The technique used to increase the complexity is called &quot;key whitening&quot;.

The original DES algorithm was specified in 1976 with a 56-bit key size: 256 possibilities for the key. There was criticism that an exhaustive search might be within the capabilities of large governments, particularly the United States&#x27; National Security Agency (NSA). One scheme to increase the key size of DES without substantially altering the algorithm was DES-X, proposed by Ron Rivest in May 1984.

The algorithm has been included in RSA Security&#x27;s BSAFE cryptographic library since the late 1980s.

DES-X augments DES by XORing an extra 64 bits of key (K1) to the plaintext &quot;before&quot; applying DES, and then XORing another 64 bits of key (K2) &quot;after&quot; the encryption:

formula_1

The key size is thereby increased to 56 + (2 × 64) = 184 bits.

However, the effective key size (security) is only increased to 56+64−1−&quot;lb(M)&quot; = 119 − &quot;lb(M)&quot; = ~119 bits, where &quot;M&quot; is the number of chosen plaintext/ciphertext pairs the adversary can obtain, and &quot;lb&quot; denotes the binary logarithm. Moreover, effective key size drops to 88 bits given 232.5 known plaintext and using advanced slide attack.

DES-X also increases the strength of DES against differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, although the improvement is much smaller than in the case of brute force attacks. It is estimated that differential cryptanalysis would require 261 chosen plaintexts (vs. 247 for DES), while linear cryptanalysis would require 260 known plaintexts (vs. 243 for DES or 261 for DES with independent subkeys.) Note that with 264 plaintexts (known or chosen being the same in this case), DES (or indeed any other block cipher with a 64 bit block size) is totally broken as the whole cipher&#x27;s codebook becomes available.

Although the differential and linear attacks, currently best attack on DES-X is a known-plaintext slide attack
discovered by Biryukov-Wagner which has complexity of 232.5 known plaintexts and 287.5 time of analysis. Moreover the attack is easily converted into a ciphertext-only attack with the same data complexity and 295 offline time complexity.

<doc id="619802" wikidata="Q284854" url="?curid=619802" title="Out of Time (album)">
<text>Out of Time is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on March 12, 1991, by Warner Bros. Records. With &quot;Out of Time&quot;, R.E.M.&#x27;s status grew from that of a cult band to a massive international act. The record topped the album sales charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom, spending 109 weeks on U.S. album charts, with two separate spells at the top, and spending 183 weeks on the British charts, including one week at the top. The album has sold more than four and a half million copies in the United States and more than 18 million copies worldwide. &quot;Out of Time&quot; won three Grammy Awards in 1992: one as Best Alternative Music Album, and two for its first single, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;.

==Details==
&quot;Out of Time&quot; combines elements of pop, folk and classical music heard on the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Green&quot;, with a new concentration on country elements that would continue on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. It features guest appearances by KRS-One and Kate Pierson from The B-52&#x27;s.

Preceded by the release of &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, which became R.E.M.&#x27;s biggest U.S. hit, &quot;Out of Time&quot; gave them their first U.S. and UK No. 1 album. The band did not tour to support the release, although they did make occasional appearances on television or at festivals. In Germany, it is the band&#x27;s best-selling album, selling more than 1,250,000 copies, reaching 5× gold. &quot;Out of Time&quot; was the first R.E.M. album to have an alternative expanded release on CD, including expanded liner notes and postcards. In Spain, a contest was held to have a limited-edition cover, with the winner being an abstract oil painting.

For the 25th anniversary the album was remastered. The standard version of the reissue comes with a second disc of demos, the deluxe version adds a third disc featuring live acoustic tracks. It was released through Concord Records on November 18, 2016.

=== Time Side ===

==== &quot;Radio Song&quot; ====
&quot;Radio Song&quot; opens &quot;Out of Time&quot; with an unconventional introduction featuring KRS-One of Boogie Down Productions, whose spoken word segment sets the tone: &quot;Hey, I can&#x27;t find nothing on the radio. Yo, turn to that station.&quot; The band&#x27;s characteristic sound—Peter Buck&#x27;s ringing guitar, Mike Mills&#x27; bass, and Michael Stipe&#x27;s vocals—enters only after this opening gambit, with Stipe singing about the world &quot;collapsing around our ears.&quot; The track then transitions into a funk-influenced groove, a style R.E.M. had not explored in such depth since &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get There From Here&quot;. KRS-One contributes a rap that both Stipe and Bill Berry credit with revitalizing the song. While initially intended only to provide vocal interjections, KRS-One developed a full rap that aligned with the song&#x27;s critique of radio programming. Stipe, a fan of Boogie Down Productions&#x27; &quot;Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop&quot;, noted that KRS-One&#x27;s contributions were fueled by shared frustrations with the radio industry. Other guest performers on the track include Peter Holsapple on additional bass, Kidd Jordan on tenor, alto, and baritone saxophones, and strings arranged by Mark Bingham. Producer Scott Litt added echo and tape loop effects.

Musically, the track features Mills on Hammond organ, which evokes the sound of a classic Stax recording according to Craig Rosen in &quot;R.E.M. Inside Out: The Stories Behind Every Song&quot;, complemented by Buck&#x27;s funky, minimalist guitar riffs and Berry&#x27;s syncopated drumming. Stipe&#x27;s vocal delivery alternates between heartfelt and humorous, reflecting the song&#x27;s critique of formulaic radio playlists. Lyrically, &quot;Radio Song&quot; protests the repetitive and uninspired nature of commercial radio, a theme underscored by Berry&#x27;s pointed comment that &quot;We don&#x27;t owe radio shit&quot; due to the band&#x27;s early struggles for airplay. Stipe, however, viewed the song with a lighter perspective, calling it a humorous critique, including his own performance. He hoped listeners would grasp the irony in his dramatic opening plea about the collapsing world and KRS-One&#x27;s thought-provoking rap. An alternate version of the song, the &quot;Tower of Luv Bug Mix&quot; remixed by Herby &quot;Luvbug&quot; Azor, was included on a promotional CD single. This mix added spoken-word radio parody elements, female backing vocals, and jazzy instrumentation.

==== &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; ====
&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; emerged from an initial idea by Buck. He experimented with a mandolin while drinking beer and watching a baseball game, recording the result on a boom box. During rehearsals, the band worked on this initial idea, with Berry initially playing bass before switching to drums. The song developed into a full band arrangement, with Buck on mandolin and electric octave guitar, Mike Mills on bass and keyboard strings, Berry on drums and percussion, and Peter Holsapple on acoustic guitar. When previewed live at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia, the band performed it acoustically without Berry.

Stipe described &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; as &quot;a classic obsession song&quot;, explaining that it explores themes of unrequited love, though he was quick to deny any autobiographical connection. Instead, Stipe suggested the song was written as an extension of &quot;World Leader Pretend&quot; and composed from an &quot;everyman&quot; perspective, reflecting on significant revelations and the changes they bring. Despite this, lines like &quot;That&#x27;s me in the corner / That&#x27;s me in the spotlight&quot; have often been interpreted as deeply personal, leading to speculation about Stipe&#x27;s own psyche. In 1991, Buck remarked to &quot;the Independent&quot; that the song seemed autobiographical, a claim Stipe resisted. Another popular theory that circulated after the song&#x27;s release was that it reflects the perspective of Mark David Chapman during his assassination of John Lennon. Nevertheless, Stipe has maintained that the song&#x27;s themes are broader, drawing on universal experiences of vulnerability and obsession rather than specific personal or historical events.

==== &quot;Low&quot; ====
&quot;Low&quot; features an organ played by Mike Mills as its musical foundation, described by Stipe as evoking the atmosphere of a funeral parlor. Often performed during the &quot;Green&quot; tour, &quot;Low&quot; was among the earliest songs completed for the album. Its instrumentation includes Mills on organ, Berry on congas, Buck on guitar, Holsapple on bass, and additional string arrangements by Bingham. The song&#x27;s lyrics reflect Stipe&#x27;s critical perspective on love songs, particularly in the lines, &quot;I skipped the part about love / It seemed so silly, it seemed so shallow.&quot; While Stipe generally avoided using the word &quot;love&quot; in his songwriting, he reintroduced it in &quot;Low,&quot; marking the first instance since &quot;The One I Love&quot;. Stipe noted that the song hinges on the word &quot;time,&quot; particularly in the final verse: &quot;You and me, we know about time.&quot;

==== &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; ====
&quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot;, described as a Beach Boys-influenced pop song, is one of two tracks on the album featuring Mills as the primary vocalist, with Buck noting it functions as a duet between Mills and Stipe, who co-wrote the lyrics. Buck acknowledged the influence of the Beach Boys on the track, citing their albums &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; as sources of inspiration during the recording process. He noted that Capitol Records had recently released a series of Beach Boys reissues with outtakes, which he listened to extensively. Buck explained that he suggested the song&#x27;s high harmony part to evoke the Beach Boys&#x27; style. Both Mills and Bill Berry also shared a history of singing along to the Beach Boys&#x27; music while driving around Macon, Georgia. Despite this influence, Stipe stated that he was not a fan of the Beach Boys, describing his limited experience with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as unconvincing, even as he acknowledged Brian Wilson&#x27;s talent.

==== &quot;Endgame&quot; ====
&quot;Endgame&quot; is an instrumental track with Stipe contributing wordless &quot;la la las&quot; over its orchestral arrangement. The piece, described by Peter Buck as an &quot;end title sequence&quot;, was conceived to evoke the atmosphere of a film&#x27;s closing theme. Buck stated, &quot;It sounds like the movie&#x27;s over, and that&#x27;s the last theme.&quot; Stipe offered a different visual interpretation, imagining Buck on a grand stage, surrounded by classically trained musicians, playing guitar as the music swirls around him &quot;like the ocean.&quot; The song marked Buck&#x27;s first substantial effort in composing with live musicians. He replaced most of his original vocal melodies with instrumental lines, retaining his voice only for the opening verse. Stipe chose not to write lyrics for the track, explaining that imposing words would limit its interpretive possibilities, reducing its emotional scope. He commented, &quot;Music has its shifts and ebb and flow, but the minute you put a word on it, you’ve truncated it, tunnel-visioned it into something.&quot;

The recording featured several collaborators. Cecil Welch, a flugelhorn player known for his work with Henry Mancini, contributed a horn part that Stipe wrote, which he said sounded remarkably like a Mancini composition. Stipe described the experience of working with Welch as a thrill, citing his admiration for Mancini&#x27;s work. In addition to Welch, the track incorporated strings arranged by Stipe and Mark Bingham. Other instrumentation included percussion by Berry, acoustic and electric guitars by Buck, bass and backing vocals by Mills, bass clarinet and tenor saxophone by Ralph Carney, and Stipe playing bass melodica. While &quot;Endgame&quot; features orchestral elements, Buck contrasted its approach to classical music with what he called the bombastic tendencies of his generation. He noted a preference for the intimacy of smaller string arrangements over the grandeur of large-scale orchestral references, adding that Endgame avoids the pretentiousness often associated with rock acts incorporating classical elements.

=== Memory Side ===

==== &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; ====

&quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, described by Buck as a &quot;silly, stupid little song&quot;, features a collaboration with Kate Pierson of the B-52s, marking R.E.M.&#x27;s first time working with her. Pierson&#x27;s contribution was highlighted as a major aspect of the track, with both Mills and Stipe praising the experience. Stipe referred to Pierson as &quot;probably my favorite female singer&quot;, while Mills called working with her a &quot;highlight&quot;. The recording features Buck on electric guitar, Mills playing upright bass, Berry contributing drums, and acoustic guitar provided by Holsapple. The song was recorded in one take, with Pierson and Stipe adding vocals shortly thereafter. Stipe described the song as &quot;the happiest song&quot; he had ever written, highlighting its lyrical construction with &quot;so many E sounds&quot; that he claimed make it impossible not to smile when singing it.

Musically, the song features a 3/4 waltz-time signature section in its introduction and middle, which Berry described as part of the band&#x27;s effort to keep their recordings interesting through experimentation. Berry viewed the unusual time signature as a way to challenge conventional pop song structures. In contrast, Mills expressed skepticism about mid-song time changes, remarking, &quot;I personally think that &#x27;Psychotic Reaction&#x27; is the only good song that changes time in the middle.&quot;

==== &quot;Belong&quot; ====
&quot;Belong&quot; features spoken word vocals by Michael Stipe, a stylistic choice previously explored on the alternate take of &quot;7 Chinese Bros.&quot; titled &quot;Voice of Harold&quot;. The track relies on background vocals by Mills and Berry. Stipe&#x27;s spoken vocal line was recorded using a Walkman in a three-car garage at a rental house rather than in the studio. Dissatisfied with the clarity of his studio-recorded vocals, Stipe borrowed producer Scott Litt&#x27;s Walkman to capture a rawer sound. The garage&#x27;s acoustics provided the desired reverb for the track, with Stipe later reflecting on the risk of recording near a tank of noxious gas.

The song&#x27;s lyrics introduce a woman and her child responding to an unspecified event. Stipe clarified that the woman&#x27;s act of opening a window is not violent, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not a song about defenestration.&quot; The event in question is described as something far away that profoundly impacts the woman, leading her to reflect on its significance to her child and herself. The lyrics also reference &quot;creatures&quot; that &quot;jumped the barricades&quot;, though the nature of these creatures remains ambiguous. Stipe once described &quot;Belong&quot; as &quot;probably the most political song on the record&quot;, though its political context is not explicit. In live performances, Stipe has introduced the song as addressing &quot;a more intimate type&quot; of war.

==== &quot;Half a World Away&quot; ====
&quot;Half a World Away&quot; opens with Michael Stipe singing the line, &quot;This could be the saddest dusk I&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; over a foundation of organ, acoustic guitar, and mandolin. The song conveys a melancholy tone, which Stipe has described in concert as &quot;the saddest song ever written&quot;. The track&#x27;s composition was influenced by Buck&#x27;s experiences playing with folk musicians during the recording period. Buck described these jam sessions as a departure from his rock background, involving traditional songs performed on porches. Though R.E.M.&#x27;s music is not traditional folk, Buck noted that some of these influences &quot;leaked through&quot; into their work, particularly in the acoustic instrumentation. He emphasized, however, that R.E.M.&#x27;s songs are more complex, using a greater number of chords and varied time signatures compared to traditional folk music. In addition to R.E.M.&#x27;s usual instrumentation, the track incorporates a harpsichord, played by Mike Mills, which adds a baroque quality to the arrangement. A string arrangement by Mark Bingham further enhances the song’s orchestral texture. While the song&#x27;s lyrics suggest a longing for a loved one, Stipe explained that &quot;Half a World Away&quot; is a &quot;complete fabrication&quot;, drawn from a mixture of personal knowledge, stories he heard, and things he saw on television. Despite its constructed narrative, Stipe acknowledged that there is an emotional core to the song.

==== &quot;Texarkana&quot; ====
&quot;Texarkana&quot; features Mills as the lead vocalist, with Stipe providing background vocals. Mills described the role reversal as enjoyable but noted that he would not want to take on lead vocal duties regularly. Despite the title referencing the city that straddles the border between Texas and Arkansas, the lyrics make no mention of Texarkana or its characteristics. Peter Buck explained that the song originally had lyrics written by Stipe that referenced Texarkana, but when Stipe was unable to complete them, Mills wrote new lyrics and recorded the vocal part in just half an hour. The original title was retained, even though it had no connection to the new lyrics. Musically, the track features a galloping bass line and a blend of real and synthesized strings, creating a melody that has been compared to the sound of the Moody Blues by Rosen. John Keane, a frequent collaborator with R.E.M., contributes pedal steel guitar to the song while Holsapple provides instrumental support.

==== &quot;Country Feedback&quot; ====
&quot;Country Feedback&quot; was recorded as a demo before formal sessions for the album began. According to Buck, the song was created quickly, with its initial recording taking only 35 minutes. Buck contributed acoustic guitar and &quot;loud guitar,&quot; while Bill Berry played bass and percussion. Mike Mills provided organ, Pierson contributed backing vocals that are barely audible in the mix, and Keane added pedal steel guitar.

The song&#x27;s title reflects its musical style, blending elements of country with feedback-laden instrumentation. Buck explained that the process began with four chords and a basic structure, to which Michael Stipe later added lyrics. While Buck initially claimed Stipe wrote the lyrics immediately, he later clarified that a day passed between the music&#x27;s creation and Stipe&#x27;s vocal contributions. Stipe employed what he called a &quot;projectile vomiting&quot; approach to lyric writing, using stream-of-consciousness techniques and sketching symbols, including an &quot;Indian head and an arrow&quot;, as visual cues during the process. The vocal delivery is described as bitter and desperate by Rosen, with Stipe at one point appearing to say &quot;Fuck off,&quot; though he clarified the lyric as &quot;Fuck all&quot;. Stipe characterized the song as a love song that explores the &quot;uglier side&quot; of a relationship, reflecting themes of desperation and resignation. Buck praised the lyrics as an authentic expression of Stipe&#x27;s emotions at the time of recording.

==== &quot;Me in Honey&quot; ====
&quot;Me in Honey&quot; originated from a simple one-chord riff played by Mills. Buck recalled to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that Mills&#x27;s riff was recorded as a short 30-second section at the end of a cassette featuring other songs. Stipe became fixated on the snippet and developed a complete song from it. Buck explained that the riff was divided into sections to create verses of varying lengths, and a single additional chord was introduced for the chorus at Stipe&#x27;s request. Stipe wrote the lyrics through a process of working out lines on paper, a development Buck described as surprising given the song&#x27;s minimal starting point.

Thematically, Stipe explained that &quot;Me in Honey&quot; serves as a response to 10,000 Maniacs&#x27; song &quot;Eat for Two&quot;, offering a male perspective on pregnancy. He described the song&#x27;s dynamic as grappling with conflicting emotions—on one hand, distancing himself from responsibility, and on the other, expressing personal feelings about the situation. Musically, &quot;Me in Honey&quot; features R.E.M.&#x27;s traditional instrumentation, with contributions from Pierson, whose voice opens and closes the track, as it does on the album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Radio Song&quot;. The band kept the arrangement straightforward, refraining from adding any additional instrumentation beyond Pierson&#x27;s vocals.

==Packaging==
Warner Bros. Records executive Jeff Gold, alongside Rock the Vote campaign co-founder and Virgin Records executive Jeff Ayeroff, approached R.E.M. in regards to printing a petition on the back of &quot;Out of Time&quot;&#x27;s CD longbox packaging in the United States, where buyers were encouraged to sign their name in support for Rock the Vote, who were in support of the Motor Voter Act to ease voter registration, and would allow voters &quot;to register through their local DMV&quot;. Gold reasoned, considering many of the album&#x27;s buyers would be young, that this could &quot;vote out&quot; the controversial Parents Music Resource Center music censorship bill, who &quot;put pressure on the creators and distributors of &#x27;objectionable&#x27; music&quot;, as well as make good use of the popular longbox packaging format of the day, which many artists and customers considered unnecessary and wasteful. Michael Stipe also appeared in a public service announcement for the campaign.

In July 2014, radio show &quot;99% Invisible&quot; said that because of this packaging, &quot;Out of Time&quot; is &quot;the most politically significant album in the history of the United States&quot;. They said that three weeks after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;they had received 10,000 petitions, 100 per senator, and they just kept coming in droves&quot;, and a month following its release, the campaign&#x27;s political director and members of KMD &quot;wheeled a shopping cart full of the first 10,000 petitions into a senate hearing&quot;. The bill was eventually passed in 1993 by Bill Clinton and was in effect January 1, 1995; one commentary later said this happened &quot;in no small part because of R.E.M.&#x27;s lobbying&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Out of Time&quot; received mostly positive reviews on release. Critics offered varied perspectives on the album, highlighting its experimentation and emotional depth. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the album &quot;R.E.M.&#x27;s most consistent effort since &quot;Reckoning&quot;&quot; and appreciated its use of strings, horns, and guest musicians, which &quot;accent the band&#x27;s melodic strengths&quot;. He described the album as &quot;a song cycle of love songs that sound intimate even in the wide open spaces of the arrangements&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne felt the album fell short of the band&#x27;s previous standards, stating that while &quot;strings, organs, and collaborations with rappers and the B-52&#x27;s&quot; gave the album a different texture, it &quot;never matches the vibrancy of the band&#x27;s earlier work.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Richard Cromelin observed that the album diverged from the sound of &quot;Green&quot;, noting that it &quot;draws a line between the bright polish of its radio-ready pop songs and the impressionistic allure of its more shadowy tracks.&quot; He acknowledged the string arrangements and moments where R.E.M. aimed to &quot;recapture the aura of their early mystique.&quot; Mark Cooper of &quot;Q&quot; agreed, highlighting Stipe&#x27;s vocals and the harmony singing while describing the album as a &quot;brooding departure [that] offers them at their most reflective, challenging and intriguing&quot;.

Terry Staunton of &quot;NME&quot; highlighted the album&#x27;s eclecticism, noting it &quot;veers from the playful exuberance of &#x27;Shiny Happy People&#x27; to the desolate beauty of &#x27;Country Feedback&#x27;&quot;. He concluded, &quot;This is a band growing older with dignity, without losing their sense of adventure.&quot; Parke Puterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the record for achieving a balance between new mainstream appeal and the band&#x27;s original identity, writing, &quot;R.E.M. have managed to simultaneously branch out and consolidate their strengths.&quot; David Cavanagh of &quot;Select&quot; labeled &quot;Out of Time&quot; the band&#x27;s &quot;finest album to date&quot;. He noted a shift from political themes toward introspection, remarking, &quot;This is an album of sweet melodies and tender words&quot;, with Mike Mills taking a larger role, as exemplified by his lead vocals on &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Out of Time&quot; was one of R.E.M.&#x27;s more successful albums in terms of awards and nominations. It was their only album to win a Grammy Award, for Best Alternative Music Album. It also won the Q Award for Best Album of 1991.

== Legacy ==

In 2000, &quot;Out of Time&quot; was voted number 49 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 list of the &quot;All-Time 100 Albums&quot;. According to the review aggregator Metacritic, the 25th anniversary re-release of &quot;Out of Time&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; based on a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 from nine critic reviews.

<doc id="619804" wikidata="Q3042998" url="?curid=619804" title="Hurlstone Park">
<text>Hurlstone Park is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Hurlstone Park is located nine kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district and is mostly in the local government area of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, and partly in the Inner West Council. The suburb is bounded by: the Cooks River to the south, Garnet Street to the east, New Canterbury Road to the north, Canterbury Road to the north-west, and Church Street to the west.

==History==
Hurlstone Park was first known as &#x27;Wattle Hill&#x27; and then &#x27;Fernhill&#x27;. After the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department refused to open a post office called Fernhill, a 1910 referendum chose the name &#x27;Hurlstone&#x27;, after the nearby Hurlstone College. John Kinloch founded the college in 1878, on the site of present-day Trinity Grammar School and named it after his mother&#x27;s maiden name, which was Helen Hurlstone. The college moved to a new site, now known as Hurlstone Agricultural High School. The &#x27;Park&#x27; was added at the request of the Railways Department, to avoid confusion with the New South Wales town of Hillston.

==Transport==

Hurlstone Park railway station was a Sydney Trains station (located 8.8 km from Central station) on the Bankstown line. The station was closed on 30 September 2024 to allow for the line to be converted to Sydney Metro standards; the Metro trains will subsequently serve the rebranded Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line.

Transit Systems operate the following bus services in Hurlstone Park: 444; 445 (to Balmain East ferry wharf via Dulwich Hill, Petersham Lilyfield, Leichhardt and Rozelle), 428 (to the city via Canterbury, Dulwich Hill, Petersham, Marrickville and Newtown) and L28 routes which run along the Canterbury Road and New Canterbury Road boundary, and the 418 (to Burwood via Ashfield, and to Bondi Junction via Dulwich Hill, Marrickville, Sydenham, St Peters, Alexandria, Mascot, Rosebery, Eastlakes, Kingsford, Randwick and Queens Park), and 406 (to Five Dock via Ashfield) routes which pass through the suburb (along Crinan Street with a bus stop directly outside the railway station).
==Commercial area==

There is a group of shops around Hurlstone Park Station: along Crinan Street, the southern end of Duntroon Street and Floss Street. There are also commercial areas along Canterbury Road and New Canterbury Road. There is an active, local Chamber of Commerce: Canterbury-Hurlstone Park Chamber of Commerce.

The rest of the commercially used land in Hurlstone Park is made up of various shops, ranging from fast food outlets and milk bars to a couple of petrol stations. Hurlstone Park also has three childcare centres. The post office opened in 1911,

==Houses==
 
Hurlstone Park has a range of period homes. It is generally a low-rise residential area with maintained family homes and larger back-yards, with tree-lined streets, and small parks and playgrounds.

<doc id="619806" wikidata="Q923010" url="?curid=619806" title="African golden oriole">
<text>The African golden oriole (Oriolus auratus), or African oriole, is a member of the oriole family of passerine birds which is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara desert.

It is a bird of thick bush and other well-wooded areas. The hanging basket-shaped nest is built in a tree, and contains two eggs. The food is insects and fruit, especially figs, found in the tree canopies where the orioles spend much of their time.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The name &quot;oriole&quot; was first recorded (in the Latin form &quot;oriolus&quot;) by Albertus Magnus in about 1250, and was stated to be onomatopoeic, from the song of the golden oriole.

The New World orioles are similar in appearance to the Oriolidae, but are icterids unrelated to the Old World birds.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognized: 
* Senegal golden oriole (&quot;O. a. auratus&quot;) - : Found from Senegal and Gambia to western Ethiopia and southern Somalia
* South African golden oriole (&quot;O. a. notatus&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from Angola to central Mozambique

==Description==
The male is striking in the typical oriole black and yellow plumage, although the plumage is predominantly yellow, with solid black only in the flight feathers and tail centre. There is a great deal of gold in the wings, which is a distinction from the Eurasian golden oriole, which winters in Africa.

The female is a drabber green bird, distinguished from the European species by more contrasting wings and black around the eye. Orioles are shy, and even the male is remarkably difficult to see in the dappled yellow and green leaves of the canopy.

The flight is somewhat like a thrush, strong and direct with some shallow dips over longer distances.

The call is a screech like a jay, but the song is a beautiful fluting &quot;fee-ooo fee-ooo&quot;, unmistakable once heard.

<doc id="619811" wikidata="Q7082419" url="?curid=619811" title="Oklahoma Wranglers">
<text>The Oklahoma Wranglers were a professional arena football team based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They were members of the Central (1996–1997) and Western (1998–2001) Division of the American Conference of the Arena Football League (AFL). They previously played as the Memphis Pharaohs and Portland Forest Dragons. The team played at the Myriad, now known as the Cox Convention Center, in downtown Oklahoma City.

==History==

===Memphis Pharaohs (1995–1996)===
The Memphis Pharaohs played at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1995 and 1996. The team was named the Pharaohs because the capital of ancient Egypt was Memphis, Egypt, and because they literally played their home games in a pyramid. Memphis saw a return of the sport with the Memphis Xplorers of af2.

===Portland Forest Dragons (1997–1999)===
After a winless 1996 season, the team relocated to Portland, Oregon, where they played for three seasons as the Portland Forest Dragons. In years of 1997, 1998, and 1999, the Forest Dragons compiled records of 2–12, 4–10, and 7–7, never making the playoffs while in Portland. During the 1998 season the team featured receiver Oronde Gadsden, who won the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award, and went on to sign with the NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins. Portland would see a return of the AFL in 2014 with the Portland Thunder, renamed the Portland Steel in 2016.

===Oklahoma Wranglers (2000–2001)===
After three seasons in Portland, the franchise relocated again, this time to Oklahoma City. The franchise moved after its owner attempted and failed to sell the team to an owner committed to keeping the team in Portland. After relocating, the team changed their name to the Oklahoma Wranglers. The team played in Oklahoma City for two seasons before being disbanded by the league after the 2001 season.

==AFL return to Oklahoma City==
The AFL&#x27;s developmental league af2 welcomed the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz to play from 2004 to 2009. In 2010, nearly a decade after the Wranglers last played, the Yard Dawgz joined the newly reorganized AFL and played only one season before folding.

<doc id="619815" wikidata="Q5142465" url="?curid=619815" title="Cold reading (theatrical)">
<text>Theatrical cold reading is reading aloud from a script or other text with little or no rehearsal, practice or study in advance. Sometimes also referred to as sight reading, it is a technique used by actors and other performers in theatre, television, and film performance fields. 

Cold readings are common in performance classes, and are employed frequently in actor auditions to allow the producer or playwright to get a general idea of the actors&#x27; performing capabilities. They are also employed by playwrights who need to hear their play read aloud for the first time by actors, and as such they form an initial integral component of the collaborative creative theatrical process, which may or may not include the eventual production of the play itself. (Public performances of cold readings also serve as entertainment in their own right, particularly in the context of community theater, and less public readings can serve as creative incubators for more established playwright and theatrical talent during the course of play development.) Many actors and other performers and public speakers take classes and practice at length to improve the quality of their cold readings.

Cold reading can also be used in conjunction with improvisations to gauge a performer&#x27;s ability to perform new works. A good dramatic cold reader is able to communicate with fluency and clarity and to project speech rhythms and rhymes well. The reader should also be able to bring out the intent, mood and characterization of a piece through appropriate articulation and body language.

<text>Joseph Davis (15 April 190110 July 1978) was an English professional snooker and English billiards player. He was the dominant figure in snooker from the 1920s to the 1950s, and has been credited with inventing aspects of the way the game is now played, such as -building. With the help of equipment manufacturer Bill Camkin, he drove the creation of the World Snooker Championship by persuading the Billiards Association and Control Council to recognise an official professional snooker championship in 1927. Davis won the first 15 world championships from 1927 to 1946, and he is the only undefeated player in World Snooker Championship history. In 1935, he scored the championship&#x27;s first .

A professional English billiards player from the age of 18, Davis was World Billiards Champion four times between 1928 and 1932. He was the first person to win world championship titles in both billiards and snooker. After his 1946 victory, Davis no longer played in the World Snooker Championship but he participated in other tournaments and exhibition matches until 1964, winning four &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament titles. He also continued to wield considerable influence over the professional game through his chairmanship of the professional players&#x27; association, his co-ownership of the Leicester Square Hall venue, and his negotiation of television contracts. His younger brother, Fred Davis, was the only person to defeat Joe Davis in a competitive snooker match without receiving a start.

In 1955, Davis was the first player to make an officially recognised maximum break. He collapsed whilst watching his brother Fred play Perrie Mans in the semi-final of the 1978 World Snooker Championship. During his convalescence, Davis contracted a chest infection which led to his death on 10 July that year.

==Early life==
Joseph Davis was born in Whitwell, Derbyshire, on 15 April 1901, the son of Elizabeth and Fred Davis. His younger brother, Fred, the youngest of the family&#x27;s six children, would also grow up to become a professional snooker player. His father was a miner when Joe was born, and had become a publican by the time Joe was two years old, managing the Travellers Rest pub at Whittington Moor. Davis was sent to live with his grandparents in Newbold for several years. By the time he moved back to live with his parents, his father was the landlord of the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, which had a full-size billiard table. Davis started playing English billiards at the age of eleven. From the age of twelve, he took lessons from Ernest Rudge, a billiards player turned entrepreneur, who lived in Chesterfield and had recently opened a billiard hall in the town. The lessons took place at Rudge&#x27;s private billiard room at the end of his garden. Davis would later manage billiard halls owned either by his family or by Rudge. He scored his first in billiards at age twelve in an exhibition game against J. D. Dickens.

Rudge arranged professional matches at his billiards hall in Chesterfield. In December 1913, he hosted a week-long match between the Australian billiards player George Gray, and Claude Falkiner from Featherstone in West Yorkshire. Davis acted as the for this match, giving him the chance to closely observe the technique of the two professional players. At one point during the week, Rudge asked Gray to give his opinion of Davis. Gray played with a that involved sighting with both eyes centrally over the cue, and with the cue running down the middle of his chin. Davis could not focus with his right eye so he played using a stance in which he rested the cue slightly to the left side of his chin, allowing him to sight along the cue with just his left eye. According to Davis, Gray said of him: &quot;the boy will never be a good player until he alters his sighting.&quot; Davis was despondent following Gray&#x27;s assessment of him. Rudge tried to change Davis&#x27;s technique and stance to make him play &quot;two-eyed&quot; but, since Davis could not play this way naturally, they decided not to persist in trying to alter this aspect of his style.

At the age of 13, Davis beat Dickens to win the Chesterfield and District Amateur Billiards Championship. The final score over three evenings was 1,500–1,229 to Davis, who received a trophy, a gold medal and a set of billiard balls for making a of 115, the highest of the tournament. In February 1915, Rudge organised a match between Tom Reece and Willie Smith at Chesterfield. Reece played a practice game against Davis on the afternoon of 11 February, because Smith had a business engagement elsewhere. Davis, who was given a start of 650 points, defeated Reece 1,000–785. At the opening of the Victoria Billiard Hall in Hasland the same year, Davis played the ex-Yorkshire champion F. W. Hughes of Leeds in an exhibition match. Davis received a handicap start of 200 points, and defeated Hughes 600–370, concluding with an unfinished break of 99. In an exhibition match at Chesterfield against Falkiner on 14 September 1916, he lost 232–400, after being given a 150-point head start.

==Professional billiards career==
===1919–1927===
Davis became a professional billiards player in 1919 at the age of 18. His first professional match was in February 1920 at Brampton Coliseum, just outside Chesterfield, against Albert Raynor of Sheffield. It was a week-long match of the first to 8,000 points. Raynor conceded 1,000 points to Davis from the start. The match finished on 14 February, and resulted in a victory for Davis by 145 points. His highest break of the match was 160. By the end of March 1920, Davis&#x27;s highest recorded break in billiards was 468. He defeated the Midlands champion, Fred Lawrence, at Chesterfield on 27 March 1920 in a week-long match of the first to 8,000 points. Having received a start of 1,000 points, Davis won by 8,000–7,494, and made 23 breaks over 100, the highest of which was 262. On 29 November 1920, he began a week-long match of the first to 8,000 points, against Arthur F. Peall at the Victoria Billiard Hall in Chesterfield. Davis received a start of 1,000 points, but lost 7,785–8,000.

In March 1921, he lost 302–400 to Lawrence in the semi-final of an invitational professional tournament at Thurston&#x27;s Hall held in aid of the St. Dunstan&#x27;s aftercare fund. He had eliminated Scottish champion Tom Aiken in his previous match. He also lost to Lawrence in the final of his first open professional championship, the 1921 Midlands Counties Billiards Championship. Lawrence won by 866 in the first-to-7,000-points contest. At Manchester in April, Davis lost 13,208–15,000 against the northern billiards champion, Tom Tothill, despite making a break of 495.

He faced the Welsh champion, Tom Carpenter, in a match to 7,000 points at Cardiff in January 1922, winning just one point. He won the 1922 Midlands Counties Billiards Championship, defeating Tom Dennis 6,417–4,433 in the week-long final in February. Later that year, a victory in the Second Division Billiards Championship, which included a win in the final over Peall in March, gave Davis an entry into the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC) Professional Championship. According to &quot;The Birmingham Daily Gazette&quot; report, he was &quot;outclassed&quot; by Tom Newman in their championship match, which concluded on 15 April 1922, losing 5,181–8,000.

Davis failed to qualify for the 1923 professional championship, losing to Lawrence in the Second Division semi-final at Chesterfield in February. On 11 October 1923, he made the highest break of his career to that point, 599, against Lawrence at the Burroughes Hall in Piccadilly. The final score was 14,000–10,743 to Davis. He became Midlands champion for the second time in 1924, defeating Lawrence 14,000–12,263 in the final. On 28 February 1924, he made a break of 980 in the Second Division Championship at Cardiff, during a 14,000–10,240 semi-final victory over Carpenter. Davis won the championship that year, easily overcoming Lawrence in the final; his winning margin was 6,198 points with the final score 14,000–7,802. Lawrence was out of condition during this game, following a serious illness from some time before, and the result was never in doubt from the early stages.

In 1926, Davis and defending champion Newman were the only two players to enter the professional billiards championship, which is now regarded as the world championship. Newman defeated Davis 16,000–9,505. He reached the final the next year and was again defeated by Newman. In a match of the first to 16,000 points, Newman&#x27;s winning margin was 1,237. Davis achieved his highest break ever in billiards of 2,501 on 27 April 1927 in this final. He used the , which had recently been introduced by Reece, during this break. The technique involves scoring long runs of close direct by tapping the cue ball lightly across them. There were calls for this stroke to be limited or abolished because it was so tedious to watch.
On 9 August 1927, the Billiards Association Control Council decided to alter the rules to eliminate the big breaks made from ball-to-ball cannons alone. The number of consecutive direct cannons allowed during a break was limited to 35, and the pendulum stroke was defined as being in the category of the direct cannon.

Davis made a break of 1,011 on 20 October 1927 in a match against Newman at Thurston&#x27;s. It was the first 1,000 break made under the new rules. Davis won by 485 points in this match of the first to 16,000, after being given a 2,000 start.

===1928–1934===
He defeated Newman in 1928 to become the world champion at English billiards for the first time, making sixty centuries in the last final to be played with ivory balls. It took place at Thurston&#x27;s and the final score was 16,000–14,874. Davis thereby became the first player to hold the professional titles in both billiards and snooker, an achievement not matched until his brother Fred Davis won the billiards championship in 1980. Davis successfully defended his title for the next three years. In the 1929 final against Newman, Davis made 63 century breaks and his average score per to the table was 100. The final ended on 20 April 1929, with the score 18,000–17,219 to Davis.

In 1930, he set a new record average score-per-visit of 113.3. Davis again won against Newman, 20,918–20,117, in the 1930 billiards final. On 7 May 1930 in this final Davis completed a break of 2,052. At that time this was a record for the championship under the existing rules, and the highest billiard break he ever made after the rule change in 1927. The event was not held in 1931 as most of the leading professionals did not enter, mainly due to a disagreement with the BA&amp;CC over the to be used. The only entrant was Smith, who was not declared champion.

Davis played Walter Lindrum in a fortnight&#x27;s match under time limit conditions at Thurston&#x27;s, which began on 18 January 1932. Davis was given a start of 7,000. The second afternoon session ended with Lindrum on an unfinished break of 3,151 points. The next day, Lindrum narrowly missed a difficult cushion cannon with the and the break ended at 4,137. This surpassed Lindrum&#x27;s previous record of 3,905. Davis responded finishing the afternoon session on 1,131 unfinished. His break continued in the evening session and finished on 1,247. He considered this break, in many respects, to have been his finest. This was the first time that opponents in a billiards game had made four-figure breaks in consecutive visits to the table. In 1932, Davis faced New Zealander Clark McConachy in the final. McConachy had won three of their four warm-up matches but in the championship itself, Davis won 25,161–19,259, scoring over 11,000 of his points through a series of runs of &quot;close cannons&quot;, in which the three balls are kept close together for consecutive cannons. Davis reached the final again in 1933 and 1934, losing on both occasions to Lindrum.

The UK Professional English Billiards Championship was first contested in 1934, and for several years after that was regarded as the premier event of the billiards season in the UK, in the absence of any contests for the world championships. Davis won the inaugural UK title with an 18,745–18,309 defeat of Newman. After Lindrum had won the World Championship in 1933, he had insisted that the competition should be held in Australia for his defence. The Billiards Association and Control Council agreed to this, and Davis travelled to Australia for the 1934 Championship, where he was disappointed by the lack of planning for the tournament, and found it hard to raise the money for his return to the UK. Lindrum retained the world championship in 1934, and it was not contested again until 1952. Davis defeated Newman in each annual UK championship final up to 1939. The tournament was not held from 1940 to 1945, during World War II. Davis also took the first post-war UK title, with a walkover over John Barrie.

==Professional snooker career==
Coinciding with Davis&#x27;s peak as a billiards player, public interest in billiards was waning because the top players were becoming so proficient that the game was considered boring for spectators. By 1924, breaks of over 1,000 were becoming increasingly common, and amendments to the rules were under consideration to make high breaks more difficult. In February 1925, Davis played Newman in a game of snooker, and made a break of 96, which was a new record for a professional match, exceeding the existing record of 89 set by Newman in 1919. As a billiard hall manager, Davis noticed the increasing popularity of snooker and with the help of Birmingham-based billiards equipment manager Bill Camkin, he persuaded the BA&amp;CC to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The final of the first snooker world championship was held at Camkin&#x27;s Hall in 1927; Davis won the tournament by defeating Dennis 16–7, and took the winner&#x27;s prize of £6 10s.

Davis won the World Championship every year until 1940, and again in 1946 when it was next held after being interrupted by the war. He compiled his first snooker century break against Fred Pugh in January 1928, and made the first official century break of the World Snooker Championship, in 1930. As defending champion in 1928, Davis was seeded into the final to face the winner of a knockout competition between the other entrants. Lawrence qualified for the final, which Davis won 16–13. In 1929, the final was held in the back room of a pub owned by the losing finalist, Dennis, who then became runner-up for the third time in four years when Davis defeated him 25–12 in the 1930 final. In both 1931 and 1934, the tournament was contested by only Davis and one other player. The losing finalist in 1932 was McConachy, the first player from outside the British Isles to enter the World Snooker Championship, and Smith was the runner-up to Davis in 1933.

In 1934, Davis travelled to Australia to play Horace Lindrum in an invitational match, the World Snooker Challenge. Davis won by 46 frames to 29. From 1935, the World Championship became more remunerative for players, after public interest increased when Davis set a new championship record break of 110 against Newman in their semi-final. Smith was the runner-up that year. Davis won against Lindrum in the 1936 and 1937 finals. Lindrum declined to enter the 1938 tournament, and it was Sidney Smith who finished second to Davis in both that year and 1939. The 1940 final was contested between the Davis brothers; Joe took an early lead but Fred won 11 frames in a row to take a 20–14 lead. Joe eventually won the match 37–35, with Fred winning the to take the score to 37–36.

Due to World War II, the World Championship was not held again until 1946. During the war, Davis toured the United Kingdom playing exhibition matches to raise money for charities. At some exhibitions, including those at the London Palladium, a large angled mirror was positioned next to the table to allow the audience a clear view of the . Davis successfully defended his title in 1946, his 15th consecutive win, and thereby held the title for 20 consecutive years. As of 2022, he has won more world championships than any other player. Davis retired from the event following this victory, having won the title at all 15 events from 1927 to 1946, making him, as of 2022, the only undefeated player in the history of the World Championship. Davis remained the best player until his retirement in 1964; his brother Fred came closest to Joe&#x27;s standard during this time. According to snooker historian Clive Everton, Davis&#x27;s retirement from the World Championship reduced its prestige. Snooker journalists and authors Hector Nunns and David Hendon share this opinion.

With the exception of the World Championship, snooker tournaments were contested on a handicap basis where, using pre-determined numerical handicaps, one player would concede a set number of points to his opponent at the beginning of each frame, for example allowing his opponent to start with 14 points rather than zero. Despite offering a handicap to the other players, Davis won the &quot;News of the World&quot; Tournament on three occasions during the 1950s; his brother Fred and future world champion John Pulman each won it twice. In 1959, Davis attempted to popularise a new version of the game called snooker plus, which had two extra , an orange and a purple. The 1959 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Plus Tournament was contested using this variant. According to Everton, &quot;the public rejected the game for the gimmick it was.&quot;

Davis scored the first officially recognised maximum break of 147 on 22 January 1955 at Leicester Square Hall in an exhibition match against Smith. The BA&amp;CC initially refused to recognise the break because it was not made under their version of the rules; the match had taken place under the rules used by professionals that included the &quot;play again&quot; rule under which the opponent can require a player who has made a shot to play the next shot as well. The Association eventually recognised the break in April 1957, shortly before the &quot;play again&quot; rule was incorporated into the rules for amateur players.

Davis was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963. He continued to play professionally until 1964. Davis died on 10 July 1978, two months after falling ill while watching his brother Fred play Perrie Mans in the 1978 World Snooker Championship semi-final. The day after the match, he collapsed in the street and required a lengthy surgical procedure. He died from a chest infection that he contracted during his recuperation. The house in Whitwell where he was born bears a plaque commemorating him.

==Legacy==
Over a 20-year period, Davis won four World Billiards Championship titles and 15 World Snooker Championship titles. Other than in handicapped matches in which he conceded a start, he lost only four times, all towards the end of his career and against his brother Fred. Everton has said of Davis&#x27;s influence on the game in the early 1920s: &quot;in those days, the prevailing idea was to pot a red or two, a couple of colours and play safe but in the time he could spare from billiards Davis devoted considerable thought and practice to evolving the positional and breakbuilding shots, sequences and techniques which are taken for granted today.&quot; Fred Davis, the second person to become a world champion at both snooker and billiards, said that his brother Joe was &quot;a very good player before anyone else knew how to play the game.&quot; Ted Lowe, manager of Leicester Square Hall and later a snooker commentator for the BBC, wrote that &quot;because of his magnetism, snooker was able to replace billiards in most clubs, pubs and billiard halls.&quot; Journalist Donald Trelford provided a similar assessment in his book &quot;Snookered&quot; (1986), writing that Davis had the vision to identify snooker as a replacement for billiards and &quot;had the organizing genius and force of habit to make things happen in that moribund world.&quot;

Davis was not able to focus with his right eye; he played with his cue to the left of his chin. Coach Frank Callan, in his book &quot;Frank Callan&#x27;s Snooker Clinic&quot; (1989), compared the most successful player at the time, Steve Davis, to Joe Davis and concluded that Joe was the better player. While learning to play snooker, Steve Davis was heavily influenced by Joe Davis&#x27;s book &quot;How I Play Snooker&quot; (1956). Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan said of one of Davis&#x27;s coaching books: &quot; ... was one of my best years and it was all because I was reading the Joe Davis book.&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan again paid tribute to Davis after claiming his sixth world title in 2020. Everton wrote that, following his retirement from the world championship, Davis &quot;through his force of personality ... controlled the game&quot;, being the pre-eminent player, chairman of the professional players&#x27; association, a co-owner of the Leicester Square Hall (the main venue for professional matches), and the negotiator for television contracts. Davis was nicknamed &quot;Mr Snooker&quot;, &quot;the Sultan of Snooker&quot; and &quot;the Emperor of Pot&quot;.

==Personal life==
Davis married Florence Enid Stevenson (born 1898 or 1899) on 8 June 1921, and they had two children together. This first marriage was dissolved in 1931. On 6 April 1945, he married Juanita Ida Triggs (born 1914 or 1915), a singer who performed under the stage name June Malo.

<text>The London Swinton Circle (otherwise known as the Swinton Circle) is a long-running British right-wing pressure group. The group states that its purpose is to uphold traditional conservative and Unionist principles.

The group formed part of a number of Conservative Party-linked fringe groups which came to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Monday Club, Tory Action and WISE (Welsh, Irish, Scottish, English), but is now positioned outside of the Conservative Party.

==History ==

===Origins===
A few city-based discussion groups with the suffix &quot;Swinton Circle&quot; were formed for those Conservative Party activists who had attended Conservative Party training at Swinton College. The London Swinton Circle was founded in 1965, early members included Rhodes Boyson and T. E. Utley. Another prominent early member was Roger Moate MP. The London Swinton Circle was the only one of the groups to continue beyond the 1970s.

===Bee Carthew===
The London Swinton Circle came to be run during the eighties by Mrs Beryl &#x27;Bee&#x27; Carthew who was described by the satirical &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine as a &quot;well-known right-wing looney&quot;. Carthew had previously formed and ran the &quot;Powellight Association&quot; which published a magazine, &quot;Powellight&quot;, in support of Enoch Powell during the late 1960s and early 1970s. An executive member of the Monday Club with George Kennedy Young, she was expelled from the Club in 1974 as part of a purge made by Jonathan Guinness. She briefly joined the National Front in 1975, before later rejoining the Conservative Party. She briefly ran the London Office for the nascent UK Independence Party (UKIP).

===From the early 1980s===
In the early 1980s, the group held several meetings of &quot;right-wing Tories and neo-fascists&quot; with the aim of &quot;co-ordinating anti-immigration campaigns&quot;. By this time, the Conservative Party was concerned that &quot;co-ordinating groups&quot; like the Swinton Circle were being infiltrated by the far right. Its most commented-upon meeting was in 1983 with Ivor Benson as guest speaker. Revelations about the extreme-right past of one member led to a motion in Parliament.

Adrian Davies was for a time secretary of the Circle after Bee Carthew.

===Allan Robertson===

From 1992 to 2020 the Circle was run by Allan Robertson, a former member of the Scottish Monday Club and contributing editor of &quot;Right Now!&quot; magazine. Robertson produced a newsletter &quot;Tough Talking From The Right&quot; magazine. Robertson died unexpectedly in February 2020.

===21st Century===

Conservative MPs, including Liam Fox and Owen Paterson, were criticised in 2014 for speaking to the group whose publications have expressed views such as the mass deportation of British people of African descent to Africa. The Circle had also suggested that &quot;an earthquake in New Zealand might have been a warning against gay marriage&quot;.

Sheila Gilmore MP described the Circle as holding &quot;vile views&quot; and has questioned why the Conservative Party continues to be associated with the group.

==Policies==
The Circle is strongly Unionist and supports the restoration of capital punishment, and is against immigration and same-sex marriage. It backed Brexit, though the Swinton Circle continues to endorse the Conservative Party.

<doc id="619823" wikidata="Q507014" url="?curid=619823" title="Paul Virilio">
<text>Paul Virilio (; 4 January 1932 – 10 September 2018) was a French cultural theorist, urbanist, architect and aesthetic philosopher. He is best known for his writings about technology as it has developed in relation to speed and power, with diverse references to architecture, the arts, the city and the military. Virilio was a prolific creator of neologisms, most notably his concept of &quot;dromology&quot;, the all-around, pervasive inscription of speed in every aspect of life.

According to two biographers, Virilio was a &quot;historian of warfare, technology and photography, a philosopher of architecture, military strategy and cinema, and a politically engaged provocative commentator on history, terrorism, mass media and human-machine relations.&quot;

==Biography==
Paul Virilio was born in Paris in 1932 to an Italian communist father and a Catholic Breton mother.

After being conscripted into the army during the Algerian War, Virilio attended lectures in phenomenology by Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the Sorbonne.

In 1998, Virilio began to teach intensive seminars at the European Graduate School. His final projects involved working with homeless groups in Paris and building the first Museum of the Accident.

==Ideas==
Virilio coined the term &quot;dromology&quot; (based on &quot;&quot;, an Ancient Greek noun for race or racetrack) to signify the &quot;logic and impact of speed&quot;. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media, as the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower. Hence the study of dromology &quot;necessarily implies the study of the organisation of territory, [as whoever] controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation&quot;.

===Reception===
Jean Baudrillard, while drawing on Virilio&#x27;s works in 1985, eventually stated in 1988 that Virilio&#x27;s analyses were out of date as &quot;Speed is out!&quot;, stating that immobility has set in because &quot;all trips have already taken place&quot;.

A book-length criticism of Virilio&#x27;s work to 2004 was written by Steve Redhead. He observed:
:His scattergun writing style is not always easy to follow, often provoking disorientation and dislocation at the very least. Insights, personal memories, detailed histories, major theoretical leaps and banalities sit side by side.
He also notes that Virilio does not pass the grade in academic studies:
:Reading Virilio thoroughly does leave the reader with the feeling of many dislocated, undeveloped ideas swirling around often at the level of great generality. The content is often not particularly logical if viewed from a conventional academic perspective in the human or social sciences.
However, for Law and Popular Culture, Redhead concedes Virilio as a factor:
:Paul Virilio&#x27;s writing have long had a major role in the theoretical socio-legal studies subdiscipline of law and popular culture which has operated at the intersection of critical legal studies and cultural studies for over two decades.

In 2014, Mark Lacy, an analyst of security, technology and global politics noted:
:Virilio is unlikely to be read in the &#x27;mainstream&#x27; of academia (although one might find his works on the reading lists of a military academy).
Lacy credits Virilio with balancing the propaganda of progress against the management of fear at some cost:
:Virilio draws on and develops points that are made by many critical thinkers from (predominantly) the twentieth century (most notably Walter Benjamin), assembling ideas in new contexts, creating a vision of the world through concepts and language that is often unsettling, a (re)description that makes the world feel strange and unfamiliar. Virilio&#x27;s often alien-sounding concepts attempt to enable us to see the world anew, to view a world that is presented to us in terms of fear and progress as something alien (and alienating), to give a form to feelings and suspicions that remain vague, unclear, uncertain, out of place.

====Sokal and Bricmont====
Virilio was one of the many cultural theorists (and other postmodernists) criticized by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in 1997 for what they characterize as misunderstanding and misuse of science and mathematics. Virilio&#x27;s works are the subject of chapter 10 of &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;. Their criticism consists of a series of quotes (often long) from Virilio&#x27;s works, and then explanations of how Virilio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology, to the point of absurdity. In the authors&#x27; words:

:The writings of Paul Virilio revolve principally around the themes of technology, communication, and speed. They contain a plethora of references to physics, particularly the theory of relativity. Though Virilio&#x27;s sentences are slightly more meaningful than those of Deleuze-Guattari, what is presented as &quot;science&quot; is a mixture of monumental confusions and wild fantasies. Furthermore, his analogies between physics and social questions are the most arbitrary imaginable, when he does not simply become intoxicated with his own words. We confess our sympathy with many of Virilio&#x27;s political and social views; but the cause is not, alas, helped by his pseudo-physics.

A criticism of a passage often reads something like this:
:Here Virilio mixes up velocity (vitesse) and acceleration, the two basic concepts of kinematics (the description of motion), which are introduced and carefully distinguished at the beginning of every introductory physics course.[221] Perhaps this confusion isn&#x27;t worth stressing; but for a purported specialist in the philosophy of speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising.

They end their chapter with a long quote followed by this comment:
:This paragraph — which in the French original is a single 193-word sentence, whose &quot;poetry&quot; is unfortunately not fully captured by the translation — is the most perfect example of diarrhea of the pen that we have ever encountered. And as far as we can see, it means precisely nothing.

<doc id="619824" wikidata="Q2525229" url="?curid=619824" title="Violin Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Violin Concerto No. 2 in C-sharp minor, Op. 129, was Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s last concerto. He wrote it in the spring of 1967 and intended it to serve as a 60th birthday present for its dedicatee, David Oistrakh, in September. However, Shostakovich had mistaken Oistrakh&#x27;s age; he actually turned 59 that year. It was premiered unofficially in Bolshevo, near Moscow, on 13 September 1967, and officially on 26 September by Oistrakh and the Moscow Philharmonic under Kirill Kondrashin in Moscow.

==Scoring and structure==
The concerto is scored for solo violin, piccolo, flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, timpani, tom-tom drum and strings.

A performance of the piece lasts approximately 33 minutes. It has three movements:
==Analysis==
The key of C-sharp minor is a difficult one for the violin.

The first movement is in sonata form and concludes with a contrapuntal cadenza. The Adagio is in three parts, with a central accompanied cadenza. The final movement is a complex rondo. It has a slow introduction, three episodes between the refrains, and a further long cadenza before the third episode reprising material from earlier in the work.

<doc id="619831" wikidata="Q49627" url="?curid=619831" title="List of lochs of Scotland">
<text>This list of lochs in [[Scotland]] includes the majority of bodies of standing freshwater named as lochs but only a small selection of the generally smaller, and very numerous, lochans. This list does not currently include the reservoirs of Scotland except where these are modifications of pre-existing lochs and retain the name &quot;loch&quot; or &quot;lochan&quot;.

It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs (including lochans) in Scotland, and more than 7,500 in the Western Isles alone. Whilst lochs are widespread throughout the country, they are most numerous within the Scottish Highlands and in particular in the former counties of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross and Cromarty. The majority of the larger lochs are linear in form; their distribution through the West Highlands reflects their origin in the glacial overdeepening of the straths and glens they now occupy.

&quot;Loch&quot; is a Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or fjord (cognate with the Irish Gaelic &quot;loch&quot;, which is anglicised as &quot;lough&quot; and with the older Welsh word for a lake, &quot;llwch&quot;) that has been borrowed by Scots and Scottish English to apply to such bodies of water, especially those in Scotland. Whilst &quot;loch&quot; or &quot;lochan&quot; is by far the most widespread name for bodies of standing water in Scotland, a number of other terms exist. The Lake of Menteith is the only natural body of freshwater called a &quot;lake&quot; in Scotland, (although it is also known as &quot;Loch Innis Mo Cholmaig&quot; in Gaelic) and there are one or two other man-made &quot;lakes&quot;, the Lake of the Hirsel being an example. Numerous lochs are called &quot;water&quot;, particularly in the Northern Isles, e.g. Roer Water in Shetland and Heldale Water in Orkney. These are not to be confused with similarly named rivers, particularly in the south of Scotland, e.g. Yarrow Water and Blackadder Water.
== Largest and deepest lochs ==

This table includes the twelve largest lochs by volume, area and length as listed by Murray and Pullar (1910). The volume of water in Loch Ness is nearly double that in all the lakes of England and Wales combined. Murray and Pullar also note that the mean depth of Loch Ness is 57.4% of the maximum depth – higher than in any other large deep loch, with Loch Avich coming closest at 52.4%.
Lochs Maree, Shiel and Ness are recorded as being the narrowest of the large lochs in relation to their length.

Neither the Loch of Stenness nor the Loch of Harray on Mainland Orkney is large enough to appear in the above table (Loch of Harray is 16th by area) but at higher stages of the tide they are connected to one another and to the marine waters of Hoy Sound. The former is the largest brackish lagoon in the UK and the latter, whilst predominantly freshwater, does have a transition zone in the vicinity of the Bridge of Brodgar where the two are connected. The two lochs together cover an area of but have a volume of only as they are so shallow; Loch of Stenness has a maximum depth of . Although flow between the two lochs and the sea can be observed, the water levels only change slightly with the movements of the tide.

==Mainland==
In reaching an alphabetically arranged list, the words &quot;loch&quot; and &quot;lochan&quot; have been ignored, as have articles and prepositions in both Gaelic (a&#x27;, an, an t-, na, na h-, nam, nan etc.) and English (of, the etc.). Those that have been converted to reservoirs for water supply or in association with hydroelectric projects and whose levels have been artificially raised by the construction of dams or barrages are annotated as reservoir.

==Lochs on islands==
There are a very large number of lochs on the islands of Scotland, with the greatest density occurring in the Outer Hebrides. North and South Uist and Lewis in particular have landscapes with a high percentage of freshwater and a maze and complexity of loch shapes. Harris has fewer large bodies of water but innumerable small lochans.

===Larger===
Those listed in this section are confined to the larger or otherwise notable lochs.

Loch Orasaigh in Lewis is only about in extent but the island of Rainish Eilean Mòr is probably the largest island in Scotland relative to the size of the body of water it sits in, as it takes up about 20% of the loch&#x27;s surface area.

The meanings of the names are generally derived from Gaelic, Old Norse or Scots.

===Smaller===
Less substantial lochs include the following.
* Lismore: Loch Fiart, Kilcheran Loch, Loch Baile a&#x27; Ghobhainn
* Orkney: see List of lochs in Orkney
* Shetland:
**Mainland Shetland: Clickimin Loch
**Whalsay: Loch of Houll, Loch of Huxter, Loch of Isbister, Loch of Livister, Loch of Sandwick, Loch of Stanefield, Loch of Vats-houll, Nuckro Water, East Loch of Skaw, West Loch of Skaw

<text>Keith Harvey Proctor (born 16 January 1947) is a British former Conservative Member of Parliament. A member of the Monday Club, he represented Basildon from 1979 to 1983 and Billericay from 1983 to 1987. Proctor became embroiled in a scandal involving sexual relationships with males under 21 which culminated in criminal convictions and ended his parliamentary career. 

He was later one of those accused by Carl Beech of being part of an abuse ring, something which Harvey strongly denied. In 2016, the investigations into Proctor concluded and found the accusations to be baseless. Proctor was subsequently paid £900,000 in compensation for victimisation through the botched Operation Midland. His experience has seen him lead efforts to protect those in the public eye from unfair attacks by the media.

== Early life and career ==

Harvey Proctor was born in Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire, going to the Scarborough High School for Boys and then the University of York where he read history. He had joined the Young Conservatives at the age of 14 in 1961, and was chairman of York University Conservative Association from 1967 to 1969. In the summer of 1967, while chairman-elect of the association, he was invited to produce a number of half-hour political programmes for broadcast on offshore Radio 270, which included interviews with MPs John Biggs-Davison and Patrick Wall.

Proctor became an active member of the Monday Club. He was the club&#x27;s assistant director from 1969 to 1971, and a member of its executive council from 1983 until he stood down as an MP in 1987.

In 1972, Proctor, then working as a researcher for anti-Common Market Conservative MPs who tried to stop Britain entering the European Communities (EC), had been adopted as candidate for Hackney South and Shoreditch. He fought the seat at both the February and October general elections of 1974.

== In parliament ==

Proctor won the selection for Basildon in 1978. The seat was not expected to be easy for the Conservatives to win, but Proctor was elected in the 1979 election after a campaign in which he argued in favour of restricting the number of &quot;coloured&quot; immigrants. He returned to this theme, also advocating payment for repatriation, during his first term in Parliament.

Originally as secretary of the Monday Club&#x27;s Northern Ireland Policy Committee, he backed calls from MPs of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to implement her 1979 Conservative manifesto commitment to &quot;establish one or more elected regional councils in Northern Ireland with a wide range of powers over local services&quot; in place of the 1982–86 Northern Ireland Assembly, and also opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement. This earned him the admiration and support of the UUP leader James Molyneaux (later Lord Molyneaux) and the UUP chief whip, Willie Ross.

Proctor opposed, on libertarian grounds, the call to boycott the Moscow Olympics of 1980. He also opposed establishing the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982, voted for the return of capital punishment, and rebelled on votes over the EC. In the 1983 election Proctor&#x27;s seat was divided, and he moved with the more Conservative-voting part to the new Billericay seat.

He was chairman of the Monday Club&#x27;s Immigration and Repatriation Committee (later renamed, under him, the Immigration and Race Relations Committee). He made a bid for election as the club&#x27;s chairman in April 1982, but was defeated.

== Resignation and trial ==
In June 1986, &quot;The People&quot; newspaper published claims that Proctor had taken part in sexual relationships with male prostitutes aged between 17 and 21, in his London flat in exchange for money, and took indecent photos of them with a Polaroid camera. The age of consent for same-sex relationships was still 21 in 1986 (although 16 for opposite sex relationships), no specific legislation existed at the time regarding minimum ages for prostitution and the following year Proctor was charged with gross indecency and resigned his candidature. He was succeeded as MP by Teresa Gorman at the general election. At his trial in May 1987, Proctor pleaded guilty to four acts of gross indecency with a 17-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man and was fined a total of £1,450.

==Shirtmaker==
Following his resignation, Proctor opened an eponymous shirtmakers, Proctor&#x27;s, in Richmond, Greater London. The shop was launched with a £75,000 fund organised by Tristan Garel-Jones MP. A second shop was later opened in Knightsbridge. Several Conservative politicians invested in the shop, including Michael Heseltine and Jeffrey Archer, and by 1994 eleven Conservative MPs were shareholders in its parent company, Cottonrose Ltd. Proctor&#x27;s shirts were also worn by the Prime Minister, John Major.

In 1992, Proctor was a victim of a homophobic attack in his shop. Neil Hamilton MP was present at the time, and defended Proctor. Hamilton suffered a broken nose in the incident. Two men were later imprisoned for the assault.

By 1994, the shops were £150,000 in debt. Proctor said that &quot;It has been quite a struggle to survive. It has not been helped by press comment every six months that we are closing down&quot;. The shops went into liquidation in 2000.

In 2003, Proctor became the private secretary to David Manners, 11th Duke of Rutland, at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire.

==Operation Midland investigation==
On 4 March 2015, Proctor&#x27;s home, on the Belvoir estate, was searched by the Metropolitan Police as part of the Operation Midland investigation into allegations of historical child sexual abuse and related homicides. Proctor denied any wrongdoing in an interview with the &quot;Today&quot; programme. He retired from his job with the Duke and Duchess of Rutland on 25 March 2015, &quot;with immediate effect&quot;.

Proctor was questioned by the police regarding the allegations in June, and again in August 2015. He held a press conference at St Ermin&#x27;s Hotel, London on 25 August 2015, and gave several media interviews. He described the inquiry as a &quot;homosexual witch hunt&quot;, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m a homosexual. I&#x27;m not a murderer or a paedophile. I&#x27;m completely innocent of all these allegations.&quot;

On 21 March 2016, Proctor was told that he would face no further action. He was the last living person under investigation by Operation Midland, and called for an independent inquiry into it, for the resignations of senior officers involved, and for his accuser to be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice. Proctor wrote an open letter to all MPs published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 21 March 2016. The Metropolitan Police closed Operation Midland with no charges brought and no files passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. Proctor held a further press conference on 29 March 2016 and was interviewed on many news outlets including BBC, ITV, Sky News and &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; and BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; programmes.

Following the publication of Sir Richard Henriques&#x27; Report on Operation Midland and other police investigations on 8 November 2016, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, apologised to Proctor and others for the over 40 mistakes made by the Metropolitan Police service in Operation Midland. He said Proctor was innocent of all the allegations. On 15 November 2016 Hogan-Howe met Proctor at Hogan-Howe&#x27;s request in Dean&#x27;s Yard, London and repeated his apology for the MPS&#x27;s mistakes. Proctor sued the Metropolitan Police in February 2017.

On 10 October 2017, Proctor criticised Mike Veale, the Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, for allegedly &quot;trashing&quot; his reputation a second time by reviving claims of an establishment paedophile ring. Veale had called for a fresh inquiry into claims of cover-up and conspiracy in Westminster.

In June 2019, Proctor appeared at Newcastle Crown Court where he gave evidence at the trial of Carl Beech, who was accused of lying to police about the alleged VIP paedophile ring investigated by Operation Midland. Proctor said: &quot;The allegations are wrong, malicious, false, horrendous&quot; and later explained that intense media interest, following the police raid, had led to him losing his job and then him deciding to move to Spain as the UK &quot;wasn&#x27;t safe&quot;. At that trial, Beech was convicted for making false claims against Proctor and other victims, and sentenced to 18 years&#x27; imprisonment.

In September 2019, Proctor criticised the Independent Office for Police Conduct for clearing the Met officers who investigated allegations made by Beech. Proctor said that &quot;to fail to condemn this police misbehaviour in the strongest terms and at the first opportunity, is a dereliction of duty&quot;.

In November 2019, it was reported that Proctor received a £900,000 payout in compensation and legal fees from the Metropolitan Police as a result of the police force&#x27;s handling of the failed Operation Midland.

<doc id="619846" wikidata="Q674543" url="?curid=619846" title="Glanum">
<text>Glanum (Hellenistic &quot;Γλανόν&quot;, as well as Glano, Calum, Clano, Clanum, Glanu, Glano) was an ancient and wealthy city which still enjoys a magnificent setting below a gorge on the flanks of the Alpilles mountains. It is located about one kilometre south of the town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.
Originally a Celto-Ligurian &quot;oppidum&quot;, it expanded under Greek influence before becoming a Roman city. As it was never built over by settlements after the Roman period but was partly buried by deposits washed from the hills above, much of it was preserved. Many of the impressive buildings have been excavated and can be visited today.

It is particularly known for two well-preserved Roman monuments of the 1st century BC, known as &quot;Les Antiques&quot;, a mausoleum and a triumphal arch.

==History==

===The Celto-Ligurian oppidum===

Between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, the Salyens, the largest of the Celto-Ligurian tribes in Provence, built a rampart of stones on the peaks that surrounded the valley of Notre-Dame-de-Laval, and constructed an &quot;oppidum&quot;, or fortified town, around the spring in the valley, which was known for its healing powers. A shrine was built at the spring to Glanis, a Celtic god. The town grew, and a second wall was built in the 2nd century BC.

The town had a strong Celtic identity, shown by the names of the residents (Vrittakos, Eporix, Litumaros); by the names of the local gods (Glanis and his companions, the Glanicae, (similar to the Roman Matres); and the goddesses Rosmerta and Epona); by the statues and pottery; by the customs, such as displaying the severed heads of enemies at the city gate; and by the cooking utensils found in the ruins, which showed that the people of Glanis boiled their food in pots, rather than frying it in pans like other Mediterranean tribes.

The people of Glanum were in early contact with the Greek colony of Massalia, present day Marseille, which had been founded in about 600 BC. The contact influenced the architecture and art of Glanum – villas were built in the Hellenic style. But by the 2nd century BC conflicts and wars arose between the Salyens and the Greeks of Marseille, who not having a powerful army, called upon the assistance of their Roman allies. In 125 BC the Salyens were defeated by the army of the Roman consul Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, and the following year decisively defeated by C. Sextus Calvinus. Many of the old monuments of Glanum were destroyed.

Due to its commercially useful location on the Via Domitia, and the attraction of its healing spring, the town prospered again. The city produced its own silver coins and built new monuments. The prosperity lasted until 90 BC when the Salyens again rebelled against Rome. The public buildings of Glanum were again destroyed. The rebellion was crushed this time by the Consul Caecilius, and the remains of the main buildings demolished and replaced by more modest structures.

===The Roman town===

In 49 BC, Julius Caesar captured Marseille and, after a period of destructive civil wars, the romanisation of Provence and Glanum began.

The Glanum Dam, a curved stone arch dam, and the oldest known of its kind, and an aqueduct were built in the 1st century BC, to supply water for the town&#x27;s fountains and public baths.

In 27 BC, the Emperor Augustus created the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis, and in this province Glanum was given the title of &quot;oppidum latinum&quot;, which gave residents the civil and political status of citizens of Rome. A triumphal arch was built outside the town in about 10 BC (the first such arch to be built in Gaul), as well as an impressive mausoleum of the Julii family, both still standing.

In the 1st century AD the city built a new forum and temples.

Glanum was not as prosperous as the Roman colonies of Arelate, Avennio, and Cabellio, but by the 2nd century AD it was wealthy enough to build impressive shrines to the Emperors, to enlarge the forum, and to have extensive thermae and other public buildings clad in marble.

===Destruction, rediscovery and excavation===

The town was overrun and destroyed by the Alamanni in 260 AD and subsequently abandoned, its inhabitants moving a short distance north into the plain to found a city that eventually became modern day Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Eventually Glanum became a source of stone and other building materials for Saint-Remy. Since the Roman system of drains and sewers was not maintained, the ruins became flooded and covered with mud and sediment. The mausoleum and triumphal arch, together known as &quot;Les Antiques&quot;, were famous and were visited by King Charles IX, who had the surroundings cleaned up and maintained. Some excavations were made around the monuments as early as the 16th and 17th centuries, finding sculptures and coins, and by the Marquis de Lagoy in the Vallons-de-Notre-Dame in the 19th century.

The first systematic excavations began in 1921, directed by the architect of historic monuments Jules Formigé. From 1921 until 1941, the archaeologist Pierre de Brun worked on the site, discovering the baths, the basilica, and the residences of the northern part of the town. From 1928 to 1933, Henri Rolland (1887–1970) worked on the Iron Age sanctuary, to the south. From 1942 until 1969, Rolland took over the work and excavated the area from the forum to the sanctuary. The objects he discovered are on display today at the Hôtel de Sade in nearby Saint-Rémy. New excavation and exploration work began in 1982, devoted mainly to the preservation of the site, and to exploring beneath sites already discovered for older works.

==Monuments of Glanum==

===Mausoleum of the Julii===

The Mausoleum of the Julii, located across the Via Domitia, to the north of, and just outside the city entrance, dates to about 40 BC, and is one of the best preserved mausoleums of the Roman era.

A dedication is carved on the architrave of the building facing the old Roman road, which reads:

It is believed that the mausoleum was the tomb of the mother and father of the three Julii brothers, and that the father, for military or civil service, received Roman citizenship and the privilege of bearing the name of the Julii, one of the most distinguished families in Rome.

The mausoleum is built in three stages. The upper stage, or tholos, is a circular chapel with Corinthian columns. It contains two statues wearing togas, presumably the father and grandfather of the Julii. (The heads of the statues were lost at an earlier date, and replaced in the 18th century). The conical roof is decorated with carved fish scales, traditional for Roman mausoleums. The frieze beneath the conical roof is decorated with a rinceau featuring carvings of acanthus leaves, used in Roman mortuary architecture to represent eternal rebirth.

The middle stage, or quadrifons, is an arch with four bays. The archivoltes, or curved bands of decoration on the tops of the arches, also have acanthus leaves. At the top of each arch is the carved head of a gorgon, the traditional protector of Roman tombs.

The frieze at the top of the quadrifons is decorated with carvings of tritons, carrying the disk of the sun, and with sea monsters.
The lowest part of the mausoleum is decorated with carved garlands of vegetation, theater masks and cupids or putti, and with mythical or legendary scenes. 
*North face – a battle of horsemen, and a winged victory carries a trophy.
*East face – an infantryman unhorses an Amazon warrior, a warrior takes trophies from a dead enemy, and the figure of Fame recites the story of the battle to a man and woman. The scene may be inspired by the Amazonomachy, the mythical war between the Greeks and the Amazons.
*West face – a scene from the &quot;Iliad&quot; and Trojan War, the Greeks and Trojans fighting for the body of Patroclus.
*South face – Cavaliers hunt for wild boar in a forest. One cavalier is wounded and dying in the arms of a companion. This may represent the legend of the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, conducted by Meleager, with Castor and Pollux shown on horseback.

===The triumphal arch of Glanum===

The triumphal arch stood just outside the northern gate of the city, next to the mausoleum and was the visible symbol of Roman power and authority. It was built near the end of the reign of Augustus Caesar (who died in 14 AD). The upper portion of the arch, including the inscription, are missing.

The sculptures decorating the arch illustrated both the civilization of Rome and the dire fate of her enemies. 
*The panel to the right of the entrance shows a female figure seated on a pile of weapons, and a Gaullish prisoner with his hands tied behind him.
*The panel to the left shows another prisoner in a Gaullish cloak, with a smaller man, wearing his cloak in the Roman style, placing his hand on the shoulder of the prisoner.
*On the reverse side of the arch are sculptures of two more pairs of Gaullish prisoners.

==Glanum&#x27;s monumental center==

Glanum was laid out on a north–south axis through the valley of Notre-Dame-du-Vallon. At the northern end was the residential quarter, with the public baths, and at the southern end was the sacred quarter, with the spring and grotto. In the center was the monumental quarter, the site of the forum and public buildings.

The earliest monuments discovered in Glanum were built by the Salyens in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries BC and were strongly influenced by the Hellenic style of the nearby Greek colony of Marseille. They included a large building around a trapezoidal peristyle, or courtyard surrounded by columns; and a sacred well, or , next to a small temple in the Tuscan style.

*The sacred well, or dromos (late 2nd century BC). The well is three meters in diameter and has a stairway with thirty-seven steps which descended to the water. There is no dedication on the temple, but it probably was connected with the sacred nature of the well. The original buildings were destroyed and the well covered over during the construction of the first Roman forum on the same site during the 1st century BC. At the end of Antiquity the well was filled with statuary and debris from the late Roman Empire. The well has been uncovered and fragments of the walls of the temple can be seen.
*The Bouleuterion (2nd–1st centuries BC) was a meeting place for notables, built in the Hellenic style, with an open space with an altar in the center surrounded by stepped rows of seats on three sides. There was a portico with three columns at one end. The northern part of the Bouleuterion was obliterated during Roman times by the construction of the Twin Temples, but the space was preserved and used as a Curia.
*The Hellenic fountain. A small circular stone basin from the period of Greek influence, (2nd-1st centuries BC), probably a fountain, stands next to the road. This is one of the oldest fountains discovered in France.

===The First Roman Forum===

The first Roman forum in Glanum was built around 20 BC, at about the time that Glanum was given the title of &quot;oppidum latinum&quot;.

*The Twin Temples. The main features of the first forum were two Corinthian temples, identical in style but one larger than the other, enclosed on three sides by a peribole, or arcade of columns. Three columns, and a part of the facade, in the style of the early years of the reign of the Emperor Augustus, have been restored/reproduced to give an idea of the building&#x27;s impressive form.
*The Basilica. The first forum had on its northern side a modest basilica with two naves, used as a public hall for transacting business and legal affairs. Only the north corner of the east portico of this building still exists.
*The Monumental fountain. A monumental fountain, dating to about 20 BC, was located on the southern end of the forum. It consisted of a rectangular basin and a semi-circular apse with Corinthian columns, which probably sheltered a statue. The fountain was supplied with water by an aqueduct from the nearby dam.

===The Second Roman Forum===
The second Roman forum, built between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, was the central market, business place, place of justice and site of official religious rituals. A large open space was enclosed on two sides by porticos of columns. On the southern side was a semi-circular excedre, while on the north was the basilica, the large hall that was the palace of justice and seat of government. The basilica was 47 by 24 meters in size, supported by 24 large columns. The facade has disappeared, but the back wall and side walls still exist. Behind the basilica was the curia, where a statue of the Emperor was placed in a niche in the wall. In the center was a square room which served as a tribunal and as the chapel of the cult of the Emperor.

==The residential quarter and the public baths==
The northern part of Glanum, at the bottom of the sloping site, was the residential quarter: the site of villas and of the extensive public baths. The baths were the center of social life, and helped serve to romanize the local population. 
*The Roman baths were built in about 75 BC. Later, during the reign of Lucius Verus (161–169 AD) they were rebuilt and the building clad with marble. Modest in size, they consisted of a pelastre, an open-air exercise area surrounded by an arcade of columns; a hall with cold baths; and two halls heated by a hypocaust, by which hot air was circulated under the rooms through brick channels. One was a hot air sweating room or laconicum, the other a caldarium, or hot bath, including a masonry bathing pool. On the south, next to the pelastre, was a large swimming pool. Water was fed into the pool through the mouth of a stone theatrical mask. The original is now in the nearby museum in St. Remy but a reproduction sits in its original position.
*Hellenistic residences. The quarter contains the ruins of several villas and residences in the Greek style, pre-dating the Roman city. Between the baths and the forum was a house with a Doric peristyle, and another, called the House of Capricorn, with two surviving sections of mosaic floors, one section featuring a capricorn surrounded by four dolphins.

*The Market and the Temple of Cybele. Near the residences was a pre-Roman marketplace, surrounded by Doric columns, with four small shops on the west side. In Roman times half of the marketplace was transformed into a small temple to the Bona Dea, a goddess of the oracle, and later to Cybele. In springtime the priestesses of Cybele brought a sacred pine into the sanctuary, symbolizing the god Atys. In the temple there was also an altar dedicated to the priestess Loreia, with a stone carving of the ears of the goddess, that she might hear prayers.
*The House of the Antae was built in the style of Greek houses around the Mediterranean. A two-storey house with three wings and a portico of Tuscan columns, built around a small basin of water, fed by rainwater from the roof, which channelled the water into a cistern, then into the drains which ran under the pavement of the street. It is named after two fluted antae that flank its doorway.
*The House of Atys (2nd century BC) was named for the castrated lover of Cybele, because of a marble relief of Atys found in the ruins. It had an atrium with a shallow basin, or impluvium, in the center and a well with a curbstone lip, stone benches, and was richly built. It was probably a schola, a reception hall for the college of Dendrophores, associated with the neighboring temple.

==The Valley of the Sacred Spring==
The sacred spring of Glanum is located at the southern and highest part of the town. The valley was closed by a stone wall, built in the late 2nd or early 1st centuries BC. This wall had a gate large enough for chariots, a square tower, and a smaller gate for pedestrians. To the left and right of the gate are vestiges of the older walls, dating from between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC, making a rampart 16 meters high.
*The Doric portico. Just inside the gate was a building with a portico of Doric columns. Vestiges remain of the original structure from the 2nd to 1st century BC. It was rebuilt in about 40 BC, and parts of the columns and portico from this period have been restored. Inside the building were small basins fed by water conduits in the back wall, suggesting that this building was a place where pilgrims to the spring would ritually wash and purify themselves.
*The Temple of Valetudo. This small temple was dedicated to Valetudo, the Roman goddess of health. The inscription indicates that it was built by Agrippa, the future son-in-law of the Emperor Augustus. The Corinthian columns are in the style of the late Roman Republic; it probably dates to Agrippa&#x27;s first voyage to Gaul in 39 BC.
*The Sacred Spring. The spring and its healing powers were the basis of the reputation and wealth of the town. Originally it was simply a basin carved into the rock. In the 2nd century BC it was covered by a stone building with a decorative facade of stones in a fishscale pattern. A stone stairway led from the spring up to the top of the nearby hill. In the 1st century AD the Roman legionnaire M. Licinius Verecundus built an altar to the right of the stairway, dedicated to the god Glanis, the Glannicae, and to Fortuna Redux, the goddess responsible for the safe return of those far from home. The inscription reads: &quot;To the god Glanis, and the Glanicae, and to Fortuna Redux: Marcus Licinius Verecundus, of the tribe Claudia &quot;(an electoral district in Rome)&quot;, veteran of the XXI Legion Rapaces &quot;(Rapaces, or predators, was the nickname of the XXI Legion, which was serving at the time in Germany)&quot; – has accomplished his vow with gratitude and good faith.&quot;
*The Chapel of Hercules. The remains of a small chapel devoted to Hercules, the guardian of springs, is located near the spring. Against the walls, the archeologist Henri Roland discovered six altars to Hercules, and the torso of a large statue of Hercules, 1.3 meters high, holding a vase of water, evidently the water of the Glanum spring. The inscription on the base of the statue indicates that it was placed in gratitude for the safe return of the tribune C. Licinius Macer, and the centurions and soldiers from Glanum from a campaign during the 2nd century AD.

==Glanum in popular culture==
In Robert Holdstock&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Ancient Echoes&quot;, Glanum is a sentient, living, moving city which eventually settles at its present site in Provence.

<doc id="619853" wikidata="Q78828" url="?curid=619853" title="Hans Hass">
<text>Hans Hass (23 January 1919 – 16 June 2013) was an Austrian biologist and underwater diving pioneer. He was known mainly for being among the first scientists to popularise coral reefs, stingrays, octopuses and sharks. He pioneered the making of documentaries filmed underwater and led the development of a type of rebreather. He is also known for his energon theory and his commitment to protecting the environment.

==Early years==
Hass was born in Vienna; his father was an attorney and Hass initially pursued law. However, Hass had a formative encounter with the American diver Guy Gilpatric while on a Riviera holiday in 1938 which included underwater hunting and photography. After making expeditions to the Caribbean Sea and writing his first professional articles in 1938-39, in 1940 Hass switched from reading law to studying zoology and graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1943 at the Faculty of Biology. His thesis was the first scientific research project that used an autonomous rebreather diving equipment. In his early diving he used rebreathers, which he had made for him by the German diving gear makers Dräger: he had these sets made with the breathing bag on his back, as he did not like the bag-on-chest &quot;frogman look&quot;. Hass and his team of researchers logged over 2000 dives utilising oxygen rebreathers from 1942 to 1953.

Although Don Stewart, one of the first scuba operators on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, blames Hass for single-handedly hunting the Atlantic goliath grouper to local extinction in a book by Callum Roberts, the author clearly refutes that claim later in the same paragraph.

==Wartime period==
Hass published &quot;Diving to Adventure,&quot; his first book of underwater photographs, in 1939 and some credit him with developing one of the first underwater cameras. Hass completed his first underwater film called &quot;Pirsch unter Wasser&quot; (&quot;Stalking under Water&quot;) in 1940. It was published by the Universum Film AG, originally lasting only 16 minutes and was shown in cinemas before the main film, but would eventually be extended by additional filming done in the Adriatic Sea close to Dubrovnik.

Hass moved from Vienna to Berlin in 1941, where he founded the tax privileged society &quot;Expedition für biologische Meereskunde&quot; (&quot;Expedition for biological oceanography&quot;).

Hass was excused from serving in the German military during the Second World War because of poor circulation in his feet caused by Raynaud&#x27;s disease.

From the proceeds of his hundreds of lectures, Hass was able to buy the sailing ship &quot;Seeteufel&quot; in 1942. However, he was not able to use the ship for his planned expedition because the ship was in the harbour of Stettin and it was not possible to bring it to the Mediterranean Sea during the war.

Therefore, Hass rented a ship in Piraeus and sailed for several months in the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Crete in 1942. Before the war, this ship had been owned by the University of Vienna. During this expedition he filmed and took photos underwater. Hass had read the book &quot;Die Raubfischer in Hellas&quot; (The Pirate Fishers in Greece) written in 1939 by Werner Helwig. Hass found this group near Skiathos and was able to film their dynamite fishing under water.

In spring and summer of 1943, Hass stayed for several months at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples and Capri to study and collect Bryozoa, aquatic invertebrate animals, for his doctoral thesis in zoology. In February 1944, he completed the thesis to become a Doctor of Science.

Until the end of the war Hass lived and worked in the film studios of Universum Film AG in Babelsberg near Berlin to cut and finish his film about the expedition in the Aegean Sea. This 84 minute underwater film, &quot;Menschen unter Haien&quot; (Men among Sharks), was released in 1947. It shows marine life including wrasse, jellyfish, sponges, sea anemones and rays. The highlights of this film include dynamite fishing and interaction of divers with sharks.

In Babelsberg he met Hannelore Schroth, a famous German actress. Hans and Hannelore married in 1945.

==Post war activity and fame==
In 1945 the &quot;Seeteufel&quot; was lost when the Soviets captured Königsberg.

In 1947 his film &quot;Menschen unter Haien&quot; had its world premiere in Zürich, and his most popular book with a very similar title was released in 1948. As a consequence, he got contracts with Herzog-Film (Munich) and Sascha-Film (Vienna). He also went on his first expedition with his new research ship named &#x27;Xarifa&#x27;, which was mostly financed through photo safaris in the Red Sea and by the BBC.

Hass&#x27;s marriage to Hannelore Schroth produced a son, Hans Hass, Jr. The marriage ended in 1950 and he married his second wife, Lotte Baierl, that same year.

Hass produced 105 commercial films, many featuring himself and his second wife, who was an expert diver. In 1951, Hass&#x27;s film &quot;Under the Red Sea&quot; was awarded the first prize at the Venice Film Festival.

After expeditions in East Africa and South Asia, his first TV series was developed in 1959, in 1961 for the first time about creatures outside the water. This was followed by behavioural research and the &#x27;energon theory&#x27; from 1963 to 1966. From his behavioural research, Hass formed his energon hypothesis, the focus of his work in later years. It posits that the behaviours of all life-forms — human, nonhuman animal and plant — have common origins. Combined with management strategies, Hass published about commonalities with evolution in 1969. In the 1970s he addressed environmental and commercial themes and was appointed to a professorship by the University of Vienna. In 1983, he started long term studies and tutorials about predatory instincts in profession. Hass consolidated marine biology, behaviour research and management theories under one umbrella. He believed that his energon theory could not be disproved. In 1989, he addressed himself to environmental themes.

After the Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt disappeared in the waters of Cheviot Beach at Portsea, Victoria on 17 December 1967, Hass visited Australia and explored the area where Holt disappeared for his 1971 film documentary &quot;Das Geheimnis der Cheviot Bay&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Cheviot Bay&quot;). In an interview with Harry Martin for the ABC&#x27;s current affairs programme &quot;A.M&quot; Hass said that having observed the underwater conditions of the area with its sharp and jagged rocks, he was convinced that Holt had been trapped in the structure of one of these rocks and his body considerably torn by the nature of the forces of the sea and the sharp rocks.

Hass acknowledged a rivalry with the better-known French scientist Jacques Cousteau; according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, Hass told historian Tim Ecott that &quot;For Cousteau there exists only Cousteau. He never acknowledged others or corrected the impression that he wasn&#x27;t the first in diving or underwater photography.&quot;

Hass died on 16 June 2013 in Vienna. He was 94 and was survived by his wife and daughter Meta. Lotte Hass died in January 2015. Hass&#x27;s son Hans Hass Jr., an actor and composer, committed suicide in 2009.
In 2002 the Historical Diving Society established the &quot;Hans Hass Award&quot; which is awarded to individuals that display international achievement in underwater science, technology, or arts and literature.

<text>Etherow Country Park is in Compstall, a village between Marple Bridge and Romiley, in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is a Local Nature Reserve and the starting point of the Goyt Way.

==Description==
Etherow was one of England&#x27;s first country parks. Originally it was an industrial area incorporating a mine, a mill and a mill pond. The River Etherow flows through the park and is the source for the mill pond. With the decline of industry, the mill pond and park have become a nature reserve and a place for people to spend time walking and taking in the peaceful surroundings.

== Reserve ==

Compstall Nature Reserve is a region of the park which was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1977; this was for its biological interest, especially its wide range of habitats including open water, tall fen, reed swamp, carr and mixed deciduous woodland. 

The site is also of considerable ornithological interest with water rail, an uncommon species, having been recorded.

==Community groups and clubs==
Etherow Country Park has many local groups associated with it:
* A small sailing club which has good results nationally; in 2014, it finished 17th of 64 entrants in the Southport 24 Hour Race. 
* The Friends of Etherow is a small local community group 
* There are also anglers and model boaters clubs.

<doc id="619878" wikidata="Q1792885" url="?curid=619878" title="Avonmouth">
<text>Avonmouth ( ) is a port and outer suburb of Bristol, England, on the north bank of the mouth of the River Avon and the eastern shore of the Severn Estuary. Part of the Port of Bristol, Avonmouth Docks is important to the region&#x27;s maritime economy, hosting large vessels for the unloading and exporting of heavier goods. Much of the land use is industrial, including warehousing, light industry, electrical power and sanitation. The M5 motorway bisects the neighbourhood, with junctions onto the A4 road and M49 motorway, and it has stations on the Severn Beach Line railway.

Avonmouth is part of the Bristol City Council electoral ward of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston, which also includes Shirehampton and the western end of Lawrence Weston.

== Geography ==

Avonmouth is approximately rectangular, its length favouring the Severn shore, and sits on the north bank of the Avon, west-north-west of Bristol city centre. Both estuaries have been defensively embanked, primarily to allow the construction of the large Avonmouth Docks, which occupy most of the western part. The related Royal Portbury Dock is across the Avon (in Easton-in-Gordano). Avonmouth is home to chemical manufacturing plants, and north of the Avonmouth Docks is the gas-fired Seabank Power Station. Its light industrial and warehouse companies include Nisbets.

Avonmouth is the only part of Bristol west of the M5 motorway. The long-established residential area is between the industrialised zone and the motorway. The Avonmouth Bridge takes the motorway over the Avon to Somerset. The M49 motorway runs from the M5 at Avonmouth north to the M4 motorway at the Second Severn Crossing to Wales. The old Severn Bridge and the M48 motorway are linked to Avonmouth by the A403. The Welsh cities of Newport and Cardiff are visible from Avonmouth&#x27;s coastline.

The Portway, part of the A4, connects Avonmouth with the centre of Bristol. Avonmouth is also served by a usually hourly train service on the Severn Beach Line to central Bristol from Avonmouth railway station, Portway Park &amp; Ride (in the southeast of the neighbourhood) and St Andrews Road (in the western industrial zone).

A new deep-sea container terminal has been proposed for Avonmouth.

== History ==
The mouth of the Avon was recorded as &quot;Afenemuþan&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the years 915 or 918 and 1052, but it is clear from the context that the name does not refer to a settlement. The area was historically part of the chapelry of Shirehampton, a detached part of the ancient parish of Westbury-on-Trym in Gloucestershire. Bewys Cross, a stone monument possibly dating from the 15th century, was located on the bank of the Severn close to the old mouth of the Avon. Early 19th-century maps show the area as farmland. At that time the deep-water channel of the Avon ran through the present-day site of Avonmouth Docks, and separated the mainland from a small island named Dumball Island.
The first development at Avonmouth was a landing stage built in 1860 by Bristol Corporation at &quot;Avon&#x27;s Mouth&quot;. The first record of the modern name was in the title of the Port and Channel Docks (Avonmouth Dock) Bill debated in Parliament in early 1863. When the Bristol Port Railway and Pier was built in 1865 the terminus station was named Avonmouth. A hotel, the Avonmouth Hotel, was opened at the same time. A small new village was built to serve the new docks, which were finally opened in 1877. Also in 1877, the BPRP line was connected to the main railway network by the Clifton Extension Railway, and a new railway station named Avonmouth Dock was opened by the docks. Bricks for the docks were supplied by the Crown Brick Works in West Town, Shirehampton, visible on the 1879 Ordnance Survey map. The Crown Brick Works were owned by Edwin Stride, with his sons Jared and Jethro (who later developed Sneyd Park), together with George Davis and William and Jarman Peters. The Crown Brick Works company was dissolved in 1886.

The new Avonmouth Dock and the original nucleus of the settlement were transferred from Gloucestershire to the City of Bristol in 1894, and the rest of the expanding settlement became part of the City in 1904.

Work began in 1902 on the Royal Edward Dock, a major expansion of the docks, completed in 1908. Land required for the expansion necessitated the closure of the original station, and from 1902 all trains terminated at Avonmouth Dock station (renamed &quot;Avonmouth&quot; in 1966). However, the Avonmouth Hotel adjacent to the original station remained open. It provided accommodation for many Europeans emigrating to the Americas via Avonmouth, and during the First World War it housed the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps. It was finally demolished in 1926 when the Royal Edward Dock was expanded.

Between 1919 and 1926, the Portway was built, providing more direct road access to Avonmouth from Bristol.

Shirehampton had become a separate parish in 1844, and a Church of England chapel was established in the new settlement of Avonmouth late in the nineteenth century. Avonmouth became a separate parish in 1917. Avonmouth&#x27;s first church, completed in 1934, was bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1941 during the Second World War, in one of the six major raids of the Bristol Blitz. It was rebuilt in 1957.

In December 1971, the M5 motorway was opened to Avonmouth, and extended south into Somerset when the Avonmouth Bridge was opened in May 1974.

On 3 December 2020, four people were killed in an explosion at the water treatment plant.

== Local places of interest ==

=== Avonmouth Sewage Works Nature Reserve ===
The Avonmouth Sewage Treatment Works is managed as a nature reserve by Wessex Water. The human-made lagoons and a pool provide a feeding and resting area for many birds including ducks such as pochard, tufted duck, teal and shoveler. The rough grassland provides a refuge for voles, great crested newt and other small mammals, which are preyed upon by kestrels and barn owls.

=== The Range Distribution Centre ===
Avonmouth is home to the largest single footprint warehouse in the United Kingdom, a 1,250,000 sq ft portal frame building operated by The Range as a distribution centre. The enormous building occupies 55 acres of land and is part of the Central Park project located close to the Severn estuary shoreline. Previously, the largest single footprint warehouse in the United Kingdom was a building operated by Amazon in Dunfermline, Scotland which covers 1,000,000 sq ft.

== Governance ==
Avonmouth is part of the Bristol North West constituency, which elects a member of Parliament (MP).

Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston is an electoral ward electing three councillors to Bristol City Council. Apart from Avonmouth itself, the ward includes Shirehampton and part of Lawrence Weston.
Shirehampton is a part of Bristol which has a medieval-founded village nucleus and contains buildings dating more than a century earlier than the earliest examples in Avonmouth. Today the pre-1893 mother parish of Shirehampton has definitive boundaries and 6,867 inhabitants. Shirehampton railway station provides travel to the city centre. The western end of the Lawrence Weston area crosses the boundary into the Avonmouth ward, however the majority of the area falls within the Kingsweston ward. The combined area is separated from the rest of Bristol by a small amount of green land, see buffer zones.

==Famous People==
Comedian Lee Evans was born in Avonmouth on 25 February 1964.

<doc id="619881" wikidata="Q4891880" url="?curid=619881" title="IBM TopView">
<text>TopView is the first object-oriented, multitasking, and windowing, personal computer operating environment for PC DOS developed by IBM, announced in August 1984 and shipped in March 1985. TopView provided a text-mode (although it also ran in graphics mode) operating environment that allowed users to run more than one application at the same time on a PC. IBM demonstrated an early version of the product to key customers before making it generally available, around the time they shipped their new PC AT computer.

== History ==
When Microsoft announced Windows 1.0 in November 1983, International Business Machines (IBM), Microsoft&#x27;s important partner in popularizing MS-DOS for the IBM PC, notably did not announce support for the forthcoming window environment. IBM determined that the microcomputer market needed a multitasking environment. When it released TopView in 1985, the press speculated that the software was the start of IBM&#x27;s plan to increase its control over the IBM PC (even though IBM published the specifications publicly) by creating a proprietary operating system for it, similar to what IBM had offered for years on its larger computers. TopView also allowed IBM to serve customers who were surprised that the new IBM AT did not come with an operating system able to use the hardware multitasking and protected mode features of the new 80286 CPU, as DOS and most applications were still running in 8086/8088 real mode.

Even given TopView&#x27;s virtual memory management capabilities, hardware limitations still held the new environment back—a base AT with 256 KB of RAM only had room for 80 KB of application code and data in RAM once DOS and TopView had loaded up. 512-640 KB was recommended to load up two typical application programs of the time. This was the maximum the earlier IBM XT could have installed. Once loaded, TopView took back much of the memory consumed by DOS, but still not enough to satisfy industry critics. TopView ran in real mode on any x86 processor and could run well behaved DOS programs (i.e. programs that did not write directly to the screen but used BIOS int 10h and DOS int 21h, such as the IBM Assistant Series of productivity programs) in an arrangement of windows. Well behaved applications would use standard DOS and BIOS function calls to access system services and hardware. Misbehaving programs (i.e. such as programs that did write directly to the screen) such as Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar and dBase III would still run in the TopView environment, but would consume the entire screen. Object-oriented applications were written using the TopView API. TopView was developed to run on the 8088 (and required what IBM referred to as a fixed disk) and later the 80286. TopView was not updated to make use of the virtual 8086 mode added in the Intel 80386 processors that allowed better virtualization.

Initially, compatibility with the extended features was limited mainly to IBM applications, along with a few third-party products like WordPerfect and VolksWriter. A chicken-and-egg situation developed where third-party developers were reluctant to add extended feature support (such as block insert and delete to allow users to do cut/copy/paste between applications) when they did not see market demand for them. Most DOS programs did, however, support these functions and did allow the user to perform the cut, copy, and paste operations by using the TopView pop-up menus.

Some believed that IBM planned to use TopView to force reliance on them to comply with the new technical specifications. As later versions of TopView were released, it was able to successfully make more challenging DOS apps run in a multitasking fashion by intercepting direct access to system services and hardware.

TopView first introduced Program Information Files (PIF files), which defined how a given DOS program should be run in a multi-tasking environment, notably to avoid giving it unnecessary resources which could remain available to other programs. TopView&#x27;s PIF files were inherited and extended by Quarterdeck&#x27;s DESQview and Microsoft Windows. The concept of Program Information Files was also used under Digital Research operating systems such as Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, Datapac System Manager and REAL/32; however, using the PIFED command, the necessary program information got directly embedded into the .EXE or .COM executable file.

== Version history ==
Version 1.1, introduced in June 1986, added support for the IBM PC Network and IBM 3270 terminal emulation. Importantly, support for swapping non-resident programs was added—onto the hard disk on all computers and into the high memory area on machines equipped with a 286 CPU. The initially poor support for DOS batch files was improved.

Version 1.12, introduced in April 1987, added support for the new IBM PS/2 series, their DOS 3.30 operating system, and their new PS/2 mice. It could also now use up to four serial ports.

== Decline and discontinuation ==
TopView sold below expectations from the start, with many potential users already satisfied with cheaper, less memory-intensive terminate-and-stay-resident task switchers like Ready, Spotlight, and Borland Sidekick which didn&#x27;t need a multitasking environment. TopView ran in graphics mode (TOPVIEW /G); however, this was rarely used. By mid-1987, IBM began to shift focus away from TopView and was promoting the use of OS/2 to developers and end users alike. OS/2 1.0 was a pre-emptive multitasking, multithreading OS that allowed one real mode and multiple 16-bit protected mode sessions to run at the same time on the PC/AT based 80286 and provided as a DOS alternative announced in April 1987 and made available later that December. A graphical user interface (Presentation Manager) was added with OS/2 1.1 in October 1988. 1.1 could run with or without Presentation Manager as well as an embedded system with no screen, keyboard or mouse interface required. IBM officially stopped marketing the final release of TopView, version 1.12, on 3 July 1990. TopView&#x27;s concept was carried forward by other DOS multitaskers, most notably Quarterdeck&#x27;s DESQview, which retained TopView&#x27;s user interface and many features, plus added more features such as support for the special features of the 80286, 80386 and compatible processors, and, with DESQview/X (released in June 1992), a true GUI interface running on DOS. A variety of similar programs to TopView were also available, including one from Dynamical Systems called Mondrian, which Microsoft bought in 1986 with the stated intention of implementing TopView API compatibility into Windows which never happened. Later in April 1992, IBM introduced OS/2 2.0 which included virtual 8086 mode and full 32-bit support of the Intel 80386 superseding even DESQview and other similar environments. OS/2 2.0 was a priority based preemptive multitasking multithreading OS including 32 levels of priority (from time critical to idle time) for the 386.

TopView requires IBM PC DOS versions 2.0 to 5.0 or MS-DOS 2.0 to 6.0, and will not run with later releases.

Key contributors to TopView included David Morrill (the &quot;father of TopView&quot; code-named &quot;Orion&quot; once the GLASS project was moved to Boca Raton), Dennis McKinley (tasking), Ross Cook (memory management), Bob Hobbs (TopView Toolkit) and Neal Whitten (product manager). Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Gordon Letwin and other key Microsoft executives accepted an invitation from IBM executive Don Estridge to IBM Boca Raton to see a special demonstration of TopView. Gates was disturbed that Windows did not have the multitasking (Windows used a cooperative method to share the CPU) and windowing capabilities (i.e. overlapping windows, etc.) that TopView had. Gates witnessed TopView running multiple copies of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter running in windows (overlapping and side-by-side) in a multitasking fashion. Microsoft later released a multitasking version of MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking) from what it learned from the meeting. Even though there was no joint development agreement with Microsoft for the development of TopView, Estridge asked and later told Whitten (against Whitten&#x27;s and the TopView team&#x27;s wishes) to turn over all source code and documentation of TopView to Microsoft. Within a short time after the meeting, Estridge&#x27;s request was granted. Gates gave the code and documentation to a group headed by Nathan Myhrvold. Once the code had been modified according to Gates&#x27; specifications, he purchased the company. The product itself, Mondrian, was never released. Gates, however, gave members of the team key positions at Microsoft. This led to a Joint Development Agreement with Microsoft (an agreement that previously only included DOS) to co-develop OS/2 (an agreement that lasted until 1990). This was all done in order to satisfy the USA vs. IBM anti-trust court case that was filed in 1969. Even though it was dismissed in 1982, IBM was mired in antitrust troubles for more than a decade after the dismissal and did not recover from the legal morass until the early to mid-90s. In June 1990 an FTC probe was launched into possible collusion between Microsoft and IBM in the PC software market.

==Reception==
&quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1985 described TopView as &quot;bland, plain vanilla software that hogs far too much memory&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; also criticized TopView&#x27;s memory usage, but stated that &quot;you will find that most software written for the IBM PC is TopView-compatible&quot;. Noting the low price and &quot;innovative multitasking features&quot;, the magazine predicted that the software &quot;will attract a lot of takers&quot;.

In 1985, Digital Research positioned their multitasking Concurrent DOS 4.1 with GEM as alternative for TopView.

<doc id="619884" wikidata="Q7643418" url="?curid=619884" title="Superheist">
<text>Superheist are an Australian nu metal band formed in 1993 by mainstay guitarist and backing vocalist DW Norton. They have released five studio albums, the first two, &quot;The Prize Recruit&quot; (2001) and &quot;Identical Remote Controlled Reactions&quot; (2002), reached the top 20 on the ARIA albums chart Four singles, &quot;Crank the System&quot; (2000), &quot;Bullet&quot; (2001), &quot;7 Years&quot; and &quot;A Dignified Rage&quot; (both 2002) peaked in the ARIA singles chart top 50. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 their producer-engineer Kalju Tonuma was nominated for Producer of the Year and Engineer of the Year for &quot;The Prize Recruit&quot;. At the 2002 ceremony, Norton and Adam Rhodes were nominated for Engineer of the Year for &quot;A Dignified Rage&quot;. They disbanded in 2004. After a twelve-year hiatus, Norton reformed Superheist with new members. Their third studio album &quot;Ghosts of the Social Dead&quot; (2016) reached No. 3 on the AIR Charts. They issued two non-charting studio albums, &quot;Sidewinder&quot; (May 2019) and &quot;MMXX&quot; (July 2022). Founding drummer Sean Pentecost died in 2020.

==History==
===Formation and early period (1993–1996)===
Superheist were formed in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston, Victoria in 1993. The original line-up was Rod &quot;Berger&quot; McLeod on lead vocals, DW Norton on guitar and backing vocals, Sean &quot;Seanheist&quot; Pentecost on drums, Fetah Sabawi on keyboards and samples, and Adrian Sudborough on bass guitar. The band were originally to be named Orgheist, which was inspired by European grind core bands. Their main influences were Faith No More, Fear Factory and Limp Bizkit. The name was altered to Superheist, McLeod supplied the &quot;Super&quot; while Norton provided the &quot;Heist&quot;. McLeod and Norton had met at Overport primary school in Frankston, Victoria in 1980 and later attended Frankston High School together. Sabawi also attended Frankston High. Pentecost was a mutual friend who worked at a local music store, Frankston Guitar Village, and had previously played with Norton, Mcleod and Sudborough in the alt rock band Big Pop Monsters.
Superheist&#x27;s first live performance was at the 21st Century Dance Club, Frankston supporting the Cosmic Psychos. In 1994 they issued a five-track extended play cassette, &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, which was recorded at Backbeach Studios in Rye, Victoria with Norton producing and released independently; it was later distributed via Warhead records, The band&#x27;s early style was grindcore, à la Napalm Death, with synthesiser tones, samples and clean vocals amongst brutal blast beats and death growls. The band tempered their extreme metal with pop and nu-wave melodies and hook lines.

The EP received positive reviews and the band toured nationally. Later that year Sudborough was replaced on bass guitar by Adam &quot;Donut&quot; Donath. They continued touring, alongside In:Extremis, Damaged and Beanflipper. Superheist became a regular on Melbourne&#x27;s grind scene and played at The GB and The Hell Club. In December 1995 they performed at the annual Metal for the Brain festival, Canberra, which raised funds for the National Brain Injury Foundation. They returned for the 1996 festival, but Pentecost had already left the group due to losing interest in extreme metal. Aaren &quot;Suds&quot; Suttil (1974–2006) of Dreadnaught joined on drums.

===&quot;Chrome Matrix&quot; (1997–1998)===

In September 1997, the band signed to Melbourne&#x27;s Shock Records&#x27; subsidiary label Cutthroat and released a five-track EP, &quot;Chrome Matrix&quot;. This EP demonstrated their shift from grindcore to industrial style, death metal. More samples and clean vocals were introduced with greater emphasis on keyboards and loops. The band experimented with re-mixes on &quot;Platinum Matrix&quot;. The track &quot;Subhuman&quot; showcased the versatility of McLeod&#x27;s vocals and clever lyrics. The EP had two hidden tracks from &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Retarded Barbie&quot; and &quot;Perfect World&quot;. During the recording Donath severed his thumb in an industrial accident and was unable to finish his parts. The remaining bass guitar parts fwere completed by Norton, while Donath recovered. Local Melbourne artist Barney &quot;Barnaby Butters&quot; Hughes (deceased) joined the group on bass guitar for several live shows.

More line-up changes ensued with Suttil focussing on Dreadnaught so he was replaced on drums by Adam Messenger (of In:Extremis) for live shows and recording tracks, &quot;Times Killing&quot; and &quot;Pocket Full of Lies&quot;, which later appeared on a live album, &quot;New Rare Live&quot; (2004). In late 1998, Pentecost rejoined the group on drums. Their new sound continued the shift away from grindcore and industrial death metal to a nu metal. They prepared material for another EP, &quot;8 Miles High&quot; and developed Superheist&#x27;s bouncing metal sound. The post &quot;Chrome Matrix&quot; work included early versions of &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Fluid&quot; and &quot;Syncin&#x27; In&quot;. Chris Ainsworth (Back Beach Studios&#x27; owner Mark Rachelle&#x27;s friend) temporarily provided keyboards and samples while Sabawi travelled overseas. Superheist played shows along the east coast. The band struggled to maintain audience numbers at their live shows. Also in 1998 Superheist announced Simon &quot;Si&quot; Durrant, of In:Extremis, as the band&#x27;s bass guitarist replacing Donath, who never regained his full playing ability.

===&quot;8 Miles High&quot; and the beginning of commercial success (1998–2000)===

Sabawi returned to Australia in 1998 and rejoined the band. They released two singles, &quot;Two-Faced (Check Your Head Up)&quot; (1998) and &quot;Karma&quot; (1999) and performed on the Vans Warped Tour. Then they supported Fear Factory on their Australian east coast tour. In June 1999 Superheist toured nationally backing Sepultura, Durrant caused hundreds of dollars of damagein a hotel room in Brisbane. The band were investigated by Queensland Police and subsequently, Durrant left the band to return to Adelaide where he joined a short-lived project, Screwface:13. He was replaced in August by Melbourne session bass guitarist, Drew Dedman (ex Iconklast), who had met DW (by this time a studio producer) while recording bass tracks at Back Beach Recording studio. A brief East Coast and South Australian tour followed. With the band&#x27;s sound changing, some fans struggled to connect with their new direction. Returning to Melbourne, they filmed their first music video for a proposed single, &quot;Have Your Way&quot;. Although never officially released, it was distributed by Shock as promotion for the later releases.

In October 1999, Superheist recorded a cover version of &quot;Walls&quot; by the Flowers at the ABC studios in South Melbourne. It was featured by national youth radio station Triple J on Australian music month, in November. The group supported the Screaming Jets, returned to Canberra for Metal for the Brainh and a handful of local and east coast shows. They performed at the 1999 Falls Festival, New Year&#x27;s Eve, which had them showcase their new sound to a larger audience. At Shock Records, Shagpile label was discontinued and Superheist had neither the budget nor time to record new tracks with Dedman for a full studio album, so &quot;8 Miles High&quot; had been down to eight tracks on an EP in January 2000. Although Dedman appeared on its artwork and was credited as bass player, all the bass tracks were played by either Durrant or Norton. The track &quot;Pulse&quot; received airplay on Triple J and was included on a various artists&#x27; compilation album, &quot;Full Metal Racket&quot;. Also in January, Dedman joined as a full-time member providing the band&#x27;s rhythm section with a better sound.

&quot;8 Miles High&quot; tracks made an impact on the Australian alternative charts, &quot;Pulse&quot;, &quot;Two-Faced&quot;, &quot;Karma&quot; and &quot;Have Your Way&quot; received significant airplay. This led to a support slot for Grinspoon on their Australian tour in February 2000. This tour established the band on a national level. As a result they were signed by talent manager Gregg Donovan (Grinspoon, Airbourne). &quot;Pulse&quot; was shelved as a single in favour of a remixed, re-released version of &quot;Two Faced&quot;. The band had a music video filmed in Melbourne, however the single&#x27;s cover used a new band logo, in the style of US nu-metal band, Limp Bizkit. This occurred without the band&#x27;s permission and was removed from circulation upon the band&#x27;s complaints. Superheist&#x27;s relationship with Shock Records was severely tested by the label making poor decisions without consultation.

===&quot;The Prize Recruit&quot; (2000–2002)===

In mid-2000 Superheist members began writing and recording their debut album, &quot;The Prize Recruit&quot; (April 2001). Producer Kalju Tonuma, (Bodyjar, Hunters and Collectors, 28 Days), worked at Sing Sing Studios, Melbourne. Vocals and overdubs for the album were recorded at a beach house in Portsea Victoria. &quot;Crank the System&quot; was released in November 2000 as its lead single and their first on Shock Records&#x27; new subsidiary, Pivotal. It peaked at No. 45 on the ARIA singles chart. &quot;Bullet&quot;, the second single, appeared in March 2001, which also reached No. 45. It became a popular live track for Superheist. &quot;The Prize Recruit&quot; debuted at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. A reviewer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;what the new heavy breed should sound like&quot;. &quot;Theprp.com&quot; website&#x27;s Wookubus felt the album is &quot;a very lush and colorful ride that the listener can figuratively slip right through, with little to no snags. Sure there are a few moments where things become a little too overtly radio friendly or sound a bit commercially focused, but with the bulk of the material included representing an eclectic blend of energetic modern metal crunch, such things are easy enough to overlook&quot;.

The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Step Back&quot;/&quot;Slide&quot; (July), had less chart success, but it reached the top 100. In August Superheist supported Eminem at his Sydney and Melbourne concerts. They played to over 25,000 people in two nights; their popularity was high and they undertook a 40 show Australian tour. At the 2001 ARIA Music Awards Tonuma was nominated for Producer of the Year and Engineer of the Year for his work on the album. In March of the following year, a Shock Records representative claimed they had spent $250–300,000 on it and despite sales approaching 35,000 units they were short of covering expenses. In mid-2001 Superheist announced their first US tour was due from late October. With US management provided by Gary Avila or Bigtime Management Paparoach, they based themselves in West Hollywood. The group performed at SIR Studios in Hollywood for record executives and journalists. The band played a tight and energetic set. Onlookers were impressed and over the next few weeks a bidding war began for a US recording deal. With commitments back in Australia, they returned home on 5 September 2001. However due to the September 11 attacks all negotiations with perspective record labels were delayed until February 2002. By then, interest in Superheist had dissipated: they had missed their opportunity.

Norton moved their sound away from &quot;rap rock&quot; to a more straight rock metal sound, which annoyed McLeod. McLeod distanced himself from fellow members. In a meeting with management, McLeod stated he would &quot;only play the big shows and the band would be dropped by the record company should he decide to leave&quot;. In mid-November Superheist were due to tour with the Channel V Music Bus. The night before, the band played at Berwick youth centre. Mcleod claimed to be unwell and refused to perform, the event was sold out and other band members refused to cancel their show. They found a replacement vocalist, Joey Biro (of From the Inside). Biro pleased the crowd and band. McLeod refused to attend the Channel V Music Bus tour so Superheist invited Biro to replace him. Biro and the band toured through regional Victoria and New South Wales. Fellow band members believed that McLeod no longer shared their commitment; after consultation with management and record label, McLeod was fired and permanently replaced by Biro. In the following year, Bridget Porich of &quot;Ozmusic Central&quot; reflected on the transition, &quot;the vocal similarity is quite outstanding and few bands manage to sustain the same amount of talent, success and fans after the change of a lead man.&quot;

===&quot;Identical Remote Controlled Reactions&quot; (2002–2004)===
In 2002 Superheist played several major festivals in Australia including a main stage slot on the Big Day Out in Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth in January–February. Biro won over fans with heartfelt performances and powerful voice. The group began work on their second album, &quot;Identical Remote Controlled Reactions&quot; (September 2002). It was recorded at Sing Sing Studios with Norton, Sabawi and Adam Rhodes (Dirty Three) co-producing, which peaked at No. 20. The lead single, &quot;7 Years&quot;, had appeared in May, which reached No. 29 – their highest-charting single. It was followed in August by a semi-acoustic rock ballad, &quot;A Dignified Rage&quot;, which peaked at No. 50.

At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards, Norton and Rhodes were nominated for Engineer of the Year for &quot;A Dignified Rage&quot;. The sound was generally heavier than &quot;The Prize Recruit&quot; but showed a maturity in the songwriting and playing. Biro&#x27;s emotive vocal style lending to a more epic version of Superheist&#x27;s bouncing heavy rock riff style. The group co-headlined the Kings of Rock Tour with New Zealand hard rockers Shihad (then-known as Pacifier). Sean Kemp of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; described their set, &quot;Biro (Vocals) does it better than previous front man [McLeod]. He works the crowd with more superiority, has an instinctive feel and fits in well with [Norton] who is in charge of guitar and harmonies.&quot; They played major rock festivals late in 2002, abutnd finished the year with a disppointing New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Hastings, Victoria. Dedman quit the band that night and returned to his home in northern NSW refusing to speak to other members for months of 2003.

Superheist performed on the Crusty Demons of Dirt Nine Lives Tour before June 2003. In July of that year the band travelled to the US for another tour. They played shows at the Viper Room, the Roxy and several showcases but were unable to sign a major international record deal. They returned to Australia and undertook east coast tours. On 8 August they recorded a live set at the Corner Hotel, Richmond. This was released as disc two of &quot;New, Rare, Live&quot; (November 2004). Late in 2003, Superheist were dropped by Step2 Artist management. Disagreements between band members began to surface. Nevertheless, the band continued to write and record demos for the third album without a bass guitarist, Norton recorded the bass on the demos during this time. They had persuaded Dedman to rejoin and began writing and rehearsing. Superheist were billed to appear at Metal for the Brain in December, however, in October they cancelled. The band&#x27;s tour of North Queensland during December and demoing tracks for their next album was taking too long. Failure to hire a new manager, inconsistent performances and tensions between Norton and Biro were problematic. Upon return to Melbourne, Biro was fired in January. More demo recording followed. In February 2004 Norton announced that Superheist had disbanded.

During their career they had achieved significant chart success with four singles appearing in the top 50 and two studio albums entering the top 20. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described them as &quot;Melbourne&#x27;s premier nu metal act for 10 years... [with an] extreme down-turned sound.&quot; He praised Biro on their second album, &quot;who didn&#x27;t incorporate rap into his vocal delviery&quot;, while the group delivered &quot;cleaner (yet still heavy) alternative metal sound&quot;. Greg Lawrence of &quot;Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online&quot; (WHAMMO) had described McLeod as a &quot;lyric writer and vocalist&quot;, who &quot;likes to party hard but who works at his craft with determination&quot;. Whereas the band delivered a &quot;mix of hard rock, punk and edgy electro-influenced sounds&quot;.

===&quot;New, Rare, Live&quot; and post Heist (2004–2015)===

Norton curated a &quot;goodbye&quot; compilation and live album, &quot;New, Rare, Live&quot;, using previously unreleased material, recently recorded demos and a live recording. Norton added a non-band track, &quot;The Road&quot;, which was written with Cam Baines (of Bodyjar) and Phil Rose (ex-Nursery Crimes). Baines recorded his vocals at Norton&#x27;s &quot;Cabin in the woods&quot; in remote Victoria. It is followed by four demo tracks and some rarities including the title track of &quot;8 Miles High&quot;, which had been omitted from the EP. In November 2004 it was issued as a 2-CD set. Artwork was by Melbourne designer Richard DeSilva who also worked on &quot;Identical Remote Controlled Reactions&quot;. Drew Dedman formed an improvised jazz band, the Lounge Machine in 2004 and played with Melbourne drum and bass act K-Oscillate in 2005–2006.

In 2006 Dedman and Norton started preparing new tracks with Matt &quot;Skitz&quot; Sanders from Damaged on drums, Pentecost had injured his leg and was unable to commit to recording. Three tracks were partially recorded but not finished. Another attempt at reformation of Superheist occurred in 2008 with Biro, Dedman, Norton and Pentecost rehearsing old work and jamming new material. Personality clashes, old grievances and bad timing made the reformation stall. Also in that year Biro reunited with Dedman to form metal core band, Lanstrum. They released three demo singles before separating in 2010 due to personality clashes. Norton took time out from music, retiring from studio producing in 2011 and going into business. In 2012 all five members of the &quot;Identical Remote Controlled Reaction&quot;s line-up met at Norton&#x27;s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, but once again no reformation occurred. In 2014, after a trip to Egypt, Norton returned to music: writing and recording material for a solo project Rifleman. Dedman has played with experimental electronic band XXIII and in late 2015 he joined Melbourne rocker group, the Arcane Saints.

===Reformation and &quot;Ghosts of the Social Dead&quot; (2016–2019)===

Superheist announced their reformation on 26 June 2016, with a third studio album, &quot;Ghosts of the Social Dead&quot;, to be issued on 28 October. Joining Dedman and Norton were former Electrik Dynamite drummer Benny Clark as Pentecost was unable to rejoin for personal reasons. In August they released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Hands Up High&quot; and related video. They revealed that Ezekiel Ox (of Full Scale Revolution, ex-Mammal, Over-reactor) as their new vocalist. The video was produced and directed by Gareth McGilvray. A second single, &quot;Fearing Nothing&quot;, was released on 7 October, which was produced by Jay Baumgardner at NRG studios, North Hollywood. The music video was produced and directed by Brian Cox from Flarelight Films, it was shot in the Hollywood Hills.

Superheist followed with an Australian capital cities tour and filmed their third music video, &quot;Wolves in Your Headspace&quot; (November 2018). In early 2017 they announced new interstate shows and the artwork for their Scorched Earth national tour. In late January Clark was asked to leave and Dedman quit. Norton and Ox continued to write the band&#x27;s material and their next single, &quot;Raise Hell&quot;, was issued in February 2017. Also in that month, via &quot;the Music.com.au&quot; website, Norton and Ox announced that Durrant would resume bass guitar, joining live members Keir Gotcher (guitar) and Andy Sorenson (keyboards) on tour, to fulfill their Queensland tour dates. Two days later Superheist announced, via Facebook, that John Sankey (Devolved, Light the Torch) would be their new drummer. In April 2018 Superheist announced a Now &amp; Then package comprising a remastered version of their demo &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, a new six-track EP &quot;Lights&quot; and a compilation album, &quot;The History Between Us&quot;, which were released on 27 April.

===&quot;Sidewinder&quot;, Ezekiel Ox departs, &quot;MMXX&quot; (2019–present)===
Superheist released a new single, &quot;The Riot&quot; (April 2019) and had announced their fourth album &quot;Sidewinder&quot; was due on 3 May. It was issued on Norton&#x27;s own label, Black Mountain Music after he recorded and mixed it at his Black Mountain Sound Studio. &quot;Sidewinder&quot; is a continuation from the &quot;Raise Hell&quot; release with its use of 8 string guitars. In April 2019 the line up of Durrant, Gotcher, Norton, Ox and Sankey undertook the inaugural HeistFest tour of Australia with Alaskan metalcore band, 36 Crazyfists. On 1 July 2020, Ox announced, through social media, that he had left Superheist. Founding Superheist drummer Sean Pentecost died on 18 August 2020 after some years of poor health.

In December 2020, Superheist&#x27;s social media revealed a song, &quot;Medicated&quot;, before removing it several hours later, and announced that their next album &quot;MMXX&quot; was expected in February 2021. Later in December 2020, they released a track, &quot;Seize the Day&quot;, which was dedicated to Sean &quot;Seanheist&quot; Pentecost. It was provided as a free digital download on Bandcamp. It has both Norton and Durrant on lead vocals and also features former member Dedman on bass guitar. The release of &quot;MMXX&quot; was delayed until July 2022.

<doc id="619887" wikidata="Q1180978" url="?curid=619887" title="Deakin University">
<text>Deakin University is a public university in Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1974, the university was named after Alfred Deakin, the second Prime Minister of Australia and one of the founding fathers of Australian Federation.

Its main campuses are in Melbourne&#x27;s Burwood suburb, Geelong Waurn Ponds, Geelong Waterfront, and Warrnambool. Deakin also has a learning centre in Werribee.

 Deakin University is ranked among the top 1% of universities in the world, is the 3rd-highest-ranked university in the world for Sport Science, is one of the top 29 universities in the world for Nursing, is one of the top 32 universities in the world for Education, and is among fewer than 5% of Business Schools worldwide with Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business accreditation.

Deakin University consistently ranks highly in undergraduate student satisfaction; in the 2019 Student Experience Survey, Deakin had the fourth-highest student satisfaction rating nationally, the highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian public universities, and the highest student satisfaction rating out of all Victorian universities. Deakin has had the highest undergraduate student satisfaction ratings out of all Victorian universities every year since 2010 and has consistently placed in the top two for highest postgraduate student satisfaction out of all Victorian universities every year since 2010.

==History==
Deakin University was formally established in 1974 with the passage of the &quot;Deakin University Act 1974&quot;. Deakin was Victoria&#x27;s fourth university, the first to be established in regional Victoria and the first to specialise in distance education.

Deakin University&#x27;s first campus was established at Waurn Ponds. The university was the result of a merger between State College of Victoria, Geelong (formerly Geelong Teachers College), and the higher education courses of the Gordon Institute of Technology. Deakin enrolled its first students at Waurn Ponds in 1977.

The Burwood campus is on the site of the former Burwood Teachers&#x27; College, and also takes in the former sites of the Bennettswood Primary School and the Burwood Secondary School. The teachers&#x27; college conducted two-year training courses for Primary School teachers, and three year courses for Infant Teachers (females only). It provided live-on-site accommodation for country students.

As part of the Dawkins education reforms that were announced in 1988 by the Commonwealth government, a merger with Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education took place in 1990, which was followed by a merger with most of Victoria College in 1991, with its campuses in Burwood, Rusden and Toorak.

The Rusden Campus was closed in 2003 and all courses were transferred to the Melbourne Burwood campus. Rusden was subsequently acquired by Monash University for its student accommodation purposes.

The former Toorak Campus, located in Malvern, was offered for sale in 2006 as the university considered the campus surplus to its requirements. The courses and resources were relocated to the Melbourne Burwood campus in November 2007. As a Deakin campus, it was home to the Deakin Business School, Deakin University English Language Institute (DUELI), and the Melbourne Institute of Business and Technology, which have since relocated to the International Centre and Business Building at the Melbourne Burwood campus.

The main building on the site was the 116-year-old Stonnington Mansion The sale of Stonnington Mansion by Deakin provoked public outrage as it involved the mansion which was at risk of redevelopment by property developers. The Stonnington Stables art gallery and the university&#x27;s contemporary art collection were located here, but has since relocated to the Deakin University Art Gallery at the Melbourne Burwood campus. The Deakin University Art Gallery has a wide collection of work by Australian artists including the Sydney based artist Rox De Luca. The university&#x27;s action of offering the campus, including the mansion, provoked public outrage over the potential privatization of what had been public space. In December 2006, the three-mansion was sold for $33 million to a joint venture between Hamton Property Group and Industry Superannuation Property Trust.

The northern alligator lizard was formerly known by the scientific name of &quot;Gerrhonotus coeruleus&quot; , but more recently has been assigned to the genus &quot;Elgaria&quot;.

==Subspecies==
Four subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;E. c. coerulea&quot; – San Francisco alligator lizard
*&quot;E. c. palmeri&quot; – Sierra alligator lizard
*&quot;E. c. principis&quot; – Northwestern alligator lizard
*&quot;E. c. shastensis&quot; – Shasta alligator lizard

A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Elgaria&quot;.

The subspecies &quot;E. c. principis&quot; is one of seven species of lizards in Canada.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;palmeri&quot;, is in honor of American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer.

==Description==
The northern alligator lizard is a medium-sized slender lizard. Adults reach a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about and a total length (including tail) of roughly . It has a distinct skin fold on each side, separating the keeled scales on the back from the smooth ventral scales. The skin varies in color, but can be brown and white, or greenish yellow and brown. Dorsally, &quot;E. coerulea&quot; is brownish in color and often has dark blotches that sometimes blend together into bands. The throat and mouth area of some young individuals can be yellow. The belly is light gray. The eyes are dark.

==Diet==
The typical diet of &quot;E. coerulea&quot; includes crickets, slugs, beetles, spiders, and moths, but it will also take larger prey, such as small lizards, and will even eat small baby mice if given the opportunity.

==Reproduction==
The northern alligator lizard is live-bearing, producing up to 15 young (typically 4–5), between June and September. During the spring breeding season, a male lizard grasps the head of a female with his mouth until she is ready to let him mate with her. They can remain attached this way for many hours, almost oblivious to their surroundings. Besides keeping her from running off to mate with another male, this probably shows her how strong and suitable a mate he is.

==Distribution==

The northern alligator lizard occurs along the Pacific Coast and in the Rocky Mountains from southern British Columbia through Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana south through Oregon to the coastal range and the Sierra Nevada in central California. As the map shows, the different subspecies have quite different geographic ranges, with &quot;E. c. principis&quot; being the most widely distributed, whereas &quot;E. c. coerulea&quot; occurs mainly around the San Francisco area but is also found farther north into Humboldt County.

The species is widely distributed along the Pacific coast and can be found from sea level up to elevation of about . It is found in a variety of forested habitats and montane chaparral.

As winter sets in, colder temperatures force northern alligator lizards to undergo brumation. Brumation allows them to reduce caloric usage and retain body heat during winter. Often, western alligator lizards choose to hide under rocks—though logs and burrows are occasionally used—to undergo this process.

<text>Compstall is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England, between Marple Bridge and Romiley. Historically part of Cheshire, it was formerly a mill village built by George Andrew in the 1820s to house his 800 workers; most of the original mill cottages and other structures remain unchanged.

The waterways were constructed to carry water from the weir, on the River Etherow, to turn the mill wheels. A water wheel called &quot;Big Lily&quot; was the largest in England when it was built in 1839. The former millpond forms part of Etherow Country Park, one of the oldest country parks in England.

==History==

Compstall was first noted as a place where farmers would meet to trade and sell their sheep, which were held at Barlow Fold, Greave Fold, Ratcliffe Fold, Beacom Fold and Lower Fold. The &quot;Touch Stone&quot; in the market place marks where deals were made; it is a glacial erratic deposited during the last ice age. Once a deal was agreed, the parties would spit on their hands and hit the stone, sealing the deal.

In 1804, the Andrew family established a water-driven calico printing business downstream from the present mill site. In 1821, Thomas Andrew died; the Manchester Guardian of 22 September recorded &quot;On Friday morning the 14th inst. suddenly of angina pectoris, under which he had laboured for some years, Thomas Andrew, Esq, of Harpurhey aged 68. He has left a widow and numerous family to lament his loss.&quot; His son, George Andrew I, reorganised the business. He built a water-powered cotton mill and a reservoir to power the wheels; he had a steam engine to provide backup power. The earliest workers&#x27; cottages had been built in the southern side of the bridge in 1806; in 1823, cottages were built along Market Street on the north side and this became the heart of the village. With further mills, further houses were added to the north of the village and, by 1839, the village was almost complete.

A Co-op store was opened in 1851 and further shops followed. The first church was the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. The Andrews family built the multipurpose Athenaeum in 1865. St Paul&#x27;s Church of England church was built in the Early English style.

Steam and gas lighting were installed in the mill by 1890 and these were replaced by electricity in 1915.

==Compstall Mills==

George Andrew experimented with printing; then, on the death of his father, started on the mill complex on the site known today. Between 1833 and 1833, he built Old Mill, a five-storey L-shaped building that fronted on the river and on Market Street. At its north end, there was a four-storey building that housed the water wheel. During the six years from 1833 to 1839, the Scotland Mill, the Victoria Mill, Provans Mill and Noah&#x27;s Ark weaving sheds were built. The first two water wheels, Old Josh and North Wheel, were supplemented by the giant Lily Wheel in 1838; this was wide and in diameter and was built by Fairburn and Lillie.

The North Mill was added between 1839 and 1847 and the mill office was extended. The Albert Mill and a range of riverside buildings, including the mechanics shop, were extended between 1847 and 1872. Over the next 25 years, many extra weaving sheds were added and extended. By 1907, a new engine house had been added.

===Future developments===
After a long period of consultation, planning permission was sought in July 2009 to restore and redevelop the site. It was proposed that there should be 121 residential units and of commercial space. The Victoria and Albert Mills would be refurbished to create 58 apartments. The Engine House would be restored and house the existing electricity sub-station and provide industrial space. The boiler house, with its traces of the Lily Wheel pit, would be restored and be used as commercial space. The Scotland Mill would be demolished and replaced with the New Scotland Mill with 32 two-bedroom duplex apartments overlooking the Country Park. The building would mirror the length, height and form of the original mill, using complementary materials. New 3- and 4-bedroom terraced family houses would be built along the north bank of the river where the mechanic shop once stood. A new clubhouse for Etherow Country Park Sailing Club would be built on or near the site of the now demolished Noah&#x27;s Ark shed.

As with any scheme, there would be landscaping, the site would be tidied, parking provided and public open spaces constructed.

==Other landmarks==
Compstall Hall was built by George Andrew in 1825 in the Grecian Villa style, with an imposing driveway and entrance. It was owned by James Walton during the 1850s.

Compstall Bridge is a Grade II listed building and carries the B6104 road over the River Etherow.

==Etherow Country Park==

Etherow Country Park was established in 1968; covering 240 acres, it is one of the oldest country parks in England and one of the most widely visited in Stockport. The park includes several millponds and other industrial relics alongside the River Etherow.

The Goyt Way starts in the park, running for a distance of through Compstall, Marple and New Mills to Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Compstall, at metropolitan borough level: Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester.

===Administrative history===
Compstall was historically part of the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. Stockport parish was subdivided into townships; the western of part Compstall village was in the Romiley township, but the main part of the village to the east was in the Werneth township (not to be confused with the other Werneth, to the north in Oldham). The River Etherow formed the county boundary with Derbyshire; the area south of the river was in the Ludworth township of Glossop.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Romiley and Werneth each became civil parishes.

From 1877, the part of Werneth north of the hill of Werneth Low, which area included the village of Gee Cross, was included in the local government district of Hyde, which became a municipal borough in 1881. From 1880, Romiley parish was included in the Bredbury and Romiley local government district.

The Local Government Act 1894 said that civil parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so Werneth was reduced to just cover the area outside the borough of Hyde. Compstall was thereafter the largest settlement in the parish, and so in 1897 the civil parish of Werneth was formally renamed Compstall.

In 1902, Compstall parish was made an urban district. It was relatively small for an urban district; it had a population of just 865 in 1931 (the last census before it was abolished). The parish and urban district of Compstall were abolished in 1936. Most of the area, including the village, became part of Bredbury and Romiley Urban District, and a smaller area was transferred to the borough of Hyde. Also in 1936, Ludworth was transferred from Derbyshire to Cheshire and incorporated into Marple. Bredbury and Romiley Urban District was abolished in 1974 and its area became part of the metropolitan borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester.

==Transport==
===Buses===
There are regular bus services on a circular route to and from Stockport town centre: the 383 travels anticlockwise to Romiley, Bredbury and Portwood; and the 384 clockwise to Marple Bridge, Marple and Offerton.

===Railway===
Compstall does not have its own railway station; the nearest is over a mile away at . It is a stop on the Hope Valley Line between , and . Services are generally half-hourly on Mondays to Saturdays, hourly on Sundays.

<doc id="619904" wikidata="Q378720" url="?curid=619904" title="Great West Conference">
<text>The Great West Conference (GWC) was an NCAA college athletic conference in the continental United States. Originally a football-only league, it became an all-sports entity during the 2008–09 season. The GWC stopped sponsoring football following the 2011 season. The conference became defunct when four of the remaining five full member schools became members of other conferences on July 1, 2013.

==History==
Cal Poly, North Dakota State, Northern Colorado, South Dakota State, Southern Utah, and UC Davis inaugurated the Great West Football Conference during the 2004 season. Cal Poly and UC Davis had previously been members of the American West Conference, a similar low-level conference that existed in the 1990s. St. Mary&#x27;s (CA) was originally slated to join as well, but then dropped the sport six months before the league started play. In 2005, Cal Poly became the first GWFC team ever selected to participate in the NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS) playoffs.

Northern Colorado departed the Great West for the Big Sky Conference in every sport as of the 2006 football season and 2006–07 academic year. On March 7, 2007, North Dakota State and South Dakota State announced that they would leave the GWFC after the 2007 football season, and join the Gateway Football Conference as of 2008. By the time the two schools actually made the switch, the Gateway had renamed itself the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The duo also placed their other sports, which were then independent, in the Summit League as of the 2008–09 academic year.

On August 2, 2007, North Dakota and South Dakota announced that they would join the Great West Football Conference as of the 2008 season. This agreement allowed the total number of GWFC programs to remain consistent at five, while also retaining the same geographic footprint.

On July 10, 2008, it was made official through a series of press conferences that the Great West would soon transition from a football-only league into an all-sports conference. The charter members included North Dakota, South Dakota, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Houston Baptist, Texas-Pan American, and Utah Valley. On October 22, 2008, Chicago State announced plans to join the newly rechristened GWC as well. Seattle was initially considering membership, but in mid-2011 accepted an invitation to instead join the WAC as of the 2012–13 academic year.

The expanded version of the Great West officially began playing a limited number of sports in the fall of 2008. Despite not sponsoring conference schedules in team sports (except football), the league began awarding &quot;Player of the Week&quot; honors to student-athletes in every sport during the 2008–09 season. The Great West featured championships in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, and women&#x27;s tennis during the 2008–09 academic year. In 2009–10, regular season schedules and championship tournaments were implemented in women&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, and softball.

Due to its newness, the league did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, but the Great West Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament champion received an automatic bid to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT), while the women&#x27;s basketball tournament winners went to the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational (WBI).

In April 2010, South Dakota publicized intentions to join the Summit League for all sports but football, effective as of the 2011–12 academic year. Seven months later, in November 2010, the school would announce a commitment to the MVFC for football as of the 2012 season. In September 2010, Cal Poly and UC Davis announced that they would join the Big Sky Conference for football by 2012. Then, in November 2010, Southern Utah and North Dakota announced that they would join the Big Sky for all sports by 2012. South Dakota was considering the Big Sky as well, thus canceling the Summit League commitment, before the MVFC offered football-only membership.

With these moves, all football programs would soon leave the Great West, and the league stopped sponsoring the sport following the 2011 season. South Dakota stepped down to football-only status during the 2011–12 academic year, allowing the league to retain five teams in its final season on the gridiron. Overall the conference lost two full members—South Dakota and North Dakota—and six affiliates by the fall of 2012. The affiliate teams were Cal Poly, UC Davis, and Southern Utah in football; Nebraska-Omaha in softball; as well as multi-sport partners Cal State Bakersfield and Seattle.

In November 2011, Houston Baptist reached an agreement to join the Southland Conference as of the 2013–14 academic year. The school also unveiled plans to begin sponsoring football. In September 2012, Utah Valley announced plans to join the Western Athletic Conference for the 2013–14 season. At the beginning of December 2012, Texas–Pan American announced they had received an invitation to join the WAC for 2013–14 school year. On December 5, 2012, Chicago State announced that it would also join the WAC in 2013–14, and two weeks later, Texas–Pan American accepted their invitation. These departures led to the end of the Great West. NJIT, which became an independent after the demise of the Great West, joined the Atlantic Sun Conference on June 11, 2015.

In 2010, the Great West Conference sponsored men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball championship tournaments for the first time. Both events were held in Orem, Utah, at the UCCU Center, home of Utah Valley University. The top-seeded men from the South Dakota reaffirmed their regular season success with a 91–86 title game victory over runner-up Houston Baptist. On the women&#x27;s side, Utah Valley took advantage of the crowd&#x27;s support, as the number six seeds upset their way to the crown by wrapping up the stunning run with a 70–62 triumph over regular season winners North Dakota.

The Great West tournaments returned to the UCCU Center for an encore in 2011, and third-seeded North Dakota claimed the men&#x27;s championship after a 77–76 double overtime thriller against South Dakota, which was seeded fourth. Regular season winners Chicago State remained true to form in the women&#x27;s bracket, outlasting third seeds North Dakota by a score of 74–66.

In 2012, the Great West tournaments shifted to the Emil and Patricia Jones Convocation Center at Chicago State University. North Dakota became the league&#x27;s first back-to-back champs, as the second seeds enjoyed a 75–60 victory over fourth-seeded NJIT in the men&#x27;s final. The weekend would end with a clean sweep for North Dakota, as the program&#x27;s top-seeded women knocked off regular season runners-up Utah Valley 69–56 to claim their maiden league title.

The Great West Conference never had an automatic bid to the NCAA Men or Women&#x27;s College Tournament, but the men&#x27;s champions did receive automatic selection to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, while their female counterparts headed to the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational.

==Baseball champions==
The Great West Conference sponsored its inaugural baseball championship tournament in 2010, and held the event in different cities during each of its four years of existence. The league also experimented with formats, using pool play in 2010 but a traditional double elimination bracket from 2011 to 2013. Utah Valley claimed the first three regular season and tournament championships, while Northern Colorado and Houston Baptist won the final regular season and tournament championships, respectively. As in other sports, the Great West did not have an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship and no teams within the league earned an at-large invitation.

==Other champions==
In addition to formerly sponsoring football; while continuing to sponsor men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, and baseball; the Great West Conference sponsored many other sports. The GWC held its own men&#x27;s golf championship in 2009, but the league&#x27;s members decided to compete under the banner of the older and larger America Sky Men&#x27;s Golf Conference starting in 2010, even though the option existed to hold a smaller Great West tournament and then participate in the America Sky event as well. Making men&#x27;s tennis a league sport was also under discussion, but it never happened because only three schools—Chicago State, NJIT, and Texas Pan-American—had teams as of the 2012 season. The America Sky continued in operation during the 2014 season. That conference was absorbed by the Big Sky Conference in July 2014 once the latter added Idaho as its sixth golf-sponsoring school; the two remaining non-Big Sky members of the America Sky then became Big Sky golf affiliates.

==Facilities==
Each full member of the Great West Conference has an on-campus basketball arena. Seating capacities range between 1,500 and 8,500. The full members are joined by three affiliates in baseball, forming an eight-team league. In women&#x27;s soccer, the presence of three affiliates helped create a six-team league.

Softball previously had four members, with Nebraska-Omaha replacing South Dakota for the 2012 season, but North Dakota and Nebraska-Omaha departed at the conclusion of that campaign. This leaves just Houston Baptist and Utah Valley, with no future alignment announced as of August 2012.

<text>Arena football is a variety of gridiron football designed to be played indoors. The game is played on a smaller field than American or Canadian football, designed to fit in the same surface area as a standard North American ice hockey rink, and features between six and eight players for each team playing at any given time depending on the league, resulting in a faster and higher-scoring game that can be played on the floors of indoor arenas. The sport was invented in 1981, and patented in 1987, by Jim Foster, a former executive of the National Football League and the United States Football League. The name is trademarked by Gridiron Enterprises and had a proprietary format until its patent expired in 2007.

Three leagues have played under official arena football rules: the Arena Football League, which played 32 seasons in two separate runs from 1987 to 2008 and 2010 to 2019; arenafootball2, the AFL&#x27;s erstwhile developmental league, which played 10 seasons from 2000 through 2009; and the China Arena Football League, which played two abbreviated seasons in 2016 and 2019 but was not directly affiliated with the now-defunct AFL. A 2024 reboot of the Arena Football League uses the original league&#x27;s rulebook with minor variations.

Through the late 1990s, the Arena Football League was the only league playing any variant of the sport designed for indoor play. A clarification limiting the scope of its patent allowed for competing indoor football leagues (sometimes known as arena leagues) to use the same size field and most other aspects of the game. Arena football is distinguished from the other indoor leagues by its use of large rebound nets attached to the side of each goalpost, which keep any missed field goal or overthrown ball in the field of play and allow the ball to remain live; the rebound nets were the only part of the patent that was upheld until it expired. As a result, some non-AFL arena leagues that formed after the patent expired like the National Arena League have used rebound nets, although they no longer do. Other leagues such as the Indoor Football League and American Indoor Football opt to not use them. The newest league, Arena Football One, will use the rebound nets as they begin play in 2025.

==History==
===Early history===
The first demonstration of football on a small field was actually played outdoors at the original open-air Madison Square Garden. Using nine-man sides, Pennsylvania defeated Rutgers 10–0 at the annual meeting of the Amateur Athletic Union on January 16, 1889. Two months later, on March 7, 1889, the first documented indoor football game was an exhibition between Pennsylvania and Riverton Club at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. Field dimensions for the 0-0 tie were no more than 200 feet long by 50 feet wide, and the exhibition was played at night under gas lamps.

Other early indoor games included two exhibitions at Madison Square Garden II in December 1890. Springfield YMCA Training School and a Yale Senior Class team played on December 12, 1890. James Naismith scored a touchdown for Springfield, though Yale won the exhibition 16–10. The following day a second exhibition game was played, with Pennsylvania defeating Rutgers 20–12. The field at Madison Square Garden measured long and wide. In an exhibition at Tattersall&#x27;s Pavilion in Chicago on December 16, 1893, Chicago defeated Northwestern 20-14 on a field smaller than regulation.

The first documented indoor regulation football games were those played at the Chicago Coliseum in the late 1890s. The first such game matched Michigan against Chicago on Thanksgiving Day 1896. The match was &quot;the first collegiate game of football played under a roof.&quot; Adding to the novelty, as daylight turned to darkness, the field inside the Coliseum was lit with electric lighting. With seven acres of floor space, the sprawling Coliseum is believed to have not needed any compromises to accommodate an American football field. According to a newspaper account, the field grew dark in the second half, and play was halted for ten minutes to discuss whether play should continue. Play was resumed, and the lights were finally turned on after Michigan scored a touchdown. The press proclaimed the experiment in indoor football to be a success:

One thing at least was settled by the game, and that is, that indoor football is literally and figuratively speaking a howling success. The men had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind. Toward the end of the second half it got very dark, and the spectators were treated to a novelty in the shape of football by electric light.&quot;

Although both critically and commercially successful, the Coliseum was destroyed in a fire less than two years after its opening. It hosted only four games, and its replacement could not accommodate an American football field.

Later, at Madison Square Garden in 1902 and 1903, there were games known as the &quot;World Series of Pro Football.&quot; The games were played on a 70-yard by 35-yard dirt field but otherwise adhered to outdoor rules. Poor attendance led to the tournament being discontinued after two years.

The Chicago Bears of the National Football League hosted an experimental game against their crosstown rivals, the Cardinals, after the 1930 NFL season, at the indoor Chicago Stadium. Two years later, poor weather conditions led to the Bears hosting the 1932 NFL Playoff Game against the Portsmouth Spartans (now the Detroit Lions) at the stadium. A dirt and tanbark field measuring 80 yards long (60 yards plus two ten-yard end zones) and 45 yards wide was constructed on the arena&#x27;s floor. The Chicago Stadium games were notable for introducing several rule changes, including the introduction of hash marks to keep play away from spectators who were seated next to the field (much like modern indoor football), while goal posts were moved to the goal line. To compensate for the smaller field, teams were &quot;penalized&quot; 20 yards upon crossing midfield. (The Bears&#x27; official Web site goes further and claims that field goals were outlawed for the 1932 game.)

In 1930, the Atlantic City Convention Center constructed a nearly full-size indoor football field, and used it for one to three games a year during the 1930s; the stadium stopped hosting games in 1940 and did not resume hosting football games until 1961. In the 1960s, the Boardwalk Bowl, a post-season game involving small college teams, was contested at the convention center. The Bowl was an attempt to make Atlantic City more of a year-round resort in the pre-gambling era as opposed to a single-season one (the Miss America Pageant, also held at the center, likewise began as an attempt to extend the season beyond Labor Day). The Atlantic Coast Football League played its inaugural championship game at the convention center in 1962, but the game only drew 2,000 fans and the game would thereafter move to the home stadium of the team with the best regular season record. The Philadelphia-based Liberty Bowl game, which had been played at Municipal Stadium from 1959 to 1963, was moved into the Convention Center in 1964 for the contest between Utah and West Virginia. The game drew just over 6,000 fans, though, and the Liberty Bowl moved to Memphis the next year, where it has remained. Unlike modern indoor football, the size of the playing surface and hence the rules were essentially the same as in the standard outdoor game, with rules updated to deal with contingencies for what could happen indoors, such as a punt striking the ceiling. The end zones were slightly shorter—eight yards instead of the standard ten (coincidentally, the eight-yard endzone length is the standard in modern indoor football).

===Arena Football League===
While several attempts to create a true indoor football game have been made since shortly after American football was developed, the first version to meet with relatively widespread success and acceptance was devised by Jim Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. He devised his game while watching indoor soccer, another game derived from a sport played outdoors. He worked on the game in the early 1980s, but put any plans for full development of it on hold while the United States Football League, an attempt to play traditional American football in a non-traditional (spring-summer) season, was in operation in 1983–1985. When the USFL ceased operations, Foster saw his opportunity. He staged a &quot;test&quot; game in Rockford, Illinois in 1986 and put together a four-team league for a &quot;demonstration season&quot; in the spring of 1987, with games televised on ESPN.

Foster had to adopt a field that would fit within the smaller playing surfaces found in most arenas and thus created a field that was identical in size to a standard North American ice hockey rink, . This resulted in the field being 50 yards long (half of the length of a standard American football field) with eight-yard end zones (which may, if necessary, be curved in the end zones as hockey rinks are), and the field being slightly over half as wide as a standard football field. Foster adopted short-pile artificial turfs (which were then standard) such as AstroTurf for the field because of its ability to be easily rolled up when the arena is being used for other sports.

Foster adopted a modified version of eight-man football. He also mandated a one-platoon system that required at least six players to play on both offensive and defensive downs. This had the added desirable effect of limiting team payrolls.

There were numerous other rules designed to help the offense and ensure high-scoring games:
*punting is banned; a team not likely to get a first down may only attempt a field goal.
*the placing of taut rebound nets at the ends of the playing surface alongside the goalposts. Kicked and passed balls bouncing off these nets remain in play. In the case of a pass, the ball is live only until it touches the ground, allowing for receptions and interceptions on the rebound. On an unsuccessful field goal attempt or kickoff, the ball remains in play unless it goes out of bounds or until the player recovering it is downed by contact or scores, so on kicking plays (except an extra point attempt) either team may attempt to gain possession of the ball and advance it, much as a blocked kick could be in the traditional outdoor game. Only kicked or passed balls touching the slack nets behind the goalposts are ruled dead at that point.

To further an offensive passing advantage over the defense, Foster also imposed strict restrictions on the defensive formation, mandating that all defenses were required to play a 3-2-Monster formation with three defensive linemen, two linebackers, two cornerbacks, and one safety. Linebackers were not permitted to blitz and were required to stay in boxes behind the line of scrimmage, while defensive linemen were hindered by restrictions that prevented them from using certain techniques to penetrate the offensive line. Quarterbacks and placekickers were exempt from the one-platoon system, allowing two key scoring positions to be more specialized. The AFL also adopted the USFL&#x27;s concept of playing in the late spring and summer, since this is when most hockey and basketball arenas have the fewest schedule conflicts (only competing with touring stadium rock concerts). The spring schedule has since been adopted by virtually all other professional indoor leagues as of 2010.

Within a year of the AFL kicking off, its first challenger, the World Indoor Football League formed. The WIFL planned to play a schedule with six teams beginning in summer of 1988 with its own set of indoor-inspired rules, including an unusual system that would have eight men on offense and seven men on defense. Despite having backing from former NFL players, veteran coaches, and singer John Mellencamp, the league canceled its 1988 season, folded half of its franchises (including Mellencamp&#x27;s), and made an unsuccessful bid for the remaining three teams to join the AFL; the WIFL never played a single game.

In 1990, Foster patented the rules of arena football, meaning that only persons authorized by him could use his rules and his name for the sport. While the AFL asserted throughout the 1990s that the patent covered virtually every aspect of the game (from the 50-yard field to the eight-man format), a 1998 lawsuit (&quot;Arena Football League v. Professional Indoor Football League&quot;) established that the patent specifically covered the rebound net feature, meaning that competitors could not use this aspect of the rules. However, under provisions of U.S. patent law, Foster&#x27;s patent expired on March 27, 2007, enabling competitors to use rebound nets (at least as originally envisioned, without other innovations that he may have patented).

The AFL signed a major network television broadcasting contract with NBC, and eventually launched an official minor league, af2, beginning in 2000. This effort basically served two purposes: one as a developmental league for the AFL, and as a place where former collegiate players could develop while at the same time learning and becoming accustomed to the unique arena rules, and secondly as a pre-emptive way of shutting out potential new indoor football competitors (this was especially important as the 2007 expiration of Foster&#x27;s patent on the rebound nets approached). At times over forty teams participated in this league, almost uniformly in cities which also had minor league ice hockey teams and hence suitable arenas.

Shortly before the end of 2008, the Arena Football League announced that it would not be playing a 2009 spring season. During the previous few years, the league administrators and team owners had allowed player salaries and other costs to rise to the point where the league and many of the teams were losing a substantial amount of money. Late in the summer of 2009, with the team owners unable to agree on a plan for making the league viable again the AFL announced that it was folding, eventually putting its assets up in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

The developmental af2, however, played its 2009 season as scheduled. Most of the teams made a sustainable profit and the team owners were eager to see the league continue for another year. However, with the AFL owning 50.1% of the af2, it would fold if the AFL folded. At the end of the 2009 season, a gathering of af2 and remaining AFL team owners set out to form their own organization, originally known as Arena Football 1 (AF1). AF1 went on to purchase all assets of the original AFL and af2, except for a few team names and logos owned by outside parties, in a December 2009 bankruptcy auction. Shortly after the purchase, AF1 adopted the Arena Football League name, and the AFL relaunched in 2010. The &quot;iron man&quot; rule, requiring at least six of the eight players to play on both offense and defense, was dropped, but most other past AFL rules remained unchanged. The relaunched league saw franchises return and renewed interest, but by the end of the 2017 season, almost all of the league&#x27;s teams had either folded or moved to other leagues, with only the Philadelphia Soul having existed prior to 2016. Five expansion teams, all in the Mid-Atlantic United States, were established over the next two years, before the league announced after the 2019 season that it was dissolving in a second Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

However, on February 1, 2023, a new ownership group that had acquired the league&#x27;s trademarks and social media accounts announced another revival of the league, which began play in 2024.

On May 12, 2024, kicker Melissa Strother made an extra point while playing for the Washington Wolfpack, making her the first female player to score a point in the league.
===Other indoor leagues===

Other indoor football leagues have been formed, without the use of the rebound nets at the ends of the field. Like the AFL, their playing seasons are entirely or primarily outside the traditional fall/early winter season of the outdoor sport so as not to be competing with it directly for fan support.

Since the first such league, the Professional Indoor Football League, began play in the 1998, there has often been a pattern of instability. Each off-season has seen teams jumping from league to league. In addition, leagues have annually merged, changed names, and separated. The organization that is most recently known as American Indoor Football (AIF) went through three names and two ownership changes in its first three seasons. Several other indoor leagues have been announced without ever actually commencing play, or operating only briefly with a handful of teams. Some were claimed attempts to form a second &quot;major&quot; league of indoor football while others were strictly efforts to form a new &quot;minor&quot; league.

A few leagues have achieved a certain level of stability, however. The National Indoor Football League (NIFL) began in 2001 and was the most successful league in the early 2000s. The Indoor Football League (IFL) began in the autumn of 2008 when two already-established leagues (the Intense Football League and United Indoor Football) chose to merge into a single organization. The IFL&#x27;s expansion model has been based less on establishing new teams and more on acquiring existing teams from other leagues. The IFL has 16 teams as of 2024. Other, regional leagues include Champions Indoor Football (CIF), the American Arena League (AAL) and National Arena League (NAL). Both CIF and the AAL were formed by mergers of existing leagues. The CIF was formed from a merger of the Champions Professional Indoor Football League and the Lone Star Football League in 2015. The AAL was formed in late 2017 as the combination of three leagues that each played one season: the Can-Am Indoor Football League, Arena Pro Football, and Supreme Indoor Football. Champions Indoor Football merged with the new Arena Football League prior to 2024.

Fan Controlled Football launched in 2021 following an interactive format inspired by video games, with &quot;power-ups&quot; and fans voting on plays. It generally targeted a higher caliber of player than the typical indoor league, with outdoor football veterans such as Johnny Manziel, Robert Turbin, Quinton Flowers, Quinn Porter, Shawn Oakman and Josh Gordon playing in the league&#x27;s inaugural season, and Terrell Owens joining the following year (Michael Vick was also announced as a player midseason but would not play). FCF suspended operations following the 2022 season.

The best-known indoor women&#x27;s football league is the X League (formerly known as the Legends Football League, and Lingerie Football League ). Known for its scantily-clad players and its signature event, the X cup (formerly Legends Cup and Lingerie Bowl), the LFL played a variant of indoor rules with most of its games in indoor stadiums, although a few teams experimented with playing in outdoor stadiums. The league&#x27;s brief foray into Australia was played in outdoor stadiums; these teams nevertheless played under indoor football rules. All other women&#x27;s leagues play on outdoor fields with outdoor rules; there have been several other attempts to form indoor women&#x27;s football leagues, but none have made it to play.

==Arena Football rules==

===The field===
As its name implies, arena football is played exclusively indoors, in arenas usually designed for either basketball or ice hockey teams. The field is the same width and length as a standard NHL hockey rink, making it approximately 30% of the dimensions of a regular American gridiron football field, and 19% of a Canadian gridiron football field (the total playing area, including the end zones of an Arena football field is ). The scrimmage area is long (unlike the field in NFL which is long), and each end zone is approximately 8 yards deep, two yards less than the standard 10 yards. Depending on the venue in which a game is being played, the end zones may be rectangular (like a basketball court) or, where necessary because of the building design, rounded (like a hockey rink; this is much like some Canadian football fields where the end zones can be cut off by a track). Each sideline has a heavily padded barrier, with the padding placed over the hockey dasher boards.

The goalpost uprights are wide, and the crossbar is above the playing surface. Taut rebound nets on either side of the posts bounce any missed field goals back into the field of play. The ball is &quot;live&quot; when rebounding off these nets or their support apparatus. The entire goalframe and goalside rebound net system is suspended on cables from the rafters. The bottom of the two goalside rebound nets are off the playing surface. Each netframe is high by wide.

A player is not counted as out of bounds on the sidelines unless he is pushed into or falls over the sideline barrier. This rule was put in place before the 2006 season. Before that time, a sideline with only a small amount of space (typically 6&quot; to 12&quot;) existed between the sideline stripe and the barrier which would provide the space for a ball carrier to step out of bounds before hitting the sideline barrier.

===The players===
Each team fields 8 players at a time from a 21-man active roster. Before 2007, players played both offense and defense except for the Quarterback, Kicker, and Offensive Specialist (Wide Receiver/Running Back combination) and two Defensive Specialists (Defensive Backs).

===Substitution rules===

====Rules before 2007 season====
If a player enters and leaves, from the moment he leaves the player is considered &quot;dead&quot; and cannot return to play until the designated time is served.
* For two-way players &quot;dead&quot; time is one quarter.
* For specialists &quot;dead&quot; time is one half.

Exception: a &quot;dead&quot; player may participate on kickoffs, or as long snapper or holder. In 2006, the AFL changed its substitution rules such that free substitutions were allowed on all kickoffs.

====New rules for 2007 season====
The most significant change was the introduction of free substitution, the so-called &quot;Elway Rule&quot;. Previously, AFL coaches were limited to one substitution per position per quarter. From to and come , coaches can substitute players at will.

The rationale was that free substitution would improve the overall quality of football in the league by giving coaches the freedom to put their best players on the field for every play of the game, and that teams would be able to select from a wider player talent pool when building their rosters. Traditionalists, however, believed the rule changes were the beginning of the removal of the &quot;ironman&quot; (two-way offense and defense) style of play of arena football that the league had actively promoted for 20 seasons, and that the change took away a key component of what made arena football a distinctive sport.

====New rules for 2024 season====
The iteration of the league that began play in 2024 restored the &quot;ironman&quot; rules at the beginning of the season. After the league reorganized, the league abandoned ironman play and restored free substitution; unlike in 2007, the reason for the 2024 change was in part to justify salary cuts that were required when a previous commissioner—Lee Hutton, who was ousted in the reorganization—made promises to cover higher salaries but had no revenue to fund such promises (since under ironman, a player would fill the roles of what would have otherwise been two roster spots, justifying their higher price compared to a one-way player in other indoor leagues).

===Formations===
Four offensive players must be on the line of scrimmage at the snap; one of the linemen must declare himself the tight end. One offensive player may be moving forward at the time of the snap as long as he has not yet crossed the line of scrimmage. Three defensive players must be in a three- or four-point stance at the start of the snap. Two defenders serve as linebackers, called the Mac and the Jack. The Mac may blitz from the side of the line opposite the offensive Tight End. The Jack&#x27;s role has changed after new rules set in place by the league in 2008. The Jack cannot blitz, but under new, more defense-friendly rules, the Jack Linebacker may roam sideline to sideline within five yards of the line of scrimmage and drop into coverage once the Quarterback pump fakes. (Before this rule, the Jack could not drop back into coverage until the ball is thrown or the quarterback is no longer in the pocket, and the Jack had to stay within the box designated by the outside shoulders of the offensive line, the line of scrimmage, and five yards back from the line of scrimmage.)

===Ball movement===
The ball is kicked off from the goal line, to start the halves and odd overtimes, or after any score. The team with the ball is given four downs to gain ten yards or score. Punting is illegal because of the size of the playing field, however, a field goal that either misses wide (therefore bouncing off the nets surrounding the goalposts) or falls short, may be returned. Thus an impossibly long field goal is tantamount to a punt in other football variants. A receiver jumping to catch a pass needs to get only one foot down in bounds for the catch to be ruled a completed catch, just as in college football. Practically, this means that one foot must touch the ground before the receiver is pushed into the boards by an opposing player. Passes that bounce off the rebound nets remain &quot;live.&quot; Balls that bounce off the padded walls that surround the field are &quot;live&quot;; the end zone walls were not live until the 2006 season. 

Come 2025 gunners must line up on their own 15-yard line on kickoffs, with one receiving player fielding from the end zone.

===Scoring===
The scoring is the same as in the NFL with the addition of a drop kick field goal worth four points during normal play or two points as a post-touchdown conversion. Blocked extra points and turnovers on two-point conversion attempts may be returned by the defensive team for two points.

Arena Football One intends to continue the added point for a drop kick, as well as bringing in the deuce from previous fifty-yard game variants.

The league also instituted the &quot;deuce&quot;: if a kickoff goes through the uprights, the kicking team receives two points. This rule had previously been in effect in the IFL and the NAL. The league also instituted the rouge / single, as used in the CFL, whereby, on a kickoff, the kicking team receives one point if the receiving team fails to bring the ball out of its own end zone.

After scoring a touchdown, the scoring team has the option of attempting a four-point conversion (akin to the three-point conversion seen in the UFL and its predecessors) from the opponent&#x27;s ten-yard line, alongside the existing extra point and two-point conversion options. The rule was carried over as part of a pre-launch merger with Champions Indoor Football. Teams may go for two points from the 2.5-yard line, three from the 5-yard line, or four from the 10-yard line after any touchdown, if they want to.

Any kickoff that goes through the uprights is scored as a &quot;deuce&quot;, or two points.

Arena Football One rescinded the three-point and four-point conversions along with the single from its rulebook in 2025, while keeping the deuce.

===Coaching challenges===
Coaches are given two challenges per game, as in the NFL; to challenge, they must throw their red flag before the next play. If the play stands as called after review, the challenging team loses a timeout. If a team wins both challenges used, a third is granted. Video review is automatic in the final half-minute of regulation, all overtime periods, and all scoring plays and turnovers.

===Timing===

====Current timing rules====
A game has four 15-minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime (ArenaBowl has a 30-minute interval). Teams are allowed three timeouts per half, and two per overtime period if regulation ends tied. Teams must use a timeout if there&#x27;s an injury inside a half-minute left in regulation or overtime; exception applies to when team has no timeouts, and this occurs, they&#x27;re granted an extra timeout.

The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays, incomplete passes, or sacks only in the last half-minute of regulation or overtime (there is only a half-minute warning, as opposed to the two-minute warning in the XFL/NFL and the three-minute warning in the CFL) or because of penalties, injuries or timeouts. The clock also stops for any change in possession, until the ball is marked ready for play; for example, aside from the final half-minute of regulation or overtime, time continues to run down after a touchdown, but stops after an extra point or two-point conversion attempt. If a quarter ends as a touchdown is scored, an untimed conversion attempt takes place. The play clock is 30 seconds, starting at the end of the previous play. In all arenas, the final minute of the period is measured in tenths of a second.

Prior to the 2018 season, during the final minute of the fourth quarter, the clock stopped if the offensive team had the lead and did not advance the ball past the line of scrimmage. This prevented the &quot;victory formation&quot; (the offensive team merely kneeling down), or running other plays that are designed solely to exhaust the remaining time rather than to advance the ball downfield. This rule was eliminated in the interest of player safety.

In the first overtime, each team gets one possession to score. Whoever is ahead after one possession wins. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, true sudden death rules apply thereafter. Each overtime period is 15 minutes, and continues from the ending of the previous overtime period until the tie is broken. All overtimes thereafter are true sudden death; no games can be tied. This includes both games of all semifinal series.

====Previous timing rule changes====
Before the 2007 season, there was one 15-minute overtime period, and if it expired with the teams still tied, the game was recorded as a tie. There were two ties in AFL history before the 2007 rule change:

* July 14, 1988: Chicago Bruisers 37, Los Angeles Cobras 37 (when this game was played, the overtime period was 7:30 long)
* April 8, 2005: Nashville Kats 41, Dallas Desperados 41

A July 25, 2015 game between the Las Vegas Outlaws and New Orleans VooDoo that was never played was also recorded as a scoreless tie.

Before 2007, the play clock was 25 seconds, and it began on the signal from the referee.

==Compensation==
All current indoor football teams play at a minor league or semi-professional level. The average player&#x27;s salary in the Arena Football League was US$1,800 per game in 2008; this is about one-quarter of the Canadian Football League (adjusted for inflation). Players in af2 were paid $250 per game and the AIFA and IFL had per-game salaries of $200 per game; the AFL paid $885 per game for most players in 2012, with that number rising to $940 per game in 2013 (although players then had to pay for their own housing, which the league previously provided); starting quarterbacks receive a $300 per game bonus. As of 2019, the IFL pays $200–$300 per game, with a $25 bonus for each win. FCF paid $400 to $750 a week. The 2024 revival of the AFL originally promised $1,000 per game, but this was soon rolled back to $250 per game (the salary of Champions Indoor Football in 2023) for most teams when the league reorganized.

==Connection to outdoor professional football==
Some AFL players have gone on to have successful careers in the National Football League, most notably Kurt Warner. Warner played college football at University of Northern Iowa and then quarterbacked the AFL&#x27;s Iowa Barnstormers to ArenaBowl X in 1996 and ArenaBowl XI in 1997, before earning two NFL MVP Awards, a Super Bowl MVP Award and quarterbacking the St. Louis Rams and the Arizona Cardinals to the Super Bowl, winning Super Bowl XXXIV with the Rams. Warner was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the only person to play a substantial portion of his professional career (as opposed to a short publicity stunt, as was the case with Joe DeLamielleure&#x27;s brief tenure in the sport) playing arena football.

Another, probably the second most notable behind Warner, could be Fred Jackson. Jackson played indoor football with the Sioux City Bandits in 2004 when they played in the NIFL (2004) and the UIF in 2005 before finally moving on to NFL Europa&#x27;s Rhein Fire in 2006, then to the NFL after Rhein.

Following an initial undistinguished NFL career, being released or unsigned for four seasons out of eight, quarterback Tommy Maddox would revitalize himself with the AFL&#x27;s New Jersey Red Dogs for one season before going on to quarterback the Los Angeles Xtreme to the XFL championship win and eventually return to the NFL for five seasons, retiring with a Super Bowl ring after the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowl XL.

Other AFL to NFL graduates include Anthony Armstrong, Oronde Gadsden, Lincoln Coleman, Adrian McPherson, Rashied Davis, Jay Feely, David Patten, Rob Bironas, Antonio Chatman, Mike Vanderjagt, and Paul Justin. Former Arena Football League MVP Jay Gruden (brother of Jon Gruden) went on to coach the Orlando Predators of the AFL, Florida Tuskers of the United Football League, and then the head coach for the Washington Redskins in the NFL. Eddie Brown, voted in 2006 as the greatest player in AFL history,[5][6] never played in the NFL, but his son Antonio Brown joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010 and was voted to the Pro Bowl in 2011 and in every season from 2013 to 2018. Matt Nagy was a quarterback in the AFL from 2002 to 2008 and became the head coach of the Chicago Bears in 2018.

Two players and one owner with substantial contributions (at least the majority of one season) have reached the Pro Football Hall of Fame: 2017 inductee Kurt Warner played the first three seasons of his professional career in the AFL, 2018 inductee Terrell Owens played his last professional season with the Indoor Football League in 2012, and the aforementioned Pat Bowlen was inducted into the Hall in 2019.

Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur was a quarterback for the Omaha Beef and the Billings Outlaws in the National Indoor Football League (NIFL). Running back Fred Jackson rushed for over 1,000 yards as the starting running back for the 2009 Buffalo Bills, and his high quality play earned him a spot on &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s &quot;All-Joe&quot; Team. Jackson played the early part of his professional football career for the Sioux City Bandits (now of Champions Indoor Football) and Michael Lewis played for the Louisiana Bayou Beast in 1999 and then with the New Orleans Saints.

The National Football League removed a ban that had been in place on any of its owners owning teams in any other sort of football operation with respect to Arena football only, and several of them had bought or started Arena teams at one point. However, the NFL allowed to lapse an option it had negotiated allowing it to purchase up to 49% of Arena football, and as of early 2007 seemed to have backed away from any plan it may have had to use Arena football as a developmental league in any sort of &quot;official&quot; sense, perhaps in the interest of not undermining its then-existing &quot;official&quot; developmental league, NFL Europa.

Several NFL owners owned Arena Football League teams in their own cities prior to the league&#x27;s bankruptcy. At the end of the 2008 season, Jerry Jones and the Dallas Desperados (who had similar colors and logos to the Dallas Cowboys), Arthur Blank&#x27;s Georgia Force, and the Colorado Crush (whose shareholders included Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and Rams then-minority owner Stan Kroenke) were still in the league. San Francisco 49ers owner Denise DeBartolo York and the Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder had future expansion rights to their respective cities. Tom Benson&#x27;s original New Orleans VooDoo and Bud Adams&#x27;s Nashville Kats had already folded prior to the bankruptcy and none of the NFL owners with AFL franchises returned to the league after its reformation in 2010, and most favored abolishing the league entirely.

Dozens of former and current professional outdoor football players also have invested money into indoor football franchises.

The IFL had a formal minor league partnership with the XFL in its 2023 season.

==Map of current teams==

==Other media==

Several arena football video games and trading card sets have been released. Upper Deck released AFL trading card sets in 2005 and 2006.

Even though arena football is a relatively young sport, it has appeared in various forms of popular culture over the course of its existence. In 2014, AMC aired the reality television series &quot;4th and Loud&quot;, following the first season of the LA Kiss and its owners, including Doc McGee and KISS bandmates Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons.

<doc id="619910" wikidata="Q594329" url="?curid=619910" title="Louie Anderson">
<text>Louis Perry Anderson (March 24, 1953 – January 21, 2022) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author and game show host. He created the cartoon series &quot;Life with Louie&quot; and the television sitcom &quot;The Louie Show&quot;, and wrote four books, including &quot;Hey Mom: Stories for My Mother, But You Can Read Them Too&quot;, which was published in 2018. Anderson was the third host of the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; from 1999 to 2002 — the first host in its third and current run.

For his performance on the FX comedy television series &quot;Baskets&quot;, Anderson received three consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series nominations and won once in 2016.

Anderson performed a stand-up show called &quot;Louie: Larger Than Life&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 2003 through 2012. The show originated at the Union Plaza hotel downtown, before moving to Excalibur, South Point, and Palace Station hotels.

== Early life ==
Anderson was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the son of Ora Zella (&quot;née&quot; Prouty; 1912–1990), a &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendant, and Louis William Anderson (1901–1980). His father was a trumpeter for singer Hoagy Carmichael. Anderson was the second youngest of 11 children in his family. In a 2016 interview on &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, Anderson revealed that his mother actually gave birth to 16 children, but five of them—the first baby and then two sets of twins—died at birth. Anderson described his father as an abusive alcoholic.

Anderson attended Johnson Senior High in Saint Paul.

== Career ==

Anderson made his television debut on January 13, 1984, on Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s &quot;Young Comedians Special&quot; on HBO.

=== 1980s ===
Louie made his first movie appearance alongside Dabney Coleman in the movie &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; as taxi driver #2 ( released July 13, 1984) a notably small role with one line. 
On November 20, 1984, Anderson made his network debut as a comedian on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In late 1985, Anderson was cast as Lou Appleton alongside Bronson Pinchot on the pilot episode of &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; for ABC (which was known in this early stage as &quot;The Greenhorn&quot;). When the show was picked up, Anderson was replaced by Mark Linn-Baker in the role of Appleton (whose first name was then changed from Lou to Larry) as the producers did not think the chemistry between Anderson and Pinchot was quite right. The show ran for eight seasons on ABC. Anderson had a small role in the singing-telegram scene in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, as well as appearing in a comedy special on Showtime.

Anderson also played a role in John Landis&#x27; film &quot;Coming to America&quot;, which starred Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, a role which he reprised in the 2021 sequel. Murphy requested Anderson be hired for &quot;Coming To America&quot; after producers wanted a white actor in the otherwise African-American cast; Murphy described his friend Anderson as &quot;the funniest white guy around&quot;. Anderson also starred in the 1988 camp comedy &quot;The Wrong Guys&quot;, based on a story by John Hughes.

In 1989, Anderson guest-starred on the first episode of The Muppets television segment of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In 1995, Anderson created and produced a Saturday-morning animated series for Fox called &quot;Life with Louie&quot;. The series was based on Anderson&#x27;s childhood with 10 siblings, a sweet-hearted mother and a loud, war-crazed father. It also detailed how he was picked on for his weight, and how he used comedy to deal with the teasing. The show was a 3-year hit on Fox, and won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program.

Anderson created and starred in &quot;The Louie Show&quot; for CBS. The show had Anderson playing a psychotherapist in Duluth, Minnesota. The show ran six episodes and was canceled.

Anderson was also the host of Comedy Showcase in the late 1990s.

Anderson landed the role of host of the new version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; in 1999. Anderson asked former &quot;Family Feud&quot; host Richard Dawson to appear on the premiere show to give him his blessing, but Dawson declined. Anderson organized a 9/11-themed tournament week of &quot;Family Feud&quot; between the FDNY and the NYPD, putting up $75,000 toward both organizations for recovery from the September 11, 2001, attacks. Anderson was let go from the show in 2002 and was replaced by Richard Karn.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Anderson appeared as a panelist on an episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; hosted by John O&#x27;Hurley, and in 2001, Anderson appeared on an episode of &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, winning $31,000. He made appearances on network television in &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (Then Sings My Soul, November 28, 1999), and &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. He guest starred on the Adult Swim cameo-filled show &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;.

Anderson played in the 2006 World Series of Poker Main Event in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Anderson was also in Joey TV series.

=== 2010s ===
Anderson filmed a standup special entitled &quot;Louie Anderson: Big Baby Boomer&quot;. In it, Anderson poked fun at his bad habits, pesky family members, and aging body.

In 2013, Anderson appeared in the ABC reality television series &quot;Splash&quot;. After practicing several dives into a swimming pool then nearly drowning, he needed help getting out from co-star football player Ndamukong Suh. Anderson signed on as the promotional spokesperson for his home state&#x27;s Land O&#x27;Lakes Sweet Cream butter brand. Anderson appeared in radio jingles, web ads, and television commercials promoting the product.

From 2016 to 2019, Anderson played the part of Christine Baskets on the FX comedy series &quot;Baskets&quot;. Anderson won the 2016 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance.

On July 23, 2017, Anderson competed on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; (hosted today by Steve Harvey); his opponent was singer/actress Christina Milian. This made him one of only a small number of individuals to have both hosted and been a contestant on the same game show, and also marked his first appearance on any form of &quot;Family Feud&quot; since his departure as host in 2002. Anderson was a regular panelist on the TV game show &quot;Funny You Should Ask&quot; from September 2017 until the show went on hiatus in 2020.

== Stand-up style ==
Dennis Miller called him &quot;one of the lightest on his feet comedians I know ... There&#x27;s very few guys I&#x27;m going to leave my dressing room early (to watch). ... (Louie has) a Fred Astaire, with a broken leg, approach. Very quick thinking, and he wouldn&#x27;t hammer points home, but he would do a &#x27;weave-back&#x27; that was almost &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;-like.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1984, Anderson married Diane Jean Vono; however, they divorced after four months. In 1985, Anderson married his high school sweetheart, Norma J. Walker. The marriage lasted only four weeks.

=== Blackmailing incident ===
In 1997, Anderson was blackmailed by Richard John Gordon, who threatened to tell tabloids that Anderson sexually propositioned him in a casino in 1993. Between 1997 and 1998, Anderson paid Gordon $100,000 in hush money, fearing that the story would threaten his starring roles in two family-oriented series, but when Gordon&#x27;s demands increased to $250,000 in 2000, Anderson&#x27;s lawyer informed federal authorities. Gordon, who was 31 at the time, was arrested after leading FBI agents on a high-speed chase along Santa Monica Boulevard. Gordon was fined and sentenced to 21 months in prison.

=== Health ===
In 2003, Anderson underwent two successful heart procedures. 

== Death ==
On January 18, 2022, it was announced that Anderson had been hospitalized in Las Vegas for large B-cell lymphoma; he had first been diagnosed with cancer a decade earlier, but kept the information private. Anderson died of complications from the cancer three days later, on January 21, 2022, at the age of 68.

<doc id="619915" wikidata="Q7196241" url="?curid=619915" title="Pinky Lee">
<text>Pincus Leff (May 2, 1907 – April 3, 1993), better known as Pinky Lee, was an American actor.

==Biography==
Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Lee began his career as Pincus Leff in vaudeville in the 1920s. In January 1925, he was hired by Betty Felsen to be a dancer in the acclaimed Boderick &amp; Felsen vaudeville dancing act. Pincus Leff soon became a featured tap dancer in the act and was often mentioned in advertisements, notices, and reviews. He was part of the act throughout 1925 during its headline tour on the B.F. Keith vaudeville circuit throughout the Mid-West and East. In early 1926, he left the act to pursue his career as Pinky Lee on stage and in film and television. He worked as a comic of the &quot;baggy pants&quot; variety on stage, becoming an expert at slapstick, comic dancing, and rapid-fire jokes of the burlesque style. During the 1940s, he was heard on &quot;Drene Time&quot; and other radio programs.

Easily recognized by his trademark lisp and high-energy antics, his signature costume was a loud plaid suit with baggy checkered pants and an undersized hat. During his routines, whenever anybody irritated him (which happened frequently) he would unleash his catchphrase: &quot;Oooooh! You make me so &quot;mad!&quot;&quot;

===Television===
In 1950, he had his own 30-minute primetime variety television series on NBC, &quot;The Pinky Lee Show&quot;, featuring vaudevillians and burlesque comics. In 1951–52 he starred with Vivian Blaine in a 15-minute sitcom, &quot;Those Two&quot;.

He returned on January 4, 1954, with &quot;The Pinky Lee Show&quot;, a children&#x27;s show sponsored by Tootsie Roll. An Emmy-nominated afternoon children&#x27;s program that spawned later imitators such as &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, it was followed each day by the popular &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot;. Lee opened each show with his trademark theme song, &quot;Yoo Hoo, It&#x27;s Me!&quot;:
Others in the cast: Betty Jane Howarth, Jimmy Brown, Molly Bee, Jack McCoy, Mel Koontz, Cindy Sue, Susabelle, Ken Mayer, Isabel Dwan, Sidney Fields, Margie Lizst, Milton Newberger and Jymme Shore. Adding to the show&#x27;s bounce and style was its musical director and master organist Gaylord Carter, who underscored every moment with appropriate accompaniment.

On September 20, 1955, Lee collapsed on camera during a live show due to illness. His normal antics were so energetic that apparently the cameraman and the show&#x27;s director assumed the fall an &quot;ad lib&quot; part of his performance. The &quot;Peanut Gallery&quot;, an audience usually composed almost entirely of pre-adolescent children who were coached by a staff member, continued their enthusiastic cheering and applause from the on-stage bleachers. After as much as ten seconds of writhing by the stricken Lee, the camera abruptly panned to the still-cheering audience. The following afternoons Pinky Lee was not present. This effectively ended his leading role on the show, which continued without him until June 9, 1956.

Rumors that he had died of a heart attack, prompted by the incident, persisted for decades. Occasionally, newspaper items mentioned the &quot;late&quot; Lee – even though he was performing at a dinner theater in the same city as one of the reporting newspapers. The incident also spawned rumors that Lee had been institutionalized after going insane on live television.

In 1957, Lee hosted &quot;The Gumby Show&quot;, the original appearance of that clay animation character. In 1963, Lee attempted a return to kids&#x27; TV, hosting a local children&#x27;s comedy program on KABC-TV in Los Angeles. This series was nationally syndicated for the 1964–65 TV seasons, but the program fell prey to creative interference from the show&#x27;s producers and station management. Lee fought the interference, but his efforts were for naught. &quot;The Pinky Lee Kids TV Show&quot; went off the air after one season. One episode was released on DVD/VHS by Shokus Video, and a DVD with two episodes was released by Alpha Video.

Lee returned to television in 1983, appearing on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Yummy Awards,&quot; a mock awards show hosted by Ricky Schroder that honored the best children&#x27;s TV programming of the year.

===Movies and theatre===
Lee can be seen in films, including &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot;, &quot;Earl Carroll Vanities&quot;, &quot;Pals of the Golden West&quot;, &quot;South of Caliente&quot;, and &quot;Blonde Ransom&quot;; and Lee appeared on television shows, including Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;.

Lee also appeared in regional theatres throughout the U.S. in &quot;Sugar Babies&quot; and other shows in the late 1980s.

==Personal life==
Lee was married to Bebe (née Beatrice Dancis), with whom he had two children, Patricia Bonnie Lee and Morgan David Lee. Lee&#x27;s brother-in-law was well-known Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman. Lee was also the uncle of the Sherman Brothers, Robert and Richard, with whom he also worked from time to time in the 1950s.

==Later years and death==
In later years, Lee worked as a teacher and appeared in regional musical theater productions. He died in 1993 in Mission Viejo, California. His interment was at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery.

<doc id="619917" wikidata="Q5978290" url="?curid=619917" title="I Love a Mystery">
<text>I Love a Mystery is an American radio drama series that aired 1939–44 and 1949-52, and was written and directed by Carlton E. Morse, about three friends who ran a detective agency and traveled the world in search of adventure. The adventure-mystery series stood in stark contrast to Morse&#x27;s other major radio success, the drama series &quot;One Man&#x27;s Family&quot;.

The central characters, Jack Packard, Doc Long, and Reggie York, met as mercenary soldiers fighting the Japanese in China. Later, they met again in San Francisco, where they decided to form the A-1 Detective Agency. Their motto was &quot;No job too tough, no adventure too baffling&quot;. The agency served as a plot device to involve the trio in a wide variety of stories. These straddled the genres of mystery, adventure, and supernatural horror, and the plot lines often took them to exotic locales. Over the years, Jack was played by Michael Raffetto, Russell Thorson, Jay Novello, Jim Bannon, and John McIntire. Doc was played by Barton Yarborough and Jim Boles. Reggie was portrayed by Walter Paterson and Tony Randall. The agency&#x27;s secretary, Jerry Booker, was played by Gloria Blondell. After Paterson committed suicide in 1942, his friend Morse could not bear to recast the role and Reggie was written out of the series. In later shows, Jerry&#x27;s role was increased, and she replaced Reggie.

==Broadcast history==
Sponsored by Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast, &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; first aired on the NBC West Coast network from January 16 to September 29, 1939, weekdays at 3:15 p.m. Pacific time, and then moved to the full NBC network from October 2, 1939, to March 29, 1940, airing weeknights at 7:15 p.m.

In 1940, it expanded to 30-minute episodes from April 4 to June 27 on NBC Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. Continuing on the Blue Network from September 30, 1940, to June 29, 1942, it was heard Mondays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m.

Procter &amp; Gamble (for Oxydol and Ivory Soap) replaced Fleishmann&#x27;s Yeast as the sponsor in the series broadcast by CBS from March 22, 1943, to December 29, 1944, with 15-minute episodes heard weeknights at 7 p.m.

==Revivals==
After a four-year lapse, Jack, Reggie, and Doc returned in 1948 with a title change to I Love Adventure, broadcast on ABC from April 25 to July 18, 1948. It followed the post-war adventures of the trio who worked for the Twenty-One Old Men of 10 Gramercy Park in London, an extra-governmental organization of some power. &quot;I Love Adventure&quot; ran for 13 episodes.

A year later, &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; was revived on the Mutual Broadcasting System, and the production relocated from Hollywood to New York. This series, which was sustaining, began October 3, 1949, and continued until December 26, 1952, with 15-minute episodes heard weeknights at 7 p.m. during 1949-1950 and then 10:15 p.m. from 1950 to 1952. The Mutual series recreated the original scripts written by Morse for the earlier NBC series.

== Cast ==
The primary characters of &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; and &quot;I Love Adventure&quot; were played by the following actors:

*Jack Packard:
**Michael Raffetto (1939–1942; 1948)
**John McIntire (1943–1944)
**Jay Novello (1943–1944)
**Russell Thorsen (1949–1952)
**Robert Dryden (1952)
*Doc Long:
**Barton Yarborough (1939–1944; 1948)
**Jim Boles (1949–1952)
*Reggie York:
**Walter Paterson (1939–1942)
**Tom Collins (1948)
**Tony Randall (1949–1952)
*Jerry Booker: Gloria Blondell (1942–1944)

==Story situations and characters==
Tough, charismatic group leader Jack is usually the first to figure solutions to the mysteries. Jack has more of an edge than the typical radio hero of the period. He distrusts the attractive women who always seem to show up, and he professes to dislike women in general. The series&#x27; writer claimed that Jack&#x27;s problems with women had to do with his youth. He had gotten a girl pregnant and had to leave his home town in shame. This was only a back story detail and was never made explicit on the show. Doc and Reggie are slightly less edgy characters. The Texas-born Doc is a hard-fighting, boastful, high-spirited character who provides comic relief. Reggie, an Englishman noted for his great strength, however, usually shied away from the fairer sex.

Morse, regarded as one of the best writers in radio, took delight in creating vividly imagined settings for the show and elaborate, often bizarre and at times over-the-top plots. In a medium whose heroes tended to be serious and strait-laced, he created three who were wonderfully reckless and exuberant. Jack, Doc, and Reggie were more interested in the thrill of adventure than in righting wrongs. When they collected a fee, their only goal was to spend it as quickly as possible.

===Controversy===
* Actor Peter Lorre once sent Morse a letter threatening legal action because a character named Michel in two of the serials sounded like Lorre. Morse dropped the character from the series shortly after.
* &quot;The Temple of the Vampires&quot; was the first serial to cause concerned parents to write letters to the network expressing concern about its effect upon children.
* When Walter Paterson committed suicide, the character of Reggie was written out of the series, but he was mentioned by name two years later.

===Theme music===
&quot;Valse Triste&quot; by Jean Sibelius was the program&#x27;s theme music. During the show&#x27;s Mutual run, its opening was a train approaching a grade crossing sounding its horn full-tilt.

===Epilogue===
In 2009 Audio Cinema Entertainment, Inc. got the blessings of the Morse Estate to do recreations of the full series based on the Hollywood run.

==Surviving serials==
Despite the popularity of the program, few series have survived in a listenable state.

===Series that have survived in their entirety===
* &quot;The Thing That Cries in the Night&quot;
* &quot;Bury Your Dead, Arizona&quot;

===Series that have survived in part===
Several or all episodes of the following series are missing, but recreations have been made:
* &quot;Fear Creeps Like a Cat&quot;; all episodes are recreations.
* &quot;The Temple of Vampires&quot;; episodes 8-15 are recreations.

Several episodes of the following series are missing, hence explaining plot holes in surviving copies:
* &quot;The Million Dollar Curse&quot;
* &quot;Battle of the Century&quot;
* &quot;The Hermit of San Felipe Atabapo&quot;

===Reconstructed versions===
In 1989, Episodes 8-15 of &quot;The Temple of Vampires&quot; were recreated for Bud Carey&#x27;s &quot;Old Radio Theater&quot; on KALW with Frank Knight, Pat Franklin, Nicky Emmanuel and Rosemary Leever.

&quot;The Fear That Creeps Like A Cat&quot;, the serial preceding &quot;The Thing That Cries in the Night&quot;, was completely recreated in 1996 by Jim Harmon Productions starring Les Tremayne as Jack Packard, Tony Clay as Doc Long, Frank Bresee as Reggie York, and Fred Foy as the announcer.

==Film, TV and comics adaptations==
A 1945 mystery film called &quot;I Love A Mystery&quot; starred Jim Bannon as Jack, Barton Yarborough as Doc, George Macready, and Nina Foch. Reggie did not appear in the movies as he had been written out of the radio series. The movie was about a man who seeks protection after he predicts his own death in three days. Two more movies in the series starring Bannon and Yarborough followed in 1946: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Mask&quot; and &quot;The Unknown&quot;.

Also, Jim Bannon starred in a fourth ILAM theatrical movie—sort of—when &quot;The Fear That Creeps Like A Cat&quot; was adapted as &quot;The Missing Juror&quot;. The names Jack Packard, etc. were dropped and Bannon played a Packard-like character named Joe Keats.

A TV movie which was also a TV pilot was produced for Universal Studios in 1967, and starred Les Crane as Jack, David Hartman as Doc, and Hagan Beggs as Reggie. The movie was based on the radio episode &quot;The Thing That Cries in the Night&quot;. After being shelved for six years, NBC aired the movie in 1973.

&quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; was an influence in the development of the long-running Hanna-Barbera franchise Scooby-Doo in its early stages of development as a live-action series under the working titles &quot;Mysteries Five&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Scared?&quot;

The radio show was also adapted in a comic book version by Don Sherwood.

<text>Loch Awe (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Loch Obha&quot;; also sometimes anglicised as Lochawe, Lochaw, or Lochow) is a large body of freshwater in Argyll and Bute, Scottish Highlands. It has also given its name to a village on its banks, variously known as Loch Awe or Lochawe. There are islands within the loch such as Innis Chonnell and Inishail.

== The loch ==
It is the third largest freshwater loch in Scotland with a surface area of . It is the longest freshwater loch in Scotland, measuring from end to end with an average width of . The loch runs approximately south-west to north-east, roughly parallel to the two sea lochs of Loch Etive and Loch Fyne. Via the River Awe and Loch Etive it drains westward from its northern end and thus into the Atlantic Ocean. At the narrowest section of the loch are North Port (Taychreggan Hotel) and South Port (Portsonachan Hotel). Once used by cattle drovers, a ferry ran between these shores to facilitate crossing to markets beyond. The Transatlantic Cable, which runs through the village of Kilchrenan, was laid across at this point in 1955.

==Hydroelectric schemes==
Loch Awe is the site of two hydroelectric facilities. One, Inverawe power station (owned by SSE - formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, originally the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board 1943-1990), is a conventional hydro power scheme created by damming the River Awe in the Pass of Brander at Awe Barrage, and feeding the water through a large submerged tunnel; thus generating electricity as it emerges at the power station and rejoins the River Awe, flowing into Loch Etive. The turbine is of the Kaplan type, designed and constructed by Boving and Company of London, and develops 40,500 brake horsepower (30.2 MW). This drives a single 30.5 MW English Electric alternator via a vertical shaft.

Water is also passed through the Awe Barrage, powering 2x Neyrpic 375 kW bulb turbines as it does so. In so doing, this water provides a constant flow into the upper River Awe. A fish pass also exists at Awe Barrage to allow the passage of spawning salmon into Loch Awe and beyond. Despite continued faith in fish passes since the 1800s, research shows that they hinder upstream migration of salmon. The young salmon (smolts), eventually pass downstream either through the Inverawe hydro power station or the barrage structure. The hydro station features a slow rotating Kaplan turbine, which delays the passage of smolts, discourages descent, and increases predation by fish such as pike and brown trout. Both Inverawe power station and the associated Awe Barrage were constructed by the North of Scotland Hydro Electricity Board during the late 1950s/early 1960s.

The second is a more unusual pumped storage facility, using an artificial loch in the hills above Loch Awe. Water is pumped up to the top pool (the headpond), during times of surplus power; and released to power 4 pump/generators situated inside the mountain at times of peak demand. The second project, known as Cruachan from the name of the hill above, (Ben Cruachan) has a visitor centre, which includes tours into the heart of the mountain. This scheme has an installed power capacity of 440 MW, and an energy capacity of 7 GWh. It was built by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board before transferring into the ownership of Scottish Power, where it remained for many years. It was acquired by the Drax Energy group in January 2019.

A third project, located at Balliemeanoch, aims to store 45 GWHh and deliver 1.5 GW for 30 hours.

==Tourism==
Loch Awe is renowned for its trout fishing. Salmon pass through the loch, coming past the barrage in the River Awe and continuing into the River Orchy. Loch Awe contains several ruined castles on islands, and at the northern end has one of the most photographed castles in Scotland, Kilchurn Castle, which in summer may be visited by a short boat trip or by a half mile walk from a small car park just after the bridge over the River Orchy. Saint Conan&#x27;s Kirk and Chapel of St Fyndoca are located in Loch Awe.

==History==

One of the oldest Argyll clans, the Macarthurs, owned lands around Loch Awe which was populated in close proximity with MacGregors, Campbells and Stewarts.

Clan Macarthur artefacts, including the four-poster state bed, are held at Inveraray Castle.

It was from Loch Awe and surrounding area that Clan Campbell established itself as a powerful family. In 1308, Robert the Bruce defeated the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of the Pass of Brander downstream from the loch.

==Vessels operated on the loch==
List of ships which operated on Loch Awe.

== Environs ==

The A85 road and the West Highland Line run along the northern bank of the loch, and the A819 follows the south-east bank for a short distance up to the village of Cladich. From there the single-track B840 runs for the remaining distance to the head of the loch at Ford and then joining the A816 a short distance north of Kilmartin. Similarly, on the north-west side an unclassified single-track road runs the full length from the A85 in Taynuilt to Ford.

;Lochawe village and Loch Awe railway station
At the northern tip of the Loch, a railway station was opened in 1880 when the Callander and Oban Railway passed that way, and a large luxury hotel was created (Loch Awe Hotel, 1871). There is also the Ben Cruachan Inn which used to be the coach-house for the hotel. A village has grown up around the hotel, essentially running along the single strip defined by the A85 road. A steamer service used to operate on the loch from the pier just below the hotel, stopping at Portsonachan, Taycreggan, Eredine and Ford. The village now includes St Conan’s Kirk, one of the most interesting pieces of Church architecture in Scotland. Confusingly, while the railway station is called Loch Awe, the village is contracted to Lochawe. The author Mary Stewart resided in her Lochard home, House of Letterawe, during the last several decades of her long life.

<doc id="619925" wikidata="Q217446" url="?curid=619925" title="Lollipop">
<text>A lollipop is a type of sugar candy usually consisting of hard candy mounted on a stick and intended for sucking or licking. Different informal terms are used in different places, including lolly, sucker, sticky-pop, etc. Lollipops are available in many flavors and shapes.

== Types ==

Lollipops are available in several colors and flavors, particularly fruit flavors. Numerous companies produce lollipops in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. They can range from very small candies bought in bulk and given away as a courtesy at banks, barbershops, and other locations to very large treats made from candy canes twisted into a spiral shape.

Most lollipops are eaten at room temperature, but &quot;ice lollipops&quot;, &quot;ice lollies&quot;, or &quot;popsicles&quot; are frozen water-based lollipops. Some lollipops contain fillings, such as bubble gum or soft candy. Some novelty lollipops have more unusual items, such as mealworm larvae, embedded in the candy. Other novelty lollipops have non-edible centers, such as a flashing light embedded within the candy; there is also a trend, principally in North America, of lollipops with sticks attached to a motorized device that makes the candy spin around in one&#x27;s mouth.

In the Nordic countries, Germany, and the Netherlands, some lollipops are flavored with salmiak.

=== Medicinal use ===
Lollipops can be used to carry medicines.

Some lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion. Flavored lollipops containing medicine are intended to give children medicine without fuss.

Actiq is a potent analgesic lollipop whose active ingredient is fentanyl. Often, patients use large amounts of opioid pain medication and take Actiq on a handle in order to control breakthrough cancer pain.

== History ==
The idea of an edible candy on a stick is straightforward, and it is probable that the lollipop has been invented and reinvented numerous times. The first confections that closely resemble lollipops date back to the Middle Ages when the nobility would often eat boiled sugar with the aid of sticks or handles.

The invention of the modern lollipop is still a mystery, but many American companies in the early 20th century have laid claim to it. According to the book &quot;Food for Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World&quot;, they were invented by George Smith of New Haven, Connecticut, who started making large hard candies mounted on sticks in 1908. He named them after a racehorse of the time, Lolly Pop—and trademarked the lollipop name in 1931.

English lexicographer Francis Grose recorded the term&#x27; lollipop&#x27; in 1796. The term may have derived from the terms &quot;lolly&quot; (tongue) and &quot;pop&quot; (slap). The first references to the lollipop in its modern context date to the 1920s. Alternatively, it may be a word of Romani origin, related to the Roma tradition of selling candy apples on a stick. &quot;Red apple&quot; in the Romani language is &quot;&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
The main ingredients in a standard lollipop are sugar and corn syrup. Sugars are fully hydrated carbon chains, meaning that there is a water molecule attached to each carbon. Sugars come in two forms: straight-chain and ring form. When sugars are in straight-chain form, aldehyde and ketone groups are open, which leaves them very susceptible to reaction. In this state, sugars are unstable. In ring form, sugars are stable and therefore exist in this form in most foods, including lollipops.

Sugar interacts differently depending on the presence of other ingredients and on various treatments. When heated enough to break the molecules apart, sugar generates a complex flavor, changes color, and creates a pleasing aroma. Sugar can form two types of solids in foods: crystalline and glassy amorphous. Glassy amorphous solids can be found in products such as lollipops, marshmallows, and caramels. Glassy amorphous solids result when moderate sugar concentrations (50% solutions) are heated to high temperatures, eliminating nearly all moisture. The final moisture content is around 1–2%, whereas the final moisture content in crystalline candies is 8–12%. The non-crystalline nature of glassy amorphous solids is due to the presence of inhibitors in the solution. Without an inhibitor, crystallization would occur spontaneously and rapidly as the sugar cools due to its high concentration. Some common inhibitors used in lollipop production are corn syrup, cream of tartar, honey, and butter.

In a lollipop, the moisture content falls to less than 2% at the end of the lollipop-making process; water is required at the start of the process. All other ingredients used in the process of lollipop production are optional. The use of inhibitors is dependent on the type of sugar used. The amount of inhibitor in the lollipop is usually small in comparison to the amount of sugar used. Additional flavors, colorings, and inclusions (like bubble gum or a Tootsie Roll) can be added to the final product but are not part of the main structure of a simple lollipop.

== Manufacturing ==
The formation and physical state of the glassy amorphous structure used in the creation of the lollipop are involved in a chemical process. The heating process is the first step in making lollipops after mixing the main ingredients. During heating, the molecules increase their translational mobility and resemble liquids. Although many hard candies are heated to about , the temperature that the solution is heated to is dependent on the specific volume and contents of the mixture. After heating is complete, the solution can then be cooled. The final cooled solution is supersaturated due to the moisture content dropping below 2%. Supersaturated or supercooled liquids are also formed due to inhibitors preventing crystallization. They are unstable because crystallization is a favored reaction in this case. During the cooling process, lollipops&#x27; most important physicochemical characteristic, the glass transition process, occurs.

<text>Gravitational collapse is the contraction of an astronomical object due to the influence of its own gravity, which tends to draw matter inward toward the center of gravity. Gravitational collapse is a fundamental mechanism for structure formation in the universe. Over time an initial, relatively smooth distribution of matter, after sufficient accretion, may collapse to form pockets of higher density, such as stars or black holes.

Star formation involves a gradual gravitational collapse of interstellar medium into clumps of molecular clouds and potential protostars. The compression caused by the collapse raises the temperature until thermonuclear fusion occurs at the center of the star, at which point the collapse gradually comes to a halt as the outward thermal pressure balances the gravitational forces. The star then exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium. During the star&#x27;s evolution a star might collapse again and reach several new states of equilibrium.

==Star formation==

An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in hydrostatic equilibrium as long as the kinetic energy of the gas pressure is in balance with the potential energy of the internal gravitational force. Mathematically this is expressed using the virial theorem, which states that to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy. If a pocket of gas is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo gravitational collapse. The critical mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the Jeans mass. This mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.

==Stellar remnants==

At what is called the star&#x27;s death (when a star has burned out its fuel supply), it will undergo a contraction that can be halted only if it reaches a new state of equilibrium. Depending on the mass during its lifetime, these stellar remnants can take one of three forms:

* White dwarfs, in which gravity is opposed by electron degeneracy pressure 
* Neutron stars, in which gravity is opposed by neutron degeneracy pressure and short-range repulsive neutron–neutron interactions mediated by the strong force
* Black hole, in which there is no force strong enough to resist gravitational collapse
===White dwarf===

The collapse of the stellar core to a white dwarf takes place over tens of thousands of years, while the star blows off its outer envelope to form a planetary nebula. If it has a companion star, a white dwarf-sized object can accrete matter from the companion star. Before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (about one and a half times the mass of the Sun, at which point gravitational collapse would start again), the increasing density and temperature within a carbon-oxygen white dwarf initiate a new round of nuclear fusion, which is not regulated because the star&#x27;s weight is supported by degeneracy rather than thermal pressure, allowing the temperature to rise exponentially. The resulting runaway carbon detonation completely blows the star apart in a type Ia supernova.

===Neutron star===

Neutron stars are formed by the gravitational collapse of the cores of larger stars. They are the remnant of supernova types Ib, Ic, and II. Neutron stars are expected to have a skin or &quot;atmosphere&quot; of normal matter on the order of a millimeter thick, underneath which they are composed almost entirely of closely packed neutrons called neutron matter with a slight dusting of free electrons and protons mixed in. This degenerate neutron matter has a density of about .

The appearance of stars composed of exotic matter and their internal layered structure is unclear since any proposed equation of state of degenerate matter is highly speculative. Other forms of hypothetical degenerate matter may be possible, and the resulting quark stars, strange stars (a type of quark star), and preon stars, if they exist, would, for the most part, be indistinguishable from a neutron star: In most cases, the exotic matter would be hidden under a crust of &quot;ordinary&quot; degenerate neutrons. 

===Black holes===
According to Einstein&#x27;s theory, for even larger stars, above the Landau–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, also known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (roughly double the mass of the Sun) no known form of cold matter can provide the force needed to oppose gravity in a new dynamical equilibrium. Hence, the collapse continues with nothing to stop it. 
Once a body collapses to within its Schwarzschild radius it forms what is called a black hole, meaning a spacetime region from which not even light can escape. It follows from general relativity and the theorem of Roger Penrose that the subsequent formation of some kind of singularity is inevitable. Nevertheless, according to Penrose&#x27;s cosmic censorship hypothesis, the singularity will be confined within the event horizon bounding the black hole, so the spacetime region outside will still have a well-behaved geometry, with strong but finite curvature, that is expected to evolve towards a rather simple form describable by the historic Schwarzschild metric in the spherical limit and by the more recently discovered Kerr metric if angular momentum is present. If the precursor has a magnetic field, it is dispelled during the collapse, as black holes are thought to have no magnetic field of their own.

On the other hand, the nature of the kind of singularity to be expected inside a black hole remains rather controversial. According to theories based on quantum mechanics, at a later stage, the collapsing object will reach the maximum possible energy density for a certain volume of space or the Planck density (as there is nothing that can stop it). This is the point at which it has been hypothesized that the known laws of gravity cease to be valid. There are competing theories as to what occurs at this point. For example loop quantum gravity predicts that a Planck star would form. Regardless, it is argued that gravitational collapse ceases at that stage and a singularity, therefore, does not form.

====Theoretical minimum radius for a star====

The radii of larger mass neutron stars (about 2.8 solar mass) are estimated to be about 12 km, or approximately 2 times their equivalent Schwarzschild radius.

It might be thought that a sufficiently massive neutron star could exist within its Schwarzschild radius (1.0 SR) and appear like a black hole without having all the mass compressed to a singularity at the center; however, this is probably incorrect. Within the event horizon, the matter would have to move outward faster than the speed of light in order to remain stable and avoid collapsing to the center. No physical force, therefore, can prevent a star smaller than 1.0 SR from collapsing to a singularity (at least within the currently accepted framework of general relativity; this does not hold for the Einstein–Yang–Mills–Dirac system). A model for the nonspherical collapse in general relativity with the emission of matter and gravitational waves has been presented.

<text>Steve Scott (born May 5, 1956) is an American former track athlete. The silver medalist in the 1500 meters at the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki in 1983, Scott owns the U.S. indoor record in the 2000 meters (4:58.6-1981). He held the American outdoor mile record for more than 26 years and also is the former American indoor record holder in the same event. &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; ranked Scott #1 in the U.S. on 10 occasions, and 11 times during his career he was ranked in the top ten in the world by T&amp;FN. Additionally, he participated for the US team at the 1984 Olympics. He finished 5th in the 1500 meter run at the 1988 Olympics held in Korea. Scott was also an Olympian on the 1980 Olympics team which was not allowed to go to Moscow. He ran the sub four-minute mile on 136 occasions in his career, more than any other runner in history.

Scott is also regarded as the founder of speed golf in 1979; on December 2, 1982, Scott set a record for the fastest round of golf played on a regulation course, completing 18 holes in 29 minutes, 33.05 seconds at Miller Golf Course in Anaheim, California. Using only two clubs and running from hole to hole, he posted a score of 95.

==Early years==
Scott grew up in the 1960s in Upland, California. His mother was a runner who preceded the running boom. His father was an overweight physician who smoked and did not see the value of running. Through his mother&#x27;s influence and a coach&#x27;s persistence, Scott ran on Upland&#x27;s cross country team. The persistent coach was Robert Loney, cross country coach and math instructor at Upland High School. Steve caught track fever watching the 1972 Olympics on television, as U.S. runner Dave Wottle won the gold medal in the 800 meters. Wottle is often remembered for running the Olympic final in a golf cap, which he forgot to take off during the medal ceremony while the national anthem played. Wottle&#x27;s cap inspired Scott, so he wore a cap in every race of the 1972 cross country season. In his junior year in high school, Scott made the varsity squad as the fifth runner. In track, he concentrated on the shorter distances and ran the 800 in 1:58 and the mile in 4:30. He also met Kim Votaw, a freshman runner who would eventually become his wife in 1979. The couple was divorced in 1994.

In his senior year, Scott became the top runner on the cross country team and improved his track times to 1:52 in the 800 and 4:15 in the mile. He finished fourth in the CIF California State Meet in the 880 yards and drew several college scholarship offers. He liked coach Len Miller and joined him at the University of California, Irvine in the fall of 1974. He still holds the UCI school record in the 1500, and the UC Irvine Steve Scott Invitational is named after him. While at UCI, Scott won the 1977 NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championships Division-I 1500-meter title after winning the 1500 twice and the mile once at three previous NCAA Division-II meets.

Scott ran his first sub-4:00 mile indoors at the Sunkist Invitational in Los Angeles in January 1977, his junior year in college. The following year, he became an international miler, competing on both sides of the Atlantic. When he graduated with a degree in social ecology in 1978, Scott had already run 11 sub-4:00 miles.

==International running career==
When Sebastian Coe set a mile record of 3:48.95 in Oslo on July 17, 1979, Scott finished second with a time of 3:51.11. Because records at the time were rounded up to the nearest tenth of a second, Scott missed tying Jim Ryun&#x27;s American mile record of 3:51.1 by 1/100 of a second. However, in 1981, the IAAF started to recognize records in running events longer than 400 meters to the hundredth of a second, meaning that Scott&#x27;s 3:51.11 had tied Ryun&#x27;s record, depending on how the times were interpreted.

Scott won the 1500 m at the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials but did not compete at the Moscow Games due to the U.S. boycott. He received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes, and won the 1500 m at the Liberty Bell Classic organised for athletes from boycotting nations. His greatest success at an Olympic or World championship came at the inaugural World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland in 1983, when he won a silver medal behind Steve Cram. At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and the 1988 Games in Seoul, he placed 10th and 5th in the 1500 m respectively.

Perhaps his greatest legacy was setting three American mile records. While there was uncertainty whether his 3:51.11 was at least equal to the American mile record or not, his first undisputed American record came when he ran third in another Oslo race on July 11, 1981 with a time of 3:49.68, becoming the first American to break 3:50 in the event and the fifth ever to do so. 

The following year Scott broke the American mile record twice, both times again at Oslo. First, he won a race on June 26, 1982 in 3:48.53, becoming history&#x27;s third-fastest miler behind Coe and Steve Ovett; then 11 days later he ran 3:47.69, the second-fastest mile in history. That time would stand as the American record for a quarter century until Alan Webb ran 3:46.91 in 2007.

He was the 1500 m bronze medalist at the 1987 Pan American Games.

Scott loved to race—indoors, outdoors, on the roads, and in cross country—sometimes as many as 50 competitions a year. This included three top ten finishes in the U.S. National Cross Country Championships (7th in 1979, 4th in 1980, and 6th in 1981) as well as three victories in the Carlsbad 5000 road race from 1986 to 1988. His times at Carlsbad in 1986 (13:32) and 1988 (13:30) were World Best times for a road 5K. During the decade that followed his first sub-4-minute mile, Scott traveled the world and competed year-round in the United States, Canada, Jamaica, Germany, Sweden, Norway, England, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, Greece, Australia and New Zealand.

In the closing stages of a career that saw Scott race at the highest levels for nearly two decades, his attempt to run a sub-4:00 mile at age-40 in 1996 was derailed by a battle with testicular cancer.

==California State University San Marcos Coach==
He was cured of testicular cancer and since retiring from competition he has built a successful NAIA collegiate programs as Head Coach of Track and Cross Country at Cal State San Marcos. At San Marcos he has led the women&#x27;s team to 3 National Titles from 2009 to 2011, and in 2011 the men&#x27;s team placed 2nd. In 2002, he was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame. Scott and his wife JoAnn live in Lake Kiowa, Texas. They have two sons and a daughter.

<doc id="619938" wikidata="Q14913010" url="?curid=619938" title="Mevalonate pathway">
<text>The mevalonate pathway, also known as the isoprenoid pathway or [[HMG-CoA reductase]] pathway is an essential metabolic pathway present in eukaryotes, archaea, and some bacteria. The pathway produces two five-carbon building blocks called isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are used to make isoprenoids, a diverse class of over 30,000 biomolecules such as cholesterol, vitamin K, coenzyme Q10, and all steroid hormones.

The mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl-CoA and ends with the production of IPP and DMAPP. It is best known as the target of statins, a class of cholesterol lowering drugs. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase within the mevalonate pathway.

==Upper mevalonate pathway==
The mevalonate pathway of eukaryotes, archaea, and eubacteria all begin the same way. The sole carbon feed stock of the pathway is acetyl-CoA. The first step condenses two acetyl-CoA molecules to yield acetoacetyl-CoA. This is followed by a second condensation to form HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl-CoA). Reduction of HMG-CoA yields (R)-mevalonate. These first 3 enzymatic steps are called the upper mevalonate pathway.

==Lower mevalonate pathway==
The lower mevalonate pathway which converts (R)-mevalonate into IPP and DMAPP has 3 variants. In eukaryotes, mevalonate is phosphorylated twice in the 5-OH position, then decarboxylated to yield IPP. In some archaea such as &quot;Haloferax volcanii&quot;, mevalonate is phosphorylated once in the 5-OH position, decarboxylated to yield isopentenyl phosphate (IP), and finally phosphorylated again to yield IPP (Archaeal Mevalonate Pathway I). A third mevalonate pathway variant found in &quot;Thermoplasma acidophilum&quot;, phosphorylates mevalonate at the 3-OH position followed by phosphorylation at the 5-OH position. The resulting metabolite, mevalonate-3,5-bisphosphate, is decarboxylated to IP, and finally phosphorylated to yield IPP (Archaeal Mevalonate Pathway II).

==Regulation and feedback==
Several key enzymes can be activated through DNA transcriptional regulation on activation of SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and -2). This intracellular sensor detects low cholesterol levels and stimulates endogenous production by the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, as well as increasing lipoprotein uptake by up-regulating the LDL-receptor. Regulation of this pathway is also achieved by controlling the rate of translation of the mRNA, degradation of reductase and phosphorylation.

==Pharmacology==
A number of drugs target the &quot;mevalonate pathway&quot;:
* Statins (used to decrease cholesterol levels);
* Bisphosphonates (used to treat various bone-degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis)

==Diseases==
A number of diseases affect the &quot;mevalonate pathway&quot;:
* Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency 
** Mevalonic Aciduria
** Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS).

==Alternative pathway ==
Plants, most bacteria, and some protozoa such as malaria parasites have the ability to produce isoprenoids using an alternative pathway called the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) or non-mevalonate pathway. The output of both the mevalonate pathway and the MEP pathway are the same, IPP and DMAPP, however the enzymatic reactions to convert acetyl-CoA into IPP are entirely different. Interaction between the two metabolic pathways can be studied by using 13C-glucose isotopomers. In higher plants, the MEP pathway operates in plastids while the mevalonate pathway operates in the cytosol. Examples of bacteria that contain the MEP pathway include &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and pathogens such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;.

<text>Agame show hostis an individual who manages a game show, introduces contestants, and asks quiz questions to test the knowledge of said contestants. They may also have other duties pertinent to production.

== History ==
In 1938, Freddie Grisewood was the first game show host. He directed &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;, a fifteen-minute show that was broadcast in the United Kingdom over radio and television.

== Characteristics ==
Especially in the United States, game show hosts have generally been conservative or libertarian in their political beliefs. Reasons for this include many of the hosts&#x27; rural origins (early television personalities were expected to have natural General American English accents, which were most prominent in the Midwest) and the merit-based nature of the game show format.

== World records ==
In June 2014, Alex Trebek set a new world record for &quot;hosting more episodes of a single television game show than anyone else in TV history&quot;. Bob Barker previously held this record. In 2019, Pat Sajak became the longest-running host of any game show, defeating Barker’s previous record of 35 years hosting &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

<doc id="619940" wikidata="Q159539" url="?curid=619940" title="Saxon Switzerland">
<text>Saxon Switzerland (, ) is a hilly climbing area and national park in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. It is located around the Elbe valley south-east of Dresden in Saxony, Germany, adjoining Bohemian Switzerland in the Czech Republic. Together with the Czech part, the region is known as Saxon-Bohemian Switzerland.

The administrative district for the area is Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge. The fortress of Königstein is a well-known landmark.

== Etymology ==
The German name for Saxon Switzerland, &quot;Sächsische Schweiz&quot;, appeared in the 18th century. Two Swiss artists, Adrian Zingg and Anton Graff, were appointed in 1766 to the Dresden Academy of Art. 
They felt the landscape was reminiscent of their homeland, the Swiss Jura, and reported in their exchange of letters on the difference between their homeland and &quot;Saxon Switzerland&quot;. Previously, the Saxon part of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains had merely been referred to as the &quot;Meißner Hochland&quot;, &quot;Meißen Oberland&quot; or &quot;Heide über Schandau&quot;.

The description became popular through the publication of the name by Wilhelm Lebrecht Götzinger. In his books he described the area as Saxon Switzerland and made the term known to a wide audience.

In English the usual translation is &quot;Saxon Switzerland&quot;. However other sources call it &quot;Saxony Switzerland&quot; or even &quot;Swiss Saxony&quot;.

== Geography ==

Saxon Switzerland forms the northern part of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains range, located on the German-Czech border. To the east, it transitions into the Lusatian Highlands and, to the west, into the Ore Mountains. The Czech part of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains is partly formed by the Bohemian Switzerland national park. The highest elevation in Saxon Switzerland is the Großer Zschirnstein at 562 m above sea level.

=== Natural region classification ===
In the classification of natural regions by Emil Meynen, Saxon Switzerland was a major unit (430) within the Saxon-Bohemian Chalk Sandstone Region (main unit group 43), whose only other major unit on German soil was the Zittau Mountains. The boundary between the two mountain ranges, the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and the Lusatian Mountains, is located on Czech territory, which is why these natural regions are geographically separated from one another.

The Ecosystem and Regional Character working group of the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig has now, at the beginning of the 21st century, grouped all ranges in the Saxon-Bohemian border region into the super unit Saxon Highlands and Uplands (&quot;Sächsisches Bergland und Mittelgebirge&quot;). The Lusatian Mountains between Saxon Switzerland and the Zittau Mountains also belong to it, whereas Meynen had grouped it with the loess hill country to the north and east into the major unit of Upper Lusatia (&quot;Oberlausitz&quot;); to the west the new super unit is continued by the main unit groups of the Ore Mountains and Vogtland.

=== Geological formation ===
See &quot;Elbe Sandstone Mountains (Geology section)&quot;

=== Hills ===

As a rule, two types of hill may be distinguished.

Numerous rock formations in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, in both Saxon Switzerland and Bohemian Switzerland, are known locally in this region as &quot;Steine&quot; (&quot;rocks&quot;). Prominent examples are the Königstein, the Lilienstein, the Gohrisch and the Papststein. This description does not, however, include the dome-shaped &quot;Kuppen&quot; such as the Waitzdorfer Höhe or the Großer Winterberg, whose bedrock is made of volcanic basalt or granitic material.

The Cretaceous sandstone formations soar above the so-called &quot;levels&quot; of their surrounding area, the former level of the River Elbe, and represent the remains of an old peneplain. In the course of the Late Tertiary, uplifting of the Ore Mountains and sideways pressure from the Lusatian Highlands shattered the sandstone plate along lines that intersected like a grid and this, combined with the simultaneously increasing stream velocity of the Elbe and regressive erosion in its side valleys, offered new lines of attack and new routes for the destructive power of water. Initially the larger table hills (&quot;Lilienstein&quot;), or those already deeply fissured like &quot;Zirkelstein&quot;, &quot;Kaiserkrone&quot; or already forested (&quot;Kohlbornstein&quot;), remained, but these too broke up later as a result of erosive destruction into long ridges (&quot;Schrammsteine&quot;) or even into individual rock pinnacles (&quot;Torwächter&quot;). Morphologically harder sections of strata, that resisted karstification longer and more successfully, generally form the uppermost layers. The collapse of rock structures is usually therefore a result of erosion from below or from the flanks.

== History ==
During the early Mediaeval period, the region was settled by Slavs and was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia during the Middle Ages. About 1000 years ago Bohemian-Saxon Switzerland was the borderland of three Slavic tribes. The Nisane tribe (east of the Elbe from Dresden to Pirna), the Milzane tribe (from today&#x27;s Upper Lusatia) and in the south the Dacine tribe shaped the political and economic landscape at that time.

It was not until the 15th century that the area now called Saxon Switzerland came under Saxon hegemony when it became part of the Margraviate of Meissen with boundaries roughly corresponding to those of today.

The development of the area for tourism began in earnest in the 19th century. This was greatly helped by the building of one of the first trolleybus lines in the world: the Biela Valley Trolleybus, which was in operation from 1901 to 1904 and was operated from Königstein.

Romantic artists were inspired by the beauty of wilderness, like the painter Ludwig Richter or the composer Carl Maria von Weber, who set his famous opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; with its Wolfsschlucht (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Gorge&quot;) scene set near the town of Rathen.

In the Nazi era the description of German territories as &quot;Schweiz&quot; (&quot;Switzerland&quot;) was officially banned. For that reason, with effect from 19 October 1938, the official term &quot;Sächsische Schweiz&quot; was replaced by &quot;Amtshauptmannschaft Pirna&quot; and from January 1939 by &quot;Kreis Pirna&quot; in the names of the local places of Königstein, Obervogelgesang, Ottendorf, Porschdorf, Rathen, Rathewalde, Rathmannsdorf and Reinhardtsdorf.

===Medieval castles===
When Germans began to settle in the 13th century, there was a systematic banishment of Bohemian influence and numerous local military conflicts erupted around strategically important fortifications. These fortifications primarily serve to protect the border and trading routes. Due to a lack of central power this protective function was left to local knights. The progressive division of the area due to the hereditary distribution of estates upset the economic balance of the region and many castles degenerated into bases for robber barons.

Not until the middle of the 16th century, when the Wettins captured many of the castles did the situation stabilise. Today, these castles and ruins, some of which are well preserved, are popular with tourists, who make their way to these sites up steep climbing paths.

These castles include: Hohnstein, Hockstein, Neurathen, Altrathen, Königstein, Lilienstein, Falkenstein, Frienstein, and Rauschenstein.

== National park ==

In September 1990, even before the reunification of Germany, a national park was created in Saxon Switzerland in order to protect the unique natural character of the hill range. The 93 km2 area covers two physically separate regions: one near Rathen – the region of the Bastei, Polenz valley, Brand and Uttewalder Grund – and the other embracing the whole Saxon Switzerland Hinterland (&quot;Hintere Sächsische Schweiz&quot;) between the Elbe and the state border with the Czech Republic and including the Schrammsteinen, Großer Winterberg, Großer Zschand and Kirnitzsch valley.

== Rock climbing ==

Saxon Switzerland is characterized by its sandstone rocks which draw many rock climbers. There are some 14,000 climbing routes on over 1,100 rock pinnacles. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Saxon Rules for rock climbing were established. They are considered to be one of the origins of free climbing. Ropes and bolts may only be used for safety but never as a means of climbing. The use of chalk and common means of protection such as nuts and friends is also not permitted; instead knotted nylon slings are used. With a few exceptions, climbing is only practised and permitted at freestanding rock towers.

A Saxon oddity is the concept of a &quot;Baustelle&quot; (literally &quot;building site&quot;) where climbers scale a difficult section by climbing on top of the shoulders of other climbers (sometimes several people on top of each other) with everybody involved only holding himself by holds the rock provides. Though this would normally be considered a form of aid climbing, it is here accepted as a form of free climbing. As the pinnacles are often very close to one other, jumping from one rock to another is also rather popular and this technique even has its own grades of difficulty.

In addition to the climbing summits there are also various steep paths, on which hikers with sure-footedness and a head for heights can climb, in places, great heights with the aid of steps, ladders, metal rungs and railings at various points. Amongst the most popular of these climbing paths are the Häntzschelstiege in the &quot;Affensteinen&quot;, as well as the Heilige Stiege, the Rübezahlstiege and the Rotkehlchenstiege north of Schmilka.

== &quot;Boofen&quot; ==
A &quot;Boofe&quot; (plural: &quot;Boofen&quot;) is local slang for sleeping out overnight in the open under a rock overhang and has a long tradition in Saxon Switzerland. Many young people travel to Saxon Switzerland at weekends in order to &quot;boofen&quot;. Today it is only permitted by the National Park Authority at designated sites. However the growing number of &quot;Boofers&quot; and the bad conduct of individuals (e.g. who light illegal campfires, tear up saplings or cause soil erosion) has led to repeated altercations.

<doc id="619941" wikidata="Q1867269" url="?curid=619941" title="Loch Katrine">
<text>Loch Katrine (; or ) is a freshwater loch in the Trossachs area of the Scottish Highlands, east of Loch Lomond within the Stirling council area. It mostly lies within the historic and registration county of Perthshire, with Glengyle Water and the northern part of the loch&#x27;s mid-line forming part of the boundary with historic Stirlingshire. The loch is about long and wide at its widest point, and runs the length of Strath Gartney (Gaelic: ). It is within the drainage basins of the River Teith and River Forth.

It is a popular scenic attraction for tourists and day-visitors from Glasgow and nearby towns; fly and boat fishing for trout are permitted on the loch from spring to autumn. It also serves as a reservoir for the water supply of the Glasgow conurbation, some south, being connected by two aqueducts constructed in 1859.

It is the fictional setting of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; and of the subsequent opera by Gioachino Rossini, &quot;&quot;.

==Name etymology==
William Watson, a renowned scholar of Scottish place names, judged &quot;Katrine&quot; to be &quot;thoroughly Pictish&quot; in origin, and to derive from an extension of the Celtic root , meaning &quot;dark, gloomy place&quot;, a name referring to the loch&#x27;s heavily forested shores.

The name &quot;Katrine&quot; has also been hypothesized to represent &quot;cateran&quot;, from the Gaelic , a collective word meaning &quot;cattle thief&quot; or possibly &quot;peasantry&quot;.

==Physical geography== 

Loch Katrine is a serpentine lake oriented WNW–ESE, about long, with a maximum width of almost exactly between the mouths of the Letter Burn and the Strone Burn on the northern shore to a small bay on the opposite shore. The mean breadth, obtained by dividing the area of the loch by its length, is , 7.5% of the length.

The loch covers an area of , and drains a mountainous area, some eight times greater, of about . It contains an estimated of water with a mean depth of , being over 40% of the maximum observed depth of .

The surface of the loch is above sea-level, so some of its bottom lies below sea-level, the deepest part being below sea-level. In this respect Loch Katrine differs from the other lakes in the Forth Basin, none of which have any portion of their bottoms below sea level.

Loch Katrine forms a single basin, not being divided, like Loch Lomond and Loch Lubnaig, for instance, into separate basins by any important ridges or rises on the bottom. The deepest part is in the centre of the loch, a long narrow depression, with depths exceeding , extending for over from opposite Coilachra to opposite Huinn Dubh-aird, with a maximum width of over ; this 400-feet depression has an area of about , or 17% of the entire superficial area of the loch. The deepest sounding is situated at the very eastern extremity of the 400-feet depression.

The depression is over long, with a maximum breadth of ; it extends from off Coilachra to near Ellen&#x27;s Isle. The area enclosed between the 300-feet and 400-feet contour lines is about , or 13% of the entire area of the loch.

The depression is in length and in maximum breadth, extending from south of Ellen&#x27;s Isle to near Black Island, where it is separated (by a sounding of ) from a small isolated area, lying between Coilachra and Black Island, in length by nearly broad. The area between the 200- and 300-feet contours is about , or 17% of the area of the loch.

There are two depressions, the principal one ( long) stretching from close to Ellen&#x27;s Isle to Black Island, the other extending from Black Island towards the point called Rudha nam Moine, with a total length of over . The area between the 100- and 200-feet contours is about , or 22% of the area of the loch.

The -feet line follows pretty closely the contour of the loch, from Rudha nam Moine into the eastern arms of the loch at the Trossachs, running outside of Black island, Ellen&#x27;s isle, and the small islands near the shore all round, with a small isolated patch at the junction of the Trossachs arm with the arm leading to Achray Water; it encloses a small shallow, with a beacon on it, opposite the entrance of the Glasahoile. The area between the 50- and 100-feet contours is about , or 13% of the area of the loch, while the area between the coast-line and the 50-feet contour is nearly , or 18% of the loch area; so that 82% of the floor of the loch is covered by over of water.

===Geology===

For 4 miles west from Brenachoil Lodge to Stronachlachar — about the half of the total length of the loch — Loch Katrine has a comparatively flat bottom, enclosed by the 400-feet contour line. The deepest sounding in Loch Katrine, 495 feet, is at the eastern limit of this basin, nearly due south of Brenachoil. Bathymetric charts show that the soundings throughout this basin gradually increase in depth eastwards to Brenachoil Lodge. The position of the deepest sounding is of interest, seeing that the strata which form the floor of the lake at this point consist of schistose micaceous grits, to the north-west of the epidotic grits (&quot;Green Beds&quot;) and Ben Ledi grits, the two latter groups having formed the great rocky barrier at and above the outlet of the lake.

Near the upper end of the loch a rocky barrier crosses the lake from Portnellan by the Black Island to Budha Maoil Mhir an-t Salainn. The deepest sounding along this barrier is , and the shallowest is . On its lower side the contour line almost crosses the lake. Above it there is another basin over half a mile in length, the greatest depth of which is , immediately in front of the rocky ridge just referred to. Westwards the lake shallows, and at its head it has been silted up for a distance of half a mile by alluvium laid down by Glengyle Water.

Below Brenachoil Lodge the soundings show an uneven floor, due probably to ridges of rock rather than to morainic deposits, judged from the geological features on both sides of the lake. Ellen&#x27;s Isle is composed of epidotic grits (&quot;Green Beds&quot;), and the promontories of Am Priosan partly of &quot;Green Beds&quot; and partly of Ben Ledi grits. The promontory between the pier and the sluice is formed of Ben Ledi grits.

Several small faults cross Loch Katrine, but these are of minor importance, and have produced locally a slight brecciation of the strata. It is a typical example of a rock basin. The deepest sounding occurs in the front of the great rocky barrier in the lower part of the lake, in accordance with a theory of glacial erosion.

===Settlements===

The main access points for Loch Katrine are either via Trossachs Pier at the loch&#x27;s eastern end or Stronachlachar (Gaelic &quot;the headland of the stonemason&quot;) towards the western end of the loch. Trossachs Pier essentially consists of a parking space, pier, gift shop and cafe (Katrine Cafe) which are open from the first to the last sailing of the cruise boats (normally 6pm).

On the northern shore are the Brenchoile hunting lodge and the farms Letter (Gaelic: ), Edra (Gaelic: &quot;between them&quot;), Strone (Gaelic: &quot;the nose&quot;), Coilachra, Portnellan (Gaelic: &quot;port of the island&quot;) and Glengyle (Gaelic: &quot;glen of a lowlander&quot;); on the southern are The Dhu (Gaelic: &quot;the black&quot;) at the western end of the loch, Stronachlachar, the Royal Cottage, Culligart and Glasahoile (Gaelic: &quot;greywood&quot;). The roads and paths do not circle the loch completely, as the southern road stops at Glasahoile.

===Islands===
There are several small islands in Loch Katrine such as Ellen&#x27;s Isle (Gaelic: &quot;the shingly isle&quot;), the Black Isle and Factor&#x27;s Island (Gaelic: ).

==History==
Loch Katrine is now owned by Scottish Water, and has been the primary water reservoir for much of the city of Glasgow and its surrounding areas since 1859. The water level has been artificially raised by around - the loch can be drawn down by a maximum of . The water drawn down provides gravitational flow, using the Katrine aqueduct, to the Milngavie water treatment works via two long aqueducts and of tunnel. Old photos showing the building of the aqueducts were discovered in a skip in Possilpark in 2018.

The treatment works in Milngavie are almost above sea level: sufficient to provide adequate water pressure to the majority of the town without the need for pumping. The system can deliver up to a day. Construction was started in 1855 and the works was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859. The aqueduct was built under the guidance of the eminent civil engineer John Frederick Bateman (1810–1889). The second aqueduct was opened in 1901.

Water levels are supplemented via a dam and short tunnel from Loch Arklet, a reservoir between Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond, beside the road to Inversnaid; this project was completed in 1914. A longer tunnel beneath Ben A&#x27;an bringing water from the Glen Finglas Reservoir was completed in 1958, and the dam was completed in 1965.

Oil-fired vessels are not permitted to sail on Loch Katrine because of the danger of pollution to the drinking water of Glasgow. The steamboat SS &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; has provided sailings on the loch since 1900. It was coal-fired until 2007, when it was converted to use bio-diesel fuel, and continues to provide local tourist transport between Trossachs Pier and Stronachlachar during the summer.

The loch is the subject of The Athole Highlanders&#x27; Farewell to Loch Katrine.

==Trivia==
*Loch Katrine is also the name of a lake in North Canterbury, New Zealand.
*Rob Roy MacGregor was born at the head of the loch.

<text>John Higgins (born 18 May 1975) is a Scottish professional snooker player from Wishaw in North Lanarkshire. Since turning professional in 1992, he has won 31 ranking titles, placing him in third position on the all-time list of ranking event winners, behind Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan (41) and Stephen Hendry (36). He has won four World Championships, three UK Championships and two Masters titles, for a total of nine Triple Crown titles, putting him level with Mark Selby and behind only O&#x27;Sullivan (23), Hendry (18) and Steve Davis (15). He first entered the top 16 in the 1995–96 world rankings and remained there continuously for over 29 years until September 2024, setting a record for the longest uninterrupted tenure as a top-16 player. He reached the world number one position four times.

In 2010, a tabloid newspaper carried out a sting operation in Ukraine, in which it claimed to show Higgins and his then-manager arranging to lose specific frames in future matches for money. An investigation cleared Higgins of match-fixing allegations but the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association found that he had brought the sport into disrepute by failing to disclose an invitation to breach the sport&#x27;s betting rules and giving the impression of agreeing to it. Higgins was banned from professional competition for six months and fined £75,000. After winning his fourth world title in 2011, Higgins&#x27; form became less consistent and he has gone for lengthy periods without title wins. He reached three consecutive World Championship finals between 2017 and 2019, but lost each time, to Selby in 2017, to Mark Williams in 2018, and to Judd Trump in 2019. In the 2021–22 season, he lost five major finals, including the 2022 Tour Championship, when he led Neil Robertson 9–4 but lost the match 9–10.

Higgins made his 1,000th professional century break at the 2024 English Open, becoming the second player, after O&#x27;Sullivan, to reach that milestone. He has made 13 officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition, second only to O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 15, and holds the record as the oldest player to make a professional maximum, achieved at the 2024 Championship League when he was aged 48 years and 268 days. Alongside O&#x27;Sullivan and Williams, he is one of the three players known as the &quot;Class of &#x27;92&quot;, who all turned professional during the 1992–93 snooker season.

==Career==

===Early professional years, first world championship===
As amateur players, Higgins and Mark Williams faced each other in two finals in 1991. At the World Junior Masters Higgins won, while Williams won the British Junior Championship. The following year, Higgins turned professional. He reached the last eight of the 1993 British Open during his first season on the tour, before losing 3–5 to Jimmy White. Aged 19, Higgins defeated Dave Harold 9–6 in the final of the 1994 Grand Prix. This was the first ranking title of his career. The same season, he also won the 1995 International Open and the 1995 British Open, making him the first teenager to win three ranking events in a single season. He reached the finals of the 1995 Welsh Open, losing 3–9 to Steve Davis, and the 1995 Masters, losing by the same score to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. His first time playing at the World Snooker Championship in 1995 he lost 3–10 in the first round to fellow Scottish player Alan McManus. Later that year he won his fourth ranking title at the inaugural 1995 German Open beating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final.

At the 1996 International Open he defeated Rod Lawler 9–3 in the final, to retain the championship. Later that season, at the 1996 World Snooker Championship, he defeated Martin Clarke 10–5 in the first round and McManus 13–5 in the second round. Facing O&#x27;Sullivan in the quarter-finals, he led 12–10, but lost the match 12–13 after O&#x27;Sullivan won the last three frames. At the 1996 UK Championship, he defeated Tony Drago, Williams and Doherty to reach the final, where he faced the world champion, Stephen Hendry. Higgins trailed 4–8 before winning five consecutive frames to lead 9–8; however, he lost the final 9–10. He won his sixth ranking title at the 1997 European Open, defeating Parrott 9–5 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals again at the 1997 World Championship, but lost 9–13 to eventual winner Doherty. He won the 1997 German Open, beating Parrott 9–4 in the final, and won his eighth ranking title at the 1998 British Open, beating Hendry 9–8 in the final.

At the 1998 World Snooker Championship, Higgins defeated Jason Ferguson 10–8, Anthony Hamilton 13–9, John Parrott 13–11 and O&#x27;Sullivan 17–9 in the semi-finals. In the final, he defeated the defending champion Doherty 18–12 to win his first World Championship and ninth ranking title. He made a then-record 14 centuries during the tournament (Hendry beat his record, with 16 centuries, at the 2002 World Championship, which Mark Williams equalled at the 2022 World Championship). Higgins&#x27; success had seen him advance rapidly up the world rankings. In the 1994/1995 rankings, he was 51st; in the 1995/1996 rankings, he was 11th; and in the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 rankings, he was second. After winning the world title, Higgins became world number one in the 1998/1999 rankings, ending Hendry&#x27;s eight consecutive years in the top spot.

===After the first world title===
During the 1998–99 season, Higgins won the 1998 UK Championship, defeating Matthew Stevens 10–6 in the final, and the 1999 Masters, defeating Doherty 10–8 in the final. By winning the UK, Masters and World Championships, Higgins completed a career Triple Crown. He was also the third player, after Steve Davis and Hendry, to hold the three titles simultaneously, an achievement later emulated by Mark Williams. Higgins is also one of six players to have won both the World Championship and UK Championship in the same calendar year; the others are Davis, Hendry, Parrott, O&#x27;Sullivan and Mark Selby.

Higgins held the world number one position for two seasons before Williams replaced him at the top of the rankings. Higgins and Williams met in the 1999 Grand Prix final, where Higgins came from 2–6 down to claim a 9–8 victory. They also met in the 2000 World Snooker Championship semi-finals, where Higgins initially led 14–10 but ultimately lost 15–17. They also played again in the 2000 UK Championship final, where Higgins won 10–4 to claim his second UK title. Higgins reached his second world final at the 2001 World Snooker Championship, but lost 14–18 to O&#x27;Sullivan. At the beginning of the 2001–02 season, he became the first player to win the opening three tournaments in a season: the 2001 Champions Cup in August, the 2001 Scottish Masters in September, and the 2001 British Open in October. He failed to win a major title for another three years, until the 2004 British Open. Clive Everton later claimed that Higgins &quot;lost his edge&quot; during this period, due to becoming preoccupied with fatherhood; Higgins&#x27; wife Denise confirmed that she had to &quot;push him out of the house to practise&quot;.

In the 2005 Grand Prix final, Higgins comprehensively defeated O&#x27;Sullivan 9–2. He became the first player to make four consecutive centuries in a ranking event, with breaks of 103, 104, 138 and 128 in frames 7–10. Higgins also scored a then-record 494 points without reply in the match. Of Higgins&#x27; performance, O&#x27;Sullivan commented that he had &quot;never seen anything like it&quot;, while Everton stated that Higgins was &quot;back to the kind of form which gave him the 1998 world title&quot;. Higgins and O&#x27;Sullivan also faced each other in consecutive Masters finals in 2005 and 2006. Higgins lost 3–10 in 2005. In 2006, he lost the first three frames, but won the next five to lead after the first session. O&#x27;Sullivan levelled the scores in the evening session and the match went to a deciding frame. O&#x27;Sullivan missed a to a while on a of 60, and Higgins made a of 64 to win 10–9 and claim his second Masters title.

===Second and third world titles===
At the 2007 World Snooker Championship, Higgins beat Michael Holt, Fergal O&#x27;Brien, O&#x27;Sullivan and Stephen Maguire en route to the final. Trailing 10–14 against Maguire, Higgins won 17–15, making the 1,000th century to be made at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield since the World Championship was first staged there in 1977. In the final, Higgins held a 12–4 advantage over Selby overnight, but Selby reduced his arrears to a single frame on day two. However, at 14–13, Higgins rediscovered his form to win four consecutive frames to clinch the match 18–13 to secure his second World title at 12:54 am, the latest finish to a World final (equalled when Neil Robertson beat Graeme Dott in 2010); and nine years after his first title – the longest time span between successes since Alex Higgins (1972, 1982) and the longest at the Crucible. He regained world number one status.

As World Champion, Higgins best performance was only reaching the quarter-final stages in the Welsh Open and China Open tournaments. He helped to establish, and actively promoted, the World Series of Snooker – a tour intended to bring snooker to new venues outside the traditional United Kingdom and recently developed Far East markets. He won the inaugural event in St. Helier in June 2008, beating Mark Selby 6–3 in the final. Higgins also devised a new players&#x27; union with his manager Pat Mooney, called The Snooker Players Association. He won the Grand Prix for the fourth time in 2008, beating Ryan Day 9–7 in the final in Glasgow – his first ranking tournament win on home soil.

At the 2009 World Snooker Championship, Higgins beat Michael Holt 10–5 in round one. His second-round and quarter-final matches both went the full distance of 25 frames, with Higgins overcoming Jamie Cope and Mark Selby, respectively, to win 13–12. He established a 13–3 lead in the semi-final against Mark Allen and progressed 17–13 . Higgins recorded an 18–9 victory over Shaun Murphy in the final to become the ninth player to win the World title three or more times after Joe Davis, Fred Davis, John Pulman, John Spencer, Ray Reardon, Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

In the 2009–10 season, as reigning World Champion, he lost 5–6 on the black ball to Neil Robertson in the semi-final of the Grand Prix; and 8–10 to Ding Junhui in the final of the UK Championship, after surviving a comeback by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-final when leading 8–2, to advance 9–8 the previous evening. He also defeated Neil Robertson 9–8 during the tournament. He captured the Welsh Open title by defeating Ali Carter 9–4 in the final, and ended the season as world number one despite an 11–13 loss to Steve Davis in round two of the World Championship.

===Match-fixing allegations and fourth world title===
====Suspension====
On 2 May 2010, Higgins and his manager, Pat Mooney, a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) board member, were the subject of match-fixing allegations. They were filmed in a sting operation conducted by the &quot;News of the World&quot;. On 30  April, an undercover &quot;News of the World&quot; team, led by Mazher Mahmood, posing as promoters, had met Higgins and his manager in a hotel room in Kyiv under the pretence of organising a series of events linked to the World Series of Snooker. The newspaper alleged that Higgins and Mooney had agreed to lose four frames in four separate tournaments in exchange for a total payment of €300,000 and further discussed the mechanics of how to fix a frame, which tournaments and opponents to choose and how Higgins would receive the money. Higgins was immediately suspended from the game and Mooney resigned from his position on the WPBSA board. Higgins issued a statement on the day of the allegations. He denied that he had ever been involved in match-fixing and explained that he had decided to &quot;play along&quot; out of fears for his safety, suspecting the involvement of the Russian Mafia.

A full investigation was conducted into the allegations by David Douglas, former Metropolitan Police detective chief superintendent and head of the WPBSA&#x27;s disciplinary committee. The independent tribunal that followed in September 2010, hosted by Sports Resolutions (UK) and chaired by Ian Mill QC, concurred that the WPBSA was right to conclude that Higgins had truthfully accounted for his words and actions and to withdraw the more serious charges of match-fixing, but found him guilty of &quot;giving the impression&quot; that he would breach betting rules and of failing to report the approach made to him by the &quot;News of the World&quot;. Higgins received a six-month ban, backdated to the start of his suspension period, and was fined £75,000.

====Return to snooker====

Higgins returned to professional competition on 12 November 2010 in the Ruhr Championship – European Players Tour Championship (EPTC) event five in Hamm and went on to win the tournament beating Shaun Murphy 4–2 in the final. At the next event, the Prague Classic, the sixth European Players Tour event, he reached the final again, but lost 3–4 to Michael Holt.

At the 2010 UK Championship, his first tournament on British soil since his return, he reached his third final in succession. He fought back from 2–7 and 5–9 down against Mark Williams, and from 7–9 after trailing 0–61 and needing a to level the match. He made a 68 break in the decider and sealed a 10–9 victory with a on the . As a result of his progress in those three events, where he won 18 out of 19 matches, Higgins earned sufficient points to regain his position as world number one under the new two-year rolling ranking system after having slipped to third by missing the start of the 2010–11 snooker season.

Higgins lost in the first round of the 2011 Masters 4–6 against Graeme Dott, and withdrew from the German Masters after defeating Robert Milkins 5–3 in round one, to return home due to the deteriorating health of his father, who subsequently died from cancer. A little over two weeks later, Higgins successfully defended his Welsh Open title by beating Stephen Maguire 9–6 in the final – dedicating victory to his late father. Higgins won the Hainan Classic, defeating Jamie Cope in the final. Higgins reached the quarter-final of the China Open, where he lost 2–5 against Shaun Murphy. Higgins&#x27; next tournament was the Scottish Professional Championship, where he defeated Anthony McGill 6–1 in the final.

In the 2011 World Snooker Championship, Higgins defeated Stephen Lee 10–5 in the first round, Rory McLeod 13–7 in the second round and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 13–10 in the quarter-finals. On the way to a 17–14 victory over Mark Williams in the semi-finals, Higgins was heckled by an audience member who shouted out, &quot;How do you swallow that three hundred thousand, John? ... You&#x27;re a disgrace to snooker.&quot; Higgins went on to defeat Judd Trump 18–15 in the final to win his fourth world title, which prompted Steve Davis to comment &quot;I think John Higgins is the best snooker player I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life&quot;. Despite the victory, Higgins lost the world number one ranking to Mark Williams.

===After the fourth world title (2011–2017)===
In the 2011–12 snooker season, reaching only two quarter-finals of major ranking events. His season-best performance was reaching the semi-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy. Before the 2012 World Snooker Championship, he admitted that he had not practiced much throughout the season and did not feel confident about defending his title. In the first round of the tournament, he came from 6–8 down to defeat Liang Wenbo 10–9. He then played Hendry in the second round, the first time the two players had ever met in a World Championship match, but Hendry won 13–4, with Higgins calling it the worst he had ever played at the Crucible. He finished the season ranked world number five.
Higgins started the 2012–13 season by winning his 25th ranking title at the Shanghai Masters, after coming back from 2–7 down to defeat Judd Trump 10–9 in the final. He made a maximum break during the final and another in his second-round match against Mark Davis at the 2012 UK Championship. He won the minor-ranking Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, defeating Trump 4–2 in the final, also reaching the final of the minor-ranking Bulgarian Open, where he lost 0–4 to Trump. However, Higgins did not enjoy sustained success for the rest of the season, reaching only one other semi-final of a major ranking event, the World Open, which he lost 2–6 to Mark Allen. He exited the 2013 World Snooker Championship in the first round, losing 6–10 to Mark Davis. Afterward, he admitted that doubts about whether he could remain at the top of the world rankings after 20 years as a professional had affected his form. He finished the season ranked 11th, slipping out of the top 10 for the first time in 17 seasons.

Playing with a new cue, he won the minor-ranking 2013 Bulgarian Open with a 4–1 victory over Neil Robertson in the final, having beaten Shaun Murphy and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan earlier in the event. He reached the final of the season&#x27;s first major ranking event, the 2013 Wuxi Classic, which he lost 7–10 to Robertson. He changed his cue again before defending his Shanghai Masters title, but lost 1–5 to Mark Davis in the last 16. His Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup title defence ended when he was whitewashed 0–4 by Andrew Higginson in the last 128. He lost 2–4 to Ding Junhui in the last 16 of the 2013 Indian Open, and 2–6 to Matthew Stevens in the last 32 of the 2013 International Championship. In the invitational 2013 Champion of Champions, he lost 3–4 in the first round to Maguire.

Higgins called his form &quot;soul-destroying&quot; as lost 3–6 to Maguire in the last 16 of the 2013 UK Championship. Referring to Higgins&#x27; frequent changes of cue, Joe Johnson alleged in commentary that Higgins was &quot;searching for something that is not there&quot; and &quot;looking for someone or something to blame&quot; for his poor form. Higgins retaliated by claiming that players in Johnson&#x27;s era had struggled to make breaks of 30 or 40 on tables with much larger pockets and by calling Johnson one of the sport&#x27;s worst commentators. After the UK Championship, he slipped to number 12 in the world rankings, having failed to progress beyond the last 16 of any tournament since the Wuxi Classic in June.

Before the 2014 Masters, Higgins revealed that he had reached the &quot;depths of despair&quot; after the UK Championship, after spending months &quot;in turmoil&quot;. He also revealed that he had switched to a fourth new cue, had regained his tempo and felt that he was playing better than he had in some time. He defeated Stuart Bingham 6–2 in the first round, but lost 5–6 in the quarter-finals to defending champion Selby, despite having led the match 5–3.
At the 2014 German Masters, Higgins lost 3–5 to Dominic Dale in the last 32. At the 2014 Welsh Open, he defeated Trump 4–3 in the last 16, but lost 1–5 to O&#x27;Sullivan in the quarter-finals. He reached a third consecutive ranking tournament quarter-final at the Players Tour Championship Finals, but lost 1–4 to Marco Fu. He suffered a second consecutive first-round exit from the World Championship when he lost 7–10 to fellow Scot Alan McManus. After the match, Higgins described himself as a &quot;journeyman top-16 player now,&quot; suggesting that he no longer regarded himself among the top contenders at tournaments. He ended the campaign as the world number 11, the lowest he has been at the end of the season in 19 years.

Higgins continued to struggle in the opening ranking events of the 2014–15 season, losing 4–5 to Alan McManus in the last 32 of the Wuxi Classic, 2–5 to Robert Milkins in the last 16 of the Australian Goldfields Open, and 4–5 to Ryan Day in the last 32 of the Shanghai Masters. He defended his minor-ranking Bulgarian Open title, but lost 1–4 against Judd Trump in the last 64. At the ranking International Championship, he lost 1–6 to Li Hang in the last 64. He lost 1–4 to Barry Hawkins in the first round of the Champion of Champions invitational tournament, and in the last 64 of the minor-ranking Ruhr Open, he failed to score a single point on his way to a 0–4 defeat by Marco Fu, who outscored Higgins by a cumulative total of 412 points to 0.

Higgins arrived at the 2014 UK Championship stating that he was struggling for confidence and concerned that a poor result in the championship could cost him his top-16 ranking and his place at the Masters. However, he defeated Lee Walker 6–2, Jamie Cope 6–4 and Matthew Stevens 6–2 to reach the last 16, where he lost 5–6 to Anthony McGill. This was enough to keep him inside the top 16, at number 14. At the Masters, he faced Mark Allen in the first round. Even though he made three century breaks, Higgins lost the match 4–6. After the match, he said that &quot;I feel my form is steadily coming back – even when I&#x27;ve been losing matches I have still been gaining nuggets of confidence and I thought I played pretty well again.&quot;

In the 2015 German Masters, Higgins lost 2–5 to Peter Ebdon in the first round, but he at the Welsh Open, he defeated Stephen Maguire 5–1 in the quarter-finals, Luca Brecel 6–4 in the semi-finals and Ben Woollaston 9–3 in the final to claim a fourth Welsh Open title, his first ranking title in two and a half years. In the last 16 of the 2015 Indian Open, he suffered a sixth consecutive defeat to Mark Davis when he lost 0–4, scoring only 38 points in the match. He lost 3–4 to Graeme Dott in the last 32 of the World Grand Prix and lost by the same scoreline to Stephen Maguire in the last 32 of the Players Championship Grand Final. In the China Open, he reached the quarter-finals, defeating Dott and Trump along the way, but lost 4–5 to Ding Junhui. At the 2015 World Snooker Championship, Higgins won his first match at the event since 2012 with a 10–5 first round victory over Robert Milkins, but he lost 9–13 to Ding Junhui in the second round, despite winning five of the first six frames.

Higgins won his 27th ranking title at the 2015 Australian Goldfields Open by beating Martin Gould 9–8 in the final. Later that year, he also defeated David Gilbert 10–5 in the final of the 2015 International Championship. This put Higgins level with Steve Davis in the list of total ranking events won. Higgins started his quarter-final with Neil Robertson at the 2015 UK Championship by making the 600th century break of his career, but lost the match 5–6. Higgins reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 5–6 after Ricky Walden made a 131 break in the deciding frame. He defeated Ryan Day 10–3 and Walden 13–8 at the 2016 World Snooker Championship, but lost 13–11 to Alan McManus in the quarter-finals, having been 11–9 ahead. He said later that he had &quot;cracked under pressure&quot;.

Higgins lost in the quarter-finals of both the 2016 English Open and International Championship, 5–1 to Judd Trump and 6–2 to Ding Junhui respectively. He faced Stuart Bingham in the final of the inaugural China Championship; with the scores tied at 7–7, Higgins made three successive centuries to claim the title and £200,000, which was, at the time, the highest prize awarded outside the United Kingdom. At the 2016 Champion of Champions, he defeated Ding 6–5 in the semi-finals despite Ding making four centuries in the match. Higgins defeated Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 10–7 in the final to win his second title in a week. In the second round of the 2016 Northern Ireland Open, he made the eighth maximum break of his career and also scored breaks of 137 and 130 in a 4–1 victory over Sam Craigie. He lost a deciding frame to Selby in the quarter-finals of the 2016 UK Championship. He closed out 2016 by beating O&#x27;Sullivan 5–2 in the quarter-finals of the Scottish Open and then came back from 5–1 down to Judd Trump to win the semi-final 6–5. In the final against Marco Fu, he made three centuries in moving 4–1 ahead, but then lost eight frames in a row to lose 4–9. Higgins won the non-ranking Championship League by beating Ryan Day 3–0 in the final.

At the 2017 World Snooker Championship, Higgins reached his first world final in six years. He became, aged 41, the oldest finalist in 35 years. In a rematch of the 2007 final, he faced Mark Selby. Higgins took a 10–4 lead, but then lost 12 of the next 14 frames, eventually losing 15–18.

=== 2017 to present ===
He won the 2017 Indian Open, defeating Anthony McGill 5–1 in the final. The following year, he won his thirtieth ranking event at the 2018 Welsh Open, defeating Barry Hawkins 9–7 in the final. Higgins also reached the final of the 2018 World Snooker Championship, but lost again to Mark Williams. At the 2019 World Snooker Championship Higgins reached the final again, only to be beaten 18–9 by Judd Trump. This was Higgins&#x27; third consecutive World Championship final and his eighth overall.

Higgins surpassed Stephen Hendry&#x27;s career total of 775 centuries during the 2019 Scottish Open. He made his 775th century on 11 December during his match against Alexander Ursenbacher and his 776th against Jack Lisowski the following day. Higgins made his 800th career century on the first day of the 2020 Champion of Champions, although he lost the match to Ding Junhui.

In the 2020–21 season, Higgins reached his first Masters final since 2006 after beating Allen, O&#x27;Sullivan and David Gilbert. However, he was defeated by tournament debutant Yan Bingtao 8–10 in the final. On 28 February 2021, Higgins defeated Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the final of the Players Championship to claim his 31st ranking title and his first ranking title in three years. After his win, Higgins said that was &quot;the best week of [his] snooker career&quot; in terms of the way he played. In his quarter-final against Mark Selby, Higgins outscored his opponent 546–7 in a 6–0 victory. After the match, Selby stated that, &quot;I&#x27;ve never had a match where I had so few chances. John froze me out from start to finish, he played an incredible match.”

Before the beginning of the 2021–22 snooker season, Higgins lost a significant amount of weight by taking spin classes. He weighed stones (217 lbs or 98.5 kg) during the 2021 World Championship, but began the new season at 12 stones (168 lbs or 76 kg). At the 2021 Northern Ireland Open, he won six consecutive frames to defeat Yan Bingtao 6–2 in the semi-finals, but lost the final 8–9 to Mark Allen, despite having led 8–6. At the 2021 English Open, Higgins came from 3–5 behind in the semi-finals to defeat O&#x27;Sullivan 6–5, but he lost the final 8–9 to Neil Robertson, despite again having led 8–6. This defeat meant that Higgins had lost six of his previous seven major finals. In his post-match comments, he expressed doubt about his ability to compete in ranking finals, stating: &quot;The last two finals I really do think show I&#x27;ve not really got it at this level.&quot; Higgins went on to lose the 2021 Champion of Champions final 4–10 to Trump, and the 2021 Scottish Open final 5–9 to Luca Brecel. Even though he lost in the round of 32 at the Gibraltar Open, he won the BetVictor Series bonus of £150,000 by winning the most prize money across the series as a whole. At the 2022 Tour Championship, he came from 4–8 behind to defeat Zhao Xintong 10–9 in the quarter-finals, a victory he called one of his &quot;best ever wins&quot;, and went on to face Robertson in the final. Higgins established a 9–4 lead, but lost his fifth major final of the season after Robertson won six consecutive frames to win 10–9. Afterwards, Higgins admitted that losing the final from a position of being five frames up with six to play would leave &quot;real mental scars&quot;. At the 2022 World Championship, Higgins won his quarter-final match against Jack Lisowski on a deciding frame, but lost 11–17 in the semi-finals to eventual champion O&#x27;Sullivan, finishing the season ranked fifth in the world.

Higgins was runner-up at the 2024 British Open, losing to Mark Selby 5–10 in the final.

==Personal life==
Higgins married Denise in 2000; they have three children. Higgins is a supporter of Celtic F.C. and also follows English club Everton. He enjoys playing poker. Higgins&#x27; first child was born in October 2001. In 2006, Higgins was escorted off a plane for being drunk after losing the Malta Cup final to Ken Doherty, but he became teetotal in preparation for the 2007 World Championship which he went on to win. Higgins was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours.

In January 2010, Higgins appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, answering questions on his specialist subject &quot;Dallas&quot;. He finished third equal. In February of that year, Higgins and his wife Denise appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot; and reached the final after answering all of their questions correctly to win £30,000. They donated the money to The Dalziel Centre – a day hospice for cancer patients, based at Strathclyde Hospital in Motherwell, of which Higgins became a patron after they cared for his terminally ill father.

In a complex mathematical study conducted at the University of Limerick, Higgins was named the highest performing snooker player from 1968 to 2020, ahead of Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, Mark Williams and Stephen Hendry.

<text>In the mammalian respiratory system, eupnea is normal, good, healthy and unlabored breathing, sometimes known as &quot;quiet breathing&quot; or a &quot;resting respiratory rate&quot;. In eupnea, expiration employs only the elastic recoil of the lungs.

Eupnea is the unaffected natural breathing in all mammals, including humans. Eupnea does not require any volitional effort whatsoever, but occurs whenever a mammal is in a natural state of relaxation, i.e. when there is no clear and present danger in their environment and without substantial exertion. When a mammal perceives potential danger or is under exertion, eupnea stops, and a much more limited and labored form of breathing—shallow breathing—occurs. 

Eupnea is an efficient and effective form of breathing, which balances between maximizing air intake, and minimizing muscular effort.

During eupnea, neural output to respiratory muscles is highly regular and stable, with rhythmic bursts of activity during inspiration only to the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;eupnea&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, from Greek , from , &quot;well&quot; + , &quot;breath&quot;. 
See pronunciation information at &quot;dyspnea&quot;.

<text>Loch Leven () is a fresh water loch located immediately to the east of the burgh of Kinross in Perth and Kinross council area, central Scotland. Roughly triangular, the loch is about across at its longest. Prior to the canalisation of the River Leven, and the partial draining of the loch in 1826–36, Loch Leven was considerably larger. The drop in water level by reduced the loch to 75% of its former size, and exposed several small islands, as well as greatly increasing the size of the existing ones.

There are seven islands on the loch, the largest being St Serf&#x27;s Inch. Lochleven Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned in 1567, lies on one of these islands, and it can be reached by a ferry operated from Kinross by Historic Environment Scotland during the summer months.

NatureScot describe Loch Leven as &quot;one of Scotland&#x27;s top natural assets&quot;, due to its rich ecosystem that supports many different species of plants, insects, fish and birds. It is of particular significance to migrating birds, who use it as a stopover when flying between their breeding and wintering grounds, due to its lowland location, shallow nutrient rich waters, large water surface, and islands (which provide safe nesting sites). Loch Leven holds numerous national and international conservation designations, including being a national nature reserve (NNR).

==Flora and fauna==

As the largest lowland loch in Scotland, Loch Leven is an important site for waterfowl, with up to 35,000 birds present in the winter months. These birds migrate from a variety of places, such as Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Siberia and northern and central Europe. Loch Leven is particularly important for pink-footed geese, and up to 20,000 such geese (nearly 10% of the world&#x27;s population) may be present at times, although many geese move south from the loch as winter progresses. Other bird wintering at Loch Leven include greylag geese, whooper swans, goldeneyes, tufted ducks, pochards, teals, gadwalls, cormorants, and shovelers.

Loch Leven is also important for breeding birds, and hosts one of the largest concentrations of breeding ducks of any non-coastal site in Europe. The most numerous species are tufted duck and mallard; gadwall, shoveler, shelduck, pochard, teal, pintail and wigeon are also present. The loch is also used by birds such as mute swans at the end of the summer for moulting, as the loch is large enough to allow them to avoid predators during a period when they are flightless as the shed their summer feathers and grow new winter plumage.

The two main fish species present in Loch Leven are brown trout and perch: the loch&#x27;s trout have long been noted for their unusual colour and high quality. Other fish living in the loch include sticklebacks, pike, eels, and minnows. Some species of fish noted in historical records are no longer present: it is thought that Arctic char were impacted by the lowering of the loch&#x27;s water level, whilst the damming of the River Leven and rise in pollution due to the increase in industry are the likely reasons for the demise of the population of Atlantic salmon.

The loch supports many species of invertebrates, which provide a food source for many of the species of birds, fish and mammals. During the summer months large clouds of small flies form a vital part of the food for ducklings. Some rare species of beetle are present, including the carrion beetle &quot;Thanatophilus dispar&quot;, the reed beetle &quot;Macroplea appendiculata&quot; and the ant beetle &quot;Anthicus scoticus&quot;. Other invertebrates found at the loch include aquatic snails and several species of dragonflies and damselflies.

Otters are found around the loch and the burns that feed into it, and water shrews and water voles live along the banks of ditches and burns. A total of six species of bat have been recorded at the NNR: Daubenton, brown long-eared, noctule, Nathusius, soprano and common pipistrelle bat. Grey squirrel numbers are controlled and this has allowed red squirrels to re-establish themselves in woodlands around the loch. Fox, mink and brown rat are also present on the reserve. As with the grey squirrels numbers are controlled, for these pest species this is to protect nesting birds.

The Loch Leven NNR hosts a wide assemblage of vascular plant species that grow around the loch shore, including three species listed on the IUCN Red List (coral root orchid, Loch Leven spearwort and lesser water-plantain) and other species rated as &quot;nationally rare&quot; or &quot;nationally scarce&quot; such as holy grass, threadrush and mudwort. Lesser water plantain, Loch Leven spearwort, mudwort and threadrush live on areas of mud, sand or gravel around the lochside. They require sites that are intermittently exposed, and either natural erosion or active management is needed to prevent reeds or other aquatic plants from out-competing them. Coral-root orchid is found at only one location on the reserve.

==History==

The area around Loch Leven has been inhabited for millennia, and the remains of a crannog (a dwelling constructed on an artificial island, probably during the Iron Age) have been found off Kirkgate Park.

St Serf&#x27;s Inch was the home of a Culdee and then an Augustinian monastic community, St Serf&#x27;s Inch Priory. There was a monastic community on the island which was old in the 12th century. The monastery produced a series of Gaelic language charters from the 11th and 12th centuries which were translated into Latin in the late 12th century. It was here that Prior Andrew of Wyntoun wrote the Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland.

Lochleven Castle is strongly associated with Mary, Queen of Scots, who was imprisoned here in 1567–1568, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler&#x27;s family. After her escape her forces were defeated at the Battle of Langside, and she fled to England. Several relics were found during the partial draining of the loch in 1826–36, one of them being a sceptre, &quot;apparently of cane, hilted with ivory, and mounted with silver, upon which … were the letters of the words, &#x27;Mary, Queen of Scots&#x27;&quot;, found near the &quot;Mary Knowe&quot;, where she is supposed to have landed after her escape from the castle. Kinross House lies on the western shore of the loch facing out to the castle. It was built in 1684–1695 by its owner, the architect Sir William Bruce.

Visitors to Loch Leven have long noted the abundance of wildlife here:

In 1827 an Act of Parliament was passed &quot;for recovering, draining and preserving certain lands in the counties of Fife and Kinross; and for better supplying with water the mills, Manufactories and Bleach fields and other works situated on or near the River Leven in the said county of Fife.&quot; The work was undertaken to provide a more reliable water supply to industries along the River Leven, and involved the lowering of the level of the loch, and straightening of the River Leven: the old meanders of the river are visible in aerial photographs of the area.

==Leisure and visitors==

There is an all abilities path around the loch, known as the Loch Leven Heritage Trail, which can be accessed from seven different car parks around the loch at Kinross Pier; Kirkgate Park; Burleigh Sands; Loch Leven&#x27;s Larder; Findatie; RSPB Loch Leven car park; and the car park at the Cashmere Factory. The trail was completed in 2014, and as of 2016 NatureScot estimated that 200,000 people were using it annually. The RSPB run a visitor centre on their section of the reserve which as of 2016 was receiving around 70,000 visitors each year. The centre has facilities including a shop, café, observation room, educational facilities, toilets, and marked trails leading to three bird hides. A further three open hides are provided at locations around the loch.

Loch Leven is strongly associated with the sport of curling, and Kinross Curling Club, founded 1668, is reputedly the oldest in the world. The loch has been the site of the most extensive outdoor tournaments in the sport, the Grand Match or Bonspiel, however the ice has not been thick enough for this since 1959. The cold weather of the 2010/11 winter led to much speculation that a Bonspiel could be held, however due to safety concerns only informal matches were held on the loch. The loch is also a popular location for angling (chiefly for brown trout) and wildfowling.

==Conservation designations==

Loch Leven forms the main part of the Loch Leven national nature reserve (NNR), which covers of loch and islands. The NNR is managed by NatureScot, with the wetlands on the southern shore being managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the fishing and shooting managed by Kinross Estate. Castle Island is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, who also run the ferry to the island. Loch Leven was first declared a National Nature Reserve in 1964 and re-declared in 2002, when it was extended to include the RSPB Loch Leven section. The NNR is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

As an internationally important site for wildlife Loch Leven holds a number of different conservation designations, being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protection Area (SPA), and a Ramsar site.

There are also sites designated for their historical value surrounding Loch Leven. Lochleven Castle and St Serf&#x27;s Priory are Scheduled Monuments. Kinross House is a Category A listed building, and its grounds are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

Although greatly improved in recent years, the loch continues to suffer from a high phosphorus load and other pollution, primarily as a result of surrounding agricultural practises, which has contributed to occasional algal blooms on the loch and reduced feature condition. Work is ongoing to continue to reduce these effects, however it is thought that increasing summer temperatures now play a significant role in the formation of these blooms.

<text>The Big One is a 1997 documentary film written and directed by documentarian filmmaker and activist Michael Moore, and released by Miramax Films. The film documents Moore during his tour promoting his 1996 book &quot;Downsize This!&quot; around the United States. Through the 47 towns he visits, Moore discovers and describes American economic failings and the fear of unemployment of American workers.

==Background==
Harvey Weinstein of Miramax bought the distribution rights to &quot;The Big One&quot; after viewing a screening of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival, promising to dedicate 50 percent of the film&#x27;s income to the Flint, Michigan agencies named in the film.

==Synopsis==
Much of the film features Moore unsuccessfully chasing the heads and chief executives of major corporations around the US in order to confront them or conduct a personal in-depth interview. He is eventually able to talk with Phil Knight at Nike. The film criticizes President Bill Clinton, and other major candidates in the 1996 presidential election, for failure to address economic issues. It discusses Clinton&#x27;s betrayal of progressive economic ideals.

<text>Karl Josef Seitz (; 4 September 1869 – 3 February 1950) was an Austrian politician of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. He served as member of the Imperial Council, President of the National Council and Mayor of Vienna.

==Early life==
Seitz was born in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of a struggling small-time coal trader. After the premature death of his father, in 1875, the family was thrown into abject poverty, and Seitz had to be sent off to an orphanage.

He, nonetheless, received adequate education and earned a scholarship so that he could enroll in a teacher-training college in the city of St. Pölten, Lower Austria. In 1888, he took employment as a public elementary school teacher in Vienna.

Already an outspoken social democrat, he was disciplined several times for his political activism. His founding of a Social Democratic teachers&#x27; union in 1896 led to his delegation into the Lower Austrian Board of Education in 1897, which then led to his termination as a teacher later that year.

==Early political career==
Seitz now turned to full-time politics and established himself as one of the party&#x27;s most eminent experts on educational policy. In 1901, Seitz was elected to the Imperial Council and, in 1902, to the provincial parliament of Lower Austria. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Seitz developed pronounced pacifist leanings and participated in the 1917 Stockholm Socialists&#x27; Congress.

Seitz entered history in 1918, when Austria-Hungary was breaking down, and its disintegration into smaller independent nation states was becoming manifest. On 21 October the Imperial Council members, representing the empire&#x27;s ethnically-German provinces, moved to form a Provisional National Assembly for &quot;German Austria&quot;. In its constituent session, the Provisional National Assembly appointed Seitz as one of its three chairmen. All three presidents together functioned as head of state in the &quot;Staatsratsdirektorium&quot;. After the election to the Constituent National Assembly, that was changed on 15 March 1919. Seitz became the First President, and the other two presidents became deputies of the First President. The First President was also to be head of state. He retained the position until 9 December 1920.

==President==
Almost simultaneously, Seitz was also appointed provisional chairman of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria after the death of the party nestor Victor Adler. In 1919, his positions both as President of Austria and as party chairman were formalised.

Following the implementation of the definitive Constitution of Austria on 1 October 1920, Seitz declined to seek re-election. He left office on 9 December but did not retire from politics and retained both his party chairmanship and his seat in the newly established National Council, Seitz now devoted his attention to Vienna local affairs.

==Mayor of Vienna==
On 13 November 1923, he was elected Mayor of Vienna.

The extensive and competently administered public welfare and education programs that he implemented, particularly promoting the building of residences, were very popular, even by his party&#x27;s opponents, and they were positively remembered for decades.

==Personal life==
Karl Seitz married Emma Seidel, daughter of Amalie Seidel, one of the first women members of the Austrian parliament.

==Later life==
With the rise of the Fatherland Front in 1934 and the Social Democracts&#x27; failed insurrection against the federal government, the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party was outlawed. Having thus lost his party chairmanship, Seitz was also removed from his post as a mayor, taken into custody and released without charge a few weeks later. Even though a majority of Viennese considered his removal from office illegitimate, Seitz&#x27;s political career had essentially been brought to an end.

Continuing to live in Vienna, Seitz witnessed the Anschluss with Nazi Germany in 1938 and the outbreak of World War II in 1939. There were contacts with the important resistance group (Maier-Mesner group, CASSIA) around the later-executed priest Heinrich Maier, who was in contact with the American secret service OSS. Maier had set up an information network to receive important information and to realise political plans for after the war. In 1944, he was placed under arrest a second time and for a time was even imprisoned in the Ravensbrück concentration camp, only to again return to Vienna when Nazi Germany eventually collapsed in May 1945. Though now ill, Seitz served the newly established Social Democratic Party of Austria as its honorary chairman and a nominal National Council member until his death, at the age of 80.
