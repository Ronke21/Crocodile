<text>The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) is an independent authority established by the State of New Jersey in 1971 to oversee the Meadowlands Sports Complex. Originally consisting of Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in 1976, Meadowlands Arena was added to the complex in 1981 and New Meadowlands Stadium (now MetLife Stadium) replaced Giants Stadium in 2010.

In 2015 the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission was merged into NJSEA by legislative action.

==History==
===Sports and exposition facilities===

Over the years, the NJSEA&#x27;s purview expanded to include Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport and the Wildwoods Convention Center in Wildwood. In Atlantic City, the Authority oversaw the construction and development of the Convention Center and the renovation of the historic Boardwalk Hall, the long-time home of the Miss America Pageant.

In the 1990s the NJSEA built the New Jersey State Aquarium (now known as the Adventure Aquarium) in Camden. The NJSEA also contributed to the construction of the Meadowlands Environment Center in Lyndhurst, just across Berry&#x27;s Creek from the Sports Complex.

The NJSEA facilities are home to the New York Giants and Jets, which also serves as major venues for concerts and family shows. Since 1976, NJSEA buildings have hosted many major events, including Super Bowl XLVIII, seven games of the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 Men&#x27;s Final Four, NFL playoff games and Super Bowl championship celebrations, the 2002 and 2003 NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup Finals of 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003, the 1999 Women’s World Cup, many other international soccer matches - including Pelé&#x27;s farewell game, a 1995 Papal Mass by Pope John Paul II and countless major concerts.

The Meadowlands Racetrack, a leading standardbred racing and simulcasting facility, is home to harness racing’s prestigious Hambletonian Stakes and hosts a fall thoroughbred meet.

Historic Monmouth Park is the site of a summer thoroughbred meet highlighted by the Haskell Invitational won in dramatic fashion in 2009 by the filly, Rachel Alexandra.

The NJSEA also operates the Off Track Wagering (OTW) facility, Favorites at Woodbridge, and has received approval to open a second OTW in Bayonne.

The NJSEA also provides in-house security, emergency medical services, and fire protection staff to the entire Meadowlands Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium, the replacement for Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex built privately by the Jets and Giants, as they have done in the past at Giants Stadium.

The NJSEA owns the land beneath the American Dream Meadowlands shopping complex. It issued $1.15 billion in municipal bonds to support the project.

===New Jersey Meadowlands Commission merger===
The New Jersey Meadowlands Commission (formerly the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission) was a regional zoning, planning and regulatory agency in northern New Jersey, established by the state in 1969. In 2015 the New Jersey Legislature voted to reorganize the commission to become part of NJSEA. Included in the merger was the Meadowlands Research and Restoration Institute and the Meadowlands Environment Center.

Following the absorption of the Meadowlands Commission, NJSEA has continued the commission&#x27;s functions of managing land development in the Meadowlands district. In 2020 the agency adopted a revised master plan for the district, focusing on environmental protections and economic development.

==Governance==
The 16-member Board of Commissioners is appointed by the Governor of New Jersey to four-year terms, subject to confirmation by the New Jersey Senate and it includes three ex officio members: The authority president, the State Treasurer and a designated representative of the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. The authority holds regularly scheduled meeting which are open to the public. The minutes of all authority meetings are subject to approval by the Governor.

Its first Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) was David A. &quot;Sonny&quot; Werblin. Joe Plumeri, owner of the Trenton Thunder and CEO of Willis Group Holdings, was Commissioner of NJSEA from 1997 to 2004.

In February 2018, it was announced that Vincent Prieto, former Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly would step down from his post and succeed Wayne Hasenbalg as president and chief executive officer, a position that will pay him a $280,000 annual salary.

==Chief executive officers==
*Sonny Werblin: 1971–1974
*Jack Krumpe: 1974–1978
*Robert G. Harter: 1978–1978
*Robert Mulcahy: 1978–1998
*Dennis R. Robinson: 1998–1999
*Wayne Hasenbalg: 1999–2018
*Vincent Prieto: 2018–present

<text>The Argyle Line is a suburban railway located in West Central Scotland. The line serves the commercial and shopping districts of Glasgow&#x27;s central area, and connects towns from West Dunbartonshire to South Lanarkshire. Named for Glasgow&#x27;s Argyle Street, the line uses the earlier cut-and-cover tunnel running beneath that thoroughfare.

The term &quot;Argyle Line&quot; is commonly used to describe:
* the extensive urban passenger train service that connects the towns and suburbs of North Clyde with Motherwell, Larkhall, and Lanark, to the southeast. Of the 48 stations, 4 are in West Dunbartonshire, 4 in East Dunbartonshire, 17 in Glasgow City, 10 in North Lanarkshire, and 13 in South Lanarkshire.
* the central portion of railway infrastructure encompassing less than .

==History==
===Prior to 1964===
The Glasgow Central Railway (GCR) under central Glasgow opened in 1886, connecting the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway at and Stobcross Railway at to the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway near , Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway at , Clydesdale Junction Railway and Polloc and Govan Railway at , and Clydesdale Junction Railway at Newton. The line closed in 1964 as a result of the Beeching Axe.

===Overview 1979 opening===
On 1 November 1979, Elizabeth II officially opened the Argyle Line (in conjunction with the inauguration of the modernised Glasgow Subway), with services commencing four days later. This joint venture between British Rail and the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE) comprised a tunnel diversion and reopening the Stobcross–Rutherglen low-level line. However, the Argyle name later applied to the combined – routes.

===Infrastructure===
The former Caledonian Railway (CR) line via Whiteinch, , and (Kelvin Hall) remained abandoned. The new connection with the original North British Railway route via and a rebuilt also incorporated a grade-separated junction with the Queen Street Low Level route. The already electrified North Clyde Line northwest of Partick and West Coast Main Line (WCML) southeast of Rutherglen were linked by laying double tracks and installing overhead electrical wiring along the disused section that had separated these networks. At Rutherglen, a new platform was built and the main line ones abandoned.

Finnieston West Junction– is sub-surface:
* Brickwork was power washed and repaired.
* Concrete slabs superseded ballast.
* Former GCR stations at and remained disused. The frontage of Glasgow Green station was demolished in March 2012, and the entrance to Glasgow Cross station (adjacent to the Tollbooth) has been turned into ventilation ducts, visible from the traffic island between Trongate and London Road.
* became a new station west of the former Glasgow Cross.
* (called Finnieston until 1986) was rebuilt. Slightly to the west of the original GCR Stobcross station, the only commonality between the two is the location of much of the eastbound platform (which was originally the westbound one). A new siding enabled westbound trains to stable and turn back.
* Tunnel lengths are Kelvinhaugh (Finnieston West Junction–Exhibition Centre) , Stobcross (Exhibition Centre–Anderston) , Anderston (Anderston–Glasgow Green) , Canning St (Glasgow Green–Bridgeton) , and Dalmarnock Rd (Bridgeton–Dalmarnock) .

===Flooding===
In Winter 1994, the River Kelvin breached its banks releasing a deluge into the Exhibition Centre–Argyle Street section to a depth of more than , trapping two trains, and resulting in a nine-month closure. Dalmarnock has been flooded several times.

===Extensions===
The Larkhall Line was opened as an extension to Argyle Line services in December 2005 by First Minister Jack McConnell. Formerly the CR Coalburn Branch, the rebuilt/new stations are , , and the terminus. The branch is single line throughout, with a crossing loop at Allanton. , formerly a North Clyde service, became a destination.

The Whifflet Line service that reopened in October 1993 received electrification of the Rutherglen–Whifflet section in December 2014. This enabled a rerouting through Glasgow Central Low Level to the western suburbs, increased frequency on the route, reduced WCML usage conflict, and created a diversionary path for long distance WCML services. At the same time, Lanark services switched to Glasgow Central High Level.

===Service patterns===






==Services==
===Routes===
At Dalmuir Park Junction, southeastwards enters the Yoker line, before rejoining at Hyndland East Junction, and eastwards remains on the North Clyde (officially North Electric Main Line) via Singer and Westerton Junction, where the Milngavie Branch joins. This route continues via Knightswood North and South junctions, and Hyndland.

Eastbound trains enter the Kelvinhaugh Tunnel immediately to the west of Sandyford Street. This tunnel joins the original section on the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway from , just south of Kelvinhaugh Street; finally meeting the disused GCR Stobcross Depot Tunnel, just inside the common southeast portal of these two tunnels. The mouth of the Stobcross Depot Tunnel can be seen from the eastbound platform of Exhibition Centre.

Westbound trains ascend to join the North Clyde line from Queen Street station. This steep incline originally gave access to the sidings at Queen&#x27;s Dock from the Stobcross Railway.

The WCML is accessed after Rutherglen. At Rutherglen East Junction, the Whifflet line emerges eastwards, and the route later passes east of . At Newton Junction, eastwards follows the WCML via , and southeastwards is the Hamilton Circle. At Haughhead Junction, east of , a branch leads to Larkhall. The Hamilton Circle terminates at Motherwell.

Bellshill is after leaving the WCML at Uddingston Junction. Beyond the station, the route joins the line south from Whifflet, returning to the WCML at Motherwell. Southeast at Lanark Junction, the single-track branch serves Lanark, the southeastern extremity.


===Frequency===


==Rolling stock==
At its opening, the rolling stock on the Argyle Line was Class 314 electric multiple units, which were then new. These were accompanied by a number of the older Class 303 &quot;Blue Train&quot; sets from the North Clyde route. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Class 311 trains also operated on this route. After the 303s were retired in 2002, the route was operated by a mixture of new Class 334 Alstom &quot;Juniper&quot; units, alongside a small number of 1980s vintage Class 318 trains cascaded from the Ayrshire routes, with the original Class 314 sets transferred to the Cathcart Circle. Following the opening of the Airdrie-Bathgate rail link, most Class 334 units were transferred to services on this route. The Class 320s were subsequently fitted with yaw dampers, allowing for 90mph running up from their previous 75mph limit, which enabled them to replace the Class 334s on the Argyle Line

The Argyle Line is operated by Class 320s and Class 318s with the occasional Class 334 appearing and Class 385s covering Lanark services that now run into Glasgow Central. Class 380s used to operate the line from 2014 to 2019 covering Lanark services when they first ran into Central High Level.

<text>Vincent Edward &quot;Bo&quot; Jackson (born November 30, 1962) is an American former professional baseball and football player. He is the only professional athlete in history to be named an All-Star in two major North American sports. Jackson&#x27;s achievements at the elite levels of multiple sports have given him a reputation as one of the greatest athletes of all time.

Jackson played college baseball as an outfielder and college football as a running back for the Auburn Tigers, and won the Heisman Trophy in 1985. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Raiders and in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox, and California Angels. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

In 1989 and 1990, Jackson&#x27;s name became known beyond just sports through the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; advertising campaign, a series of advertisements by Nike, starring Jackson alongside musician Bo Diddley, promoting a cross-training athletic shoe named for Jackson.

A 1991 hip injury ended his football career, and his baseball career ended in 1994. Jackson expanded into other pursuits, including the completion of his Bachelor of Science degree in Family and Child Development at Auburn. Jackson still holds the NFL record for most runs for 90+ yards from scrimmage with two. In addition, Jackson appeared in small roles as an actor in television shows such as &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, as well as films such as &quot;The Chamber&quot;.

== Early life ==
Jackson, the eighth of ten children, was born on November 30, 1962, and raised in Bessemer, Alabama. He was named after Vince Edwards, his mother&#x27;s favorite actor. His family described him as a &quot;wild boar hog,&quot; as he would constantly get into trouble.

He attended McAdory High School in McCalla, where he rushed for 1,175 yards as a running back as a high school senior. Jackson hit 20 home runs in 25 games for McCalla&#x27;s baseball team during his senior season. He was a two-time state champion in the decathlon. Both times that he was the decathlon state champion, he built up such a commanding points lead before the 1500 meters that he never competed in that event. &quot;Distance is the only thing I hate about track,&quot; he said. In 1982, Jackson set state school records for indoor high jump () and triple jump ().

==College (1982–1986)==
In June 1982, Jackson was selected by the New York Yankees in the second round (50th overall) of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft, but he instead chose to attend Auburn University on a football scholarship because he promised his mother he would be the first in the family to go to a major college. He was recruited by head coach Pat Dye and then Auburn assistant coach Bobby Wallace alongside defensive head coach Dominic Sauer. At Auburn, he proved to be a tremendous athlete in both baseball and football. He shared the backfield with quarterback Randy Campbell, Lionel &quot;Little Train&quot; James and Tommie Agee.

===Collegiate football===
During his time playing for the Auburn Tigers football team, he ran for 4,303 career yards, which was the fourth-best performance in Southeastern Conference (SEC) history. Jackson finished his career with an average of 6.6 yards per carry, which set the SEC record (minimum 400 rushes).

In 1982, Jackson&#x27;s freshman year, Auburn played Boston College in the Tangerine Bowl, where Jackson made a one-handed grab on an option pitch. Auburn went on to win the game 33–26 as Jackson rushed 14 times for 64 yards and two touchdowns.

In 1983, as a sophomore, Jackson rushed for 1,213 yards on 158 carries, for an average of 7.7 yards per carry, which was the second-best single-season average in SEC history (minimum 100 rushes). In the 1983 Auburn-Alabama game, Jackson rushed for 256 yards on 20 rushes (12.8 yards per carry), which at the time was the sixth-most rushing yards gained in a game in SEC history and the second best yard-per-rush average in a game (minimum 20 attempts) in SEC history. Auburn finished the season by winning the Sugar Bowl against Michigan, where Jackson was named Most Valuable Player. In 1984, Jackson&#x27;s junior year (most of which Jackson missed due to injury), he earned Most Valuable Player honors at the Liberty Bowl after defeating Arkansas.

In 1985, Jackson rushed for 1,786 yards, which was the second-best single-season performance in SEC history. For his performance in 1985, Jackson was awarded the Heisman Trophy in what was considered the closest margin of victory ever in the history of the award, winning over University of Iowa quarterback Chuck Long. In 1986, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker.

Jackson finished his career at Auburn with 4,575 all-purpose yards and 45 total touchdowns, 43 rushing and two receiving, with a 6.6 yards per carry average. Jackson&#x27;s football number 34 was officially retired at Auburn in a halftime ceremony on October 31, 1992. His is one of only three numbers retired at Auburn. The others are 1971 Heisman Trophy winner Pat Sullivan&#x27;s number 7, and the number 88 of Sullivan&#x27;s teammate and favorite receiver, Terry Beasley. In 2007, Jackson was ranked #8 on ESPN&#x27;s Top 25 Players In College Football History list.

====Statistics====
===Collegiate baseball===
Jackson missed much of his senior season after being ruled ineligible by the NCAA following a visit with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which he believes tried to sabotage his baseball career.

In an April 1985 report, a major league scout stated that Jackson&#x27;s only weakness was a lack of baseball experience. The scout said that he could be one of the all-time greats barring any injuries. He had a minor shoulder injury in the beginning of his collegiate football career, which didn&#x27;t cause him issues in the long term. The scout also noted that this was his first year playing baseball and he seemed to be a &quot;do it all type of player&quot; and also stated he was &quot;the best pure athlete in America today&quot;. At the time, Jackson was 22 years old, and trying to make an even bigger name for himself than he already had in his football career. In this scouting report, Jackson&#x27;s worth to an MLB team was listed at only $200,000, much less than what he would end up taking home later on in his short-lived careers.

===&quot;Bo Over the Top&quot;===

On November 27, 1982, Jackson and the Tigers found themselves embattled with their heated in-state rival, Alabama (7–3), in the Iron Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama. Auburn held a 14–13 halftime lead when Alabama running back Paul Ott Carruth scored on an eight-yard touchdown run—and then the Crimson Tide added a field goal to make it a 22–14 Alabama lead going into the fourth quarter. Auburn responded as Al Del Greco made a 23-yard field goal to make it a 22–17 score in the fourth quarter. From Auburn&#x27;s own 34-yard line, Jackson and company began a long drive as he converted on a 4th-and-1 at the Alabama 42. Jackson, who ran 17 times for 114 yards during this Iron Bowl, continued marching his team downfield as he caught an 8-yard pass from quarterback Randy Campbell down to the Alabama one-yard line. During the huddle, Jackson convinced Coach Dye to let him go over the top of offensive and defensive lines because he was a seven-foot high jumper in high school and the other team wouldn&#x27;t be expecting it. On fourth down with 2:26 left in the game, Jackson completed the drive by going over the top for a one-yard touchdown run as Auburn (which finished 9–3 in 1982) pulled off a 23–22 victory over Alabama and coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant.

===College track and field===
While at McAdory High School, Jackson competed as a sprinter, hurdler, jumper, thrower and decathlete. His best 100-meter time in high school was 10.44 seconds, but he would later run a 10.39 at Auburn. He also ran the 100-yard dash in 9.54 seconds. As a hurdler, he recorded times of 7.29 seconds in the 55m hurdles and 13.81 seconds in the 110m hurdles. In decathlon, he reached 8,340 points. In the jumping events, he had personal-best jumps of in the high jump, in the long jump and in the triple jump. As a thrower, he got top-throws of in the shot put and in the discus throw.

Jackson qualified for the NCAA nationals in the 100-meter dash in his freshman and sophomore years. He considered a career in track and field, but sprinting would not gain him the financial security of MLB or the NFL, nor would he have sufficient time to train, given his other commitments. When asked if he ran a 4.12 40-yard dash at the 1986 NFL Scouting Combine, the fastest time ever recorded in NFL Combine history and a time that has been rumored from several sources, Jackson claimed some of the coaches hand-timed him at 3.9 and 4.0, but that he actually ran a 4.13 electronic-timed 40-yard dash at a pro day at Auburn University. He also stated he did not attend the 1986 Scouting Combine: &quot;I did not go because I was already picked to be the first person to go in the draft,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to be the first person to go in the draft, why should you go to a combine and do all of that?&quot;

==Professional sports career==
===Baseball===
====Kansas City Royals====
Jackson was selected with the first overall pick of the 1986 NFL draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he refused to play for them because a visit to team facilities that the Buccaneers said was NCAA-approved but was actually not, caused him to miss the remainder of his final college baseball season. Jackson believes that the failure to obtain NCAA approval was deliberate and was intended by the Buccaneers to get him to play football instead of baseball. He vowed not to sign with Tampa Bay should they draft him, but they proceeded anyway. He kept his vow and opted to play baseball for the Kansas City Royals, the defending World Series champions, who drafted him in the fourth round (105th overall), in the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. Shortly after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year contract with the Royals worth just over $1 million. He spent 53 games with the Memphis Chicks, the Royals&#x27; Class AA minor league affiliate, and was called up to the majors in September 1986. Jackson made his major league debut on September 2 against the Chicago White Sox, and finished the game 1-for-3. He made the Royals&#x27; roster in 1987 as a left fielder, and batted .235 with 22 home runs, 53 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 116 games.

On July 29, 1988, against the Baltimore Orioles, Jackson, batting against Jeff Ballard, attempted to call time out as Ballard was delivering the ball. The time-out wasn&#x27;t granted, but Jackson recovered to swing and hit the pitch over the left-field wall for a home run despite taking one hand off the bat at the beginning of the at bat. He finished the 1988 season batting .246 with 25 home runs, 68 RBI and a career-high 27 stolen bases in 124 games.
Jackson began to show his true potential in 1989, when he was voted to start for the American League All-Star team, and was named the game&#x27;s MVP for his play on both offense and defense. In the top of the first inning, he caught Pedro Guerrero&#x27;s two-out line drive to left-center field to save two runs. Then he led off the bottom of the first—his first All-Star plate appearance—with a monstrous home run against Rick Reuschel of the San Francisco Giants. NBC-TV announcer Vin Scully exclaimed, &quot;Look at that one! Bo Jackson says hello!&quot; Wade Boggs followed with his own home run, making them the first pair in All-Star history to lead off the first inning with back-to-back home runs. In the second inning, he beat the throw on a potential double play to drive in the eventual winning run. He then stole second base, making him the second player in All-Star Game history to hit a home run and steal a base in the same game (the first was Willie Mays). Jackson finished the game 2-for-4 with one run scored and two RBI.

In 1989, Jackson batted .256 with 32 home runs and 105 RBI in 135 games. His 172 strikeouts tied him for 10th most strikeouts in a season for a right-handed batter since 1893. On July 11, 1990, against the Orioles, Jackson performed his famous &quot;wall run&quot;, when he caught a ball six strides away from the wall. As he caught the ball at full tilt, Jackson looked up and ran three steps along the wall, to avoid impact and the risk of injury from the fence.

Before Royals games, Jackson used to shoot at a target with a bow and arrow in the Royals clubhouse.

During the 1990 season, Jackson hit HRs in four consecutive at-bats, tying a Major League record (held by several). His fourth came off Randy Johnson, after hitting his first three before a stint on the disabled list. Unwilling to pay his $2.375 million salary in 1991 to rehabilitate his football injury, the Royals released Jackson on March 18, 1991.

On March 13, 2024, the Royals announced that Jackson had been elected to the Royals Hall of Fame and would be inducted before the team&#x27;s June 29 game against Cleveland.

====Chicago White Sox and California Angels====
Only 16 days after Jackson was released by the Royals, the Chicago White Sox offered him a three-year deal, guaranteeing $700,000 per season with a performance-based upside of $8.15 million over the term. White Sox co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf stated they did not anticipate him to play all seasons while he addressed his hip issues and avascular necrosis. Jackson played two seasons appearing in 23 games in 1991 and 85 games in 1993. He appeared on White Sox&#x27; disabled roster during the 1992 season due to completing hip replacement surgery earlier that year. It was with the White Sox that he made his only post-season appearance in the 1993 American League Championship Series. In three games, Jackson was hitless in 10 at-bats with three walks and a run scored as the White Sox lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games.

While with the White Sox, Jackson promised his mother that once he returned from his hip replacement surgery in 1993, he would hit a home run for her. Before he could return, his mother died. In his first at-bat after surgery, he hit a home run to right field. Jackson recovered the ball by trading an autographed bat for it, and stated he planned to have it bronzed and placed on her dresser.

On January 31, 1994, Jackson signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the California Angels. He played in 75 games, batting .279 with 13 home runs and 43 RBI before the season was cut short by the 1994–95 baseball strike. After the season, Jackson decided to retire at age 32. &quot;I got to know my family,&quot; he said, &quot;That looks better to me than any $10 million contract.&quot;

In his eight baseball seasons, Jackson had a career batting average of .250, hit 141 home runs and had 415 RBI, with a slugging percentage of .474. His best year was 1989, with his effort earning him All-Star status. In 1989, Jackson ranked fourth in the American League in both home runs, with 32, and RBI, with 105.

===Football===
During his junior and senior years at Auburn, Jackson transitioned his focus to baseball and became increasingly vocal about his unwillingness to play in the NFL.

A month before the 1986 NFL draft, Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner and Alabama alum Hugh Culverhouse took him on a private jet to visit with the team and get a physical during his senior baseball season. Jackson was told by the Buccaneers that the trip had been cleared by the NCAA and SEC. In truth, it had not, and because the SEC barred athletes from being professional in one sport and amateur in another, he was declared ineligible near the tail end of his senior baseball season. Years later, Jackson told ESPN that he has long believed the Buccaneers sabotaged his collegiate baseball career &quot;because of the season I was having&quot;. He was so angry at the Buccaneers&#x27; actions that he vowed never to play a down for them, going as far as to tell Culverhouse, &quot;You draft me if you want. You&#x27;re going to waste a draft pick. I can promise you that.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s collegiate baseball coach, Hal Baird, told the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; that no one from either camp mentioned the trip to him, and feared the worst when Jackson told him that the trip had been paid for. Baird maintained that had he known about the trip, he would have told Jackson about the SEC rule that barred him from playing professional football while being an amateur in baseball. Along similar lines, Dye told the &quot;Times&quot; that once Jackson concluded that the Tampa Bay trip was &quot;a tactical move&quot;, it ended any chance of him ever playing for the Buccaneers.

Despite this, the Buccaneers selected Jackson with the first overall pick in the 1986 draft. Jackson turned down the Buccaneers&#x27; $7.6 million, five-year contract in favor of a $1.07 million, three-year contract with the Kansas City Royals, and the Buccaneers forfeited his rights before the 1987 draft. Choosing to sleep in rather than attend the 1987 NFL draft, Jackson found out that he was selected in the seventh round (183rd overall) by the Los Angeles Raiders. Initially, Jackson stated he would continue to focus on baseball and would not sign, but his interest was piqued when he learned Raiders owner Al Davis was a fan of Jackson and receptive to Jackson playing both baseball and football. A five-year, $7.4 million contract was negotiated where Jackson would be permitted to play the entire baseball season with the Royals and would report to the Raiders once the MLB season was finished even if it meant missing NFL games. In addition to this, Davis gave Jackson the highest salary of any non-quarterback player in NFL history, and Jackson would receive a reported $500,000 signing bonus plus another $500,000 if he returned the following year in 1988.

Jackson joined the Raiders in time for their Week 8 matchup against the New England Patriots, where he rushed for a total of 37 yards on eight carries. Jackson shared the backfield with Marcus Allen, himself an All-Pro and former Heisman Trophy winner, but eventually supplanted him as the featured running back despite being listed as the team&#x27;s fullback. Perhaps his most notable performance in his rookie season came on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 12. Prior to the game Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth insulted Jackson and promised in a media event before the game to contain Jackson. Jackson responded by running over Bosworth on his way to a touchdown near the goal line. He also made a 91-yard run in the second quarter, to the outside, untouched down the sideline. Jackson rushed for 221 yards that night and two touchdowns. He added a third with a reception. The 221 yards was a single-game record for the Raiders at the time.

In his rookie season, Jackson rushed for a total of 554 yards on only 81 carries for a 6.8 yards per carry average. He played in seven games, starting five, and scored a total of six touchdowns (four rushing, two receiving). The next year, Jackson played in ten of the Raiders&#x27; sixteen games with nine starts, recording a total of 580 yards and three touchdowns.

Jackson&#x27;s 1989 season was his best in the league. In eleven games, with nine starts, Jackson rushed for a total of 950 yards with a 5.5 yards per carry average and four touchdowns. In his abbreviated 1990 campaign, Jackson rushed for 698 yards and was selected to the only Pro Bowl of his career.

Jackson sustained an NFL career-ending hip injury from a seemingly routine tackle at the end of a 34-yard run in a playoff game on January 13, 1991, against the Bengals.

In his four seasons in the NFL, Jackson rushed for 2,782 yards and 16 touchdowns with an average yards per carry of 5.4. He also caught 40 passes for 352 yards and two touchdowns. Jackson&#x27;s 221 yards on November 30, 1987, just 29 days after his first NFL carry, is still a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; record.

==Hip injury==
Jackson&#x27;s athletic career was affected by an injury to his left hip. In his last football game, a playoff victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in January 1991, Jackson suffered a dislocated hip following a tackle. In the film &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Bo&quot;, Jackson claimed that when he realized his injury on the field, he popped his hip back into the socket, which damaged the blood vessels supplying blood to the hip. While doctors did not find proof that Jackson reset his hip, they did discover that there was a fracture of one of Jackson&#x27;s hip bones, as well as traumatic chondrolysis ( the loss of the thin layer of cartilage that lines the ball-and-socket hip joint) and avascular necrosis (death of bone tissue) of the femoral head. He would be forced to retire from football, and was then cut by the Royals in spring training. Jackson would return to competition with the White Sox toward the end of the 1991 baseball season but did not play the 1992 season while having his hip replaced.

==Popularity==
===&quot;Bo Knows&quot;===

Jackson became a popular figure for his athleticism in multiple sports through the late 1980s and early 1990s. He endorsed Nike and was involved in a popular ad campaign called &quot;Bo Knows&quot; which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, ice hockey, and playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, &quot;You don&#x27;t know Diddley!&quot; This &quot;Bo Knows&quot; marketing campaign was for the release of the Nike Air Trainer I, or Air Trainer SC, a cross-training shoe, the first of its kind.

===Homage===
The CHIKARA professional wrestling tag team the Throwbacks (baseball player Dasher Hatfield and football player Mark &quot;Mr. Touchdown&quot; Angelosetti) had a finishing move called &quot;Bo Jackson&quot;.

In 1992, the American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest referenced Jackson in their song &quot;Scenario.&quot;

In 1995, Jamaican dancehall artist Ini Kamoze referenced Jackson in his biggest single, &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper.&quot;

In 1997, Foxy Brown referenced Jackson in her song &quot;Big Bad Mamma.&quot;
Radio personality James Golden adopted the stage name &quot;Bo Snerdley&quot; in homage to Jackson. (&quot;Snerdley&quot; was a last name that Golden&#x27;s employer, Rush Limbaugh, frequently used as a placeholder name.)

Detroit rapper Boldy James named his 2021 album with The Alchemist after Jackson, as well as using his likeness for his 2021 album &quot;Super Tecmo Bo&quot;.

===Video games===
Called &quot;the greatest athlete in video game history&quot;, Jackson&#x27;s digital counterpart was nicknamed by fans &quot;Tecmo Bo&quot; since being featured in the 1991 video game &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where he is all but untacklable. Players would make the popular move of running Bo all the way back to his own one-yard line, then run 99 yards for a touchdown with defenders literally bouncing off him. Referencing his video game character, Jackson was featured in a 2016 advertisement for the Kia Sorento, with Jackson driving the car into a virtual stadium (a second ad features Brian Bosworth with Jackson referencing the infamous &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; touchdown run).

Jackson has his own video game for the original Game Boy portable gaming system, &quot;Bo Jackson&#x27;s Hit and Run&quot;. The game featured both baseball and football. Released around the same time was &quot;Bo Jackson Baseball&quot; for the NES system and IBM-compatible computers. Jackson can be unlocked as a player in &quot;ESPN NFL Football&quot;. Jackson made an appearance in the 2004 video game &quot;NFL Street 2&quot;. Jackson also made his first appearance in the modern Madden series, &quot;Madden 15&quot; and &quot;Madden 16&quot;. He later returned in Madden NFL 20 as part of the Madden Ultimate Team 10th Anniversary promo, before getting a community-made Golden Ticket card.

===Television===
Jackson was a character in &quot;ProStars&quot;, an NBC Saturday morning cartoon show which also features Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan fighting crime and helping children; though he made physical cameos in the live-action segments of several episodes, his cartoon counterpart was voiced by actor Dave Fennoy. Jackson likewise appeared in animated form in the &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; episode &quot;Battle of the Baseball Know-It-Alls&quot;, this time voiced by Canadian actor Blu Mankuma.

==Life after sports==

In 1995, Jackson completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Family and Child Development at Auburn to fulfill the promise he made to his mother.

Through the 1990s, Jackson dabbled in acting, having made several television guest appearances first on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; in 1990 as well as &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. He later appeared in small roles in the films &quot;The Chamber&quot;, &quot;The Pandora Project&quot; and &quot;Fakin&#x27; Da Funk&quot;.

Jackson served as the President of the HealthSouth Sports Medicine Council, part of Birmingham, Alabama-based HealthSouth Corporation.

The Chicago White Sox chose Jackson to throw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the 2005 World Series. The White Sox went on to win that game on a ninth-inning walk-off home run, then swept the Houston Astros for their first championship in 88 years.

In 2007, Jackson became part-owner and CEO of the new Bo Jackson Elite Sports Complex, an multi-sport dome facility in Lockport, Illinois. His other investments include food company N&#x27;Genuity. In 2009, he reflected on his business career launched upon his sports success, &quot;I was good for sports, but sports was great to Bo Jackson.&quot;

In 2007, Nike released a set of Nike Dunk shoes honoring Bo Jackson. The set featured three colorways based on previously released Nike shoes: the &quot;Bo Knows&quot; Trainer I, Trainer 91 and Medicine Ball Trainer III.

On May 9, 2009, Jackson delivered the commencement speech at Auburn University&#x27;s graduation ceremony, about the benefits of stepping out of one&#x27;s comfort zone.

In 2009, he joined the board of Burr Ridge Bank and Trust. In 2013, the bank was acquired by First Community Financial Bank, who retained him as a board member. In 2017, First Community was acquired by Busey Bank, and Jackson left the board.

On July 12, 2010, Jackson threw the ceremonial first pitch before the 2010 Home Run Derby at Angel Stadium and participated in the celebrity softball game. In December 2010, he was named a 2011 winner of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award, given annually to six former NCAA student-athletes for distinguished career accomplishment on the 25th anniversary of their college graduation.

On January 22, 2014, Jackson rejoined the Chicago White Sox as an ambassador for the team — joining the ranks of Frank Thomas, Minnie Miñoso, Carlton Fisk, Ron Kittle, Carlos May, and Bill Melton.

Jackson was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2016. Jackson&#x27;s number 34 jerseys are still sold by the Las Vegas Raiders.

Working with his brand Promise Nutraceuticals, Jackson announced a line of CBD products called Hero Brand CBD in November 2021.

==Personal life==
Jackson has been married to Linda (née Garrett), a rehabilitation counselor, since 1987. The couple met at Auburn, where Linda received her master&#x27;s degree. They have three children: Son Garrett, born 1986, son Nicholas, born 1988, and daughter Morgan, born 1989. Jackson and his family live in Burr Ridge, Illinois.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Jackson said he never would have played football if he had known the health risks associated with it. &quot;I wish I had known about all of those head injuries, but no one knew that. And the people that did know that, they wouldn&#x27;t tell anybody,&quot; he said. &quot;The game has gotten so violent, so rough. We&#x27;re so much more educated on this CTE stuff (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), there&#x27;s no way I would ever allow my kids to play football today.&quot;

Jackson is known frequently to refer to himself in the third person, a habit he has had since his childhood due to his severe stutter which made it difficult for him to say &quot;I&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s great-nephew, Shedrick Jackson, plays for the Las Vegas Raiders.

==Charity==
In an effort to help his native state of Alabama, Jackson began a fundraiser known as &quot;Bo Bikes Bama&quot;. The event began after a series of tornadoes devastated Alabama on April 27, 2011. The tornadoes claimed hundreds of lives and left many Alabama residents without power. The bike tour lasted five days where Jackson visited towns that had been demolished by the series of tornadoes. Bo was accompanied on this tour by celebrities such as Scottie Pippen, Ken Griffey Jr., Lance Armstrong, and Brett Favre. The five-day gran fondo was a one-time event, but has become an annual maximum single-day gran fondo lasting approximately 62 miles. Today, the &quot;Bo Bikes Bama&quot; campaign has raised over $1.1 million for the Alabama Governor&#x27;s Emergency Relief Fund.

In 2022, Jackson donated $170,000 to pay for the funeral expenses for the victims&#x27; families following the massacre of 19 children and two adults in Uvalde, Texas.

<text>Kryten is a fictional character in the British science fiction situation comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. The name &quot;Kryten&quot; is a reference to the head butler in the J.M. Barrie play &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;. Originally referred to as a Series III mechanoid, he is later described as a 4000 Series, or Series 4000.

In their original plan for the series, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor had specified that there would be no aliens and no robots. Following the success of the first appearance by the Kryten character, Naylor convinced Grant to bring him back.

In the character&#x27;s first appearance, originally only intended as a one-off, Kryten was played by actor David Ross but the popularity of the character meant that Kryten was introduced as a regular in Series III. The intention was to bring Ross back to play the role, but he was not available at the time and the position was filled by actor Robert Llewellyn.

David Ross later returned to voice Talkie Toaster in the series IV episode &quot;White Hole&quot; and the series XII episode &quot;Mechocracy&quot;.

== Fictional history ==
=== Television ===
==== 1980s ====
Kryten (as portrayed by David Ross) first appeared in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Kryten&quot; (1988), where he is characterised as a service mechanoid on board the &quot;Nova 5&quot;, a spacecraft originally from Earth. Kryten says that his entire purpose is &quot;to serve and have no regard for himself&quot;. He sends a distress call which is picked up by the crew of the mining ship &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, claiming that the male crew died when the &quot;Nova 5&quot; crash landed on a planetoid, while the female crew are—according to Kryten himself—&quot;stable, but injured&quot;. The female crew have actually been dead for &quot;centuries&quot;—Kryten apparently not realising this, and continuing to feed and serve them. Because there is no-one else on board the &quot;Nova 5&quot;, Kryten starts a new life on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; with the hologram Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) as his new master. Dave Lister (Craig Charles) persuades Kryten to rebel against Rimmer (which includes showing him the films &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot;) and to become independent. Kryten changes the portrait of Rimmer he paints to make it appear as though he was sitting on a toilet, and then pours soup onto Rimmer&#x27;s bed sheets. Kryten takes Lister&#x27;s space-bike and goes out to find a planet with an atmosphere where he can grow a garden, which had always been a dream of his. This episode also marks a &#x27;first&#x27; in science-fiction history in which an android deliberately gives a human being the &#x27;finger&#x27;.

Kryten (as portrayed by Robert Llewellyn) returns in &quot;Backwards&quot; (1989), where he permanently becomes part of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crew. At the start of the episode, Kryten is described in some scrolling text as being found in pieces after his space-bike crashed on an asteroid. Lister rebuilds Kryten, although he is unable to recapture his former personality. In the episode proper, Kryten causes the &quot;Starbug 1&quot; shuttle to fall into a time hole while taking a driving test facilitated by Rimmer. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s computer Holly (Hattie Hayridge) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten spend three weeks working as the novelty act &quot;the Sensational Reverse Brothers&quot; and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but are fired by a pub manager (Arthur Smith) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten become involved in later that night. Lister and the Cat (Danny John-Jules) come to rescue Rimmer, Kryten and Holly in another &quot;Starbug&quot; to get back to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Timeslides&quot; (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid to convince his younger self (played by Emile Charles) become wealthy and successful and not join the Space Corps. This consequently causes Kryten to never be rescued. Rimmer unwittingly reverses this new timeline by going back in time to &quot;his&quot; boyhood self (played by Simon Gaffney), causing Kryten to return to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;The Last Day&quot; (1989), a replacement android for Kryten is shown travelling &quot;en route&quot; to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and a countdown for Kryten&#x27;s shut down disc activates, leaving Kryten with only twenty-four hours notice before all mental and physical action automatically stops, because of his service life expiring so the new model can be sold. Kryten reveals that he has a strong faith in Silicon Heaven, an afterlife for electrical equipment, which Lister tries and fails to convince Kryten is not real. After feeling enjoyment for the first time at a party, Kryten overrides his shut down programming and causes his replacement, Hudzen (Gordon Kennedy), to shut down (preventing him from deactivating Kryten by force) because Hudzen&#x27;s android brain is unable to cope with the idea there is no Silicon Heaven; Kryten only surviving because he knew he was lying to Hudzen.

==== 1990s ====
In &quot;Camille&quot; (1991), Lister is shown trying to teach Kryten how to lie, cheat and be offensive as part of a way to make Kryten break his programming and become independent. After Kryten dates and falls in love with a pleasure GELF called Camille (Judy Pascoe)—firstly in the form of a 4000 Series GTI mechanoid, and later her original amorphous blob form—Camille&#x27;s estranged husband Hector (Rupert Bates), who like Camille is also a blob, lands in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;″s hangar to take her back and find an antidote for their condition. Kryten lies to Camille to protect her feelings and give her her best shot at happiness by convincing her to go with Hector.

In the episode &quot;DNA&quot; (1991), Kryten is briefly transformed into a human being (played by Llewellyn, minus his usual make-up) when the DNA from his part organic brain is used to alter Kryten&#x27;s entire molecular structure. He quickly decides to change himself back into mechanoid form, because he feels miserable about making fun of Kryten&#x27;s spare heads (all played by Llewellyn), the ones Kryten describe as those closest to him, and because being a mechanoid is what he &quot;always ha[s] been&quot; and &quot;always will be&quot;.

In &quot;The Inquisitor&quot; (1992), Kryten is put on trial by the legendary android known as the Inquisitor (John Docherty) to determine whether or not his existence is justified or a waste. After Kryten is found unworthy of existence, the memory of Kryten is erased, and the Inquisitor replaces Kryten&#x27;s life with that of an alternative, uncredited Kryten who never got a chance at life. This alternative Kryten is killed by the Inquisitor, while Lister subsequently tricks the Inquisitor into erasing himself from existence, causing the memory of Kryten to be restored.

In &quot;Demons and Angels&quot; (1992), &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, complete with their own versions of Kryten (both played by Llewellyn). Before the lifespans of both versions of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;s, and restore the original &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The &quot;high&quot; version of Kryten is blown up by a bomb the &quot;lows&quot; throw at him, while the &quot;low&quot; version disappears with his version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Back to Reality&quot; (1992), ink from a &quot;despair squid&quot; causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider &quot;quintessential to [their] self-esteem&quot;. In the hallucination, Kryten believes he is a half-human android traffic control officer called Jake Bullet, and while hallucinating, appears to kill a man (Lenny Von Dohlen), going against what Kryten believes is fundamental to him – &quot;never to take a life&quot;. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second.

According to backstory in &quot;Psirens&quot; (1993), Kryten&#x27;s creator is Professor Mamet. According to a &quot;Psiren&quot; duplicate of Mamet (portrayed by Jenny Agutter), Kryten is coded not to harm Mamet, and to obey her every command. In the episode, Kryten explains that &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was &quot;stolen&quot;, with the crew now based inside &quot;Starbug&quot; chasing after &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; to recover it.

In &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been lost. In the episode, a &quot;Starbug&quot; from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten&#x27;s future selves intending to copy some components from the present &quot;Starbug&quot;″s time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future &quot;Starbug&quot; fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing &quot;Starbug&quot; up.

In the following episode, &quot;Tikka to Ride&quot; (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future &quot;Starbug&quot; destroying the &quot;Starbug&quot; of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of &quot;Starbug&quot; in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered.

According to Lister in &quot;Ouroboros&quot; (1997), Kryten ended up alone aboard the &quot;Nova 5&quot; because he killed the crew in an accident, and prior to that on the SS &quot;Augustus&quot;, that ship&#x27;s crew had all died of old age. In the episode, a Kryten from a parallel dimension (played by Llewellyn) is briefly seen, when a &quot;linkway&quot; through &quot;non-space&quot; is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses.

In &quot;Beyond a Joke&quot; (1997), a rogue simulant (Don Henderson) gives Kryten access to a file in his CPU which Kryten had never been able to access before. According to this file, Professor Mamet was due to marry a fellow bio-engineer, John Warburton. When Warburton jilted Mamet the day before their wedding, as an act of revenge, Mamet created the 4000 Series of droids in his image. As part of the joke, all of Kryten&#x27;s negative emotions are stored in a file: Kryten&#x27;s &quot;nega drive&quot;. When this file gets full, it blows, just like Warburton used to.

In &quot;Epideme&quot; (1997), Kryten mentions completing his Bachelor of Sanitation course at &quot;toilet university&quot; many years prior, where he studied the &quot;lavatorial sciences&quot;. Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski (Chloë Annett) retorts that &quot;toilet university&quot; is simply a piece of software installed in Kryten. Lister has his right arm amputated in an attempt to rid his body of the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin). Kochanski ultimately gets rid of the virus by temporarily stopping Lister&#x27;s heart and containing the virus in deceased &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crewmember Caroline Carmen&#x27;s (Nicky Leatherbarrow) arm, injected with blood and adrenaline, and tricking the virus into thinking the arm belongs to Kochanski. In the following episode, &quot;Nanarchy&quot; (1997), Kryten tries looking for his self-repairing nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm. Returning to the part of space where they were last seen, the crew discovers &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; has been converted by the nanobots into a planetoid made of sand and Holly restored to his old settings (played by Norman Lovett) and abandoned there, with the &quot;Red Dwarf Starbug&quot; spent years chasing after being a subatomic version shrunken down and eventually exploring Lister&#x27;s laundry basket, and the remaining bits they did not want being left on the planetoid. Kryten orders the nanobots to rebuild Lister&#x27;s arm and turn the planetoid back into &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In &quot;Back in the Red&quot; (1999), Holly creates a new set of nanobots to bring the entire crew on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; back to life after Kryten&#x27;s had gone missing again. Included among the resurrected crew is Rimmer, after the hologrammatic simulation of Rimmer left &quot;Starbug&quot;. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship&#x27;s brig for misuse of confidential information. While on trial for unrelated crimes against the Space Corps, Kryten is also classified as a woman under Space Corps directives, because he does not have a penis. In &quot;Cassandra&quot; (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they&#x27;re a singing troupe.

In &quot;Krytie TV&quot; (1999), the prisoner Kill Crazy (Jake Wood) reprograms Kryten. After his reprogramming, Kryten turns into a &quot;ruthless entrepreneur&quot; that runs a pay TV service in the prisoners&#x27; cinema called Krytie TV, making him rich, feared and respected from hidden camera programming.

In &quot;Pete&quot; Part Two (1999), Kryten feels humiliated about being classified as a woman and being posted to the women&#x27;s wing of the brig due to him being &quot;genitally challenged&quot;. To rectify this, he creates a penis he calls &quot;Archie&quot; out of an old electron board, toilet roll, sticky-back plastic and an Action Man&#x27;s polo neck. Archie, however, subsequently escapes Kryten and Kochanski&#x27;s cell and runs amok in the prison.

In &quot;Only the Good...&quot; (1999), a corrosive micro-organism is shown eating apart &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. After Rimmer tries and fails to obtain the formula for an antidote from a &quot;mirror universe&quot; where everything is opposite, and not being able to find anyone on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; upon returning, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the micro-organism, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in his universe.

==== 2000s ====
In &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; (2009), set nine years later, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is intact; the human race is apparently &quot;virtually extinct&quot; in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female &quot;despair squid&quot;, whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, and their dimension is &quot;invalid&quot;. This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest &quot;valid&quot; reality. They confront the &quot;Creator&quot; of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (Richard O&#x27;Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they&#x27;re hallucinating, and they wake up on board &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid. Lister initially believes that Kochanski is dead as well, but two children in the hallucination (played by Charlie Kenyon and Nina Southworth) inform that Kryten lied to him, and she actually left him after taking a &quot;Blue Midget&quot; shuttle. Kryten later confirms this.

==== 2010s ====
In &quot;Krysis&quot; (2016), Kryten begins suffering from a mid-life crisis on the 2,976,000th anniversary of his creation. He loses interest in the things he normally enjoys and subsequently installs a bright red &quot;pimptactular&quot; carbon-fibre shell to his body in order to recapture his youth and gains a sudden attraction to bungie jumping. Butler (Dominic Coleman), an earlier model of mechanoid that achieved far more than Kryten, deliberately sabotages &quot;Starbug&quot; to allow Kryten to meet the Universe (voice of Daniel Barker) so Kryten can feel better about himself. The Universe also tells Kryten to remove his new suit because it &quot;really sucks&quot;.

In &quot;Mechocracy&quot; (2017), Kryten is elected president of the machines on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; after running against Rimmer.

=== Novels ===
According to the novel &quot;Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers&quot; (1989), the &quot;Nova 5&quot; crashed because Kryten washed the navigation computer with soapy water.

==Personality==
Having lost his obedience programmes, Kryten is able to better himself. While he continues to be a sanitation droid, and to enjoy cleaning and serving others, he has also become the science expert amongst the Dwarfers, often leading missions such as their search for Rimmer on the psi-moon in &quot;Terrorform&quot; (1992). The dichotomy between these two aspects of his personality leads to Rimmer naming him things such as &quot;Captain Bog-bot&quot; and &quot;Commander U-Bend&quot;.

Kryten also extends his emotional range, which leads to him deactivating his shutdown disk (DivaDroid, his creators, believes in planned obsolescence), although the crew are then forced into a showdown with his would-be replacement. His greatest ambition is to be human, and to this end he attempts to learn to lie and insult people (mostly Rimmer).

Perhaps the most significant element of his personality is guilt. When his ability to feel guilty for his actions is compromised in some way, he can become careless, rude and even aggressive. This guilt is not necessarily balanced out by a sense of pride in the good work he does – in the episode &quot;The Inquisitor&quot; (1992), he believes his selflessness was purely a matter of programming and therefore he has not led a worthwhile life. In the episode &quot;Back to Reality&quot; (1992), Kryten almost commits suicide when under the belief that he takes the life of a human (he later finds out it was just an illusion created by the despair squid).

Kryten has at least three spare heads, one of which has droid-rot (a condition similar to computer senility) that gives it a Lancastrian accent. The spare heads can engage in conversation with Kryten. In &quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot; (1997), Kryten mentions that Spare Head 3 once told him that the other heads held a poll and voted Kryten as the &quot;ugly, big-eared one&quot;, upsetting Kryten. The others take turns being main head. All of these are destroyed in &quot;Beyond a Joke&quot; (1997) due to the final step of Mamet&#x27;s joke; eventually a 2X4B mechanoid will &quot;blow its top&quot; (due to Lister wanting to put ketchup on a lobster). The &quot;nega drive&quot; which caused this has been removed, and, luckily, Kryten&#x27;s personality chips survive and get placed in a new head.

Kryten forms an irrational dislike of Kochanski when he first meets her, mostly out of a fear that she and Lister would fall in love and abandon him. However, he grows to respect her (although not necessarily like her) after she saves Lister&#x27;s life from the Epideme virus.

==Playing Kryten==

Robert Llewellyn writes in his book &quot;The Man in the Rubber Mask&quot; that before settling on a Canadian accent, he, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor considered Swedish and American. Llewellyn discovered the Canadian accent while spending time in Vancouver, British Columbia; which he describes as being a cross between Scottish and American.

The Kryten make-up was a constant source of discomfort for Llewellyn, as the prosthetic rubber mask required him to be in make-up for up to six hours. By Series VII, this had been reduced to two hours.

Llewellyn was the only British cast member originally invited to participate in the American version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, though Chris Barrie was, later, also approached to reprise his role of Rimmer as &quot;no American actor could hate themselves&quot; quite so well as the character needed. Barrie declined. In this series, Kryten was owned by the ship&#x27;s Captain prior to the disaster that wiped out the crew, and passed the three million years by repeatedly reading a sign saying &quot;FIRE EXIT&quot; in a loop. The Kryten costume and make-up was redesigned so Robert Llewellyn was more comfortable while inside it.

<text>Cardigan Island () is an uninhabited island north of Cardigan, Ceredigion, south-west Wales. It reaches a height of a.s.l., and in area.

Lying in the estuary of the River Teifi, it is known for having a small colony of grey seals. It is within of the Welsh coastline near Gwbert. It is owned and managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.

The island was once the home of puffins and Manx shearwater. A guide book in the 1890s referred to the puffins as “Welsh parrots”. In 1924 Welsh writer and naturalist Ronald Lockley wrote that there were probably 25 to 30 pairs on the island. However, in 1934 the liner &quot;Herefordshire&quot;, being towed to the breakers&#x27; yard, ran aground on the island in a storm, and rats made it ashore. Over a period of years they ate the eggs and chicks of nesting seabirds, and wiped out the island’s population of puffin and Manx shearwater, which have never returned. The wreck has attracted a wide variety of marine life and is a diving attraction. It was 45 years before the rat population was exterminated.

Today, birds such as guillemots, razorbills, cormorants, shags, fulmars and a variety of sea-gulls all nest on the island. Bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic grey seals are also often seen in the sea around the island.

<text>PhpGedView is a free PHP-based web application for working with genealogy data on the Internet. The project was founded and is headed by John Finlay. It is licensed under the GPL-2.0-or-later license.

PhpGedView is hosted on SourceForge, where it was Project of the Month in December 2003. It is a widely used interactive online genealogy application, with over 1600 registered sites as of November, 2008. On June 26, 2006, the PhpGedView site announced that PhpGedView was the most active project at Sourceforge. It was also second most active in July, 2006.

In early 2010, a majority of active PhpGedView developers stopped development on PhpGedView and created a fork. The new, forked program is called webtrees.

==Features==
PhpGedView is a multi-user, platform-independent system, allowing for distributed work on a family tree. Users can view, contribute and approve others&#x27; contributions, depending on their status. PhpGedView has several modes for protecting the privacy of data, such as protecting all data from unregistered users, or protecting data on living people from unregistered users.

Several types of reports and diagrams can be produced, which can be exported as PDF files for viewing, storing, and printing. Maps can be generated that show all the locations mentioned for a person.

PhpGedView is installed on a web server. The user can either import a GEDCOM file to populate it or build a GEDCOM in place. An external genealogy program can be used to create, edit and upload the GEDCOM. GEDCOMs can also be edited directly in PhpGedView by multiple users registered via the web interface. For each individual in the GEDCOM, a range of data can be recorded, from standard genealogical information, such as dates and places, to employment, education, religion, photos, videos, sources of data, and more. Through version 3 it worked in both MySQL and a non-database index mode. From version 4 on, it works only with a database.

PhpGedView (version 4.1 and up) supports output to GRAMPS XML file format.

PhpGedView can be extended using modules. Several modules are available: interfaces to Gallery 2, phpBB, Lightbox (JavaScript), and Google Maps. PhpGedView previously had an integration module for Joomla which has since been discontinued.

<text>Jermaine Dupri Mauldin (born September 23, 1972) is an American rapper and record producer. Raised in Atlanta, Georgia as the son of Columbia Records executive Michael Mauldin, he began his career in music production at the age of nine. He discovered the teen hip-hop duo Kris Kross in 1991. Dupri wrote and produced their 1992 single &quot;Jump,&quot; which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was named the 23rd most successful song of that decade. He established his own record label, So So Def Recordings, in a joint venture with Columbia the following year. 

Dupri has since signed artists including Xscape, Bow Wow, Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Dem Franchize Boyz, YoungBloodZ, and Anthony Hamilton to the label. Meanwhile, he worked with Mariah Carey, Usher, Monica, and Nelly to produce a total of 11 chart-topping singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As a recording artist himself, Dupri&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Life in 1472&quot; (1998), peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was supported by the top 40 single &quot;The Party Continues&quot; (featuring Usher and Da Brat) and the Grammy Award-nominated &quot;Money Ain&#x27;t a Thang&quot; (featuring Jay-Z). His second album, &quot;Instructions&quot; (2001) peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned his second top 40 single, &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot; (featuring Ludacris).

In 2013, Dupri replaced Randy Jackson as Mariah Carey&#x27;s talent manager. He co-created the reality television series, &quot;The Rap Game&quot; with Queen Latifah in 2015. He has won a Grammy Award from 12 nominations.

==Early life==
Jermaine Dupri Mauldin was born on September 23, 1972, in Asheville, North Carolina, the son of Tina (Mosley) and Michael Mauldin, a Columbia Records executive, and grew up in College Park, Georgia. Dupri&#x27;s artistic career began when he was nine years old. His father, an Atlanta talent manager, had coordinated a Diana Ross show in 1982; to the delight of concert-goers, Dupri managed to get on-stage and dance along with Ross. Dupri got his start as a dancer for the hip-hop group Whodini when he was twelve. He made an appearance in their music video for the song &quot;Freaks Come Out at Night&quot;. He began performing around the country, appearing with Herbie Hancock and Cameo before he opened the New York Fresh Festival, with Run-D.M.C., Whodini, and Grandmaster Flash.

==Career==

===1990–1996: Early career and breakthrough===
In 1990, he produced his first act, the female hip-hop trio Silk Tymes Leather. He later formed the teen duo Kris Kross (Chris Kelly and Chris Smith) after meeting the boys at a local mall in 1991. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot;, was released in 1992 and went multi-platinum due to the success of their singles &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Warm It Up&quot;, both written and produced by Dupri. He established his own record label called So So Def in 1993. Shortly after, he discovered female R&amp;B group Xscape at a festival in Atlanta and signed them to the label. Their debut album, &quot;Hummin&#x27; Comin&#x27; at &#x27;Cha&quot;, produced entirely by Dupri, went platinum with the support of the singles &quot;Understanding&quot;, &quot;Love on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Just Kickin&#x27; It&quot;, with the latter peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. During the same year, on Yo! MTV Raps, he met Da Brat through Kris Kross and signed her to his label So So Def Recordings, releasing her debut &quot;Funkdafied&quot; (1994) which went platinum. So So Def Recordings entered into a distribution partnership with Columbia Records in 1993. In 1995, he collaborated with Mariah Carey for the first time on the number one hit single &quot;Always Be My Baby.&quot; He contributed to Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Hard Core&quot; on the track &quot;Not Tonight&quot;. That same year, he produced and co-wrote singles for MC Lyte (&quot;Keep On, Keepin&#x27; On&quot;), The Braxtons (&quot;So Many Ways&quot;), and Whodini (&quot;Keep Running Back&quot;). Also in 1996, Dupri linked up with Kris Kross one last time for their third and final studio album, producing the entire album, as well as its moderately successful singles (&quot;Tonite&#x27;s tha Night&quot; and &quot;Live and Die for Hip Hop&quot;).

===1997–2003: Columbia, Arista Records===
In 1997, Dupri co-wrote and produced several tracks on Usher&#x27;s second album, &quot;My Way&quot;. The lead single, &quot;You Make Me Wanna&quot;, reached number-one on the Rhythmic Top 40 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. The follow-up single &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot; went to number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart, and the last single, &quot;My Way&quot; peaked at number-two on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. All three singles have been certified Platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A featured guest on the album, Monica, would also later become a protégé of Dupri, with her second album, &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, dropping in July of 1998. Dupri produced the single of the album &quot;The First Night&quot;, which peaked atop the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, with the album receiving triple platinum certification and universal acclaim from critics.

In 1998, Jermaine Dupri was involved in the release of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s eponymous debut album, producing and co-writing the track &quot;With Me Part I&quot;. Dupri renewed the focus on his own music career, which proved successful with release of the singles &quot;Sweetheart&quot; featuring Mariah Carey (US#126), &quot;The Party Continues&quot; featuring Da Brat and Usher (U.S. #26), and &quot;Money Ain&#x27;t a Thang&quot; featuring Jay-Z (U.S. #52), the three singles from his debut studio album &quot;Life in 1472.&quot; The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) a month and half after release. Also that year he met soon-to-be frequent collaborator and production partner Bryan-Michael Cox, as well as 11-year-old rapper, known then as Lil&#x27; Bow Wow and signed him to So So Def Recordings. The two would later part ways after only 2 albums, but continued to frequently collaborate on later projects. The distribution deal with Columbia was terminated in 2002, with Dupri switching to Arista Records in 2003. Dupri worked on Tamar Braxton&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tamar&quot; on the track &quot;Get None&quot; as well as with Weezer and Lil Wayne on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Partying.&quot; He also collaborated with DJ Chuckie to make a vocal version of the song &quot;Let The Bass Kick&quot;. He soon released his sophomore studio album &quot;Instructions&quot; in October 2001, featuring the single &quot;Welcome to Atlanta&quot;, and containing a myriad of features (similar to his debut).

===2004–2009: &quot;Confessions&quot; and &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;===

In 2004, Dupri connected again with Usher contributing to &quot;Confessions&quot; co-writing and co-producing three consecutive singles &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one songs &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, and &quot;My Boo&quot;. Confessions won Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Confessions has been certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2012, has sold 10 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide.

In early 2005, Dupri reunited with Mariah Carey on her tenth studio album &quot;The Emancipation Of Mimi,&quot; which features the massive smash hit &quot;We Belong Together&quot;. The album also featured the hit singles &quot;It&#x27;s Like That&quot;, &quot;Shake It Off&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Us&quot;. &quot;We Belong Together&quot; stayed at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, becoming the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey&#x27;s 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men on &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;. We Belong Together&quot; won Grammy&#x27;s for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song. Later in 2005, when he worked on &quot;Wanted&quot; with Bow Wow, he co-produced and co-wrote the Hot 100 top 5 singles &quot;Let Me Hold You&quot; and &quot;Like You&quot;. That December, Dupri produced and co-wrote Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Grillz&quot;, which struck atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts yet again.

In early 2006, Dupri signed both Dem Franchize Boyz and Daz Dillinger to his label So So Def after transferring it from Arista Records to Virgin Records. The latter&#x27;s album, So So Gangsta, was released in September of that year, while the former&#x27;s label debut was released the following year with the album &quot;On Top of Our Game&quot; which topped the US Top Rap Albums with the hit songs &quot;I Think They Like Me&quot; and &quot;Lean wit It, Rock wit It.&quot; The group also featured alongside Dupri on Monica&#x27;s snap single, &quot;Everytime tha Beat Drop&quot; (U.S. #48) off her fifth album, &quot;The Makings of Me&quot;. In late 2006, Dupri executive produced the album &quot;20 Y.O.&quot; by his then-partner, Janet Jackson, co-producing and co-writing half the tracklist and all of the singles. He returned for her ninth album, &quot;Discipline&quot; in 2008, producing the single &quot;Rock With U&quot;.

In 2007, Dupri produced singles for Paul Wall (&quot;I&#x27;m Throwed&quot;), Donell Jones (&quot;Better Start Talking&quot;), Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (&quot;Lil&#x27; L.O.V.E.&quot;), as well as multiple tracks for labelmate Jagged Edge. In October 2007, he published his memoir, &quot;Young, Rich and Dangerous: The Making of a Music Mogul&quot; (via Atria Books). In November 2007, he co-produced and co-wrote with So So Def intern No I.D. on Jay-Z&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;American Gangster&quot;, contributing to the songs &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;Fallin&quot;.

In 2008, Dupri reunited with Usher, Mariah Carey, and then-girlfriend Janet Jackson for their respective studio albums (&quot;Here I Stand&quot;, &quot;E=MC2&quot;, and &quot;Discipline&quot; respectively) producing multiple tracks on each. He also produced singles for Ashanti (&quot;Good Good&quot;) and Nelly (&quot;Stepped On My J&#x27;z&quot;).

In 2009, Dupri produced singles for Fabolous (&quot;Money Goes, Honey Stay [When the Money Goes Remix]&quot;) and Bow Wow (&quot;Roc The Mic&quot;).

===2010-present: &quot;The Rap Game&quot;===
On October 7, 2013, he replaced Randy Jackson as Mariah Carey&#x27;s talent manager. He later parted ways with Carey in August 2014, though they still maintain a professional relationship, as he was a producer on nearly all of her albums since &quot;Daydream&quot; (1995).

In 2014, Dupri produced multiple tracks for Mariah Carey and Jagged Edge on their respective albums (&quot;Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse&quot; and &quot;J.E. Heartbreak 2&quot;).

In 2015, Dupri and Queen Latifah created a reality television series, &quot;The Rap Game&quot;. The eight-episode series premiered on Lifetime on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2016. It followed five emerging artists, ages 11–16, who were immersed in the Atlanta hip-hop scene in a quest to become a rap star. Dupri was joined by guests including Usher, Ludacris, Da Brat, T.I. and Silentó; they gave the competitors advice on what it takes to be in the industry.

In 2018, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. This made Dupri the second musician from the hip-hop genre to be inducted, with only Jay-Z being inducted prior.

Also in 2018, Jermaine Dupri and his &quot;So So Def&quot; brand celebrated an exhibit at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, California called, &quot;Jermaine Dupri &amp; So So Def, 25 Years Of Elevating Culture&quot;.

In 2022, Dupri produced &quot;If I Get Caught&quot; with R&amp;B duo Dvsn. On 9 February 2024, Dupri released the single &quot;This Lil&#x27; Game We Play&quot;, featuring Nelly, Ashanti and Juicy J.

==Personal life==
He has two daughters; his eldest daughter, Shaniah Mauldin, with Pam Sweat, appeared on the reality TV show &quot;Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot;. 

From 2002 to 2009, Dupri was involved in a romantic relationship with singer Janet Jackson, which resulted in a brief musical connection.

Dupri is vegan and promoted the lifestyle through a PETA ad, encouraging fans to &quot;Feel the beets. Lose the meats.&quot;

Dupri endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 US Presidential election.

<text>The Meadowlands Racetrack (currently referred to as Meadowlands Racing &amp; Entertainment) is a horse racing track at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States. The track hosts both thoroughbred racing and harness racing. It is known popularly in the region as &quot;The Big M&quot;. Meadowlands has year-round horse racing as well as a number of bars and restaurants.

==History==
Opened in the mid-1970s, Meadowlands Racetrack held its first-ever harness race on September 1, 1976, while thoroughbred racing commenced on September 6, 1977. With the exception of the opening season of 1976, autumn has been dedicated to the thoroughbreds, while the rest of the year features standardbreds, or harness horses.

The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of thoroughbred racing at the Meadowlands in 1977 was noted for its use of the slogan &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot;, originally popularized in 1941 by bandleader Vaughn Monroe (alluding to the fact that post-time is in the evening – a circumstance that still pertains, although afternoon programs during long holiday weekends are occasionally put on). More recent advertising campaigns have included a direct and catchy approach to attending live racing: &quot;It&#x27;s All About Being Here – The Meadowlands!&quot;

With its sweeping curves and wide stretches, the &quot;Big M&quot; has been known for exceptional times for harness racing. Opening night at the track featured the fastest harness mile run in New Jersey to that time, 1:55 by Rambling Willie. The world record for a mile by a standardbred, 1:46 by Lather Up, driven by Montrell Teague in the 2019 Graduate, matched Always B Miki&#x27;s time at the Red Mile in Lexington. In 2023, Confederate set a new world record with a mile in 1:46.1 seconds.

The Meadowlands Racetrack has been the site of the Hambletonian, the first leg of the Trotting Triple Crown, since 1981. It has also been home to the Cane Pace, the first leg of Harness Racing&#x27;s Pacing Triple Crown since 2015 with the Cane run on the same program as the Hambletonian.

Leading drivers in recent seasons have included Ron Pierce, Brian Sears, George Brennan, and Tim Tetrick.

The track is operated by New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC with Jeff Gural as its CEO and chairman. Gural took over operations of the Meadowlands in December 2011.

Ken Warkentin is the current race caller and announcer for the standardbred Meadowlands meets. Matt Dinerman currently calls the thoroughbred meet. Sam McKee was also the track announcer until he suffered a stroke days after calling what no one knew at the time would be the last card he ever would call on January 21, 2017, and he died on March 7, 2017. Veteran sportscaster Dave Johnson, was the track&#x27;s lead public-address announcer from its opening until the early 2000s.

In July 2009, the Meadowlands Rail Line opened for event service, but is expected to run daily upon completion of the nearby American Dream Meadowlands.

Speedway Motorsports, the Marcus Smith-headed company that owns motor racing venues founded by his father, has long had his sights on Meadowlands Racetrack for possible conversion into a short track venue for NASCAR events in the New York City area. His most recent of several attempts to purchase the track failed in the late 1990s. A report issued in January 2010 by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie discussed the idea of closing the Meadowlands Racetrack and selling it for commercial development or converting it into a NASCAR facility. Governor Christie has considered selling or leasing the racetrack to a private operator or closing it altogether.

The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority privatized the racetrack, to Jeffrey Gural of Newmark Knight Frank in December 2011. The privatization included $110 million of improvements consisting of a new 2,250-seat grandstand and clubhouse, designed by CGL Architects, built on the site of the former backstretch. The existing grandstand was used as an event space for Super Bowl XLVIII.

The old Meadowlands grandstand closed for racing on November 2, 2013. The new grandstand, which cost $110 million to build and can seat 2,200, opened for racing on November 23, 2013, with an estimated crowd of 15,000 in attendance. Demolition of the old Meadowlands grandstand occurred in 2022 after hosting the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) Information technology (IT) hub and New Jersey State Police infrastructure for several years.

The Meadowlands was announced to host the championship final for the 2018 AMA Pro American Flat Track Championship motorcycle racing series, scheduled for October 6. The event, to be designated as the Meadowlands Mile, joins Turf Paradise, The Red Mile, Remington Park, and Canterbury Park as horse racing tracks that will run the series in 2018.

In June 2018, Paddy Power Betfair announced that it had partnered with Meadowlands to open a sportsbook at the track, following the state&#x27;s legalization of sports betting (as facilitated by the result of &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot;). The sportsbook opened on July 14, 2018, under the branding of FanDuel, a daily fantasy sports service recently acquired by the company.

==Physical attributes==

Like many racecourses in the United States, the main (dirt) track at the Meadowlands has a circumference; inside of this is a turf course (used by the thoroughbreds only) which is . With a span of exactly from the top of the stretch to the finish line and a distance of exactly from the finish line to the beginning of the first (clubhouse) turn, the dimensions of the track are considered &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; for an American racetrack. The main track is wide, while the width of the turf course is . The track is equipped to race at night and most of its races are at night.

In the middle of the track is a lake, intended to resemble the state of New Jersey.

The old grandstand, horse barns and site, was designed by the Philadelphia architectural firm of EwingCole (now known as Ewing Cole Cherry Brott), who also designed a number of other track facilities around the world as well as Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia (with Populous).

The new grandstand opened for simulcasting on Monday, November 18, 2013. The official unveiling of the new grandstand was on November 23, 2013, for first night of live fall harness racing. The collaborative production by managing partner Jeff Gural and The Hard Rock spans 180,000 square feet across four floors and includes a track apron that holds up to 10,000 people. Notable drivers in attendance included John Campbell, Yannick Gingras, Scott Zeron and Tim Tetrick. Famed pacer Gallo Blue Chip kicked off the racing action with a ribbon cutting ceremony across the finish line.

==Accessibility and transportation==

<doc id="625085" wikidata="Q7839753" url="?curid=625085" title="Tri-State Crematory scandal">
<text>The Tri-State Crematory scandal was a scandal at a crematorium in the Noble community in northwest Georgia that came to national attention in 2002. It was discovered that nearly three hundred and forty bodies that had been consigned to the crematory for proper disposition had not been cremated, but instead dumped at several locations in and around the crematorium&#x27;s site. This led to civil litigation and criminal prosecutions.

==Background==

The crematorium was founded by Tommy Marsh in the mid-1970s and was located in the Noble community, north of the city of LaFayette in northwest Georgia. It provided cremation services for a number of funeral homes in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, and made cremation an option for people in communities where it had previously been difficult to obtain.

Marsh was a respected businessman. He once ran for Coroner of Walker County, losing by fewer than 100 votes. Marsh also ran other businesses offering tent rentals and vault construction.

Marsh&#x27;s health deteriorated from the mid-1990s, when he suffered several strokes and developed dementia. In mid-to-late 1996 his son, Ray Brent Marsh, took over operation of the business. On May 20, 2003, during the pendency of the litigation filed against the Marsh family, Tommy Marsh died.

Between 1996 and the date of the discovery, more than 2,000 bodies had been sent to Tri-State. At some point after Ray Brent Marsh took over the business, he apparently had issues in performing cremations. It was not clear why this was the case. During his operation of the business, a total of 339 bodies went uncremated. Families of the deceased were given concrete dust instead of cremated remains.

==Discovery and identification of the remains==
In early 2002, the United States Environmental Protection Agency office in Atlanta received an anonymous tip that something was amiss at Tri-State Crematory. The EPA officers sent to investigate the property discovered a skull and some bones that were human in origin. The original human skull and bones went missing later in the litigation and were never offered into evidence.

Previously, a propane delivery truck driver had complained on at least two occasions to the Walker County Sheriff&#x27;s Department about seeing bodies on the Marsh property. The driver made a fuel delivery and notified the sheriff&#x27;s office. This call resulted in a deputy sheriff being called to the property, who reportedly discovered nothing unusual.

On February 15, 2002, investigators returned to the property, finding piles of decomposing human bodies in a storage shed, in vaults and scattered inside and outside throughout the property. Atlanta television station WAGA/Fox 5 and reporter Dan Ronan were the first to break the news story after a nearby funeral home director called the station and informed Ronan that law enforcement officers were at the Marsh residence. In his first interview that afternoon with Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson, Ronan recalls the Sheriff told him within a few hours the story would be &quot;on the front page of the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the lead story on the evening newscasts.&quot; Ronan and WAGA&#x27;s other reporters would spend nearly a month in Walker County before finally going home.

A federal disaster team was brought into the area along with a portable morgue shipped from Maryland. The team began trying to identify the remains, a process made difficult because many of the corpses were in advanced stages of decomposition. Some were little more than skeletons. Experts hired by the Marsh attorneys, Stuart James and Frank Jenkins, were prepared to testify that the methods of recovery were questionable and that the methods were made more difficult because of the lack of trained experts undertaking the investigation on the Marsh property. The experts, however, never testified because the civil cases against Tri-State and the funeral homes that had used Tri-State to perform cremation settled after a second trial had begun in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.

The search ultimately recovered 339 uncremated bodies. Of the 339 bodies that were discovered, 113 remain unidentified. DNA testing was possible in the cases where a living relative was available, but in other cases, it was considered unlikely officials would ever be able to identify the remains.

==Investigation==
===Motives===
The motives behind Brent Marsh&#x27;s actions are unclear, as it would have been far less trouble simply to cremate the remains than to dump them. During his guilty plea in court, he stated: &quot;To those of you who may have come here today looking for answers, I cannot give you.&quot; Legal issues presented in the case were novel, including the crafting of the charges against Marsh. Buzz Franklin, the District Attorney of Walker County, Georgia, created law in bringing indictments against Marsh.

In response to Marsh&#x27;s claim that the cremation oven, or &quot;retort,&quot; was broken, the oven was tested and found to be in working order, although subsequent examinations by experts did find faults. Several crematory operators at the time commented that even if the machine had broken down, proper maintenance would have kept the incinerator working, noting that most oven manufacturers have regular maintenance programs available.

On February 7, 2007, a week before the fifth anniversary of the discoveries at the former crematory, the criminal defense attorneys for Marsh revealed that physiological testing had indicated that Brent Marsh was a victim of mercury toxicity from the cremation of bodies with mercury dental amalgam. They stated that a faulty ventilation system exposed both Marsh and his father to toxic levels of mercury.

===Failures of inspection, regulation and enforcement===
The Cremation Society of North America commented in response to the case that funeral homes should use only reputable crematoria for cremation of remains, and only crematoria that they trust. The Society called the treatment of remains at Tri-State &quot;an abuse of the most sacred trust&quot; placed in the funeral service industry, a sentiment echoed by others in the industry.

Many in the funeral industry and government pointed to a lack of regulation and inspection as a factor contributing to the incident. Many of the funeral homes never inspected the crematory to learn its operating procedures, and never ensured that cremations were actually being carried out. Although the state of Georgia had pertinent regulations, a loophole in the law allowed crematories like Tri-State who dealt only with funeral homes to operate without a license, allowing them to go without state inspection. The state has since moved to tighten its regulations.

The Tri-State incident was representative of a larger regulatory laxity regarding crematoria in the United States. Regulation in some parts of the country had been weak; some states had no regulation at all, and except for EPA emissions regulations, many crematoria had been essentially unregulated. In Michigan, for example, a change in the law was sought by a legislator who was also a funeral director, after discovering that negligent disposal of a body was not a crime in that state. Further, even where regulation was in place lack of enforcement often remained a problem, as in Ohio which was unable to enforce its laws for a time due to a lack of trained inspectors.

==Aftermath==
===Criminal prosecution===
Ray Brent Marsh was arrested on over 300 criminal violations and was ultimately charged by the State of Georgia with 787 counts, including theft by deception, abusing a corpse, burial service related fraud and giving false statements. Marsh was facing a possible prison sentence of thousands of years.

Marsh was represented by McCracken Poston and Ron Cordova. The criminal cases against Marsh were settled after the Georgia Supreme Court had certified for review the defense question of whether a human corpse had any pecuniary value, an issue vital to the case in order to determine if the thefts could even be criminally prosecuted. The traditional common law holding was that a corpse does not have pecuniary value.

Marsh eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison, with credit for the time he had spent in custody before obtaining pretrial release on bond. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences in Georgia and Tennessee for all criminal charges related to the incident. He received a sentence of 12 years in prison as well as 75 years of probation in Georgia. 

On June 29, 2016, Ray Brent Marsh was released from Central State Prison in Bibb County, Georgia, after serving his full 12-year sentence.

===Litigation===
Almost 1,700 members of the families of the identified corpses sued Tri-State and the funeral homes that had shipped the bodies there, and were eventually granted class-action status in two courts in two different states. Class-action status was granted by Judge Neil Thomas in Hamilton County, Tennessee Circuit Court. This case was filed by Nashville attorney David Randolph Smith. Smith associated Chattanooga defense attorney Phil Fleissner to act as co-counsel with Smith for the class. Judge Harold Murphy in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia also granted class-action status after the filing of the plaintiff&#x27;s master complaint.

The class certification hearings resulted in certification of a class action after hearings were held in Chattanooga in front of Judge Neal Thomas. Judge Thomas, and the Oden class action, certified the numerous cases pending in the State of Tennessee as a class action. The Tennessee class action proceeded with various hearings and motions being filed before the plaintiff class ultimately decided to proceed with the class-action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The class-action in the state of Tennessee was ultimately decertified by Judge Thomas after it was made clear that the class representative, Oden, chose to participate in the class action pending in the State of Georgia. There were numerous reasons why the class was decertified, one of them apparently being that Oden, as a class representative, made an election to participate in the national class action pending in Rome Georgia. Most of the cases filed in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama chose to participate in the class-action in Rome. Two trials occurred, with witnesses testifying in both trials. The trials were open to the public, and were widely reported by the news media with numerous people testifying including Dr. Kris Sperry of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The transcripts are public record; neither trial proceeded very far before settlements were reached.

The funeral homes sued Tri-State and Marsh, eventually settling first for $36 million with the plaintiff&#x27;s class in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Ultimately, the Marsh defendants also settled for $3.5 million after their insurer, Georgia Farm Bureau, agreed to pay the settlement. After heated negotiations among the attorneys regarding the exact terms and conditions of the settlement, the settlement failed. The parties could not effectuate a settlement that would globally resolve all cases in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. The plaintiff class filed a Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement alleging a settlement agreement had been reached between the parties, and that the court should enforce the settlement agreement. Stuart James and Frank Jenkins responded to the motion asserting that the settlement could not be effectuated and that the parties never could complete the settlement due to the inability to reach an agreement to put together a settlement class globally resolving the cases. Judge Harold Lloyd Murphy of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia thereafter ordered a second trial. The second trial began in August 2004.

Bill Brown, an attorney in Bradley County, Tennessee, chose not to participate in the class actions. In his cases, Akers, Burns &amp; Hall, Brown alleged various causes of action against Marsh, Tri-State Crematory, and the funeral homes.

During the second trial in August 2004, the families settled with the Marsh family by agreeing to a conservation easement on the Marsh property and an uncollectable judgment against the Marsh family for $80 million, subject to a state court&#x27;s pending determination that the incident was actually covered by the family&#x27;s homeowner&#x27;s policy. Stuart James and Frank Jenkins, the attorneys for the Marsh family in the civil litigation, crafted a judgment that was not collectable against any of the Marsh defendants. Therefore, the plaintiffs&#x27; class filed a claim against Georgia Farm Bureau in State Court, that claim settled in late 2007 for $18 million resulting in the $80 million judgment being set aside and a settlement of $18 million going to the plaintiff&#x27;s class members. Georgia Farm Bureau was represented by Duke Groover and Ben Land of the State of Georgia. Georgia Farm Bureau is paying the settlement under a homeowner&#x27;s policy of insurance.

Much of the earlier settlement with the funeral homes has been paid. The Marsh family has not paid any amount to the plaintiff&#x27;s class.

Several claims remain in Tennessee. Claims that are being handled by plaintiffs&#x27; attorney Bill Brown and by Terri Crawford have been dismissed by Judge Neil Thomas and the dismissal upheld by the Tennessee Court of Appeals. Brown and Crawford have requested the Tennessee Supreme Court to review the dismissal of the claims. Stuart James represents Brent Marsh in these appeals and the Tennessee Supreme Court has denied the request for appeal. The cases are dismissed pursuant to the legal findings of the Tennessee Court of Appeals in the &quot;Crawford v. Buckner Rush &amp; Marsh&quot; decision.

Brown, on behalf of certain plaintiffs living in Bradley County, also fought to require Brent Marsh to testify in court on the claims that remain in the Bradley County Circuit Court in Cleveland, Tennessee. Brown asserted that it was time for Marsh to tell family members what happened to their loved ones&#x27; bodies, offering an explanation of what he did and what happened to those bodies.

Judge Neil Thomas, to whom the Tennessee civil cases were specially assigned, held that Marsh had waived his Fifth Amendment right upon pleading guilty to more than 700 felony counts in the State of Georgia. After consulting with his client&#x27;s criminal law lawyers, Ken Poston and Ron Cordova, Stuart James argued that the circumstances of the claim permitted Marsh to continue to assert his Fifth Amendment right. Judge Thomas&#x27; ruling that Marsh had waived his right was appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals with the Court of Appeals reversing and remanding the issue of the Fifth Amendment to Judge Thomas for further consideration. The Court of Appeals held that Marsh could assert his Fifth Amendment right in any testimony subject to review by Judge Thomas. No further testimony has been solicited by Brown.

Walker County, Georgia also sued the Marsh family to recover the cost of its investigation into the incidents on the Marsh property. Walker County claimed that it was entitled to recover almost $2 million resulting from its investigation. Frank Jenkins and Stuart James represented the Marsh defendants in this litigation which resulted in the Walker County Superior Court, Judge Smith sitting specially, dismissing the claims. The Georgia Court of Appeals heard oral argument and issued an opinion upholding the dismissal of the claims. Walker County, through its attorneys Coppedge &amp; Evans, amended its complaint to allege that Walker County was cleaning up an environmental hazard and is therefore entitled to recover damages. The environmental claim was also dismissed by Judge Smith, and the issues regarding the environmental claim are currently pending in the Georgia Court of Appeals.

The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled that Walker County Georgia does not have a claim under Georgia&#x27;s Hazardous Site Response Act. The court ruled that the county had no standing to bring any legal claim for environmental cleanup. The attorneys for Walker County applied asking the Georgia Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision. The Petition for Certiorari was denied by the Georgia Supreme Court. Walker County filed a motion for reconsideration with the Georgia spring court after they denied the County permission to appeal to the spring court. The motion was denied by the Court. All lawsuits filed by Walker County were dismissed in the claims are now at a conclusion.

The Tennessee Supreme Court also dismissed all claims maintained by people who are classified as non-next of kin, stating that non-next of kin have no standing to bring a claim under Tennessee law. One of the non-next of kin claims was maintained by Terri Crawford. Crawford was outspoken regarding these cases, and at one point during the investigation was employed by the state of Georgia and the federal government as part of the investigative team. She later brought a claim to recover money for the loss of her brother&#x27;s body. After consideration by the Tennessee Court of Appeals and review by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Crawford&#x27;s claim was ultimately dismissed by Judge Neil Thomas pursuant to the order of the Tennessee Court of Appeals and the order of the Tennessee Supreme Court denying any further appeal on behalf of Crawford. Under Tennessee law, non-next of kin may not bring a claim under the circumstances as alleged by plaintiffs across the state of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama; only next of kin may maintain a claim. The Tennessee Court of Appeals outlined a succession of who may be a next of kin depending on which next of kin survives the deceased. The ruling of the Court of Appeals resulted in a dismissal of numerous non-next of kin cases.

However, several claims were maintained in Bradley County. Bill Brown, the attorney for some claimants who are classified as next-of-kin or persons who have a contract right, fought to have Brent Marsh testify in deposition. Stuart James, the attorney for Brent Marsh, resisted the deposition, asserting that the Fifth Amendment right is still available to Marsh due to the circumstances of the case. The issue involving whether Marsh still may maintain his Fifth Amendment right was appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals sent the case back for further consideration by Judge Neil Thomas on whether the Fifth Amendment is still available to Marsh, and ruled that Marsh did not have a blanket loss of his Fifth Amendment right and that the trial court should review the right on a question by question basis to see if the right is still available to Marsh. The legal issues continue in these cases, and there may be issues that will take the cases back into the appellate court system of Tennessee.

The cases in Tennessee have been on appeal on issues relating to who may bring a claim and on Fifth Amendment issues. Many of the claims are dismissed, but some remain in the issues of law surrounding the claims are still very much alive and under legal debate. All of the claims pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia are resolved. The remainder of claims pending in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama have either been dismissed or resolved. This case throughout its pendency in both civil and criminal courts presented unique legal arguments and challenges for the attorneys involved in the litigation. Attorneys examined documentation that was gathered in the criminal investigation that exceeded 100,000 pages of documents, revealing methods of identification, the methodology used in investigating the claim, videos of the investigation, and numerous photographs. At one point a skull and an arm were discovered in the criminal files, both with human tissue on them. Prosecutors stated that the skull and arm were intentionally a part of the files, but after they were discovered the skull and arm were quickly removed.

In the end, all parties felt that they reached fair settlement of the litigation which included settlements of the class action cases, most of the individual cases, the criminal cases relating to identified bodies, leaving only a few claims in Bradley County.

===Property===
As part of the settlement reached, by spring 2005 all buildings on the Tri-State property were razed. The property will remain in a trust so that it will be preserved in peace and dignity as a secluded memorial to those whose remains were mistreated, and to prevent crematory operations or other inappropriate activities from ever taking place there. The public does not have access to the land, and the land remains titled in the Marsh family name.

==In popular culture==
The Tri-State Crematory incident was used as the basis for a &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent season 2&quot; episode &quot;Dead&quot; starring Kathryn Erbe, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and guest actor Jim Gaffigan. The case was also the backdrop for the 2011 film &quot;Sahkanaga&quot;, a fictionalized account of the events by American filmmaker John Henry Summerour, and provided inspiration for the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;&quot;.

Brent Hendricks&#x27; memoir, &quot;A Long Day at the End of the World: A Story of Desecration and Revelation in the Deep South&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2013), traces his quest to discover whether his father&#x27;s remains were among those discovered at the crematory.

<text>Lake Tonawanda was a prehistoric lake that existed approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age, in Western New York, United States.

The lake existed on the southern (upper) side of the Niagara Escarpment east of the present course of the Niagara River between Early Lake Erie to the south and Glacial Lake Iroquois (the ancestor of Lake Ontario) to the north. During the retreat of the glaciers, the water levels of the Great Lakes were higher. Lake Tonawanda was created and fed by the elevated waters of Lake Erie. Lake Tonawanda itself was drained into Lake Ontario by a series of falls over the escarpment, including one at present day Lockport, New York.

The lake evaporated when the waters of Lake Erie dropped below the level of the feeder streams to the lake. Subsequently Lake Erie drained over the escarpment entirely through Niagara Falls, which marks roughly the western terminus of the former lake bed.

The remains of the previous falls, which rivaled Niagara Falls in grandeur, can be seen along the escarpment. The sinking of homes in the lakebed has been an ongoing problem in communities such as Amherst, New York.

<text>Shirley Valentine is a one-character play by Willy Russell. Taking the form of a monologue by a middle-aged, working class Liverpool housewife, it focuses on her life before and after a transforming holiday abroad.

==Plot==
Wondering what has happened to her youth and feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley feels as if her family treats her more like a servant and she finds herself regularly alone and talking to the wall while preparing an evening meal of &quot;chips and egg&quot; for her emotionally distant husband. When her best friend wins a competition for two to Greece, she packs her bags, leaves a note on the cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England. She finds so much happiness, in fact, that when the vacation is over she decides not to return, ditching her friend at the airport and going back to the hotel where she&#x27;d been staying to ask for a job and to live a newly self-confident life in which she is at last true to herself.

==Productions==
Commissioned by the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the play premiered in 1986, with Noreen Kershaw directed by Glen Walford. At one point during the run Kershaw suffered from appendicitis. With no understudy, Russell himself played Shirley for three weeks. Two years later it opened in London&#x27;s West End at the Vaudeville Theatre, with Pauline Collins directed by Simon Callow. After eight previews, the Broadway production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 324 performances. Ellen Burstyn replaced Collins later in the run, and Loretta Swit starred in a US national tour in 1995.

From 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Meera Syal played Shirley in the production&#x27;s first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory production ran at the Trafalgar Studios from 20 July – 30 October 2010. Meera Syal reprised her role as Shirley; this production was adapted and broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010 and 2017.

A 30th Anniversary Tour, starring Jodie Prenger ran in the UK from March 2017 to November 2017. Prenger was met with rave reviews.

A resetting of the play to Accrington, Lancashire with Willy Russell’s permission was reset and performed by Mina Anwar at Bolton Library in 2020 directed by Lotte Wakeham. This sell out show will be revived at Bolton Octagon, The Duke’s Theatre Lancaster and The Grand Theatre Blackpool from February 2025. 

A new production starring Sheridan Smith, and directed by Matthew Dunster opened at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, London, in February 2023 and ran until 3 June 2023.

In March 2025, the play will return to the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool as part of the theatre&#x27;s 60th birthday celebrations with Helen Carter playing Shirley and directed by Stephen Fletcher.

<doc id="625094" wikidata="Q2629341" url="?curid=625094" title="David Bawden">
<text>David Allen Bawden (September 22, 1959 – August 2, 2022), who took the name Pope Michael I, was an American conclavist claimant to the papacy. Bawden believed that the Catholic Church had apostatized from the Catholic faith since Vatican II, and that there had been no legitimate popes elected since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958. In 1990 he was elected pope by a group of six laypeople, including himself and his parents. In 2011, he was ordained a priest and consecrated a bishop by an Independent Catholic bishop.

== Early life and education ==

Bawden was born in 1959 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Clara ( Barton) and Kennett Bawden. He attended elementary school and high school in Oklahoma City. He had one brother. 

Bawden&#x27;s parents were traditionalist Catholics who rejected Vatican II. In the mid-1970s, he and his family became followers of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). Bawden entered the SSPX seminary in Écône, Switzerland, in 1977, then transferred to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Priory in Armada, Michigan. He was dismissed in 1978. His family subsequently moved to St. Marys, Kansas, where the SSPX ran Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and College. Bawden worked for the school and his brother attended it. In 1981 Bawden broke with the SSPX. Prior to claiming the papacy, he worked as a real estate agent and furniture maker.

== Claim to the papacy ==

Bawden believed that all the popes since the death of Pope Pius XII on October 9, 1958, were modernists, heretics, and apostates, and that their elections were invalid. On July 16, 1990, Bawden, his parents, and three other laypeople held a papal conclave at the Bawden family&#x27;s thrift store in Belvue, Kansas. Bawden, then aged 30, was elected pope. He styled himself &quot;Michael I&quot; after Saint Michael the Archangel. Bawden had invited hundreds of Independent Catholic bishops and sedevacantists to the election, but none attended. As Bawden was not ordained until 2011, he was unable to celebrate Mass or confect the sacraments as a priest.

==Later years and death==

After the election, Bawden continued living at home with his parents. In 1993, they relocated to Delia, Kansas. His father died in 1995. Bawden established a presence on the internet as an alternative claimant to the papacy; in 2009 he stated that he had approximately 30 &quot;solid followers&quot;. He supported himself through donations and by republishing out-of-print religious literature. In 2010, the independent filmmaker Adam Fairholm released a feature-length documentary about him, &quot;Pope Michael&quot;.

Bawden announced that he had been ordained a priest and then consecrated a bishop on December 11, 2011, by an Independent Catholic &quot;episcopus vagans&quot;, Bishop Robert Biarnesen of the Duarte-Costa and Old Catholic episcopal lineages. Bawden said that he was able to validly celebrate Catholic sacraments, offer the Mass, ordain other men to the priesthood, and consecrate them as bishops, since he believed that the Duarte-Costa and Old Catholic lineages were recognized as valid by the Catholic Church.

In a 2022 interview released posthumously, Bawden said that his church had grown to more than 100 members.

On July 10, 2022, his church&#x27;s Twitter account posted that Bawden had to have emergency surgery and was in a coma. Bawden died on August 2, 2022, in Kansas City, Missouri.

On July 29, 2023, some of his followers elected Rogelio Martinez, a bishop from the Philippines, as his successor. He took the name Michael II.

<text>The Fifth Military District of the U.S. Army was one of five temporary administrative units of the U.S. War Department that existed in the American South from 1867 to 1870. The district was stipulated by the Reconstruction Acts during the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War. It covered the states of Texas and Louisiana. 

General Philip Sheridan served as its first military governor, enforcing the Reconstruction Acts and removing some Confederate sympathizers from office. This outraged U.S. President Andrew Johnson, who ordered his removal from the Fifth in August 1867. His replacement was the Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, who undid much of Sheridan&#x27;s work.

In the three months between Sheridan&#x27;s removal and Hancock&#x27;s arrival in New Orleans, the Fifth was led by two interim commanders: Charles Griffin until his death from yellow fever, then Joseph A. Mower.

When Ulysses S. Grant took office in March 1869, he replaced Hancock with Joseph J. Reynolds, who commanded the Fifth until Texas was readmitted to the Union on March 30, 1870, and military control ended.

Several incidents were committed against black federal soldiers at Fort Brown in Brownsville, Texas, and elsewhere by Jayhawkers, Natives, desperados, etc. Most incident reports fail to identify the perpetrators.

==Units==
Among the United States Army forces stationed in Texas were the U.S. 1st Artillery, the 4th, 6th and 9th Cavalry Regiments, and the 15th, 17th, 20th, 25th and 41st Infantry Regiments.

The &quot;U.S. Military Post Returns 1809-1916&quot;, archived by NARA, shows monthly post reports were filed for the U.S. 35th Infantry Regiment stationed in San Antonio, TX from about Dec. 1866 to mid-1870. It was commanded most of the time by Brigadier General (Brevet) John S. Mason.

<text>In Buddhism, upaya (Sanskrit: उपाय, , &quot;expedient means&quot;, &quot;pedagogy&quot;) is an aspect of guidance along the Buddhist paths to liberation where a conscious, voluntary action &quot;is driven by an incomplete reasoning&quot; about its direction. Upaya is often used with &quot;kaushalya&quot; (कौशल्य, &quot;cleverness&quot;), &quot;upaya-kaushalya&quot; meaning &quot;skill in means&quot;.

Upaya-kaushalya is a concept emphasizing that practitioners may use their own specific methods or techniques that fit the situation in order to gain enlightenment. The implication is that even if a technique, view, etc., is not ultimately &quot;true&quot; in the highest sense, it may still be an &quot;expedient&quot; practice to perform or view to hold; i.e., it may bring the practitioner closer to the true realization in a similar way. The exercise of skill to which it refers, the ability to adapt one&#x27;s message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.

The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism notes that rendering the Chinese term &quot;fāngbiàn&quot; into English as &#x27;skillful&#x27; or as &#x27;expedient&#x27; is often difficult, because the connotations shift according to the context as (1) the teaching being something to marvel at — the fact that the Buddha can present these difficult truths in everyday language (thus, skillful), yet that (2) they are teachings of a lower order as compared to the ultimate truth, and are far removed from reflecting reality, and are a kind of &#x27;stopgap&#x27; measure (thus, expedient).

==Role and function of Upaya==

One consequence of this is that it is possible to endorse a form of Buddhist practice as viable while simultaneously critiquing its premises or contrasting it unfavorably to another, higher practice. In some Mahayana texts, such as the Lotus Sutra, this is used as a polemic device against prior Buddhist traditions; it is said that the Buddha gave them various upayas rather than revealing the ultimate truth, for which they were not ready.

Gregory frames the hermeneutical classification of Buddhist schools (Chinese &quot;pànjiào&quot; 判教 &quot;doctrinal classification&quot;) as an &quot;expedient means:&quot;

The doctrine of expedient means provided the main hermeneutical device by which Chinese Buddhists systematically ordered the Buddha&#x27;s teachings in their classificatory schemes. It enabled them to arrange the teachings in such a way that each teaching served as an expedient measure to overcome the particular shortcoming of the teaching that preceded it while, at the same time, pointing to the teaching that was to supersede it. In this fashion a hierarchical progression of teachings could be constructed, starting with the most elementary and leading to the most profound.
The most important concept in skill in means is the use, guided by wisdom and compassion, of a specific teaching (means) geared to the particular audience taught. Edward Conze, in &quot;A Short History Of Buddhism&quot;, says &quot;&#x27;Skill in means&#x27; is the ability to bring out the spiritual potentialities of different people by statements or actions which are adjusted to their needs and adapted to their capacity for comprehension.&quot;

The concept of skillfulness is prominent in Mahayana Buddhism with regards to the actions of a bodhisattva. The idea is that a bodhisattva or practitioner may use any expedient methods in order to help ease the suffering of people, introduce them to the dharma, or help them on their road to nirvana. In chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha describes how the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara changes his form to meet the needs of the student. If a monk is needed, the Bodhisattva becomes a monk for example.

This doctrine is sometimes used to explain some of the otherwise strange or unorthodox behavior or &#x27;crazy wisdom&#x27; (Tib.: yeshe chölwa) engaged in by some Buddhists and exemplified in the conduct of the Tibetan Mahasiddha. Skillful means may theoretically be used by different buddhist groups to make many seemingly proscribed practices, such as violence, theft, and sexuality be employed as skillful. The use of harsh violence to one&#x27;s disciples has occasionally been used as a way of opening their eyes to the nature of self and suffering; an example is the story of a Zen priest who ended a conversation with a disciple by slamming shut a door on the disciple&#x27;s leg, fracturing the leg and, according to the story, causing a deep insight in the disciple. There are a number of other stories of Buddhist saints and bodhisattvas taking part in fairly eccentric and unusual behaviors in the practice of skillful means.

The practices and rituals of Vajrayana Buddhism are also often interpreted as a process of skillful means. They are understood to be means whereby practitioners use the very misconceptions and properties of mundane existence to help themselves reach enlightenment.

==Images and examples==
Buddhist texts metaphorically explain the &quot;upaya&quot; concept through illustrations such as a burning house and an empty fist.

===Parable of the burning house===
The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; contains a famous &quot;upaya&quot; story about using the expedient means of white lies to rescue children from a burning building. Note that this parable describes three &quot;yana&quot; &quot;vehicles; carts&quot; drawn by goats, deer, and oxen, which is a Mahayanist wordplay upon classifying the Sutrayana Schools of Buddhism into the Hearer&#x27;s Vehicle (Sravakayana), Solitary Conqueror&#x27;s Vehicle (Pratyekabuddhayana), and the Great Vehicle (Mahayana).

Gautama Buddha elucidates &quot;upaya&quot; to his disciple Shariputra.
&quot;Shariputra, suppose that in a certain town in a certain country there was a very rich man. He was far along in years and his wealth was beyond measure. He had many fields, houses and menservants. His own house was big and rambling, but it had only one gate. A great many people—a hundred, two hundred, perhaps as many as five hundred—lived in the house. The halls and rooms were old and decaying, the walls crumbling, the pillars rotten at their base, and the beams and rafters crooked and aslant. At that time a fire suddenly broke out on all sides, spreading through the rooms of the house. The sons of the rich man, ten, twenty perhaps thirty, were inside the house. When the rich man saw the huge flames leaping up on every side, he was greatly alarmed and fearful and thought to himself, I can escape to safety through the flaming gate, but my sons are inside the burning house enjoying themselves and playing games, unaware, unknowing, without alarm or fear. The fire is closing in on them, suffering and pain threaten them, yet their minds have no sense of loathing or peril and they do not think of trying to escape!

&quot;Shariputra, this rich man thought to himself, I have strength in my body and arms. I can wrap them in a robe or place them on a bench and carry them out of the house. And then again he thought, this house has only one gate, and moreover it is narrow and small. My sons are very young, they have no understanding, and they love their games, being so engrossed in them that they are likely to be burned in the fire. I must explain to them why I am fearful and alarmed. The house is already in flames and I must get them out quickly and not let them be burned up in the fire! Having thought in this way, he followed his plan and called to all his sons, saying, &#x27;You must come out at once!&quot; But though the father was moved by pity and gave good words of instruction, the sons were absorbed in their games and unwilling to heed them. They had no alarm, no fright, and in the end no mind to leave the house. Moreover, they did not understand what the fire was, what the house was, what the danger was. They merely raced about this way and that in play and looked at their father without heeding him.

&quot;At that time the rich man had this thought: the house is already in flames from this huge fire. If I and my sons do not get out at once, we are certain to be burned. I must now invent some expedient means that will make it possible for the children to escape harm. The father understood his sons and knew what various toys and curious objects each child customarily liked and what would delight them. And so he said to them, &#x27;The kind of playthings you like are rare and hard to find. If you do not take them when you can, you will surely regret it later. For example, things like these goat-carts, deer-carts and ox-carts. They are outside the gate now where you can play with them. So you must come out of this burning house at once. Then whatever ones you want, I will give them all to you!&#x27; &quot;At that time, when the sons heard their father telling them about these rare playthings, because such things were just what they had wanted, each felt emboldened in heart and, pushing and shoving one another, they all came wildly dashing out of the burning house.
The father subsequently presents each of his sons with a large bejeweled carriage drawn by a pure white ox. When the Buddha asks Shariputra whether the father was guilty of falsehood, he answers.
&quot;No, World-Honored One. This rich man simply made it possible for his sons to escape the peril of fire and preserve their lives. He did not commit a falsehood. Why do I say this? Because if they were able to preserve their lives, then they had already obtained a plaything of sorts. And how much more so when, through an expedient means, they are rescued from that burning house!&quot; 
The Buddha explains his similes of the father representing a compassionate Tathāgata who is like &quot;a father to all the world&quot;, and the sons representing humans who are &quot;born into the threefold world, a burning house, rotten, and old&quot;.
&quot;Shariputra, that rich man first used three types of carriages to entice his sons, but later he gave them just the large carriage adorned with jewels, the safest, most comfortable kind of all. Despite this, that rich man was not guilty of falsehood. The Tathagata does the same, and he is without falsehood. First he preaches the three vehicles to attract and guide living beings, but later he employs just the Great Vehicle to save them. Why? The Tathagata possesses measureless wisdom, power, freedom from fear, the storehouse of the Dharma. He is capable of giving to all living beings the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. But not all of them are capable of receiving it. Shariputra, for this reason you should understand that the Buddhas employ the power of expedient means. And because they do so, they make distinctions in the one Buddha vehicle and preach it as three.&quot; 

===The empty fist===
Another common metaphor for &quot;upaya&quot; is that of &quot;the empty fist&quot;. A father holds up his empty fist saying there is something inside it to get the attention of the crying children. Sometimes the fist is holding golden leaves to give the impression that something made of gold is held inside. This is a favorite image of Zen teachers as it eloquently expresses in image the reason behind the necessity for upaya, that is, sunyata, all component things are empty. From the Zen point of view an essential teaching of Buddhism is that all assertions of any kind, even the highest concepts of Buddhism itself such as the Trikaya, are simply expedient means to bring the hearer to the realization of emptiness. But because many people are afraid of emptiness or disdain the idea of emptiness, various upaya must be used to get the student&#x27;s attention to focus on the essence of mind rather than upon the distractions of mind. Here&#x27;s an example from the Record of Zen master Linji Yixuan:
One asked: &quot;What is the realm of the Three Eyes?&quot; The master said: &quot;I enter with you the realm of utter purity, wear the robe of purity and expound the Dharmakaya Buddha. Or we enter the realm of non-differentiation and expound the Sambhogakaya Buddha. Or again, we enter the realm of deliverance, wear the robe of radiance and speak of the Nirmanakaya Buddha. The realms of the Three Eyes depend on change. To explain it from the point of the Sutras and Treatises, the Dharmakaya is the fundamental. The Sambhogakaya and the Nirmanakaya are the functions. But as I see it, the Dharmakaya cannot expound (or comprehend) the Dharma. Thus an old master said: &quot;The (Buddha&#x27;s) bodies are set up with reference to meaning; The (Buddha&#x27;s) realms are differentiated with reference to the bodies.&quot; The nature of the bodies and of the realms is clear; they are the temple of the Dharma, and so are only relative. &quot;Yellow leaves in the empty fist to entice unweaned children.&quot; Spikes of water-chestnuts — what juice are you looking for in those dry bones? There is no Dharma outside the heart [i.e., mind], nor anything to find inside. So what are you looking for?
== In the Pali Canon ==
According to Richard Gombrich: &quot;It is true that the term translated &#x27;expounding in means&#x27;, upaya-kausalya, is post-canonical, but the exercise of expounding to which it refers, the ability to adapt one&#x27;s message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.&quot;The Pāli term &quot;upāya-kosalla&quot; does occur in the Pāli Canon, in the &quot;Sangiti Sutta&quot; of the &quot;Digha Nikāya&quot;.

==Contemporary mindfulness-based interventions and upaya==

The recent rise of mindfulness-based interventions has led to debates as to just how much these short-termed programs convey the essence of the Buddhist path. On the one hand, scholars like Jon Kabat-Zinn can be viewed as having secularized the practice and hence having made it accessible to a population who would never think of trying it had it been rendered in Buddhist terms. On the other hand, critics such as Glenn Wallis, Ron Purser, David Loy and others have strongly rejected the mindfulness movement in the ways that it has become a commercialized version of the practice. Mindfulness-based interventions in schools and educational institutions have also been discussed within these contexts. Some argue that these programs must be grounded in the origins of the practice&#x27;s ethics.

<doc id="625098" wikidata="Q1233048" url="?curid=625098" title="Catalogue of Ships">
<text>The Catalogue of Ships (, &quot;neōn katálogos&quot;) is an epic catalogue in Book 2 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (2.494–759), which lists the contingents of the Achaean army that sailed to Troy. The catalogue gives the names of the leaders of each contingent, lists the settlements in the kingdom represented by the contingent, sometimes with a descriptive epithet that fills out a half-verse or articulates the flow of names and parentage and place, and gives the number of ships required to transport the men to Troy, offering further differentiations of weightiness. A similar, though shorter, Catalogue of the Trojans and their allies follows (2.816–877). A similar catalogue appears in the Pseudo-Apollodoran &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;.

==Historical background==

In the debate since antiquity over the Catalogue of Ships, the core questions have concerned the extent of historical credibility of the account, whether it was composed by Homer himself, to what extent it reflects a pre-Homeric document or memorized tradition, surviving perhaps in part from Mycenaean times, or whether it is a result of post-Homeric development. Dörpfeld notes that while in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; Odysseus&#x27;s kingdom includes Ithaca, Same, Dulichium, and Zacynthus, the Catalogue of Ships contains a different list of islands, again Ithaca, Same, and Zacynthus but now also Neritum, Krocylea, and Aegilips. The separate debate over the identity of Homer and the authorship of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; is conventionally termed &quot;the Homeric Question&quot;.

The consensus before the mid-twentieth century was that the Catalogue of Ships was not the work of the man who composed the &quot;Iliad&quot;, though great pains had been taken to render it a work of art; furthermore, that the material of the text is essentially Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean, while disagreement centers largely on the extent of later additions.

If taken to be an accurate account, the Catalogue provides a rare summary of the geopolitical situation in early Greece at some time between the Late Bronze Age and the eighth century BCE. Following Milman Parry&#x27;s theory of Homeric oral poetry, some scholars, such as Denys Page, argue that it represents a pre-Homeric recitation incorporated into the epic by Homer. 

In the most recent extended study of the Catalogue, Edzard Visser, of the University of Basel, concludes that the Catalogue is compatible with the rest of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in its techniques of verse improvisation, that the order of the names is meaningful and that the geographical epithets evince concrete geographical knowledge. Visser argues that this knowledge was transmitted by the heroic myth, elements of which introduce each geographical section. W. W. Minton places the catalogue within similar &quot;enumerations&quot; in Homer and Hesiod, and suggests that part of their purpose was to impress the audience with a display of the performer&#x27;s memory.

The most striking feature of the catalogue&#x27;s geography is that it does not portray Greece in the Iron Age, the time of Homer. By then a tribal identity called the Dorians had enveloped western Greece, the Peloponnesus and Crete, while the shores of Ionia were densely populated by a people claiming to descend from families in the now-Dorian regions of Greece. The whole northwestern part of Greece is not mentioned and it is these peoples (Epirotes, Macedonians, some Thessalians etc.) who are thought to be of Dorian descent.

Instead the catalogue portrays a loose union of city-states, mostly in mainland Greece, ruled by hereditary families under the overlordship of the High King (, &quot;ánax&quot;) of Mycenae. Hardly any of them are Dorian. The Ionian Greeks are mainly missing. This political snapshot is possibly one intended to be of Late Bronze Age Greece.

The Catalogue was an important source for solving geopolitical matters. When the Athenians claimed Salamis they cited the Catalogue of Ships which listed it among the Athenian troops, as proof of its moral allegiance to Athens.

==Catalogue==
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Greek Catalogue lists twenty-nine contingents under 46 captains, accounting for a total of 1,186 ships. Using the Boeotian figure of 120 men per ship results in a total of 142,320 men transported to the Troad. They are named by various ethnonyms and had lived in 164 places described by toponyms. The majority of these places have been identified and were occupied in the Late Bronze Age. The terms Danaans, Argives and Achaeans or the sons of the Achaeans are used for the army as a whole. In his &quot;Library&quot;, Apollodorus lists thirty contingents under 43 leaders with a total of 1013 ships, Hyginus lists 1154 ships, although the total is given as only 245 ships.

==Authenticity question==
Some scholars debate whether the Catalogue of Ships was a later addition to the &quot;Iliad&quot; from some time after the composition of the main work. Evidence for this, they suggest, is the inconsistencies between the Catalogue and the rest of the text, and also the odd way it is inserted into the poem.

<doc id="625105" wikidata="Q270178" url="?curid=625105" title="David Koepp">
<text>David Koepp (; born June 9, 1963) is an American screenwriter and director. He is the ninth most successful screenwriter of all time in terms of U.S. box office receipts with a total gross of over $2.3 billion. Koepp has achieved both critical and commercial success in a wide variety of genres: thriller, science fiction, comedy, action, drama, crime, superhero, horror, adventure, and fantasy.

Some of his best-known screenplays include the Steven Spielberg-directed &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997), &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008). Other works include the crime film &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993); the action spy films &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; (2014); the superhero film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002); and another &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, &quot;The Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023). Koepp has also directed seven feature films over the course of his career: &quot;The Trigger Effect&quot; (1996), &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; (1999), &quot;Secret Window&quot; (2004), &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (2008), &quot;Premium Rush&quot; (2012), &quot;Mortdecai&quot; (2015), and &quot;You Should Have Left&quot; (2020).

==Early life and education==
Koepp was born in Pewaukee, Wisconsin as the youngest of four children, to Donald Koepp, who owned a billboard company, and a family therapist mother. While attending Kettle Moraine High School in Wales, Wisconsin, he worked evenings and weekends at the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Delafield. Originally studying to become an actor, first at the University of Minnesota for a year and afterwards at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for two years, he enrolled in the film school of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1984. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in film from UCLA in 1990.

==Career==
As a writer, Koepp worked on blockbuster Hollywood films such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; with Steven Spielberg, &quot;&quot; with Brian De Palma and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; with Sam Raimi. He had a cameo appearance as the &quot;Unlucky Bastard&quot;, a minor character devoured by a &quot;T. rex&quot; roaming San Diego in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, which he co-wrote and was second unit director of. Although Koepp did not write &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, he did devise the film&#x27;s basic storyline. Koepp later declined an offer to write a script for the series&#x27; fourth film, &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, as he felt he had nothing left to contribute to the series.

Koepp was reportedly paid $4,000,000 for his &quot;Panic Room&quot; screenplay. He wrote the screenplay for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; for Spielberg and George Lucas and co-wrote and directed 2008&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Town&quot; starring Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear.

Koepp&#x27;s work as a director has not had quite the same box office success. His films include &quot;Secret Window&quot;, &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;, and &quot;The Trigger Effect&quot;.

Koepp has also worked in television, creating the 2002 series &quot;Hack&quot; starring David Morse.

In 2012, Koepp directed &quot;Premium Rush&quot;, which he co-wrote with John Kamps. In an August 2011 lawsuit, Joe Quirk, the author of the 1998 novel &quot;The Ultimate Rush&quot;, accused Koepp and the makers of &quot;Premium Rush&quot; of copyright infringement. On April 2, 2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed this case, finding that the two works were not substantially similar.

On February 17, 2013, Koepp received the WGA East&#x27;s Ian McClellan Hunter Award for Career Achievement.

On July 10, 2013, Lionsgate was reported to have acquired the comedic crime novel &quot;The Great Mortdecai Moustache Mystery&quot;, written by Kyril Bonfiglioli. Koepp directed the film, titled &quot;Mortdecai&quot;, from a script by Eric Aronson; Johnny Depp played the lead role of Charlie Mortdecai, and the film also featured Gwyneth Paltrow, Ewan McGregor, and Paul Bettany. Koepp adapted the Marcus Sakey novel &quot;Brilliance&quot;, which will star Will Smith and Noomi Rapace.

On March 15, 2016, The Walt Disney Company announced a fifth installment of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; saga, with Koepp as its screenwriter and Spielberg directing again. By June 2018, Koepp ultimately backed out of the project due to his commitment to &quot;You Should Have Left&quot;, a horror drama film Koepp wrote and directed. Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann, &quot;You Should Have Left&quot; was released in 2020, and stars Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried. The film was eventually released on June 30, 2023 but directed by James Mangold and written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth.

On September 3, 2019, Koepp made his novel debut with the publication of &quot;Cold Storage&quot;, a science-fiction thriller. A film adaptation was announced in May 2022 from Studiocanal, with Koepp writing the screenplay and Jonny Campbell directing; the cast consists of Liam Neeson, Joe Keery, Georgina Campbell, and Sosie Bacon.

On December 10, 2020, Amasia Entertainment and Universal Pictures announced Koepp had been tapped to write the script for a reboot of the Green Hornet franchise titled &quot;The Green Hornet and Kato&quot;. On February 25, 2021, it was announced Koepp would write and co-produce the thriller &quot;Kimi&quot;, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Zoë Kravitz. The film was released on Max (then HBO Max) on February 10, 2022.

Koepp&#x27;s second novel &quot;Aurora&quot; was published on June 7, 2022 and a film adaptation of the book is in development for Netflix, with Koepp writing the script and Kathryn Bigelow directing.

In December 2023, it was announced that Koepp had written the screenplay for the psychological thriller film &quot;Presence&quot;, which was directed by Soderbergh and premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. On January 22, 2024, it was announced that Koepp would return to the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise by writing &quot;Jurassic World Rebirth&quot;, with Gareth Edwards directing and Spielberg serving as executive producer. On April 17, 2024, it was confirmed that Koepp and Spielberg would work again on an original film about UFOs, which will be released in theatres by Universal Pictures on May 15, 2026. 

==Personal life==
Koepp is married to Melissa Thomas, a writer, with whom he has two children. He was previously married to artist Rosario Varela, with whom he has two children.

<text>Walter &quot;Wat&quot; Dumaux Edmonds (July 15, 1903 – January 24, 1998) was an American writer best known for historical novels. One of them, &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1936), was adapted as a Technicolor feature film in 1939, directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert.

==Life==

Edmonds was born in Boonville, New York. In 1919 he entered The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. Originally intending to study chemical engineering, he became more interested in writing and worked as managing editor of the Choate ‘’Literary Magazine‘’. He graduated in 1926 from Harvard, where he edited ‘’The Harvard Advocate‘’, and where he studied with Charles Townsend Copeland. He married Eleanor Stetson in 1930.

In 1929, he published his first novel, ‘’Rome Haul‘’, a work about the Erie Canal. The novel was adapted for the 1934 play ‘’The Farmer Takes a Wife‘’ and the 1935 film of the same name.

‘’Drums Along the Mohawk‘’ was on the bestseller list for two years, second only to Margaret Mitchell‘s famous 1936 novel ‘’Gone with the Wind‘’ for part of that time. Edmonds justifies his approach to historical accuracy in the preface:
Edmonds eventually published 34 books, many for children, as well as a number of magazine stories. He won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1960 and the Newbery Medal in 1942, for ‘’The Matchlock Gun‘’, and the National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature in 1976, for ‘’Bert Breen&#x27;s Barn‘’.

When Eleanor died in 1956, Walter married Katherine Howe Baker Carr, who died in 1989. Walter Edmonds died in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1998.

<text>Forge welding (FOW), also called fire welding, is a solid-state welding process that joins two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and then hammering them together. It may also consist of heating and forcing the metals together with presses or other means, creating enough pressure to cause plastic deformation at the weld surfaces. The process, although challenging, has been a method of joining metals used since ancient times and is a staple of traditional blacksmithing. Forge welding is versatile, being able to join a host of similar and dissimilar metals. With the invention of electrical welding and gas welding methods during the Industrial Revolution, manual forge-welding has been largely replaced, although automated forge-welding is a common manufacturing process.

==Introduction==
Forge welding is a process of joining metals by heating them beyond a certain threshold and forcing them together with enough pressure to cause deformation of the weld surfaces, creating a metallic bond between the atoms of the metals. The pressure required varies, depending on the temperature, strength, and hardness of the alloy. Forge welding is the oldest welding technique, and has been used since ancient times. 

Welding processes can generally be grouped into two categories: fusion and diffusion welding. Fusion welding involves localized melting of the metals at the weld interfaces, and is common in electric or gas welding techniques. This requires temperatures much higher than the melting point of the metal in order to cause localized melting before the heat can thermally conduct away from the weld, and often a filler metal is used to keep the weld from segregating due to the high surface tension. Diffusion welding consists of joining the metals without melting them, welding the surfaces together while in the solid state.

In diffusion welding, the heat source is often lower than the melting point of the metal, allowing more even heat-distribution thus reducing thermal stresses at the weld. In this method a filler metal is typically not used, but the weld occurs directly between the metals at the weld interface. This includes methods such as cold welding, explosion welding, and forge welding. Unlike other diffusion methods, in forge welding the metals are heated to a high temperature before forcing them together, usually resulting in greater plasticity at the weld surfaces. This generally makes forge welding more versatile than cold-diffusion techniques, which are usually performed on soft metals like copper or aluminum.

In forge welding, the entire welding areas are heated evenly. Forge welding can be used for a much wider range of harder metals and alloys, like steel and titanium.

==History==

The history of joining metals goes back to the Bronze Age, where bronzes of different hardness were often joined by casting-in. This method consisted of placing a solid part into a molten metal contained in a mold and allowing it to solidify without actually melting both metals, such as the blade of a sword into a handle or the tang of an arrowhead into the tip. Brazing and soldering were also common during the Bronze Age. 

The act of welding (joining two solid parts through diffusion) began with iron. The first welding process was forge welding, which started when humans learned to smelt iron from iron ore; most likely in Anatolia (Turkey) around 1800 BC. Ancient people could not create temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, so the bloomery process that was used for smelting iron produced a lump (bloom) of iron grains sintered together with small amounts of slag and other impurities, referred to as sponge iron because of its porosity. 

After smelting, the sponge iron needed to be heated above the welding temperature and hammered, or &quot;wrought.&quot; This squeezed out air pockets and melted slag, bringing the iron grains into close contact to form a solid block (billet). 

Many items made of wrought iron have been found by archeologists, that show evidence of forge welding, which date from before 1000 BC. Because iron was typically made in small amounts, any large object, such as the Delhi Pillar, needed to be forge welded out of smaller billets.

Forge welding grew from a trial-and-error method, becoming more refined over the centuries. Due to the poor quality of ancient metals, it was commonly employed in making composite steels, by joining high-carbon steels, that would resist deformation but break easily, with low-carbon steels, which resist fracture but bend too easily, creating an object with greater toughness and strength than could be produced with a single alloy. This method of pattern welding first appeared around 700 BC, and was primarily used for making weapons such as swords; the most widely known examples being Damascene, Japanese and Merovingian. This process was also common in the manufacture of tools, from wrought-iron plows with steel edges to iron chisels with steel cutting surfaces.

==Materials==
Many metals can be forge welded, with the most common being both high and low-carbon steels. Iron and even some hypoeutectic cast-irons can be forge welded. Some aluminum alloys can also be forge welded. Metals such as copper, bronze and brass do not forge weld readily. Although it is possible to forge weld copper-based alloys, it is often with great difficulty due to copper&#x27;s tendency to absorb oxygen during the heating. Copper and its alloys are usually better joined with cold welding, explosion welding, or other pressure-welding techniques. With iron or steel, the presence of even small amounts of copper severely reduces the alloy&#x27;s ability to forge weld.

Titanium alloys are commonly forge welded. Because of titanium&#x27;s tendency to absorb oxygen when molten, the solid-state, diffusion bond of a forge weld is often stronger than a fusion weld in which the metal is liquefied. 

Forge welding between similar materials is caused by solid-state diffusion. This results in a weld that consists of only the welded materials without any fillers or bridging materials. Forge welding between dissimilar materials is caused by the formation of a lower melting temperature eutectic between the materials. Due to this the weld is often stronger than the individual metals.

==Processes==
The most well-known and oldest forge-welding process is the manual-hammering method. Manual hammering is done by heating the metal to the proper temperature, coating with flux, overlapping the weld surfaces, and then striking the joint repeatedly with a hand-held hammer. The joint is often formed to allow space for the flux to flow out, by beveling or rounding the surfaces slightly, and hammered in a successively outward fashion to squeeze the flux out. The hammer blows are typically not as hard as those used for shaping, preventing the flux from being blasted out of the joint at the first blow.

When mechanical hammers were developed, forge welding could be accomplished by heating the metal, and then placing it between the mechanized hammer and the anvil. Originally powered by waterwheels, modern mechanical-hammers can also be operated by compressed air, electricity, steam, gas engines, and many other ways. Another method is forge welding with a die, whereby the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the finished shape. Roll welding is another forge welding process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld. 

Modern forge-welding is often automated, using computers, machines, and sophisticated hydraulic presses to produce a variety of products from a number of various alloys. For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. Flat stock is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam. 

Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together. 

Other methods include flash welding and percussion welding. These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the weld. Shielded active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.

==Temperature==
Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can be welded to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can be welded when nearly white hot; between and . Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can be welded when orangish-yellow, between and . Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, is typically welded at a bright yellow heat.

A primary requirement for forge welding is that both weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or twisted loose.

Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal to the point that it gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.

==Decarburization==
When steel is heated to an austenizing temperature, the carbon begins to diffuse through the iron. The higher the temperature; the greater the rate of diffusion. At such high temperatures, carbon readily combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, so the carbon can easily diffuse out of the steel and into the surrounding air. By the end of a blacksmithing job, the steel will be of a lower carbon content than it was prior to heating. Therefore, most blacksmithing operations are done as quickly as possible to reduce decarburization, preventing the steel from becoming too soft. 

To produce the right amount of hardness in the finished product, the smith generally begins with steel that has a carbon content that is higher than desired. In ancient times, forging often began with steel that had a carbon content much too high for normal use. Most ancient forge-welding began with hypereutectoid steel, containing a carbon content sometimes well above 1.0%. Hypereutectoid steels are typically too brittle to be useful in a finished product, but by the end of forging the steel typically had a high carbon-content ranging from 0.8% (eutectoid tool-steel) to 0.5% (hypoeutectoid spring-steel).

==Applications==
Forge welding has been used throughout its history for making most any items out of steel and iron. It has been used in everything from the manufacture of tools, farming implements, and cookware to the manufacture of fences, gates, and prison cells. In the early Industrial Revolution, it was commonly used in the manufacture of boilers and pressure vessels, until the introduction of fusion-welding. It was commonly used through the Middle Ages for producing armor and weapons.
One of the most famous applications of forge welding involves the production of pattern-welded blades. During this process a smith repeatedly draws out a billet of steel, folds it back and welds it upon itself. Another application was the manufacture of shotgun barrels. Metal wire was spooled onto a mandrel, and then forged into a barrel that was thin, uniform, and strong. In some cases the forge-welded objects are acid-etched to expose the underlying pattern of metal, which is unique to each item and provides aesthetic appeal.

Despite its diversity, forge welding had many limitations. A primary limitation was the size of objects that could be forge welded. Larger objects required a bigger heat source, and size reduced the ability to manually weld it together before it cooled too much. Welding large items like steel plate or girders was typically not possible, or at least highly impractical, until the invention of fusion welding, requiring them to be riveted instead. In some cases, fusion welding produced a much stronger weld, such as in the construction of boilers.

==Flux==
Forge welding requires the weld surfaces to be extremely clean or the metal will not join properly, if at all. Oxides tend to form on the surface while impurities like phosphorus and sulfur tend to migrate to the surface. Often a flux is used to keep the welding surfaces from oxidizing, which would produce a poor quality weld, and to extract other impurities from the metal. The flux mixes with the oxides that form and lowers the melting temperature and the viscosity of the oxides. This enables the oxides to flow out of the joint when the two pieces are beaten together. A simple flux can be made from borax, sometimes with the addition of powdered iron-filings.

The oldest flux used for forge welding was fine silica sand. The iron or steel would be heated in a reducing environment within the coals of the forge. Devoid of oxygen, the metal forms a layer of iron-oxide called wüstite on its surface. When the metal is hot enough, but below the welding temperature, the smith sprinkles some sand onto the metal. The silicon in the sand reacts with the wustite to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced a very effective flux which helped to make a strong weld.

Early examples of flux used different combinations and various amounts of iron fillings, borax, sal ammoniac, balsam of copaiba, cyanide of potash, and soda phosphate. The 1920 edition of &quot;Scientific American book of facts and formulae&quot; indicates a frequently offered trade secret as using copperas, saltpeter, common salt, black oxide of manganese, prussiate of potash, and &quot;nice welding sand&quot; (silicate).

<text>Monmouth Park Racetrack is an American race track for thoroughbred horse racing in Oceanport, New Jersey, United States. It is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and is operated under a five-year lease as a partnership with Darby Development, LLC.

Monmouth Park&#x27;s marquee event is the Haskell Invitational, named after Amory L. Haskell. The Haskell was first run in 1968 as a handicap, but was made into an Invitational Handicap in 1981. It is now a test for three-year-olds run in late July. Monmouth Park also now showcases the Jersey Derby originally run at Garden State Park until its closure in 2001. The racetrack&#x27;s season spans from early May to Labor Day in early September.

==History==
===Long Branch Racetrack===

Three different buildings have been called Monmouth Park throughout the years. The original thoroughbred racing track was opened by the Monmouth Park Association on July 30, 1870 in Eatontown, New Jersey to increase summer tourism for communities along the Jersey Shore. Monmouth Park early on earned the nickname as the &quot;Newmarket of America&quot; due to the excellence of its racing. However, after three years of being open financial issues caused the track to close.

In 1878, the track was bought by David D. Withers, George L. Lorillard, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and George P. Wetmore. The men spent four years renovating the grounds and grandstand and reopened Monmouth Park in 1882. From 1882 to 1890, the track increased in popularity and as a result, a new racetrack was constructed next to the original. The new racetrack opened in 1890 becoming the second Monmouth Park. However, legislation proposed in 1891 and enacted in 1894 barred parimutuel betting in New Jersey, and the track closed its doors. In May 1894, the Township Committee at Eatontown, New Jersey ordered the seizure and sale of the Monmouth Park Association&#x27;s grandstand and other property for the payment of back taxes and on May 7 was sold at a public auction.

Some of the major races held at the Long Branch track included the Champion Stakes, Junior Champion Stakes, Freehold Stakes and the Monmouth Cup. The United States Department of the Army later constructed Fort Monmouth on the site of the former racetrack.

===Monmouth Park Jockey Club===
In 1939, the State of New Jersey re-legalized parimutuel horse race betting. In 1946, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill providing for state regulation of horse racing. The bill was championed by Amory L. Haskell, who led the legislative charge to once again permit wagering on horse racing in New Jersey and Philip H. Iselin, a New York City textile magnate. They also had the backing of Reeve Schley, Joseph M. Roebling, John M. MacDonald, Townsend B. Martin, and James Cox Brady, Jr. The current Monmouth Park, now called the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, opened on June 19, 1946. Thoroughbred racing was back at the facility after a 53-year hiatus with 18,724 in attendance.

===Monmouth Park Racetrack===
The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority purchased Monmouth Park from its previous owners, the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, in 1985, in a deal valued at $45 million. The NJSEA still retains the corporate name &quot;Monmouth Park Jockey Club&quot;.

The Vans Warped Tour, a touring music and extreme sports festival, was successfully held at the racetrack in 2010 and 2011. It marks the New York stop on the nationwide tour, which visits the area during July. In 2012, the festival moved to the PNC Bank Arts Center in nearby Holmdel, New Jersey due to financial considerations.

In 2011, a five-year lease was signed with Morris Bailey, co-owner of Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, to provide a marketing partnership between the casino and racetrack. The agreement allowed Resorts to sponsor the Haskell Invitational, and possibilities include a merging of loyalty programs as well as bringing entertainers&#x27; appearances at the casino to the racetrack. The program is part of a strategy to mesh horse racing with casino gambling.

In April 2013, Monmouth Park opened the Bluegrass Miniature Golf Course near the Port-au-Peck Avenue entrance. The Course features two 18-hole courses, the Haskell Course and the Triple Crown Course featuring each hole named after a different race horse.

In July 2016, the luxury restaurant Blu Grotto, named after the Blue Grotto sea cave on the Italian island of Capri, opened at Monmouth Park. The restaurant is open year-round and is located near the racetrack&#x27;s quarter-pole. The Beer Garden at Blu Grotto opened in 2017.

On June 14, 2018, the Monmouth Park Sports Book by William Hill sportsbook opened and Monmouth Park became the first location in New Jersey to offer sports betting. Monmouth Park had pushed to legalize sports betting, which was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot;.

On May 16, 2024, Monmouth Park held a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new trackside sportsbook operated by Caesars Entertainment. William Hill was acquired by Caesars in 2022 and re-branded the current sportsbook. The new sportsbook will be located at the track&#x27;s first quarter-pole and host a Shake Shack, self-service betting kiosks and indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the racetrack and the infield. The new facility is scheduled to open in 2025.

==Physical attributes==
The main track is a one-mile (1.6 km) dirt oval with chutes for 6 furlong and races.
The turf course is seven furlongs in circumference, with a diagonal chute for races between and . A re-design of the grass course for the 2006 season brought with it a new, second chute to accommodate sprint or rarely races. Turf races can be run along the hedge, or with the portable rail out (dubbed the &quot;Haskell Course&quot;), (&quot;Monmouth Course&quot;) or (&quot;Lennox Course&quot;).

The Stable Area, located directly to the north of the backstretch of the main track, contains a total of forty barns and stables, twelve north of the New Jersey Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line (connected by its own service and access road) and twenty eight on the main complex.

The Wolf Hill Farm, which served Monmouth Park as a private stable and practice facility, was located adjacent to and immediately west of the main complex. Wolf Hill, owned and operated by the Valentino Family from the nearby City of Long Branch, New Jersey featured barns, stables and a practice track featuring a dirt oval and turf course identical to that at Monmouth Park&#x27;s main facility only built to 50% scale. The Valentino Family sold Wolf Hill Farm to the Monmouth Park Jockey Club in 1963 which then became part of the greater Monmouth Park Complex. It was transferred to state ownership in the 1986 takeover by the NJSEA and was eventually sold to the Monmouth County Park System in 1998 which now operates the site as Wolf Hill Recreation Area that features a 4-acre dog park, an 18-hole disc golf course, a baseball field and two softball fields. While Wolf Hill ceased operating as a farm following the 1963 sale, owners and trainers continued to use Wolf Hill&#x27;s practice track well into the 1990s. Remnants of the practice were clearly visible on the site until after the 2009 meet. After the 2009 meet, construction began in the Wolf Hill area, eliminating the last of the practice track.

===Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships===
On October 26 and 27, 2007, Monmouth Park hosted the Breeders&#x27; Cup for the first time in its history.&lt;br&gt;
The 2007 Event also marked the first time the event has been held over two days and also the creation of three new races held on Day 1 of the Championships.

Winners of Races:&lt;br&gt;
Day 1&lt;br&gt;
Filly &amp; Mare Sprint-Maryfield&lt;br&gt;
Juvenile Turf-Nownownow&lt;br&gt;
Dirt Mile-Corinthian&lt;br&gt;
Day 2&lt;br&gt;
Juvenile Fillies-Indian Blessing&lt;br&gt;

The Classic was marred by a fatal injury suffered by George Washington, the 2006 European 3-year-old champion who had returned to training when his stud career was scuttled by fertility problems. He suffered a dislocated fracture of his right front ankle and was euthanized on the track.

===Million Dollar Meet===
In March 2010, it was announced that Monmouth Park would shorten its summer meet, conducting only 50 days of live racing (down from 141 total thoroughbred days in the state) for a total of $50 million in purse money for the 2010 meet. This was done due to the recent monetary losses of the racetrack industry in New Jersey and made it the most expensive purse structure in North America at the time.

==Accessibility &amp; transportation==
The Park is served by the Monmouth Park station on New Jersey Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line during the racing season.

A special train called the &quot;Pony Express&quot; was discontinued after the 2005 racing season. This train operated between Hoboken Terminal and the racetrack, terminating on a rail siding near the grandstand entrance. It was often scouted out by railfans due to the variety of equipment that were used on the train in recent years, ranging from the 1970 vintage Pullman Standard Erie Lackawanna Comet I cars to modern Alstom Metro-North Comet Vs.

Monmouth Park is also served by the 831 New Jersey Transit Bus route.

The Park is accessible by car via NJ-36 with connections to the Garden State Parkway, I-195, New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and other highways and roads. Parking is available in several on site lots.

<text>Plop!, &quot;The New Magazine of Weird Humor!&quot;, was a comic book anthology series published by DC Comics in the mid-1970s. It falls into the horror / humor genre. It lasted 24 issues and the series ran from Sept./Oct. 1973 to Nov./Dec. 1976.

==Background and creation==
According to Steve Skeates, &quot;Plop!&quot; was based around a horror / humor story he wrote called &quot;The Poster Plague&quot;, which was published in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;.

The title initially was intended to be called &quot;Zany&quot;. A number of the one-panel cartoons published in the comic included the visible prefix ZA, in reference to the originally intended title. Sergio Aragonés credits publisher Carmine Infantino with coming up with the final title: &quot;Joe Orlando and I were sitting in a restaurant talking with Carmine Infantino. They wanted a magazine that was different, something about black humor. Carmine came up with the name. We were talking about it and he said, &#x27;What will we call it?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;We can call it anything, because if the magazine is good, then it will stay&#x27;. And he said, &#x27;No, we can&#x27;t call it, for instance...PLOP!&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Yes, we can&#x27;. And so I started making sketches of things going PLOP! and they laughed and decided the name was good&quot;.

==Contents==
Each issue was centered on a frame story starring three ghoulish characters with Biblical names: Cain, Abel (previously introduced in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; and &quot;The House of Secrets&quot;, respectively) and Eve. An issue would typically contain a story told by each of the characters, each bidding to outdo the others in fiendishness.

Stories for &quot;Plop!&quot; were generally created in one of three ways. The most common was that Steve Skeates would write the stories himself, using the full script method. Due to a brief feud with editor Joe Orlando, for a time Skeates&#x27; stories were written under the pseudonym Chester P. Hazel. The second way was using plot ideas submitted by readers of the anthology. Orlando would select which plot ideas would be used and Skeates would then write the full story. The third way was that Aragonés would write the plot, and someone else would write the script once the story was fully drawn.

An illustrative tale drawn by Berni Wrightson involved a gourmet diner whose love for frog legs leads to a predictable amphibian revenge: he is left without lower limbs and is doomed to negotiate the world on a trolley.

Basil Wolverton and Wallace Wood provided covers for the first 19 issues, each depicting a freakish character of some kind. The cover borders hosting a plethora of creatures, however, were drawn by Sergio Aragonés. All three artists worked on &quot;MAD&quot;, and the logo of &quot;Plop!&quot; is reminiscent of the early logo of that magazine. Wolverton&#x27;s covers were not drawn for &quot;Plop!&quot;; they were inventory pieces which he sent to DC Comics as a general submission. When all of the drawings he submitted were found suitable for use in &quot;Plop!&quot;, Wolverton briefly came out of retirement so that he could continue drawing covers for the magazine. After he had a stroke, the magazine turned to Wood as the new cover artist.

Aragonés drew most of the frame stories. Later MAD contributor Dave Manak also did art.

The magazine was first published without ads but, when sales proved insufficient, advertisements were brought in for later issues. The magazine sold so poorly that, even with the added advertising revenue, DC Comics lost money on each issue, leading to its cancellation.

==Awards==
The series received a number of awards, including the Shazam Award for Best Humor Story in 1973 for &quot;The Gourmet&quot; in issue #1, and another nomination for the same award for &quot;The Escape&quot; in the same issue. Steve Skeates also won the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Humor Division) in 1973 for his work on the series. The comic was nominated for the Eagle Award for Favourite Comic (Humour) in 1977.

== Collected editions ==

<text>Vladimir Aleksandrovich Albitzky () (16 June 1891 – 15 June 1952) was a Soviet/Russian astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. In modern English transliteration, his surname would be given as Al&#x27;bitskii or Al&#x27;bitsky. In the literature, he is sometimes referred to as W. A. Albizkij, however his surname usually appears in the literature as &quot;Albitzky&quot;. His asteroid discoveries are credited as &quot;V. Albitskij&quot;.

He came to the Simeiz Observatory (Симеиз) in Crimea in 1922, working with G. A. Shajn and G. N. Neujmin, and became head of the observatory in 1934. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of 10 asteroids during 1923–1925.

The Eunomia asteroid 1783 Albitskij, discovered by astronomer Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz Observatory in 1935, was named in his honor.

<text>Letter case is the distinction between the letters that are in larger uppercase or capitals (more formally &quot;majuscule&quot;) and smaller lowercase (more formally &quot;minuscule&quot;) in the written representation of certain languages. The writing systems that distinguish between the upper- and lowercase have two parallel sets of letters: each in the majuscule set has a counterpart in the minuscule set. Some counterpart letters have the same shape, and differ only in size (e.g. or ), but for others the shapes are different (e.g., or ). The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and pronunciation and are typically treated identically when sorting in alphabetical order.

Letter case is generally applied in a mixed-case fashion, with both upper and lowercase letters appearing in a given piece of text for legibility. The choice of case is often denoted by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In orthography, the uppercase is reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun (called capitalisation, or capitalised words), which makes lowercase more common in regular text.

In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in uppercase letters, which are easier to distinguish individually than the lowercase when space restrictions require very small lettering. In mathematics, on the other hand, uppercase and lower case letters denote generally different mathematical objects, which may be related when the two cases of the same letter are used; for example, may denote an element of a set .

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;upper case&quot; and &quot;lower case&quot; may be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (&quot;upper-case&quot; and &quot;lower-case&quot;particularly if they pre-modify another noun), or as a single word (&quot;uppercase&quot; and &quot;lowercase&quot;). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow drawers called &quot;type cases&quot; used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate shallow tray or &quot;case&quot; that was located above the case that held the small letters.
===Majuscule===
Majuscule (, less commonly ), for palaeographers, is technically any script whose letters have very few or very short ascenders and descenders, or none at all (for example, the majuscule scripts used in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, or the Book of Kells). By virtue of their visual impact, this made the term majuscule an apt descriptor for what much later came to be more commonly referred to as uppercase letters.

===Minuscule===

Minuscule refers to lower-case letters. The word is often spelled &quot;miniscule&quot;, by association with the unrelated word &quot;miniature&quot; and the prefix &quot;mini-&quot;. That has traditionally been regarded as a spelling mistake (since &quot;minuscule&quot; is derived from the word &quot;minus&quot;), but is now so common that some dictionaries tend to accept it as a non-standard or variant spelling. &quot;Miniscule&quot; is still less likely, however, to be used in reference to lower-case letters.

==Typographical considerations==
The glyphs of lowercase letters can resemble smaller forms of the uppercase glyphs restricted to the baseband (e.g. &quot;C/c&quot; and &quot;S/s&quot;, cf. small caps) or can look hardly related (e.g. &quot;D/d&quot; and &quot;G/g&quot;). Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case variants of each letter included in the English alphabet (the exact representation will vary according to the typeface and font used):

(Some lowercase letters have variations e.g. a/ɑ.)

Typographically, the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally are of uniform height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with &quot;Q&quot; and sometimes &quot;J&quot; having a descending element; also, various diacritics can add to the normal height of a letter).

There is more variation in the height of the minuscules, as some of them have parts higher (ascenders) or lower (descenders) than the typical size. Normally, &quot;b, d, f, h, k, l, t&quot; are the letters with ascenders, and &quot;g, j, p, q, y&quot; are the ones with descenders. In addition, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts, &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; make up the ascender set, and &quot;3, 4, 5, 7&quot;, and &quot;9&quot; the descender set.

==Bicameral script==


A minority of writing systems use two separate cases. Such writing systems are called &quot;bicameral scripts&quot;. These scripts include the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Coptic, Armenian, Glagolitic, Adlam, Warang Citi, Old Hungarian, Garay, Zaghawa, Osage, Vithkuqi, and Deseret scripts. Languages written in these scripts use letter cases as an aid to clarity. The Georgian alphabet has several variants, and there were attempts to use them as different cases, but the modern written Georgian language does not distinguish case.

All other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules a system called unicameral script or unicase. This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts.

In scripts with a case distinction, lowercase is generally used for the majority of text; capitals are used for capitalisation and emphasis when boldface is not available. Acronyms (and particularly initialisms) are often written in all-caps, depending on various factors.

===Capitalisation===

Capitalisation is the writing of a word with its first letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase. Capitalisation rules vary by language and are often quite complex, but in most modern languages that have capitalisation, the first word of every sentence is capitalised, as are all proper nouns. 

Capitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardised for formal writing. Capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person pronoun &quot;I&quot; and the vocative particle &quot;&quot;. There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. Honorifics and personal titles showing rank or prestige are capitalised when used together with the name of the person (for example, &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;, &quot;Bishop Gorman&quot;, &quot;Professor Moore&quot;) or as a direct address, but normally not when used alone and in a more general sense. It can also be seen as customary to capitalise any word in some contexts even a pronoun referring to the deity of a monotheistic religion.

Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and publication titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature. In political writing, parody and satire, the unexpected emphasis afforded by otherwise ill-advised capitalisation is often used to great stylistic effect, such as in the case of George Orwell&#x27;s Big Brother.

Other languages vary in their use of capitals. For example, in German all nouns are capitalised (this was previously common in English as well, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries), while in Romance and most other European languages the names of the days of the week, the names of the months, and adjectives of nationality, religion, and so on normally begin with a lower-case letter. On the other hand, in some languages it is customary to capitalise formal polite pronouns, for example , (Danish), , (German), and or (short for in Spanish).

Informal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother to follow the conventions concerning capitalisation, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.

===Exceptional letters and digraphs===
* The German letter &quot;ß&quot; formerly existed only in lower case. The orthographical capitalisation does not concern &quot;ß&quot;, which generally does not occur at the beginning of a word, and in the all-caps style it has traditionally been replaced by the digraph &quot;SS&quot;. Since June 2017, however, capital ẞ is accepted as an alternative in the all-caps style. 
* The Greek upper-case letter &quot;Σ&quot; has two different lower-case forms: &quot;ς&quot; in word-final position and &quot;σ&quot; elsewhere. In a similar manner, the Latin upper-case letter &quot;S&quot; used to have two different lower-case forms: &quot;s&quot; in word-final position and &quot; ſ &quot; elsewhere. The latter form, called the long s, fell out of general use before the middle of the 19th century, except for the countries that continued to use blackletter typefaces such as Fraktur. When blackletter type fell out of general use in the mid-20th century, even those countries dropped the long s.
* The treatment of the Greek iota subscript with upper-case letters is complicated.
* Unlike most languages that use Latin-script and link the dotless upper-case &quot;I&quot; with the dotted lower-case &quot;i&quot;, Turkish, Tatar (including Crimean Tatar) as well as some forms of Azeri have both a dotted and dotless I, each in both upper and lower case. Each of the two pairs (&quot;İ/i&quot; and &quot;I/ı&quot;) represents a distinctive phoneme.
* In some languages, specific digraphs may be regarded as single letters, and in Dutch, the digraph &quot;IJ/ij&quot; is even capitalised with both components written in uppercase (for example, &quot;IJsland&quot; rather than &quot;Ijsland&quot;). In other languages, such as Welsh and Hungarian, various digraphs are regarded as single letters for collation purposes, but the second component of the digraph will still be written in lower case even if the first component is capitalised. Similarly, in South Slavic languages whose orthography is coordinated between the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, the Latin digraphs &quot;ǈ/ǉ&quot;, &quot;ǋ/ǌ&quot; and &quot;ǅ/ǆ&quot; are each regarded as a single letter (like their Cyrillic equivalents &quot;Љ/љ&quot;, &quot;Њ/њ&quot; and &quot;Џ/џ&quot;, respectively), but only in all-caps style should both components be in upper case (e.g. ǈiǉan–ǇIǇAN, ǋoǌa–ǊOǊA, ǅiǆa–ǄIǄA). Unicode designates a single character for each case variant (i.e., upper case, title case and lower case) of the three digraphs.
* Some English surnames such as fforbes are traditionally spelt with a digraph instead of a capital letter (at least for ff).
* In the Hawaiian orthography, the okina is a phonemic symbol that visually resembles a left single quotation mark. Representing the glottal stop, the okina can be characterised as either a letter or a diacritic. As a unicase letter, the okina is unaffected by capitalisation; it is the following letter that is capitalised instead. According to the Unicode standard, the okina is formally encoded as , but it is not uncommon to substitute this with a similar punctuation character, such as the left single quotation mark or an apostrophe.

===Related features===
Similar orthographic and graphostylistic conventions are used for emphasis or following language-specific or other rules, including:
* Font effects such as italic type or oblique type, boldface, and choice of serif vs. sans-serif.
* In mathematical notation lower-case and upper-case letters have generally different meanings, and other meanings can be implied by the use of other typefaces, such as boldface, fraktur, script typeface, and blackboard bold.
* Some letters of the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets and some jamo of the Korean hangul have different forms depending on placement within a word, but these rules are strict and the different forms cannot be used for emphasis.
**In the Arabic and Arabic-based alphabets, letters in a word are connected, except for several that cannot connect to the following letter. Letters may have distinct forms depending on whether they are initial (connected only to the following letter), medial (connected to both neighboring letters), final (connected only to the preceding letter), or isolated (connected to neither a preceding nor a following letter).
**In the Hebrew alphabet, five letters have a distinct form (see Final form) that is used when they are word-final.
* In Georgian, some authors use isolated letters from the ancient Asomtavruli alphabet within a text otherwise written in the modern Mkhedruli in a fashion that is reminiscent of the usage of upper-case letters in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
* In the Japanese writing system, an author has the option of switching between kanji, hiragana, katakana, and rōmaji. In particular, every hiragana character has an equivalent katakana character, and vice versa. Romanised Japanese sometimes uses lowercase letters to represent words that would be written in hiragana, and uppercase letters to represent words that would be written in katakana. Some kana characters are written in smaller type when they modify or combine with the preceding sign (&quot;yōon&quot;) or the following sign (&quot;sokuon&quot;).

==Stylistic or specialised usage==
In English, a variety of case styles are used in various circumstances:

; Sentence case
: &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot; A mixed-case style in which the first word of the sentence is capitalised, as well as proper nouns and other words as required by a more specific rule. This is generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography.
: In computer programming, the initial capital is easier to automate than the other rules. For example, on English-language Wikipedia, the first character in is capitalised by default. Because the other rules are more complex, substrings for concatenation into sentences are commonly written in &quot;mid-sentence case&quot;, applying all the rules of sentence case except the initial capital.
; Title case (capital case, headline style)
: &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog&quot; A mixed-case style with all words capitalised, except for certain subsets (particularly articles and short prepositions and conjunctions) defined by rules that are not universally standardised. The standardisation is only at the level of house styles and individual style manuals. 
; Start case (First letter of each word capitalized)
: &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot; &quot;Start case,&quot; &quot;initial caps&quot; or &quot;proper case&quot; is a simplified variant of title case. In text processing, start case usually involves the capitalisation of all words irrespective of their part of speech.
; All caps (all uppercase)
: &quot;THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG&quot; A unicase style with capital letters only. This can be used in headings and special situations, such as for typographical emphasis in text made on a typewriter. With the advent of the Internet, the all-caps style is more often used for emphasis; however, it is considered poor netiquette by some to type in all capitals, and said to be tantamount to shouting. Long spans of Latin-alphabet text in all upper-case are more difficult to read because of the absence of the ascenders and descenders found in lower-case letters, which aids recognition and legibility. In some cultures it is common to write family names in all caps to distinguish them from the given names, especially in identity documents such as passports. Certain musicians—such as Marina and Finneas, who are both known mononymously, and some bands such as Haim and Kiss—have their names stylised in all caps. Additionally, it is common for bands with vowelless names (a process colourfully known as &quot;disemvoweling&quot;) to use all caps, with prominent examples including STRFKR, MSTRKRFT, PWR BTTM, SBTRKT, JPNSGRLS (now known as Hotel Mira), BLK JKS, MNDR, and DWNTWN.
; Small caps
: &quot;&quot;Similar in form to capital letters but roughly the size of a lower-case &quot;x&quot;, small caps can be used instead of lower-case letters and combined with regular caps in a mixed-case fashion. This is a feature of certain fonts, such as Copperplate Gothic. According to various typographical traditions, the height of small caps can be equal to or slightly larger than the x-height of the typeface (the smaller variant is sometimes called &quot;petite caps&quot; and may also be mixed with the larger variant). Small caps can be used for acronyms, names, mathematical entities, computer commands in printed text, business or personal printed stationery letterheads, and other situations where a given phrase needs to be distinguished from the main text.
; All lowercase
:&quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;
:A unicase style with no capital letters. This is sometimes used for artistic effect, such as in poetry. Also commonly seen in computer languages, and in informal electronic communications such as SMS language and instant messaging (avoiding the shift key, to type more quickly). Examples in music are relatively common. For example, several of Taylor Swift&#x27;s albums, including &quot;reputation&quot;, &quot;folklore&quot;, and &quot;evermore&quot;, were all stylised in lowercase. Bands such as Weezer and Silverchair were also stylised in lowercase for multiple albums during their respective careers, with the former consistently using lowercase in their logo since their first studio album. Billie Eilish&#x27;s debut studio album—&quot;When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&quot;—has all of its tracks stylised in lowercase. Some people, such as author bell hooks, write their names in all lowercase. Fully lowercase stylisation has been linked to the &quot;disavowal of hierarchy&quot;, and on the Internet, frequently serves as &quot;shorthand for authenticity and vulnerability&quot;.

=== Headings and publication titles ===
In English-language publications, various conventions are used for the capitalisation of words in publication titles and headlines, including chapter and section headings. The rules differ substantially between individual house styles.

The convention followed by many British publishers (including scientific publishers like &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;New Scientist&quot;, magazines like &quot;The Economist&quot;, and newspapers like &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;) and many U.S. newspapers is sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, i.e. capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called &quot;sentence case&quot;. It may also be applied to publication titles, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. An example of a global publisher whose English-language house style prescribes sentence-case titles and headings is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

For publication titles it is, however, a common typographic practice among both British and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words (and in the United States, this is often applied to headings, too). This family of typographic conventions is usually called &quot;title case&quot;. For example, R. M. Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Manual of Style&quot; (2002) suggests capitalising &quot;the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions&quot;. This is an old form of emphasis, similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles. The rules which prescribe which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct–incorrect distinction and are not universally standardised; they differ between style guides, although most style guides tend to follow a few strong conventions, as follows:
* Most styles capitalise all words except for short closed-class words (certain parts of speech, namely, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions); but the first word (always) and last word (in many styles) are also capitalised, regardless of their part of speech. Many styles capitalise longer prepositions such as &quot;between&quot; and &quot;throughout&quot;, but not shorter ones such as &quot;for&quot; and &quot;with&quot;. Typically, a preposition is considered short if it has up to three or four letters.
* A few styles capitalise all words in title case (the so-called &quot;start case&quot;), which has the advantage of being easy to implement and hard to get &quot;wrong&quot; (that is, &quot;not edited to style&quot;). Because of this rule&#x27;s simplicity, software case-folding routines can handle 95% or more of the editing, especially if they are programmed for desired exceptions (such as &quot;FBI&quot; rather than &quot;Fbi&quot;).
* As for whether hyphenated words are capitalised not only at the beginning but also after the hyphen, there is no universal standard; variation occurs in the wild and among house styles (e.g., &quot;The Letter-&quot;C&quot;ase Rule in My Book&quot;; &quot;Short-&quot;t&quot;erm Follow-&quot;u&quot;p Care for Burns&quot;). Traditional copyediting makes a distinction between &quot;temporary compounds&quot; (such as many nonce [novel instance] compound modifiers), in which every part of the hyphenated word is capitalised (e.g. &quot;How This Particular Author Chose to Style His &quot;A&quot;utumn-&quot;A&quot;pple-&quot;P&quot;icking Heading&quot;), and &quot;permanent compounds&quot;, which are terms that, although compound and hyphenated, are so well established that dictionaries enter them as headwords (e.g., &quot;Short-&quot;t&quot;erm Follow-&quot;u&quot;p Care for Burns&quot;).

Title case is widely used in many English-language publications, especially in the United States. However, its conventions are sometimes not followed strictlyespecially in informal writing.

In creative typography, such as music record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all-lowercase letters and special case styles, such as studly caps (see below). For example, in the wordmarks of video games it is not uncommon to use stylised upper-case letters at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., , , and ).

=== Multi-word proper nouns ===
Single-word proper nouns are capitalised in formal written English, unless the name is intentionally stylised to break this rule (such as e e cummings, bell hooks, eden ahbez, and danah boyd).

Multi-word proper nouns include names of organisations, publications, and people. Often the rules for &quot;title case&quot; (described in the previous section) are applied to these names, so that non-initial articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are lowercase, and all other words are uppercase. For example, the short preposition &quot;of&quot; and the article &quot;the&quot; are lowercase in &quot;Steering Committee of the Finance Department&quot;. Usually only capitalised words are used to form an acronym variant of the name, though there is some variation in this.

With personal names, this practice can vary (sometimes all words are capitalised, regardless of length or function), but is not limited to English names. Examples include the English names Tamar of Georgia and Catherine the Great, &quot;van&quot; and &quot;der&quot; in Dutch names, &quot;von&quot; and &quot;zu&quot; in German, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; in Spanish names, &quot;de&quot; or &quot;d&#x27;&quot; in French names, and &quot;ibn&quot; in Arabic names.

Some surname prefixes also affect the capitalisation of the following internal letter or word, for example &quot;Mac&quot; in Celtic names and &quot;Al&quot; in Arabic names.

===Unit symbols and prefixes in the metric system===
In the International System of Units (SI), a letter usually has different meanings in upper and lower case when used as a unit symbol. Generally, unit symbols are written in lower case, but if the name of the unit is derived from a proper noun, the first letter of the symbol is capitalised. Nevertheless, the &quot;name&quot; of the unit, if spelled out, is always considered a common noun and written accordingly in lower case. For example:

* 1 s (one second) when used for the base unit of time.
* 1 S (one siemens) when used for the unit of electric conductance and admittance (named after Werner von Siemens).
* 1 Sv (one sievert), used for the unit of ionising radiation dose (named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert).

For the purpose of clarity, the symbol for litre can optionally be written in upper case even though the name is not derived from a proper noun. For example, &quot;one litre&quot; may be written as:

* , the original form, for typefaces in which &quot;digit one&quot; , &quot;lower-case ell&quot; , and &quot;upper-case i&quot; look different.
* 1 L, an alternative form, for typefaces in which these characters are difficult to distinguish, or the typeface the reader will be using is unknown. A &quot;script l&quot; in various typefaces (e.g.: 1 l) has traditionally been used in some countries to prevent confusion; however, the separate Unicode character which represents this, , is deprecated by the SI. Another solution sometimes seen in Web typography is to use a serif font for &quot;lower-case ell&quot; in otherwise sans-serif material (1 l).

The letter case of a prefix symbol is determined independently of the unit symbol to which it is attached. Lower case is used for all submultiple prefix symbols and the small multiple prefix symbols up to &quot;k&quot; (for kilo, meaning 103 = 1000 multiplier), whereas upper case is used for larger multipliers:

* 1 ms, millisecond, a small measure of time (&quot;m&quot; for milli, meaning 10−3 = 1/1000 multiplier).
* 1 Ms, megasecond, a large measure of time (&quot;M&quot; for mega, meaning 106 = 1 000 000 multiplier).
* 1 mS, millisiemens, a small measure of electric conductance.
* 1 MS, megasiemens, a large measure of electric conductance.
* 1 mm, millimetre, a small measure of length.
* 1 Mm, megametre, a large measure of length.

===Use within programming languages===

Some case styles are not used in standard English, but are common in computer programming, product branding, or other specialised fields.

The usage derives from how programming languages are parsed, programmatically. They generally separate their syntactic tokens by simple whitespace, including space characters, tabs, and newlines. When the tokens, such as function and variable names start to multiply in complex software development, and there is still a need to keep the source code human-readable, Naming conventions make this possible. So for example, a function dealing with matrix multiplication might formally be called:

* , with the asterisk standing in for an equally inscrutable list of 13 parameters (in BLAS),
* , in some hypothetical higher level manifestly typed language, broadly following the syntax of C++ or Java,
* in something derived from LISP, or perhaps
* in the CLOS, or some newer derivative language supporting type inference and multiple dispatch.

In each case, the capitalisation or lack thereof supports a different function. In the first, FORTRAN compatibility requires case-insensitive naming and short function names. The second supports easily discernible function and argument names and types, within the context of an imperative, strongly typed language. The third supports the macro facilities of LISP, and its tendency to view programs and data minimalistically, and as interchangeable. The fourth idiom needs much less syntactic sugar overall, because much of the semantics are implied, but because of its brevity and so lack of the need for capitalization or multipart words at all, might also make the code too abstract and overloaded for the common programmer to understand.

Understandably then, such coding conventions are highly subjective, and can lead to rather opinionated debate, such as in the case of editor wars, or those about indent style. Capitalisation is no exception.

====Camel case====
Spaces and punctuation are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. If this includes the first letter of the first word (CamelCase, &quot;PowerPoint&quot;, &quot;TheQuick...&quot;, etc.), the case is sometimes called upper camel case (or, illustratively, CamelCase), Pascal case in reference to the Pascal programming language or bumpy case.

When the first letter of the first word is lowercase (&quot;iPod&quot;, &quot;eBay&quot;, &quot;theQuickBrownFox...&quot;), the case is usually known as lower camel case or dromedary case (illustratively: dromedaryCase). This format has become popular in the branding of information technology products and services, with an initial &quot;i&quot; meaning &quot;Internet&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot;, as in iPod, or an initial &quot;e&quot; meaning &quot;electronic&quot;, as in email (electronic mail) or e-commerce (electronic commerce).

====Snake case====

Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single underscores. Normally the letters share the same case (e.g. &quot;UPPER_CASE_EMBEDDED_UNDERSCORE&quot; or &quot;lower_case_embedded_underscore&quot;) but the case can be mixed, as in OCaml variant constructors (e.g. &quot;Upper_then_lowercase&quot;). The style may also be called &quot;pothole case&quot;, especially in Python programming, in which this convention is often used for naming variables. Illustratively, it may be rendered &quot;snake_case&quot;, &quot;pothole_case&quot;, etc.. When all-upper-case, it may be referred to as &quot;screaming snake case&quot; (or &quot;SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE&quot;) or &quot;hazard case&quot;.

====Kebab case====

Similar to snake case, above, except hyphens rather than underscores are used to replace spaces. It is also known as spinal case, param case, Lisp case in reference to the Lisp programming language, or dash case (or illustratively as kebab-case, looking similar to the skewer that sticks through a kebab). If every word is capitalised, the style is known as train case (&quot;TRAIN-CASE&quot;).

In CSS, all property names and most keyword values are primarily formatted in kebab case.

=== Studly caps ===

Studly caps are an arbitrary mixing of the cases with no semantic or syntactic significance to the use of the capitals. Sometimes only vowels are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random. The name comes from the sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness (). It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do soe.g., Sun Microsystems&#x27; naming of a windowing system NeWS. Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: &quot;stUdlY cAps&quot;, &quot;StUdLy CaPs&quot;, etc..

==Case folding and case conversion==
In the character sets developed for computing, each upper- and lower-case letter is encoded as a separate character. In order to enable case folding and case conversion, the software needs to link together the two characters representing the case variants of a letter. (Some old character-encoding systems, such as the Baudot code, are restricted to one set of letters, usually represented by the upper-case variants.)

Case-insensitive operations can be said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The conversion of letter case in a string is common practice in computer applications, for instance to make case-insensitive comparisons. Many high-level programming languages provide simple methods for case conversion, at least for the ASCII character set.

Whether or not the case variants are treated as equivalent to each other varies depending on the computer system and context. For example, user passwords are generally case sensitive in order to allow more diversity and make them more difficult to break. In contrast, case is often ignored in keyword searches in order to ignore insignificant variations in keyword capitalisation both in queries and queried material.

===Unicode case folding and script identification===
Unicode defines case folding through the three case-mapping properties of each character: upper case, lower case, and title case (in this context, &quot;title case&quot; relates to ligatures and digraphs encoded as mixed-case single characters, in which the first component is in upper case and the second component in lower case). These properties relate all characters in scripts with differing cases to the other case variants of the character.

As briefly discussed in Unicode Technical Note #26, &quot;In terms of implementation issues, any attempt at a unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [and] make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making all casing operations context sensitive […]&quot;. In other words, while the shapes of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a &quot;single&quot; code point for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin b (U+0062), Greek β (U+03B2) or Cyrillic в (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being identical. Without letter case, a &quot;unified European alphabet&quot;such as ABБCГDΔΕЄЗFΦGHIИJ...Z, with an appropriate subset for each languageis feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols.

===Methods in word processing===
Most modern word processors provide automated case conversion with a simple click or keystroke. For example, in Microsoft Office Word, there is a dialog box for toggling the selected text through UPPERCASE, then lowercase, then Title Case (actually start caps; exception words must be lowercased individually). The keystroke does the same.

===Methods in programming===
In some forms of BASIC there are two methods for case conversion:
UpperA$ = UCASE$(&quot;a&quot;)
LowerA$ = LCASE$(&quot;A&quot;)
C and C++, as well as any C-like language that conforms to its standard library, provide these functions in the file ctype.h:
char upperA = toupper(&#x27;a&#x27;);
char lowerA = tolower(&#x27;A&#x27;);
Case conversion is different with different character sets. In ASCII or EBCDIC, case can be converted in the following way, in C:

int toupper(int c) { return islower(c) ? c – &#x27;a&#x27; + &#x27;A&#x27; : c; }
int tolower(int c) { return isupper(c) ? c – &#x27;A&#x27; + &#x27;a&#x27; : c; }

This only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works.

Some computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised. Visual Basic calls this &quot;proper case&quot;; Python calls it &quot;title case&quot;. This differs from usual title casing conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised.

==History==

Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a pen, these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the half-uncials and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines. These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script, developed by Alcuin for use in the court of Charlemagne, which quickly spread across Europe. The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved, faster readability.

In Latin, papyri from Herculaneum dating before 79 CE (when it was destroyed) have been found that have been written in old Roman cursive, where the early forms of minuscule letters &quot;d&quot;, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, for example, can already be recognised. According to papyrologist Knut Kleve, &quot;The theory, then, that the lower-case letters have been developed from the fifth century uncials and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong.&quot; Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral: a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed. European languages, except for Ancient Greek and Latin, did not make the case distinction before about 1300.

The timeline of writing in Western Europe can be divided into four eras:
*Greek majuscule (9th–3rd century BCE) in contrast to the Greek uncial script (3rd century BCE – 12th century CE) and the later Greek minuscule
*Roman majuscule (7th century BCE – 4th century CE) in contrast to the Roman uncial (4th–8th century CE), Roman half uncial, and minuscule
*Carolingian majuscule (4th–8th century CE) in contrast to the Carolingian minuscule (around 780 – 12th century)
*Gothic majuscule (13th and 14th century), in contrast to the early Gothic (end of 11th to 13th century), Gothic (14th century), and late Gothic (16t  century) minuscules.

Traditionally, certain letters were rendered differently according to a set of rules. In particular, those letters that began sentences or nouns were made larger and often written in a distinct script. There was no fixed capitalisation system until the early 18th century. The English language eventually dropped the rule for nouns, while the German language keeps it.

Similar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form (that is, characterised by ascenders and descenders) in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the Uspenski Gospels (MS 461) in the year 835. The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today).

===Type cases===
The individual type blocks used in hand typesetting are stored in shallow wooden or metal drawers known as &quot;type cases&quot;. Each is subdivided into a number of compartments (&quot;boxes&quot;) for the storage of different individual letters.

The &quot;Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Advanced Proportional Principles&quot; (reprinted 1952) indicates that &quot;case&quot; in this sense (referring to the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade) was first used in English in 1588. Originally one large case was used for each typeface, then &quot;divided cases&quot;, pairs of cases for majuscules and minuscules, were introduced in the region of today&#x27;s Belgium by 1563, England by 1588, and France before 1723.

The terms &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; case originate from this division. By convention, when the two cases were taken out of the storage rack and placed on a rack on the compositor&#x27;s desk, the case containing the capitals and small capitals stood at a steeper angle at the back of the desk, with the case for the small letters, punctuation, and spaces being more easily reached at a shallower angle below it to the front of the desk, hence upper and lower case.

Though pairs of cases were used in English-speaking countries and many European countries in the seventeenth century, in Germany and Scandinavia the single case continued in use.

Various patterns of cases are available, often with the compartments for lower-case letters varying in size according to the frequency of use of letters, so that the commonest letters are grouped together in larger boxes at the centre of the case. The compositor takes the letter blocks from the compartments and places them in a composing stick, working from left to right and placing the letters upside down with the nick to the top, then sets the assembled type in a galley.

<text>The Admirable Crichton is a comic stage play written in 1902 by J. M. Barrie.

==Origins==
Barrie took the title from the sobriquet of a fellow Scot, the polymath James Crichton, a 16th-century genius and athlete. The epigram-loving Ernest is probably a caricature of the title character in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. The plot may derive from &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Eiland&quot;, an 1896 German play by Ludwig Fulda. In this, &quot;a satire upon modern super-culture in its relation to primal nature&quot;, a group of Berlin officials (including a capitalist, a professor and a journalist) are shipwrecked on an island, where a secretary, Arnold, becomes the natural leader of the group. The contemporary critic Arthur Bingham Walkley, however, viewed the connection as merely a rumour: &quot;I feel quite indifferent as to its accuracy of fact&quot;.

==Characters==
==Synopsis==

=== Act One ===
Act one is set in Loam Hall, the household of the Earl of Loam, a British peer, with Crichton being his butler. Loam considers the class divisions in British society to be artificial. He promotes his views during tea parties, where servants mingle with his aristocratic guests, to the embarrassment of all. Crichton particularly disapproves, considering the class system to be &quot;the natural outcome of a civilised society&quot;.

=== Act Two ===
Loam, his family and friends, and Crichton are shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. The resourceful Crichton is the only one of the party with any practical knowledge, and he assumes, initially with reluctance, the position of leader. This role begins to take on sinister tones when he starts training Ernest, one of the young aristocrats with them, to break a liking for laboured epigrams by putting his head in a bucket of water whenever he makes one. Crichton&#x27;s social betters at first resist his growing influence and go their separate ways, but in a pivotal scene they return, showing their acquiescence by accepting the food Crichton alone has been able to find and cook.

=== Act Three ===
In act three, the play has advanced two years. Crichton has civilised the island with farming and house building and now, called &quot;the Guv.&quot;, is waited on with the trappings and privileges of power, just as his master had been in Britain. Lady Mary, Loam&#x27;s daughter, falls in love with him, forgetting her engagement to Lord Brocklehurst at home. Just as she and Crichton are about to be married by a clergyman who was shipwrecked with them, the sound of a ship&#x27;s gun is heard. After a moment&#x27;s temptation not to reveal their whereabouts, Crichton makes the conventionally decent choice and launches a signal. As the rescuers greet the castaways, he resumes his status as butler.

=== Act Four ===
Subtitled &quot;The Other Island&quot;, the final act is set back at Loam Hall, where the status quo ante has returned uneasily. The Loams and their friends are embarrassed by Crichton&#x27;s presence, since Ernest has published a false account of events on the island, presenting himself and Lord Loam in key roles. Lady Brocklehurst, Lord Brocklehurst&#x27;s mother, quizzes the family and servants about events on the island, suspecting that Lady Mary might have been unfaithful to Lord Brocklehurst. The household evades these questions, except for a final one when Lady Mary reacts with shock – &quot;Oh no, impossible...&quot; – to the suggestion that Crichton might become butler at her married household. To protect her, Crichton explains the impossibility is due to his leaving service, and the play ends with his and Lady Mary&#x27;s regretful final parting.

==Analysis==
The play deals with serious class issues that were controversial at the time. Barrie had considered a more controversial resolution – particularly an upbeat ending with Crichton and Lady Mary continuing their relationship – but decided &quot;the stalls wouldn&#x27;t stand it&quot;.

==Productions==

It was produced by Charles Frohman and opened at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London on 4 November 1902, running for an extremely successful 828 performances. It starred H. B. Irving as Crichton and Irene Vanbrugh as Lady Mary Lasenby.

In 1903, the play was produced on Broadway by Frohman, starring William Gillette as Crichton and Sybil Carlisle as Lady Mary. In Summer 1932, a Royal Command Performance of the play was held in Edinburgh.

George C. Tyler revived it at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York in 1931 starring Walter Hampden as Crichton, Hubert Bruce at the Earl of Loam and Fay Bainter as Lady Mary Lasenby.

The play was staged by the Edinburgh Gateway Company in 1957.

In 1985 the play was staged at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Hugh Quarshie as Crichton, Janet McTeer as Lady Mary Lasenby, Amanda Donohoe as Lady Catherine Lasenby and Avril Elgar as Mrs. Perkins.

The play was revived in London in 1988 with Edward Fox as Crichton, and the newly knighted Rex Harrison as Lord Loam. Harrison&#x27;s mentor Gerald du Maurier played the nephew in the original production.

==In other media==

===Television versions===
There have been two television versions of the play. The first BBC production was performed live twice in 1950, and was not recorded. The second was a 1968 American TV movie.

===Radio adaptations===
In 2011, it was adapted as a &quot;Saturday Play&quot; for BBC Radio 4, starring Russell Tovey as Crichton.

A spoof version was made for series 3 of &quot;Round the Horne&quot;. It was called &quot;The Admirable Loombucket&quot;, with Kenneth Williams in the Crichton role.

===Film adaptations===
A 1918 film was directed by G. B. Samuelson. A 1957 film starred Kenneth More, Sally Ann Howes, and Cecil Parker.

====Indirect adaptations====

The play was also filmed in less faithful forms: 
* 1919 Cecil B. De Mille silent film, &quot;Male and Female&quot;
* 1933 French film, &quot;Charlemagne&quot;
* 1934 Bing Crosby film, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot; 
* 1936 Chinese film, &quot;Back to Nature&quot;, written and directed by Sun Yu
* 2022 film, &quot;Triangle of Sadness&quot;

==Cultural impact==
* Basil Fawlty refers to Manuel as &quot;the admirable Crichton&quot; in the Fawlty Towers episode &quot;The Germans&quot;.
* Crichton formed the basis for Kryten as the name for the mechanoid servant in the British science fiction television series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.
* There was a spoof of The Admirable Crichton on the twelfth series of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; on the BBC called &quot;The Amirable Brighton&quot; in episode two.

<text>Ferdinand Léopold Oyono (14 September 1929 – 10 June 2010) was a diplomat, politician and author from Cameroon.

His literary work is recognised for a sense of irony that reveals how easily people can be fooled. Writing in French in the 1950s, Oyono had only a brief literary career, but his anti-colonialist novels are considered classics of 20th century African literature; his first novel, &quot;Une vie de boy&quot;—published in 1956 and later translated as &quot;Houseboy&quot;—is considered particularly important.

Beginning in the 1960s, Oyono had a long career of service as a diplomat and as a minister in the government of Cameroon. As one of President Paul Biya&#x27;s top associates, he ultimately served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 1997 and then as Minister of State for Culture from 1997 to 2007. He was also Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978.

==Diplomatic and political career==
Oyono was born near Ebolowa in the South Province of Cameroon. After obtaining his secondary education in Yaoundé, Oyono studied in Paris. Following Cameroon&#x27;s independence, Oyono was a member of the Cameroonian delegation to the United Nations in 1960, when the country was admitted to the UN. Oyono subsequently served as Cameroon&#x27;s ambassador to various countries from 1965 to 1974. He was briefly the Ambassador to Liberia in 1965, then served as ambassador to the Benelux countries and the European Communities from 1965 to 1968 and as ambassador to France, with additional accreditation for Spain, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, from 1969 to 1974. From 1974 to 1982 he was Cameroon&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations; he acted as President of the United Nations Security Council in place of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ivor Richard at the 1,866th meeting of the Security Council on 16 December 1975, and was Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978. From 1982 to 1985 he again served as ambassador to various countries: first as ambassador to Algeria and Libya, then as ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries.

In 1985, President Paul Biya recalled Oyono from London and appointed him as Secretary-General of the Presidency of Cameroon. Oyono remained in the post for about a year before Biya instead appointed him as Minister of Town Planning and Housing in 1986. The post of Secretary-General of the Presidency was historically very powerful, but Oyono&#x27;s stint in the office was associated with a weakening of it under President Biya; significantly, Oyono was moved from the Secretariat-General to an ordinary ministry—effectively a demotion. Although Oyono was dismissed from the government in 1990, he was subsequently appointed as Minister of Foreign Relations on 27 November 1992, serving in that position until he was instead named Minister of State for Culture on 8 December 1997. Oyono was a member of the National Commission for the co-ordination of President Biya&#x27;s re-election campaign in the October 2004 presidential election and was the president of the campaign&#x27;s support and follow-up committee in the South Province.

After nearly ten years as Minister of State for Culture, Oyono was dismissed from the government on 7 September 2007. Oyono was thought to be a close friend of Paul Biya, and observers attributed his departure from the government to his advanced age and poor health. He had been criticised for reportedly not working at his ministry for months at a time. After leaving the government, Oyono was thought to retain a great deal of influence as &quot;an unofficial adviser&quot; to Biya. Biya appointed him as a roving ambassador on 30 June 2009.

As the representative of President Biya, Oyono attended a play commemorating Cameroon&#x27;s independence struggle and the country&#x27;s subsequent reunification on 14 May 2010; the play was part of festivities marking Cameroon&#x27;s 50th year of independence from France.

During a visit to Cameroon by Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the 80-year-old Oyono died suddenly in Yaoundé on 10 June 2010. Reportedly Oyono fell ill at the presidential palace after a reception for the Secretary-General; he received immediate medical attention and an ambulance was called, but he quickly died. Later in the day, President Biya released a statement expressing sadness regarding Oyono&#x27;s death, although the statement gave no details. Secretary-General Ban, meanwhile, expressed sadness during a speech to the National Assembly of Cameroon.

An official funeral was held for Oyono with a series of events beginning on 24 June 2010 and concluding with his burial at Ngoazip, near Ebolowa, on 26 June.

==Novels==
Oyono&#x27;s novels were written in French in the late 1950s and were only translated into English a decade or two afterward.
*&quot;Une vie de boy&quot; (Paris, 1956; translated as &quot;Houseboy&quot; in 1966), a diary-form novel that criticised the morality of colonialism
*&quot;Le Vieux Nègre et la médaille&quot; (Paris, 1956; translated as &quot;The Old Man and the Medal&quot; in 1967)
*&quot;Chemin d&#x27;Europe&quot; (1960; translated as &quot;Road to Europe&quot; in 1989)

<text>Newcastle Emlyn () is a town and community on the River Teifi, in West Wales. The community is wholly in Carmarthenshire, but the built up area also includes Adpar north of the Teifi, which is in Ceredigion. Adpar was formerly called Trefhedyn and was historically a borough in its own right. Newcastle Emlyn grew around its castle, which dates from the 13th century. At the 2021 census the community had a population of 1,144. The built up area (including Adpar) had a population of 1,883 at the 2011 census.

==History==
The town takes its name from the cantref of Emlyn, an administrative district in medieval Dyfed.

Newcastle Emlyn Castle, was first mentioned in Brut y Tywysogion in 1215, when it was seized by Llewelyn the Great (). It was captured by the Welsh during the revolt of 1287–1288 and also by Owain Glyndŵr in 1403.

Cawdor Hall was completed in 1892.

The Teifi Valley Railway is nearby, although the town has not had a passenger train service since 1952.

Newcastle Emlyn hosted the Urdd National Eisteddfod in 1981.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Newcastle Emlyn, at community (town) and county level: Newcastle Emlyn Town Council (Cynfor Tref Castell Newydd Emlyn) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council meets at Cawdor Hall on Market Square. North of the Teifi, Adpar forms part of the community of Llandyfriog in Ceredigion. As well as Llandyfriog, the Newcastle Emlyn community is also bordered by those of Llangeler and Cenarth, both of which are in Carmarthenshire.

===Administrative history===
Newcastle Emlyn was historically part of the ancient parish of Cenarth. Newcastle Emlyn and Adpar have always been administratively separate for local government purposes, although between 1832 and 1885 Newcastle Emlyn was in the Adpar parliamentary borough, which formed part of the Cardigan Boroughs constituency.

When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, Cenarth was given a parish council and included in the Newcastle Emlyn Rural District. In 1897 part of the parish of Cenarth was converted into an urban district called Newcastle Emlyn.

Newcastle Emlyn Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Newcastle Emlyn was created covering the area of the former urban district, with its community council taking the name Newcastle Emlyn Town Council. District-level functions passed to the new Carmarthen District Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. The district of Carmarthen and county of Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council.

==Economy==
In 1932, the former Co-operative creamery was reopened by Dried Milk Products to make cheese. After a new parent firm, Unigate, decided to sell off its non-milk related dairies, it was bought by the Milk Marketing Board in 1979, but closed again in 1983.

==Transport==
In 1895, the Teifi Valley Railway of the Great Western Railway (GWR) reached Newcastle Emlyn railway station. Originally conceived as a 7 ft, ¼ inch broad-gauge line between Carmarthen and Cardigan by the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway, it was absorbed into the GWR, which developed the line only as far as Newcastle Emlyn.

Passenger services ceased in 1952, but goods services continued until 1973, due in part to milk train services to the cheese-producing creamery. After the goods service ceased, the lines were removed and the station demolished.

==Demography==
According to the United Kingdom census 2011 Newcastle Emlyn had a population of 1,883, including Adpar on the Ceredigion side of the River Teifi. A 2017 population estimate put it at 1,888, of whom 52 per cent were female and 48 per cent male, with 379 aged 0–17 years, 979 aged 18–64, and 530 aged over 65.

The 2001 UK census had 69 per cent of the 950 people then living in Newcastle Emlyn speaking fluent Welsh, although the proportion fell in the next decade to 54 per cent, as the town population increased to 1,138 aged 3 or over by 2011. The drop in Welsh usage in Newcastle Emlyn between 2001 and 2011 was among the biggest in Wales, though not uncommon across Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire.

The latest Estyn inspection report in 2012 on the town&#x27;s English-medium secondary school notes that only 12 per cent of pupils came from homes where Welsh is spoken, with 31 per cent considered fluent in the language. Parents have the option of sending their children to a designated Welsh-medium secondary school, Ysgol Bro Teifi in Llandysul, Ceredigion. Only 64.8 per cent of the town&#x27;s residents were born in Wales.

The town has a dual-language primary school, and also a pre-school establishment known as Meithrinfa Teifi Tots Nursery.

==Education and culture==
Newcastle Emlyn has a secondary school, Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn. The town&#x27;s attractions include an art gallery, the Attic Theatre company and the National Woollen Museum. 

==Sports==
Newcastle Emlyn has association football and rugby teams. Newcastle Emlyn Football Club are members of the Football Association of Wales and Newcastle Emlyn RFC of the Welsh Rugby Union.

==Legend==

A legend of the &quot;Wyvern of Newcastle Emlyn&quot; (Gwiber Castell Newydd Emlyn) tells how on a fair day when the town was full, a winged wyvern breathing fire and smoke landed on the castle walls, stared threateningly, then settled down to sleep. The general terror gave way to an effort by a few townsfolk to destroy it. A soldier waded the Teifi to a vantage point on the castle side and released a red cloak into the river. The creature, suddenly woken, caught sight of the cloak, fell on it with shrieks and tore it to shreds, but was shot in its vulnerable underparts. The assailant escaped to safety. The dying wyvern turned over and floated down the river, its wound gushing venom that fouled the water and killed all the fish. There was joy at the monster&#x27;s death.

==Twin town==
Newcastle Emlyn is twinned with Plonévez-Porzay in Brittany, France.

<doc id="625139" wikidata="Q716811" url="?curid=625139" title="Hermogenes of Priene">
<text>Hermogenes of Priene (late 3rd - early 2nd century BC) was a Hellenistic architect, best known for designing a temple of Artemis Leukophryene (&quot;Artemision&quot;) at Magnesia in Lydia, an Ionian colony on the banks of the Maeander river in Anatolia.

== Biography ==
Hermogenes was a citizen of Priene in Ionia. He is considered the most important architect of the Ionic style. Around 150 BC, Hermogenes codified the rules for the Ionic order in books, which were then passed down to the Romans, particularly the 1st-century Roman architect Vitruvius (&quot;De architectura&quot;, books iii, 2 and 6). Among his opinions were that the Doric style should not be used for building temples; he transformed the Dionysian temple (likely at Teos) which had been built in the Doric style to the Ionic. 

Hermogenes&#x27; rules on symmetry and proportion define what Vitruvius calls &quot;eustyle&quot; (&quot;eu stylos&quot; &quot;right column&quot;), an architectural ideal that prescribed a series of proportional relationships for temples that was all derived from the diameter of the column, as a module or unit of measure. Ideal &quot;eustyle&quot; intercolumniation (the space between the columns) should be two-and-a-quarter column-thicknesses, and the height of the Ionic column nine-and-a-half times its diameter. If the intercolumniation was to be tighter, columns should be taller in their proportions, and thicker if they were farther spaced. It is this sense of rational relations that Vitruvius is expressing when he writes &quot;in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole.&quot; One element in a classical system cannot be changed without changing the other proportions too.

The geographer Strabo mentions this temple, the third greatest temple after those in Didyma and Ephesus, but considered finest of all for its proportions.

Consequently, archaeologists have been curious to rediscover the site of Hermogenes&#x27; temple, traces of which are not apparent. Even the site of the colony of the mother-city of Magnesia in Thessaly was not established until W. M. Leake got the site correctly identified in 1824 (&quot;Journal of a Tour in Asia Minor&quot; pp 242ff). In the winter of 1842-3, a French team struggled with swampy ground and a high water table at the heavily sedimented site, and succeeded in removing 40 meters of the temple&#x27;s frieze, comprising 41 blocks, and some other architectural elements. These were taken to the Louvre Museum, but the excavations were never published. In 1887 Osman Hamdi Bey, director of the Archaeological Museums of Constantinople, carried off to Constantinople a further 20 meters of frieze blocks from the Artemision. More rigorous excavations at Magnesia were undertaken by the German Institute at Constantinople in the 1890s and by German and Turkish scholars since 1984. The result is that sculptural elements of Hermogenes&#x27; Artemision are scattered among the Pergamum Museum, Berlin, the Louvre Museum, Paris, and Istanbul.

Since the 1980s, enough remnants of the U-shaped raised colonnaded altar that faced the temple have been recovered to permit modern reconstructions of its original appearance, for the first time since Antiquity.

Hermogenes was the architect of the hexastyle peripteral Temple of Dionysus in Teos, also mentioned by Vitruvius. It was the largest temple to Dionysus in the ancient world; only the platform (stylobate) remains, measuring 18.5 by 35 meters (61 by 115 feet). It is in the western part of the lower city, against the walls. It was constructed early in the 2nd century BC and later reconsecrated to the cult of Tiberius and partly rebuilt during Hadrian’s reign. The temple has been excavated by a team of the University of Ankara.

Hermogenes also appears to have written a text, no longer extant, on his symmetrical principles. (De architectura 3.3.9)

<text>Lampeter (; (formal); &quot;Llambed&quot; (colloquial)) is a town, community and electoral ward in Ceredigion, Wales, at the confluence of the Afon Dulas with the River Teifi. It is the third largest urban area in Ceredigion, after Aberystwyth and Cardigan, and has a campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. At the 2011 Census, the population was 2,970. Lampeter is the smallest university town in the United Kingdom. The university adds approximately 1,000 people to the town&#x27;s population during term time.

== Etymology ==
The Welsh name of the town, &#x27;, means &quot;Peter&#x27;s church [at] Stephen&#x27;s bridge&quot; in reference to its church and castle. Its English name derives from this, as does the colloquial Welsh name &#x27;. An alternative English spelling occurs as &quot;Thlampetre&quot; in 1433.

==History==

The Norman timber castle of &quot;Pont Steffan&quot; (&quot;Stephen&#x27;s bridge&quot; in English) occupying a strategic position beside the River Teifi was destroyed in 1187 after it had been conquered by Owain Gwynedd and was not rebuilt.

Cardiganshire was one of the royal counties established by Edward I after the defeat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (&quot;Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf&quot;) at Cilmeri in 1282, when Lampeter fell under direct royal control. But this had little effect on the town, and the Welsh language and culture continued to thrive. The first market charter was granted in 1284 to Rhys ap Meredydd who was given the right to hold a weekly market. As many as eight fairs were also held each year under successive charters.

The town was ruled by a local aristocracy who lived in elegant mansions, including Brynhywel, Maesyfelin and the Lloyd baronets of Peterwell. As magistrates, they handed out the severest of penalties to offenders. The fairs and markets had become rowdy occasions with violence and drunkenness, and the stocks and whipping post in front of Lampeter Town Hall were frequently put to use in the 18th century.

The town developed the crafts, services and industries to cater to the needs of the rural area. There were several woollen mills, one of which in the mid-18th century was already producing the complex double-woven tapestry cloth later to become associated with the Welsh woollen industry. There were also blacksmiths, a leather tannery, carpenters, saddlers, bootmakers and hatters. The town was one of the main centres on the Welsh drovers&#x27; road which carried cattle and sheep on foot to the markets in England. A large number of inns point to the town&#x27;s importance as a rural centre.

Lampeter&#x27;s war memorial, sculpted by Sir William Goscombe John (1860–1952), was unveiled in September 1921.

==University==
St David&#x27;s College was founded in Lampeter in 1822 by Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St David&#x27;s, to provide training for those wishing to join the Anglican priesthood. It was the first institution of higher education in Wales and the third oldest in England and Wales after Oxford and Cambridge. In 1852 it was granted a charter to award the Bachelor of Divinity (BD) degree, and in 1865 another charter enabled it to confer BA degrees in liberal arts. Its central building, based on an Oxbridge-style quadrangle, was designed by Charles Robert Cockerell.

In 1971, it became a constituent part of the University of Wales as St David&#x27;s University College and was renamed the University of Wales, Lampeter, in 1996. In 2008, the Lampeter institution&#x27;s original charter was used to reform higher education in West Wales with the integration of Trinity College Carmarthen, further education colleges in Cardigan and Llanelli, and the technical college known as Swansea Metropolitan into the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

In January 2025 Trinity St David finalised plans to stop using the Lampeter campus for university teaching and relocate its courses, staff and students to Carmarthen.

The university&#x27;s Rugby Union team was the first in Wales. It was formed in the 1850s by Rowland Williams who introduced the game from Cambridge.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Lampeter, at community (town) and county level: Lampeter Town Council (Cyngor Tref Llanbedr Pont Steffan) and Ceredigion County Council (Cyngor Sir Ceredigion). The town council meets at the Creuddyn Building on Pontfaen Road.

===Administrative history===
Lampeter was an ancient parish, which included rural areas as well as the town itself. The town was administered as a borough from at least the time of Edward II (reigned 1307–1327). A government survey of boroughs in 1835 found that the borough corporation had very few powers. The borough was therefore left unreformed when the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed most ancient boroughs across the country into municipal boroughs.

The old corporation continued to operate, but was ineligible to take on any further functions. In order to provide more modern forms of local government, a local government district was created in 1866 with an elected local board. The local board and old borough corporation then existed alongside each other until 1884, when the town was issued a new municipal charter formally incorporating it as a municipal borough. The reformed borough council took on the functions of the abolished local board. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so the parts of Lampeter parish outside the borough became a separate parish called Lampeter Rural. Lampeter Rural was abolished in 1987 and divided between several neighbouring communities.

The borough of Lampeter was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Lampeter was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Ceredigion District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Ceredigion County Council.

==Culture==

* Lampeter&#x27;s local Eisteddfod, &quot;Eisteddfod Rhys Thomas James Pantyfedwen&quot;, is held annually over the August bank holiday. It is particularly noteworthy for its competition for singers under the age of 30, colloquially known as &quot;Llais Llwyfan Llambed&quot; (&#x27;the voice of Lampeter&#x27;s stage&#x27;).
* Lampeter Museum covers the cultural and agricultural development of the town as well as the history of the college.
* Theatr Felinfach, a small regional theatre located outside the village of Ystrad Aeron in Dyffryn Aeron, about 7 miles from Lampeter.
* During the Second World War, Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin lived at Plas Gelli, a secluded mansion just outside Talsarn. The Dylan Thomas Trail links Talsarn and Lampeter with the other places in Ceredigion associated with the poet, such as Aberaeron and New Quay.
* In 1968, William Julian Cayo-Evans first marched his paramilitary nationalist &#x27;Free Wales Army&#x27; from Lampeter.
* The Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a Roman Catholic Church, is Grade II listed and is considered a fine example of mid-20th century church architecture.

== Notable people ==

* Eliezer Griffiths (1827–1920), a Congregationalist minister, worked in Australia and America
* David Thomas (1829–1905), a Welsh clergyman helped found a Welsh church in the Welsh settlement in Argentina.
* John Perowne (1863–1954), a British Army officer and a King&#x27;s Messenger 
* Watcyn Samuel Jones (1877–1964), agricultural administrator and theological college principal.
* Glyn Daniel (1914 in Lampeter Velfrey – 1986), a Welsh scientist and archaeologist who taught the European Neolithic period
* Gillian Elisa (born 1953), a Welsh actress, singer and comedian.
* Elin Jones (born 1966), politician, the Llywydd of the Senedd (presiding officer) since 2016.

==Sport==
Lampeter has a strong sporting community, which includes Cwmann and Llanybydder. Many sports are played in the town, with rugby union being the most popular. Lampeter fielded the first rugby union team in Wales. The sport is believed to have arrived in the late 1840s, meaning the town has a very long tie and history with the sport. The town is represented by Lampeter Town Rugby which is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets.

Many other sports are played in the town, including association football, with the town being represented by a football team, their pitch being directly next to the main pitch of Lampeter Rugby Club. The football team has junior teams as well as a 1st and 2nd team. The town is served by a leisure centre, which has a gym, the main hall and modern tennis facilities. The town has a swimming pool and also a bowling green.

==Transport==
In 1866, transport in Lampeter was greatly improved with the opening of the railway linking and . In 1911, a branch line opened to Aberaeron. Following the nationalisation of the railways, the passenger service to Aberaeron ceased in 1951. Passenger trains on the main line to Carmarthen and Aberystwyth continued until December 1964 when the track was badly damaged by flooding south of Aberystwyth and through trains were suspended. This was the era of the &quot;Beeching Axe&quot; and it took little political persuasion to decide that the cost of repairs would be unjustified. The remaining passenger services were withdrawn. Milk trains continued to the processing factories at Pont Llanio until 1970, and Felinfach until 1973. The line was eventually lifted in 1975. However, the section of the old line between Bronwydd Arms and Danycoed Halt still exists and is used by the Gwili Railway, a steam railway preservation society which operates a regular timetable during summer months.

Regular bus services operate through the town, connecting Lampeter to Aberystwyth, Carmarthen and Swansea. Two buses a day continue beyond Swansea, providing a through service to Cardiff.

==Twinning==
Lampeter is twinned with Saint-Germain-sur-Moine, France.

<text>A parking pawl is a device fitted to a motor vehicle&#x27;s automatic transmission that locks up the transmission when the transmission shift lever selector is placed in the Park position. &quot;Park&quot; is the first position of the lever (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the &quot;Society of Automotive Engineers&quot; (SAE)) through &quot;SAE J915&quot;, and in most other vehicles worldwide.

==Mechanism==
The parking pawl locks the transmission&#x27;s &quot;output shaft&quot; to the transmission casing by engaging a &quot;pawl&quot; (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main components of a parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin, and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are put in place to avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a standstill.

==Standards==
* FMVSS 114 – Theft Protection and Rollaway Prevention, Keyless Ignition Systems 
* SAE J2208 – Park Standard for Automatic Transmissions.

<text>The Meadowlands Environment Center (formerly the Hackensack Meadowlands Environmental Center) is an educational facility in the New Jersey Meadowlands in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, located along the Hackensack River. It is operated by Ramapo College of New Jersey under the auspices of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA).

In 2003 Ramapo College began working with the Meadowlands Environmental Center to develop an environmental education program, and as of 2024 the college operates the facility.

The center facilities include the Center for Environmental and Scientific Education, and the William D. McDowell Observatory. The center is located within Richard W. DeKorte Park, named after Richard W. DeKorte, a resident of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, who as majority leader of the New Jersey General Assembly sponsored legislation that established the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission in 1969.

Until 2015 the Hackensack Meadowlands Environmental Center was operated by the Meadowlands Commission. In 2015 legislation was enacted that reorganized the commission, placing it within the NJSEA.

<text>New Quay () is a seaside town, community and electoral ward in Ceredigion, Wales; it had a resident population of 1,045 at the 2021 census. Located south-west of Aberystwyth, on Cardigan Bay with a harbour and large sandy beaches, the town lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path and the Wales Coast Path. It remains a popular seaside resort and traditional fishing town, with strong family and literary associations with the poet Dylan Thomas and his play, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

==History==
Until the early 19th century, New Quay consisted of a few thatched cottages surrounded by agricultural land, the natural harbour providing a safe mooring for fishing boats and a few small trading vessels. The New Quay Harbour Act was passed in 1834 and a stone pier was constructed at a cost of £4,700. Trading activity increased and new houses were built as economic migrants arrived. As shipbuilding started up, the town increased in size with the construction of terraced housing up the slopes of the sheltered bay.

By the 1840s, more than three hundred men were employed in building ships in three centres: New Quay itself; Traethgwyn, a bay just to the north; and Cei-bach, a pebble beach further north below a wooded cliff. Here were constructed not only smacks and schooners for sailing along the coast, but also larger vessels for sailing to the Americas and Australia. At that time, as well as shipwrights, New Quay had half a dozen blacksmith shops, three sail makers, three ropeworks and a foundry. Most of the men of the town were mariners or employed in occupations linked with the sea. Several of the old warehouses remain, having been put to new uses. Lengths of chain, metal rings and capstans, and a list of tolls for exports and imports can still be seen outside the harbourmaster&#x27;s office.

By 1870, shipbuilding had ceased at New Quay but most of the men living there still went to sea. There were navigation schools in the town and many of the last square riggers that sailed the world were captained by New Quay men. Between 1850 and 1927, the Board of Trade issued 1,380 Merchant Master and Mate certificates to New Quay men compared, for example, with 21 certificates to Laugharne men and five to Ferryside men.

In 1907, a local newspaper noted that “New Quay... has more retired sea captains living in it than any other place of its own size in Wales.” 
At the 1939 War Register, there were 58 sailors living in New Quay (of whom 30 were master mariners), compared with four living in Laugharne and one in Ferryside.

The New Quay historian, S.C. Passmore, has noted the “zeal for learning” that was present in New Quay. This was reflected in the opening of a Newspaper Reading Room in 1854, later incorporating a Lloyds Lending Library.

One of the first guides for tourists was published in 1885 by the Welsh Press: &quot;Guide to New Quay: Being a short description of New Quay as a Watering-place&quot;.

The 1904-1905 Welsh revival began in New Quay.

Coronation Gardens, at the bottom of the town next to the pier, were created in 1911 to mark the coronation of George V.

A Memorial Hall was built on Towyn Road in 1925 in memory of those killed in the First World War.

Pupils from the London Nautical School were evacuated to New Quay during the 1939-1945 War, and billeted around the town in residents’ homes and hotels. There is an extended online description, with photos, of the School’s time in New Quay in the School magazine.

There were 877 residents in New Quay shown on the Register of Electors in May 1945. Of these, 587 were women and 290 were men, figures that partly reflect the number of New Quay men, most of them sailors, who were killed in the First and Second World Wars.

The post-war history of New Quay is largely that of the emergence of the town as an attractive holiday destination.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering New Quay, at community (town) and county level: New Quay Town Council (Cyngor Tref Cei Newydd) and Ceredigion County Council (Cyngor Sir Ceredigion). The town council meets at the Memorial Hall on Towyn Road.

===Administrative history===
New Quay historically formed part of the parish of Llanllwchaiarn. A New Quay local government district was created in 1869, covering New Quay plus the old village of Llanllwchaiarn around the parish church, but excluding the more rural parts of the parish. Such local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so a new civil parish of New Quay was created matching the urban district, and the parish of Llanllwchaiarn was reduced to just cover the parts outside the urban district, despite Llanllwchaiarn village itself being within the New Quay urban district and parish.

New Quay Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called New Quay was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. District-level functions passed to Ceredigion District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Ceredigion County Council.

== Tourism and attractions ==
Key attractions for holidaymakers include the harbour and sandy beaches, as well as opportunities such as boat trips to see the population of bottlenose dolphins that lives in Cardigan Bay. The town has a heritage centre and marine wildlife centre. The outskirts of the town feature many large holiday parks and caravan sites.

The annual Cardigan Bay Regatta, usually in August, has been conducted since at least the 1870s. Events now include inshore sports (swimming, rowing, etc.) and dinghy and cruiser racing.

There are beach walks and cliff walks along the coastal path, south to Llangrannog and north to Aberaeron.

The National Trust&#x27;s Llanerchaeron estate is nearby, as is the 18th century Ty Glyn Walled Garden in Ciliau Aeron. Less than an hour&#x27;s drive away is the neolithic Pentre Ifan Burial Chamber, as well as the Castell Henllys Iron Age Village. Restored steam trains on the Vale of Rheidol Railway leave from nearby Aberystwyth, on the scenic route to Devil’s Bridge.

== Local facilities ==
As well as shops, restaurants and pubs, New Quay has a large primary school, a doctors&#x27; surgery, a small branch of the county library service, a fire station and a Memorial Hall. There is also a public park at the top of New Quay next to the tennis court. New Quay Bowling Club is on Francis Street, at the top of the town. New Quay Golf Club first appeared in 1909, but closed in the 1920s. The nearest golf club today is Cardigan Golf Club.

In addition to the hospitality industry, there is still significant employment in sea fishing and fish processing.

New Quay Lifeboat Station, operated by the RNLI, houses two lifeboats: a Mersey class named Frank and Lena Clifford of Stourbridge in dedication to its main benefactors and an inshore inflatable D class. In 2014 the station celebrated 150 years of service, during which period it made 940 callouts.

Public transport is provided by regular bus services to Aberaeron, Cardigan and Aberystwyth. The town has never had a train service, as schemes to open routes to Cardigan or Newcastle Emlyn were abandoned in the 1860s, and that from the Aberaeron to Lampeter branch line (the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway) was never completed due to the First World War.

== Dylan Thomas ==

Dylan and Caitlin Thomas lived in New Quay from 4 September 1944 until July 1945, renting a cliff-top bungalow called Majoda - there&#x27;s a photograph here:
It stood, said Thomas, “in a really wonderful bit of the bay, with a beach of its own. Terrific.” Made of wood and asbestos, Majoda&#x27;s facilities were basic: it had no mains electricity, gas or water, and the lavatory and a water tap were both outside. It was, wrote Caitlin, &quot;cheaply primitive,&quot; and they were there during one of the coldest Cardiganshire winters on record.

There were several other families from Swansea living in New Quay, who had come after the bombing of Swansea in February 1941, including the historian and artist, Myra Evans (1883-1972). Thomas&#x27; Swansea friend and distant cousin, Vera Killick, lived next to Majoda in Ffynnonfeddyg cottage, whilst her sister, Evelyn Milton, lived further along the cliff-top. Thomas also had a Swansea aunt, and four cousins, in New Quay, who had lived there since the 1920s, as well as a more distant relative, the First World War fighter pilot ace, James Ira Thomas Jones, aka Ira Taffy Jones.

Thomas had previously visited New Quay in the 1930s and then again in 1942–43 when he and Caitlin had lived a few miles away at Plas Gelli, Talsarn. His New Quay pub poem &quot;Sooner than you can water milk&quot; dates from this period, as does his script for the filming of Cardigan Bay for the final part of &quot;Wales - Green Mountain, Black Mountain&quot;.

One of Thomas&#x27;s patrons was Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden, whose summer residence was Plas Llanina, an historic manor house perched on the cliffs at Cei Bach, just a short walk away from Majoda. He encouraged Thomas to use the old apple house at the bottom of the manor&#x27;s walled garden as a quiet place in which to write. It would have been an inspirational setting, and one Dylan Thomas scholar has suggested that the stories about Llanina&#x27;s drowned houses and cemetery are &quot;the literal truth that inspired the imaginative and poetic truth&quot; of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Another important aspect of that literal truth was the 60 acres of cliff-top between Majoda and New Quay that fell into the sea in the early 1940s.

New Quay, said Caitlin, was exactly Thomas&#x27;s kind of place, &quot;with the ocean in front of him...and a pub where he felt at home in the 
evenings” and he was happy there, as his letters reveal. His ten months at Majoda were the most fertile period of his adult life, a second flowering said his first biographer, Constantine FitzGibbon, &quot;with a great outpouring of poems.&quot; These Majoda poems, including making a start on &quot;Fern Hill&quot;, provided nearly half the poems of &quot;Deaths and Entrances&quot;, published in 1946. There were four film scripts as well, and a radio script, &quot;Quite Early One Morning,&quot; about a walk around New Quay. This radio script has been described by Professor Walford Davies as &quot;a veritable storehouse of phrases, rhythms and details later resurrected or modified for &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.&quot; Not since his late teenage years had Thomas written so much. His second biographer, Paul Ferris, concluded that &quot;on the grounds of output, the bungalow deserves a plaque of its own.&quot; Thomas’s third biographer, George Tremlett, concurred, describing the time in New Quay as “one of the most creative periods of Thomas’s life.”

New Quay is often cited as an inspiration for the village of Llareggub in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Walford Davies, for example, has concluded that New Quay &quot;was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.&quot;
FitzGibbon had come to a similar conclusion, noting that &quot;Llareggub resembles New Quay more closely [than Laugharne] and many of the characters derive from that seaside village in Cardiganshire...&quot; Writing in January 1954, just days before the first BBC broadcast of the play, its producer, Douglas Cleverdon, noted that Thomas &quot;wrote the first half within a few months; then his inspiration seemed to fail him when he left New Quay...&quot; And one of Thomas&#x27;s closest friends, Ivy Williams of Brown&#x27;s Hotel, Laugharne, has said &quot;Of course, it wasn&#x27;t really written in Laugharne at all. It was written in New Quay, most of it.&quot; Jack Patrick Evans, landlord of the Black Lion in New Quay, has provided an account of Thomas gathering material for the play in the pub: “...he seemed to do his best writing among us local people – he was always with a pad on his knees...Always busy, making notes of any local characters who came in.&quot; 

Thomas&#x27;s sketch of Llareggub is now online at the National Library of Wales. The Dylan Thomas scholar, James Davies, has written that &quot;Thomas&#x27;s drawing of Llareggub is...based on New Quay.&quot; There&#x27;s been very little disagreement, if any, with this view. A recent analysis of the sketch has revealed that Thomas used the name of an actual New Quay resident, Cherry Jones, for one of the people living in Cockle Street. There’s more on New Quay&#x27;s Cherry Jones and Llareggub’s Cherry Owen online here:

Thomas also drew upon other New Quay residents, including Mrs Ogmore Davies and Mrs Pritchard-Jones, both of Church Street, whose names when combined produce Llareggub’s Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard.

Jack Lloyd Evans, a New Quay postman and the Town Crier, also lived on Church Street. He provided the character of Llareggub&#x27;s postman, Willy Nilly, whose practice of opening letters, and spreading the news, reflects Lloyd&#x27;s role as Town Crier, as Thomas himself noted: &quot;Nobody minds him opening the letters and acting as [a] kind of town-crier. How else could they know the news?&quot; This work sheet note, together with our knowledge that Thomas knew Jack Lloyd (&quot;an old friend&quot;), make the link between Lloyd and Llareggub’s Willy Nilly.

There were also other New Quay people in the play, including Dai Fred Davies, the donkeyman on board the fishing vessel, the Alpha. He appears in the play as Tom-Fred the donkeyman.

There are, too, New Quay people who can be found in the play, but not by name. Fourth Drowned’s question “Buttermilk and whippets?” is a good example: Jack Patrick, landlord of the Black Lion, kept whippets and made buttermilk in his dairy next to the hotel. There’s a photo of Jack with one of his whippets here:

At the beginning of the play, Third Drowned asks: “How’s the tenors in Dowlais?” The question reflects the close relationship that once existed between New Quay and Dowlais, an industrial town in the South Wales valleys. Its workers traditionally came to New Quay for their holidays, and often sang on the pier on summer evenings. Such was the relationship between the two towns that when St Mair’s church in Dowlais was demolished in 1963, its bell was given to New Quay&#x27;s parish church.

Other names and features from New Quay in the play include Maesgwyn farm, the Sailor&#x27;s Home Arms, the river Dewi, the quarry, the harbour, Manchester House, the hill of windows and the Downs.

Llareggub&#x27;s occupational profile as a town of seafarers, fishermen, cocklers and farmers has been examined through an analysis of the 1939 War Register, comparing the returns for New Quay with those for Laugharne, Ferryside and Llansteffan. It shows that New Quay and Ferryside provide by far the best fit with Llareggub&#x27;s occupational profile.

The writer and puppeteer, Walter Wilkinson, visited New Quay in 1947; his essay on the town captures its character and atmosphere as Thomas would have found it two years earlier. There is, too, an online 1959 ITV film of the town and its people during the summer holiday season.

Much of the location filming for &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;, a 2008 film based around Thomas and Caitlin&#x27;s friendship with Vera Killick, was carried out in and around New Quay. It starred Sienna Miller, Keira Knightley, Matthew Rhys and Cillian Murphy. The film, said the scriptwriter, Sharman Macdonald, was a work of fiction: it was &quot;not true, it&#x27;s surmise on my part, it&#x27;s a fiction… I made it up.&quot; One incident in the film that Macdonald did not make up was the shooting at Majoda in March 1945, after which Vera&#x27;s husband, William Killick, was charged with attempted murder and later acquitted.

The Dylan Thomas Trail runs through Ceredigion, in west Wales, with a published walking guide available. It was officially opened by Dylan and Caitlin&#x27;s daughter, Aeronwy Thomas, in July 2003. The trail is marked by blue plaques, with information boards in New Quay, Lampeter and Aberaeron. Two photographic online guides to the New Quay section of the Trail are available. There are also a number of accessible day walks, including the Rev. Eli Jenkins&#x27; Pub Walk, which follows the river Dewi to the sea, passing close to the farm of the Cilie poets.

Thomas and his family left New Quay in July 1945. By September, he was writing to Caitlin about finding somewhere to live, telling her he would live in Majoda again. He came back to New Quay at least twice in 1946, the first time in March, a visit he records in his radio broadcast, &quot;The Crumbs of One Man’s Year&quot;, in which he writes about the “gently swilling retired sea-captains” in the back bar of the Black Lion. Then, in early summer, he was seen in the Commercial pub (formerly the Sailor&#x27;s Home Arms and now called The Seahorse Inn) with jazz pianist, Dill Jones, whose paternal family came from New Quay. Thomas&#x27;s letter in August 1946 to his patron, Margaret Taylor, provides a vivid roll-call of some of the New Quay characters that he knew.

Thomas also refers to New Quay in his 1949 broadcast, &quot;Living in Wales&quot; (“hoofed with seaweed, did a jig on the Llanina sands...”). He was still in touch in 1953 with at least one New Quay friend, Skipper Rymer, who had briefly run the Dolau pub in New Quay.

== Plas Llanina ==

Plas Llanina is a mile or so to the north of New Quay on the cliffs above Traethgwyn and Cei Bach beaches. It is considered a good example of a small-scale, post-medieval gentry house. It has a chequered history, including some interesting owners and various stories associated with them. It belonged to the Musgrave family from around 1630. By the end of the 18th century it had passed into the ownership of the Jones family, the last of whom was Edward Warren Jones. When he died, he left the Llanina Estate to his two godchildren, Mrs Charlotte Lloyd (of Coedmore) and her younger brother, Charles Richard Longcroft. The house remained with the Longcrofts until about 1920, its last owner being Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft (1883–1958) who had been born and brought up at Llanina. He is considered a founding father of the Royal Air Force.

Sometime in the late 1930s, the house and grounds were rented by Lord Howard de Walden as a summer residence. In the late 1940s, it was bought by Colonel J. J. Davis and Betty Davis, who later moved to Ty Glyn in Ciliau Aeron. By 1964, Plas Llanina was derelict. It was subsequently bought in 1988 and rebuilt by a London banker.

The house sits next to the church of Saint Ina, with a public footpath to both the church and the beach.

<doc id="625161" wikidata="Q1505148" url="?curid=625161" title="Sudden death (sport)">
<text>In a sport or game, sudden death (also sudden-death, sudden-death overtime, or a sudden-death round) is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner. Sudden death is typically used as a tiebreaker when a contest is tied at the end of regulation (normal) playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.

An alternative tiebreaker method to sudden death is to play an extra, shortened segment of the game. In association football 30 minutes of extra time (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in golf one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes) are two alternatives. Sudden death playoffs typically end more quickly than the shortened play alternative. Reducing the variability of the event&#x27;s duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as compromising the sport, compared to play during regulation time. For example, prior to 2012, the National Football League (American football) used a sudden-death rule that encouraged the team possessing the ball to just kick a field goal to end the game rather than striving to score a touchdown.

Sudden death yields a victor for the contest without requiring a specific period of time. It may be called &quot;next score wins&quot; or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalizing the other competitor for a mistake. Sudden death has been called sudden victory to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This euphemism became one of announcer Curt Gowdy&#x27;s idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins went into overtime.

North American professional sports using a sudden death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the National Football League, the National Hockey League and, also in a modified sense, the PGA Tour (golf). Baseball and cricket use a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death. In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a [[Walk-off home run|walk-off]], as the players can immediately walk off the field; the equivalent in cricket&#x27;s Super Over tiebreaker is referred to as the winning team having successfully completed their &quot;run chase&quot;/chased down the &quot;target&quot;.

In some goal-scoring games sudden death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins. In association football it is called the &quot;golden goal&quot;, although it was abolished from the Laws of the Game in 2004 by FIFA.

==American football==
Sudden death has been perceived as a poor fit for gridiron football because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can end the game immediately by driving a relatively short distance into field goal range and then kicking a field goal, but defensive scores such as the pick-six or the safety are much more rare.

All organized forms of American football abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. High school football and college football, never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the Kansas Playoff.

===National Football League===
Until 1940, all National Football League games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President Carl Storck announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title. This did not apply to the league championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie. Commissioner Elmer Layden approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation.

Sudden death overtime was approved for the NFL championship game in 1946. The first playoff game requiring overtime was the 1958 NFL Championship Game.

In 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in it was cut to 10 minutes. The game ended as a tie if neither team scored in overtime. When a team gets near the end zone, it typically tried to kick a field goal. An overtime game can also be won by scoring a touchdown (in such an event, the extra point is not attempted). This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range. Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a safety. In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as &quot;walk-offs&quot;, as both teams can walk off the field after the play.

Since the 2010–11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the Denver Broncos scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the Pittsburgh Steelers. A rule change gives both teams one possession to start first overtime in playoffs, whether or not a touchdown is scored first.

This rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season. It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown. In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie.

No overtime is used in preseason up to and since .

There have been three tied games in regulation during an NFL league championship game -- 1958, 2016, and 2023.

For information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see Overtime.

===Arena football===
In arena football from to , each team was allowed one possession in the first overtime, after which the leading team wins unless the score is still tied, then sudden death rules applied thereafter (a similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the NFL Europa League). Prior to 2007 the league used extra time, a 7.5-minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game. The modified sudden death rules resulted in a definite conclusion after one overtime period (only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules). From 2007 to 2019 and since 2024, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, ended with a winner. Any succeeding overtime periods were true sudden death periods.

==Association football==
Sudden death has a controversial history in association football. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however, in the era of television and tight travel schedules, this is often impracticable.

In many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of extra time were held, and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, kicks from the penalty mark are held.

To try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the IFAB, the world law-making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The golden goal rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shoot-outs would occur. As this became unpopular, the silver goal rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute; the UEFA Euro 2004 was the last event to use it, after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored.

The main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless.

In NCAA collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, used to remain through 2021, but was reinstated for the playoffs three years later. In 2005, the Division II Women&#x27;s Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match. Sudden death is still prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players.

If the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until the first team scores when the other does not wins the game. The first sudden death in a World Cup after the penalty shoot-out ended equal was in dramatic West Germany vs France semi-final in 1982.

==Boxing==
In amateur boxing, if both scores are equal and no draw option is allowed by the contest regulations, an extra round is appointed; whoever wins that round, scores the plus to one&#x27;s score, and wins the match by a slight margin.

==Badminton==
In badminton, if a set is tied at 29–all, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it.

==Baseball and softball==
Baseball and softball are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation.

Baseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after innings) cannot affect the outcome. In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as Little League), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends. If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their &quot;last ups&quot; at bat. If the hosts should exceed the visitors&#x27; score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead (if the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings will be played, and that procedure repeats until one team leads, which wins the game).

The ability to bat last is an advantage of being the home team. It is said that &quot;visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie&quot; because tying forces an extra inning.

A tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors. For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of outs that would let the game-ending run score after the out.

A scoring play that ends the game is called a &quot;walk-off&quot;, a term originally coined by Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in about 1988, who referred to game-ending home runs as &quot;walk-off pieces&quot;, as all that is left for the visiting team to do was to walk off the field. It was popularized by a sports broadcaster after 2000, and is sometimes mistakenly thought to have been so named because &quot;everyone walks off the field&quot; after the winning run scores.

A game-ending home run is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly), although prior to 1920, a batter hitting a ball outside of the park to end a game was only given credit for as many bases as required to score the winning run; if, for example, the winning run was on third when the ball was hit, the batter would be credited with a single.

==Basketball==
Basketball does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute overtime periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated.

The NBA Summer League, a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state &quot;Double overtime &amp; thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins).&quot; In the first sudden death professional basketball game, Devin Ebanks hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league Atlanta Hawks.

Another form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. 3x3, a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2 points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the &quot;three-point&quot; arc are worth 2 points and all other shots are worth 1 point.

The Basketball Tournament utilizes a target number known as the Elam Ending, which requires the leading team to score a set number of points to end the game, and has been adapted by the NBA&#x27;s G League.

==Cricket==
During a cricket match, if one team has completed all of their innings (turns to bat and try to score runs), this allows the other team to immediately win the game by taking the lead while they are batting. The winning team is said to have &quot;chased down&quot; the target score set by the first team (the &quot;target score&quot; being the number of runs scored by the first team plus one.) If the winning runs are scored by a boundary (a ball that leaves the field), all of the runs scored by the boundary are credited to the winning team&#x27;s score; otherwise, the game ends once the winners have a lead of one run. These rules also apply in the case of a Super Over tiebreaker, wherein one or more extra innings may be played by each team.

The bowl-out was formerly used as a tiebreaker in cricket. Similar to penalty shootouts in other sports, it involved both teams&#x27; players getting 5 attempts to hit the wicket at one end of the pitch by throwing the ball from the other end; if both teams tied on number of hits after the 5 attempts, the bowl-out moved to sudden death, with both teams getting one additional attempt at a time, and with the team that got more hits after both teams had had an equal number of attempts winning.

==Fencing==
An individual fencing bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (épée, foil, and sabre. Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply. Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added.

Before resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded &quot;priority&quot;. The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor.

In the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called &quot;la belle&quot;. The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point.

==Gaelic games==
The Gaelic games of Gaelic football, ladies&#x27; Gaelic football, camogie and hurling have occasionally used sudden death (called a &quot;golden score&quot;) to decide ties. Replays, extra time, penalty shoot-outs and free-taking competitions are usually used, but the golden score has been tried out in a few competitions, such as the 2006 Ireland West Connacht Hurling League, and the 2022 FBD Insurance League. With golden score, extra time is played after a drawn game, and if the game is still tied, the next score wins — whether it be a goal or a point, from play or a placed ball. Some commenters have said that golden score is more suitable than a penalty shoot-out, as the latter is a skill more suitable to soccer, and places undue emphasis on the player(s) who miss. It is widely used in underage and schools competitions, such as Cumann na mBunscol and Féile na nGael.

==Golf==
In individual match play, players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death. In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the Ryder Cup, for example. In the Presidents Cup, there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie. When this came to pass in 2003, the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk. There was no provision for an extra day&#x27;s play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy.

Traditionally, professional stroke play golf tournaments ending in a tie were played off the next day with an eighteen-hole match. Modern considerations such as television coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner.

Of the four men&#x27;s major championships, only The Masters uses a sudden-death playoff format, adopted in 1976 and first used in 1979. Through 2017 (and last used in 2008), the had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since 2018, followed by sudden-death if needed. The Open Championship first used a four-hole total stroke playoff in 1989, which was reduced to three holes for 2019. The PGA Championship uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in 2000, it introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in 1977, and used it seven times through 1996. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff.

==Ice hockey==
Sudden-death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the National Hockey League throughout the league&#x27;s history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals. Currently, the NHL, American Hockey League, and ECHL also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.

In 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five-minute overtime (but any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two). The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on-four overtime format in 2001, with the International Olympic Committee following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format. In the SPHL, a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a penalty shot instead of a power play.

If neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner. In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, alternating shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot.

During championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other. These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five-minute period with at least three players.

IIHF hockey, since 2019, repeats the overtime procedure for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period; shootouts will occur otherwise. The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round shootout procedure.

==Judo==
In the case of a tie in competition judo, the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minutes long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee&#x27;s Decision. A Referee&#x27;s Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match.

== Kabaddi ==
Kabaddi features a &quot;golden raid&quot; towards the end of its tiebreaking process, in which certain rules are modified to encourage point-scoring, and the team that scores first wins.

== Kho-kho ==
Kho-kho incorporates a unique tiebreaker (known as a Minimum Chase) related to sudden death: each team gets an additional turn to score, and the team that scores its first point faster wins. (For example, if one team scores its first point in 34 seconds during its Minimum Chase additional turn, and then the other team scores its first point in 35 seconds during its additional turn, then the first team wins.)

==Mixed martial arts==
In mixed martial arts competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as &quot;Sudden Victory&quot;, has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the reality television show &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; when the competition has consisted of two rounds. A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s first Flyweight Champion.

==Professional wrestling==
Sudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an Iron Man match when there is a tie after the time limit have expired (most notably at Wrestlemania XII when the match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit).

An example that invoked sudden death occurred in the 2005 Royal Rumble. John Cena and Batista were left, and both men&#x27;s feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat.

==Rugby league==

Drawn National Rugby League premiership and State of Origin series games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the golden point. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half.

Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no conversion is attempted if a try is the winning score.

In the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none. In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each.

==Rugby union==
In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner.

However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.

===Rugby sevens===
In the World Rugby Sevens Series, a match that ends in draw proceeds to multiple sudden death periods of 5 minutes.

==Tennis and volleyball==
In contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, tennis and volleyball require that the margin of victory be two. A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team&#x27;s score exceeds the other&#x27;s by two points.

The traditional requirement that a tennis set be won by two games sometimes resulted in men&#x27;s five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an 8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon) or, in women&#x27;s/doubles&#x27; three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule. To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game. This is awarded to the first player to score seven points. The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right.

In March 2022, the ATP, WTA and ITF announced that final-set tiebreaks in all Grand Slams will have a 10-point tie break (&quot;18-point tiebreaker&quot;, first to 10, 2-point minimum lead) when the set reaches six games all (6-6). This includes the French Open and Olympics.

== World Chase Tag ==
In the event of a tie in a World Chase Tag match, a &quot;sudden-death chase-off&quot; takes place, which consists of a pair of 20-second rounds with each team chasing in one and evading in the other. The team with the longest evasion time wins. If this results in a further tie (i.e. both teams successfully evade for 20 seconds) the process is repeated.

<text>Abergele (; ) is a market town and community, situated on the north coast of Wales between the holiday resorts of Colwyn Bay and Rhyl, in Conwy County Borough and in the historic county of Denbighshire. Its northern suburb of Pensarn lies on the Irish Sea coast. Abergele and Pensarn railway station serves both resorts.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of the name can be deduced by being the Welsh word for estuary, river mouth or confluence and the name of the river which flows through the town. is a dialectal form of , which means spear, describing the action of the river cutting through the land.

==Geography==

The town itself lies on the A55 road and is known for Gwrych Castle. The highest hill is Moelfre Isaf (1040 ft) to the south of the town.

There are views from Cefn-yr-Ogof (669 ft), Gallt-y-Felin-Wynt (Tower Hill) (587 ft) and Castell Cawr (known locally as Tan y Gopa and nicknamed &#x27;Lôn garu&#x27; (Lover&#x27;s Lane)) which is 189 metres (620 feet). Castell Cawr is an Iron Age hillfort, one of several in the area. Dinorben hillfort to the east of town was destroyed in the 1980s.

Abergele (including Pensarn) has a population of around 10,000 and is part of the Abergele/Rhyl/Prestatyn urban area with a population of 64,000. 
 The town has satellite villages such as Saint George, Betws yn Rhos, Rhyd-y-foel, Belgrano, Llanddulas and Llanfair Talhaearn.

Pensarn and Belgrano have less people identifying as Welsh than the rest of town, with 69.3% of people not identifying as Welsh in the 2011 census.

==History==


===Celtic and early Welsh history===
Abergele was the site of an important clas (Celtic monastery) and remained settled into the 13th century. A &quot;Prince Jonathan of Abergeleu&quot; is listed by the B text of the Annals of Wales as dying during the 9th century reign of Rhodri the Great, although Charles-Edwards has supposed him to have simply been the monastery&#x27;s abbot. Edward I is known to have briefly stayed there in December 1294 during his invasion of Wales to suppress the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn.

Sites of historical interest include two Iron Age hillforts; Castell Cawr at Tan y Gopa and Dinorben (now virtually disappeared owing to limestone quarrying) at St. George. On Gallt y Felin Wynt, a hill above the town known as Bryn Tŵr or by its English name &#x27;Tower Hill&#x27;, is a 17th-century windmill, partially restored in 1930. There is another Iron Age fort at Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill above Rhyd y Foel. There is also another watchtower, &#x27;Tŵr Arglwyddes Emily&#x27; or &#x27;Lady Emily&#x27;s Tower&#x27;, which is located near Cefn yr Ogof.

===Gwrych Castle===
Gwrych Castle was built between 1819 and 1825 at the behest of Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh. From 1894 until 1946 it was the residence of the Dundonald family. Gwrych Castle&#x27;s present owner, California businessman Nick Tavaglione, who bought the landmark in December 1989, put Gwrych up for auction on 2 June 2006, but it failed to sell. The condition of the property is being monitored by the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust. It is undergoing renovation.

The boxers Bruce Woodcock (in the late 1940s) and Randolph Turpin (in 1952) trained at Gwrych Castle. The film &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, was filmed there in 1996, starring Edward Fox and Katherine Heigl.

===St. Michael&#x27;s Parish Church===
In a Welsh antiquarian book from 1860, it mentions that there has always been a &#x27;local tradition or popular opinion that the original Abergele was overwhelmed by the sea&#x27; and that an inscribed stone at St Michael&#x27;s parish church (built on the site of the old clas) which was once readable but had been weathered over time read;

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Yma mae&#x27;n gorwedd, 
Yn mynwent Mihangel, 
Gwr oedd ei annedd, 
Dair milltir yn y gogledd&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Although through oral tradition, the elders believed that the weathered stone was a modern copy of the original which could be found on the other side of the wall which was far more weathered and illegible.
In 1890&#x27;s, a third (bilingual) copy was made and presented by Mrs Taylor of Dolhyfryd and the vicar, David Evans. The updated inscription (with slightly altered text) on the tombstone reads in order:

&quot;YMA MAE&#x27;N GORWEDD YN MONWENT MIHANGEL WR OEDD A&#x27;I ANNEDD DAIR MILLTIR I&#x27;R GOGLEDD&quot;

&quot;HERE LIETH IN ST. MICHAEL&#x27;s CHURCHYARD A MAN WHO HAD HIS DWELLING THREE MILES TO THE NORTH&quot;

As the sea is little more than half a mile away at this point, this suggests that the sea has made some considerable advance over the centuries.

Outside the church is a penitential stone where sinners had to do penance by standing, dressed in white, by the stone and beseech the congregation for mercy as they entered and left the church.

===Railway disaster===
In 1868 the railway line through Abergele was the site of the worst railway disaster in Britain to that time. The result of a series of circumstances, errors and failures led to loose wagons containing barrels of paraffin, detached from another train at nearby Llanddulas, rolling down towards Abergele. The Irish Mail train from Euston to Holyhead ran into them. Its leading coaches were enveloped in flame which burned occupants alive. In all 33 people died.

An inquest was held a few days after and ran until early September of the same year. It concluded that it was no accident and that the two brakesmen of the goods train to which the petroleum wagons had previously been attached were to blame, and the deaths were manslaughter.

=== Other===
Abergele Sanitorium was built just outside Abergele in 1910; it became a community hospital in the 1980s.

On 30 June 1969, the evening before the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in Caernarfon, two members of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Welsh Defence Movement), Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, were killed when the bomb they were planting outside government offices exploded prematurely.

In 2020 Abergele hosted the 20th edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; at Gwrych Castle, and in 2021 it hosted the 21st series due to the Covid pandemic restrictions in Australia.

<text>Hucknall (), formerly Hucknall Torkard (), is a market town in the Ashfield district of Nottinghamshire, England. It lies north of Nottingham, southeast of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, from Mansfield and south of Sutton-in-Ashfield. It is the second-largest town in the Ashfield district after Sutton-in-Ashfield.

Hucknall is on the west bank of the Leen Valley, on land which rises from the Trent Valley in the south and extends northwards to Kirkby-in-Ashfield. The Whyburn or Town Brook flows through the town centre. Farleys Brook marks its southern boundary. Due to the mass amount of housing and industrial estates along the southside of the town. Hucknall is contiguous with the wider City of Nottingham with the suburbs of Bulwell and Bestwood Village both to the south and southeast.

The town&#x27;s highest point is Long Hill, at above sea level, with views over the city and Trent Valley, which descends to 22–24 metres (72–79 ft) AOD, flowing just beyond most of the city centre.

The town is surrounded by farmland or parkland. To the north-west lie Misk Hills and Annesley. To the north-east of the town are the villages of Linby and Papplewick, and beyond these two, Newstead Abbey and its grounds, once the residence of Lord Byron. To the west lies Eastwood, birthplace of D. H. Lawrence and an inspiration for many of his novels and short stories. To the east of the town is Bestwood Country Park.

The contiguous settlements of Butler&#x27;s Hill and Westville often appear as distinct entities on maps, but are generally seen as parts of Hucknall. They belong to its historic and present-day Church of England parish, although the town itself has no civil parish council. The identity is reinforced by being part of the post town and by being shared wards of Hucknall.

==History==
Hucknall was once a thriving market town. Its focal point is the Church of St Mary Magdalene, next to the town&#x27;s market square.

The church was built by the Anglo-Saxons and completed after the Norman Conquest, though its medieval chancel, nave, north aisle and tower were much restored and enlarged in the Victorian period. In 1872 a south aisle was added and in 1887 unusually long transepts, while the rest of the building apart from the tower was thoroughly restored. The top tower stage and the south porch are 14th-century. There are 25 stained-glass windows by Charles Eamer Kempe, installed mostly in the 1880s, and a modest memorial to Lord Byron.

From 1295 until 1915, the town was known as Hucknall Torkard, taken from Torcard, the name of a dominant landowning family. Signs of the earlier name can be seen on some older buildings.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, coal was discovered and mined heavily throughout the Leen Valley, which includes Hucknall. This brought wealth to the town and three railway lines. The first was the Midland Railway (later LMS) line from Nottingham to Mansfield and Worksop, which closed to passengers on 12 October 1964, though partly remained as a freight route serving collieries at Hucknall, Linby and Annesley. The Hucknall station on this line was known as Hucknall Byron in its latter years. In the 1990s the line was reopened to passengers in stages as the Robin Hood Line, the section through Hucknall in 1993, with a new station on the site of the old &quot;Byron&quot;, though simply called Hucknall. The second was the Great Northern Railway (later LNER) route up the Leen Valley and on to Shirebrook, serving many of the same places as the Midland south of Annesley. It closed to passengers on 14 September 1931, but remained in freight use until 25 March 1968. The station on this line was known as Hucknall Town. The third was the Great Central Railway (also LNER), the last main line built from the north of England to London, which opened on 15 March 1899. The stretch through Hucknall closed fully on 5 September 1966, but Hucknall Central station had closed earlier, on 4 March 1963.

From 1894 until 1974 Hucknall was the seat of Hucknall Urban District Council. With the abolition of the UDC, local government was transferred to Ashfield.

In 1956 the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Hucknall was built to serve western parts of Hucknall.

==Toponymy==
Hucknall was recorded as &quot;Hokeuhale&quot; (n.d.) and &quot;Hokenale&quot; (n.d.), suggesting “nook of land of Hōcanere” (a tribe), from Old English &quot;halh&quot; (). This same tribe&#x27;s name occurs in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire. It has been suggested that the name Hucknall once referred to a larger area on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border. Two other settlements in the locality are called Hucknall; Hucknall-under-Huthwaite, in Nottinghamshire, (known today as Huthwaite) and Ault Hucknall in Derbyshire. It is likely that Hucknall Torkard marked the southern boundary of this larger Hucknall Area.

In the Domesday Book (1086 CE) the name appears as &quot;Hochenale&quot; (volume 1, pp. 288–290).

==Heritage==
The Hucknall Tourism and Regeneration Group has a mission statement to &quot;help Hucknall regain its position as a strong, viable town, attract visitors to the town, to help increase its economy and to raise awareness of our heritage to both visitors and residents.&quot;

The Hucknall Tourism and Regeneration Group (HTRG) was inaugurated in 2002. It consists of people from all aspects of Hucknall life, who have a desire to help regenerate the town, primarily through tourism, after the devastating loss of the mining industry and large portions of the textile industry. Members of the group include residents, business owners, volunteer workers and councillors. HTRG works with other well-established organisations such as the Hucknall Round Table, the Rotary Club of Hucknall, Hucknall Heritage Society, the Eric Coates Society, St Mary Magdalene Church, Ashfield District Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, Hucknall Library and volunteer organisations, to prevent duplication of work and ensure the town is working together.

The group seeks opportunities to promote the town through radio interviews, newspaper coverage, street exhibitions, events, leaflets and posters. Heritage trails have been designed, one for the town centre and a 20-mile (32 km) circular trail. To complement these trails, leaflets have been produced and free guided walks/bus tours take place throughout the spring and summer months.

The town centre was pedestrianised in 2017, and an inner relief road opened from Annesley Road through to Station Street.

==Transport==
===Railways===
Railway history in Hucknall and the wider Ashfield District involved branch lines and sidings serving the area&#x27;s collieries and factories. The town&#x27;s five stations were as follows:
*Hucknall Town was on the Nottingham to Shirebrook Branch Line and served the town. It closed in the 1930s and the line in 1968. The site is now occupied by a supermarket and its garage.
*Hucknall Central on the Great Central Main Line from Nottingham Victoria to Sheffield Victoria. The station closed in the 1960s and the site has been redeveloped. The bridge and cutting are still traceable.
*Linby in the nearby village of Linby, was on the Nottingham Victoria to Shirebrook Branch Line. It closed in the 1930s, as did the line in 1968.
*Linby (GNR) on the Leen Valley Extension Lines. Closed 1916 and the line in 1960s. Now a footpath.
*Hucknall is on the Robin Hood Line. It is the main station.

===Trams===
The town is the northern terminus for the Nottingham Express Transit tram system and has a station on the Robin Hood Line. There is also a tram stop at Butler&#x27;s Hill/Broomhill. The tram line was built in 2002–2004 and currently runs from Hucknall to the Toton Lane terminus. Since 2015, trams pass through central Nottingham to Clifton and Toton Lane.

===Bus===
Hucknall is primarily served by Trentbarton. The Threes into Nottingham and Mansfield, Connect and which serves the West Hucknall Estates and links to the tram and other services. 

The 141 hourly bus to Sutton-in-Ashfield provides a link to surrounding villages such as Linby, Blidworth and Rainworth which is run by Stagecoach.

===Road===
The town used to be on the A611, but this now bypasses it to the west with a single-carriageway road with roundabouts and access to junction 27 of the M1, some 3 miles (5 km) away.

==Education==
The National Academy was founded in 1788 by Frederick Ward and originally located at the southern end of Annesley Road. It relocated in the 1970s to a new build still on Annesley Road but at the north end of the town, near the roundabout of the B6011 road. The National School has a large science block with 10 labs and an astro-turf playing area, both opened in 2004 by Princess Anne. The school has an eco-friendly building.

The Holgate Academy is on Hillcrest Drive in Beauvale, to the west of the bypass.

Holy Cross Catholic Voluntary Academy is in Leen Mills Lane, next to Leen Mills Primary School. It is a feeder primary school to Christ The King Academy in Arnold. It was voted third best school in Nottinghamshire in 2014 and in 2015.

Hucknall Sixth Form Centre is on Portland Road, near the Byron Bingo Club, and now houses the sixth form provision for The National Academy The Holgate Academy and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Academy. The building was previously home to New College Nottingham.

==Trading==
Hucknall&#x27;s Tesco superstore opened in 2003, creating a number of jobs for the town. In 2008, the store was extended to convert it to Tesco Extra. A Tesco Express store was opened in early January 2009 in Annesley Road.

Other shop branches in Hucknall include Card Warehouse, Argos, B&amp;M Bargains, Home Bargains, Bird&#x27;s Bakery, Boots, Peacocks, Specsavers, Iceland, Aldi, Co-Operative Food, and Sainsbury&#x27;s. Independent local retailers include Branson&#x27;s DIY store and Aquatic centre, Lawrence Severn and Son Ltd, butchers, and SP Electronics computer services. 

Lloyds have branch banks in the High Street; NatWest, HSBC and Yorkshire customers now have limited service via the Post Office.

Hucknall has a Friday Market in the newly pedestrianised High Street. Ashfield District Council has additionally more recently agreed to run a Saturday market.

When Costa Coffee opened a branch in Hucknall High Street in 2014, its local job advertisement attracted over 1,300 applicants. A new branch of McDonald&#x27;s opened in November 2019, at a cost of £1,000,000, after the firm had appealed against a planning committee ban on grounds of noise, anti-social behaviour, smells and litter.

==Industry==
===Mining===
Hucknall was a colliery town from 1861 to 1986. The sinking of the mines caused Hucknall to grow into a market town in under a century. The Hucknall Colliery Company, formed in 1861, sank two shafts, Hucknall No. 1 colliery (Top Pit) in 1861 off Watnall Road (closed 1943), and Hucknall No. 2 colliery (Bottom Pit) in 1866 off Portland Road (closed 1986).

===Rolls-Royce===
Hucknall Airfield, built in 1916, became RAF Hucknall. From 1927, Rolls-Royce began using the airfield for flight tests. During World War II, the aerodrome at Hucknall launched the first flight of a P-51 Mustang fitted with a Rolls-Royce Merlin Engine. The Merlin, replacing the earlier Allison V-1710 engine, allowed the Mustang air frame to reach its full potential and achieve spectacular high-altitude performance.

In the early 1950s, the Rolls-Royce site at Hucknall developed the world&#x27;s first vertical-takeoff jet aircraft – actually a test rig, officially called the Thrust Measuring Rig, but soon nicknamed the &quot;Flying Bedstead&quot; because of its shape. The first untethered flight, piloted by Capt. Ron Shepherd, took place on 3 August 1954 before a distinguished audience. The rig rose slowly into the air and hovered steadily. It moved forward, made a circuit of the area, then demonstrated sideways and backwards movements, before making a successful landing. The flight was followed over the next four months by a number of free flights up to a height of 50 ft. There were pubs in Hucknall called &quot;The Flying Bedstead&quot; and &quot;The Harrier&quot;. Rolls-Royce&#x27;s flight test centre closed in 1971, but engines were tested there until late 2008. Some components are still manufactured at the site.

In December 1940, during World War II, a German prisoner-of-war, Franz von Werra, attempted to escape by posing as a Dutch pilot and flying off in a Hurricane fighter. He was arrested at gunpoint as he sat in the cockpit trying to learn the controls, and returned to his camp in Swanwick, Derbyshire. Franz von Werra was eventually the only German PoW to succeed in returning to Germany, when he escaped from Canada to the United States, then to Mexico and into South America, over a period from January to April 1941. His exploits feature in the film &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;.

===Textiles===
Framework knitting was once the predominant industry in Hucknall.

===Garden products===
Among the bigger firms in Hucknall is Doff Portland, one of the UK&#x27;s largest independent maker of insecticides, weedkillers, pesticides, fertilisers and garden products, sold through garden centres, DIY retailers and retail multiples, and one of Europe&#x27;s largest producer of premium slug killer pellets. It also offers contract formulating and packing services.

==Brass band==

The Hucknall and Linby Mining Community Brass Band formed in late 2008 after players from the Newstead Abbey Brass Band sought autonomy. It is conducted by Paul Whyley. At the time, the town lacked a band after Hucknall and Linby Miners&#x27; Welfare Band moved out to become Newstead Brass. It plays a parish-church concert every Christmas, and around the local area throughout the year.

==Cinema==

The Byron Cinema, an Art Deco building designed by the local architect Alfred J Thraves, opened on 2 November 1936. It originally boasted a sweeping, curved façade of Thraves&#x27; favoured sandstock bricks and Portland stone, with a vertical tower to the right of centre, faced in cream terracotta tiles. Much was also made in the cinema&#x27;s publicity of a canopy &quot;provided to protect our patrons during bad weather.&quot;

The &quot;Hucknall Dispatch&quot; newspaper was enthusiastic about the 1,189-seater facility: &quot;The consensus of opinion was that it&#x27;s a delightful house of rest and amusement, the seating being conducive to the utmost comfort, whilst the projection was without fault for the first time, so perfect has the art become in these days.&quot; Manager R. L. Kemp told the paper, &quot;The Byron projection room fills us with great pride and the management cordially invite any of our patrons who so desire to view the projection room. &#x27;Wide Range&#x27; is the latest improvement developed by Western Electric engineers. It will be remembered that Western Electric were the pioneers of talking pictures and Wide Range is their latest scientific achievement.&quot;

On 13 October 1967, the Byron closed as a single-screen cinema and the building was split. The stalls area was turned into a bingo club that featured in the Shane Meadows film &quot;Once Upon A Time In The Midlands&quot;, wherein Kathy Burke and Vanessa Feltz came to blows in the foyer. The upstairs balcony became a 404-seat cinema, which re-opened on 31 December 1967 with the James Bond epic &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. It finally closed its doors in June 2006 and was bought in October 2018 by an Irish commercial property firm, Melcorpo, for a price believed to be £360,000. The new owners reopened to the public as The Arc Cinema Hucknall. After initially planning to open its doors in October 2019, Melcorpo had to scrap the plans due to delays. Construction and refurbishment were still underway in January 2020. It was scheduled to open in March 2020 as a four-screen, two-floor multiplex cinema.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s senior football team is Hucknall Town F.C. Founded in 1945 as a colliery team (Hucknall Colliery Welfare FC), it changed its name in 1987 after closure of the pit. It rose steadily through the non-league pyramid, winning the Northern Premier League title in 2003/2004, with promotion to Conference North, just two leagues below the Football League). It reached the final of the FA Trophy in 2005. However, financial difficulties in 2009 led to demotion to the Central Midlands Football League for the 2013/2014 season.

The works football team of Rolls-Royce was formed in 1935 and has undergone many name changes. In 2009 it formed again as Hucknall Rolls Leisure F.C., and by 2013 it was competing in the Nottinghamshire Senior League.

<doc id="625180" wikidata="Q503672" url="?curid=625180" title="Magnus Lindberg">
<text>Magnus Gustaf Adolf Lindberg (born 27 June 1958) is a Finnish composer and pianist. He was the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s composer-in-residence from 2009 to 2012 and the London Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s composer-in-residence from 2014 to 2017.

==Early life==
Lindberg was born in Helsinki, where he studied at the Sibelius Academy under Einojuhani Rautavaara and Paavo Heininen, beginning with piano. He attended summer courses in Siena (with Franco Donatoni) and Darmstadt (with Brian Ferneyhough). After graduating in 1981, he traveled widely in Europe, attending private studies with Vinko Globokar and Gérard Grisey in Paris, and observing Japanese drumming and punk rock in Berlin.

==Compositions and style==
Lindberg&#x27;s juvenilia include the large orchestral work &quot;Donor&quot;, composed at age 16. &quot;Quintetto dell’Estate&quot; (1979) is generally held to be Lindberg&#x27;s first opus. His first piece performed by a professional orchestra was &quot;Sculpture II&quot; in 1982, the second part of a trilogy whose first and third sections were long unwritten. His first great success came with &quot;Action-Situation-Signification&quot; (1982), the first work in which he explored &quot;musique concrète&quot;. This piece was written for and premiered by the new-music ensemble Toimii (&quot;It Works&quot; in Finnish), which Lindberg founded in the summer of 1980. Around the same period, Lindberg founded an informal grouping known as the &quot;Ears Open Society&quot; including Lindberg and his contemporaries Eero Hämeenniemi, Jouni Kaipainen, Kaija Saariaho, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Herman Rechberger. He is a trained pianist and has performed several of his works as part of Toimii.

&quot;Kraft&quot; (1983–85), another piece written for Toimii, is Lindberg&#x27;s largest work to date, with harmonies of over 70 notes and a meter-high score. It uses traditional instrumentation as well as percussion on scrap metal and spoken word. After finishing it Lindberg found it hard to compose, and with the exception of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Ur&quot;, which he called &quot;&quot;Kraft&quot; in chamber form&quot;, he entered a creative hiatus that lasted over two years. During this time he was not only rethinking his style but also recovering from a tropical disease contracted during travel in Indonesia.

&quot;Kraft&quot; made use of a chaconne-type structure where the progression of the piece is based on a repeated chain of chords. It was this idea that served as the basis for Lindberg&#x27;s next style. He returned with an orchestral trilogy consisting of &quot;Kinetics&quot; (1988), &quot;Marea&quot; (1989–90), and &quot;Joy&quot; (1990). Though Lindberg became less interested in electronic manipulation of sound, he continued to explore the possibilities of compositional software, and &quot;Engine&quot; displays complex computer-generated counterpoint. Since &quot;Joy&quot;, Lindberg has gradually refined his style, orchestrations and harmonies. This showed itself first in &quot;Corrente&quot; for chamber ensemble (1992) and its subsequent orchestral version, &quot;Corrente II&quot;, and in Duo Concertante (1992). In these works Lindberg showed influences ranging from Pierre Boulez and Tristan Murail to Igor Stravinsky and minimalism. His symphonic work &quot;Aura&quot; (1994) reflects a newer, more eclectic style.

Lindberg has since built upon these developments, further refining his style, which now leans toward a type of new tonality hinted at in works such as &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Aura&quot;. This development has culminated in one of his most popular scores to date, his Clarinet Concerto (2002), which has a folk-like melody and rich orchestration. His recent work, &quot;Two Episodes&quot;, was premiered at the BBC Proms on 24 July 2016. It is a companion piece to Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, containing allusions to both the symphony and other works by the composer, rather in the same way that I.M. Pei&#x27;s Louvre Pyramid complements the Tuileries Palace in Paris.

==Awards and honors==
Lindberg has received a number of composition prizes, including the Prix Italia (1986), the UNESCO International Rostrum of Composers (1986), the Nordic Council Music Prize (1988) for &quot;Kraft&quot;, and the Royal Philharmonic Society Prize for large-scale composition (1992).

Lindberg became the new composer-in-residence at the New York Philharmonic for the 2009–2010 season at the invitation of the incoming music director Alan Gilbert. The Philharmonic&#x27;s September 2009 opening night gala, which was Gilbert&#x27;s debut as music director, featured a well-received new work by Lindberg, &quot;EXPO&quot;. Lindberg&#x27;s fourth and final commission as composer-in-residence was the Piano Concerto No. 2, which was premiered on 3 May 2012.

<doc id="625187" wikidata="Q694780" url="?curid=625187" title="Arnold, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Arnold () is a market town in the Borough of Gedling in the county of Nottinghamshire in the East Midlands of England. It is situated to the north-east of Nottingham&#x27;s city boundary. Arnold has the largest town centre in the Borough of Gedling and the most important town centre in the northeastern part of the conurbation of Greater Nottingham. Gedling Borough Council is headquartered in Arnold. Since 1968 Arnold has had a market, and the town used to have numerous factories associated with the hosiery industry. Nottinghamshire Police have been headquartered in Arnold since 1979. At the time of the 2011 United Kingdom census, Arnold had a population of 37,768.

Areas within Arnold include Daybrook, Woodthorpe, Redhill, Warren Hill, Killisick and Dorket Head.

==Toponymy==
Arnold was referred to as &quot;Ernehale&quot; in Domesday Book of 1086. This name meant &#x27;place frequented by eagles&#x27; or &#x27;the valley of eagles&#x27;.

&quot;A History of Arnold&quot; (1913) by Rev. Rupert W. King and Rev. James Russell explains the toponymy of Arnold&#x27;s name thus:
&quot;Heron-hald&quot;, meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) live. Which becomes over the centuries since 500 A.D. by &quot;lazy&quot; pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old.

The local topography suggests that Arnold can never have been a haunt of eagles, because they inhabit areas of rocky outcrops, which have formed cliffs: the nearest such location is Creswell Crags, some north-west as the eagle flies. However, the fish-eating white-tailed eagle (also known as the erne) could have caught fish in the River Trent, which lies south-east of Arnold, on the other side of the Mapperley Plains ridge: these eagles might then have flown north-west in the evenings to roost in the ancient woodland area now known as Arnold. The Anglo-Saxon migrant-invaders, when they arrived along the River Trent from the Humber Estuary , might have seen these eagles—which measure in length with a wingspan—flying northwest in the evenings and named this roosting location &#x27;Erne-Halh&#x27; or &#x27;Erne-Haugh&#x27;, meaning &#x27;eagle&#x27;s nook&#x27; or &#x27;eagle&#x27;s corner&#x27;.

Arnold is surrounded by a circular ridge from the north-west around to the south-east and raised ground to the west. The town&#x27;s bowl-like topography may have given it the toponymic feature &#x27;-halh&#x27; or &#x27;-haugh&#x27;.

==History==
===Home Brewery===
Founded in 1875 by John Robinson, the Home Brewery was famous for its trademark Robin Hood logo on beermats. The name of the brewery referred to the Robinson family&#x27;s Bestwood Home Farm, located on Oxclose Lane.

29 August 1890 saw the incorporation at Companies House of the Home Brewery Company Limited. The company was re-registered as a public limited company named Home Brewery plc on 2 April 1982. The brewery remained independent until 1986, when the family owners sold it (along with 450 pubs the brewery owned in Nottinghamshire) to Scottish &amp; Newcastle for £123 million (equivalent to £ in ). Scottish &amp; Newcastle gradually ran down production by subcontracting its brewing to Mansfield Brewery, resulting in the eventual closure of the Daybrook building in 1996. The closure of the brewery resulted in the loss of around 400 jobs and around £20 million to the local economy (equivalent to £ in ). On 7 April 2014 the company returned to its original legal status as a private company upon its incorporation as Home Brewery Limited. The company is currently still under the ownership of Heineken UK, with an active but non-trading status at Companies House.

====Building====
The town&#x27;s most notable landmark is probably the Home Brewery office building in Daybrook. Dating from 1936, the current building is now officially known as &#x27;Sir John Robinson House&#x27;, houses more than of Nottinghamshire County Council offices and has a total floor area of . The entire site, including its 180-space car park, covers and is located at the junction between the A60 (Mansfield Road) and Sir John Robinson Way. The three-storey, Grade II listed building&#x27;s architect was Thomas Cecil Howitt and the illuminated &#x27;Home of the Best Ales&#x27; sign on the tower was altered to replace the word &#x27;Ales&#x27; with the &#x27;n&#x27; logo of the county council. An unusual frieze by sculptor Charles Doman along the front wall depicts groups of putti involved in the brewing of beer. Three designs are repeated in an ABCABC/CBACBA pattern. The reliefs are in a 2:3 proportion and are white casts. &#x27;A&#x27; depicts a drinking table; &#x27;B&#x27; shows barrel-making; and &#x27;C&#x27; illustrates the stirring of the brew—all allegories of the brewing process. The famed decorative ironwork gates and railings are contemporaneous and form part of the historic listing.

====King George V Park====

In 1950, the Home Brewery Company Ltd. gave the land for Arnold&#x27;s King George V Park, a permanent memorial to King George V and guaranteed for free public access in perpetuity for recreation. The green space is legally protected with the Fields in Trust charity. The Charity Commission held an enquiry that closed in December 2005 into restricted public access. Due to this ruling, Arnold Town F.C. have relocated away from the town centre to another ground in Arnold, known as Eagle Valley. In July 2014, a skatepark costing £110,000 was opened at the playing field.

====The Home Ales and Home Brewery brands today====
Lincoln Green Brewery of Hucknall, in association with Everards Brewery of Leicester, purchased the Robin Hood pub on the junction of Church Street and Cross Street in 2014, restoring it to its original name of the &quot;Robin Hood and Little John&quot;. The pub&#x27;s history dates back to 1750, and in 2015 it was named as the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) National Cider Pub of the Year, as well as the Nottingham CAMRA Cider Pub of the Year and Nottingham CAMRA Pub of the Year. It contains a shrine to the Home Brewery.

===Framework knitting industry===
Arnold was a centre of the framework knitting industry in the 19th century. It was the site of the first framebreaking incidents of the Luddite riots, on 11 March 1811, when 63 frames were smashed. The Luddite riots were a response by workers to decreasing pay, standard of living and conditions of employment in the industry as a result of changing fashions decreasing demand for their style of hosiery.

===Arnot Hill Park===
Arnot Hill Park was created in to serve as a backdrop to Arnot Hill House.

====Arnot Hill House====
Arnot Hill House in Daybrook was the home of the Hawksleys, a prominent Nottingham family. John Hawksley (1765-1815), a mill owner, lived there with his partner Sarah Thompson, who was the mother of his six children, four of whom survived. He had married Sarah Arnold, a doctor&#x27;s daughter, on 23 February 1799 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Leicester, but the marriage failed and she returned to Leicester where she remained until her death in 1846.

John Hawksley&#x27;s relationship with Sarah Thompson is clearly demonstrated in his will dated 5 June 1812 when he writes. &quot;I revoke all former wills and this is my last. I give and devise all my property of whatever nature or form the same may be to Mrs Beech and Sarah Thompson whom I appoint joint Executrixes of this my will for the benefit of my children John, Thomas, Francis, Maria, Frances, issue that are and any that may thereafter be born also of the body of Sarah Thompson (who assumes my name from the affection I bear her)&quot;. The will was proved on 2 April 1816 by the oaths of Sarah Beech widow (John Hawksley&#x27;s sister) and Sarah Thompson spinster.
John Hawksley and his business partner, the former hosier Robert Davison, had been operating a worsted mill they had built in 1788 on the north bank of the River Leen in Nottingham. After this mill had been destroyed by fire in January 1791, the two men decided to erect a new mill adjacent to Arnot Hill House. The new factory was operational before the end of 1791, but – despite its large scale and engine – was not a success. Davison&#x27;s death in 1807, followed by extensive losses in 1809, led to the closure and subsequent demolition of the mill. On 5 February 1810 in Nottingham, John Hawksley laid the foundations of another mill, whose engine had a power of , and he relocated with his family to Sneinton that year. He died on 27 January 1815 in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire and he appears on the family plaque in St Nicholas Church on Maid Marian Way, Nottingham.

One of John Hawksley and Sarah Thompson&#x27;s children was Thomas Hawksley, born 12 July 1807, who attended Nottingham High School and was articled in 1822 by the architect and surveyor Edward Staveley, going on to become a partner in Staveley&#x27;s business. Thomas Hawksley eventually became a prominent civil engineer in the 19th century. Thomas Hawksley and his son Charles Hawksley, grandson Kenneth Phipson Hawksley, and great-grandson, Thomas Edwin Hawksley (died 1972) were civil engineers specialising in public water supplies. In the early 1830s, Thomas Hawksley used a filtration system and other improvements to the water supply to greatly reduce the death rate from cholera in Nottingham.

There is a common misconception that John Hawksley the manufacturer married Mary Whittle. This is a mistake; there is a marriage between a John Hawksley and Mary Whittle on 25 October 1803 but he was a barber/hairdresser. It was in 1803 that Sarah Thompson gave birth to Maria Hawksley on 19 March. John the manufacturer died in 1815 and John the barber was still alive living with Mary a fact recorded in the 1841 and 1851 censuses. The mistake is rooted in an erroneous family tree produced in 1896 by Ida Hawksley, the wife of Charles Hawksley. The details of Ida&#x27;s tree were made available by a living descendant of the Hawksley family and the corrections detailed above, including the differences in generation, are based on parish records, John Hawksley&#x27;s will and the Hawksley family plaque in St Nicholas&#x27; Church in Nottingham.

This confusion regarding the two men named John Hawksley living in Nottingham is added to by the birth of sons to both men, in the same year, 1807. John Hawksley, the hairdresser, had a son named Edward John Hawskley (1808-1875). The son was a Unitarian who converted to Roman Catholicism and later rose to acclaim as a political radical in New South Wales, Australia. After fighting in Spain with the British Auxiliary Legion in the Carlist Wars, Edward John Hawksley was encouraged to emigrate to New South Wales. Once there he was employed as a teacher, became warden of the Sydney Holy Catholic Guild (1848), and wrote religious pamphlets. He edited and published &quot;The Sydney Chronicle&quot; (1846-7) and the short-lived Daily News with Charles St Julian before working with Francis Cunninghame as editor of &quot;The People&#x27;s Advocate and New South Wales Vindicator&quot;. From 1863 to 1870 Hawksley was employed at the Australian Government Printing Office before retiring to Fiji, where he died in 1875.

====Civic Centre====
The headquarters of Gedling Borough Council are located in the Civic Centre at Arnot Hill Park.

===Railway===

Arnold was served by a railway station known as &#x27;Daybrook and Arnold&#x27; or simply &#x27;Daybrook&#x27;. The station was an important junction on the Nottingham Suburban Railway, Leen Valley Line and Friar Gate Line. It was closed along with the rest of the lines between 1916 and 1964. The station was located on Mansfield Road (A60) on what is now a retail park. There is still evidence of the line in the form of remnants of the embankments on Arnot Hill Park (just behind GO Outdoors). In Peggy&#x27;s Park (next to Edwards Lane Community Centre), decorative markings commemorate the existence of the line by showing the place where it ran.

The nearest active railway station to Arnold is now in Bulwell. With the nearest tram stop being in Basford.

The line was the Great Northern Main Line (later nicknamed &#x27;the back route&#x27;), with trains to Gedling and Netherfield with the terminus being Nottingham Victoria. Just after those embankments a later built railway—the Nottingham Suburban Railway—joined it and ran over Thackerays Lane on a bridge on its way to Woodthorpe Park and beyond.

==Churches==
;Arnold
St Mary&#x27;s Church, of the Church of England, is believed to date from 1176. It is located on Church Lane and is a Grade II* listed building.

The Grade II* listed Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd&#x27;s current building on Thackerays Lane was built in 1964, its modern architecture – featuring a detached spire-cum-belfry – winning an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1966.

The King&#x27;s Church, formed in 1987 as Kingswell Christian Fellowship by attendants of Cornerstone Church, meets at The King&#x27;s Centre, which is located on Shirley Drive. Originally, the congregation met in a local school and then a day centre for adults with learning disabilities. The church changed its name to The King&#x27;s Church in 1996. The church purchased, refurbished and extended the former St. Gilbert&#x27;s Catholic Church building, and the King&#x27;s Church moved into The King&#x27;s Centre in 2002.

Designed by Nottingham-based architect William Herbert Higginbottom, Cross Street Baptist Church was opened in 1909, replacing a previous building – dating from 1825 – on the same site. It is situated on Cross Street, hence its name.

St Mark&#x27;s Church in Woodthorpe belongs to the Church of England and consists of around 8,500 parishioners. It was built in 1961 and consecrated in June 1962. It is located on De Vere Gardens.

Arnoldarmy is a Salvation Army corps based on High Street, which runs a second-hand shop called Sally&#x27;s on Front Street.

Arnold United Reformed Church is situated on Calverton Road.

Arnold Wesleyan Reform Church is located on Burford Street.

;Daybrook
The Church of St Paul and St Timothy in Daybrook was designed 1892–1896 by John Loughborough Pearson and its construction started in May 1893. In December 1895 the church was completed—except for the -tall spire and tower, which were added in 1897. The church was originally consecrated in February 1896 in honour of Paul the Apostle, but in 1993 it was re-dedicated as St. Paul&#x27;s and St. Timothy&#x27;s when the latter, a daughter church, was opened in Byron Street to replace Cecil Hall (which had long been used as an annexe of St Paul&#x27;s). The Church of St. Paul and St. Timothy is now a Grade II* listed building and is located on Mansfield Road.

Daybrook Baptist Church is situated on Mansfield Road. Its current building, completed in 1912, was designed by William Herbert Higginbottom.

==Arnold Market==
1968 saw the opening of Arnold Market in the town centre. Market days are on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, with a flea market being held on Wednesdays. A farmers&#x27; market is held on the first Tuesday of each month. It was a private market managed by Janet Surgey (whose deputy was Nigel Wilford) until July 2018, when Gedling Borough Council purchased it from Thurland Estates Ltd.

==Recreation==

Arnold Leisure Centre, located on High Street at the heart of the town centre, contains a swimming pool and a theatre—called the Bonington Theatre—which was named after the landscape painter Richard Parkes Bonington. The leisure centre was refurbished in 2014 at a cost of £1.2 million and changes include the installation of a canopy outside the main entrance, improvements to the Bonington Theatre and bar area as well as major redesigns of the reception area and the changing rooms of the swimming pool.

Connected to Arnold Leisure Centre is Arnold Library, which was refurbished in 2015 at a cost of £300,000. The refurbishments improved the library through: the addition of solar panels; the installation of LED lighting; the replacement of windows, heating and ventilation; new shelving; and enhancements to the children&#x27;s library.

==Healthcare==
Stenhouse Medical Centre is located on Furlong Street. The practice&#x27;s first doctor was Dr Daniel Stenhouse, who in 1886 became a general practitioner in Arnold and practised until 1897 from Ebenezer House, which was the old farmhouse at the bottom of Worrall Avenue. Following this, Dr Stenhouse moved to live and practise from Arnold House on Church Street until his death in 1916. Before Drs Graham, Jacobs and Lobb formed a partnership due to the expansion of the practice in the 1950s, there had been a succession of independent GPs. The practice remained at Arnold House until 1970, when it moved into Arnold Health Centre. In April 1991 the practice moved into its current building on Furlong Street, on the site of what was called &#x27;The Flying Horse Yard&#x27;. The practice now has six partners and 12,000 patients.

<text>Roger Allen Slifer (; November 11, 1954 – March 30, 2015) was an American comic book writer, screenwriter, and television producer who co-created the character Lobo for DC Comics. Among the many comic-book series for which he wrote was DC&#x27;s &quot;Omega Men&quot; for a run in the 1980s.

Slifer was the victim of a hit-and-run collision in 2012 that left him in institutional care until his death.

==Biography==
Slifer was born on November 11, 1954. He had a sister, Connie.

Slifer spent most of his childhood in Morristown, Indiana.

=== Comics ===
Slifer started out in comics as a member of the so-called CPL Gang, a group of amateur comics enthusiasts based in Indianapolis, many of whom later went on to careers in the comics industry.

By the mid–1970s, Slifer was working as a freelance writer for Marvel Comics. Thanks to Marvel staffers (and former CPL Gang members) Duffy Vohland and Tony Isabella, in the late 1970s Slifer was hired as an assistant editor at Marvel, where he wrote for a number of comic-book series including &quot;The Defenders&quot;. He also became a colorist. Eventually, Slifer became a special projects editor at Marvel, overseeing comics magazines published by Marvel&#x27;s parent company such as &quot;The Rampaging Hulk&quot;. During this time, Slifer worked on the &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; line, in addition to film adaptations.

In 1979, Slifer (with the financial assistance of David Anthony Kraft), under the publishing imprint Excalibur Enterprises, published &quot;Collector&#x27;s Classics #1: Manhunter: The Complete Saga&quot;, which reprinted the Archie Goodwin/Walt Simonson run of Manhunter backup stories from DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #437–443.

Slifer moved to DC Comics in February 1981, ostensibly as the company&#x27;s first sales manager to comic book specialty stores. He continued writing sporadically, most notably on &quot;Omega Men&quot;, where he co-created the extraterrestrial alien mercenary anti-hero Lobo with artist Keith Giffen. Slifer served as an editor at DC from 1984–1985 and oversaw the &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; reprint series, &quot;New Talent Showcase&quot;, and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;. Slifer left DC after clashing with the company about its stance regarding creators&#x27; rights. Slifer had been involved in the creators&#x27; rights issue since the late 1970s.

=== Animation ===
After leaving DC, Slifer found work with Sunbow Entertainment, an animation production company with ties to Marvel Comics and Marvel Productions. Slifer eventually became a supervising producer, story editor, and writer for the animated television program &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;. He produced and was story editor on other animated series including &quot;G.I. Joe Extreme&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony &#x27;n Friends&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Conan the Adventurer&quot;, and &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot;. During his time at Sunbow, Slifer&#x27;s colleagues included former Marvel Comics writers Steve Gerber and Marv Wolfman.

Slifer co-produced the first season of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; for 4Kids Entertainment in the United States.

=== Video games ===
Slifer worked as a writer and consultant in the video games industry.

== Personal life ==
Prior to 2012, Slifer lived in Santa Monica, California.

=== Hit-and-run crash ===
Early on June 23, 2012, Slifer was hit by a motorist while walking in Santa Monica, California, after spending the evening with friends. The driver fled the scene. Slifer was seriously injured, suffering breaks to some ribs, his collar bone, and his shoulder. Most critically, due to head injuries, doctors had to remove a portion of Slifer&#x27;s skull and place him in an induced coma at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

S.L.I.F.E.R., the Society for Legal, Investigative and Financial Empowerment and Recovery, was created in July 2012 to assist in bringing the hit-and-run driver to justice and providing updates on Slifer&#x27;s condition. The nonprofit assistance organization The Hero Initiative helped raise money to assist in Slifer&#x27;s legal case and medical care.

Slifer&#x27;s sister Connie Carlton took over his care, and in late July 2012, Slifer was moved from UCLA&#x27;s Ronald Reagan Neuroscience/Trauma Intensive Care Unit to Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles. At that point, he was still comatose. Slifer&#x27;s condition improved at Barlow, and he emerged from his coma. In late September 2012, he was transferred to the sub-acute care facility Goldstar Rehabilitation Services, in Santa Monica.

As of late February 2013, Slifer was awaiting surgery to replace the portion of his skull removed immediately after the crash. Carlton had arranged to transport Slifer to Indiana for further rehabilitation. He died on March 30, 2015.

== Tributes ==
Slifer had three fictional characters named at least in part after him:
* John Byrne&#x27;s robot character Rog-2000 was named as such by Bob Layton in 1974, who was riffing on the amount of &quot;Rogers&quot; – specifically Slifer and Roger Stern – who contributed to the &quot;Contemporary Pictorial Literature&quot; fanzine. 
* The true identity of Ghost Rider villain Inferno, created in 1974 by Tony Isabella and Jim Mooney, is that of a demon named &quot;Slifer, Fear-Monger&quot;. Isabella had met Slifer through a mutual friend.
* An Egyptian God card in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game, originally named , was renamed &quot;Slifer the Sky Dragon&quot; after Slifer by 4Kids Entertainment employee Sam Murakami.

<text>The Watergate complex is a group of six buildings in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. It is primarily a development of residences in cooperative ownership, but it also has a hotel and an office building (the location of the Watergate burglary, which led to the complex&#x27;s infamy). Covering a total of 10 acres (4 ha) just north of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the buildings include:

* Watergate West (2700 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments
* Watergate 600 (600 New Hampshire Avenue NW), office building
* Watergate Hotel (2650 Virginia Avenue NW)
* Watergate East (2500 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments
* Watergate North (2510 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments (two lobbies, one is North and one is South)
* Watergate South (700 New Hampshire Avenue NW), cooperative apartments
* Watergate Office Building (2600 Virginia Ave NW), the office building where the Watergate burglary happened

Built between 1963 and 1971, the Watergate became one of the most desirable living spaces in Washington, D.C., popular with members of Congress and political appointees of the executive branch. The complex has been sold several times since the 1980s. During the 1990s, it was subdivided and its component buildings and parts of buildings were sold to various owners.

In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, then located on the sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, was burgled; private campaign documents were photographed and telephones were wiretapped. The U.S. Senate investigation into the burglary revealed that high officials in the administration of President Richard Nixon had ordered the break-in and later tried to cover up their involvement. Additional crimes were also uncovered. The Watergate scandal, named after the complex, resulted in Nixon&#x27;s resignation on August 9, 1974.

The name &quot;Watergate&quot; and the suffix &quot;-gate&quot; have since become synonymous with and applied by journalists to controversial topics and scandals in the United States and elsewhere, even extending to contexts where English is not a major language.

==Location==
The Watergate area is bounded on the north by Virginia Avenue, on the east by New Hampshire Avenue, on the south by F Street, and on the west by the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway which is along the Potomac River. It is in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, next to the Kennedy Center and the embassy of Saudi Arabia. The nearest Metro station, 0.4 miles (650 m) away, is Foggy Bottom–GWU station.

===Site history===
For more than a century, the land now occupied by the Watergate complex belonged to the Gas Works of the Washington Gas Light Company, which produced &quot;manufactured gas&quot; (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other flammable and nonflammable gases) for heating, cooking, and lighting throughout the city. Gas production ceased at the site in 1947, and the plant was demolished shortly thereafter.

During the 1950s, the World Bank considered building its international headquarters here and on the adjacent site (which now houses the Kennedy Center), but rejected the site for unspecified reasons. It constructed its headquarters at its current location at 1818 H Street NW in Washington, D.C.

==Name origins==

The name &quot;Watergate&quot; relates to numerous aspects of its physical and historical context. The name &quot;Watergate&quot; and the suffix &quot;-gate&quot; have since become synonymous with and applied by journalists to controversial topics and scandals in the United States and elsewhere, in places that do not have English as the main language.

The complex sits near the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which operated from 1831 to 1924 and is now a National Historical Park. The remains of the gravity dam across Rock Creek, as well as Waste Weir #1 are at this site. Land once owned by the canal company was part of the site purchased in 1960 by the project&#x27;s developer, Rome-based Società Generale Immobiliare (SGI).

In his 2018 book &quot;The Watergate: Inside America&#x27;s Most Infamous Address&quot;, author Joseph Rodota gave three accounts of the origin of the name, based on sources inside the development team: Author and playwright Warren Adler, while working as a publicist for the developers, came up with the name; Nicolas Salgo, a New York financier who suggested the original site to Societa Generale Immobiliare, acquired the name from Marjory Hendricks, owner of the Water Gate Inn; and three local executives—Giuseppe Cecchi, an employee of Societa Generale Immobiliare, Nicolas Salgo and Royce Ward—came up with the name, inspired in part by the Water Gate Inn, and recommended it to executives in the Rome office for approval. According to Rodota, the earliest use of the name Watergate in the surviving files of Societa Generale Immobiliare is a June 8, 1961, memorandum authored by Giuseppe Cecchi, summarizing an early meeting with officials of the future John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts about the proposed project.

In his 2009 book &quot;Presidential Power on Trial: From Watergate to All the President&#x27;s Men,&quot; William Noble wrote that the Watergate &quot;got its name from overlooking the &#x27;gate&#x27; that regulated the flow of water from the Potomac River into the Tidal Basin at flood tide.&quot; That gate (near the Jefferson Memorial) is about downriver from the Watergate complex.

Another namesake, the &quot;Water Gate Inn&quot; restaurant (1942–1966), operated on the site for more than two decades before the Watergate complex was built.

===Watergate steps performance stage===

In 2004, &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer John Kelly argued that the name was most directly linked to the &quot;Water Steps&quot; or &quot;Water Gate&quot;, a set of ceremonial stairs west of the Lincoln Memorial that led down to the Potomac. The steps had been originally planned as a ceremonial gateway to the city and an official reception area for dignitaries arriving in Washington, D.C., via water taxi from Virginia, though they never served this function. Instead, beginning in 1935, a floating performance stage on the Potomac River was anchored to the base of the steps. It was the site for open-air concerts and the audience could sit on the stairs. Up to 12,000 people would sit on the steps and surrounding grass to listen to symphonies, military bands, and operas. The barge concerts ended in 1965 when jet airliner service began at National Airport and the noise impaired the venue&#x27;s viability.

The music venue was depicted in scenes in the motion pictures &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958) and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950).

==History==
===Planning===
The Watergate complex was developed by the Italian firm SGI. The company purchased the that belonged to the defunct Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in February 1960 for $10 million. The project was announced on October 21, 1960. Luigi Moretti of the University of Rome was the chief architect, and Milton Fischer of the D.C.-based firm of Corning, Moore, Elmore and Fischer the associate architect. The apartment buildings included two-story units on the first and second floors, while the top-floor units had private rooftop terraces and fireplaces. The design for the entire complex also envisioned an electronic security system so extensive that the press claimed &quot;intruders will have difficulty getting onto the grounds undetected.&quot; Boris V. Timchenko, a noted D.C.-based landscape architect, supervised the design of the grounds, which included more than 150 planters, tiers of fountains designed to create sounds like a waterfall, landscaped rooftop terraces, swimming pools, and a park. Landscape features such as planters would also be used to create privacy barriers between apartments. The complex was the first mixed-use development in the District of Columbia, and was intended to help define the area as a business and residential rather than industrial district. The Watergate complex was intended to be a &quot;city within a city&quot;, and provide so many amenities that residents would not need to leave. Among these were a 24-hour receptionist, room service provided by the Watergate Hotel, health club, restaurants, shopping mall, medical and dental offices, grocery, pharmacy, post office, and liquor store. At the time, it was also the largest renewal effort in the District of Columbia undertaken solely with private funds.

Initially, the project was to cost $75 million and consist of six 16-story buildings comprising 1,400 apartment units, a 350-room hotel, office space, shops, 19 luxury &quot;villas&quot; (townhouses), and three-level underground parking for 1,250 vehicles. The Watergate&#x27;s curved structures were designed to emulate two nearby elements. The first was the proposed Inner Loop Expressway, a curving freeway expected to be built just in front of the Watergate within the next decade. The second was the nearby Kennedy Center, then in the planning stage and whose original design was supposed to be curvilinear. Although the Kennedy Center later adopted a rectangular shape for cost reasons, the Watergate complex&#x27;s design did not change. Incidentally, the curved structures would also give apartment dwellers an excellent view of the Potomac River. Because of the curves in the structure, the Watergate complex was one of the first major construction projects in the United States in which computers played a significant role in the design work.

===Approval controversies===
Because the District of Columbia is the seat of the United States government, proposals for buildings in the city (particularly those in the downtown area, near federal buildings and monuments) must pass through an extensive, complex, and time-consuming approval process. The approval process for the Watergate complex had five stages. The first stage considered the proposed project as a whole as well as the first proposed building. The remaining four stages considered the four remaining proposed buildings in turn. At each stage, three separate planning bodies were required to give their approval: The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the District of Columbia Zoning Commission (DCZC), and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (USCFA) (which had approval authority over any buildings built on the Potomac River to ensure that they fit aesthetically with their surroundings).

In December 1961, 14 months after the project was publicly announced, the NCPC voiced its concern that the project&#x27;s 16-story buildings would overshadow the Lincoln Memorial and the proposed &quot;National Cultural Center&quot; (later to be called the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts). At the time, the District of Columbia had a height limit on all buildings except for those located exclusively along business streets. To obtain a height waiver, SGI would have to include retail office space in the complex, but the site was then zoned only for apartment buildings. Thus, initial approval first had to be won from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission.

By the time the DCZC met to consider approval in mid-April 1962, the cost of the project had been scaled back to $50 million. Because the District of Columbia lacked home rule, DCZC planners were reluctant to act without coordinating with agencies of the federal government. Additionally, many civic leaders, architects, business people, and city planners opposed the project before the DCZC because they feared it was too tall and too large. By the end of April, DCZC had announced that it would delay its decision. The Commission of Fine Arts also had concerns: it felt some of the land should be preserved as public space and objected to the height of the proposed buildings as well as their modern design. Three days after the DCZC meeting, the USCFA announced it was putting a &quot;hold&quot; on the Watergate development until its concerns were addressed. To counter this resistance, SGI officials met with members of the USCFA in New York City in April 1962 and defended the complex&#x27;s design. SGI also reduced the planned height of the Watergate to 14 stories from 16. In May 1962, the NCPC reviewed the project. Additional revisions in the design plan pushed the cost back up to $65 million, even though only 17 villas were now planned. Based on this proposal, the NCPC approved the Watergate plan.

With the support of the NCPC, SGI dug in its heels: It declared it was not interested in developing the unsightly, abandoned commercial site unless its basic curvilinear design (now called &quot;Watergate Towne&quot;) was approved, and it lobbied DCZC commissioners in late May, lecturing them on the District&#x27;s architectural heritage and the beauty of modern architecture. SGI officials also lobbied the USCFA. Meanwhile, White House staff made it known that the Kennedy administration wanted the height of the complex lowered to . Three key staff were opposed to the project on height grounds: Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Special Assistant to the President; August Heckscher III, Special Consultant on the Arts; and William Walton, a Kennedy family confidant. The three briefed President John F. Kennedy on the issue, but it was not clear who made the decision to request the height reduction or who made the request public. The White House announcement surprised many, and offended federal and city planners, who saw it as presidential interference in their activities.

SGI&#x27;s chief architect, Gábor Ács, and Watergate chief architect Luigi Moretti flew to New York City on May 17 and defended the complex&#x27;s design in a three-hour meeting with USCFA members. SGI agreed to shrink three of the planned buildings in the development to 13 stories (112 ft), with the remaining building rising to . SGI also agreed to add more open space by reducing the size of the Watergate to from and by reorienting or re-siting some of the buildings. The USCFA gave its assent to the revised construction plan on May 28, the White House withdrew its objections, and the DCZC gave its final approval on July 13. The final plan broke one building into two, creating five rather than four construction projects. Moretti later admitted he probably would have lowered the height of the buildings anyway, and thought that the approval process had gone relatively smoothly. Construction was expected to begin in spring 1963 and last five years.

The Watergate project faced one final controversy. The group Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State began a national letter-writing campaign opposing the project, alleging that the zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor in SGI. By mid-November 1962, more than 2,000 protest letters had been sent to Congress and another 1,500 to the White House. But the group&#x27;s attempt to stop construction failed, and the project went forward.

The project won its $44 million financial backing in late 1962, and its construction permits in May 1963. Construction began on the first building, the Watergate East apartment, in August 1963. The builder was Magazine Bros. Construction. Groundbreaking occurred in August 1963, and major excavation work was complete by May 1964.

The U.S. Commission on Fine Arts attempted once more to revise the project. In October 1963, the USCFA alleged that the height of the Watergate complex, as measured from the parkway in front of it, would exceed the agreed-upon height restrictions. SGI officials, however, contended that architects are required by law to measure from the highest point on the property on which they are to build; using this measurement, the building met the May 1962 agreement stipulations. On January 10, 1963, SGI and the USCFA agreed that the height of the complex would not exceed above water level (10 inches below that of the nearby Lincoln Memorial), that fewer than 300 apartment units would be built (to reduce population congestion), and to eliminate the proposed luxury villas (to create more open space). Luxury penthouse apartments, however, could extend above the limit if they were set back from the edge of the building and the 14th floor was foregone. With these adjustments, the total cost of the first apartment complex (excluding plumbing, electricity, and decoration) was estimated at $12,184,376.

===Construction===
Construction proceeded. The foundation and basement of the first building, the Watergate East, were completed by September 1964, and the metal and concrete superstructure rose in October. In September 1964, the Watergate&#x27;s developers signed a first-of-its-kind agreement under which the Washington Gas Light Co. would provide the entire complex with its heating and air conditioning. The Watergate East was completed in May 1965, and a month later the first model apartment unit was opened to the public for viewing. The building formally opened on October 23, 1965, and the first tenants moved in a few days later. Prices for the 238 cooperative apartment units ranged from $17,000 for efficiencies to more than $250,000 for penthouses, and were almost completely sold out by April 1967. The average apartment contained two bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a dining room, and a kitchen, and cost $60,000. Each parking space in the underground garage cost $3,000. The tenants took title to their building on April 8, 1966. In November, a Safeway supermarket, a Peoples Drug (now known as CVS pharmacy), beauty salon, barber shop, bank, bakery, liquor store, florist, dry cleaner, post office, upscale shops, and high-end restaurant took up residency in the retail space on the ground floor. Riverview Realty was the leasing agent for the complex.

Construction began on the second building, the 11-story office building and hotel, in February 1965. Both opened on March 30, 1967; the Watergate Hotel welcomed its first guests the same day. The 12-story hotel initially included 213 rooms, while the 12-story office building, attached to the hotel by a colonnade, had of office space. The combined hotel/office building included a health club, space on the ground floor for shops, and a restaurant, the Roman Terrace, on the top floor. Later in April, the Democratic National Committee leased office space in the building&#x27;s retail office portion.

The third building in the complex, Watergate South, opened in June 1968. It contained 260 residential units, more than any other building in the complex.

Construction on the fourth building in the complex, the Watergate West apartments, began in July 1967. Apartments in the unfinished building, priced from $30,000 to $140,000, began selling in October 1967, an indication of how popular the complex was with District residents. The Watergate West topped out on August 16, 1968, at which point the cost of the project had risen to $70 million. Construction was completed in 1969.

===Fifth building===

Controversy arose over the construction of the Watergate Office Building, the complex&#x27;s fifth and final structure. Its original design called for a structure with the upper floors set back to create more space and light. But in June 1965, as excavation and clearing began for the Kennedy Center, its advocates began agitating to lower the planned height of the final Watergate building. The general counsel for the Kennedy Center told the USCFA that the Watergate Town (the development had dropped the &quot;e&quot;) was planning a building that would harm the aesthetics of the Kennedy Center and intrude on its park-like surroundings. The Watergate&#x27;s attorneys responded that their building would stay within the agreed-upon height.

The disagreement continued for nearly two years, delaying the planned fall 1967 start to construction. Watergate apartment residents such as Senator Wayne Morse lobbied the USFCA, DCZC, and NCPC to force SGI to accede to the Kennedy Center&#x27;s wishes. In November 1967, the USCFA reaffirmed its approval of the Watergate project. When the DCZC appeared on the verge of giving its approval as well, the Kennedy Center argued that the DCZC had no jurisdiction over the controversy. The DCZC disagreed, and re-asserted its jurisdiction. The Kennedy Center then argued that the DCZC had not properly considered its objections, and should delay its approval pending further hearings. The District&#x27;s legal counsel disagreed, giving the DCZC the go-ahead to reaffirm (or not) its approval ruling, which the Zoning Commission did on November 30, 1967.

Although it appeared that SGI was winning the legal battle over the fifth building, D.C. city planners attempted to mediate the dispute between the Kennedy Center and the Watergate and achieve a contractual rather than legal solution. Three separate proposals were made to both sides on December 7, 1967. On April 22, 1968, SGI agreed to turn its fifth building slightly to the southwest in order to open up the Watergate complex a little more and give the Kennedy Center a bit of open space. Although the Kennedy Center accepted the proposal, it demanded that the fifth building include apartment units, rather than be completely devoted to office space, to maintain the area&#x27;s residential nature. The fight now moved to the NCPC. In June 1968, the NCPC held a hearing at which more than 150 Watergate apartment residents clashed with SGI officials over the nature of the final building. On August 8, 1968, SGI and the Kennedy Center reached a resolution, agreeing that only 25 percent of the fifth building&#x27;s would be used as office space and that the remaining space would become apartment units. The NCPC approved the revised plan in November 1968, and the DCZC did so five weeks later, specifically zoning the building for nonprofit and professional use only.

The fifth building was completed in January 1971. Its first tenant was the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which secured occupancy in February 1971, and its first major tenant was the Manpower Evaluation and Development Institute, which leased the entire eighth floor. In October 1972, several high-end fashion boutiques, jewelers, and a restaurant opened in a retail space named &quot;Les Champs&quot;.

The total cost of the project was $78 million.

===Critical reception===

The Watergate&#x27;s initial reception was poor, but the complex soon became recognized as one of D.C.&#x27;s finest examples of modern architecture. When models of the Watergate were unveiled in 1961, critics said the structure &quot;would ruin the waterfront&quot;. Other critics denounced it as &quot;nonconforming&quot; and decried it as &quot;Antipasto on the Potomac&quot;. As noted above, many individuals also felt the complex blocked views of the Potomac River, tended to overshadow nearby monuments and other buildings, and consumed too much open space. Some residents even felt the construction of the units was substandard. Architectural critics called the detailing &quot;clunky&quot;.

The &quot;Washington Star&quot; newspaper, however, was an early proponent of the Watergate. In May 1962, it editorialized: &quot;It is true that the so-called &#x27;curvilinear&#x27; design is at variance with most commercial architecture in Washington. But in our opinion the result, which places a premium on public open space and garden-like surroundings, and which proposes a quality of housing that would rank with the finest in the city, would be a distinct asset.&quot; The curving design has continued to draw praise. A noted 2006 guidebook to the city&#x27;s architecture concluded that the Watergate brought a &quot;welcome fluidity&quot; to the city&#x27;s boxy look. Others praised the complex&#x27;s internal public spaces. When the Watergate East opened in 1965, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called these areas opulent and evocative of the best in Italian design. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the design as &quot;sweeping&quot;, and complimented each building&#x27;s spectacular views of the Potomac River, Virginia skyline, and monuments. Many residents later said the flowing lines reminded them of a graceful ship.

===Watergate II===
In 1970, as the Watergate was nearing completion, SGI proposed building a &quot;Watergate II&quot; apartment, hotel, and office complex on the waterfront in Alexandria, Virginia, several miles down the Potomac River from the original Watergate. Although the project initially received support from Alexandria city officials and business people, residents of the city&#x27;s Old Town strongly objected. The project stalled for two years due to protests from residents and a land dispute regarding title to the waterfront land on which the project was to be sited.

The Watergate II project was eventually abandoned in favor of a much larger complex near Landmark Mall in Alexandria (a site nowhere near water).

==Individual buildings at the Watergate==

The entire Watergate complex was initially owned by Watergate Improvements, Inc., a division of SGI. In 1969, the Vatican sold its interest in SGI and no longer was part-owner of the Watergate. Although the Watergate was considered one of the most glamorous residences in the city, as early as 1970 residents and businesses complained of substandard construction, including a leaking roof and poor plumbing and wiring.

The three Watergate Apartment buildings have a total of about 600 residential units. Notable occupants over time have included: Alfred S. Bloomingdale, Arthur F. Burns, Anna Chennault, Bob and Elizabeth Dole (Watergate South), Plácido Domingo, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Watergate South), Alan Greenspan, Monica Lewinsky (she stayed briefly at her mother&#x27;s apartment in the complex), Senator Russell Long, Clare Boothe Luce (after 1983), Robert McNamara, John and Martha Mitchell, Paul O&#x27;Neill, Abraham Ribicoff, Condoleezza Rice, Mstislav Rostropovich, Maurice Stans, Ben Stein, Herbert Stein, John A. Volpe, John Warner and Elizabeth Taylor (during their marriage), Caspar Weinberger, Charles Z. Wick, and Rose Mary Woods. The Watergate&#x27;s popularity among members of Congress and high-ranking executive branch political appointees has remained strong ever since the complex opened. So many members of the Nixon administration settled there that the Washington, D.C., press commented on it and nicknamed it the &quot;Republican Bastille&quot;. The complex enjoyed a renaissance during the early 1980s and became known as the &quot;White House West&quot; due to the large number of Reagan administration officials living there.

The Watergate complex changed hands in the 1970s, and each building was sold off separately in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) (see below). Strict lease agreements, however, have kept the apartment buildings in residents&#x27; hands: In the Watergate South, for example, owners cannot rent their unit until a full year has passed, and no lease may last more than two years. In 1977, one of the Watergate&#x27;s financiers (Nicholas Salgo) and Continental Illinois Properties bought SGI&#x27;s stake in the development for $49 million. Two years later, Continental Illinois sold its interest to the National Coal Board Pension Fund in the U.K. Salgo did the same in 1986. The coal board pension fund put the Watergate complex up for sale in 1989, and estimated the complex&#x27;s worth at between $70 million and $100 million. Several buildings were sold in the 1990s (for details, see below). The property was valued at $278 million in 1991. Efficiency units in that year sold for $95,000, while penthouse apartments went for $1 million or more. Various buildings were sold again in the early 2000s (decade). In 2005, all of the retail space in the complex was put up for sale.

Little redevelopment of the site has occurred in the 40 years since the Watergate was first built. The complex still includes three luxury apartment buildings, the hotel/office building, and two office buildings. The entire development was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 21, 2005.

===Watergate East===
The Watergate East apartment building is probably the second-best known of the five buildings in the development. It became the most sought-after living location in the city when it opened in 1966.

Problems with the building&#x27;s construction became apparent shortly after its occupancy. The roof was leaking by 1968. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published reports in October 1968 that SGI refused to fix the leaks unless residents dropped their opposition to the construction of the complex&#x27;s fifth building. By 1970, problems at Watergate East led the press to dub the building the &quot;Potomac Titanic&quot;, and its residents filed suit against the developer in 1971 to correct the structure&#x27;s problems. Another lawsuit, filed in February 1970, sought exclusive access to the underground parking garage the cooperative claimed as its own, and demanded that the developer stop selling spaces in the residents&#x27; parking area. SGI filed a $4 million counterclaim alleging &quot;malicious embarrassment&quot; and five years later paid residents $600,000 to settle the cases.

The Watergate East was also the site of a major protest in 1970. In the weeks before the jury verdict in the Chicago, Illinois, trial of the Chicago Seven, political activists began planning and then advertising that a protest would occur at the home of United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell (who lived in the Watergate East). As expected, the verdict was handed down on February 18, 1970 (all the defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy but five were found guilty of incitement to riot). That night, more than 200 people rallied at D.C.&#x27;s All Souls Unitarian Church to prepare for the mass protest demonstration the next day. On February 19, several hundred protestors gathered in front of the Watergate East and attempted to enter the building. Several hundred police, bused in to prevent the demonstration, engaged in street fighting with protestors, forced them to retreat, and eventually launched several tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. More than 145 protesters were arrested. Although a second protest was expected the following day, it never emerged and police spent the day drinking coffee and eating cookies and pastries baked at the Watergate East&#x27;s pastry shop.

The Watergate East tenants&#x27; cooperative refinanced its mortgage some time after 2000, and bought the land beneath its building.

===Watergate Hotel and Office Building===

The Watergate Hotel and Office Building is one of the five buildings in the Watergate development.

====The Watergate Hotel====
Management and ownership of the hotel have changed several times since the mid-1980s. In 1986, Cunard Line, the cruise ship company, took over management of the hotel and began redecorating and refurbishing it. The British Coal Board pension fund sold the hotel portion of the building to a British-Japanese consortium in 1990 for $48 million. Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, the real estate affiliate of the Blackstone Group, bought the hotel for $39 million in July 1998. For a few years in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the Watergate Hotel was operated by the Swissôtel hotel group. But the hotel underperformed other Swissôtel operations of similar size, location, and price. Jean-Louis Palladin&#x27;s eponymous restaurant in the building closed in 1996. The hotel subsequently underwent a renovation in 2000. Swissôtel was purchased by Raffles Hotels and Resorts, and Raffles&#x27; management contract ended in May 2002.

Blackstone began managing the hotel, and put it up for sale in the fall of 2002 (with an asking price of $50 million to $68 million). Monument Realty bought the hotel for $45 million in 2004 and planned to turn it into luxury apartment co-ops. But many residents in other parts of the complex (some of whom owned the 25 percent of the hotel not sold to Blackstone) argued that a hotel would better enhance the livability of the area and challenged the conversion in court. The hotel closed on August 1, 2007, for a $170 million 18-month renovation, during which the hotel rooms were intended to be roughly doubled in size to . But the renovation never occurred, and the building sat empty—consuming $100,000 to $150,000 a month in security, heating, electricity, water, and other costs. Lehman Brothers, Monument Realty&#x27;s financing partner, went bankrupt in 2008 and Monument was forced to attempt to sell the property. No buyer emerged and the Blackstone Group regained ownership of the hotel.

The Blackstone Group transferred the Watergate Hotel to its Trizec Properties subsidiary. Trizec did not pay the hotel&#x27;s property taxes for 2008 (which amounted to $250,000), and estimated that it would take $100 million to make the hotel habitable due to the stalled 2007 renovation. The hotel was put on the market in May 2009, but once again no buyer emerged. The hotel was auctioned off on July 21, 2009 (with the minimum bid beginning at $25 million), but there were no buyers and Deutsche Postbank, which held the $40 million mortgage on the property, took over ownership. The bank began marketing the property for sale, and Monument Realty submitted a bid in October 2009 to buy the hotel back. Monument was outbid by developer Robert Holland and the Jumeirah Group (a luxury hotel chain based in Dubai), but the deal collapsed in November 2009 when financing fell through. Euro Capital Properties purchased the hotel in May 2010 for $45 million, with plans to rehabilitate it over the next two years.

Euro Capital announced its year-long, $85 million renovation of the hotel in January 2013. Among the improvements it wished to make were the addition of six outdoor &quot;summer gardens&quot; where liquor may be served. The plan would require the approval of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which voted to protest the liquor licenses unless the company reached an agreement with all the tenant associations in the Watergate cooperative. A year later, the company said its design team, led by the architectural firm BBGM, had completed a plan to increase the number of luxury hotel rooms from 251 to 348, renovate the lobby to add a bar and lounge, add a restaurant with some outdoor seating, and add a rooftop bar with a small water feature. Euro Capital also said it would seek a hotel management company to continue to operate the Watergate Hotel as an independent hotel. Construction on the new interior elements was planned to start in March 2014.

Euro Capital received the construction permits for its now $100 million renovation in May 2014. Architect Bahram Kamali of BBGM said the renovation would completely replace the electrical, HVAC, mechanical, and plumbing (fresh water and sewage) systems. The renovation now featured two new restaurants, upgraded ballrooms, and a new spa and fitness area. The meeting space, which was quite small by industry standards, was expanded to , and the ballroom enlarged slightly to . Watergate officials said the new rooftop bar will seat 350, and other internal structural changes will add nearly 100 guest rooms. Kamali said the interior would feature expensive, high-quality plaster, stone, and wood finishes, but the exterior&#x27;s iconic textured concrete balconies would remain unchanged except for repairs, repainting, and new windows. Grunley Construction would oversee all the renovations. Israeli artist and interior decorator Ron Arad designed all the metal sculptures and other work that would be featured in the hotels&#x27; bar, lobby, and other interior space.

The cost of the renovation was pegged by Euro Capital at $125 million in November 2014. The 336-room hotel reopened in 2016, nine years after it had closed.

====Office building====
The office building portion of the building contains .

In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) occupied the entire sixth floor of the 11-story building at 2600 Virginia Avenue. The DNC had occupied the space since the building opened in 1967. On May 28, 1972, a team of burglars working for President Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign bugged the phones of and took photos in and near the DNC chairman&#x27;s office. The phone taps were monitored from the burglars&#x27; rooms (first Room 419, later Room 723) at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s Motor Lodge across the street at 2601 Virginia Avenue NW. During a second burglary on June 17, 1972, to replace a malfunctioning phone tap and collect more information, five of the burglars were arrested and the Watergate scandal began to unfold. A plaque on the sixth floor of the office building portion of the Watergate Hotel commemorates the break-in. The sixth floor space, occupied by SAGE Publishing since 2015, houses a private exhibit commemorating the break-in and ensuing scandal.

The break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters was not the first break-in at the Watergate. The first break-in at the complex was the burglary of a residential unit in 1969 owned by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon&#x27;s personal secretary. The burglars took jewelry and some personal items. Woods was later accused of erasing minutes from President Nixon&#x27;s secret Oval Office audio taping system—specifically, the tape from June 20, 1972, that proved central to the Watergate scandal.

In 1993, the British coal board pension fund sold the office portion of the building as well as the land under two of the three Watergate apartment buildings to JBG (now JBG Smith), an American firm, and Buvermo Properties, a Dutch company. In 1997, they sold the office building to The Blackstone Group&#x27;s Trizec Properties division. Trizec sold it to BentleyForbes, a private firm owned by C. Frederick Wehba and members of the Los Angeles-based Webha family, in 2005. In November 2011, after 20 months on the market, BentleyForbes sold the office building for $76 million to the Penzance Cos.

In 2012, the owner implemented a multimillion-dollar upgrade to the Watergate Office Building&#x27;s lobby, common areas, and Virginia Avenue entrance. Hitt Contracting designed the renovations, and oversaw the construction.

Penzance sold the office building to a subsidiary of Rockwood Capital for $75 million at the end of 2016.

Brian Friedman acquired the building in 2019 for $101.5 million.

===Watergate South===
Among the notable people who have lived at the Watergate South is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As with the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building, but there is no urgency as the lease on the land does not expire until 2070.

===Watergate West===
Construction problems and leaks at Watergate West led the press to ridicule this building, like others in the complex, as the &quot;Potomac Titanic&quot;. On March 2, 1971, residents of the Watergate West filed a lawsuit against SGI in which they claimed their units had defective stoves, faulty air conditioning, leaky windows and balconies, and deficient plumbing. SGI said the problems were similar to those with any new building, and that it had already spent $300,000 on repairs.

Like the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building but do not need to do so until the land lease expires in 2070.

===Watergate 600===
Britain&#x27;s National Coal Board Pension Fund sold the Watergate Office Building to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in the early 1990s. The building&#x27;s office spaces were renovated in 1994, while the entire building saw extensive renovations in 1997.

&quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine owner David G. Bradley purchased the building in 2003. He renovated it once again, expanding its lobby and restaurant space.

In March 2017, Bradley sold the building to the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WashREIT) for $135 million plus ownership in a WashREIT operating unit. WashREIT said it would continue renovating various spaces, upgrade and expand the rooftop amenities, and build a new fitness center and conference center.
