<text>Zingst (; Polabian &quot;Sgoni&quot;) is the easternmost portion of the three-part Fischland-Darß-Zingst Peninsula, located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, between the cities of Rostock and Stralsund on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea.

The area is part of the Pomeranian coast. The Zingst Peninsula forms an eastward-running spit, nearly in length, and has a width of just .

Zingst separates the Baltic Sea from the lagoon of Barther Bodden, which is part of the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain, a large estuary. The shallow waters of the inlet are a major stopover for the migratory European crane. In spring and autumn, up to 3,000 birds gather here on their migration route to and from Spain. Most of the estuary and the eastern end of the peninsula are part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park.

Until the early 1870s, Zingst was an island, separated from Darß by the Prerowstrom, a narrow inlet. A storm tide in 1874 closed the inlet, which had connected the &quot;bodden&quot; with the Baltic Sea. A road now connects Zingst and Darß, running along a -wide isthmus.

The soils of Zingst consist almost entirely of sand. The sand is white in colour, which makes it popular with sunbathers and tourists. Dunes border the Baltic Sea and enclose low ground about half a metre below sea level. The low-lying land results in boggy conditions in the interior of the peninsula, and these bogs offer habitat to a wide variety of wildlife. The ruins of a Slavic fort, the &#x27;Hertesburg,&#x27; are on the Zingst peninsula near Zingst municipality.

== Geology, climate and natural region ==
The peninsula of Zingst or &quot;the Zingst&quot; is the easternmost part of the Fischland-Darß-Zingst peninsula that lies between the city of Rostock and town of Stralsund on the southern Baltic Sea coast. With a length of just under 20 km and a width of the Zingst stretches eastwards from the adjacent peninsula of Darß. It is bounded to the north by the Baltic and to the south by the lagoons of Barther Bodden und Grabow, that belong to the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. The island of Großer Werder, which once lay off the eastern coast of Zingst, has now become attached as a peninsula as a result of sanding up.

The land bridge to Darß to the west is only about wide and right on the Baltic Sea. At this spot in 1874 the inlet of Prerower Strom, which had hitherto lined the lagoon and the Baltic, was artificially closed following the 1872 Baltic Sea flood. Only since that time has Zingst no longer been an island.

The settlement heart of the village of Zingst lies between the &quot;Freesenbruch&quot; in the west, the Baltic in the north, the &quot;Alte Straminke,&quot; an old sea inlet with its surrounding marshes, in the east, and the channel of Zingster Strom in the south. The village is barely above sea level, so that it has to be protected from storm floods by dykes. Further east, on the Zingster Strom, is the village of Müggenburg.

East of the village of Zingst lies a large forest, very rich in wildlife, called the Osterwald. Beyond that are the Sund Meadows (&quot;Sundischen Wiesen&quot;) named after Stralsund. The easternmost point of the peninsula is Pramort.

=== Geology ===
The original island of Zingst is, geologically, a very young landscape. Its formation process began with the end of Weichselian glaciation, about 12,000 years ago. This left behind a Young Drift landscape. As a result of the melting ice sheet, the underlying land lifted and the hollows were filled with water and the predecessor to the Baltic Sea, Lake Ancylus, was created. The tops of the ridges remained exposed as islands. The major outline of the coasts in the southern area of the Baltic Sea were formed by the Littorina transgression, about 7,000 to 2,500 years ago. About 5,000 years ago, the sea reached its present level and the cores of today&#x27;s Darß and Zingst became islands. 4,500 years ago, the salt water inflow from the North Sea reduced greatly and, since then, the Baltic Sea has slowly become less salty. Coastal erosion (abrasion, dispersal and deposition) has extended the original islands in the course of time to their present form. About 1,500 years ago, the ever-lengthening spits cut off the bays lying behind them, forming a string of lagoons known as the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. Finally, in 1874, the Prerower Strom channel between the Darß and Zingst was artificially closed. Towards the end of the 20th century the former island of Great Werder became connected to the Zingst as the strait between them silted up. This area is a windwatt. The process of land formation continues at the eastern end of the peninsula today. Zingst lies between the accretion zones of &quot;Darßer Ort&quot; and &quot;Bock. Sediment is transported in a west-to-east direction, and the beach at Zingst loses 40 cm annually. The loss was mainly caused by storm surges, so this process is now severely weakened.

=== Climate ===

Zingst exhibits a North Mecklenburg coastal climate. The annual average temperature is . The number of frosty days is 11.1 and the number of hot summer days (temperatures over ) is 7.9. Precipitation is a relatively low per year. The average humidity is very high as a result of its coastal location. As a result the number of dull days is 146.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The Osterwald forest is the only raised bog in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, but it has been partially dried out as a result of human intervention. The tree species here include birch, English oak, beech and pine. Other trees introduced by humans include alder, spruce and firs. A feature is the redwoods, planted in 1955. Amongst the animal population are tawny owl, red kite and short-eared owl. Pine martens are also common.
==Settlement==

East of the Prerowstrom, surrounded by countryside and the Freesenbruch, is the town of Barth (population 8,000), which was created by the unification of the settlements of Pahlen, Hanshagen and Rothem ho. Hanshagen and Pahlen date to the 13th century.

The nearby town of Zingst has a population of about 3,200.

== Notable people ==
* Bernhard Tessmann (1912–1998), expert in guided missiles during WWII, later worked for NASA.
* Werner Kuhn (born 1955), politician; Member of the European Parliament (MEP), 2009/2019.

==Rocket experiments==

At the former National People&#x27;s Army training area in the Sundisch meadows from 1970-1992 various experiments were conducted using high-altitude research rockets.

In the early 1970s, five Polish Meteor 1E sounding rockets were launched from here. From 21 October 1988, Soviet MMR06-M rockets were launched. Even after the Wende, trials continued. Between 14 February 1992 and 10 April 1992, 19 Russian MMR06-M rockets were fired from Zingst. Although further rockets were available, the launch of MMR06-M rockets on Zingst had to be stopped in April 1992 because the army needed to clear the site to make the out of bounds area safe.

<text>The Woman&#x27;s Exponent was a semi-official publication of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that began in 1872. It published articles advocating for women&#x27;s suffrage and plural marriage, in addition to poetry and other writings. Lula Greene Richards and Emmeline B. Wells were its editors until 1914, when the &quot;Exponent&quot; was dissolved. It was &quot;the first long-lived feminist periodical in the western United States.&quot; While it had no direct successor, the Relief Society did launch its own magazine, the &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot;, in 1915.

A new publication, independent of the church but partially inspired by the earlier magazine, was launched by a women&#x27;s group in Massachusetts in 1974, entitled &quot;Exponent II&quot;, and continues to the present day, along with a program of annual retreats, and latterly a semi-autonomous blog site, &quot;The Exponent&quot;.

==Goals and approach==
The &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; (&quot;A Utah Ladies&#x27; Journal&quot;) was a periodical published from 1872 until 1914 in Salt Lake City with the stated aims of defending and inculcating right principles, and sharing useful knowledge, and to &quot;discuss every subject interesting and valuable to women.&quot; Its goals have been summarized by later commentators as uplifting and strengthening women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and educating those not of the faith about the women of the Church. The prospectus of &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; cited grievances with the portrayal of Utah women in the press as a reason for the paper&#x27;s creation, asserting: &quot;Who are so well able to speak for the women of Utah as the women of Utah themselves? &#x27;It is better to represent ourselves than to be misrepresented by others!

Though not an official LDS Church publication, the &quot;Exponent&quot; was owned, operated and edited by LDS Church members in a private capacity. The periodical was closely tied to the Church&#x27;s women&#x27;s organizations, the Female Relief Societies, unified as the Relief Society. It was approved by the General Authorities of the Church, and often published news of Church events and essays relating to doctrine, but was editorially independent.

Throughout the time of its publication, the newspaper, as it was generally described, covered many topics and featured conflicting points of view. It was a strong voice in support of woman&#x27;s suffrage. It also actively supported plural marriage, which was a religious practice of the Church at the time. Home, family, and the overall role of women were also frequent topics. The &quot;Exponent&quot; both expressed that the &quot;woman&#x27;s sphere&quot; in the home was a noble construct of society and encouraged women to expand beyond it; education for women was often urged to the audience. Lucinda Lee Dalton, an early Mormon feminist, was a frequent contributor. The &quot;Exponent&quot; also published excerpts from Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot; and passages on the Mormon doctrine of Heavenly Mother. In addition to these religious, social, and political topics, the &quot;Exponent&quot; included poems and stories, tidbits of humor or wisdom, and current news. Recipes and other housekeeping tips and notes on dress were also published. To promote a more financially-independent Utah, the &quot;Exponent&quot; &quot;constantly exhorted women to consume only locally made products.&quot; Reports from meetings of Relief Society bodies and other auxiliary organizations, such as young women’s and primary groups, were often included. Though it was a private publication, women of the Relief Society were actively encouraged to subscribe, as well as contribute to the paper.

==Format and circulation==
The newspaper was generally issued semi-monthly at first and later monthly, on quarto paper in three columns. Each edition was eight pages long. &quot;The Exponent&quot; was described as &quot;well filled with reading matter.&quot; Its circulation was estimated by the &quot;Pacific States Newspaper Directory&quot; to be 4,000 in 1888, and its readership likely exceeded that number; the &quot;Exponent&quot; was used in women&#x27;s meetings and exchanged with papers outside of Utah. It was credited with considerable influence in Utah, and was quoted in other journals. The back page of the newspaper was reserved for advertisements, which included ads from the President of the Church encouraging women to open their own bank accounts. Other ads were for clothing, silkworms, and classes in midwifery.

==History==
The editor of the &quot;Salt Lake Herald&quot;, Edward L. Sloan, originally intended to create a woman&#x27;s column in the &quot;Herald&quot; itself. When the staff refused to support his idea, and having heard of the idea of a journal for women circulating in the Relief Society, Sloan decided to start the &quot;Exponent&quot; as a separate publication. He recruited Louisa Lula Greene as editor, and she accepted the position after she secured the approval of her great uncle, Brigham Young, the president of the LDS Church, who assigned it to her as a mission. Greene moved to Salt Lake City in April 1872, and originally worked from a room in the house of another great uncle, but later moved to a purpose-built office with living quarters. The first issue was published on June 1, 1872.
Emmeline B. Wells, who would later become general president of the Relief Society, joined Greene as co-editor in the 1 December 1875 issue. They are both listed as editors on page 100 of vol. 4 no. 13; The two worked together to edit the magazine until Greene decided to take some time for her family in July 1877. She is last listed as editor on page 28 of vol. 6 no. 4; Wells was later joined by her daughter, Annie Wells Cannon, as associate editor, in June 1905. Her name first appears on page 4 of vol. 34 no. 1. Both continued to serve as the publication&#x27;s editors until it folded.

The periodical faced increasing financial pressures from the late 1800s or early 1900s, and Wells unsuccessfully lobbied the Relief Society General Board to adopt the newspaper as its official publication. The paper was forced to close in February 1914. That month, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; recorded that the &quot;Exponent&quot; was &quot;to give way to what is hoped to be a larger and more modern [publication], but as yet nothing has been done.&quot; The &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot;, a separate magazine and an official publication of the LDS Church, began in January 1915.

==&quot;Exponent II&quot;==

Described by its production team as a &quot;spiritual descendant&quot; of the Woman&#x27;s Exponent, a new independent publication, &quot;Exponent II&quot;, was launched by a women&#x27;s group in the Cambridge area of Massachusetts in 1974. A quarterly periodical, it is now the longest-running independent publication for Latter-day Saint women.

<text>The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly shortened to Ensign ( ), was an official periodical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1971 to 2020. The magazine was first issued in January 1971, along with the correlated &quot;New Era&quot; (for youth) and the &quot;Friend&quot; (for children). Each of these magazines replaced the older church publications &quot;The Improvement Era&quot;, &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Instructor&quot;, and the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. Unlike some of its predecessors, the &quot;Ensign&quot; contained no advertisements.

As an official church publication, the &quot;Ensign&quot; contained faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, sermons, and writings of church leaders.

For many years, the May and November editions of the &quot;Ensign&quot; provided reports of the proceedings of the church&#x27;s annual and semi-annual general conferences. These issues contain the full sermons and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the church&#x27;s general authorities and general officers.

The text of every issue of the magazine is available on the church&#x27;s web site. Each issue since January 2001 is also available in PDF format.

In April 2018, the magazine discontinued its First Presidency message, an article traditionally found at the front of the magazine written by a member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency. This message was traditionally used by home teachers for a lesson as they visited their assigned families. This change coincided with the church&#x27;s revamping of the home teaching program into ministering.

In August 2020, the LDS Church announced that the &quot;Ensign&quot; would cease publication at the end of 2020 and would be replaced by the English-language version of &quot;Liahona&quot;. The final issue was dated December 2020.

<doc id="625476" wikidata="Q2517093" url="?curid=625476" title="Child Ballads">
<text>The Child Ballads are 305 traditional ballads from England and Scotland, and their American variants, anthologized by Francis James Child during the second half of the 19th century. Their lyrics and Child&#x27;s studies of them were published as The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. The tunes of most of the ballads were collected and published by Bertrand Harris Bronson in and around the 1960s.
==History==

===Age and source of the ballads===

The ballads vary in age; for instance, the manuscript of &quot;Judas&quot; dates to the thirteenth century and a version of &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; was printed in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The majority of the ballads, however, date to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Although some are claimed to have very ancient influences, only a handful can be definitively traced to before 1600. Moreover, few of the tunes collected are as old as the words. Nevertheless, Child&#x27;s collection was far more comprehensive than any previous collection of ballads in English.

Many of Child&#x27;s ballads were obtained from printed broadsides, but he generally distinguished the &quot;traditional&quot; ballads that interested him from later broadside ballads. As Child died before writing a commentary on his work, it is uncertain exactly how and why he selected some ballads and discounted others.

===Editorial history===

Child&#x27;s collection was not the first of its kind; there had been many less scholarly collections of English and Scottish ballads, particularly from Bishop Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; (1765) onwards. There were also &quot;comprehensive&quot; ballad collections from other countries. Child modelled his work on Svend Grundtvig&#x27;s &quot;Danmarks gamle Folkeviser&quot;, classifying and numbering the ballads and noting different versions, which were placed side by side to aid comparison. As a result, one Child number may cover several ballads, which Child considered variants of the same story, although they may differ in many ways (as in &quot;James Hatley&quot;). Conversely, ballads classified separately may contain turns of phrase, and even entire verses, that are identical.

The editorial history of Child&#x27;s publication received a monograph study by Mary Ellen Brown in 2011.

===Bibliographic history===

In 1860, Child published an eight-volume collection entitled &quot;English and Scottish Ballads&quot;, generally presenting just one variant of each ballad, via Little, Brown and Company. However, as a scholarly edition this was superseded by his later and similarly named &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;.

The first edition of Child&#x27;s book was, once complete, &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;, ed. by Francis James Child, 5 vols (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, [1882–98]).

It was printed in one thousand copies, and issued in ten parts, each with a half-title and title page. The final title pages for each of the five volumes, printed in red and black, were issued with part 10. Part 10 emerged after Child&#x27;s death, and was edited by George Lyman Kittredge. Volume 5 contained a variety of scholarly apparatuses: the &quot;Glossary&quot; (V, pp. [309]-396); &quot;Sources of the texts of the English and Scottish ballads&quot; (V, pp. [397]-404); &quot;Index of published airs of English and Scottish popular ballads, with an appendix of some airs from manuscript&quot; (V, pp. [405]-424); &quot;Index of ballad titles&quot; (V, pp. [425]-453); &quot;Titles of collections of ballads, or of books containing ballads&quot; (V, pp. [455]-468); and &quot;Index of matters and literature&quot; (V, pp. [469]-502).

The book was reprinted, this time physically in three volumes, in 1957 by the New York-based Folklore Press, in association with the Pageant Book Company. It was reprinted again in 1965 in New York by Dover, this time with an essay by Walter Morris Hart entitled &#x27;Professor Child and the Ballad&#x27; (reprinted from &quot;Publications of the Modern Language Association of America&quot;, vol. 21 [N.S. Vol. 14, no. 4]).

Child&#x27;s edition was also the basis for a number of shorter, popular editions, prominently including &quot;English and Scottish Popular Ballads Edited from the Collection of Francis James Child&quot;, ed. by Helen Child Sargent and George Lyman Kittredge (Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1904).0

Corrected edition of &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads,&quot; five volumes (Northfield, Minnesota: Loomis House Press, 2002-2011). Not counting reissues of the 1882-98 publication, this is its second edition. It incorporates, where they apply, the additional lyrics, additional commentary, corrections and music scores that Child included in appendixes in his subsequent volumes. It includes music scores (from sources that Child cited) for many ballads for which the 1882-1898 edition did not include one.

==Subjects of the ballads==

Child Ballads are generally heavier and darker than is usual for ballads. Some of the topics and other features characteristic enough of Child Ballads to be considered Child Ballad motifs are these: romance, enchantment, devotion, determination, obsession, jealousy, forbidden love, insanity, hallucination, uncertainty of one&#x27;s sanity, the ease with which the truth can be suppressed temporarily, supernatural experiences, supernatural deeds, half-human creatures, teenagers, family strife, the boldness of outlaws, abuse of authority, betting, lust, death, karma, punishment, sin, morality, vanity, folly, dignity, nobility, honor, loyalty, dishonor, riddles, historical events, omens, fate, trust, shock, deception, disguise, treachery, disappointment, revenge, violence, murder, cruelty, combat, courage, escape, exile, rescue, forgiveness, being tested, human weaknesses, and folk heroes.

On one extreme, some Child Ballads recount identifiable historical people, in known events, embellished for dramatic effect. On the other, some differ from fairy tales solely by their being songs and in verse; some have been recast in prose form as fairy tales. A large part of the collection is about Robin Hood; some are about King Arthur. A few of the ballads are rather bawdy.

==Modern recordings==
Many Child Ballads have subsequently appeared in contemporary music recordings. Burl Ives&#x27;s 1949 album, &quot;The Return of the Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, for example, includes two: &quot;Lord Randall&quot; and &quot;The Divil and the Farmer&quot;.

In 1956 four albums (consisting of eight LPs) of 72 Child Ballads sung by Ewan MacColl and A.L. Lloyd were released: &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, Vols. 1–4&quot;.

In 1960 John Jacob Niles published &quot;The Ballad Book of John Jacob Niles&quot;, in which he connects folk songs which he collected throughout the southern United States and Appalachia in the early 20th century to the Child Ballads. Many of the songs he published were revived in the Folk music revival, for example &quot;The Riddle Song&quot; (&quot;I gave my love a Cherry&quot;), which he connects with Child No. 1, &quot;Riddles Wisely Expounded&quot;.

Joan Baez sang ten Child ballads distributed among her first five albums, the liner notes of which identified them as such.

Loreena McKennitt performs Child ballad 170 &quot;The Death of Queen Jane&quot; on her album &quot;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&quot; recorded in 2010, and Child ballad 239 &quot;Annachie Gordon&quot; on her album &quot;Parallel Dreams&quot; in 1989.

British folk rock groups such as Fairport Convention, Pentangle and Steeleye Span drew heavily on the Child Ballads in their repertoires, and many other recording artists have recorded individual ballads. Harry Smith included a number of them into his &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;.

A rendition of child ballad 155 (&quot;Fatal Flower Garden&quot;) appears on Andrew Bird&#x27;s The Swimming Hour.

In 2003 English folk singer June Tabor recorded the album An Echo of Hooves consisting entirely of Child ballads (210, 212, 161, 195, 191, 106, 74, 215, 88, 20, 58).

Child ballad 95, The Maid Freed from the Gallows has appeared in several recordings of blues and rock bands, notably by Lead Belly as &quot;Gallis Pole&quot; and on the album Led Zeppelin III under the name &quot;Gallows Pole.&quot;

Child ballads also occasionally occur in the work of musical groups not usually associated with folk material, such as Ween&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; (Child 78) under the title &quot;Cold Blows the Wind&quot; and versions of &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; (Child 84) recorded by the Everly Brothers, Art Garfunkel, and (on the soundtrack of the 2004 film &quot;A Love Song for Bobby Long&quot;) John Travolta. In 2009, Fleet Foxes included &quot;The Fause Knight Upon the Road&quot; as the b-side to the 7&quot; release of &quot;Mykonos&quot; (as &quot;False Knight on the Road&quot;). In 2013 US singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell and Jefferson Hamer released &quot;Child Ballads&quot; comprising seven songs from the Francis James Child collection and in 2014 American folksinger Martyn Wylde released eight of the Ballads on his album The Child Ballads, Volume 1.

Child Ballads are also referenced heavily in James A. Michener&#x27;s novel &quot;The Drifters&quot;.

Virginia Woolf references Child Ballad number 173 &quot;Mary Hamilton&quot; in &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;.

==Print and electronic editions of Child&#x27;s two collections==
The two collections have about 200 ballads in common. Each of the two collections includes about a hundred ballads that the other does not.

<text>Gilbert Jeremy Gottfried (February 28, 1955 – April 12, 2022) was an American stand-up comedian and actor, best known for his exaggerated shrill voice, strong New York accent, his squint, and his edgy, often controversial, sense of humor. His numerous roles in film and television included voicing Iago in The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; franchise until his death in 2022, Mister Mxyzptlk in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, Digit LeBoid in PBS Kids&#x27; &quot;Cyberchase&quot; until his death in 2022, Kraang Subprime in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and the Aflac duck (before he was replaced by Daniel McKeague in 2011). He also played Mr. Peabody in the &quot;Problem Child&quot; franchise, the only actor in the series to reprise his role in both all three films and in the animated television series.

Gottfried hosted &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot; (2014–2022), along with Frank Santopadre, which featured discussions of classic films and celebrity interviews, most often with veteran actors, comedians, musicians, and comedy writers. The documentary &quot;Gilbert&quot; (2017) explored his life and career.

==Early life==
Gottfried was born in the Coney Island section of the Brooklyn borough of New York City on February 28, 1955, the son of hardware store owner Max Gottfried and homemaker Lillian Zimmerman. His father and grandfather ran the store, above which the family lived. He was raised in a Jewish family, but later said of his unusual upbringing, &quot;I ate pork. We weren&#x27;t that aware of the holidays or anything like that, but were aware of being Jewish. It&#x27;s like I kind of knew that even though I was never bar mitzvahed and we didn&#x27;t follow the holidays, I knew that if the Nazis came back, I&#x27;d be in the same train coach with everyone else.&quot;
He was the younger brother of Karen Gottfried and photographer Arlene Gottfried (1950–2017).

From Coney Island, the family moved to Brooklyn&#x27;s Crown Heights, followed by Borough Park.

==Career==
Gottfried&#x27;s first comedy routine on stage was at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village during one of its Hootenanny Night events when he was 15 years old. His two sisters Arlene and Karen accompanied him, having thought the performances he did for the family were good enough for the stage and encouraged him to try it out. His early routines focused on impressions of old time actors and celebrities, including Boris Karloff and Humphrey Bogart. From there, he worked the local comedy circuit and became known in the area as a &quot;comedian&#x27;s comedian&quot;, and started to perform edgier material when he became bored with his usual routines. One such incident occurred when Gottfried opened for Belinda Carlisle, which was attended by younger girls and their mothers. Gottfried stated: &quot;I tried doing my regular act for about 5 minutes, then I just launched into the filthiest stuff I could think of. And the next day, I got a call from my agent saying, &#x27;Everybody there loved you,&#x27; which is show business talk for, &#x27;You&#x27;re fired.

In 1980, when &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians, the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member for its sixth season. Gottfried&#x27;s persona during &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches was different from his later characterization: He rarely spoke in his trademark voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was rarely used in sketches. Gottfried recalled that a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral, saying that he hated the writers and the writers hated him. He played one recurring character named Leo Waxman (husband of Denny Dillon&#x27;s Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch &quot;What&#x27;s It All About?&quot;) and did two celebrity impersonations: David Stockman and Roman Polanski.

From 1983 to 1984, Gottfried regularly performed on Alan Thicke&#x27;s short-lived show &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;. In April 1987, he headlined a half-hour comedy special that aired as part of the &quot;Cinemax Comedy Experiment&quot; series. Gottfried played Sidney Bernstein in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, in which he reunited with friend and fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Eddie Murphy. In August that same year, Gottfried made his debut appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. He went on to make over 100 appearances on the radio show over the next 25 years. That year, he also starred in the sitcom pilot &quot;Norman&#x27;s Corner&quot;, co-written by Larry David prior to creating &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.
Although not a regular, Gottfried appeared in &quot;The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys&quot;, as well as performed the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf in &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;. Three of his most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as Igor Peabody in &quot;Problem Child&quot; and &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; and Iago in &quot;Aladdin&quot;. When asked how he prepared for the role of Iago, Gottfried joked, &quot;I did the whole DeNiro thing. I moved to South America! I lived in the trees!&quot; Gottfried reprised the role in &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, the television series and various related media, such as &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. However, the character was ultimately recast to Alan Tudyk for the 2019 remake. Gottfried also voiced Berkeley Beetle in the 1994 film &quot;Thumbelina&quot;. He was the host of the Saturday edition of &quot;USA Up All Night&quot; for its entire run from 1989 to 1998.

He was a recurring guest star during the Tom Bergeron era of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and became the center of attention in a bizarre episode that aired on October 1, 1999. In this episode, the two contestants made nine consecutive incorrect guesses, six of which were to be game-deciding questions asked to Gottfried. As the only remaining square left, whoever captured him would have five squares and therefore win the game. Penn Jillette, who was a guest alongside Teller on the same episode, berated a contestant earlier for giving an incorrect guess by shouting, &quot;You fool!&quot;. Gottfried himself began to use the phrase, with most of the other stars (including Bergeron himself) eventually joining in with every successive wrong guess, beginning with the second question he was asked. As a result, it took the episode&#x27;s entire half hour to play only one game. However, he was eventually captured on the last possible question. Appropriately, the episode became known as the &quot;You Fool!&quot; episode. Gottfried was temporarily fired from &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; after this incident, returning about a month later.

Gottfried provided the voice of the duck in the Aflac commercials, Digit in &quot;Cyberchase&quot;, Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, and Mister Mxyzptlk (pronounced &quot;Mikz-yez-pit-lik&quot;) in &quot;&quot;. He reprised his role as Mister Mxyzptlk in &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;, &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, and &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot;. He also played a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick Knack in two episodes of &quot;Superboy&quot;. He also co-wrote an issue of &quot;Superboy&quot;, which featured Nick Knack&#x27;s origin. Gottfried made regular appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and has played Harry Potter and Yoda.
In 2004, Comedy Central featured Gottfried&#x27;s stand-up material for &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;. Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for Microsoft&#x27;s Office XP software, showing (in a series of animated cartoons) that the Clippy office assistant would be removed. In 2006, Gottfried topped the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek list of the world&#x27;s 100 Unsexiest Men. In April, he performed with the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Mask and Wig Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; portion of &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; (as a baby in a large high chair, he says &quot;Hey Ricki, I think I need my diaper changed!&quot;), and in the Dodge Viper in the big deal (where he tells the contestants &quot;What were you thinking?!&quot; because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; as Santa Claus in the one-hour Christmas special. He voiced Rick Platypus in an episode of &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot; entitled &quot;That Darn Platypus&quot;.

He appeared as Peter&#x27;s horse in an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; entitled &quot;Boys Do Cry&quot;, in which Peter is excited to learn that Gottfried is providing the voice of the horse. He also voiced himself in some episodes. He also guest-starred in &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with David Faustino for an episode of Faustino&#x27;s show &quot;Star-ving&quot;. In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode &quot;Lost Traveller&quot; on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the NYPD&#x27;s Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer Warren Leight said could become a recurring character. Gottfried read a section from the hit book &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created with the aim of using his trademark voice to make fun of the book&#x27;s graphic sexual content.

In 2011, Gottfried published his only book &quot;Rubber Balls and Liquor&quot;.

In 2013, he became a member of &quot;Team Rachael&quot; in the second season of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. In March that year, he appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, in which he swapped wives with Alan Thicke. He was also a commentator on &quot;truTV Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot;.
On May 28, 2014, Sideshow Network premiered &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot;, an interview podcast where Gottfried and his co-host Frank Santopadre discussed classic films and talk to &quot;Hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents&quot; who shaped Gottfried&#x27;s childhood and influenced his comedy. His first guest was Dick Cavett. His final guest was Brenda Vaccaro in a two part episode released on April 25 and May 2, 2022. Gottfried would be hospitalized a few hours after the episode&#x27;s recording. Since Gottfried&#x27;s death, the podcast continued by re-uploading older episodes in honor of his legacy.

Gottfried was the third contestant fired during the fourteenth season of the NBC reality show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. In 2016, he played the &quot;Pig Man&quot; in a comedy / fantasy film titled &quot;Abnormal Attraction&quot;. In 2017, he appeared as himself in &quot;Episodes&quot;, where a contestant on a fictional TV endurance game show is penalized with &quot;48 hours of Gilbert Gottfried&quot;.

On June 10, 2018, Gottfried appeared in a special segment of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; where, for UK viewers only, a segment about the UK&#x27;s law restricting broadcast of debates from the Houses of Parliament was replaced by 5 minutes of him reading &quot;3-star Yelp reviews&quot; along with host John Oliver telling the audience &quot;you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law.&quot; He returned on November 18, 2018, in the show&#x27;s last episode of the year to read out extracts from the Brexit agreement, again for UK viewers only. He had previously performed as &quot;the real voice of Jared Kushner&quot; in dubbed film clips on the show.

On July 31, 2019, Gottfried appeared as a guest in episode 170 of the &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;.

On January 10, 2022, he guest-starred as God in the penultimate episode of &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; Season 1. On October 18, 2022, he appeared in the &quot;Somebody Feed Phil&quot; Season 6 episode &quot;Croatia&quot; in the &quot;Joke for Max&quot; segment on a video call with the show host Philip Rosenthal where he tells a few jokes in honor of Phil&#x27;s late father Max. Released in the same month, &quot;The Paloni Show! Halloween Special&quot; includes a skit with Gottfried voicing an &quot;apartment manager who doesn&#x27;t want to deal with his tenants.&quot;

In April 2023, he had a posthumous guest role on the second episode of Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Royal Crackers&quot; as a &quot;fixer&quot; hired to dispose of a dead body. The episode ended with a dedicated message to Gottfried saying &quot;Thank you, Gilbert&quot; before the credits.

===Podcast===
&quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot; launched on June 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;vulture/2016/05/gottfried-podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;GGACP&quot; was a long-form interview podcast&lt;ref name=&quot;vulture/2016/08/school-of-gottfried&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was hosted by not only Gottfried, but his friend and professional comedy writer Frank Santopadre. Gottfried&#x27;s wife Dara served as executive producer and it was recorded weekly until his death in 2022, with re-uploads of older episodes continuing afterwards in his honor.

Standard episodes ran about an hour in length and featured interviews with a variety of entertainers, writers, and directors, including Dick Cavett, Tippi Hedren, George Takei, Brenda Vaccaro (who ended up being his final guest), Bob Costas, Susie Essman, Dick Van Dyke, Alan Arkin, Phil Rosenthal, Lee Grant, and many more. Several guests made more than one appearance, but none more often than Mario Cantone. Cantone would annually help Gottfried and Santopadre celebrate the Christmas season with a mixture of songs, jokes, and cheer.

Its title &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot; is a reference to the 1957 black-and-white science fiction film &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot;, directed by Bert I. Gordon. Gottfried&#x27;s chaotic comedic riffing and Santopadre&#x27;s earnest interviewing offered the show a style all its own.

Starting in 2015, the podcast featured shorter mini-episodes around half an hour in length on more specific topics like particular character actors, films, or songs. The mini-episodes were later rebranded as Amazing Colossal Obsessions.

===Artistry and image===
Danny Gallagher of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;Gottfried has one of the most original formulas in the history of comedy,&quot; adding, &quot;You don&#x27;t just laugh at the punchline when Gilbert Gottfried tells a joke. You laugh at the setup. You laugh at his comments about the joke. You even laugh at the segues between his jokes.&quot; Eric Falwell wrote of his influence in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;: &quot;Gottfried&#x27;s work as a stand-up shaped many comics today, whether they would say as much or not. He was a figure who ... pushed stand-up to move beyond the realm of the merely observational and create space for the absurd.&quot; In 2022, the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; named him one of &quot;The Top 10 Jewish Reality TV Stars of All Time.&quot;

Gottfried was best known for speaking in an exaggerated loud and grating voice, which was not his natural speaking voice. Mark Binneli of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Gottfried as a &quot;squinting, squawking mass of contradictions&quot;, noting his status as &quot;one of America&#x27;s filthiest stand-ups&quot; while simultaneously being &quot;one of the most successful voice-over artists in children&#x27;s entertainment&quot;. He was also known for joking about recent tragedies, prompting fellow comedian Bill Maher to dub him the &quot;King of Too Soon&quot;. In a July 2012 op-ed for CNN, he wrote, &quot;I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it&#x27;s crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it&#x27;s laughing. Nowadays, we would say, &#x27;How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask.&#x27;&quot;

===Controversies===
At the 43rd Primetime Emmy Awards, Gottfried told a series of masturbation jokes in reference to Paul Reubens&#x27; arrest for masturbating in an adult theater, saying if it was a crime, he [Gottfried] should be on death row. Viewers in the Eastern time zone saw the entire set live, but Fox censored the broadcast for the West Coast delay. Fox issued an apology, calling the jokes &quot;irresponsible and insulting&quot;. Gottfried said that producers stated he would not be invited back and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the monologue resulted in his blacklisting.

During his monologue at a Friars Club roast of Hugh Hefner, 3 weeks after the September 11 attacks, Gottfried joked that he had intended to catch a plane, but could not get a direct flight because &quot;they said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first&quot;. This was one of the first public examples of 9/11 humor. Audience members responded with hisses and a cry of &quot;too soon!&quot;. Gottfried later stated he thought &quot;too soon&quot; meant he did not take a long enough pause before the punchline. Realizing he had lost the audience &quot;bigger than anybody has ever lost an audience&quot;, Gottfried abandoned his prepared remarks and launched into the famous Aristocrats joke, which won back the audience. Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza used Gottfried&#x27;s monologue as a segment in their 2005 film &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;.

On March 14, 2011, Gottfried tweeted 12 jokes about the earthquake disaster in Japan. Aflac, which does 75% of its business in Japan, responded by dismissing Gottfried from voicing its mascot and announcing a casting call for his replacement, despite Gottfried later apologizing for his jokes. He was replaced by Daniel McKeague (who did an impression of Gottfried) on April 26.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Gottfried suffered from appendicitis and was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The treatment was successful.

In the late 1990s, he met Dara Kravitz at a Grammy Awards party. They married in 2007 and had two children. He was a longtime resident of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

Gottfried was known for his frugality. He often walked instead of using public transportation because he did not want to pay the fares. In another incident, illustrator Drew Friedman recalled that Gottfried would visit his apartment unannounced in the late 1980s to watch films on his VCR because he did not want to buy one of his own.

==Death==
On April 12, 2022, at 2:35 p.m. ET, Gottfried died at a Manhattan hospital of recurrent ventricular tachycardia, complicated by type II myotonic dystrophy, which he had privately suffered with for many years. He was 67 years old.

His family released a statement on his Twitter account, writing: &quot;We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our beloved Gilbert Gottfried after a long illness. In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children. Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert&#x27;s honor.&quot;

A funeral was held for Gottfried on April 14 in Westchester County, New York. Celebrities who attended the funeral were Jeff Ross (who delivered Gottfried&#x27;s eulogy), Colin Quinn, Susie Essman, Mario Cantone, Dave Attell, and Paul Shaffer, as well as Bob Saget&#x27;s wife Kelly Rizzo and their three daughters. Whoopi Goldberg, though not in attendance for the funeral, sent a gift in honor of Gottfried. Sarah Silverman had planned on sitting shiva with a slew of Gottfried&#x27;s friends and family.

He was buried in the Sharon Gardens section of Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, with the epitaph on his gravestone reading, &quot;Too Soon&quot;, a reference to his Friar&#x27;s Club controversy, as well as his death.

==Legacy==
Gottfried was scheduled to appear as a special guest at the Ebertfest film festival to discuss &quot;Gilbert&quot;, the documentary film about him. Ebertfest announced it would dedicate its 2022 event to Gottfried and Sidney Poitier. Gottfried was also posthumously inducted into the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards&#x27; Monster Kid Hall of Fame.

The 2023 video game &quot;Justice League: Cosmic Chaos&quot; is dedicated to Gottfried&#x27;s memory as he was to reprise his role as Mister Mxyzptlk; Dana Snyder recorded the part in his place. In the same year, Ron Pardo took over Gottfried&#x27;s voice role as Digit in &quot;Cyberchase&quot;; the role of Iago was taken over by Barrett Leddy in &quot;Lego Disney Princess: The Castle Quest&quot; (and went on to voice Iago more often) and by Piotr Michael in &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match&quot; is dedicated to Gottfried, where he voiced David Doubdly in a posthumous credit.

<text>Thomas Rymer (c. 1643 – 14 December 1713) was an English poet, literary critic, antiquary and historiographer. 

His lasting contribution was to compile and publish under royal warrant the 17 volumes (the last two posthumously) of the first edition of &quot;Foedera&quot;, a work conveying treaties between The Crown of England and foreign powers from 1101 to 1625.

Rymer held the office of English Historiographer Royal from 1692 until his death in 1713, which allowed him access to the historical documents published in &quot;Foedera&quot; and held in the Tower of London and elsewhere. 

He is credited with coining the phrase &quot;poetic justice&quot; in &quot;The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider&#x27;d&quot; (1678).

==Life==
===Early life and education===

Thomas Rymer was born at Appleton Wiske, near Northallerton in the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1643, or possibly at Yafforth. He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, lord of the manor of Brafferton in Yorkshire, said by Clarendon to possess a good estate. The son studied at Northallerton Grammar School, where he was a classmate of George Hickes. There he studied for eight years under Thomas Smelt, a noted Royalist. Aged 16, he went to study at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, matriculating on 29 April 1659.

Although Rymer was still at Cambridge in 1662 when he contributed Latin verses to a university volume to mark the marriage of Charles II and Catherine of Braganza, there is no record of his taking a degree. This may have been due to financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or to his father&#x27;s arrest on 13 October 1663 — he was executed the following year for involvement in the Farnley Wood Plot, an intended uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas&#x27;s elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas was not implicated. On 2 May 1666 he became a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn. He was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.

===Literary career===
From 1674 to 1693 Rymer published a variety of works. He wrote a play; made a number of English translations of Latin authors, especially the poetry of Ovid; contributed prefaces in Latin and English to editions of works by various authors, including Thomas Hobbes; wrote political tracts; and published literary criticism, notably against Shakespeare. These are all discussed in the § Literary works section below.

===Historiographer===
On the death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692, Rymer was appointed Historiographer Royal at a yearly salary of £200.

Under a royal warrant of 1693 and working with original documents dating back to the 12th century, many held in the Tower of London, for the rest of his life he collated and published ( &#x27;pacts&#x27; or &#x27;alliances&#x27;), a collection of treaties made between the English Crown and foreign European powers. The publication history of its 17 volumes (1704–1717) is somewhat involved, complicated by Rymer&#x27;s death in 1713. See &quot;§ Foedera&quot; below.

===Death===
Rymer died on 14 December 1713 and was buried four days later in St Clement Danes&#x27; Church in the Strand in London. He appears not to have left any immediate family.

==Works==
===Literary works===
Rymer&#x27;s first appearance in print was as translator of René Rapin&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on Aristotle&#x27;s Treatise of Poesie&quot; (1674), to which he added a preface in defence of the classic rules for unity in drama. Following the principles set there, he composed a verse tragedy licensed on 13 September 1677, called &quot;Edgar, or the English Monarch&quot;, which failed. It was printed in 1678, with a second edition in 1693. Rymer&#x27;s views on drama were again given to the world in a printed letter to Fleetwood Shepheard, a friend of Matthew Prior, entitled &quot;The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider&#x27;d&quot; (1678). Here, in discussing &quot;Rollo Duke of Normandy&quot; by John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman, Rymer coined the term &quot;poetical justice&quot;.

To Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Epistles Translated by Several Hands&quot; (1680), prefaced by Dryden, Rymer contributed &quot;Penelope to Ulysses&quot;. He was also one of those who Englished the so-called &quot;Dryden&#x27;s Plutarch&quot; of 1683–1686 (5 vols.): the life of Nicias fell to his share. Rymer wrote a preface to Whitelocke&#x27;s &quot;Memorials of English Affairs&quot; (1682), and in 1681 &quot;A General Draught and Prospect of the Government of Europe&quot;, reprinted in 1689 and 1714 as &quot;Of the Antiquity, Power, and Decay of Parliaments&quot;, where ignorant of a future dignity that would be his, he had the misfortune to observe, &quot;You are not to expect truth from an historiographer royal.&quot;
Rymer contributed three pieces to the collection of &quot;Poems to the Memory of Edmund Waller&quot; (1688) (afterwards reprinted in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Miscellany Poems&quot;), and wrote the Latin inscription on all four sides of Edmund Waller&#x27;s monument in Beaconsfield churchyard.

The preface (&quot;Lectori salutem&quot;) to the posthumous &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (1688) of Thomas Hobbes seems to have been written by Rymer. An English translation appeared in 1722. The &quot;Life of Hobbes&quot; (1681), sometimes ascribed to him, was written by Richard Blackburne. He produced a congratulatory poem on the arrival of Queen Mary in Westminster with William III on 12 February 1689.

Rymer&#x27;s next piece of authorship was to translate the sixth elegy of the third book of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Tristia&quot; for Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Miscellanies&quot;. The only version to contain Rymer&#x27;s rendering seems to be the second edition of the second part of the &quot;Miscellanies&quot;, subtitled &quot;Silvae&quot; (1692).

Shortly after Rymer&#x27;s appintment as Historiographer Royal in 1692, there appeared his much-discussed &quot;A Short View of Tragedy&quot; (1693), criticising Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which gave rise to &quot;The Impartial Critick&quot; (1693) of John Dennis, the epigram of Dryden.

===&quot;Foedera&quot;===
====First edition====
Rymer&#x27;s lasting contribution to scholarship was the (abbr. ), a collection of &quot;all the leagues, treaties, alliances, capitulations, and confederacies, which have at any time been made between the Crown of England and any other kingdoms, princes and states.&quot; Begun under a royal warrant in 1693, it was &quot;an immense labour of research and transcription on which he spent the last twenty years of his life&quot;. Documents were presented in their original Latin. Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy&#x27;s later &quot;Syllabus&quot; (1869-1885) provided summaries in English, despite the multiple incorrect assertions of certain websites. 

During his last two decades Rymer prepared for the press the text of vols. 1 through 15, most of vol. 16, and some of vol. 17, but only lived to see the publication of vols. 1 though 15, with printing of the latter, according to Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, &quot;finished on the 25th of August 1713, about four months before the death of Rymer&quot; These fifteen volumes of the 1st edition which Rymer saw to publication covered the period from May 1101 (Henry I) up to July 1586, half-way through the reign of Elizabeth I. He was assisted by Robert Sanderson, who completed and published by 1717 the material of Rymer&#x27;s two unfinished volumes covering the period up to 1625 (death of James I), including an index to the whole work of which it was written, &quot;nothing can well be more inconvenient&quot;. 

Sanderson, working on his own account (i.e. unsanctioned by a Royal warrant), published in the same format three further volumes (vols. 18–20, pub. 1731–1735) of lesser quality, dealing with domestic history rather than foreign affairs. Hardy does not consider them to be properly part of Rymer&#x27;s 1st edition. Hardy is highly critical of these last three volumes, saying that only about a quarter of the articles deserve to be there. Sanderson added some extraneous material which, according to Hardy, change the whole focus of the work: &quot;Instead of a &quot;Foedera&quot; he has rather produced a new work in the shape of materials for our domestic history, in which foreign affairs are slightly intermingled.&quot; &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of Edinburgh in 1834 described Sanderson&#x27;s contributions as &quot;the last three being supplementary.&quot;

====Later editions====

The following section contains a general outline of the complex and involved publication history of further editions of the &quot;Foedera&quot;.


George Holmes, clerk to Sir William Petyt, Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London revised the first 17 volumes in a 2nd edition (pub. 1727–1735), and also published a single folio in 1730 of corrections or &#x27;Amendations&#x27; to the first edition only.

Hardy states that Holmes was employed by the publisher of the first edition, Jacob Tonson, from p. 112 of Vol. 1, up to the end of Vol. 12 only; and that the subsequent third edition is essentially an edited reprint of the 17 vols. of the 2nd edition, plus Sanderson&#x27;s last 3 volumes unredacted.

A re-set and newly edited 3rd (&quot;Hague&quot;) edition (10 vols. in two-column format, pub. 1737–1745, including Sanderson&#x27;s &#x27;supplemental&#x27; volumes 18-20), was published and possibly edited by John Neaulme in The Hague, in &quot;ten closely-printed folio volumes&quot;. The first nine reprinted the 2nd edition by Holmes, with the tenth combining the French-language synopses () of Vols. 1–17 by Jean Le Clerc and Paul de Rapin, which had appeared soon after the English publication of each successive volume, with a new index to this edition of the &quot;Foedera&quot;. Rapin&#x27;s abridgements of Vols. II–XIX (but not I or XX) had been earlier translated into English in 1733.

The Record Commission in 1800 proposed a &quot;Supplement and Continuation&quot; to the &quot;Foedera&quot;; in 1809 it decided instead to make a complete revision, the 4th (&quot;Record&quot;) edition. Seven parts were prepared before the project was abandoned after the Commissioners became dissatisfied with the editing of Dr. Adam Clarke and others. Six parts in three volumes were published from 1816 to 1830 and the seventh in 1869, along with miscellaneous notes. &quot;Foedera&quot; was thus seemingly revised up to the year 1383, but this edition has attracted considerable criticism.

A three-volume English-language summary and index (&quot;Syllabus&quot;) to the 1st, 3rd and 4th editions of &quot;Foedera&quot; was published by Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy in 1869–1885. In the introduction to his second volume, Hardy was highly critical of Clarke who, although an industrious biblical and oriental scholar, was utterly unskilled in diplomacy or palaeography, and lacking any profound acquaintance with the English historical and antiquarian literature. Hardy prints a short list of 50 errors he randomly found in Clarke&#x27;s edition. He spends ten whole pages berating the editors of the Record edition for both what they included and what they omitted, especially for copying from printed sources and not consulting original MS, even though they were easily available and to hand. Hardy also blames Clarke for criticising Rymer and Holmes, although Clarke proceeded to commit the same sort of faults himself. The &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of July 1834 also notes that although Clarke was a distinguished orientalist himself, the sole entry in Arabic in the 4th edition has a mistake. 

Despite Hardy&#x27;s extensive condemnation of the editors and publications of the Record Commission, backed up by multiple examples of their errors, the Victoria County History recommends citing the Record Commission (RC) edition where available and the Hague edition otherwise.

All the editions thus suffer from various defects, and no complete and correct revision has been published as of 2024. Hardy had intended in his &quot;Syllabus&quot; to correct not only all the errors in Clarke, but in the whole of the first three editions as well: but this proved to be beyond him, faced with a vast array of material. Hardy&#x27;s work is probably the most reliable guide to the &quot;Foedera&quot;, but even confirming a single fact can involve checking multiple sources of the various editions of the &quot;Foedera&quot; and their indexes, along with Holmes&#x27;s &#x27;Emendations&#x27; and his own copy of the 1st edition, against Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Syllabus&quot; and its own index, and also his list of errata.

<doc id="625489" wikidata="Q646986" url="?curid=625489" title="Marin le Roy de Gomberville">
<text>Marin le Roy, sieur du Parc et de Gomberville (1600 – 14 June 1674) was a French poet and novelist.

He was born at Paris, and at fourteen he produced a volume of poetry. At twenty he wrote a &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;histoire&quot; and at twenty-two a pastoral, &quot;La Charité&quot;, which is really a novel. The characters, though disguised as shepherds and shepherdesses, represent real people for whose identification the author himself provides a key.

This was followed by a more ambitious work, &quot;Polexandre&quot; (5 vols. 1632–1637). The hero wanders through the world in search of the island home of the princess Alcidiane. It contains much history and geography; the travels of Polexandre extending to such unexpected places as Benin, the Canary Islands, Mexico and the Antilles, and incidentally we learn all that was then known of Mexican history.

&quot;Cythérée&quot; (4 vols.) appeared in 1630–1642, and in 1651 the &quot;Jeune Alcidiane&quot;, intended to undo any harm the earlier novels may have done, for Gomberville became a Jansenist and spent the last twenty-five years of his life in pious retirement. He was one of the earliest and most energetic members of the Académie française.

In 1646, Gomberville published the first edition of his emblem book, La Doctrine des Moeurs (&quot;The Doctrine of Morals&quot;) based on Otto van Veen&#x27;s &quot;Quinti Horatii Flacci Emblemata&quot; [1607]. Later editions appeared in 1681, 1682, 1683, 1684, 1685, and 1688 (all Paris). The illustrations in the first edition, mirror images of van Veen&#x27;s, were engraved by Pierre Daret.

<doc id="625492" wikidata="Q7681046" url="?curid=625492" title="Tambogrande">
<text>Tambogrande is a small town in the Piura Province of the Piura Region in northwestern Peru. One of many small towns chosen as a site for mining development during Peru&#x27;s mining boom in 1999, Tambogrande achieved prominence for successfully opposing the Manhattan Minerals mining development in the area. 

== Demographics ==
Compared with other regions, Tambogrande has some significant advantages, including access to water and its location near the port of Paita. The city&#x27;s main industry is the production of lemons and mangoes on the fertile land that surrounds the town, producing almost 40% of lemons in Peru and employing 65% of the population in its agricultural industry. 70,000 inhabitants occupy the region, and 16,000 inhabitants live in the town. Although there is no data that reports the poverty rate in Tambogrande, it is reported that in cities along the rural coastal area of Peru— such as Tambogrande—64% of inhabitants live on less than a dollar a day.

== History ==
In 1996, Manhattan Minerals, a Canadian mining company, bought the mineral rights below the town and had found a large copper and gold deposit, from which Manhattan Minerals sought to &quot;extract $1 billion USD worth of minerals&quot;. Upon this discovery, the Canadian mining company made a formal proposal to the Peruvian government, which would require the displacement of thousands and involve some harmful environmental risks to the town. The Peruvian government agreed to the proposal to mine the 10,000 hectares of land in Tambogrande for four years.

Despite the promise of jobs and improved infrastructure, the population balked at the proposal. The community did not want to see the town replaced with a kilometer-wide pit because they were concerned that the mining operation could generate enough pollution to destroy the region&#x27;s agriculture and limited water supply.

An unprecedented protest resulted, led by local leaders of the town and the local Roman Catholic Church as well as international NGOs. In 2002, in a referendum, organized by the NGOs, on the fate of the mining project—&quot;No&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot;—1.28% of the population voted in favor of it. The government would acknowledge the legitimacy of the project and called for Manhattan Minerals to end all operations.

=== Town Concerns ===
&quot;En Piura somos agricultores. (Con la minería) podríamos ver cómo todo sería destruido para siempre: el suelo, el agua, la cosecha.&quot; This farmer from Tambogrande says that in Piura, they are all farmers; with mining, it could bring great destruction to the soil, the ground, the water, and the harvest. He captures the residents’ sentiments toward the proposed mining project. Agriculture not only was their main source of revenue, but it also represented their way of life, their culture, and their identity as people of Tambogrande. A mining project would force them to leave in parts of the region, leaving a place they knew as a home for so many decades. 
Several mining projects in Peru such as Yanacocha, La Oroya, Cerro de Pasco and Huarmey have experienced immense environmental damage. There were some cases &quot;of heavy pollution and human intoxication due to accidentals or mismanagement of private or state mining enterprises.&quot; Residents are concerned that this could happen to Tambogrande and cause &quot;irreversible damage.&quot;

Piura Life and Agriculture and various NGOs partnered together to form some counterarguments against the Canadian mining company&#x27;s claims that it would cause little to no environmental damage. They stated that the mining project could cause deforestation because of the immense amount of water needed to mine, pollution that may affect the water supply, and nearby rivers, such as El Niño and Piura, that could be consummated. They also stated that farming production would suffer because of the environmental effects incurred. They deemed these environmental risks &quot;too high to be acceptable.&quot; Skeptical about the environmental study of the project the government would produce, Oxfam commissioned its own report and came to the same, aforementioned conclusions and described how the government&#x27;s methodology and approach was wrong. Concerns were also raised about the government&#x27;s neutrality in the course of dispute between Tambogrande and Manhattan Minerals, as the government owned 25% of Manhattan Minerals.

=== Manhattan Minerals push ===
&quot;Our company has a concrete proposal for development in Tambogrande. It&#x27;s a proposal with three concrete social and economic aspects that will resolve many of the problems affecting thousands of children and adults in Tambogrande,&quot; said Americo Villafuerte, the president of Manhattan Minerals, to the BBC in 2003 explaining how this mining project would improve the lives of the people in Tambogrande. This would be the &quot;narrative&quot; that the Canadian mining company pushed in the public dialogue. It commissioned a report that studied the impact of the mining project and the economic situation in Tambogrande, in an attempt to demonstrate to the public to support it. In its report, the company noted the low standard of living compared to others parts of Peru, the degradation of the soil, the median income and infant mortality rate, which all suggested there needed to be a change in Tambogrande. This change, as the report would point out, would be mining, which would dramatically change Tambogrande&#x27;s economy positively. The mining project would bring more foreign investment not just to this region, but to the country as a whole. Manhattan Minerals promised it would provide housing to the people who lose their houses and jobs so it would minimize any negative effects on the residents.

=== NGO involvement ===
Protesters formed the Tambogrande Defense Front (&quot;The Front&quot;) to garner more support among the people and to organize themselves and be unified in their direction and opposition against Manhattan Minerals. It was composed of local leaders of Tambogrande. The Front was limited, however, its outreach, organization, and resources as it was only composed of the farmers and residents. Though, with partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), their voices were amplified, and the NGOs each played their different roles in the organization. Some provided financial assistance and their contacts around the world, and others helped the community strategize their future steps as they oppose the mining project. They all strengthened this &quot;narrative&quot; that the mining project would only bring destruction to Tambogrande&#x27;s environment and identity and way of life. Some organizations that were a part of this coalition were OXFAM, Conacami, Piura Life and Agriculture, CREA Pueblo, the local Catholic Church, and some NGO environmental groups such as the Mineral Policy Center and Friends of the Earth from Costa Rica and Ecuador.

The National Confederation of Communities Affected by Mining of Peru (CONACAMI) organized &quot;up to million people&quot; in protesting the &quot;mining boom since the 1990s&quot; because these mining companies, they believed, would exploit the mining resources of &quot;Peruvian peasant communities&quot; and pose a great danger to their health and well-being for generations. In partnership with the community, CONACAMI launched a campaign &quot;under the slogan &#x27;without limes there is no ceviche. CONACAMI helped relay information back to farmers from the Front.

OXFAM, an organization dedicated to eradicating poverty, helped pushed the narrative further. It examined the governmental process that accompanied mining projects such as an environmental study. Before OXFAM joined, few were aware that such a study existed, and OXFAM noted some of the flaws associated with the study and commissioned its own to give its own analysis of the project which laid out the environmental risks and the conflicts that previous countries have had with mining. It shared this knowledge with residents and international organizations that would come forth and oppose the mining project. As one member said &quot;Sin las ONG habría sido difícil que [los tambograndinos] se opongan a él. No tenían ex- periencia, la mayor parte de ellos apenas alcanzó a acabar educación primaria.&quot; Without them, he says, it would have been much difficult for them to organize against a big corporation like Manhattan Mineral. Most of the members had a primary education, he says, which would only help them to a certain point. With their help, however, it enabled them to focus on their voices and spread their message and narrative. Because of the success in Tambogrande, the community&#x27;s success in preventing the mining project would inspire other waves of protests throughout Peru.

== Future of mining of Peru ==
Peru still remains a hot spot for mining developments, having one of the largest gold deposits in the world. Mining makes up 29% of all revenue in Peru, and the mining industry wields great power in Peru.

&quot;The Economist&quot; argues there is a path forward for sustainable development in Latin America and for mining corporations to work together with communities, and these corporations deserve more credit than critics give them. It notes that the poverty rate in Peru has reduced gradually with newfound development, and if mining corporations model Gold Field&#x27;s practices, both the corporation and the people will benefit from cooperation. In the case of Tambogrande, it seems Manhattan Minerals did not model of Gold Field&#x27;s practices or engage the community with their work which could have built trust between them and the community.

Different actors in these mining development projects in Peru offer different perspectives. &quot;The Economist&quot; writes that Gold Field&#x27;s plans to start a new mining project in Yanacocha provoked massive protests in 2004, but they were ultimately successful in garnering support for their project because Gold Fields ensured it &quot;listen[ed] more than talk and ensure[ed] that living standards improve for people in the surrounding area.&quot;

<text>Magglio José Ordóñez Delgado (; born January 28, 1974) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball right fielder. He played for the Chicago White Sox (1997–2004) and Detroit Tigers (2005–2011). Ordóñez is tall and weighs . Having posted a career .309 batting average over 15 seasons, Ordóñez retired from the major leagues as a Tiger on June 3, 2012, in a ceremony at Comerica Park prior to the afternoon game.

In 2013, he announced that he would be running for public office in his native country of Venezuela and was elected mayor of the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality on December 8, 2013.

==Professional career==
In a 15-year major league career (through the end of the 2011 season), Ordóñez was a .309 hitter with 294 home runs and 1,236 RBIs in 1,848 games. Other career totals include 1,076 runs scored, 426 doubles, .369 on-base percentage and .502 slugging percentage. He was selected for the All-Star Game six times (1999–2001, 2003, and 2006–07) and won three Silver Slugger awards (2000, 2002, and 2007). In 2007, he won the American League batting title with an average of .363. He also established a career high with 139 runs batted in, and finished runner-up to Alex Rodriguez in the AL Most Valuable Player award voting.

===Chicago White Sox (1997–2004)===

Ordóñez spent the first eight years of his major league career playing with the Chicago White Sox. In the five seasons prior to 2004, Ordóñez hit at least .300 with 29 home runs and 99 RBI, and reached the 30-home run, 100-RBI plateau in four of those seasons. He also collected over 70 extra-base hits from 2001 to 2003, but a collision with second baseman Willie Harris on Omar Vizquel&#x27;s popup to right field during a May 19, 2004, game against the Cleveland Indians, cost him two trips to the disabled list and two surgeries on his left knee. He finished with .292, 9 home runs, and 37 RBI in 52 games. During the 2001 season when Ordóñez was teammates with Jose Canseco, Canseco claims he injected Ordóñez with steroids.

During the 2003 off-season, Ordonez was almost traded to the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox and Texas Rangers had been in discussions for weeks about Boston acquiring the reigning American League MVP, SS Alex Rodriguez for outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox then agreed in principle to trade its incumbent SS Nomar Garciaparra to the White Sox for Ordonez. When the Rodriguez-for-Ramirez trade fell through, the Red Sox decided to not trade Garciaparra and the Ordonez trade was called off as well.

===Detroit Tigers (2005–2011)===
Ordóñez signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent on February 7, 2005. His five-year, $85 million contract was the second largest the Tigers had ever paid a player. Because of Ordóñez&#x27;s knee injury from the 2004 season, the contract included a clause stating that if he were to spend more than 25 days on the disabled list due to the same injury, the contract could be bought out for $3 million at the discretion of the Tigers&#x27; management.

After he signed with Detroit, Ordóñez had a public dispute with Ozzie Guillén, his former manager and teammate in Chicago. Their apparent mutual dislike for each other was a contributing factor to Ordóñez&#x27;s departure from the White Sox. However, the rivalry appears to have cooled, as Guillén actually requested Ordóñez for the 2006 All-Star Game.

In 2005, Ordóñez&#x27;s first season for Detroit, he strained an abdominal muscle during the first week of the season and spent the next three months on the disabled list, as the strain turned out to be a hernia. This caused him to rest after corrective surgery for two months following the injury, after which he began a rehabilitation assignment at the Tigers&#x27; AAA minor league team in Toledo. He returned to the Tigers&#x27; lineup in early July, and once again became a star by hitting consistently over .300 while batting clean-up.

In 2006, Ordóñez returned to All-Star form. He was selected to the 2006 All-Star Game as an injury replacement for Red Sox left fielder Manny Ramírez. At the All-Star break, Ordóñez was hitting .312 with 16 home runs and 62 RBI, and was a mainstay for a Tigers team that was a major-league best 59–29 at the break.
On October 14, 2006, Ordóñez completed the Tigers&#x27; sweep of the ALCS with a three-run homer against Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics, with two outs on a 1–0 count in the bottom of the 9th, the 8th time in MLB history that a post-season series has ended with a home run. The win sent the Tigers to their first World Series appearance since 1984. Coincidentally, it also happened 22 years to the day from when the Tigers won the World Series in that year.

Ordóñez had the best season of his career in 2007, finishing second in the American League MVP race behind Alex Rodriguez. His .363 batting average, 28 home runs and 139 RBIs could be considered one of the best seasons ever by a Detroit Tigers outfielder. Magglio&#x27;s records and accomplishments in 2007 include:
*His .363 batting average was the highest in Major League Baseball. He finished the season as the AL batting champion, and was the first Tiger player to accomplish the feat since Norm Cash in 1961. The last Tiger to hit for a higher average was Charlie Gehringer in 1937 (.371).
*His 54 doubles was the most in Major League Baseball. It was the most by a Tiger since George Kell hit 56 in 1950.
*His 139 RBIs was the highest by a Tiger since Rocky Colavito had 140 in 1961. Colavito is the only Tiger batter with more RBIs than Ordóñez in the past 60 years.
*On August 12, 2007, Ordóñez hit two home runs in an eight-run second-inning of an 11–6 win over the Oakland Athletics, becoming the second batter in Tigers&#x27; history to achieve this feat; Al Kaline had done so on April 17, 1955, in a 16–0 win over the then-Kansas City Athletics.
*Ordóñez had an on-base percentage of .434; only two other Tiger batters in the past 60 years have posted a higher on-base percentage: Tony Phillips in 1993 (.443) and Norm Cash in 1961 (.487).
*Only one Tiger in the past 60 years has had a higher slugging percentage than Magglio&#x27;s .595: Norm Cash in 1961 had a slugging percentage of .662.

On April 29, 2010, Ordóñez got his 2000th career hit against the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Carl Pavano. On July 24 Ordóñez hurt his ankle sliding into home. X-rays revealed a fracture that was expected to heal in six to eight weeks, but some weeks after the injury it was reported Magglio would miss the rest of the season. Following the season, the Tigers declined Ordóñez&#x27;s $15 million option for 2011.

On December 16, 2010, the Tigers re-signed Ordóñez to a 1-year, $10 million contract.

On October 8, 2011, during a playoff game with the Texas Rangers, Ordóñez re-fractured the ankle that he had fractured in 2010, he was then ruled out for the rest of the 2011 postseason.

On November 1, 2011, Tigers general manager David Dombrowski announced that the Tigers would &quot;most likely&quot; not offer Ordóñez a contract for the 2012 season, which makes Ordóñez a free agent. On May 29, 2012, it was reported that Ordonez would announce his retirement within the week.

On June 3, 2012, Ordóñez officially retired from major league baseball in a ceremony at Comerica Park.

In 2013, Ordóñez became co-owner of the Venezuelan professional baseball team Caribes de Anzoátegui, a team he briefly played for before coming to the United States.

==Nicknames and family==
In Detroit&#x27;s Comerica Park some Tiger fans sported curly black wigs underneath their baseball caps until mid-2009, when Ordóñez cut his hair short. He is also sometimes referred to affectionately as &quot;Maggs&quot;. In mid-2006, a group of bloggers began referring to Magglio as &quot;The Big Tilde&quot;. This nickname has been referenced on Deadspin, MLB.com, and during a Fox Sports broadcast.

Ordóñez has three children with his wife Dagly, a son named Magglio Jr. and two daughters, Maggliana and Sophia.

Ordóñez&#x27; son, Magglio Ordóñez Jr. was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft.

==Political views==
Ordóñez was a supporter of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, and in early 2009 appeared in a televised political ad which assured the Venezuelan people that &quot;the best of the revolution and socialism is yet to come.&quot; He also joined Chávez on the campaign trail. As a result, during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Ordóñez was booed by anti-Chávez Venezuelan fans, during his at bats, and while he was on the field.

In August 2013, Ordóñez announced that he would run for the office of mayor in the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality in Venezuela, on the ticket of the late Chavez&#x27;s United Socialist Party of Venezuela. It was announced on December 9, 2013, that he had been elected Mayor.

<text>José Angel Vidro (born August 27, 1974) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners.

==Professional career==

===Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals===
Vidro was drafted in the sixth round of the 1992 amateur draft by the Montreal Expos from Blanca Malaret High School in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico. He spent four seasons in the minor leagues before making his major league debut on June 8, 1997. He was primarily a reserve infielder for the Expos in 1997 and 1998. Vidro is the first of three players, including Robinson Cancel (New York Mets) and Jonathan Sánchez (San Francisco Giants), from Sabana Grande to make it to the major leagues.

In 1999, Vidro became a full-time player as the Expos starting second baseman. He hit .304 with 12 home runs and 59 RBI and was second in the National League with 45 doubles.

In 2000, Vidro was named an All-Star for the first time in his career. His career high .330 batting average on the season was seventh-best in the NL. His 200 hits were second-best in the NL and his 51 doubles were good for third-best. He also set career high numbers with 24 home runs and 97 RBI. Vidro continued as the starting second baseman for the Expos in 2001 when he hit .319 with 15 home runs and 59 RBI.

Vidro made the NL All-Star team in both 2002 and 2003, hitting over .300 both seasons and winning the Silver Slugger as the best hitting 2nd baseman in the NL in 2003. Vidro played three more seasons with the franchise, including the first two seasons when the Expos moved and became the Washington Nationals. Due to injuries to his right knee, ankle, and quadriceps muscle, Vidro played in only 87 games for the Washington Nationals in 2005, 8 of which were as a pinch hitter.

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 14, 2006, the Nationals traded Vidro to the Seattle Mariners for outfielder Chris Snelling and pitcher Emiliano Fruto. Vidro spent two seasons with Seattle primarily playing DH. He hit .314 in 147 games in 2007, but hit only six home runs while slugging .394.

On August 5, 2008, the Mariners designated Vidro for assignment, and he was released on August 13. He was hitting .234 with seven home runs and 45 RBI at the time.

===Career statistics===

Vidro played 1046 games at second base, 45 games at third base, 42 games at first base and 3 games at left field.

<doc id="625502" wikidata="Q5413218" url="?curid=625502" title="Relief Society Magazine">
<text>Relief Society Magazine was the official publication of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1915 to 1970. It succeeded the earlier and privately owned &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot;, which was begun in 1872. The magazine was an important publishing outlet for Utah women, and was run by women editors. The founding editor, Susa Young Gates, edited the magazine from 1915 to 1922. The December 1970 issue of the &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; was its last. The LDS Church discontinued the magazine as part of the implementation of the Priesthood Correlation Program. Thus, the magazine and several others within the church were replaced by the &quot;Ensign&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; started with the &quot;Relief Society Bulletin&quot; of 1914, starting the same year that &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; stopped. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; was renamed &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; in 1915. 

Though &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; was incredibly popular with subscriptions exceeding 4,000, Susa Young Gates believed the Relief Society could reach even more people by changing the format of their distributions. At the turn of the twentieth century, magazines became the preferred means of distributing literature because they were more accessible to a wider audience. The magazine began as a black and white one dollar pocketbook but began printing in color in 1962.

After World War II, the Relief Society Magazine began publishing pro-motherhood and anti-work themes in its pages. This style, while influenced by the culture of the nation, also influence the domestic motherhood sentiment among women in The Church. However, not all subscribers were persuaded. Certain women working at the Manti Parachute Plant in Manti, Utah vocalized their belief that women could handle the workforce and domestic care.

=== Circulation ===

The &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; was distributed and printed from the Relief Society Office Building in Salt Lake City, Utah. Statistics come from &quot;A History of the Relief Society Magazine.&quot;

Starting in 1966, the Relief Society began publishing a Spanish edition of the magazine to reach the ever-growing Hispanic population of The Church. This contributed to the massive increase in subscribers in the late 1960s.
== Content ==
There was a wide variety of content available for the subscribers of the magazine, the curriculums and lessons, the &quot;Notes from the Field,&quot; contests, the most famous of which was the Eliza R. Snow Poetry competition. After World War II the magazine shifted focus from political activities and global missionary work to sewing projects and charity organizations. Additionally, the magazine was the inspiration for many songs including &quot;Our Magazine.&quot; 

=== Relief Society Curriculums/Lessons ===
The magazine dispersed the monthly Relief Society Curriculums illustrating what each lesson was to be on. Lesson topics ranged from bible chapters for home reading to the importance of theatre and the arts to the role Jesus as savior. These lessons were to be taught be designated instructors during the weekly meetings of the Relief Society organization in the various congregations throughout the world. An instruction circular advised Relief Society stakes that wards should prioritize the official curricula, writing that they would be &quot;mistaken&quot; to &quot;reject that which has been prepared by proper authority.&quot; Susa Young Gates initially wrote the monthly lessons for genealogy.

=== &quot;Notes from the Field&quot; ===
Early on, the magazine was nearly as far reaching as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The most reliable way this happened was through the paid subscriptions of missionaries that were spread throughout the globe. The magazine began incorporating this diversified readership through a regular column titled &quot;Notes from the Field&quot;, which described some of the experiences that missionaries around the world were having. This column spanned nearly two decades, lasting from the magazine&#x27;s beginnings in 1915 until its last edition in 1934. Amy Brown Lyman (pictured) wrote and edited this column for the majority of its existence.

One example of just how far the magazine was carried can be found in the July 1923 issue. In the &quot;Notes from the Field&quot; section of this issue, missionaries are pictured with the officers of the Relief Society in Aleppo, Syria (then part of the French mandated State of Aleppo). The magazine&#x27;s importance in the lives of those missionaries was evidenced by the experiences of the missionaries. In the diary of Joseph W. Booth, one of the pictured missionaries in Syria, he recounts the time he received that July edition, and showed it to the local members.

In addition there was a column entitled &quot;Notes to the Field&quot; which gave official instructions and guidance straight from the Presidency of the Relief Society to the wards and organizations throughout the world.

=== Contests ===
To promote literary excellence among church members, in 1923 the magazine began hosting its first poetry contest. Contestants would submit their work to the magazine, which would then vote and reward a winner whose work would be featured in the next magazine. The contests portion expanded to include the Eliza R. Snow Poetry Contest, changed to the Relief Society Poem contest in 1967, the song contest in 1933 and again in 1968, and the Relief Society Short Story Contest which began in 1942 to celebrate the centennial of the Relief Society Organization.

== Discontinuation ==
There were many factors that contributed to the eventual discontinuation of the &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; in 1970. A continually growing global audience, expansion of male authorship, and a limited access to all writers all played a significant role; however, these all culminated in the Priesthood Correlation Program in December 1970. As a way to create uniformity within The Church, leadership created the &quot;Ensign&quot; and the &quot;New Era&quot; and discontinued a variety of publications besides the &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot;. These included the &quot;Improvement Era&quot;, the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, and &quot;The Instructor&quot;.

Though the magazine contained inclusive columns such as &quot;Notes from the Field&quot;, these still told the international stories from the perspective of the American missionaries. The magazine overall was not made to incorporate an international audience- at least until the addition of the Spanish version of the magazine in 1966. The number of authors who were men steadily increased throughout the magazine&#x27;s lifespan. Just 20% of articles were written by men in 1930, but that number jumped to 33% in 1956. The Relief Society Curriculum section of the magazine also had 75% of the lessons written by men in that same year. The previously published &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; contained articles written by everyday members of The Church. Conversely, the &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; contained articles written by Church leadership, specifically being controlled by the Relief Society Organization.

== Legacy ==
Despite the magazines shortcomings in securing ordinary members and female authorship, when the magazine was discontinued many women refused subscriptions to the new &quot;Ensign&quot;. When an eighty-four year old woman lost her sight due to age, she wrote the magazine in March 1969 saying: Dear Relief Society Magazine: It is with regret and tears that I must say good-bye. My sight is so bad and no repairs can be given it, so I cannot read you anymore. For thirty years and more I have enjoyed you, but now I am unable to read the wonderful stories and articles. Good-bye Magazine. I hate so to see you go...

<doc id="625507" wikidata="Q670022" url="?curid=625507" title="Windows Calculator">
<text>Windows Calculator is a software calculator developed by Microsoft and included in Windows. In its Windows 10 incarnation it has four modes: standard, scientific, programmer, and a graphing mode. The standard mode includes a number pad and buttons for performing arithmetic operations. The scientific mode takes this a step further and adds exponents and trigonometric function, and programmer mode allows the user to perform operations related to computer programming. In 2020, a graphing mode was added to the Calculator, allowing users to graph equations on a coordinate plane.

The Windows Calculator is one of a few applications that have been bundled in all versions of Windows, starting with Windows 1.0. Since then, the calculator has been upgraded with various capabilities.

In addition, the calculator has also been included with Windows Phone and Xbox One. The Microsoft Store page proclaims HoloLens support as of February 2024, but the Calculator app is not installed on HoloLens by default.

==History==
A simple arithmetic calculator was first included with Windows 1.0.

In Windows 3.0, a scientific mode was added, which included exponents and roots, logarithms, factorial-based functions, trigonometry (supports radian, degree and gradians angles), base conversions (2, 8, 10, 16), logic operations, statistical functions such as single variable statistics and linear regression.

===Windows 9x and Windows NT 4.0===
Until Windows 95, it uses an IEEE 754-1985 double-precision floating-point, and the highest representable number by the calculator is 21024, which is slightly above 10308 (≈1.80 × 10308).

In Windows 98 and later, it uses an arbitrary-precision arithmetic library, replacing the standard IEEE floating point library. It offers bignum precision for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and 32 digits of precision for advanced operations (square root, transcendental functions). The largest value that can be represented on the Windows Calculator is currently and the smallest is . (Also ! calculates the gamma function which is defined over all real numbers, only excluding the negative integers).

===Windows 2000, XP and Vista===
In Windows 2000, digit grouping is added. Degree and base settings are added to menu bar.

The calculators of Windows XP and Vista were able to calculate using numbers beyond 1010000, but calculating with these numbers (e.g. 10^2^2^2^2^2^2^2...) does increasingly slow down the calculator and make it unresponsive until the calculation has been completed.

Unlike later versions, calculating with binary/decimal/hexadecimal/octal numbers is included into scientific mode.

===Windows 7===
In Windows 7, separate programmer, statistics, unit conversion, date calculation, and worksheets modes were added. Tooltips were removed. Furthermore, Calculator&#x27;s interface was revamped for the first time since its introduction. The base conversion functions were moved to the programmer mode and statistics functions were moved to the statistics mode. Switching between modes does not preserve the current number, clearing it to 0.

The highest number is now limited to 1010000 again.

In every mode except programmer mode, one can see the history of calculations. The app was redesigned to accommodate multi-touch. Standard mode behaves as a simple checkbook calculator; entering the sequence 6 * 4 + 12 / 4 - 4 * 5 gives the answer 25. In scientific mode, order of operations is followed while doing calculations (multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction), which means 6 * 4 + 12 / 4 - 4 * 5 = &lt;samp&gt;7&lt;/samp&gt;.

In programmer mode, inputting a number in decimal has a lower and upper limit, depending on the data type, and must always be an integer. Data type of number in decimal mode is signed n-bit integer when converting from number in hexadecimal, octal, or binary mode.
On the right side of the main Calculator, one can add a panel with date calculation, unit conversion and worksheets. Worksheets allow one to calculate a result of a chosen field based on the values of other fields. Pre-defined templates include calculating a car&#x27;s fuel economy (mpg and L/100 km), a vehicle lease, and a mortgage. In pre-beta versions of Windows 7, Calculator also provided a Wages template.

===Windows 8.1===
While the traditional Calculator is still included with Windows 8.1, a Metro-style Calculator is also present, featuring a full-screen interface as well as normal, scientific, and conversion modes.

===Windows 10===
The Calculator in non-LTSC editions of Windows 10 is a Universal Windows Platform app. In contrast, Windows 10 LTSC (which does not include universal Windows apps) includes the traditional calculator, but which is now named . Both calculators provide the features of the traditional calculator included with Windows 7 and Windows 8.x, such as unit conversions for volume, length, weight, temperature, energy, area, speed, time, power, data, pressure and angle, and the history list which the user can clear.

Both the universal Windows app and LTSC&#x27;s register themselves with the system as handlers of a &quot; pseudo-protocol. This registration is similar to that performed by any other well-behaved application when it registers itself as a handler for a filetype (e.g. ) or protocol (e.g. ).

All Windows 10 editions (both LTSC and non-LTSC) continue to have a , which however is just a stub that launches (via ShellExecute) the handler that is associated with the &quot; pseudo-protocol. As with any other protocol or filetype, when there are multiple handlers to choose from, users are free to choose which handler they prefer either via the classic control panel (&#x27;Default programs&#x27; settings) or the immersive UI settings (&#x27;Default Apps&#x27; settings) or from the command prompt via .

In the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, a currency converter mode was added to Calculator.

On 6 March 2019, Microsoft released the source code for Calculator on GitHub under the MIT License.

=== Windows 11 ===
In Windows 11, the Calculator app&#x27;s user interface was modified to match the design of Windows 11 and a new settings page is present for users to toggle between the themes of the app without changing the operating system&#x27;s theme. In 2021, Microsoft announced it would migrate the codebase of the Calculator app to C# in order to welcome more developers to contribute to the app.

== Gallery ==
==Features==
By default, Calculator runs in standard mode, which resembles a four-function calculator. More advanced functions are available in scientific mode, including logarithms, numerical base conversions, some logical operators, operator precedence, radian, degree and gradians support as well as simple single-variable statistical functions. It does not provide support for user-defined functions, complex numbers, storage variables for intermediate results (other than the classic accumulator memory of pocket calculators), automated polar-cartesian coordinates conversion, or support for two-variables statistics.

In addition, the programming mode allows conversions between bases 16, 10, 8, and 2, the most commonly used by programmers. In this mode, the on-screen numeric keypad includes the hexadecimal digits A through F, which are active when &quot;Hex&quot; is selected. In hex mode, only integers are supported.

Calculator supports keyboard shortcuts; all Calculator features have an associated keyboard shortcut.

Calculator in programmer mode cannot accept or display a number larger than a signed QWORD (16 hexadecimal digits/64 bits). The largest number it can handle is therefore 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (decimal 9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Any calculations in programmer mode which exceed this limit will overflow, even if those calculations would succeed in other modes. In particular, scientific notation is not available in this mode.

==Issues==
* In Windows 7, 8, and some versions of Windows 10, transcendental function operations, such as the square root operator (codice_1), would sometimes be calculated incorrectly due to catastrophic cancelation. In newer versions, this doesn&#x27;t happen with integers, but it still happens when you enter decimal numbers.
* Older versions of the universal Calculator in non-LTSC editions of Windows 10 doesn&#x27;t use any regional format (can be set in Region Control Panel) that are different from the app&#x27;s display language for number formatting (the app&#x27;s language is English (United States) but Windows&#x27;s regional format is set to a different format).

==Calculator Plus==
Calculator Plus is a separate application for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users that adds a &#x27;Conversion&#x27; mode over the Windows XP version of the Calculator. The &#x27;Conversion&#x27; mode supports unit conversion and currency conversion. Currency exchange rates can be updated using the built-in update feature, which downloads exchange rates from the European Central Bank.

<doc id="625508" wikidata="Q6715011" url="?curid=625508" title="Maimonides Park">
<text>Maimonides Park (formerly MCU Park and KeySpan Park) is a minor league baseball stadium on the Riegelmann Boardwalk in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. The home team and primary tenant is the New York Mets-affiliated Brooklyn Cyclones of the South Atlantic League. The stadium has also hosted other teams and sports; the NYU Violets Baseball team began playing at Maimonides Park in 2015, and soccer club Brooklyn FC will have its women&#x27;s team playing at the ballpark in 2024, with its men&#x27;s team joining them in 2025.

The official seating capacity at Maimonides Park is 7,000, though the Cyclones sell up to 2,500 more standing-room tickets. Prior to 2016, the capacity was 7,500 plus 2,500 standing room. Features include a concourse with free-standing concession buildings and overhanging fluorescent lamps in different colors, evoking an amusement park atmosphere. In addition, the park overlooks the Atlantic Ocean as well as the Parachute Jump in right field, and the Wonder Wheel and Coney Island Cyclone in left field.

== Site ==
Maimonides Park stands on the old site of Steeplechase Park, an old-time Coney Island amusement park that closed in 1964 amid crime and general deterioration of Coney Island and of the subway routes that run to the area. Maimonides Park is accessible via the New York City Subway at the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue station, served by the .

== History ==
Part of a general reinvestment in the Coney Island neighborhood, the stadium opened in 2001 as KeySpan Park, which had a capacity of 6,500. The opening of the park, and the Cyclones&#x27; permanent move there from their prior temporary home in Queens, marked the return of professional baseball to Brooklyn—albeit on a minor-league level—for the first time since MLB&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers had played their last game at Ebbets Field in 1957 before moving to California the following season. Demand for Cyclones tickets was so great that the team added 1,000 seats in a right-field bleacher pavilion within three weeks after the park opened.

Maimonides Park and the Staten Island Yankees&#x27; Richmond County Bank Ballpark were paid for with public money, part of a deal that involved both the Mets and Yankees. The Yankees had to approve the arrival of the Cyclones, and the Mets had to approve a Yankee farm team in Staten Island. The two teams share MLB territorial rights to the New York City market, and have veto power over each other (and any other MLB organization).

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit Brooklyn and caused extensive damage to the ballpark, including the front office, clubhouses, and team store. The entire playing surface, previously a natural grass field, had to be replaced with synthetic FieldTurf before the 2013 season.

=== Naming rights ===

The park&#x27;s original name was part of a naming rights deal with KeySpan Energy, a utility company whose primary holding is the former Brooklyn Union Gas, until 2020. However, in 2007, KeySpan was acquired by United Kingdom-based National Grid plc, who retired the KeySpan name. On January 29, 2010, the Cyclones announced that they had ended the deal with National Grid, because the KeySpan name no longer existed. On February 4, 2010, it was announced that the Municipal Credit Union, the city&#x27;s largest credit union, signed an agreement for the ballpark to be called MCU Park in an eleven-year naming rights deal.

In 2021, MCU did not renew the naming rights deal. Maimonides Medical Center became the new sponsor.

== Policies ==
Maimonides Park prohibits fans from bringing outside food into the stadium, a policy in every minor league stadium, but not in effect at Citi Field and Yankee Stadium.

==Baseball==

In 2005 and 2014, MCU Park hosted the New York–Penn League All-Star Game.

In early 2015, the New York University Violets moved in and made Maimonides Park their home stadium. In the process, they forced the St. Joseph&#x27;s College Bears to move out. Baruch College plays a few games at Maimonides Park, as do a few high school teams.

Following the 2015 season, a set of bleachers were removed, removing 500 seats from the ballpark. The area which housed the bleachers was turned into a picnic area.

Maimonides Park hosted a qualifying round for the 2017 World Baseball Classic in September 2016. Israel won the Qualifier over Great Britain, Brazil &amp; Pakistan.

Maimonides Park served as the Mets&#x27; alternate training site in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the Minor League Baseball campaign and the shortening of the Major League Baseball season.

As part of the restructuring of Minor League Baseball over the 2020–21 offseason, it was announced the Cyclones would continue to operate in the Mets farm system, now their High-A team playing in the new High-A East.

==Other uses==
===Soccer===
In February 2017, the New York Cosmos officially announced they would host their home games at Maimonides Park for the 2017 NASL season. The Cosmos had previously used Maimonides Park as a home field: once for a regular season match against the Ottawa Fury and once for a post season match against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, both in 2015. The NASL cancelled its 2018 season, and the Cosmos later announced they will move to Mitchel Athletic Complex in Nassau County for their 2019 home games.

On January 19, 2024, it was announced that new USL Championship expansion side Brooklyn FC planned to play home matches at Maimonides Park for their inaugural 2025 season. On February 10, 2024, Brooklyn FC announced that it had been granted an additional expansion side in the new first-division women&#x27;s league USL Super League, to begin play at Maimonides Park for the 2024 season.

===Football===
The Brooklyn Bolts played their home games at Maimonides Park during the 2014 and 2015 Fall Experimental Football League seasons before folding. The football field was positioned in the outfield.

===Rugby===
Rugby United New York played its first two Major League Rugby seasons at MCU Park before moving to Cochrane Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey.

===Other===
The ballpark hosted the annual Nathan&#x27;s Famous Hot Dog Contest on July 4, 2021. The contest is usually held in a public plaza on Coney Island (at the location of The Original Nathan&#x27;s Restaurant on the corner of Surf and Stillwell), but, for 2021, was temporarily relocated due to capacity restrictions and other health and safety requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that event, Joey Chestnut set a world record of 76 hot dogs and buns within 10 minutes.

<doc id="625512" wikidata="Q1238681" url="?curid=625512" title="Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant">
<text>Antoine Girard, sieur de Saint-Amant (September 30, 1594December 29, 1661) was a French poet.

Saint-Amant was born near Rouen. His father was a merchant who had, according to his son&#x27;s account, been a sailor and had commanded for 22 years &quot;une escadre de la reine Elizabeth&quot; – a vague statement that lacks confirmation. The son obtained a patent of nobility, and attached himself to different great noblemen – the duc de Retz and the comte d&#x27;Harcourt among others. He saw military service and sojourned at different times in Italy, in England – a sojourn which provoked from him a violent poetical attack on the country, &quot;Albion&quot; (1643) – in Poland, where he held a court appointment for two years, and elsewhere. Saint-Amant&#x27;s later years were spent in France; and he died at Paris.

Saint-Amant has left a considerable body of poetry. His &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Rome ridicule&quot; set the fashion of the burlesque poem. In his later years he devoted himself to serious subjects and produced an epic, &quot;Moyse sauvé&quot; (1653). His other work consists of Bacchanalian songs, his &quot;Débauche&quot; being one of the most remarkable convivial poems of its kind.

<doc id="625514" wikidata="Q188888" url="?curid=625514" title="List of Teachers' Days">
<text>Teachers&#x27; Day is a special day for the appreciation of teachers. It may include celebrations to honor them for their special contributions in a particular field area, or the community tone in education. This is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days. For example, Argentina has commemorated Domingo Faustino Sarmiento&#x27;s death on 11 September as Teachers&#x27; Day since 1915. In India, the birthday of the second president Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, 5 September, is celebrated as Teachers&#x27; Day since 1962.

Many countries celebrate their Teachers&#x27; Day on 5 October in conjunction with World Teachers&#x27; Day, which was established by UNESCO in 1994.

== Dates by country/region ==


A day for homeschool teacher appreciation has been suggested, which several homeschooling groups subsequently organized. A United States &quot;parents as teachers day&quot; has existed on 8 November since the 1970s. While this initially focussed on the role of parents in early-childhood learning, some homeschoolers use it to acknowledge the primacy of the parental role in education.

<doc id="625517" wikidata="Q6960517" url="?curid=625517" title="Naked as Water">
<text>Naked as Water, by Mario Azzopardi, is a book of poems written originally in Maltese. Mario Azzopardi (born 1944) should not be confused with Mario Philip Azzopardi (who has made a career in film-making in Canada). The former Azzopardi is a poet, short story writer, university lecturer and cultural columnist and is the incumbent principal of the Malta Drama Centre. He made his first mark as a leading, radical poet in the nineteen-sixties. &quot;Naked as Water&quot; is a collection of verse by Mario Azzopardi, translated by Professor Grazio Falzon.

== Summary ==
The poems in this collection have been arranged into five sections:

*Nocturnes and Visions — poems of angst, nightmares, scenes from the village and city.
*Anima — poems about women.
*The Seven-Headed Dragon — poems about the larger-than-life poet and his quest.
*Equinox — poems on religious themes.
*Tombstone With No Epitaph — abstract poems, poems on geometric relationships, poems about poetry itself.

== Reviews ==
&quot;... Azzopardi&#x27;s poems speak forcefully about Malta&#x27;s history and independence as a culture.&quot;

&quot;In Malta the catchphrase associated with Mario Azzopardi -- poet, teacher of literature and drama producer -- is enfant terrible.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Naked As Water&quot; is a very exotic volume... The poems themselves are a studied primitivism filled with the primal reality of sea, sun and moon, but always with a sophisticated awareness of the &#x27;isms&#x27; of twentieth-century art and literature. This is a very valuable book out of one last minority world of Europe that demands its place on the literary map.&quot;

<doc id="625529" wikidata="Q2826926" url="?curid=625529" title="Agnes Scott College">
<text>Agnes Scott College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Decatur, Georgia. The college enrolls approximately 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The college is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and is considered one of the Seven Sisters of the South. It also offers co-educational graduate programs.

==History==
The college was founded in 1889 as Decatur Female Seminary by Presbyterian minister Frank Henry Gaines. In 1890, the name was changed to Agnes Scott Institute to honor the mother of the college&#x27;s primary benefactor, Col. George Washington Scott. The name was changed again to Agnes Scott College in 1906 and remains today a women&#x27;s college.

Agnes Scott is considered the first higher education institution in the state of Georgia to receive regional accreditation. The ninth and current president since July 2018 is Leocadia I. Zak, who previously worked as director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

On July 27, 1994, the campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the &quot;South Candler Street-Agnes Scott College Historic District&quot;. The historic district boundaries are East College Ave., South McDonough St., S. Candler St., East Hill St. and East Davis St. It includes the entire campus, as well as historic homes adjacent to the campus. The campus is also designated by the City of Decatur as a historic district.

The Reverend Frank Henry Gaines served as the first President of Agnes Scott, formally known as Decatur Female Seminary School, for 27 years (1896–1923). During his 27-year presidency, he ensured stability and success for the school, including the transition to the collegiate level, accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, acquisition of 20 acres of land and 21 buildings and an increase in assets from $5,000 to $1.5 million.

==Campus==
Agnes Scott College is located within walking distance of downtown Decatur. A MARTA subway station, located in downtown Decatur, and bus stops allows students to travel to the greater Atlanta area.


Agnes Scott occupies more than in Decatur. The college also owns the Avery Glen apartments as well as more than a dozen houses in the surrounding neighborhoods housing faculty, staff, and students. There are also six dedicated undergraduate dormitories located on campus.

American poet Robert Frost was first invited to speak at Agnes Scott in 1935, by English professor Emma May Laney, and he visited the college every winter from 1945 until his death in 1963. During his visits, he would read poetry in Presser Hall. A statue of the poet sculpted by George W. Lundeen sits in the alumnae gardens. A collection of Robert Frost&#x27;s poetry and letters can be viewed on the second floor of the McCain Library.

=== Current Buildings ===

==== Agnes Scott (Main) Hall ====
Agnes Scott (Main) Hall, named after Agnes Irvine Scott, is located at the center of &quot;the main loop&quot; and is a one among many Agnes Scott buildings that was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Main was built in 1891, making it the oldest building on campus. Main once housed the entire school. This is documented in the history of Agnes Scott by McNair titled &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; published in 1983. As technology became more advanced so did Main. Main Hall was the first building on campus and in the neighborhood to have electric lighting. Some say that people would gather outside of Main at night just to admire the light shining within the building.

==== Gazebo ====
Built in 1891, the Gazebo at Agnes Scott college has served a multitude of purposes throughout the years. It was originally located in front of Agnes Scott (Main) Hall, however in 1926 it was moved to the west end of Rebekah Scott Hall. The gazebo has been used as an office, meeting room, meditation chapel, and the Day Student Hut.

==== Rebekah Scott Hall ====
Built in 1906, Rebekah Scott Hall is the second oldest building remaining at Agnes Scott College. Rebekah Scott Hall cost $70,000 to build. It is named after George Washington Scott&#x27;s wife, Rebekah Butcher Scott. The first floor of Rebekah Scott Hall contains offices, the office of financial aid, and the office of admissions. The second and third floors are used as student housing.

==== Jennie D. Inman Hall (Inman Hall) ====
Jennie D. Inman Hall, known commonly as Inman Hall, was built in 1911 and is the oldest building at Agnes Scott College which is used exclusively for student housing. In 1985, Inman had major renovations and the third floor was converted into study spaces for students. Jennie D. Inman Hall is 170 by 50 feet. It is made from Indiana limestone and is three stories high. The building faces west and has a large veranda which stretches along the front of the building. Jennie D, Inman Hall was gifted to Agnes Scott College by Samuel. M. Inman in memory of his wife, Jennie D. Inman.

==== Anna Young Alumnae House ====
Built in 1923, the Anna Young Alumnae House is dedicated to former science professor and Agnes Scott alumnae, Anna Irwin Young. Originally the Alumnae House was a central gathering place for ASC alumnae. The house and bedrooms are now used as a campus guest house. Behind the house is the Alumnae Garden which houses a statue honoring Robert Frost. The Anna Young Alumnae House underwent renovations from 2005 until 2009, after which it was re-opened.

==== Bradly Observatory ====
The Bradley Observatory at Agnes Scott houses the Beck Telescope, a Cassegrain reflector, as well as a planetarium with 70-seat capacity and a radio telescope. Recently Agnes Scott College and the Georgia Tech Research Institute have collaborated on a project that added a LIDAR facility to the observatory.

==== Bullock Science Center ====
The college&#x27;s science building, the Bullock Science Center, contains a three-story rendering of part of the nucleotide sequence from Agnes Scott&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA. The DNA came from a blood sample of an ASC alumna who is a direct descendant of the college&#x27;s namesake.

===Sustainability===
Agnes Scott has committed to becoming a carbon-neutral institute by the college&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2039 and has taken steps such as partnering with the Clean Air Campaign to reduce its impact on the local environment.

, the college has five solar arrays, four of which are part of Georgia Power&#x27;s Advanced Solar Initiative. The fifth array is on the rooftop of the Bradley Observatory and is also used for student research. The renovation of Campbell Hall into a mixed use residence hall, learning center, and office space was concluded in 2014 and included installation of a hydro-geothermic HVAC system. The college also hosts a Zipcar.

This new library was called the &quot;Carnegie Library&quot; and the original library was turned into a student center. It was renamed in 1951 for James McCain, on the occasion of his retirement as the 2nd President of the college. In 1974-1977 and again in 1999–2000, the library underwent renovations.

== Student life ==

===Diversity===
The fall of 2023 ethnicities of the undergraduate student body were: 0.4% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 5% Asian, 34% Black or African American, 38% White, 13% Hispanic/Latino, 3% non-resident Alien, 6% two or more races, and 1% other or unknown. Approximately 60% of undergraduates that year were from Georgia.

===Housing===
Given Agnes Scott&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;mak[ing] lifelong friends, shar[ing] unforgettable experiences, discover[ing] meaningful places and find[ing] belonging in [their] community,&quot; a majority of students are encouraged to live on campus. Thus, most students are expected to live in on-campus housing for all four years as an undergraduate at Agnes Scott College. However, the proportion of commuter students has increased (from 15.6 to 18.0 percent between the 2014–2015 and 2019–2020 academic year) due to limited housing caused from an increase in the student population (from 849 to 986 total students) and renovations to the residence halls.

There are six resident halls situated around the Northern edge of the campus: Winship, Walters, Inman, Rebekah, Campbell and Agnes Scott Hall (nicknamed &quot;Main&quot;).

===Student organizations===
There are over 60 student organizations on campus. Sororities are prohibited.

===Publications===
The college hosts several student publications, including &quot;The Silhouette&quot;, the college&#x27;s yearbook published annually, and &quot;The Aurora&quot;, Agnes Scott&#x27;s literary magazine, and &quot;The Profile&quot;, Agnes Scott newspaper. All students are invited to join the staff.

<text>The Hunts () by Amelia Biagioni, is a book of poems written originally in Spanish. It was originally published in 1976.

== Publication ==
The book was originally published in Spanish in 1976. An English translation was published by Xenos Books in 2003, translated by Renata Treitel.

== Themes ==
The book contains themes of dynamism, with a &quot;longing for communion&quot; and dualistic elements; in the words of one commentator, &quot;Good and evil, light and darkness, the hunter and the prey are the obverse and the reverse&quot;. One commentator described a poem in the work, &quot;Oh tenebrosa fulgurante&quot;, as showing that &quot;writing has become a ritual of devouring the subject in its character as a closed instance and origin or cause of artistic practice, in order to convert it into its effect.&quot;

== Reception ==
Rafael Carlos Quesada, writing for the newspaper &quot;El Litoral&quot;, described the work as advancing Biagioni in her &quot;profound inquiry that brings her closer to metaphysics&quot;, calling its structure hermetic through its usage of obscure and hard to understand terms. He argued that though this may seem strange to some readers, through exploring it one would find &quot;the permanence of Amelia Biagioni&quot;, and that the book was filled with complex themes that made it hard to simplify.

<doc id="625534" wikidata="Q14595679" url="?curid=625534" title="Ensign (rank)">
<text>Ensign (; Late Middle English, from Old French (), from Latin (plural)) is a junior rank of a commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries, normally in the infantry or navy. As the junior officer in an infantry regiment was traditionally the carrier of the regimental colours, the rank acquired the name. This rank has generally been replaced in army ranks by second lieutenant. Ensigns were generally the lowest-ranking commissioned officer, except where the rank of subaltern existed. In contrast, the Arab rank of ensign, لواء, &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot;, derives from the command of units with an ensign, not the carrier of such a unit&#x27;s ensign, and is today the equivalent of a major general.

In Thomas Venn&#x27;s 1672 &quot;Military and Maritime Discipline in Three Books&quot;, the duties of ensigns are to include not only carrying the colour but assisting the captain and lieutenant of a company and in their absence, have their authority.

&quot;Ensign&quot; is &quot;enseigne&quot; in French, and &quot;chorąży&quot; in Polish, each of which derives from a term for a flag. The Spanish &quot;alférez&quot; and Portuguese &quot;alferes&quot; is a junior officer rank below lieutenant associated with carrying the flag, and so is often translated as &quot;ensign&quot;. Unlike the rank in other languages, its etymology has nothing to do with flags, but instead comes from the Arabic for &quot;cavalier&quot; or &quot;knight&quot;. &quot;Fähnrich&quot; in German comes from an older German military title, &quot;Fahnenträger&quot; (flag bearer); however, it is an officer cadet rank, not a junior officer – the same applies to the Dutch &quot;vaandrig&quot;, which has a parallel etymology. The Finnish &quot;vänrikki&quot; is derived from the same Germanic root word through Swedish &quot;fänrik&quot;, but denotes the lowest rank of reserve officer in the Finnish ground forces, and is distinct from cadet ranks. In the Swedish armed forces, &quot;fänrik&quot; is the lowest commissioned rank. In the German &quot;Landsknecht&quot; armies (c. 1480), the equivalent rank of cornet existed for those men who carried the troop standard (known as a &quot;cornet&quot;). It is still used in the artillery and cavalry units of the Netherlands (&quot;kornet&quot;).

== Canada ==
In the Royal Canadian Navy, as explained below, the ranks &quot;Enseigne de vaisseau de 1re classe&quot; and &quot;Enseigne de vaisseau de 2e classe&quot; are the French equivalents for Sub-Lieutenant and Acting Sub-Lieutenant, respectively.

In the Canadian Army, Ensign &quot;(Enseigne)&quot; is the distinctive rank for Second-Lieutenant in the Guards Regiments.

== Estonia ==
In Estonian Defence Forces the equivalent of “ensign” is &quot;lipnik&quot;. It is used mainly as a rank for reserve officers.

==French speaking countries ==

During the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; in France, as in other countries, the ensign (&quot;enseigne&quot;) was the banner of an infantry regiment. As in other countries, the name began to be used for the officers who carried the ensign. It was renamed sub-lieutenant (&quot;sous-lieutenant&quot;) at the end of the 18th century.
The Navy used a rank of ship-of-the-line ensign (&quot;enseigne de vaisseau&quot;), which was the first officer rank. It was briefly renamed ship-of-the-line sub-lieutenant (&quot;sous-lieutenant de vaisseau&quot;) in the end of the 18th century, but its original name was soon restored.

Within many French speaking countries, the rank is still used in the naval forces. The ranks are usually split into a first and second class ( and respectively).

==New Zealand==
The Royal New Zealand Navy, unlike the Royal Navy – whose uniforms, insignia, and traditions it inherited – created the ensign grade to equal the lowest commissioned RNZAF grade of pilot officer and the New Zealand Army grade of second lieutenant. It ranks above the grade of midshipman. Like the grade of pilot officer, it uses a single thin strip of braid.

The fact that the Royal Navy has no real equivalent to the lowest commissioned Royal Air Force and British Army grades was one of the driving factors behind the RNZN&#x27;s decision to create the ensign grade. Another was that, at the time, New Zealand was actively involved with the United States Armed Forces, so it made sense to balance the rank system out with that used by the United States Navy.

==United Kingdom==
Until 1871, when it was replaced by second lieutenant, ensign was the lowest rank of commissioned officer in infantry regiments of the British Army (except fusilier and rifle regiments, and the Marines, which always used second lieutenant). It was the duty of officers of this rank to carry the colours of the regiment. In the 16th century, &quot;ensign&quot; was corrupted into &quot;ancient&quot;, and was used in the two senses of a banner and the bearer of the banner. Today, the term &quot;ensign&quot; is still used by the Foot Guards regiments, for instance during the ceremony of trooping the colour. The equivalent cavalry rank was cornet, also being derived from the name of a banner.

==United States==

===Army===
The rank of ensign was established in the U.S. Army by the act of September 29, 1789, (the first act of legislation after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution); each of the eight companies in the Regiment of Infantry was authorized one captain, one lieutenant and one ensign. With the passage of the act of April 30, 1790, the number of companies in the regiment of infantry was increased to 12 and each of the companies was authorized the same number of officers. The act of March 3, 1791 added a second regiment to the Army strength, doubling the total number of ensigns.

With the organization of the Legion of the United States authorized by the act of March 5, 1792, ensigns were retained in the companies of infantry and were included in the authorized strength of companies of rifles; in addition, cornets were added to the companies of dragoons.

The ranks of ensign and cornet were abolished in the United States Army in the Army Organization Act of 1815.

===Navy===
In the United States Navy, the rank of ensign superseded passed midshipman in 1862. Ensign is the junior commissioned officer rank in the United States Navy, the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps. This rank is also used in the U.S. Maritime Service and the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps. Ensign ranks below lieutenant junior grade, and it is equivalent to a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force.

Where a newly commissioned ensign is assigned in the Navy is dependent on status as either an unrestricted line, restricted line, or staff corps officer. For unrestricted line officers, depending on assignment to which warfare community, prospective Surface Warfare Officers (SWO) will spend 22 weeks at Surface Warfare Officer School followed by assignment to a warship for qualification as a SWO. Prospective Submarine Warfare Officers will attend Naval Nuclear Power School for 26 weeks, followed by Nuclear Power Training Unit (Prototype) for 24 weeks and Submarine Officer Basic Course for 12 weeks before reporting to their first submarine. Prospective Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers have a 12 to 18 month flight training track to earn their wings, followed by a six to nine-month training track in a Fleet Replacement Squadron before being assigned to fly combat aircraft in a deployable Fleet aviation squadron. Sea-Air-Land (SEAL) Special Warfare Officers attend a 6-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) course followed by a 4-month SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) course before assignment to a SEAL Team. Finally, Special Operations Officers, primarily Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) / Diver officers will have a training track similar in length to that of SEAL officers, to include schools for EOD, SCUBA, hard hat diving, airborne (parachutists) and combat arms skills training before assignment to their first operational assignment.

Restricted Line officers, depending on designator, may train, qualify and be assigned as naval intelligence officers, naval cryptographic officers, aircraft maintenance duty officers, meteorologists/oceanographers, information professionals, human resources professionals, public affairs officers, or a host of other specialties.

Still others may become staff corps officers in the Supply Corps, Civil Engineering Corps, Nurse Corps, Medical Service Corps, or be law school students or medical or dental school students in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, Medical Corps or Dental Corps, respectively.

===Coast Guard===
While the Coast Guard does not categorize its officers as unrestricted line, restricted line or staff corps, a similar career sorting and training process also takes place, ranging from those in operational fields such as cuttermen aboard Coast Guard cutters, Naval Aviators in Coast Guard Aviation, specialists in maritime safety and inspections, and a host of other Coast Guard officer career fields.
All ensigns will become branch officers or division officers in their first operational assignments, responsible for leading a group of petty officers and enlisted men in one of the ship&#x27;s, squadrons, team&#x27;s or other organization&#x27;s branches and divisions (for example, engineering, navigation, communications, sensors or weapons aboard a warship, or similar functions in the operations, aircraft maintenance, administrative or safety/NATOPS departments in a flying squadron) while at the same time receiving on-the-job training in leadership, naval systems, programs, and policies from higher-ranking officers and from senior enlisted men and women in the Chief Petty Officer rates.

Navy and Coast Guard ensigns wear collar insignia of a single gold bar and because of this share the nickname &quot;butterbars&quot; with Army, Air Force, Space Force, and Marine Corps second lieutenants, who wear the same insignia.

===Public Health Service Commissioned Corps===
In the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps – a uniformed service in the United States Public Health Service — those wearing the rank of ensign are part of a commissioned officer student training, and extern program (COSTEP), either junior, for those with more than a year remaining of education in a commissionable degree (JRCOSTEP), or senior, for those within one year of graduating with a commissionable degree (SRCOSTEP). Some officers may hold a permanent rank of ensign based on their experience and education, but then can hold the temporary rank of lieutenant, junior grade.

===NOAA Corps===
In the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps) – a uniformed service in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — ensign is the most junior rank. All NOAA Corps officers become ensigns via direct commissions.

<text>François-Xavier-Joseph Droz (; 31 December 1773 – 9 November 1850) was a reactionary French writer on ethics, political science and political economy.

==Biography==

He was born at Besançon, where his family had supplied many notable members of the legal profession. Droz&#x27;s own legal studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived the day after the dethronement of King Louis XVI of France, and was present during the massacres of September. On the declaration of war he joined the volunteer battalion of the Doubs, and for the next three years served in the Army of the Rhine.
Discharged on health grounds, he obtained a much more congenial post in the newly founded école centrale of Besançon; and in 1799 he made his first appearance as an author by an &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;art oratoire&quot; (Paris, Fructidor, An VII.), in which he acknowledges his indebtedness more especially to Hugh Blair.

Moving to Paris in 1803, he became friendly not only with the like-minded Ducis, but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on this philosopher&#x27;s advice that, in order to catch the public ear, he produced the romance of &quot;Lina&quot;, which Sainte-Beuve has characterized as a mingled echo of &quot;Florian&quot; and &quot;Werther&quot;.

Like several other literary men of the time, he obtained a post in the revenue office known as the &quot;Droits runis&quot;; but from 1814 he devoted himself exclusively to literature and became a contributor to various journals. Already favorably known by his &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;art d&#x27;être heureux&quot; (Paris, 1806), his &quot;Éloge de Montaigne&quot; (1812), and his &quot;Essai sur le beau dans les arts&quot; (1815), he not only gained the Montyon Prize in 1823 by his work &quot;De la philosophie morale ou des différents systèmes sur la science de la vie&quot;, but also in 1824 obtained admission to the Académie française.

He died in Paris.

==Thought==

The main doctrine that this treatise seeks to inculcate is that society will never be in a proper state until men have been educated to think of their duties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by &quot;Application de la morale à la politique&quot;, and in 1829 by &quot;L&#x27;économie politique ou principes de la science des richesses&quot;, a methodical and clearly written treatise, which was edited by Michel Chevalier in 1854. His next and greatest work was a &quot;Histoire du règne de Louis XVI&quot; in three volumes (Paris, 1839 1842). As he advanced in life, Droz became more and more decidedly religious, and the last work of his prolific pen was &quot;Pensées sur le christianisme&quot; (1842). In the words of Sainte-Beuve, &quot;he was born and he remained all his life of the race of the good and the just.&quot;

==Legacy==

Joseph Droz is quoted by Peter Kropotkin in his history of the French Revolution, when people were allowed to tour the oubliettes of the royalty, and, according to Joseph Droz, people were horrified at what they saw, and that even given this, &quot;that in the Bastille there were even worse things to be seen.&quot;

<doc id="625549" wikidata="Q565483" url="?curid=625549" title="3325 TARDIS">
<text>3325 TARDIS (provisional designation: ) is a dark Alauda asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 3 May 1984, by American astronomer Brian Skiff at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, in the United States. The asteroid was named TARDIS, after the fictional time machine and spacecraft from the science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

== Orbit and classification ==
TARDIS is a member of the Alauda family (), a large family of typically bright carbonaceous asteroids and named after its parent body, 702 Alauda.

It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 3.1–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,076 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.01 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. In 1958 it was first identified as at the Goethe Link Observatory, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 26 years prior to its official discovery at Anderson Mesa.

== Naming ==
It is named after the acronym TARDIS (&quot;Time And Relative Dimension In Space&quot;), the space and time travel vehicle used by the Doctor in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The fictional time machine looks like a police telephone box from mid-twentieth century Britain. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 March 1990 ().

== Physical characteristics ==
According to the survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and NASA&#x27;s NEOWISE mission, TARDIS measures 28.2 and 29.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo of 0.055 and 0.067, respectively. An albedo between 0.05 and 0.06 is typical for carbonaceous asteroids of the outer main-belt. As of 2016, no rotational lightcurves have been obtained and the asteroid&#x27;s period and shape still remains unknown.

<doc id="625550" wikidata="Q2577992" url="?curid=625550" title="Les Charlots">
<text>Les Charlots, known as The Crazy Boys in the English-speaking world, was a group of French musicians, singers, comedians and film actors, who were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.

The group was active first from 1965 to 1966 as &quot;Les Problèmes&quot;, under which name they made an album with the French singer Antoine. They renamed themselves &quot;Les Charlots&quot; and remained active from 1966 to 1997, then again briefly from 2008 to 2011 (as a duo). &quot;Charlots&quot; is slang for &quot;&quot;clowns&quot; or &quot;idiots&quot;&quot; rather than being a direct reference to Charlie Chaplin, who was generally called Charlot in France.

Their light-hearted comedy style was influenced by the style of popular Italian group Brutos and by the anarchist humor of the Marx Brothers.

The five members were Gérard Rinaldi (vocals, saxophone, accordion), Jean Sarrus (bass, backing vocals), Gérard Filippelli, a.k.a. &quot;Phil&quot; (guitar, backing vocals), Luis Rego (rhythm guitar, piano, backing vocals) and Jean-Guy Fechner (drums, backing vocals). Filippelli was nicknamed &quot;Phil&quot; as there were two &quot;Gérards&quot; in the group.

== Creation of Les Problèmes ==

Rinaldi and Sarrus were musicians in various short-lived groups (&quot;Les Rebelles&quot; and &quot;Les Tarés&quot;, for Sarrus) and they first met in 1963. They became friends and decided to form a rock band, even though at the time, Rinaldi was more into jazz than rock. In 1964, they were joined by Luis Rego, then in 1965 by Gérard Filippelli and Donald Rieubon on drums.

In 1965, they became the backing band for singer Antoine under the name of &quot;Les Problèmes&quot; (&quot;The Problems&quot;) or sometimes &quot;Antoine et les Problèmes&quot; (&quot;Antoine and the Problems&quot;). They backed him on two his greatest hits, &quot;Les Elucubrations d&#x27;Antoine&quot; and &quot;Je Dis ce que je pense, je vis comme je veux&quot;.

In 1965, while he was vacationing in Portugal (his home country), Luis Rego was imprisoned for a few months under the Salazar regime, for desertion and rebellion. During Luis&#x27; incarceration, Rinaldi wrote &quot;Ballade à Luis Rego, Prisonnier Politique&quot; &quot;(&quot;Ballad to Luis Rego, Political Prisoner&quot;),&quot; a popular song that the group often played on stage. He was replaced on stage and in the studio by guitarist Jacques Dautriche (also a singer under the alias &quot;Sullivan&quot;). Rego rejoined the band as soon as he was released.

In 1966, drummer Rieubon was called up for military service and left the band. He was replaced by William Ollivier until the band became &quot;Les Charlots&quot;.

== Success as Les Charlots ==

After a spoof of Antoine&#x27;s &quot;Je Dis ce que je pense, je vis comme je veux&quot; released under the alias &quot;Les Charlots&quot; became a novelty hit, their manager convinced them to stick to comedy and switch names for good. Except for drummer Ollivier who chose to stay with Antoine. He was replaced by Jean-Guy Fechner, brother of the group&#x27;s manager Christian Fechner. For their first tour they hired Dautriche and Ollivier as back-up musicians.
They became instantly extremely popular for their humoristic and parodic songs like &quot;&quot;Si tu ne veux pas payer d&#x27;impôts&quot;,&quot; &quot;Merci Patron&quot;, &quot;&quot;On n&#x27;est Pas là Pour se Faire Engueuler&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Paulette la Reine des Paupiettes&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Berrystock&quot;,&quot; &quot;Sois Erotique&quot; (a parody of Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Je t&#x27;aime Moi Non Plus&quot;), &quot;Je Suis Trop Beau&quot; (a parody of Jacques Dutronc), &quot;Berry Blues&quot;, &quot;&quot;Albert le Contractuel&quot;,&quot;, &quot;Cet été c&#x27;était toi&quot;, &quot;&quot;Ouvre la Fenêtre&quot;, &quot;Pétronille Tu Sens la Menthe&quot;,&quot; &quot;Elle Avait du Poil au Ventre&quot;, &quot;Hey Max&quot; (a parody of Johnny Halliday&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;), &quot;&quot;Elle a Gagné le Yoyo en Bois du Japon (avec la Ficelle du Même Métal)&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Le Trou de Mon Quai&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;La Biguine au Biniou&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Le Chou Farci&quot;,&quot; &quot;Histoire Merveilleuse&quot;, &quot;Chagrin d&#x27;labour&quot;, &quot;&quot;C&#x27;est trop, c&#x27;est trop&quot;, &quot;Ah Viens!&quot;,&quot; &quot;Derrière Chez Moi&quot; and &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Apérobic&quot;.&quot;

Most of the songs were written by Rinaldi, Sarrus or Rego. Rinaldi was the main singer and the four others sang backing vocals.

After they left Antoine, they toured a lot from 1966 to 1970, first as the opening act of prestigious artists like Johnny Hallyday, Françoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan, Claude François and even The Rolling Stones. One day, as The Rolling Stones were late for their gig, Les Charlots started playing &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. Later in the evening, Sarrus said to Mick Jagger that, if they wanted, the Rolling Stones could play &quot;Paulette la Reine des Paupiettes&quot;. Jagger politely refused.

In the late &#x27;60s, Les Charlots began to appear in comedy sketches on French television, most notably in an episode of satirical television cartoon Les Shadoks, with Jean Yanne and popular sitcom Les Saintes Chéries.

In 1968, Rolling Stone magazine named them the best French rock musicians.

In 1969, they recorded a cover album of songs by Boris Vian.

== Film career ==

With their increasing popularity as a genuine rock and comedy group, they received many offers to appear in films. Producer Michel Ardan hired them for their first film &quot;because his children had seen them on television and found them very funny...&quot; Their first film, released in 1970, was &quot;La Grande Java&quot; with comedian Francis Blanche. They played five members of a rugby team whose manager stole the money. The film wasn&#x27;t very good, mostly due to the fact that Les Charlots weren&#x27;t actors and didn&#x27;t get along with director Philippe Clair (often considered to be one of the worst French directors ever). But surprisingly, &quot;La Grande Java&quot; was a hit with teen audiences. On the set, Les Charlots met a first AD named Claude Zidi, who later directed them in their best films.

The following films, &quot;Les Bidasses en folie&quot; (1971), &quot;Les Fous du Stade&quot; (1972), &quot;Les Charlots Font l&#x27;Espagne&quot; (1972), &quot;Le Grand Bazar&quot; (1973), &quot;Les Bidasses s&#x27;en vont en Guerre&quot; (1974) were all superior and very funny comedies. All their films from 1971 to 1976 (8 films) became phenomenal hits in France and all around the world (especially in India) thanks to the fact that (according to Rinaldi) &quot;&quot;you didn&#x27;t need to speak french to understand the plots!&quot;...&quot;

About their films, Les Charlots have often said that their only criteria were the glamorous locations, warm weather and good food. None of them originally intended to become actors and they didn&#x27;t think their movie career would last. They just started out of curiosity, with no ambition to become actors whatsoever. Acting in films was just the icing on the cake. But they had this youthful energy that young people of the time connected to, and after their first film became a hit, they caught the acting bug. Years after their acting debuts with Les Charlots, Gérard Rinaldi and Luis Rego pursued successful solo acting careers outside of the band.

They continued to appear on stage and record albums but movies became their main activity in the &#x27;70s.

Les Charlots wrote and performed the songs and music for most of their films.

The films focused on the group&#x27;s anti-authoritarian lifestyle and free-spirited youthfulness, their friendship, freedom, love of music and pretty girls, their laziness towards work, their numerous blunders and their hatred of authority figures like the army. The films depicted the members in absurd situations and visual gags.

In &quot;Les Bidasses en Folie&quot; (1971) and sequel &quot;Les Bidasses s&#x27;en vont en Guerre&quot; (1974), they played young musicians drafted in the army, trying their best to be sent to the regiment jail rather than taking part in the manoeuvres. Their nemesis was a bald and severe sergeant named Bellec (played by character actor Jacques Seiler) who had to endure his new recruits&#x27; blunders and was ultimately always ridiculed by the boys.

In their biggest hit, &quot;Les Fous du Stade&quot; (1972) they played reluctant athletes in the Olympics.

In &quot;Le Grand Bazar&quot; (1973), they were factory workers, helping their shopkeeper friend Emile (Michel Galabru) fight against a brand new modern supermarket.

In the big budget parody &quot;From Hong Kong with Love&quot; (1975), they reluctantly replaced a recently deceased 007 when Queen Elizabeth II is abducted by villain Mickey Rooney... For the occasion, actors Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell, cameoed in their roles from the 007 franchise as M and Miss Moneypenny respectively.

In &quot;Les Charlots Contre Dracula&quot; (1980), they became vampire hunters.

Rinaldi usually played the straight good-looking guy and the others were his goofy, faithful friends. Supporting actors like Jacques Seiler, Pierre Gualdi, André Badin, Paul Préboist, Roger Carel, Gérard Croce and renowned accordionist Aimable appeared in many of their films. They were directed four times by Claude Zidi who started his directing career with them.

They usually kept their real-life first names (Gérard, Jean, Phil, Luis and Jean-Guy) in the movies, except in the big-budget musketeers parody &#x27; (1974) and sequel &#x27; (1974) in which they played the famous musketeers&#x27; valets, who were revealed to be the true heroes of the classic Alexandre Dumas story.

== Departures of Rego and Fechner ==

At the height of their success, Rego left the band in 1971, just before the release of their second film, Les Bidasses en Folie to focus on a (successful) solo career as an actor. The split was amicable and Rego later rejoined his friends for two movies : Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie (1983) and Le Retour des Charlots (1992). Years later, Rego said he regretted his decision because the following Charlots films were extremely successful. His main reason for leaving was that he felt the scripts for their films or for their sketches on television worked better with a four men team than with five and he sometimes felt a little lost or underappreciated in the middle of the others. He appeared in massive hit Les Bronzés in 1978.

Jean-Guy Fechner left the band in June 1976, a few months after the release of the expensive Bond parody From Hong Kong with Love. Following a dispute about unpaid royalties and disagreements about artistic choices, Les Charlots decided not to renew their contract with producer and manager Christian Fechner (Jean-Guy&#x27;s brother). Les Charlots wanted to star in a satirical film written for them by auteur Bertrand Blier, named &quot;Charlots, Charlottes&quot;, but Christian Fechner bought the rights to the script and threw it in the trash. Jean-Guy was torn between staying in the band or loyalty to his brother. He ultimately left the band.

At the time of the split with Fechner, Les Charlots were supposed to appear alongside comedy legend Louis De Funès in another film by Claude Zidi. The project was to be called &quot;Merci Patron&quot;, after their hit song of the same name. Following their acrimonious split with Christian Fechner, the film was rewritten for emerging comedian Coluche (who had appeared with them in a small part in Le Grand Bazar), renamed L&#x27;Aile ou la Cuisse and became a huge hit, launching Coluche&#x27;s film career.

With no producer and their legal issues with Christian Fechner unresolved, the band went on hiatus until 1978 and the release of their first film as a trio, the mediocre Et Vive la Liberté!

== Les Charlots as a trio ==

Rinaldi, Sarrus and Filippelli went on as a trio from 1976 to 1986, but their five subsequent films, with the lack of a decent producer, lesser budgets, mediocre scripts and directors, were less successful. Only the mediocre Et Vive la Liberté! (1978) and the camp vampire parody Les Charlots Contre Dracula (1980) were minor hits. Les Charlots Contre Dracula is the only film of the band that they wrote themselves. All of their other films as a trio misfired. In 1983, former member Rego joined his former bandmates in a supporting part in Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie, a very bad film that tried to capitalize on their 1971 hit film Les Bidasses en Folie, but where they played different characters.

Years later, Filippelli acknowledged that &quot;if you&#x27;re a fan of Les Charlots, it&#x27;s best that you don&#x27;t watch our last films...&quot;

In 1979, the trio appeared in their first theatre play, &quot;La Cuisine des Anges&quot;, a very successful experience.

In the late seventies and early eighties, the three remaining Charlots focused on new songs and albums, releasing &quot;Fesse en Rut Majeur&quot; (1985), an album composed of dirty lyrics, and also some of their biggest hits : &quot;Chagrin d&#x27;labour&quot;, &quot;La Bouche Camembert&quot; and the very popular &quot;L&#x27;Apérobic&quot;. They still made a lot of television appearances and despite the lesser success of their films, the trio was still very popular.

== Rinaldi&#x27;s departure ==

Two years after the release and lack of success of their 14th film, Charlots Connection (1984), Rinaldi decided to leave the band to focus on his solo acting career in films, TV and on stage. Rinaldi achieved great success with sitcom Marc &amp; Sophie from 1987 to 1991. Sarrus and Rinaldi didn&#x27;t speak to each other for twenty years after Rinaldi left the band. Sarrus and Filipelli were the only two remaining members.

== The Richard Bonnot era : the beginning of the end ==

For Les Charlots, 1986 was the beginning of the end. After a hiatus following Rinaldi&#x27;s departure, he was replaced in 1987 by a friend of Sarrus, small-time singer and comedian Richard Bonnot, who had been the opening act for the band a few times in the early &#x27;80s. In the following years, the three of them recorded a few more songs (including &quot;&quot;Pour pas qu&#x27;l&#x27;amour Capote&quot;,&quot; written for an AIDS awareness campaign) but not enough material to produce a new album. They toured very sporadically in smaller venues with little or no success, playing their old hits. But without Rinaldi&#x27;s immediately recognizable voice (replaced by Bonnot&#x27;s), they almost sounded like a cover band.

In 1988, their old friend Antoine invited Sarrus, Filippelli, Rego and drummer Donald Rieubon to play on his latest album, Antoine Retrouve Les Problèmes (Antoine and The Problems Back Together) and on stage to promote it. It marked the first time that Les Charlots performed under the name &quot;Les Problèmes&quot; since 1966. Rinaldi was also invited but he was filming his hit TV series and couldn&#x27;t appear on the album.

In 1992, the reformed trio (Sarrus, Filippelli and Richard Bonnot) appeared in the group&#x27;s fifteenth and final film, the embarrassing Le Retour des Charlots, reluctantly directed by Sarrus himself because they couldn&#x27;t find another director. Once again, the trio was joined by former member Luis Rego in a supporting part. It was their first film in eight years.

Years later, Filippelli jokingly declared that &quot;that last film with Richard Bonnot was a joke, it was nothing more than an opportunity for us to go on a paid vacation.&quot; (The film was shot in Portugal.) On the poster, Richard Bonnot&#x27;s face was intentionally blurred to create a confusion with the more popular Rinaldi, who wasn&#x27;t in the film. With almost no press and a limited release, Le Retour des Charlots was a critical and box office failure. At that time, Sarrus and Rinaldi were not on speaking terms. Jean-Guy Fechner was asked to appear in the film but a scheduling conflict prevented the reunion. The film was sunk by Rinaldi&#x27;s absence, lame gags and a mediocre script. Now much too old to play young dreamers, burdened with the presence of Richard Bonnot who couldn&#x27;t act or sing to save his life, the band split shortly after that.

Having appeared in the least successful of all their films and barely remembered for his contributions on the last songs, Bonnot is not considered by fans of Les Charlots as a true member of the band. After the group officially split in 1997 (but with almost no noticeable activities between 1992 and 1997), he made a few appearances as a comedian on television but his career remains pretty obscure.

Jean Sarrus and Gérard Filippelli are the only members who appeared in every one of the band&#x27;s 15 films.

Gérard Rinaldi appeared in 14 of them, Jean-Guy Fechner in 9 and Luis Rego in 4.

== Reunions and reformation as a duo ==

The five original members (Rinaldi, Sarrus, Filipelli, Rego and Fechner) reunited on television in Michel Drucker&#x27;s show, Vivement Dimanche in 2009. They spoke at length about their career. It was the first time since Rego&#x27;s departure in 1971, that they got together in the same room.

From 2008 to 2011, at the initiative of Jean Sarrus (who&#x27;s always tried to keep the spirit of the band alive), Rinaldi and Sarrus reunited and toured as Les Charlots, singing medleys of the group&#x27;s biggest hits for the nostalgia tour &quot;&quot;Age Tendre et Têtes de Bois&quot;,&quot; featuring other French artists from the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. On that tour and the album that followed, Rinaldi and Sarrus didn&#x27;t play any instruments, they only sang. They released an album of covers from their hits from the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s named (Les Charlots 2008).

Gérard Rinaldi died of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease on March 2, 2012. He was 69.

== Les Charlots trio ==

Starting in 2013, Jean Sarrus, Jean-Guy Fechner and Richard Bonnot started touring as Les Charlots again in various festivals, but very sporadically. Fechner hadn&#x27;t performed on stage since 1976.

Gérard Filippelli died at the age of 78.

== After Les Charlots ==

* Gérard Rinaldi achieved great success with French sitcom Marc et Sophie, from 1987 to 1991. He continued to appear in films and television (more than 50 TV movies) and dubbed many cartoons for cinema and television, most notably the French version of The Simpsons. He was the French voice of Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum and Mr. Burns. He was also the French voice of various actors like Steve Martin, Ben Kingsley, John Malkovich, Kelsey Grammer, Burt Reynolds, Dustin Hoffman and Pete Postlethwaite. At the time of his death, Rinaldi was working on &quot;&quot;Un P&#x27;tit Air de Crooner&quot;,&quot; a solo album with covers of popular French songs. The album was released posthumously on July 23, 2012. A few days after Rinaldi&#x27;s death, holding back his tears Jean Sarrus paid homage to his friend and had this to say about him : &quot;Gérard was the soul of Les Charlots. He excelled in everything he did : he had this wonderful singing voice, but he saw himself mostly as a writer, that&#x27;s what he liked to do above everything else : writing songs. I admired his great sense of humor and his ability to laugh about everything, all the time. As he was dying, he even made me laugh about his illness. I saw him on his hospital bed a few days before he died, and he just tried to make me laugh in spite of the morphine kicking in. I&#x27;m going to miss him a lot.&quot; Jean-Guy Fechner called him &quot;a most charming and talented man&quot;. Luis Rego also reacted to his friend&#x27;s death, saying that he was very sad and had a lot of admiration for Gérard Rinaldi : &quot;&quot;he was so gifted that he would have had a great career even without the rest of the us&quot;.&quot;
* After a lot of financial problems in the 80s and 90s, Jean Sarrus briefly became a TV host (most notably as the host of a show about country music in the 90&#x27;s), wrote and directed Les Charlots&#x27; last film in 1992 (basically as a late replacement because they found no other director to do it) and published &quot;&quot;100% Charlots&quot;,&quot; a biography of the group in 2007. He appeared in Josiane Balasko&#x27;s Un Grand Cri d&#x27;Amour in 1998 and in a few television films. He reunited with Rinaldi from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, after Rinaldi&#x27;s death, he published a revised version of &quot;100% Charlots&quot; called &quot;Définitivement Charlots&quot;.
* Gérard Filippelli retired from public life in 1997 but was still a musician and a philanthropist. He was working with underprivileged kids, teaching them music. He often jammed with his friend Luis Rego on the weekends. In 2011, at 68, he created and headlined a new rock&#x27;n&#x27; roll band called King Biz. He died on March 30, 2021, aged 78.
* Jean-Guy Fechner never acted again but worked as a publicist for his late brother Christian Fechner, one of France&#x27;s most prominent producer. He worked on the releases of many important films such as Les Bronzés 3 in 2006, supervising trailers, posters and marketing campaigns. He appeared (in cameos only) in films produced by his brother or by his son, Sébastien Fechner who is also a producer and screenwriter. His brother Christian died in 2008. Jean-Guy owns an impressive drums collection.
* Luis Rego is a popular and respected character actor and playwright, appearing in huge hit Les Bronzés in 1978 and with comedian Pierre Desproges in Le Tribunal des Flagrants Délires on television. In 1987, he directed his first and only film, Poule et Frites. After his departure from the group in 1971, he rejoined Les Charlots for two more films in 1983 (Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie) and 1992 (Le Retour des Charlots), in supporting parts. Recently, he appeared in Bertrand Bonello&#x27;s Nocturama (2016).

<text>A land claim is &quot;the pursuit of recognized territorial ownership by a group or individual&quot;. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include aboriginal land claims, Antarctic land claims, and post-colonial land claims.

The term is also sometimes used when referring to disputed territories like Western Sahara or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 

In the colonial times of the United States, American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the de facto conditions:
# claim without any action on the ground
# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground
# claim with the claimant visiting the land
# claim with claimant living on the land.

Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be obtained by making productive use of it.

==Mining claim (United States)==
A mining claim is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the California gold rush of 1849. In the absence of organized government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and to a large extent adopted Mexican mining law. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.

The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of &quot;prior appropriation&quot;, by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use. Other applications of appropriation theory were the Homestead Act, which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.

The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States. The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the Mining Act of 1872. All land in the public domain, that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed. The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California 49ers.

The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the Australian gold rushes which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The Oriental Claims in Victoria are one example of this.

===Staking a claim===
Staking a claim involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a &quot;prudent man&quot; (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.

There are four main types of mining claims: 
# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) 
# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), 
# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) 
# Millsite (a maximum five-acre site for processing ore) 

A mining claim always starts out as an unpatented claim. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A patented claim is one for which the federal government has issued a patent (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.

===Claim jumping===
A dispute when one party (a &quot;claim jumper&quot;) attempts to seize the land on which another party has already made claim is known as &quot;claim jumping&quot;.

<text>Gabriel-Henri Gaillard (26 March 1726 – 13 February 1806) was a French historian.

== Life ==
Gaillard was born in Ostel, Picardy.
He was educated for the bar, but after finishing his studies adopted a literary career, ultimately devoting his chief attention to history. He was already a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and, Belles-lettres (1760), when, after the publication of the three first volumes of his &quot;Histoire de la rivalité de la France et d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;, he was elected to the Académie française (1771); and when Napoleon created the Institute he was admitted into its third class (Académie française) in 1803. For forty years he was the intimate friend of Malesherbes, whose life (1805) he wrote. He died at St Firmin, near Chantilly, on 13 February 1806.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Gaillard is painstaking and impartial in his statement of facts, and his style is correct and elegant, but the unity of his narrative is somewhat destroyed by digressions, and by his method of treating war, politics, civil administration, and ecclesiastical affairs under separate heads.&quot;

His most important work was his &quot;Histoire de la rivalité de la France et de l&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (in 11 vols., 1771–1777); and among his other works may be mentioned:
*&quot;Essai de la rhétorique française à l&#x27;usage des demoiselles&quot; (1745), often reprinted, and in 1822 with a life of the author
*&quot;Histoire de Marie de Bourgogne&quot; (1757)
*&quot;Histoire de François I&quot; (5 vols., 1776–1779)
*&quot;Histoire des grandes querelles entre Charles V. et François II&quot; (2 vols., 1777)
*&quot;Histoire dc Charlemagne&quot; (2 vols., 1782)
*&quot;Histoire de la rivalité de la France et de l&#x27;Espagne&quot; (8 vols., 1801)
*&quot;Dictionnaire historique&quot; (6 vols., 1789–1804), making part of the &quot;Encyclopédie methodique&quot;
*&quot;Mélanges littéraires&quot;, containing éloges on Charles V, Henry IV, Descartes, Corneille, La Fontaine, Malesherbes and others.

<text>Phở or pho (, , ; ) is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (), herbs, and meat – usually beef (), and sometimes chicken (). Phở is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street-stalls, and restaurants country-wide. Residents of the city of Nam Định were the first to create Vietnamese traditional phở. It is considered Vietnam&#x27;s national dish.

Phở is a relatively recent addition to the country&#x27;s cuisine, first appearing in written records in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam, and after the Vietnam War, refugees popularized it throughout the world. Due to limited historical documentation, the origins of phở remain debated. Influences from both French and Chinese culinary traditions are believed to have contributed to its development in Vietnam, as well as to the etymology of its name. The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs and sauce.

In 2017, Vietnam made December 12th the &quot;Day of Pho&quot;.

==History==
Phở likely evolved from similar beef noodle soups found in neighboring countries, including Thailand, and the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Yunnan, where such dishes are common. While rice noodles and spices used in the broth align with Chinese culinary traditions in the north, beef consumption was not widespread among the Vietnamese, who traditionally used buffaloes for farming. The demand for beef increased under French colonial rule, leading some to attribute phở’s origins to French, Chinese, or a combination of both influences. However, its exact origins remain a topic of debate. During French colonial rule (1887–1954), the French introduced pot-au-feu, a slow-cooked beef stew, and the use of beef bones for broth mirrors French consommé techniques. However dishes with a similar preparation to phở using water buffalo meat, such as &quot;xáo trâu&quot; have long been staples to the rural cuisine. Villagers in say they ate phở long before the French colonial period. The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam, southeast of Hanoi in Nam Định Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of phở is reputed to be the villages of and (or ) in Đông Xuân commune, Nam Trực District, Nam Định Province.

Cultural historian and researcher Trịnh Quang Dũng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century. These include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a beef noodle similar to phở called (牛肉粉 or 牛腩粉) or &quot;ngau juk fun&quot;. The Yunnan-style herbal beef soup is called &quot;niupafu&quot; (牛扒呼) or &quot;ngau paa fu&quot; in Cantonese. The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who had an affinity for the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population.

Phở was originally sold as a snack at dawn and dusk by street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying poles (). From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of phở. The heavy was always shouldered by men. They kept their heads warm with distinctive felt hats called .

Hanoi&#x27;s first two fixed phở stands were a Vietnamese-owned Cát Tường on Cầu Gỗ Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of Bờ Hồ tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Quạt Row and Đồng Row. Around 1925, a Vân Cù villager named Vạn opened the first &quot;Nam Định style&quot; pho stand in Hanoi. Peddler declined in number around 1936–1946 in favor of stationary eateries.

===Development===
In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with , sesame oil, tofu, and even &quot;Lethocerus indicus&quot; extract (). This &quot;&quot; failed to enter the mainstream.

, served with cooked beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef was not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time.

With the partition of Vietnam in 1954, over a million people fled North Vietnam for South Vietnam. Phở, which was relatively less consumed in the South, suddenly became popular. No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, mung bean sprouts (), culantro (), cinnamon basil (), Hoisin sauce (), and hot Sriracha sauce () became standard fare. also began to rival fully cooked in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly popularized sandwiches.

Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private phở restaurants were nationalized () and began serving phở noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported potato flour. Officially banned as capitalism, these vendors prized portability, carrying their wares on and setting out plastic stools for customers.

During the so-called subsidy period following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless variety of the dish known as pilotless pho (), in reference to the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s unmanned reconnaissance drones. The broth consisted of boiled water with MSG added for taste, as there were often shortages of various foodstuffs like meat and rice during that period. Bread or cold rice was often served as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping (deep-fried wheat flour dough) in pho.

Pho eateries were privatized as part of Đổi Mới. Many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to evade police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership.

=== Globalization ===
In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought phở to many countries. Restaurants specializing in phở appeared in numerous Asian neighborhoods and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In 1980, the first of hundreds of phở restaurants opened in the Little Saigon in Orange County, California. 

In the United States, phở began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as relations between the U.S. and Vietnam improved. At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country. During the 2000s, phở restaurants in the United States generated US$500  million in annual revenue, according to an unofficial estimate. Phở can now be found in cafeterias at many college and corporate campuses, especially on the West Coast.

The word &quot;pho&quot; was added to the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2007. is listed at number 28 on &quot;World&#x27;s 50 Most Delicious Foods,&quot; compiled by &quot;CNN Go&quot; in 2011. The Vietnamese Embassy in Mexico celebrated Phở Day on April 3, 2016, with Osaka Prefecture holding a similar commemoration the following day. Phở has been adopted by other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Lao and Hmong cuisine. It sometimes appears as &quot;Phô&quot; on menus in Australia.

=== Modern Era ===
In recent decades, phở has evolved beyond its traditional form, with new variations emerging to cater to modern tastes and preferences. One notable innovation is phở cuốn, where the ingredients of phở are wrapped in fresh rice noodles, creating a new dish that has gained popularity in Hanoi.

Phở&#x27;s influence has even extended into the cocktail scene, with bars like Nê offering phở-inspired cocktails that incorporate the soup’s signature spices.

Additionally, chefs such as Peter Cung have brought phở into the realm of fine dining, as exemplified by his Michelin-starred restaurant Anan Saigon, where phở is deconstructed into a multi-course meal.

Official recognition has followed suit, with the Vietnamese government designating December 12 as the &#x27;Day of Phở&#x27; in 2018, and in 2024, Hanoi and Nam Định-style phở were recognized as national intangible cultural heritage. These developments reflect the dish’s enduring relevance and its continued reinvention in both local and international culinary landscapes.

==Etymology and origins==
Reviews of 19th and 20th-century Vietnamese literature have found that pho entered the mainstream sometime in the 1910s. Georges Dumoutier&#x27;s extensive 1907 account of Vietnamese cuisine omits any mention of phở. The word appears in a short story published in 1907. Nguyễn Công Hoan recalls its sale by street vendors in 1913. A 1931 dictionary is the first to define as a soup: &quot;from the word . A dish consisting of small slices of rice cake boiled with beef.&quot;

Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book &quot;Recipes of All Nations&quot;, edited by Countess Morphy in 1935: In the book, pho is described as &quot;an Annamese soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of &quot;nuoc-mam&quot; (fish sauce)&quot;.&quot;&quot;

There are two prevailing theories on the origin of the word and, by extension, the dish itself. As author Nguyễn Dư notes, both questions are significant to Vietnamese identity.

===From French===

Some historians suggest a connection to the French due to the introduction of beef as a staple ingredient during French colonial rule. French settlers commonly ate beef, whereas Vietnamese traditionally ate pork and chicken and used cattle primarily as beasts of burden. Gustave Hue (1937) equates to the French beef stew (literally, &quot;pot on the fire&quot;). Accordingly, Western sources generally maintain that is derived from in both name and substance. However, several scholars dispute this etymology, pointing to the significant differences between the two dishes. Another suggestion of a separate origin is that phở in French has long been pronounced rather than : in Jean Tardieu&#x27;s &quot;Lettre de Hanoï à Roger Martin Du Gard&quot; (1928), a soup vendor cries &quot;Pho-ô!&quot; in the street.

Many Hanoians explain that the word derives from French soldiers&#x27; ordering &quot;&quot; (fire) from , referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of phở and the wood fire seen glowing from a in the evening.

Food historian Erica J. Peters argues that the French has embraced phở in a way that overlooks its origins as a local improvisation, reinforcing &quot;an idea that the French brought modern ingenuity to a traditionalist Vietnam&quot;. The connection between phở and the French culinary tradition remains widely debated but remains a prominent theory in discussions of its origins.

===From Cantonese===

Another possible origin links phở to Chinese influences. Hue and Eugène Gouin (1957) suggest that phở may be a shortened form of lục phở and that it is derived from ngưu nhục phấn (Chinese: 牛肉粉; Cantonese Yale: ngau4 yuk6 fan2), which means &quot;beef noodles.&quot; This dish was sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi. This etymology is supported by the 1931 dictionary definition of phở and the influence of Chinese culinary traditions, including the use of rice noodles and spices in the broth. ( is an allophone of in some northern dialects of Vietnamese.)

Some scholars argue that phở (the dish) evolved from , a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the Red River, it consisted of stir-fried strips of water buffalo meat served in broth atop rice vermicelli. Around 1908–1909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up to serve them but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef set aside by butchers who sold to the French. Chinese vendors advertised this by crying out, &quot;Beef and noodles!&quot; (). Eventually, the street cry became &quot;Meat and noodles!&quot; (), with the last syllable elongated. Nguyễn Ngọc Bích suggests that the final &quot;n&quot; was eventually dropped because of the similar-sounding (). The French author Jean Marquet refers to the dish as &quot;!&quot; in his 1919 novel &quot;Du village-à-la cité&quot;. This is likely what the Vietnamese poet Tản Đà calls &quot; in &quot; (&quot;Gambling&quot;), written around 1915–1917.

&quot;Phở&quot; uses a common variety of Chinese rice noodle called &quot;ho fun&quot;, () which is believed to have originated in the town of Shahe (Chinese: 沙河; pinyin: Shāhé; Jyutping: Sa1ho4*2), now part of the Tianhe District of Guangzhou in Guangdong province, southern China. The Cantonese also use the word () as well as () to describe &quot;Phở&quot;. The Chinese character 粉 (pinyin: fěn) is pronounced similarly to the Vietnamese &#x27;phở&#x27;. The two words share a close phonetic resemblance and could be cognates, influenced by regional and dialectical pronunciation variations.

==Ingredients and preparation==
Phở is served in a bowl with a specific cut of flat rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature slow-cooked tendons, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard.

When eating at phở stalls in Vietnam, customers are generally asked which parts of the beef they would like and how they want it done.

Beef parts include:
*Tái băm: Rare beef patty, beef is minced by a chopping knife right before serving 
*Tái: Medium rare meat
*Tái sống: Rare meat
*Tái chín: Mixture of medium rare meat and pre-cooked well-done meat, the default serving in most pho restaurants
*Tái lăn: Meat is sauteed before adding to the soup 
*Tái nạm: Mix of medium rare meat with flank
*Nạm: Flank cut
*Nạm gầu: Brisket
*Gân: Tendons
*Sách: Beef tripe
*Tiết: Boiled beef blood
*Bò viên: Beef ball 
*Trứng tái: Poached chicken egg (served in a separate bowl)

For chicken phở, options might include:
*Đùi gà: Chicken thigh
*Lườn gà: Chicken breast
*Lòng gà: Chicken innards
*Trứng non: Immature chicken eggs
*Trứng chần: chicken egg yolk

===Noodles===
The freshly made rice noodles which are usually used are called , or for short, in Vietnamese, while the dried rice noodles are called , or for short, . In North America, the semi dried pho noodles are labeled on the packaging as (fresh pho noodles).
Pho noodles are usually medium-wide; however, people from different regions of Vietnam will prefer different widths.

===Broth===

The soup for beef phở is generally made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger, and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may be used usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken phở, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted since its function in beef phở is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.

The spices, often wrapped in cheesecloth or a soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.

Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor. They also skim off all the impurities that float to the top while cooking; this is the key to a clear broth. (fish sauce) is added toward the end.

===Garnishes===
Different regions have different ways of eating pho that suit their taste and practice. The Northern pho is typically served with scallions, onions, and cilantro (coriander leaves). The Southern variant also adds Thai basil and bean sprouts. Thai chili peppers, lime wedges, fish sauce, chili oil, hot chili sauce (such as Sriracha sauce), pickled garlic (Northern style), or hoisin sauce (Southern style) may be added to taste as accompaniments. The Central pho is more special. On the table, they prepare pickled papaya, and sate sauce.

Several ingredients not generally served with phở may be ordered by request. Extra-fatty broth (&quot;nước béo&quot;) can be ordered and comes with scallions to sweeten it. A popular side dish ordered upon request is &quot;hành dấm&quot;, or vinegared white onions.

==Styles of pho==
===Regional variants===
The several regional variants of pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between &quot;Northern phở&quot; (&#x27;) or &quot;Hanoi phở&quot; (phở Hà Nội), and &quot;Southern phở&quot; (phở Nam) or &quot;Saigon pho&quot; (&#x27;). Northern Vietnamese phở uses a savoury, clear broth, blanched whole green onion, and garnishes offered generally include only diced green onion and cilantro, pickled garlic, chili sauce and &quot;quẩy&quot;. The Northern pho is often described as subtle and light on spices while having a deep savory taste from beef bones. On the other hand, southern Vietnamese phở broth is sweeter and cloudier, and is consumed with bean sprouts, fresh sliced chili, hoisin sauce, and a greater variety of fresh herbs. Phở may be served with either phở noodles or kuy teav noodles (). The variations in meat, broth, and additional garnishes such as lime, bean sprouts, &quot;ngò gai&quot; (culantro), &quot;húng quế&quot; (Thai basil), and &quot;tương đen&quot; (hoisin sauce), &quot;tương ớt&quot; (chili sauce) appear to be innovations made by or introduced to the South. Another style of northern phở is phở Nam Định from Nam Định city which uses more fish sauce in the broth and wider noodles. Other provincial variations exist where pho is served with delicacy meats other than beef or chicken, such as duck, buffalo, goat, or veal.

===Outside Vietnam===
After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, the Philippines welcomed refugees into its territories, resulting in thousands of Vietnamese from southern Vietnam taking shelter on the Filipino island of Palawan. The Vietnamese immigrants brought with them part of their culture which influenced the Filipinos of the island, and vice versa. A notable culinary legacy is a pho-like Filipino dish popular in Palawan island that locals call chao long (not to be confused with the Vietnamese porridge called &quot;chao long&quot;). The Filipino &quot;chao long&quot; is a noodle dish, which is a combination of broth, protein (beef, pork, and/or chicken), rice noodles, mung bean sprouts, and basil leaves. It is accompanied by a Filipino citrus called &quot;calamansi&quot; and served with a bread similar to Vietnamese bánh mì, which the locals refer to as &quot;French bread&quot;.

==Notable restaurants==

Famous phở shops in Hanoi are Phở Bát Đàn, Phở Thìn Bờ Hồ, Phở Thìn Lò Đúc, Phở 10 Lý Quốc Sư. In 2016, BBC noted Pho 10 Ly Quoc Su to be among the best pho addresses in Vietnam. Phở Thìn Lò Đúc has also opened foreign branches in Australia, Japan and the U.S.

Famous phở shops in Saigon included , , , , and . Pasteur Street () was a street famous for its beef phở, while Hien Vuong Street () was known for its chicken phở. At Phở Bình, American soldiers dined as National Liberation Front agents planned the Tết Offensive just upstairs. Nowadays in Ho Chi Minh City, well-known restaurants include: Phở Hùng, Phở Hòa Pasteur, and Phở 2000, which U.S. President Bill Clinton visited in 2000.

One of the largest phở chains in Vietnam is Pho 24, a subsidiary of Highlands Coffee, with 60 locations in Vietnam and 20 abroad. 

===In the U.S.===
The largest phở chain in the United States is Phở Hòa, which operates over 70 locations in seven countries. A similar restaurant named Pho 75 serves in the Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, areas in the United States. Numbers in the restaurant name are &quot;lucky&quot; numbers for the owners: culturally lucky numbers or to mark a date in Vietnam or their personal history.

Many phở restaurants in the United States offer oversized helpings with names such as &quot;train phở&quot; (), &quot;airplane phở&quot; (), or &quot;California phở&quot; (). Some restaurants have offered a phở eating challenge, with prizes for finishing as much as of phở in one sitting, or have auctioned special versions costing $5,000.

<doc id="625566" wikidata="Q16574914" url="?curid=625566" title="Hey Sandy">
<text>&quot;Hey Sandy&quot; is a song by the American indie rock band Polaris which serves as the theme song for the Nickelodeon television show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;. It&#x27;s well-known by fans of the show and the band alike that the song&#x27;s lyrics, nearly indecipherable, have generated considerable debate as to their meaning.

==Missing lyric==
The full lyrics were a subject of speculation for several years until they were revealed to fans by band members and cast members of the show. One line, the third and the most difficult one to understand, was purposefully left a mystery by head songwriter Mark Mulcahy. The most common assumptions are &quot;Can you settle to shoot me?&quot; and &quot;Can you settle a sure bet?&quot;, with actor Danny Tamberelli backing up the second one. Another theory indicates that it could be a reference to the Kent State shootings and Sandra Lee Scheuer (being the diminutive &quot;Sandy&quot; of the song), although the actual meaning of the song is in debate. In regards to this, Mulcahy said in 2015: &quot;No one is right. Nothing that anyone has guessed is right (...) But, you know, eventually no one&#x27;s going to care so. I don&#x27;t know if I want to take it to my grave. Maybe I do.&quot; Incorrect translations of this lyric, however, can still be found on the closed captioning of Pete and Pete DVD sets.

==Additions==
The full album version of &quot;Hey Sandy&quot; begins with a sample of actor Sorrell Booke performing a section of the 1969 documentary album &quot;To The Moon: A Time-Life Records Presentation&quot;.

:&quot;Jupiter, or Thor, is perfect. We need Atlas for our long-distance stuff. The Titan will be even better. They shouldn&#x27;t have canceled Navaho. Wait &#x27;til you see our submarines with Polaris.&quot;

Besides a reference to the band&#x27;s name, the sample discusses United States ballistic missiles designed during the Cold War:
* the intermediate-range Jupiter and Thor IRBM
* the Atlas ICBM, the first successful US intercontinental ballistic missile (for &quot;long-distance stuff&quot;)
* the Titan family of ICBMs, successors of Atlas
* the cancelled SM-64 Navaho, an experimental cruise missile developed by the U. S. Air Force
* the UGM-27 Polaris, a submarine-launched ballistic missile

Brooke&#x27;s performance is abruptly cut off and followed by another sample from &quot;To The Moon&quot; of a radio transmission from the pre-launch testing of Apollo 11:

:&quot;Attention all personnel, this is CVTS. Base vehicle pre-count operations will start on my mark in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...&quot;

There is a cover version of &quot;Hey Sandy&quot; by the New Jersey band Mister Behavior, as well as by California math rock band Tera Melos on their covers EP Idioms, Vol. I

<text>Curve is a global lesbian media project. It covers news, politics, social issues, and includes celebrity interviews and stories on entertainment, pop culture, style, and travel.

==History and profile==
Founded by Frances &quot;Franco&quot; Stevens in San Francisco in 1990. While working at A Different Light Bookstore she noticed that bookstores and newsstands had few lesbian publications to offer, so she decided to do something about it. &quot;Curve&quot; was first published as &quot;Deneuve&quot; magazine. To fund the publication, Stevens applied for numerous credit cards, then took the borrowed money to the race track, winning enough money to cover the first three issues. The lifestyle magazine reported on the lesbian scene, fashion, fiction, music and film, and rumors from the lesbian community. The first issue of &quot;Deneuve&quot; hit the newsstands with Katie Sanborn as managing editor and sold out in six days.

Stevens caused controversy by &quot;putting the word lesbian on the front cover because that meant every time somebody wanted to buy it, they were essentially coming out to anyone standing around them, anyone who saw it in their house.&quot; Over time, the magazine secured mainstream advertising deals, and famous faces like tennis player Martina Navratilova and singer Melissa Etheridge posed for the cover.

The magazine was rebranded as &quot;Curve&quot; in 1996 after a trademark dispute with French actress Catherine Deneuve. DJ Page Hodel hosted the &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot; legal aid benefit to help the magazine overcome the financial impact of the lawsuit.

&quot;Curve&quot; has been considered a perennial leader in reporting on a range of cultural issues, often writing about topics that were then picked up by mainstream media. Before the marriage equality movement picked up steam, &quot;Curve&quot; published an article about negotiating partner benefits in the workplace, in the December 1993 issue. &quot;Curve&quot; wrote about cybersex in 1995. In 2003, &quot;Curve&quot; was early in reporting on pregnancies within the queer community. &quot;Curve&quot; had a feature on gender queer fashion in Brooklyn, titled &quot;Tomboys Rule Brooklyn&quot; in the September 1996 issue. In 1999, &quot;Curve&quot; launched a website with online subscriptions, videos, books, and discussion boards.

Diane Anderson-Minshall was editor-in-chief when the magazine was acquired in October 2010 by Australian media company, Avalon Media. Under the ownership of Avalon Media, &quot;Curve&quot; was headquartered in Sydney with Merryn Johns as editor-in-chief and reported its circulation at 52,237, and a 182,831 readership with a median household income of $85,372. Founded by Silke Bader, Avalon Media also published &quot;Lesbians on the Loose&quot; (LOTL) and &quot;Bound&quot; magazines in Australia.

In 2021, &quot;Curve&quot; magazine was re-acquired by Founder Franco Stevens and donated to The Curve Foundation, with its mission to &quot;empower lesbian, queer women, trans women, and non-binary people to share culture and stories, connect with each other, and raise visibility.&quot;

&quot;Curve&quot; was featured on the Showtime television series &quot;The L Word&quot; when a fictional writer for the magazine interviews Jenny Schecter, one of the characters, was interviewed about her book. 

== Ahead of the Curve ==
&quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; is a feature documentary film that tells the story of the founder of &quot;Curve&quot; magazine, the magazine&#x27;s rise to fame and its aspirations for the future of lesbian and queer media. The film is co-produced and co-directed by Jen Rainin and Rivkah Beth Medow, with music composed by Meshell Ndegeocello.

&quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; premiered at Frameline, the San Francisco international LGBTQ+ film festival, in 2020 and received the Grand Prix du Jury at the Image+Nation Film Festival. The film also received Audience Awards for Best Documentary at aGLIFF, , Tampa International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the Connecticut LGBT Film Festival.

&quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; was released in theaters, digital platforms and DVD on June 1, 2021.

==Controversy==
In a 2000 interview with &quot;Curve&quot;, Sinead O&#x27;Connor commented, &quot;I&#x27;m a dyke… although I haven&#x27;t been very open about that and throughout most of my life I&#x27;ve gone out with blokes because I haven&#x27;t necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule. But I actually am a dyke.&quot; However, soon after in an interview in The Independent, she stated, &quot;I believe it was overcompensating of me to declare myself a lesbian. It was not a publicity stunt. I was trying to make someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description.&quot;

In May 2007, actress Michelle Rodriguez criticized &quot;Curve&quot; and accused its editors of attempting to &quot;out&quot; her. Rodriguez stated, &quot;As far as rumors go of me coming out, I guess &quot;Curve&quot; magazine took it upon themselves to out me on the premise of their own suspicions... to put words in someone&#x27;s mouth and place people in categories affects them for sure, especially in this business.&quot; Her comments ended up angering many in the gay community and some even accused her of being homophobic. Rodriguez has denied those claims as well.

In the July/August 2007 issue of &quot;Curve&quot;, editors responded to this criticism by stating: &quot;If you read the article, you will see that the author did not, in fact, &#x27;out&#x27; Rodriguez; rather, the article stated both that &quot;Rodriguez has never publicly come out&quot; and &quot;Rodriguez has said she is not a lesbian.&quot;

== The Curve Foundation ==
Launched in 2021, The Curve Foundation amplifies the voices of LGBTQ+ women and non-binary people, creating a searchable archive from the 30 years of magazine issues, and supporting journalists in the tradition of Curve magazine.

Franco Stevens&#x27;s path to launching The Curve Foundation is documented in the 2021 film &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot;.

<doc id="625568" wikidata="Q1259275" url="?curid=625568" title="Third Treaty of San Ildefonso">
<text>The Third Treaty of San Ildefonso was a secret agreement signed on 1 October 1800 between Spain and the French Republic by which Spain agreed in principle to exchange its North American colony of Louisiana for territories in Tuscany. The terms were later confirmed by the March 1801 Treaty of Aranjuez.

==Background==
For much of the 18th century, France and Spain were allies, but after the execution of Louis XVI in 1793, Spain joined the War of the First Coalition against the French Republic but was defeated in the War of the Pyrenees. In August 1795, Spain and France agreed to the Peace of Basel, with Spain ceding its half of the island of Hispaniola, the modern Dominican Republic.

In the 1796 Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain allied with France in the War of the Second Coalition and declared war on Britain. This resulted in the loss of Trinidad and, more seriously, Menorca, which Britain occupied from 1708 to 1782 and whose recovery was the major achievement of Spain&#x27;s participation in the 1778–1783 Anglo-French War. Its loss damaged the prestige of the Spanish government, while the British naval blockade severely impacted the economy, which was highly dependent on trade with its colonies in the Americas, particularly the import of silver from Mexico.

The effect was to place the Spanish government under severe political and financial pressure, the national debt increasing eightfold between 1793 and 1798. Louisiana was only part of Spain&#x27;s immense empire in the Americas, which it received as a result of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, when France ceded it as compensation for Spanish concessions to Britain elsewhere. Preventing encroachment by American settlers into the Mississippi Basin was costly and risked conflict with the U.S., whose merchant ships Spain relied on to evade the British blockade.

Colonies were viewed as valuable assets; the loss of the sugar-producing colonies of Haiti (Saint-Domingue), Martinique, and Guadeloupe between 1791 and 1794 had a huge impact on French business. Restoring them was a priority, and when Napoleon seized power in the November 1799 Coup of 18 Brumaire, he and his deputy Charles Talleyrand stressed the need for French expansion overseas.

Their strategy had a number of parts, one being the 1798–1801 Egyptian campaign, intended in part to strengthen French trading interests in the region. In South America, Talleyrand sought to move the border between French Guiana and Portuguese Brazil south to the Araguari or Amapá River, taking in large parts of Northern Brazil. Terms were contained in the draft 1797 Treaty of Paris which was never approved although similar conditions were imposed on Portugal in the 1801 Treaty of Madrid. A third was the restoration of New France in North America, lost after the 1756–1763 Seven Years&#x27; War, with Louisiana providing raw materials for French plantations in the Caribbean.

The combination of French ambition and Spanish weakness made the return of Louisiana attractive to both, especially as Spain was being drawn into disputes with the U.S. over navigation rights on the Mississippi River. Talleyrand claimed French possession of Louisiana would allow them to protect Spanish South America from both Britain and the U.S.

==Provisions==
The Treaty was negotiated by French general Louis-Alexandre Berthier and the Spanish former Chief Minister Mariano Luis de Urquijo. In addition to Louisiana, Berthier was instructed to demand the Spanish colonies of East Florida and West Florida, plus ten Spanish warships.

Urquijo rejected the request for the Floridas but agreed to Louisiana plus &quot;...six ships of war in good condition built for seventy-four guns, armed and equipped and ready to receive French crews and supplies.&quot; The six ships of the line supplied to the French were &quot;San Antonio&quot;, &quot;Intrepido&quot;, &quot;San Genaro&quot;, &quot;Atlante&quot;, &quot;Conquistador&quot; and &quot;Infante Don Pelayo&quot;; &quot;San Genaro&quot; and &quot;Atlante&quot; were older ships, but the other four were modern ships of the &quot;San Ildefonso&quot; class. In return, Charles IV wanted compensation for his son-in-law Louis, Infanta Duke of Parma, since France wanted to annex his inheritance of the Duchy of Parma.

Geographical details were vague, Clause II of the Treaty simply stating &quot;it may consist of Tuscany...or the three Roman legations or of any other continental provinces of Italy which form a rounded state.&quot; Urquijo insisted Spain would hand over Louisiana and the ships only once France confirmed which Italian territories it would receive in return. Finally, the terms reaffirmed the alliance between France and Spain agreed upon in the 1796 Second Treaty of San Ildefonso.

==Aftermath==
On 9 February 1801, France and the Austrian Emperor Francis II signed the Treaty of Lunéville, clearing the way for the Treaty of Aranjuez in March 1801. This confirmed the preliminary terms agreed at Ildefonso and created the short-lived Kingdom of Etruria for Maria Luisa&#x27;s son-in-law Louis. Spain&#x27;s Chief Minister Manuel Godoy was excoriated for the terms, which were seen as excessively benefiting France; he later justified it at length in his Memoirs. Modern historians are less critical, since Spain exercised effective control only over a small part of the territory included in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase while an attempt to control U.S. expansion into Spanish territories by the 1795 Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty proved ineffective.

From 1798 to 1800, France and the U.S. waged an undeclared war at sea, the so-called Quasi-War, which was ended by the Convention of 1800 or Treaty of Mortefontaine. With an already hostile British Canada to the north, the U.S. wanted to avoid an aggressive and powerful France replacing Spain in the south. For commercial reasons, Napoleon wanted to reestablish France&#x27;s presence in North America, the November 1801 Saint-Domingue expedition being the first step. The March 1802 Treaty of Amiens ended the War of the Second Coalition and in October, Spain transferred Louisiana to France.

While the presence of 30,000 French troops and sailors in the Caribbean initially caused great concern in the U.S., by October 1802 it was clear the expedition was a catastrophic failure; its leader, General Charles Leclerc died of yellow fever, along with an estimated 29,000 men by mid-summer. Without Saint-Domingue, Napoleon concluded Louisiana was irrelevant, and with France and Britain once again on the verge of hostilities, he decided to sell the territory to prevent it from being annexed by British forces garrisoned in nearby Canada. In April 1803, the U.S. purchased the territory for $15 million, or 80 million francs.

The elaborate shuffling of Italian territories was ultimately futile. Etruria was dissolved and incorporated into France in 1807, while much of pre-Napoleonic Italy was restored by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, including the Grand Duchies of Tuscany and Parma.

<text>Constantin Brunner (1862–1937) was the pen-name of the German Jewish philosopher Arjeh Yehuda Wertheimer (called Leo). He was born in Altona (near Hamburg) on 27 August 1862. He came from a prominent Jewish family that had lived in the vicinity of Hamburg for generations; his grandfather, Akiba Wertheimer, was chief Rabbi of Altona and Schleswig-Holstein. Brunner studied philosophy under a number of prominent scholars, but never completed his doctorate. He established himself as a literary critic, and enjoyed a wide celebrity. In the 1890s, he withdrew from public life to devote himself to writing. He lived in Germany until 1933, when, with the rise to power of the Nazi party, he moved to The Hague, where he died on 27 August 1937.

==Doctrine==

Central to Brunner&#x27;s theory is the characterization of three different modes of mental activity:

# Practical reason, which every human possesses, and which serves one&#x27;s normal needs
# Spiritual/intellectual (&quot;geistig&quot;) thought, which rises above the relative truth residing in experience and in science, and strives toward a perception of the one eternal and absolute essence.
# &quot;Superstition&quot;—pseudo-contemplation, which is the mode of contemplation of most ordinary men. Unfounded belief is a distortion of the spiritual faculty. While practical reason recognizes that the &quot;relative&quot; is only &quot;relative,&quot; superstition elevates what is relative to the status of the absolute.

Each of the three modes of thought consists of three specific aspects. In the practical understanding, the aspects are feeling, knowing and willing. In spiritual life, these are modified to become art, philosophy and mysticism (love). Superstition, however, distorts these aspects of spiritual life, transforming them into religion, metaphysics and moralism.

Brunner&#x27;s intention is to contrast popular thought with spiritual/intellectual thought. His work &quot;Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke&quot; is a survey of the whole of human intellectual history seen from the point of view of this doctrine.

Brunner&#x27;s ultimate objective was to prepare the way for the establishment of a community centered on the life of the mind, which would in turn open the way to the expansion of democracy.

==Brunner and Judaism==

The opposition between the spiritual and the religious is a major theme in Brunner&#x27;s work. He contends that Judaism is essentially anti-religious, stating in &quot;Our Christ&quot; that &quot;Judaism as a spiritual doctrine is the opposite of religion and a protest against it&quot;, and culminates his argument with his own translation of the Shema: &quot;Hear O Israel, Being is our god, Being is one&quot;. He juxtaposes priestly/pharisaic/rabbinic to prophetic Judaism, stating that the latter represents the true mystical essence in opposition to the former which distorts that essence.

==Brunner and Christianity==

For Brunner, Jesus was both a mystic and a genius, whereas Christian religion is largely a distortion of his thought. 

==Brunner and Israel==

Throughout his life, Brunner was anti-Zionist. However, there is evidence that, toward the end of his life in light of events in Europe, he was reconsidering his opposition to the founding of the state of Israel (see &quot;Assimilation und Nationalismus: ein Briefwechsel mit Constantin Brunner&quot; / Willy Aron).

==Brunner and the history of philosophy==

According to Brunner, the authentic philosophy presented by Spinoza has its antithesis in scholasticism which reaches its highest expression in Immanuel Kant. Thus Spinoza and Kant represent opposite poles in the dialectical idealism by which Brunner organizes the whole of intellectual history.

==Brunner and science==

Brunner maintains that the foundation of all science is the doctrine of universal all-motion. His elaboration of this doctrine has had a decisive effect on a number of medical practitioners and researchers.

==Brunner and evolution==

Brunner&#x27;s position is that the fixity of the genus is a scientific principle that needs to be preserved if meaningful work is to be undertaken with biological systems. He argued that because the theory of evolution undermined the notion of genus, it would be detrimental to practical scientific endeavor.

==Influence and relevance==

In &quot;Confessions of a European Intellectual&quot;, Franz Schoenberner describes Brunner as &quot;one of the more important figures&quot; in Europe. Brunner corresponded with Walther Rathenau, Martin Buber, Gustav Landauer and Lou Andreas-Salomé. Albert Einstein read Brunner but, while appreciating his critical insight and sharing his devotion to Spinoza, rejected his philosophy, particularly where it stood opposed to Immanuel Kant.

Brunner attracted a large and devoted following among the Jewish youth in Czernowitz. The best known of his disciples in this group is the poet, Rose Ausländer.

With the Second World War, Brunner&#x27;s books were burned and his devotees scattered. His German disciple Magdalena Kasch managed to save the bulk of Brunner&#x27;s writing from destruction by the Nazis. In 1948, she, with the help of some of Brunner&#x27;s other surviving friends, founded the &quot;Internationaal Constantin Brunner Institut&quot; (ICBI) in the Hague. However, there has been no major revival of interest in his work, despite the efforts of artists Yehudi Menuhin and André Breton who regarded him as a role model.

==Brunner in English==

Brunner&#x27;s works available in English include

*&quot;Science, Spirit, Superstition&quot;, which is a compilation of material from his other books. There are extracts from many of Brunner&#x27;s works, including large sections from &quot;Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volk&quot;, covering the doctrine and history of science. There are also important sections from &quot;Materialismus und Idealismus&quot;, a dialogue presentation of Brunner&#x27;s understanding of philosophy and its history. It includes his writing on a variety of subjects.
*&quot;Our Christ&quot;. A translation, with an introduction and editorial notes.
*&quot;The Tyranny of Hate: The Roots of Antisemitism&quot;, an abridgement of one of Brunner&#x27;s works on antisemitism.

There is relatively abundant secondary literature available in English, notably &quot;To live is to think : the thought of twentieth-century German philosopher Constantin Brunner&quot; by Hans Goetz (1995).

==Brunner in French==

Several works by Brunner are available in French. &quot;L&#x27;amour&quot; is the first part of Brunner&#x27;s work on sexual relationships. &quot;Spinoza contre Kant&quot; contains Brunner&#x27;s sketch of the history of modern philosophy. &quot;Le malheur de notre peuple allemand et nos &quot; Völkisch &quot;&quot; (orig. 1924) warns against the dangers of Nazism. The Sorbonne has an archive of several French translations of Brunner&#x27;s work by Henri Lurié. There is abundant secondary material in French as well, notably a recent work by Martin Rodan entitled &quot;Notre culture européenne, cette inconnue&quot; (Peter Lang, 2009).

<doc id="625571" wikidata="Q1666546" url="?curid=625571" title="Roger le Poer">
<text>Roger le Poer was a medieval Lord Chancellor from 1135 until 1139 for King Stephen of England. The son of a powerful bishop, Roger owed his position to his family connections. He lost his office when his father and other relatives lost power. Arrested along with his father, Roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history.

==Background and early life==
Roger was the son of Roger of Salisbury, Lord Chancellor for King Henry I of England and Bishop of Salisbury, and Matilda of Ramsbury. It is possible that Roger of Salisbury was married to Matilda prior to his elevation to the episcopate, but this is unlikely. Because their son Roger le Poer was described as &quot;young&quot; in 1139, it is most likely that he was born after his father&#x27;s consecration as bishop in 1107. A biographer of Roger of Salisbury, Edward Kealey, has argued that Roger le Poer is the same person as Roger, the archdeacon of Berkshire who died in the 1160s. Another possibility, that the younger Roger was the same as Roger of Ramsbury, archdeacon of Wiltshire, is less likely, as it is known that Roger of Ramsbury was not closely related to Adelelm, the nephew or son of Roger of Salisbury. The historian Diana Greenway in the &quot;Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300&quot; takes this view.

==Chancellor==
The younger Roger&#x27;s family was a powerful one in England - not only was his father the Bishop of Salisbury, but he also held the administration of the government in his hands. The older Roger had the powers of the office of justiciar, without having actually been appointed to that office, as a continuation of the power he had held during the second part of the reign of Henry I. The elder Roger&#x27;s two nephews Nigel, who was Bishop of Ely and had previously been Lord Treasurer, and Alexander, who was Bishop of Lincoln - both held important bishoprics, and another nephew or son held the Treasurership from 1136. This was Adelelm, who may have been a full brother to Roger le Poer. The family also controlled a number of castles throughout England. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the younger Roger&#x27;s appointment as chancellor was the price demanded by the elder Roger for the bishop&#x27;s support of Stephen as king after the death of King Henry I. Roger served as chancellor from 1135 until 24 June 1139.

Roger travelled with the king, often accompanying him in the royal progresses around England. In late 1136 or 1137, Roger was with the king at a court called at Westminster which heard a complaint by the Holy Trinity Priory in London that Hasculf de Tany, the castellan of the Tower of London, had taken land that belonged to the priory. In the end, the priory regained custody of their land. In March 1137 Roger was with the king right before the king sailed to Normandy, as the chancellor witnessed a charter of the king just prior to his departure. As chancellor, Roger was a witness on over 60 royal writs.

==Arrest and exile==
In the middle of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen&#x27;s rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours appear to have been started by a group of nobles led by twin brothers Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely. In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger&#x27;s family. This fight was the excuse for the king moving against Roger&#x27;s family. Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger, Matilda&#x27;s own son, if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a high platform in view of the castle with a noose around his neck.

The name &quot;le poer&quot;, or &quot;pauperus&quot;, means &quot;pauper&quot; and was not given to Roger until after his and his father&#x27;s fall from power in 1139. It is possible the new name was bestowed because he could have expected to receive a bishopric after his time as chancellor, which did not happen because of his family&#x27;s disgrace. Another possible reason for the name was to contrast with his father&#x27;s wealth. It is unlikely that he was actually poor, as his family was wealthy and powerful. The historian Francis West described the base of the family&#x27;s power as &quot;control of the important offices of royal government&quot;.

Roger was sent into exile after his family&#x27;s disgrace. If he is the same person as the archdeacon of Berkshire, he died in the middle of the 1160s, but no other sure information is known about him after his exile.

<doc id="625573" wikidata="Q1190060" url="?curid=625573" title="The Jeff Beck Group">
<text>The Jeff Beck Group was a British rock band formed in London in January 1967 by former Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck. Their innovative approach to heavy-sounding blues, rhythm and blues and rock was a major influence on popular music.

== History ==
=== First group ===
The first Jeff Beck Group formed in London in early 1967 and included guitarist Jeff Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart, and rhythm guitarist Ronnie Wood, with bass players and drummers changing regularly. Early bass players were Jet Harris and Dave Ambrose, with Clem Cattini and Viv Prince trying out on drums. The lineup went through months of personnel changes, notably no fewer than four drummers, before settling on Aynsley Dunbar and switching Wood to bass. This lineup spent most of 1967 playing the UK club circuit and appeared several times on BBC Radio. Beck signed a personal management contract with record producer and manager Mickie Most, who had no interest in the group, only in Beck as a solo artist.

During 1967, the band released three singles in Europe and two in the United States, the first, &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;, being the most successful, reaching No. 14 on the UK singles chart; it included the instrumental &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; as the B-side, which had been recorded several months earlier. The lineup for that session included guitarist Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar, John Paul Jones on bass, Keith Moon on drums, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. Frustrated that the band were not playing a strict enough blues set for his taste, drummer Dunbar left and was replaced by Roy Cook for one show, before Stewart recommended Micky Waller, a bandmate of his from Steampacket. Waller went on to play with the band all through 1968 and early 1969, and was their longest-lasting drummer.

Peter Grant, a road manager at the time, had been to the U.S. with the New Vaudeville Band, and was aware of the new concert and album-oriented rock FM radio format developing there. It was now possible to break out a band without using the &quot;hit single&quot; formula. Grant realised that Beck&#x27;s band was ideal for this market and tried several times to buy Beck&#x27;s contract from Most, who refused to let Beck go. By early 1968 the band was considering disbanding, but Grant convinced them not to, and booked a short U.S. tour. Beck said &quot;We were literally down to one change of clothing each&quot;. Grant&#x27;s first stop for them was in New York City, for four shows at Fillmore East, where they played second on the bill to the Grateful Dead. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a Robert Shelton article, &quot;Jeff Beck Group Cheered in Debut&quot;, with the secondary headline &quot;British Pop Singers Delight Fillmore East Audience,&quot; proclaiming that Beck and his group had upstaged the Grateful Dead. The reviews from &quot;The Boston Tea Party&quot; were as good or better: &quot;By the time he got to his last number... (the fans) were in a state of pandemonium the likes of which hadn&#x27;t been witnessed since the Beatles hit town.&quot; By the time they wrapped up the tour at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore West, Peter Grant had secured them a new album contract with Epic Records.
The band quickly returned to England to record the album &quot;Truth&quot; (under the name &quot;Jeff Beck&quot;), which reached No. 15 in the U.S. charts. The tracks were recorded within two weeks, with overdubs added the following month. Mickie Most was busy with other projects at the time and delegated most of the work to Ken Scott, who basically recorded the band playing their live set in the studio. Beck&#x27;s amplifier was apparently so loud, it was recorded from inside a closet. The extra lineup for these sessions included John Paul Jones on Hammond organ, drummer Keith Moon and Nicky Hopkins on piano. The core group, billed as the &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot;, returned to the U.S. for a tour to promote the release of &quot;Truth&quot;. Long-time Beck fan Jimi Hendrix jammed with the band at Cafe Wha? during this and their following tours.

They embarked on their third tour in December 1968 with Hopkins who, although in poor health, decided he wanted to play live. He accepted Beck&#x27;s invitation, even though he had been offered more money by Led Zeppelin. Later, he lamented that &quot;We lost one of the greatest bands in Rock history.&quot; Even with his best intentions, the last leg of the tour was curtailed by illness. Beck then postponed a fourth, February 1969 U.S. tour. This was also because he felt they should not keep playing the same material with nothing new to add. New material was written, Waller was replaced by power drummer Tony Newman and Wood was dismissed, only to be rehired almost immediately. The success of &quot;Truth&quot; ignited new interest from Most and they recorded the album &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; at De Lane Lea Studios, engineered by Martin Birch. They released the single &quot;Plynth&quot; and laid down three Donovan backing tracks as a favour to Most. Two of them were used for his single &quot;Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)&quot;.

In May 1969, the Jeff Beck Group embarked on their fourth U.S. tour, this time with Hopkins as a full-fledged member. The tour went smoothly, &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; was received extremely well, reaching No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, but it was reported that there was now terrible in-fighting within the band. To illustrate, Rod Stewart&#x27;s plans to leave the band may have been under consideration by this time; in July 1969, he brought current bandmate Wood and former bandmate Waller into the studio to record his debut full-length solo album, &quot;An Old Raincoat Won&#x27;t Ever Let You Down&quot;, for Mercury Records.The Jeff Beck Group finished the tour and returned to England, only to return to the States in July 1969 for their fifth and final time. It was a short tour, mostly along the East Coast, including Maryland, their final Fillmore East appearance, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Beck broke up the band on the eve of the Woodstock Music Festival, at which they had been scheduled to perform, believing they were &quot;not ready for that&quot;, later reminiscing that they would be &quot;dated, frozen with that image, with the music not being quite right&quot;. Ronnie Wood has stated he considered it a shame, but Rod Stewart said he was glad they did not attend.

=== Second group ===
In April 1970, Beck reformed the Jeff Beck Group with vocalist Alex Ligertwood, keyboardist Max Middleton, drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman. During June 1971, Beck signed a record deal with CBS and was looking for a new singer. After hearing Bobby Tench perform with his band Gass, &quot;Upstairs&quot; at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s club in Soho, London, Beck employed him as vocalist and second guitarist. Tench was given only a few weeks to learn the new lyrics and add his vocals to the album &quot;Rough and Ready&quot;, before mixing resumed on tracks previously recorded in London by Beck and the other band members. The album was finished in July 1971 and they toured Finland, Holland, Switzerland and Germany. &quot;Rough and Ready&quot; was released in the UK on 25 October 1971, with the U.S. release following during February 1972. A sixteen-day promotional tour in the U.S. followed and the album eventually reached No. 46 in the album charts.
In January 1972, the band travelled to the U.S. to join Beck at TMI studios in Memphis, Tennessee. This is where they recorded the album &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot;, using Steve Cropper as producer. &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot; was released in the UK on 9 June 1972. The promotional tour that followed included an appearance on the BBC Radio 1 &quot;In Concert&quot; series, which was recorded on 29 June 1972. During this session they played &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, which featured Tench playing guitar, a rare occasion while Tench played with Beck.

On 24 July 1972, the Jeff Beck Group was officially disbanded and Beck&#x27;s management put out this statement: &quot;The fusion of musical styles of the various members has been successful, within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn&#x27;t feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought.&quot;

Beck, along with Middleton and later Tench also used the name with Beck, Bogert and Appice.

<text>The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), also known as the U.S. Helsinki Commission, is an independent U.S. government agency created by Congress in 1975 to monitor and encourage compliance with the Helsinki Final Act and other Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) commitments. It was initiated by House representative Millicent Fenwick and established in 1975 pursuant to Public Law No. 94-304 and is based at the Ford House Office Building.

==Function and duties of Commission==
The commission is authorized and directed to monitor the acts of the signatories which reflect compliance with or violation of the articles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, with particular regard to the provisions relating to human rights and Cooperation in Humanitarian Fields. The commission is further authorized and directed to monitor and encourage the development of programs and activities of the United States Government and private organizations with a view toward taking advantage of the provisions of the Final Act to expand east–west economic cooperation and a greater interchange of people and ideas between East and West.

==Abstract==
The Commission consists of nine members from the U.S. House of Representatives, nine members from the United States Senate, and one member each from the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce. The positions of chairman and co-chairman are shared by the House and Senate and rotate every two years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the Commissioners in their work.

The Commission contributes to the formulation of U.S. policy toward the OSCE and the participating states and takes part in its execution, including through Member and staff participation on official U.S. delegations to OSCE meetings and in certain OSCE bodies. Members of the Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government officials, NGOs, and private individuals from other OSCE participating states.

The Commission convenes public hearings and briefings with expert witnesses on OSCE-related issues; issues public reports concerning implementation of OSCE commitments in participating States; publishes a periodic &quot;Digest&quot; with up-to-date information on OSCE developments and Commission activities; and organizes official delegations to participating States and OSCE meetings to address and assess democratic, economic, and human rights developments firsthand.

==History==
In February 2018, the CSCE convened in Washington, DC to address the issue of Russian doping in international sport. Central to the discussion was an exploration of the need to protect whistleblowers. The meeting included testimony from Jim Walden, attorney for Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia&#x27;s anti-doping laboratory who defected to the US.
On 1 July 2022 Ranking Member Sen. Roger Wicker (MS) and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania Bogdan Aurescu co-chaired a conference on Euro-Atlantic security called &quot;BLACK SEA SECURITY SUMMIT&quot;. 

On 17 October 2022, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in full swing, the Commission called for the State Department to submit a motion to the United Nations to end the status of Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. This initiative was seen as a further step in the campaign of Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Sergiy Kyslytsya to unseat Russia.

On 14 December 2022, in a bi-partisan effort, the co-chair of the commission Steve Cohen and the ranking member of the commission Joe Wilson submitted resolution 1517 to the House of Representatives wherein they recapitulated that Russia had committed &quot;flagrant violations&quot; of the U.N. Charter that call into question its right to hold a Security Council seat, and would urge President Biden, inter alia, &quot;to direct the Department of State and other relevant Federal departments and agencies to pursue all appropriate steps with Allies, partners, and other countries to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation or membership of the Russian Federation in other organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations&quot;.

<doc id="625580" wikidata="Q2117942" url="?curid=625580" title="Siegfried Idyll">
<text>The , WWV 103, by Richard Wagner is a symphonic poem for chamber orchestra.

==Background==
Wagner composed the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; as a birthday present to his second wife, Cosima, after the birth of their son Siegfried in 1869. It was first performed on Christmas morning, 25 December 1870, by a small ensemble of the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich on the stairs of their villa at Tribschen (today part of Lucerne), Switzerland. Cosima awoke to its opening melody. Conductor Hans Richter learned the trumpet in order to play the brief trumpet part, which lasts only 13 measures, in that private performance, reportedly having sailed out to the centre of Lake Lucerne to practise, so as not to be heard.

The original title was &quot;Triebschen Idyll with Fidi&#x27;s birdsong and the orange sunrise, as symphonic birthday greeting. Presented to his Cosima by her Richard&quot;. &quot;Fidi&quot; was the family&#x27;s nickname for their son Siegfried. It is thought that the birdsong and the sunrise refer to incidents of personal significance to the couple.

Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Siegfried&quot;, which was premiered in 1876, incorporates music from the &quot;Idyll&quot;. Wagner adapted the material from an unfinished chamber piece into the &quot;Idyll&quot; before giving the theme to Brünnhilde in the opera&#x27;s final scene, the &quot;Ewig war ich&quot; love duet between Brünnhilde and Siegfried. This theme, Wagner claimed, came to him during the summer of 1864 at the Villa Pellet, overlooking Lake Starnberg, where he and Cosima consummated their union. He is contradicted, however, by his own obsessive record keeping: the melody was composed that 14 November, when he was alone in Munich. The work also uses a theme based on the German lullaby, &quot;Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf&quot;, which was jotted down by Wagner on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1868 and introduced by a solo oboe. Ernest Newman discovered it was linked to the Wagners&#x27; older daughter Eva. This and other musical references, whose meaning remained unknown to the outside world for many years, reveal the idyll&#x27;s levels of personal significance for both Wagner and Cosima.

Wagner originally intended the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; to remain a private piece. However, due to financial pressures, he decided to sell the score to publisher B. Schott in 1878. In doing so, Wagner expanded the orchestration to 35 players to make the piece more marketable. The original piece is scored for a small chamber orchestra of 13 players: flute, oboe, two clarinets, bassoon, two horns, trumpet, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. The piece is commonly played today by orchestras with more than one player on each string part. Modern performances are much slower than those of earlier years.

<text>Philip de Harcourt was a medieval Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Bayeux. He was unsuccessfully elected as the Bishop of Salisbury.

==Life==

De Harcourt was the son of Robert who was the son of Anschetil, lord of Harcourt, Eure in France. He was the dean of the collegiate church at Beaumont-le-Roger in Normandy by 1131 before being appointed Dean of Lincoln about 1133. During this time he appears to have been made a Prebendary of Aylesbury. He was also archdeacon of Évreux as well. He was Lord Chancellor for King Stephen of England from 1139 to 1140, resigning probably in March. Philip was a partisan of Waleran, Count of Meulan.

In March 1140 de Harcourt was nominated to the Bishopric of Salisbury but the election was quashed in 1141. He was nominated by King Stephen with the advice of Waleran of Melun, but Philip&#x27;s election was opposed by Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester who was also the papal legate in England and Stephen&#x27;s brother. Philip appealed to Pope Innocent II but was refused.

In 1142 de Harcourt was named Bishop of Bayeux, an office he held until 1163.

<text>Robert of Ghent, also called Robert de Gant, ( 1085–after 1154) was Lord Chancellor of England and Dean of York in the 12th century. The younger son of a nobleman, Robert was probably a member of the cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, but why this is so is unknown. He became dean at York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158.

==Early life==

Robert was probably one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert&#x27;s conjectured siblings were Emma (wife of Alan de Percy), Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant (who died before his father), and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert was probably also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.

Robert&#x27;s first appearance in the historical record is at Ramsey Abbey sometime between 1114 and 1123, where he appears as a witness to a charter. A further appearance is in a document of his brother Walter dating between 1130 and 1139. It is likely that Robert was a canon of York Cathedral before 1147. He is also claimed to have held the office of Provost of Beverley Minster as the immediate predecessor to Thomas Becket, but this is unlikely, as Becket did not become provost until 1154, long after Robert had become Dean of York.

==Chancellor==

Robert was Lord Chancellor from spring 1140 to summer 1154, serving King Stephen of England. It is not known exactly when Stephen appointed Robert chancellor nor why Stephen chose him for the office. Historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant, perhaps because of Walter&#x27;s presence at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138. Three charters, which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and are supposed to be witnessed by Robert, all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually his, so exact dating of his term of office isn&#x27;t possible from charter evidence. For a brief period in 1141, Stephen&#x27;s rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors – William de Vere and William fitzGilbert – but they did not interrupt Robert&#x27;s term of service. Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143, where he was a witness on charters. Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor, Robert only witnessed 20 charters for certain and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert. Stephen&#x27;s two previous chancellors, Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt, had a much higher rate of attesting charters – 62 in three and a half years for Roger and 12 in nine months for Philip. Even Baldric, Robert&#x27;s subordinate and holder of the office of Keeper of the Royal Seal, attested 17 charters during Stephen&#x27;s reign. Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors, including indifference to his office, deputising the duties to another clerk, or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age. Robert&#x27;s last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln.

It is possible that Robert fell out with Stephen in the last months of the king&#x27;s reign – Stephen died in October 1154. Stephen besieged Drax Castle in the summer of 1154, which had earlier been given to Robert&#x27;s nephew, Robert. The younger Robert may have objected to giving up his castle to the previous owners and the elder Robert may have taken offence at these events. This would explain why Robert does not appear on Stephen&#x27;s charters after the Lincoln charter of 1154, but this theory is just speculation by one of Robert&#x27;s biographers. Robert was replaced as chancellor by Becket shortly after Henry II&#x27;s coronation on 19 December 1154 and before January 1155.

==Dean of York==

Robert held the office of Dean of York from at least 1147, but may have occupied the office as early as 1142. He may have been still alive as late as 1157, as it is possible he was the addressee of a letter from the papacy in January 1157. His last secure attestation as dean is in October 1154. Although Keats-Rohan states in &quot;Domesday Descendants&quot; that Robert was also Archdeacon of York, he is not so listed in the &quot;Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae&quot; under any of the archdeaconries.

In 1147 William fitzHerbert, the Archbishop of York, was deposed, and a new election for the archbishopric was ordered by Pope Eugenius III on 11 May 1147. The election took place on 24 July 1147 at Richmond rather than York, due to the opposition of William of Aumale, the Earl of York, who supported the ousted archbishop. Robert, along with Hugh de Puiset and some of the cathedral chapter, favoured Hilary, a canon lawyer. Most of the rest of the archdiocese&#x27;s officials and the chapter favoured Henry Murdac. The disputed election was decided by the pope, who declared Murdac the new archbishop and gave the vacant bishopric of Chichester to Hilary. Murdac was consecrated by Eugenius on 7 December 1147, and Robert appears to have supported the new archbishop, or at least not to have actively opposed him. But others among the cathedral chapter and suffragan bishops of York continued to actively agitate against Murdac, including refusing him entry to York for three years. Robert took little other part in the disputes at York during Murdac&#x27;s archiepiscopate. Probably, it was Robert&#x27;s involvement in secular office as chancellor that restricted his activities with his ecclesiastical office. Robert may have become a supporter of Murdac&#x27;s during this time, as the archbishop addressed at least six confirmation grants to Robert.

William was re-elected to York after Murdac&#x27;s death in 1153. When William attempted to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they then went to Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William&#x27;s actions. It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William&#x27;s death, Robert, once more acting with Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen&#x27;s choice of Roger de Pont L&#x27;Évêque as the new Archbishop of York. Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert&#x27;s opposition to William, there is no evidence that Robert was ever thought to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William.

==Death==

The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan records his death as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert&#x27;s successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first securely attested as dean on 6 May 1158, and the last secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, which suggests that Robert of Ghent died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.

<text>Angels of Youth, by Luigi Fontanella, is a book of poems written originally in Italian and based on his Italian volume &quot;Ceres&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
It is divided into four sections, Ceres, Stanzas for Emma, Ars Poetica, and Ballads.

It includes &quot;Stanzas for Emma&quot; dedicated to the poet&#x27;s daughter, and &quot;Sequence for my Father&quot; which reflects on his dead parent.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Angels of Youth&quot; is a translation of &quot;Ceres&quot;, Fontanella&#x27;s ninth volume of poetry, originally published in Italian by Caramanica Editore in 1993. The Italian edition won The Orazio Caputo Prize and The Olindo de Gennaro Prize, and received over thirty reviews in prestigious literary journals in Europe and the United States. Devised with American readers in mind, the Xenos Books translation makes subtle modifications in the content, reorganizes the book&#x27;s structure and adds two new poems.

==Critical response==
Prof Ken Scambray (University of La Verne) suggested it redefines Italian-American literature by moving away from its stereotypical images, praising its realism and ability to find beauty in the quotidian.

<doc id="625601" wikidata="Q29656" url="?curid=625601" title="State of Kanawha">
<text>Kanawha was a proposed name for the 39 counties which later became the main body of the U.S. state of West Virginia, formed on October 24, 1861. It consisted of most of the far northwestern counties of Virginia, which voted to secede from the state after Virginia joined the Confederate States of America at the beginning of the American Civil War on April 17, 1861.

==Background==
=== The Wheeling Conventions ===
The geopolitical separation from Virginia had been approved by the Second Wheeling Convention of August 20, 1861. The proposed name of &quot;Kanawha&quot; was based on the prominence of the Kanawha River running through the area (itself named after the local Canawagh, or Kanawha, Indian band, which were driven out of the area by the Iroquois sometime after 1780) and was originally proposed by a committee of the founding convention as the name for the new state.

=== Name change ===
During the First Constitutional Convention held in Wheeling on December 3, 1861, Harmon Sinsel, of Taylor County, made a motion to strike the word Kanawha from the new state constitution. The discussion regarding the motion revealed concerns of possible confusion between the State of Kanawha and the County of Kanawha within the same state. Additionally, there was an expressed desire among the convention members to reflect their Virginian heritage. After much debate, the motion passed 30–14, and a new name was sought.

During the subsequent discussion, names such as &quot;Allegheny&quot;, &quot;Augusta&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;New Virginia&quot;, &quot;Vandalia&quot; (namesake of the failed Vandalia colony of the previous century), &quot;West Virginia&quot;, and &quot;Western Virginia&quot; were suggested; it was decided that roll would be called and each member of the convention would answer their name with their preferred name for the new state. When one of the names reached a majority vote, it would be selected as the new name for the state. Upon the roll call, 30 of the 44 members had selected &quot;West Virginia&quot;. Having reached a majority, the name for the new state officially became West Virginia.

==Geography==
During the constitutional convention the boundaries of the new state went through various changes. The original composition of the state consisted of 39 counties, 15 of which were secessionist and had voted in favor of Virginia&#x27;s secession from the United States on May 23, 1861. Eventually nine more secessionist counties were added to the new state.

==West Virginia statehood==
West Virginia, by then comprising 50 counties carved out of the Shenandoah Valley and northwestern and southwestern Virginia, was officially announced as a new state by President Abraham Lincoln on April 20, 1863, effective sixty days thereafter. West Virginia was formally admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.

<text>Emiko Shiratori ( &quot;Shiratori Emiko&quot;; born March 16, 1950) is a Japanese singer and songwriter.

In 1969, the record label Toshiba EMI (now EMI Music Japan) paired her with Sumio Akutagawa, and they formed the folk group Toi et Moi. They achieved great success in Japan, and from 1969 to 1973 released an average of two albums and four singles a year. In 1973, Shiratori released her first solo album and continued as a solo artist throughout the 1970s. She performed at the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics and the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics.

As a vocalist for the video game &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, she performed the main theme &quot;Melodies of Life&quot; in both Japanese and English. Due to the English version&#x27;s popularity, a special single was released, &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; Original Soundtrack&quot;. In 2006, she was asked by Nobuo Uematsu to perform a &quot;defining version&quot; of the song at the Final Fantasy Voices Concert; she sang a version that combined the Japanese and English lyrics.

Shiratori also performed a vocal arrangement of &quot;Epona&#x27;s Song&quot; for &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Re-Arranged Album&quot;, and narrated, as well as performed, the opening and ending themes to the 1990-1992 &quot;Moomin&quot; anime television series. She also performed &quot;Do-Re-Mi-Fa Lullaby&quot;, the ending theme to the second Unico movie, &quot;Unico in the Island of Magic&quot;, although the song was changed to an instrumental in the film&#x27;s English version.

Shiratori has had at least one song on the NHK program &quot;Minna no Uta&quot;.

She is the wife of composer and music producer Sumio Shiratori, and mother of singer Maika Shiratori.

<text>AllOfMP3, MP3Sparks and MemphisMembers are brands of online music store that were operated by Mediaservices, Inc., a company founded in 2000 in Moscow, Russia. The stores formerly sold music encoded in standard, non-protected audio formats at a significantly lower cost than other online music stores. In 2008, the original AllOfMp3 site was replaced by a blog.

The company has been plagued by legal issues for some time due to accusations, mainly from the record industry, that they are operating illegally and engaging in music piracy.

== Revenue ==

Run by the Moscow company MediaServices, AllOfMP3 had an estimated revenue of US$30 million in 2006. According to the IFPI and various other label representatives the company has never transferred money to any (western) label. AllofMP3 claims to have offered settlements to IFPI, which AllOfMP3 claims IFPI refused to accept.

== Legal issues ==

AllOfMP3&#x27;s legality is controversial. It is licensed in Russia by the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems, a licence similar to agreements held by Russian radio stations. AllOfMP3 states that this agreement allows it to distribute music legally from all artists and all labels. This is disputed by most major record labels, which generally do not recognize ROMS or believe that it has the authority to distribute their works. AllOfMP3.com makes no claims as to its legality outside of Russia. However it is accessible to visitors in all countries.

In 2005, Moscow authorities began investigating the site as a result of a formal complaint from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), who accused the site of &quot;large-scale copyright infringement&quot;.

On June 1, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that US trade negotiators have warned Russia that the continued existence of AllOfMP3 could jeopardize Russia&#x27;s entry into the World Trade Organization. This was reiterated by the United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab in remarks to the US Chamber of Commerce on September 28, 2006. She later told reporters that &quot;I have a hard time imagining Russia becoming a member of the WTO and having a Web site like that up and running that is so clearly a violation of everyone&#x27;s intellectual property rights.&quot;

Pressure from the IFPI resulted in AllOfMP3 being blocked by the Danish ISP, Tele2 in October 2006.

On December 18, 2006, the RIAA, on behalf of EMI, Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group filed a US$1.65 trillion lawsuit against the site. That equates to US$150,000 for each of 11 million songs downloaded between June and October 2006, and exceeds Russia&#x27;s entire GDP. $150,000 is the statutory limit for copyright infringement awards in the United States. Allofmp3 responded to the lawsuit saying &quot;AllofMP3 understands that several U.S. record label companies filed a lawsuit against Media Services in New York. This suit is unjustified as AllofMP3 does not operate in New York. Certainly the labels are free to file any suit they wish, despite knowing full well that AllofMP3 operates legally in Russia. In the meantime, AllofMP3 plans to continue to operate legally and comply with all Russian laws.&quot;.

In May 2007, UK police arrested a 25-year-old man on fraud charges for selling allofmp3.com vouchers on sites such as eBay and allofmp3vouchers.co.uk. The man was reported to be funneling money from the sale of these vouchers back to the owners of the site in Russia. A statement in relation to this alleged transfer of funds to Russia was made by the British Phonographic Industry chairman.

In 2007 Allofmp3 was banned from service by its payment processor ChronoPay.

In an interview with p2pnet, a MediaServices representative said &quot;It is disappointing that United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab completely and deliberately mischaracterized AllofMP3.com. Furthermore, it is irresponsible to use AllofMP3.com as a negotiating instrument in an attempt to extract concessions from Russia in return for US support for accession to the World Trade Organization&quot;.

In July 2007, a Moscow court ruled that Visa&#x27;s decision to cut off payments to allTunes was illegal.

In August 2007, Denis Kvasov, head of the company which owned AllofMP3.com, was acquitted of all charges stemming from copyright infringement prosecution. The prosecution was seen as a test case of Russia&#x27;s commitment to fighting piracy, and was brought after EMI, NBC Universal and Time Warner lobbied for such prosecution.

In January 2008 The Register reported that MP3Sparks.com and its associated web sites were being hosted (since December 2007)
by AbdAllah Internet, a Turkish web hosting service which allegedly provides safe harbour for spam and malware operations as well as having strong links to the Russian Business Network. For this reason access to the AbdAllah network is blocked by some ISPs, including all UK members of LINX, therefore blocking access to MP3Sparks as well.

On May 20, 2008, the RIAA dropped all copyright infringement charges against AllOfMP3.com.

== Closure of AllOfMP3 ==

In June 2007, AllOfMP3 announced on their site that they were &quot;closed for maintenance&quot;, while Times Online reported that an unnamed person claiming to be an ex-employee told them it was closed down following pressure from the Russian government. MP3Sparks, however, remained available, as did the AllTunes download service.

Following the acquittal of Denis Kvasov by a Moscow court in August 2007, a brief message was posted at the site&#x27;s blog, stating &quot;The service will be resumed in the foreseeable future&quot;.

== About the services ==

The sites offer Russian and English user interfaces. All functions, except for the buying of songs and full length song previews, are available to unregistered users (and full length preview of songs is restricted to individuals who have spent a total of $50 or more on the website). Registration is free. The store maintains an account balance for each user; while a user&#x27;s account has a positive balance, they can continue downloading music. To do so, the user selects the files for download from the store&#x27;s catalog.

===Pricing model===

Unlike some US-based music stores such as Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store, MediaServices&#x27; sites charge for the volume of data downloaded, not for individual songs.

This price is often reduced by a complicated system of discounts based on cumulative usage, promotions, and type of payment.

===Payment methods===

The sites operate using a pre-paid balance method. Users fund their account using a credit or debit card, in increments of US$10 or more.

However, action taken in late 2006 by Visa and MasterCard made it impossible for users to fund their accounts at the main AllOfMP3 site.

Users outside UK and US can also pay using a variety of credit cards at ChronoPay processor. ChronoPay had announced on March 20, 2007, that they would no longer be processing payments from online Russian music stores that only hold a ROMS license (e.g. AllOfMP3), but this does not apply to MP3Sparks which has an NP FAIR license.

Between April and June 2007, it had become difficult for users to fund their AllOfMP3 accounts themselves, and a number of users and sites began selling AllOfMP3 gift vouchers on the Internet. However, in May 2007 a man who had been selling vouchers was arrested in London, and this led many other voucher sellers to shut down their operations.

===Download formats===

AllOfMP3 (and now MP3Sparks) allows users to choose from a variety of audio codecs for audio files. Lossy formats are offered in constant bitrates up to 320 kbit/s or variable bitrates up to maximum quality in the following formats:
*MP3
*WMA
*Ogg Vorbis
*MPEG4-AAC
*MPC
Select albums are also being made available in Lossless audio codecs in the following formats:
*FLAC
*PCM
*Monkey&#x27;s Audio
*OptimFROG
*WMA Lossless
Most music is encoded straight from source, which is dubbed &quot;Online Encoding Exclusive&quot;, so gapless albums could provide gapless playback, unlike most other music services. There is no extra charge for using the Online Encoding Exclusive service. The user sets the codec parameters, including the desired bitrate, allowing for superior quality over other music download services such as iTunes and Napster.

Downloaded files do not contain digital rights management information, allowing unrestricted use between multiple computers and digital audio players. This differentiates AllOfMP3 from many other music download services, which limit the use of the music the user may purchase and the platforms on which it may be played.

The websites also offer free, full album previews, streamed at a bitrate of 24 kilobits per second (roughly equivalent to analog telephone audio quality). Registered users who have spent less than $50 have access to 90 second samples, and unregistered users have access to 30 second samples.

==== Music for Masses ====

In late 2006, AllOfMP3 experimented with a feature called &quot;Music for Masses&quot; which allowed users to download DRM-protected music for free. The files were encoded in a proprietary MP3 format (.mp3x) that could only be played in the Music for Masses player, and could not be transferred to a portable media device. However, the DRM protection was cracked within a week. Although AllOfMP3 released a compulsory update to the player software which rendered the original crack unusable, they eventually removed the service in December 2006.

<text>William de Vere (died 1198) was Bishop of Hereford and an Augustinian canon.

==Biography==
The son of Aubrey de Vere II and Adeliza of Clare, probably the fourth of five sons, and brother of Aubrey de Vere III first earl of Oxford, de Vere spent part of his youth at the court of King Henry I of England and his second wife, Queen Adeliza of Leuven. Little is known of his education, but he had received minor ecclesiastical orders before 1141. He was a friend of Bishop Arnulf of Liseux, and may have studied in Paris.

William de Vere was promised the chancellorship of England by the Empress Matilda in the 1141 charter by which his brother was made earl, but given the political and military setbacks she suffered in that and subsequent years, it is not surprising that there is no record that he served as her chancellor. He later entered the household of Archbishop Theobald of Bec of Canterbury (d. 1163). He served in the archbishop&#x27;s household with near-contemporaries Thomas Becket and John of Salisbury in the 1150s. Theobald sent him on diplomatic errands to France in the early 1160s. He is thought to have served briefly as a secular canon of St. Paul&#x27;s, London, about 1163, but that William de Vere may have been a member of an unrelated Ver family associated with the bishop of London in Domesday Book. William became an Augustinian canon at St Osyth&#x27;s Priory at Chich, Essex, for from that monastery he was recruited in 1177 by King Henry II to supervise the rebuilding of Waltham Abbey in Essex to house an Augustinian canonry. His name is one of two listed in the Pipe rolls as receiving monies toward that project.

King Henry later employed de Vere as an itinerant justice, then nominated him as Bishop of Hereford on 25 May 1186. He was consecrated on 10 August 1186. In that office he occasionally continued to serve as a royal justice under Richard I. Bishop William is credited with having extended the east end of Hereford Cathedral, constructing the transitional retrochoir, two transept chapels, and possibly a lady chapel (the latter two areas replaced by his successors). He is also thought to have constructed the bishop&#x27;s palace at Hereford. He expanded the work of his predecessors in the administration of the diocese and employed Gerald of Wales and Robert Grosseteste.

As a canon at St. Osyth&#x27;s, de Vere wrote a Latin life of that saint, which now exists only in fragments recorded by antiquarian John Leland in the sixteenth century. In that work he made references to his family. He donated a relic of St. Osyth to Waltham Abbey, and promoted the cult of that saint at Hereford Cathedral. He may have visited Palestine, perhaps in 1178 or in 1182–1185.

De Vere was one of several bishops who excommunicated Prince John and his supporters in 1194, and was present at Winchester Cathedral for the recoronation of King Richard I in April 1194. William de Vere died in December 1198 and is buried in Hereford Cathedral, where his tomb with an effigy can be found.

<doc id="625626" wikidata="Q7181805" url="?curid=625626" title="Phil Cool">
<text>Phil Cool (born Philip Martin; April 1948) is a retired English comedian, impressionist and musician. He starred in his own television series &quot;Cool It&quot; (1985–1990), &quot;Cool Head&quot; (1991) and &quot;Phil Cool&quot; (1992), and performed as a touring comedian until his retirement in 2013.

==Early life==
Born in Chorley, Lancashire, Cool discovered that he had a skill for pulling faces when he was a 12-year-old at school. Once he left school he worked briefly in a warehouse and as an electrician before turning professional as a comedian and impressionist.

==Career==

Whereas many of his impressionist peers concentrated on mimicking the voice of the target and changing in and out of a succession of make-up and costumes, Cool instead placed an emphasis on thrusting his eyebrows, lips and even, seemingly, his ears into the positions required of the part.

Cool&#x27;s debut television appearance was in the short-lived comedy show &quot;Rock With Laughter&quot;, it was around this time that he made a career-defining performance at Jasper Carrott&#x27;s Folk Club &quot;The Boggery&quot;. Carrott was impressed with Cool&#x27;s act and decided to take an active hand in furthering his career. In 1983 he appeared as a regular on the &quot;O.T.T.&quot; spin-off &quot;Saturday Stayback&quot; and, in 1984, he became one of the voice artists for the satirical show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, impersonating Boy George, Holly Johnson and Mick Jagger for the first two series. It was during his time on &quot;Spitting Image&quot; that a producer for the BBC spotted him, and got him work on &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;.

After the success of these appearances, he was given his own series called &quot;Cool It&quot; (BBC). The first series of &quot;Cool It&quot; was repeated within a matter of months. There was a tie-in video release of the best moments of &quot;Cool It&quot;. The second series aired in 1986 and was also produced by Jasper Carrott. The BBC released another video &quot;Cool It Too&quot;. Cool recorded an album on Virgin Records called &quot;Not Just a Pretty Face&quot;, and a book titled &quot;Cool&#x27;s Out&quot;. In 1987, he performed at &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot;. The third and final series was broadcast in 1988.

In 1989 he appeared in the mini-film &quot;Night of the Comic Dead&quot; alongside Frank Carson, Karl Howman and Howard Lew Lewis as part of A Night of Comic Relief 2. His third video, &quot;Cool &#x27;N&#x27; Hot&quot;, was filmed live at the Royal Leamington Spa Centre in 1989. In 1991 he moved to ITV and made a series called &quot;Cool Head&quot; (Central Television).

In the same year Central released a video showcasing some of the best moments of &quot;Cool Head&quot;. A year later he made another series for Central that was entitled &quot;Phil Cool&quot;, recorded at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. This turned out to be Cool&#x27;s last series for television.

In 1992 Cool teamed up with Jasper Carrott and toured the country with their &quot;Carrott &amp; Cool&quot; show. The &quot;Carrott &amp; Cool&quot; tour was the subject for one episode of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; for Channel 4 in 1993. The episode took a behind-the-scenes look at the show and tour. He had a brief comeback in 1997 when he released his fifth official video, &quot;Classic Cool&quot; (this has been reissued on DVD), but in August 2000 his career had to be put on hold when he suffered a heart attack, which left him in hospital for eight months.

After making a full recovery he returned to the stage with a new show in 2002, and in 2003 he revived his touring partnership with Carrott. He is now a resident in Chipping, Lancashire. In addition to his solo gigs, Cool toured in 2008 with Ken Nicol, performing as Nicol and Cool, providing a blend of music and comedy impressions. Nicol and Cool toured with folk rock group Fairport Convention as a support act for Fairport&#x27;s 2009 winter tour. They released an album, also called &quot;Nicol &amp; Cool&quot;.

Cool&#x27;s most recent television and film work has been an appearance on &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot; in 2006, being interviewed as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Light Entertainment&quot; and appearing in the movies &quot;Upstaged&quot; (2005) and &quot;The School That Roared&quot; (2009).

Cool&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Phil Cool Died Here (And Lived To Tell The Tale)&quot;, was followed by a book of &#x27;Art Brut&#x27;-inspired sketches of children.

In 2013 Cool began a farewell nationwide tour, declaring it would be his last because he had &quot;just had enough of all the travelling&quot;.

==Legacy==
Writing for the BBC in 2003, author Mark Lewisohn said: &quot;Cool was an amazing talent... able to contort his features into a caricature semblance of the intended victim. Sometimes so uncanny was this facial transformation that he didn&#x27;t need traditional sketch material.&quot;

The 2008 album &quot;&quot; by Half Man Half Biscuit contains a song called &quot;National Shite Day&quot;, in which a character named &quot;Stringy Bob&quot; had been locked up for sending Phil Cool a dead bird in the mail, with a note that said &quot;Is this your sanderling?&quot;.

In a 2013 interview, comedian and director Stephen Merchant remarked: &quot;Cool could genuinely contort his face; he was kind [of] extraordinary as an impressionist because he would actually change his face, without makeup, to look like the people he was doing. And he did this Aquaphibian and he scrunched his face up, and I remember just actually weeping with laughter. I had never seen anything as funny as that.&quot;

<text>The Curlew is a song cycle by Peter Warlock on poems by W. B. Yeats. It is generally considered one of the composer&#x27;s finest works.

It was written between 1920 and 1922 for singer and an unusual accompanying group of flute, cor anglais and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello). Warlock completed the work in Cefn Bryntalch, his family home in Llandyssil, near Montgomery in Wales.

There are four songs, with a short instrumental interlude. The poems they are based on (with the first line in parentheses) are:

#&quot;He Reproves the Curlew&quot; (&quot;O Curlew, cry no more in the air&quot;)
#&quot;The lover mourns for the loss of love&quot; (&quot;Pale brows, still hands and dim hair&quot;)
#&quot;The Withering of the Boughs&quot; (&quot;I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds:&quot;)
#Interlude
#&quot;He Hears the Cry of the Sedge&quot; (&quot;I wander by the edge of this desolate lake&quot;)

&quot;The Withering of the Boughs&quot; was taken from &quot;In the Seven Woods,&quot; while the other poems were taken from &quot;The Wind Among the Reeds&quot;.

There is a lengthy instrumental introduction to the first song, in which the cry of the curlew is represented by the cor anglais and the peewit by the flute. The songs, which concern lost love, are melancholy in mood.
A number of motif elements recur throughout the songs dependent on the point in the text – a structural technique also found in many others of Warlock&#x27;s songs. The cycle lasts around twenty-five minutes.

Four of the songs later to be incorporated into the cycle were performed by Gerald Cooper on 6 October 1920 at the Mortimer Hall in London. The first complete performance took place on 23 November 1922, sung by Philip Wilson. Warlock wrote to his mentor Colin Taylor: &quot;for the first time in my life I really feel pleased with something I have written. Wilson buggered up the voice part completely but the instrumentalists were fine. It&#x27;s going to be given again in January with another singer, John Goss, who will do it far better&quot;. The performance with John Goss took place on 31 January, 1923 at the Hyde Park Hotel.

&quot;The Curlew&quot; won the Carnegie Award in 1923. In making the award the trustees wrote: &#x27;A most imaginative setting of Mr Yeats&#x27;s poems, of which, indeed, it may be regarded as the musical counterpart. It is pervaded by a keen feeling for harmonic colour, which is here used to most appropriate effect&#x27;.

==Recordings==
&quot;The Curlew&quot; was well served by the gramophone, three excellent recordings having been made within the first thirty years after its composition:
* John Armstrong (tenor), Robert Murchie (flute), T. McDonagh (English horn), International String Quartet (Mangeot, Price, Bray, Shineburne) conducted by Constant Lambert (National Gramophonic Society 163–165). This recording was made with the personnel who gave the notable Warlock Memorial performance on 23 February 1931 at the Wigmore Hall, to preserve the benefit of their rehearsed ensemble.
* René Soames (tenor), Geoffrey Gilbert (flute), Léon Goossens (English horn), Aeolian String Quartet (Cave, Williams, Forbes, Moore) (HMV 3x12&quot; 78rpm discs C 7934-36) (27 March and 12 April 1950). Recorded under auspices of the British Council.
* Alexander Young (tenor), Lionel Solomon (flute), Peter Graeme (English horn), Sebastian String Quartet (Argo LP RG 26) (January 1954)
* There are numerous more recent recordings.

<text>Lingzhi, Ganoderma sichuanense, also known as reishi or Ganoderma lingzhi is a polypore fungus (&quot;bracket fungus&quot;) native to East Asia belonging to the genus &quot;Ganoderma&quot;.

Its reddish brown, varnished, kidney-shaped cap with bands and peripherally inserted stem give it a distinct fan-like appearance. When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks gills on its underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores (80–120 μm) in yellow colors.

In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially maples. Only two or three out of 10,000 such trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is rare. Lingzhi may be cultivated on hardwood logs, sawdust, or woodchips.

The lingzhi mushroom is used in traditional Chinese medicine. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that consuming &quot;Ganoderma&quot; mushrooms in any form has any effect on human health or diseases.

== Taxonomy ==
Lingzhi, also known as &quot;reishi&quot; from its Japanese pronunciation, is the ancient &quot;mushroom of immortality&quot;, revered for over 2,000 years (with some evidence suggesting use in Neolithic China 6,800 years ago). However, as of 2023 there is an ongoing debate on which one of the described &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species is the true lingzhi mushroom. It is also likely that a few similar &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species were considered interchangeable.

In the scientific literature, the lingzhi mushroom is ambiguously referred to as:

* &quot;Ganoderma sichuanense&quot; — the currently accepted name, described by Zhao and Zhang (1983).
* &quot;Ganoderma lingzhi&quot; — described by Cao et al. (2012) as a novel species that may the best fit for traditional definitions of the lingzhi mushroom. However, Du et al. (2023) found that it is the same species as &quot;G. sichuanense&quot;, so it is now treated as a later synonym.
* &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; — the type species of &quot;Ganoderma&quot; was first described in 1781 by Curtis as &quot;Boletus lucidus&quot; based on European collections. In 1881 Karst designated it as the type species of his new genus &quot;Ganoderma,&quot; as &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot;. Early literature used &quot;G. lucidum&quot; for collections from China, but it was later established that Asian populations are distinct from European, both morphologically and phylogenetically. As the lingzhi fungus is strongly rooted in culture, the old name persists, even though it is well established that &quot;G. sichuanense&quot; and &quot;G. lucidum&quot; are distinct species. This leads to a lot of confusion in culture, as well as in the scientific community, when trying to codify and describe its medicinal uses.

One source employed to solve the task of identifying the traditional lingzhi mushroom is the 16th century Chinese herbal compendium, the (1578). There, a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms defined by color were used for different purposes. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017), as well as other researchers, and based on molecular work, red lingzhi is most likely to be &quot;Ganoderma sichuanense&quot;.

&quot;Ganoderma sichuanense&quot; is the most widely found species in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7–10 other &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names, and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives, which vary widely among species. Research on the genus is ongoing, but a number of recent phylogenetic analyses have been published in recent years.

=== Nomenclature ===
Petter Adolf Karsten first described the genus &quot;Ganoderma&quot; in 1881. He designated as its type species a European fungus named &quot;Boletus lucidus&quot; by English botanist William Curtis in 1781. Since then, many other &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species have been described.

The lingzhi&#x27;s botanical names have Greek and Latin roots. &quot;Ganoderma&quot; derives from the Greek (; ), and (; ). The specific epithet, &quot;sichuanense&quot;, comes from the Sichuan Chinese province. The common name, lingzhi, comes from Chinese, meaning .

=== Varieties ===
It was once thought that &quot;G. lingzhi&quot; generally occurred in two growth forms: a large, sessile, specimen with a small or nonexistent stalk, found in North America, and a smaller specimen with a long, narrow stalk, found mainly in the tropics. However, recent molecular evidence has identified the former, stalkless, form as a distinct species called &quot;G. sessile&quot;, a name given to North American specimens by William Alfonso Murrill in 1902.

Environmental conditions play a substantial role in the lingzhi&#x27;s manifest morphological characteristics. For example, elevated carbon dioxide levels result in stem in lingzhi. Other formations include antlers without a cap, which may also be related to carbon dioxide levels. The three main factors that influence fruit body development morphology are light, temperature, and humidity. While water and air quality play a role in fruit body development morphology, they do so to a lesser degree.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Ganoderma lingzhi&quot; is found in East Asia growing as a parasite or saprotroph on a variety of trees. &quot;Ganoderma curtisii&quot; and &quot;G. ravenelii&quot; are the closest relatives of the lingzhi mushroom in North America.

In the wild, lingzhi grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially maples. Only two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore it is extremely rare in its natural form. Today, lingzhi is effectively cultivated on hardwood logs or sawdust/woodchips.

== Uses ==

=== Clinical research and phytochemistry ===

&quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; contains diverse phytochemicals, including triterpenes (ganoderic acids), which have a molecular structure similar to that of steroid hormones. It also contains phytochemicals found in fungal materials, including polysaccharides (such as beta-glucan), coumarin, mannitol, and alkaloids. Sterols isolated from the mushroom include ganoderol, ganoderenic acid, ganoderiol, ganodermanontriol, lucidadiol, and ganodermadiol. It is likely the that different &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species called Lingzhi vary in their chemical constituents, and that confusion about naming makes it difficult to interpret the supporting literature.

A 2015 Cochrane database review found insufficient evidence to justify the use of &quot;G. lucidum&quot; as a first-line cancer treatment. It stated that &quot;G. lucidum&quot; may have &quot;benefit as an alternative adjunct to conventional treatment in consideration of its potential of enhancing tumour response and stimulating host immunity.&quot; Existing studies do not support the use of &quot;G. lucidum&quot; for treatment of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

=== Folk medicine ===

Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract product for use in folk medicine. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) is added to boiling water which is then reduced to a simmer, covered, and left for 2 hours. The resulting liquid is dark and fairly bitter in taste. The red lingzhi is often more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated to increase the concentration. Alternatively, it can be used as an ingredient in a formula decoction, or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form).

=== Other uses ===
Lingzhi is commercially manufactured and sold. Since the early 1970s, most lingzhi is cultivated. Lingzhi can grow on substrates such as sawdust, grain, and wood logs. After formation of the fruiting body, lingzhi is most commonly harvested, dried, ground, and processed into tablets or capsules to be directly ingested or made into tea or soup. Other lingzhi products include processed fungal mycelia or spores. Lingzhi is also used to create mycelium bricks.

==Cultural significance==

In the chronicles of (1st century CE from Sima Qian), the initial use of nearby separately related words with and are attested to in the poems of Emperor Wu of Han. Later, in the 1st century CE through the poetry of Ban Gu, occurred the first combination of the characters together into a single word, in an ode dedicated to Lingzhi.

Since ancient times, Taoist temples were called &quot;the abode of mushrooms&quot; and according to their mystical teachings, the use of woody mushrooms (Ganoderma) or &quot;spirits mushroom&quot;, in particular making from it a concentrated decoction of hallucinogenic action, gave followers the opportunity to see spirits or become spirits themselves by receiving the magical energy of the immortals , located on the &quot;fields of grace&quot; in the heavenly &quot;mushroom fields&quot; (.

In the philosophical work , it is said that the lingzhi mushroom is personification of nobility; from which shamans brewed a psychedelic drink.

The (&quot;Divine Farmer&#x27;s Classic of Pharmaceutics&quot;) of classifies into six color categories, each of which is believed to benefit the , or &quot;life force&quot;, in a different part of the body: (; ) for the liver, (; ) for the heart, (; ) for the spleen, (; ) for the lungs, (; ) for the kidneys, and (; ) for the Essence. Commentators identify the red , or (; ), as the lingzhi.

The author Li Shizhen classified these six differently colored &quot;zhi&quot; as &quot;xiancao&quot; (仙草; &quot;immortality herbs&quot;), and described the effects of &quot;chizhi&quot; (&quot;red mushroom&quot;):

In Chinese art, the &quot;lingzhi&quot; symbolizes great health and longevity, as depicted in the imperial Forbidden City and Summer Palace. It was a talisman for luck in the traditional culture of China, and the goddess of healing Guanyin is sometimes depicted holding a lingzhi mushroom.

=== Regional names ===

==== Chinese ====
The Old Chinese name for lingzhi was first recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 9 AD). In the Chinese language, () is a compound. It comprises (); &quot;spirit, spiritual; soul; miraculous; sacred; divine; mysterious; efficacious; effective)&quot; as, for example, in the name of the Lingyan Temple in Jinan, and (); &quot;(traditional) plant of longevity; fungus; seed; branch; mushroom; excrescence&quot;). Fabrizio Pregadio notes, &quot;The term &quot;zhi&quot;, which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or &#x27;excrescences&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Zhi&quot; occurs in other Chinese plant names, such as (; &quot;sesame&quot; or &quot;seed&quot;), and was anciently used a phonetic loan character for (; &quot;Angelica iris&quot;). Chinese differentiates &quot;Ganoderma&quot; species into (; &quot;red mushroom&quot;) &quot;G. lingzhi&quot;, and (; &quot;purple mushroom&quot;) &quot;Ganoderma sinense&quot;.

Lingzhi has several synonyms. Of these, (; &quot;auspicious plant&quot;) ( ; &quot;auspicious; felicitous omen&quot; with the suffix ; &quot;plant; herb&quot;) is the oldest; the &quot;Erya&quot; dictionary (c. 3rd century BCE) defines , interpreted as a of (; &quot;mushroom&quot;) as (; &quot;mushroom&quot;), and the commentary of Guo Pu (276–324) says, &quot;The [&quot;zhi&quot;] flowers three times in one year. It is a [&quot;ruicao&quot;] felicitous plant.&quot; Other Chinese names for &quot;Ganoderma&quot; include (; &quot;auspicious mushroom&quot;), (; &quot;divine mushroom&quot;, with shen; &quot;spirit; god&#x27; supernatural; divine&quot;), () (with &quot;tree; wood&quot;), (; &quot;immortality plant&quot;, with xian; &quot;(Daoism) transcendent; immortal; wizard&quot;), and () or (; &quot;mushroom plant&quot;).

Since both Chinese &quot;ling&quot; and &quot;zhi&quot; have multiple meanings, &quot;lingzhi&quot; has diverse English translations. Renditions include &quot;[zhi] possessed of soul power&quot;, &quot;Herb of Spiritual Potency&quot; or &quot;Mushroom of Immortality&quot;, &quot;Numinous Mushroom&quot;, &quot;divine mushroom&quot;, &quot;divine fungus&quot;, &quot;Magic Fungus&quot;, and &quot;Marvelous Fungus&quot;.

==== English ====
In English, &quot;lingzhi&quot; or &quot;ling chih&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;&quot;ling chi&quot;, using the French EFEO Chinese transcription) is a Chinese loanword. It is also commonly referred to as &quot;reishi&quot;&quot;, which is loaned from Japanese.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) gives the definition, &quot;The fungus &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; (actually &quot;Ganoderma lingzhi&quot; (see &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; for details), believed in China to confer longevity and used as a symbol of this on Chinese ceramic ware.&quot;, and identifies the etymology of the word as Chinese: &quot;líng&quot;, &quot;divine&quot; + &quot;zhī&quot;, &quot;fungus&quot;. According to the &quot;OED&quot;, the earliest recorded usage of the Wade–Giles romanization &quot;ling chih&quot; is 1904, and of the Pinyin &quot;lingzhi&quot; is 1980.

In addition to the transliterated loanwords, English names include &quot;glossy ganoderma&quot; and &quot;shiny polyporus&quot;.

==== Japanese ====
The Japanese word () is a Sino-Japanese loanword deriving from the Chinese (; ). Its modern Japanese kanji, , is the shinjitai (&quot;new character form&quot;) of the kyūjitai (&quot;old character form&quot;), . Synonyms for &quot;reishi&quot; are divided between Sino-Japanese borrowings and native Japanese coinages. Sinitic loanwords include literary terms such as (, from ; &quot;auspicious plant&quot;) and (, from ; &quot;immortality plant&quot;). The Japanese writing system uses or () for &quot;grass; lawn; turf&quot;, and &quot;take&quot; or () for &quot;mushroom&quot; (e.g., shiitake). A common native Japanese name is (; &quot;10,000-year mushroom&quot;). Other Japanese terms for &quot;reishi&quot; include (; &quot;departure mushroom&quot;), (; &quot;sage mushroom&quot;), and (; &quot;grandchild ladle&quot;).

==== Korean ====
The Korean name, () is also borrowed from, so a cognate with, the Chinese word (; ). It is often called &quot;yeongjibeoseot&quot; (; &quot;&quot;yeongji&quot; mushroom&quot;) in Korean, with the addition of the native word () meaning &quot;mushroom&quot;. Other common names include (; &quot;elixir grass&quot;) and (). According to color, &quot;yeongji&quot; mushrooms can be classified as () for &quot;red&quot;, () for &quot;purple&quot;, () for &quot;black&quot;, () for &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;green&quot;, () for &quot;white&quot;, and () for &quot;yellow&quot;. South Korea produces over 25,000 tons of mushrooms every year.

==== Thai ====
The Thai word () is a compound of the native word () meaning &quot;mushroom&quot; and the loanword () from the Chinese (; ).

==== Vietnamese ====
The Vietnamese language word is a loanword from Chinese. It is often used with , the Vietnamese word for &quot;mushroom&quot;, thus is the equivalent of &quot;lingzhi mushroom&quot;.

<text>Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are a class of antidepressant medications used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, social phobia, chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), and menopausal symptoms. Off-label uses include treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). SNRIs are monoamine reuptake inhibitors; specifically, they inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are thought to play an important role in mood regulation. SNRIs can be contrasted with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), which act upon single neurotransmitters.

The human serotonin transporter (SERT) and noradrenaline transporter (NAT) are membrane transport proteins that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic nerve terminal. Dual inhibition of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake can offer advantages over other antidepressant drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms. They can be especially useful in concomitant chronic or neuropathic pain.

SNRIs, along with SSRIs and NRIs, are second-generation antidepressants. Since their introduction in the late 1980s, second-generation antidepressants have largely replaced first-generation antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as the drugs of choice for the treatment of MDD due to their improved tolerability and safety profile.

== Medications ==
There are eight FDA approved SNRIs in the United States, with venlafaxine being the first drug to be developed in 1993 and levomilnacipran being the latest drug to be developed in 2013. The drugs vary by their other medical uses, chemical structure, adverse effects, and efficacy.

== History ==

In 1952, iproniazid, an antimycobacterial agent, was discovered to have psychoactive properties while researched as a possible treatment for tuberculosis. Researchers noted that patients given iproniazid became cheerful, more optimistic, and more physically active. Soon after its development, iproniazid and related substances were shown to slow enzymatic breakdown of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine via inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase. For this reason, this class of drugs became known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or MAOIs. During this time development of distinctively different antidepressant agents was also researched. Imipramine became the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Imipramine was found to affect numerous neurotransmitter systems and to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin from the synapse, therefore increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters. Use of MAOIs and TCAs gave major advances in treatment of depression but their use was limited by unpleasant side effects and significant safety and toxicity issues.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the catecholamine hypothesis of emotion and its relation to depression was of wide interest and that the decreased levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine might play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. This led to the development of fluoxetine, the first SSRI. The improved safety and tolerability profile of the SSRIs in patients with MDD, compared with TCAs and MAOIs, represented yet another important advance in the treatment of depression.

Since the late 1980s, SSRIs have dominated the antidepressant drug market. Today, there is increased interest in antidepressant drugs with broader mechanisms of action that may offer improvements in efficacy and tolerability. In 1993, a new drug was introduced to the US market called venlafaxine, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine was the first compound described in a new class of antidepressant substances called phenylethylamines. These substances are unrelated to TCA and other SSRIs. Venlafaxine blocks the neuronal reuptake of serotonin, noradrenaline and, to a lesser extent, dopamine in the central nervous system. In contrast with several other antidepressant drugs, venlafaxine can induce a rapid onset of action mainly due to a subsequent norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. See timeline in figure 1.

== Mechanism of action ==
Monoamines are connected to the pathophysiology of depression. Symptoms may occur because concentrations of neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, are insufficient, leading to downstream changes. Medications for depression affect the transmission of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Older and less selective antidepressants like TCAs and MAOIs inhibit the reuptake or metabolism of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain, which results in higher concentrations of neurotransmitters. Antidepressants that have dual mechanisms of action inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine and, in some cases, inhibit with weak effect the reuptake of dopamine.
Antidepressants affect variable neuronal receptors such as muscarinic cholinergic, α1- and α2-adrenergic, H1-histaminergic, and sodium channels in the cardiac muscle, leading to decreased cardiac conduction and cardiotoxicity associated particularly with TCAs, and to a lesser extent with SSRIs. Selectivity of antidepressant agents are based on the neurotransmitters that are thought to influence symptoms of depression.
Drugs that selectively block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine effectively treat depression and are better tolerated than TCAs. TCAs have comprehensive effects on various neurotransmitters receptors, which leads to lack of tolerability and increased risk of toxicity.

=== Tricyclic antidepressants ===

TCAs were the first medications that had dual mechanism of action. The mechanism of action of tricyclic secondary amine antidepressants is only partly understood. TCAs have dual inhibition effects on norepinephrine reuptake transporters and serotonin reuptake transporters. Increased norepinephrine and serotonin concentrations are obtained by inhibiting both of these transporter proteins. TCAs have substantially more affinity for norepinephrine reuptake proteins than the SSRIs. This is because of a formation of secondary amine TCA metabolites.

In addition, the TCAs interact with adrenergic receptors. This interaction seems to be critical for increased availability of norepinephrine in or near the synaptic clefts. Actions of imipramine-like tricyclic antidepressants have complex, secondary adaptions to their initial and sustained actions as inhibitors of norepinephrine transport and variable blockade of serotonin transport.

Norepinephrine interacts with postsynaptic α and β adrenergic receptor subtypes and presynaptic α2 autoreceptors. The α2 receptors include presynaptic autoreceptors which limit the neurophysiological activity of noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. Formation of norepinephrine is reduced by autoreceptors through the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, an effect mediated by decreased cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation-activation of the enzyme. α2 receptors also cause decreased intracellular cyclic AMP expression which results in smooth muscle relaxation or decreased secretion.

TCAs activate a negative feedback mechanism through their effects on presynaptic receptors. One probable explanation for the effects on decreased neurotransmitter release is that, as the receptors activate, inhibition of neurotransmitter release occurs (including suppression of voltage-gated Ca2+ currents and activation of G protein-coupled receptor-operated K+ currents). Repeated exposure of agents with this type of mechanism leads to inhibition of neurotransmitter release, but repeated administration of TCAs finally leads to decreased responses by α2 receptors. The desensitization of these responses may be due to increased exposure to endogenous norepinephrine or from the prolonged occupation of the norepinephrine transport mechanisms (via an allosteric effect). The adaptation allows the presynaptic synthesis and secretion of norepinephrine to return to, or even exceed, normal levels of norepinephrine in the synaptic clefts. Overall, inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake induced by TCAs leads to decreased rates of neuron firing (mediated through α2 autoreceptors), metabolic activity, and release of neurotransmitters.

TCAs do not block dopamine transport directly but might facilitate dopaminergic effects indirectly by inhibiting dopamine transport into noradrenergic terminals of the cerebral cortex. Because they affect so many different receptors, TCAs have adverse effects, poor tolerability, and an increased risk of toxicity.

=== Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ===
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and are a widely used group of antidepressants. With increased receptor selectivity compared to TCAs, undesired effects such as poor tolerability are avoided. Serotonin is synthesized from an amino acid called -tryptophan. Active transport system regulates the uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier. Serotonergic pathways are classified into two main ways in the brain: the ascending projections from the medial and dorsal raphe and the descending projections from the caudal raphe into the spinal cord.

=== Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ===
Noradrenergic neurons are located in two major regions in the brain, the locus coeruleus and lateral tegmental. With administration of SNRIs, neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus is induced because of increased concentration of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. This results in activation of α2 adrenergic receptors, as discussed previously.

Assays have shown that SNRIs have insignificant penchant for mACh, α1 and α2 adrenergic, or H1 receptors.

=== Dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ===
Agents with dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (SNRIs) are sometimes called non-tricyclic serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Clinical studies suggest that compounds that increase the concentration in the synaptic cleft of both norepinephrine and serotonin are more successful than single acting agents in the treatment of depression, but the data is not conclusive whether SNRIs are a more effective treatment option over SSRIs for depression.

The non-tricyclic SNRIs have several important differences that are based on pharmacokinetics, metabolism to active metabolites, inhibition of CYP isoforms, effect of drug-drug interactions, and the half-life of the nontricyclic SNRIs.

Combination of mechanisms of action in a single active agent is an important development in psychopharmacology.

== Structure activity relationship ==

===Aryloxypropanamine scaffold ===
Several reuptake inhibitors contain an aryloxypropanamine scaffold. This structural motif has potential for high affinity binding to biogenic amine transports. Drugs containing an aryloxypropanamine scaffold have selectivity profile for norepinephrine and serotonin transporters that depends on the substitution pattern of the aryloxy ring. Selective NRIs contain a substituent in 2&#x27; position of the aryloxy ring but SSRIs contain a substituent in 4&#x27; position of the aryloxy ring. Atomoxetine, nisoxetine and reboxetine all have a substitution group in the 2&#x27; position and are selective NRIs while compounds that have a substitution group in the 4&#x27; position (like fluoxetine and paroxetine) are SSRIs. Duloxetine contains a phenyl group fused at the 2&#x27; and 3&#x27; positions, therefore it has dual selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitory effects and has similar potencies for both transporters. The nature of the aromatic substituent also has a significant influence on the activity and selectivity of the compounds as inhibitors of the serotonin or the norepinephrine transporters.

=== Cycloalkanol ethylamine scaffold ===
Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine contain a cycloalkanol ethylamine scaffold. Increasing the electron-withdrawing nature of the aromatic ring provides a more potent inhibitory effect of norepinephrine uptake and improves the selectivity for norepinephrine over the serotonin transporter. Effects of chloro, methoxy and trifluoromethyl substituents in the aromatic ring of cycloalkanol ethylamine scaffold were tested. The results showed that the strongest electron-withdrawing &quot;m&quot;-trifluoromethyl analogue exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect of norepinephrine and the most selectivity over serotonin uptake. WY-46824, a piperazine-containing derivative, has shown norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition. Further synthesis and testing identified WAY-256805, a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that exhibited excellent selectivity and was efficacious in animal models of depression, pain, and thermoregulatory dysfunction.

=== Milnacipran ===

Milnacipran is structurally different from other SNRIs. The structure activity relationship of milnacipran derivatives at the transporter level is still largely unclear and is based on in vivo efficacy that was reported in 1987. &quot;N&quot;-methylation of milnacipran in substituent group R4 and R5 reduces the norepinephrine and serotonin activity. Researches on different secondary amides in substitution groups R6 and R7 showed that π electrons play an important role in the interaction between transporters and ligands. A phenyl group in substituent R6 showed effect on norepinephrine transporters. Substituent groups in R6 and R7 with allylic double bond showed significant improved effect on both norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. Studies show that introducing a 2-methyl group in substituent R3, the potency at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters are almost abolished. Methyl groups in substituent groups R1 and R2 also abolish the potency at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. Researchers found that replacing one of the ethyl groups of milnacipran with an allyl moiety increases the norepinephrine potency. The pharmacophore of milnacipran derivatives is still largely unclear.

The conformation of milnacipran is an important part of its pharmacophore. Changing its stereochemistry affects the norepinephrine and serotonin concentration. Milnacipran is marketed as a racemic mixture. Effects of milnacipran reside in the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer and substitution of the phenyl group in the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer has negative impact on norepinephrine concentration. Milnacipran has low molecular weight and low lipophilicity. Because of these properties, milnacipran exhibits almost ideal pharmacokinetics in humans such as high bioavailability, low inter-subject variability, limited liver enzyme interaction, moderate tissue distribution and a reasonably long elimination half-life. Milnacipran&#x27;s lack of drug-drug interactions via cytochrome P450 enzymes is thought to be an attractive feature because many of the central nervous system drugs are highly lipophilic and are mainly eliminated by liver enzymes.

=== Future development of structure activity relationship ===
The application of an aryloxypropanamine scaffold has generated a number of potent MAOIs. Before the development of duloxetine, the exploration of aryloxypropanamine structure activity relationships resulted in the identification of fluoxetine and atomoxetine. The same motif can be found in reboxetine where it is constrained in a morpholine ring system. Some studies have been made where the oxygen in reboxetine is replaced by sulfur to give arylthiomethyl morpholine. Some of the arylthiomethyl morpholine derivatives maintain potent levels of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition resides in different enantiomers for arylthiomethyl morpholine scaffold. Possible drug candidates with dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitory activity have also been derived from piperazine, 3-amino-pyrrolidine and benzylamine templates.

== Clinical trials ==
=== Depression ===
Several studies have shown that antidepressant drugs which have combined serotonergic and noradrenergic activity are generally more effective than SSRIs, which act upon serotonin reuptake by itself. Serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressant drugs may have a modest efficacy advantage compared to SSRIs in treating major depressive disorder (MDD), but are slightly less well tolerated. Further research is needed to examine the possible differences of efficacy in specific MDD sub-populations or for specific MDD symptoms, between these classes of antidepressant drugs.

=== Analgesic ===
Data from clinical trials have indicated that SNRIs might have pain relieving properties. Although the perception and transmission of pain stimuli in the central nervous system have not been fully elucidated, extensive data support a role for serotonin and norepinephrine in the modulation of pain. Findings from clinical trials in humans have shown these antidepressants can help to reduce pain and functional impairment in central and neuropathic pain conditions. This property of SNRIs might be used to reduce doses of other pain relieving medication and lower the frequency of safety, limited efficacy and tolerability issues.
Clinical research data have shown in patients with GAD that the SNRI duloxetine is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain-related symptoms of GAD, after short-term and long-term treatment. However, findings suggested that such symptoms of physical pain reoccur in relapse situations, which indicates a need for ongoing treatment in patients with GAD and concurrent painful physical symptoms.

==Indications==
SNRIs have been tested for treatment of the following conditions:

* Major depressive disorder (MDD)
* Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
* Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
* Social anxiety disorder (SAD)
* Obsessive compulsive disorder
* Panic disorder
* Neuropathic pain
* Fibromyalgia
* Chronic musculoskeletal pain

== Pharmacology ==

=== Route of administration ===

SNRIs are delivered orally, usually in the form of capsules or tablets. It is recommended to take SNRIs in the morning with breakfast, which does not affect drug levels, but may help with certain side effects. Norepinephrine has activating effects in the body and therefore can cause insomnia in some patients if taken at bedtime. SNRIs can also cause nausea, which is usually mild and goes away within a few weeks of treatment, but taking the medication with food can help alleviate this.

=== Mode of action ===
The condition for which SNRIs are mostly indicated, major depressive disorder, was thought to be mainly caused by decreased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, causing erratic signaling. This theory, however, has been refuted. Based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression, which asserts that decreased concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters leads to depressive symptoms, the following relations were determined: &quot;Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life.&quot; SNRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine. This results in increased extracellular concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine and, consequently, an increase in neurotransmission. Most SNRIs including venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine, are several fold more selective for serotonin over norepinephrine, while milnacipran is three times more selective for norepinephrine than serotonin. Elevation of norepinephrine levels is thought to be necessary for an antidepressant to be effective against neuropathic pain, a property shared with the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), but not with the SSRIs.

Recent studies have shown that depression may be linked to increased inflammatory response, thus attempts at finding an additional mechanism for SNRIs have been made. Studies have shown that SNRIs as well as SSRIs have significant anti-inflammatory action on microglia in addition to their effect on serotonin and norepinephrine levels. As such, it is possible that an additional mechanism of these drugs that acts in combination with the previously understood mechanism exist. The implication behind these findings suggests use of SNRIs as potential anti-inflammatories following brain injury or any other disease where swelling of the brain is an issue. However, regardless of the mechanism, the efficacy of these drugs in treating the diseases for which they have been indicated has been proven, both clinically and in practice.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Most SNRIs function alongside primary metabolites and secondary metabolites in order to inhibit reuptake of serotonin, norepinepherine, and marginal amounts of dopamine. For example, venlafaxine works alongside its primary metabolite &quot;O&quot;-desmethylvenlafaxine to strongly inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in the brain. The evidence also suggests that dopamine and norepinephrine behave in a co-transportational manner, due to the inactivation of dopamine by norepinephrine reuptake in the frontal cortex, an area of the brain largely lacking in dopamine transporters. This effect of SNRIs results in increased dopamine neurotransmission, in addition to the increases in serotonin and norepinephrine activity. Furthermore, because SNRIs are extremely selective, they have no measurable effects on other, unintended receptors, in contrast to monoamine oxidase inhibition. Pharmaceutical tests have determined that use of both SNRIs or SSRIs can generate significant anti-inflammatory action on microglia, as well.

====Activity profiles====
=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The half-life of venlafaxine is about 5 hours, and with once-daily dosing, steady-state concentration is achieved after about 3 days, though its active metabolite desvenlafaxine lasts longer. The half-life of desvenlafaxine is about 11 hours, and steady-state concentrations are achieved after 4 to 5 days. The half-life of duloxetine is about 12 hours (range: 8–17 hours), and steady-state is achieved after about 3 days. Milnacipran has a half-life of about 6 to 8 hours, and steady-state levels are reached within 36 to 48 hours.

== Contraindications ==
SNRIs are contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs within the last two weeks due to the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Other drugs and substances that should be avoided due to increased risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with an SNRI include: other anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, analgesics, antiemetic agents, anti-migraine medications, methylene blue, linezolid, Lithium, St. John&#x27;s wort, ecstasy, and LSD. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include: hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with fluctuating vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma.

Due to the effects of increased norepinephrine levels and, therefore, higher noradrenergic activity, pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before treatment with SNRIs and blood pressure periodically monitored throughout treatment. Duloxetine has also been associated with cases of liver failure and should not be prescribed to patients with chronic alcohol use or liver disease. Studies have found that Duloxetine can increase liver function tests three times above their upper normal limit. Patients with coronary artery disease should caution the use of SNRIs. Furthermore, due to some SNRIs&#x27; actions on obesity, patients with major eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia should not be prescribed SNRIs. Duloxetine and milnacipran are also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, as they have been shown to increase incidence of mydriasis.

SNRIs should not be used to treat depressive episodes in Bipolar disorder I and should only be used to treat depression in Bipolar disorder II with caution and accompagnied by mood stabilizers to avoid hypomania.

== Side effects ==
Because the SNRIs and SSRIs act in similar ways to elevate serotonin levels, they share many side effects, though to varying degrees. The most common side effects include nausea/vomiting, sweating, loss of appetite, dizziness, headache, increase in suicidal thoughts, and sexual dysfunction. Elevation of norepinephrine levels can sometimes cause anxiety, mildly elevated pulse, and elevated blood pressure. However, norepinephrine-selective antidepressants, such as reboxetine and desipramine, have successfully treated anxiety disorders. People at risk for hypertension and heart disease should monitor their blood pressure.

=== Sexual Dysfunction ===
SNRIs, similarly to SSRIs, can cause several types of sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, sexual anhedonia, and anorgasmia. The two common sexual side effects are diminished interest in sex (libido) and difficulty reaching climax (anorgasmia), which are usually somewhat milder with SNRIs compared to SSRIs. To manage sexual dysfunction, studies have shown that switching to or augmenting with bupropion or adding a PDE5 Inhibitor have decreased symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Studies have shown that PDE5 Inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil (Stendra), have sometimes been helpful to decrease the sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, although they have been shown to be more effective in men than women.

=== Serotonin Syndrome ===
A serious, but rare, side effect of SNRIs is serotonin syndrome, which is caused by an excess of serotonin in the body. Serotonin syndrome can be caused by taking multiple serotonergic drugs, such as SSRIs or SNRIs. Other drugs that contribute to serotonin syndrome include MAO inhibitors, linezolid, tedizolid, methylene blue, procarbazine, amphetamines, clomipramine, and more. Early symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, agitation, confusion, muscle rigidity, dilated pupils, hyperthermia, rigidity, and goose bumps. More severe symptoms include fever, seizures, irregular heartbeat, delirium, and coma. If signs or symptoms arise, discontinue treatment with serotonergic agents immediately. It is recommended to washout 4 to 5 half-lives of the serotonergic agent before using an MAO inhibitor.

=== Bleeding ===
Some studies suggest there are risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, especially venlafaxine, due to impairment of platelet aggregation and depletion of platelet serotonin levels. Similarly to SSRIs, SNRIs may interact with anticoagulants, like warfarin. There is more evidence of SSRIs having higher risk of bleeding than SNRIs. Studies have suggested caution when using SNRIs or SSRIs with high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen due to an increased risk of upper GI bleeding.

=== Visual problems ===
Similarly to other antidepressants, SNRI medications have been found to cause visual snow syndrome, a condition characterized by visual static, palinopsia (negative after image), nyctalopia (poor vision at night), and photophobia (brighter presentation of lights or highlighted colors). Evidence shows that 8.9% of those taking SNRIs experienced visual snow, 10.5% experienced palinopsia, 15.3% experienced photophobia, and 17.7% experienced nyctolopia as the result of SNRI prescription intake. Amitriptyline, and citalopram have also been reported to worsen or cause symptoms of VSS.

== Precautions ==

=== Starting an SNRI regimen ===
Due to the extreme changes in noradrenergic activity produced from norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, patients that are just starting an SNRI regimen are usually given lower doses than their expected final dosing to allow the body to acclimate to the drug&#x27;s effects. As the patient continues along at low doses without any side-effects, the dose is incrementally increased until the patient sees improvement in symptoms without detrimental side-effects.

=== Discontinuation syndrome ===
As with SSRIs, the abrupt discontinuation of an SNRI usually leads to withdrawal, or &quot;discontinuation syndrome&quot;, which could include states of anxiety and other symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that users seeking to discontinue an SNRI slowly taper the dose under the supervision of a professional. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported to be markedly worse for venlafaxine when compared to other SNRIs. As such, as tramadol is related to venlafaxine, the same conditions apply. This is likely due to venlafaxine&#x27;s relatively short half-life and therefore rapid clearance upon discontinuation. In some cases, switching from venlafaxine to fluoxetine, a long-acting SSRI, and then tapering off fluoxetine, may be recommended to reduce discontinuation symptoms. Signs and symptoms of withdrawal from abrupt cessation of an SNRI include dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, sweating, and flu-like symptoms, such as lethargy and malaise.

== Overdose ==

=== Causes ===
Overdosing on SNRIs can be caused by either drug combinations or excessive amounts of the drug itself. Venlafaxine is marginally more toxic in overdose than duloxetine or the SSRIs.

=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms of SNRI overdose, whether it be a mixed drug interaction or the drug alone, vary in intensity and incidence based on the amount of medicine taken and the individuals sensitivity to SNRI treatment. Possible symptoms may include:
* Somnolence
* Coma
* Serotonin syndrome
* Seizures
* Syncope
* Tachycardia
* Hypotension
* Hypertension
* Hyperthermia
* Vomiting

=== Management ===
Overdose is usually treated symptomatically, especially in the case of serotonin syndrome, which requires treatment with cyproheptadine and temperature control based on the progression of the serotonin toxicity. Patients are often monitored for vitals and airways cleared to ensure that they are receiving adequate levels of oxygen. Another option is to use activated carbon in the GI tract in order to absorb excess neurotransmitter.

== Comparison to SSRIs ==
Because SNRIs were developed more recently than SSRIs, there are relatively few of them. However, the SNRIs are among the most widely used antidepressants today. In 2009, Cymbalta and Effexor were the 11th- and 12th-most-prescribed branded drugs in the United States, respectively. This translates to the 2nd- and 3rd-most-common antidepressants, behind Lexapro (escitalopram), an SSRI.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI/Verispan, VONA, full year 2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some studies, SNRIs demonstrated slightly higher antidepressant efficacy than the SSRIs (response rates 63.6% versus 59.3%). However, in one study escitalopram had a superior efficacy profile to venlafaxine.

== Special populations ==

=== Pregnancy ===
No antidepressants are FDA approved during pregnancy. Use of antidepressants during pregnancy may result in fetus abnormalities affecting functional development of the brain and behavior. Studies have shown correlations between pregnant women treated with SNRIs and risk of hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia, miscarriage, seizures in children, and many other adverse affects.

=== Pediatrics ===
SSRIs and SNRIs have been shown to be effective in treating major depressive disorder and anxiety in pediatric populations. However, differences in metabolism, renal function, and total percentage of body water and body fat can influence the pharmacokinetics of medications in youths as compared to adults. Additionally, there is a risk of increased suicidality in pediatric populations for treatment of major depressive disorder, especially with venlafaxine. Fluoxetine and Escitalopram are the only antidepressants that are approved for child/adolescent major depressive disorder. A literature review by Castagna, et. al from 2023 shows indications of efficacy treating pediatric generalized anxiety disorder. Currently, Duloxetine, an SNRI, is the only FDA-approved medication for pediatric GAD, despite the fact that SSRIs are typically first-line treatment. It is suggested that these medications be combined with psychotherapy to maximize effectiveness.

=== Geriatrics ===
Most antidepressants, including SNRIs, are safe and effective in the geriatric population. The geriatric population is at greater risk for adverse effects relating to drug interaction as they are more likely to experience polypharmacy. Decisions are often based on co-morbid conditions, drug interactions, and patient tolerance. Due to differences in body composition and metabolism, starting doses are often half that of the recommended dose for younger adults. Studies show that these factors also put the geriatric population at increased risk of adverse effects when treated with SNRIs but not with SSRIs.

== Research ==
A systematic review that looked at the efficacy of antidepressants for pain relief concludes that only 11 of 42 comparisons showed evidence of efficacy. Seven of the eleven comparisons belong to the SNRI drug class.

<text>Geoffrey Ridel (died August 1189) was the nineteenth Lord Chancellor of England, from 1162 to 1173.

Ridel was probably the great-nephew of Geoffrey Ridel, who died in 1120 and was a royal justice. He was a royal clerk by about 1156, when he first started witnessing charters. He was a king&#x27;s clerk before he was Archdeacon of Canterbury, which office he held by March 1163. He performed the duties of the chancellor&#x27;s office after Thomas Becket resigned the office, but no documents explicitly name him to the office. He also served as a royal judge. By 1165, Ridel was a baron of the Exchequer.

During the controversy between King Henry II of England and Archbishop Thomas Becket, Ridel supported the king. Ridel was one of the persons whom the Constitutions of Clarendon were addressed to, along with Richard de Luci and Richard of Ilchester. Ridel went to Rome in 1164 to represent the king before the papal curia, and in 1166 opposed Becket once more. By 1169 he was urging King Louis VII of France to no longer give refuge to Becket. Becket&#x27;s supporters called Ridel the &quot;archidiabolus&quot;, or &quot;our archdevil&quot;, a play on the office of archdeacon which Ridel held. Ridel also urged King Henry&#x27;s son, Henry the Young King, to refuse to see the archbishop in 1170, telling the prince that Becket wished to disinherit the prince.

After the controversy was resolved, Ridel was rewarded with a bishopric. He was elected to the see of Ely in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury. For several years previous to his election he had been the custodian of the see and had received the episcopal revenues. He resigned the chancellorship when he became a bishop. He continued to be involved in governmental affairs, attending councils and escorting King Henry II&#x27;s daughter Joanna to Provence when the princess was sent to Sicily to marry King William II of Sicily. He also continued to hold the office of baron of the exchequer at least as late as 1185.

Ridel died on either 20 or 21 August 1189. After his death, King Richard I of England confiscated his personal property, because Geoffrey had died without a will. The bishop&#x27;s estate at his death included over 3000 marks in coins, as well as agricultural supplies and gold and silver plate. He was buried in Ely Cathedral. During his time as bishop, he built much of the western transept of Ely Cathedral.

<text>Horchata (; ), or  (), is a name given to various beverages, which are generally plant based, but sometimes contain milk. In Spain, it is made with soaked, ground, and sweetened tiger nuts. In some parts of the Americas it is known as an agua fresca, and the base can be either jicaro (morro), melon seeds, sesame seeds, or white rice, along with spices.

==Etymology==
The name probably derives from a Latin word for barley, the term , which in turn comes from (barley), related to a Mediterranean tradition of grain-based beverages. The Italian and Maltese , the French and English &quot;orgeat&quot; have the same origin, although the beverages themselves have diverged, and are generally no longer made from barley.

==History and composition==

A drink made of out of tiger nuts was brought to Spain by Arab Moors during their Iberian occupation, and it is estimated that during the 11th century, it began to spread throughout Hispania (now Spain and Portugal). There are 13th-century records of an -like beverage made near Valencia, where it remains a common drink.

From Spain, the concept of horchata was brought to the New World. Drinks called or simply came to be made with white rice and cinnamon or instead of tiger nuts. Sometimes these drinks had vanilla added, or were served adorned with fruit. Similarly flavored plant based beverages are sold in various parts of the world as varieties of or .

The Valencian or is made with dried and sweetened tiger nuts (&quot;Cyperus esculentus&quot;). This form of horchata is now properly called .

It remains popular in Spain, where a regulating council exists to ensure the quality and traceability of the product in relation to the designation of origin.

The majority of the Spanish tiger nut crop is utilised in the production of . Alboraya is the most important production centre. In total, sixteen Valencian municipalities grow tiger nuts protected by the quality seal, the only one that guarantees its Valencian origin, which in aggregate cover around 485 hectares of tiger nut fields, with an approximate annual production of 8,000 tonnes, which is normally all sold by the time it is harvested.

In rare instances, various forms of aflatoxin may be present in .

===Horchata de morro or ===
In the Central American countries of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica, refers to the drink known as horchata de morro or . Its base is made by grinding jicaro seeds, locally referred to as &quot;morro&quot; seeds, with rice. Depending on the region, other additions include ground cocoa, cinnamon, sesame seeds, nutmeg, tiger nuts, vanilla, ground peanuts, almonds and cashews.

In Nicaragua, it is also made with semilla de jicaro and rice as a base; these ingredients are toasted or dry-roasted, then ground into a fine powder. The powder is then mixed with water or milk, topped with ground cinnamon and, finally, sugar. Cocoa beans are sometimes added to the horchata, also toasted and ground with the base.

<doc id="625653" wikidata="Q292068" url="?curid=625653" title="M4 (computer language)">
<text>m4 is a general-purpose macro processor included in most Unix-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard.

The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor, m3, written by Ritchie for an unknown AP-3 minicomputer.

The macro preprocessor operates as a text-replacement tool. It is employed to re-use text templates, typically in computer programming applications, but also in text editing and text-processing applications. Most users require m4 as a dependency of GNU autoconf and GNU Bison.

==History==

Macro processors became popular when programmers commonly used assembly language. In those early days of programming, programmers noted that much of their programs consisted of repeated text, and they invented simple means for reusing this text. Programmers soon discovered the advantages not only of reusing entire blocks of text, but also of substituting different values for similar parameters. This defined the usage range of macro processors at the time.

In the 1960s, an early general-purpose macro processor, M6, was in use at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, which was developed by Douglas McIlroy, Robert Morris and Andrew Hall.

Kernighan and Ritchie developed m4 in 1977, basing it on the ideas of Christopher Strachey. The distinguishing features of this style of macro preprocessing included:
* free-form syntax (not line-based like a typical macro preprocessor designed for assembly-language processing)
* the high degree of re-expansion (a macro&#x27;s arguments get expanded twice: once during scanning and once at interpretation time)

The implementation of Rational Fortran used m4 as its macro engine from the beginning, and most Unix variants ship with it.

 many applications continue to use m4 as part of the GNU Project&#x27;s autoconf. It also appears in the configuration process of sendmail (a widespread mail transfer agent) and for generating footprints in the gEDA toolsuite. The SELinux Reference Policy relies heavily on the m4 macro processor.

m4 has many uses in code generation, but (as with any macro processor) problems can be hard to debug.

==Features==
m4 offers these facilities:

* a free-form syntax, rather than line-based syntax
* a high degree of macro expansion (arguments get expanded during scan and again during interpretation)
* text replacement
* parameter substitution
* file inclusion
* string manipulation
* conditional evaluation
* arithmetic expressions
* system interface
* programmer diagnostics
* programming language independent
* human language independent
* provides programming language capabilities

Unlike most earlier macro processors, m4 does not target any particular computer or human language; historically, however, its development originated for supporting the Ratfor dialect of Fortran. Unlike some other macro processors, m4 is Turing-complete as well as a practical programming language.

Unquoted identifiers which match defined macros are replaced with their definitions. Placing identifiers in quotes suppresses expansion until possibly later, such as when a quoted string is expanded as part of macro replacement. Unlike most languages, strings in m4 are quoted using the backtick (`) as the starting delimiter, and apostrophe (&#x27;) as the ending delimiter. Separate starting and ending delimiters allows the arbitrary nesting of quotation marks in strings to be used, allowing a fine degree of control of how and when macro expansion takes place in different parts of a string.

==Example==
The following fragment gives a simple example that could form part of a library for generating HTML code. It defines a commented macro to number sections automatically:
divert(-1)

m4 has multiple output queues that can be manipulated with the
`divert&#x27; macro. Valid queues range from 0 to 10, inclusive, with
the default queue being 0. As an extension, GNU m4 supports more
diversions, limited only by integer type size.

Calling the `divert&#x27; macro with an invalid queue causes text to be
discarded until another call. Note that even while output is being
discarded, quotes around `divert&#x27; and other macros are needed to
prevent expansion.

# Macros aren&#x27;t expanded within comments, meaning that keywords such
# as divert and other built-ins may be used without consequence.

# HTML utility macro:

define(`H2_COUNT&#x27;, 0)

# The H2_COUNT macro is redefined every time the H2 macro is used:

define(`H2&#x27;,
 `define(`H2_COUNT&#x27;, incr(H2_COUNT))&lt;h2&gt;H2_COUNT. $1&lt;/h2&gt;&#x27;)

divert(1)dnl
dnl
dnl The dnl macro causes m4 to discard the rest of the line, thus
dnl preventing unwanted blank lines from appearing in the output.
dnl
H2(First Section)
H2(Second Section)
H2(Conclusion)
dnl
divert(0)dnl
dnl
&lt;HTML&gt;
undivert(1)dnl One of the queues is being pushed to output.
&lt;/HTML&gt;
Processing this code with m4 generates the following text:
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. First Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Second Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
==Implementations==
FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD provide independent implementations of the m4 language. Furthermore, the Heirloom Project Development Tools includes a free version of the m4 language, derived from OpenSolaris.

M4 has been included in the Inferno operating system. This implementation is more closely related to the original m4 developed by Kernighan and Ritchie in Version 7 Unix than its more sophisticated relatives in UNIX System V and POSIX.

&quot;GNU m4&quot; is an implementation of m4 for the GNU Project. It is designed to avoid many kinds of arbitrary limits found in traditional m4 implementations, such as maximum line lengths, maximum size of a macro and number of macros. Removing such arbitrary limits is one of the stated goals of the GNU Project.

The GNU Autoconf package makes extensive use of the features of GNU m4.

GNU m4 is currently maintained by Gary V. Vaughan and Eric Blake. GNU m4 is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

<doc id="625658" wikidata="Q4121835" url="?curid=625658" title="Last prophet">
<text>The last prophet, or final prophet, is a term used in religious contexts, especially in the Abrahamic religions, to refer to the last person through whom God or several gods speak, after which there is to be no other. The appellation also refers to the prophet who will induce mankind to turn back to God.

==Abrahamic and ancient Near Eastern religions==

===Judaism===
Judaism considers Malachi to be the last of the biblical prophets.

===Christianity===

In Christianity, the last prophet of the Old Covenant before the arrival of Jesus is John the Baptist (cf. ). The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that Malachi was the &quot;Seal of Prophets&quot; in the Old Testament. Christian denominations who hold that spiritual gifts (including prophecy) continue to be bestowed by the Holy Spirit on Christians are known as &quot;continuationists&quot; (including Catholics, Methodists, and Pentecostals), while the cessationist perspective, which teaches that charismata ended in the Apostolic era, is held by much of Reformed Christianity and Baptists.

===Mandaeism===
In Mandaeism, John the Baptist is the greatest and final prophet.

===Manichaeism===
In Manichaeism, the founder Mani is believed by adherents of the faith to be the last and final prophet after a long succession of religious figures, including Zoroaster, the Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ. According to Al-Biruni, a 10th-century Iranian scholar, Mani claimed to be the &quot;Paraclete&quot; promised in the New Testament and the Last Prophet.

===Islam===
The phrase &quot;Khatamu ’n-Nabiyyīn&quot; (&quot;Seal of the Prophets&quot;) is a title used in the Quran to designate the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is generally regarded to mean that Muhammad is the last of the prophets sent by God. The Holy Quran is the complete code of life for all human beings, and the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is a perfect example for all humanity and the rest of the world to come.

==Indian religions==
===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, the history of mankind is described in four religious (&quot;dharmic&quot;) ages (&quot;yugas&quot;), which depict a gradual decline in religious activities, only to be renewed at the end to start a new cycle of the four ages. At the end of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, the current and last age in a cycle, Kalki, the tenth &quot;avatar&quot; of Vishnu, is prophesied to appear to punish the wicked, reward the good, and inaugurate the &quot;Satya Yuga&quot; of the next cycle. Kalki is the last &quot;avatar&quot; in the current cycle.

<text>Donruss was a US-based trading cards manufacturing company founded in 1954 and acquired by the Panini Group in 2009. The company started in the 1950s, producing confectionery, evolved into Donruss and started producing trading cards. During the 1960s and 1970s Donruss produced entertainment-themed cards. Its first sports theme cards were produced in 1965, when it created a series of racing cards sponsored by &quot;Hot Rod Magazine&quot;.

Its next series of sports products came in 1981, when it produced baseball and golf trading cards. It was one of three manufacturers to produce baseball cards from 1981 through 1985, along with Fleer and Topps. In 1986, Sportflics (Major League Marketing) entered the market as the fourth fully licensed card producer, followed by Score in 1988, and Upper Deck in 1989. Since entering the trading card market, it has produced a variety of sports trading cards, including American football, baseball, basketball, boxing, golf, ice hockey, racing and tennis; and has acquired a number of brand names. In 1996 Donruss was acquired by rival Pinnacle Brands, makers of Score and Sportflix.

Donruss produced baseball cards from 1981 to 1998, when then-parent company Pinnacle Brands filed for bankruptcy. Baseball card production resumed in 2001, when then-parent company Playoff Corporation acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. From 2007 to 2009, Donruss released baseball card products featuring players that were no longer under MLB contract after MLB decided to limit licensing options in 2005.

==Company history==

===1954 to 1998, Donruss===
Douglas Thomas, Donald, and Russel Wiener founded the original Donruss company in 1954. At first, they were the owners of the Thomas Wiener Company located in Memphis, Tennessee. They manufactured hard candy, suckers and Super Bubble gum. Combining their first names, Douglas, Don, and Russ, they renamed their company Donruss and continued to produce candy and gum. Donruss produced several entertainment-themed trading cards, from such television shows as &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot; and &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; from 1961 until 1969.

That same year, Donruss made national news with a $30,000 surtax dispute. Donruss paid its surtax but sued to get the money back. It won in U.S. Circuit Court but lost in U.S. Supreme Court. Donruss claimed its earnings did not pass the &quot;purpose test&quot; to avoid paying the taxes, and having lost it prevented any other corporation from using the purpose test.

Later that year, Donruss was purchased by General Mills. Donruss continued making entertainment-themed cards throughout the 1970s, adding titles like &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, Elvis Presley, Kiss and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; to its product lines. Producing these cards was profitable; however, Donruss, looking for additional avenues of income, desired to enter the baseball card market. Unfortunately, Topps had exclusive rights and Donruss would have to wait until Fleer&#x27;s lawsuit against Topps.

In 1975, Fleer sued Topps over its exclusive baseball rights. After five years a federal judge ruled that Topps illegally obtained Major League Baseball Players Association rights. Donruss and Fleer negotiated deals with Major League Baseball and by late 1980 Donruss had acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. Its first baseball card set was produced and ready in time for the 1981 season. In August of that year, an appellate court overturned the judge&#x27;s ruling. Quick to react, Fleer&#x27;s lawyers found a loophole in Topps&#x27; contract that stated it had exclusive rights to sell baseball cards with gum or candy. So after 1981, Fleer started distributing its baseball cards with stickers, and Donruss started distributing its cards with puzzle pieces.

Overproduction and distribution was an early problem for Donruss. In 1983 Huhtamäki Oyj purchased Beatrice US Confections, Donruss and Leaf Candy Company, merging the three companies into &quot;Leaf, Inc.&quot; The company continued to use the &quot;Donruss&quot; name on baseball cards, which now benefited from Leaf&#x27;s established distribution network. The Leaf brand was used from 1985 through 1988 on specially made baseball cards distributed in Canada, and in 1990 on a premium series of cards distributed in the U.S.

Donruss expanded its Memphis plant from to nearly 400,000, grew from 550 employees to 720 and continued to make trading cards and bubble gum at the facility throughout 1991. In 1992 demand for higher-quality cards rose, and standard card sales dropped. Donruss responded by reducing production, increasing price, upgrading card quality and randomly inserted limited edition and autographed insert cards to its new foil packaged cards. Donruss also partnered with Coca-Cola, Cracker Jack and McDonald&#x27;s to create special card series, and created a less expensive line of cards called &quot;Triple Play&quot; targeted at young collectors.

In 1993 Donruss acquired the rights to produce hockey cards. With poor sales in 1994, due in part to a Major League Baseball strike and National Hockey League lockout, Donruss began producing new lines of entertainment cards, and a football collectible card game under license from NXT Games, in 1995. In 1996, Pinnacle Brands acquired the Donruss/Leaf brands, as well as their baseball and hockey licenses, from Huhtamäki Oyj for about $41 million. The entertainment line was sold to United States Playing Card Company. Pinnacle used the Donruss and Leaf brands on baseball, football and hockey cards.

In July 1998 Pinnacle Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

===1970 to 2001, Playoff Corp.===
Playoff Corp. can be traced back to as early as 1970 with a company called Optigraphics. At the time, Optigraphics specialized in advanced printing technology. Its first sports work was seen in 1983 when 7-Eleven began distributing multiple-image discs utilizing the lenticular printing process which gave an appearance as though the image were moving, or changing –with purchases of Slurpee drinks.

In 1985 the company obtained baseball licenses and started producing its unique style of cards under the name &quot;Sportflics&quot;. This also marked the first time any company used full-color photography on the back of sports cards. Minus &quot;Magic Motion&quot;, but using the same style as its Sportflics cards, it released baseball cards under the Score brand in 1988 and football cards under the Score brand in 1989.

In 1992 founders and owners Ann Blake and John Flavin divorced. Flavin maintained the Score brand. Blake left and founded a new company called Cardz Distribution, which later developed into Playoff Corp. and ultimately gained control of the Score brand, along with Donruss and Leaf, in 1998 when then parent company Pinnacle Brands, Inc. was under bankruptcy. Playoff could not obtain Pinnacle/Donruss&#x27; baseball and hockey licenses, however. Playoff was producing high-end lines of football cards, generating some $25 million in annual revenues. With its Pinnacle Brands purchase, Playoff began producing trading cards under the Donruss Elite, Leaf and Score brand names.

Playoff expanded its business in 2000 by adding a distribution facility, and developed its Score Entertainment subsidiary to produce Dragonball Z trading cards.

===1988 to 1997, Action Packed===
Action Packed manufactured trading cards from 1988 to 1997. Complete sets consisted of few cards to keep collectors happy when opening packages. Action Packed created a six-card embossed set in 1988 to show its technique to Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was not awarded a license. Action packed created a single set of basketball cards in 1995, produced football cards from 1990 to 1997, produced hockey cards in 1993 and 1995, produced racing cards in 1990 and from 1992 to 1997, and World Wrestling Federation cards in 1994 and 1995.

Pinnacle Brands acquired the brand in 1995.

===2001 to 2009, Donruss Playoff L.P.===
In 2001 Playoff Corp. became Donruss Playoff L.P., acquired the rights to produce baseball cards and established its headquarters in Arlington, Texas.

Donruss Playoff expanded its entertainment lines in 2002, with such trading cards as &quot;Buffy, The Vampire Slayer&quot; through its new Score Entertainment division. Donruss also produced the first Spanish-only baseball card set.

In 2003, Donruss Playoff stirred up controversy when it paid $264,210 at auction for a rare game-worn Babe Ruth jersey, which it then cut up and turned into 2,100 memorabilia cards.

In 2004, Donruss Playoff acquired the rights to Pacific Trading Cards, Inc., a Lynnwood, Washington—based company, that had a major impact on sports cards in the mid-1990s and early 2000s.
From 2007 to 2009, Donruss has released baseball card products featuring players that are no longer under MLB contract.

===2009 and beyond===
On March 13, 2009, Panini s.p.a. of Italy (which had previously acquired the exclusive license to produce NBA trading cards beginning with the 2009–10 season), announced that it had purchased Donruss Playoff. Effective immediately, the company was renamed Panini America, Inc. However, the company continued to operate out of Irving, Texas, with much of the existing upper management.

During the 2010 Industry Summit Collectibles (a gathering where retailers can meet leaders in the trading cards industry, and listen to discussions about card collecting), held in Las Vegas on April 11, Panini America announced changes to the company&#x27;s distribution network. Only retail stores would be authorized to sell Panini products directly to consumers, and any retailer attempting to wholesale would lose its authorization. Only wholesalers would be authorized to sell Panini products directly to retailers, and any wholesaler attempting to retail would lose its authorization.

Panini also outlined other initiatives: that they will continue to destroy returned NBA trading cards to protect &quot;collectibility&quot;, willing to implement minimum advertised price if needed, formation of a brick-and-mortar standards committee, upgraded ordering systems and schedules, new football and hockey trading cards and other products featuring autographs and memorabilia swatches from sports, history and pop culture.

==Baseball cards==

===1981 to 1989===

In late 1980, on the heels of a court ruling in favor of Fleer that voided Topps&#x27; exclusivity deal, Donruss rushed into production a 605-card set for the 1981 season. The first printings were riddled with errors (though Fleer&#x27;s first set was even worse in this regard), most of which were fixed in subsequent runs. They were also printed on flimsy card stock and there were no factory sets; rather, the cards were shipped to dealers in 100-count lots and were then collated by hand. TCMA of Amawalk, New York handled dealer business. TV personality Keith Olbermann was a photographer for some of the cards that were part of the 1981 Donruss set.

With an entire offseason to prepare, Donruss shipped a much improved, more polished set for 1982. The 1982 offering also saw the introduction of the Diamond Kings, the first 26 cards of the 660-card set, made up of oil paintings by noted sports artist Dick Perez. An appeal of the 1978 Fleer v. Topps ruling in 1981 barred the two new card companies from using gum premiums; Fleer switched to team logo stickers in 1982, while Donruss included jigsaw puzzle pieces with a pack of cards. Babe Ruth was pictured as &quot;Hall of Fame Diamond King&quot; when the 63-piece puzzle was assembled. Donruss also began selling to dealers directly, the first of the major card companies to offer factory sets for those buying in bulk. Notable card in this set is Cal Ripken&#x27;s rookie card.

Donruss released three baseball card sets in 1983. Its standard 660-card set (with only minimal changes; a glove replacing the ball on the front and the back switching from blue to yellow), a 60-card &quot;Action All-Star&quot; set and a 44-card &quot;Hall of Fame Heroes&quot; set. &quot;Action All-Star&quot; were not the standard 2½&quot; by 3½&quot; card size, rather 3½&quot; by 5&quot; and included a 63-piece Mickey Mantle puzzle (eight cards per pack and three pieces on one card per pack). The &quot;Hall of Fame Heroes&quot; set were standard sized cards issued in the same packs as the &quot;Action All-Star&quot; cards, but rather than picturing photographs of the players Donruss used its Diamond King style and showed Dick Perez oil paintings. Notable rookie cards in their standard set include Ryne Sandberg, Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs. Another card of note is an error card of Ron Jackson where Donruss claimed he played for the A&#x27;s rather than the Angels. Donruss did issue a card to correct the error. That year&#x27;s jigsaw puzzle inserted in wax packs featured Ty Cobb.

The 1984 660-card base set was among the company&#x27;s most successful; however, only 658 are numbered. A new feature introduced that year were two &quot;Living Legend&quot; cards designated A (featuring Gaylord Perry and Rollie Fingers) and B (featuring Johnny Bench and Carl Yastrzemski). These were issued as bonus cards in wax packs but not issued in the factory set. Another new feature among the base set were labeling cards 27 through 46 as &quot;Rated Rookies&quot; chosen by Bill Madden. The 1984 jigsaw puzzle inserted in wax packs was Duke Snider. A notable card in this set is Don Mattingly&#x27;s rookie card. Donruss, again, produced the 60-card &quot;Action All-Star&quot; set, with the year&#x27;s 63-piece puzzle featuring Ted Williams, and created another 3½&quot; by 5&quot; 60-card set called &quot;Champions&quot;. The &quot;Champions&quot; featured the artwork of Dick Perez and were issued in cello packs along with pieces of the Duke Snider puzzle.

Donruss released six baseball card sets in 1985. The standard 660-card set, 60-card &quot;Action All-Stars&quot;, 56-card &quot;Highlights&quot;, 8-card &quot;Hall of Fame Sluggers&quot;, 28-card &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; and 263-card &quot;Leaf&quot; set. The standard set contained the previous year&#x27;s features; the first 26 cards are Diamond Kings with artwork by Perez-Steele Galleries and cards 27 through 46 as Rated Rookies. Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces were inserted in the year&#x27;s wax packs. A notable card in this set is Roger Clemens&#x27; rookie card. The wax boxes, which held the wax packs, of the standard issue set featured four standard-size cards, styled the same as the standard set, on the bottom of the box and are numbered with a PC prefix.

&quot;Action All-Stars&quot; measured the usual 3½&quot; by 5&quot;, but rather than using a different puzzle for this set Donruss issued the standard set&#x27;s Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces with the cards. The &quot;Highlights&quot; set, as the name would suggest, features 54 highlights of players and pitchers of the month for the American League and National League. The final two cards of the set were devoted to American League and National League Rookies of the Year chosen by Donruss. Dick Perez provided the artwork for the 3½&quot; by 6½&quot; &quot;Hall of Fame Sluggers&quot; set. Players for this set were chosen by their career slugging percentage, and the cards are numbered by the percentages. This is the first and last time Donruss would make this type of set. The &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; are enlarged, measuring approximately 4 15/16 by 6¾&quot;, versions of the first 26 cards of the standard set, and were obtained through mail-order. The other two cards featured a checklist card and one of artist Dick Perez. A Lou Gehrig puzzle piece was also included in the mail-order.

Donruss produced a &quot;Leaf&quot; set to establish themselves in the Canadian baseball card market along with rival Topps&#x27; affiliate O-Pee-Chee. These cards are similar in appearance to the standard set, but are numbered differently and the backs are in both French and English. Card numbers 251 and 252 feature Dick Perez artwork of Dave Stieb and Tim Raines, respectively, and are not found in the standard set. Wax packs of this set also contained Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces. Donruss released this set at a later date in the U.S.
Donruss&#x27; 1986 baseball card sets didn&#x27;t deviate much from 1985. The standard 660-card set featured Hank Aaron puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs. Again, Donruss issued cards on the bottom of wax boxes. The 60-card &quot;Action All-Stars&quot; changed slightly. The set was now called &quot;All-Stars&quot; and featured players that were involved in the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Cards were very similar to the standard set, and backs of the cards displayed each players All-Star game statistics. Similar to the 1985 and 1986 wax boxes, the All-Star Boxes featured four standard-size cards, styled the same as the standard set, on the bottom of the box. The 56-card &quot;Highlights&quot; set were given a glossy-coating on the front side of the card. Again, the &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; set was available by mail-order and is an enlarged versions of the regular set. This year&#x27;s set featured an extra card, however. Card 27 is Pete Rose &quot;King of Kings&quot;. The other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no numbered card depicting the complete Hank Aaron jigsaw puzzle. The 264-card &quot;Leaf&quot; set had the same differences as the previous year&#x27;s set. However, this year card numbers 214 and 254 feature Dick Perez artwork of Jeff Reardon and Jesse Barfield, respectively, and are not found in the standard set.

Two new sets were introduced in 1986. 18-card &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; and 56-card &quot;Rookies&quot;. The &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; measured 2½&quot; by 5&quot; and features the first 18 players of the &quot;All-Star&quot; set. The cards were die-cut and folded in a manner that when we unfolded, or &quot;popped up&quot;, could stand on its own and give the appearance of a player in action in front of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome ballpark background. For the cards to remain in mint condition, card collecting guides recommend not unfolding the cards. The &quot;Rookies&quot; were issued in factory set form and came with 15-piece jigsaw puzzle of Hank Aaron.

All of the 1986 sets were used again in 1987, with a few differences. The standard set put a checklist card at #27, so the Rated Rookie cards now occupied 28 through 47. Roberto Clemente debuted as the jigsaw puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs, and the 1987 factory sets contained a complete puzzle set. Perez-Steele Galleries started using repeats of the Diamond King (1-26) sections, to avoid depleting their limited pool of available players. There was no change to the &quot;All-Stars&quot; set. 1987 marked the last year Donruss issued cards on the bottom of the regular set and &quot;All-Stars&quot; boxes, and the last year Donruss released a &quot;Highlights&quot; set. &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; increased from an 18-card to 20-card set. &quot;Rookies&quot; replaced the previous year&#x27;s 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Roberto Clemente. &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; decreased from a 29-card set to a 28-card set, excluding card 27 this time. Again, the other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no numbered card depicting the complete Roberto Clemente jigsaw puzzle. The year&#x27;s &quot;Leaf&quot; set featured artwork by Dick Perez on card numbers 65 and 173, Floyd Youmans and Mark Eichhorn, respectively. Again, those cards were not in the U.S. set. 1987 was the last year Donruss released enlarged versions of the &quot;All-Stars&quot; and &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; sets.

Donruss introduced one new 272-card set for the year called &quot;Opening Day&quot;. The set featured a card for every player in the starting line up on Opening Day. Like the &quot;Rookies&quot; set, the &quot;Opening Day&quot; set contained a 15-piece jigsaw puzzle of Roberto Clemente. A notable card in this set is a Barry Bonds&#x27; error card with Johnny Ray pictured instead of Bonds. Donruss did issue a card to correct the error. 1987 was the only year Donruss issued an &quot;Opening Day&quot; set.

In 1988 Donruss started distributing a new set within its standard 660-card set. In addition to finding the usual jigsaw puzzle piece, the year&#x27;s being Stan Musial, bonus cards, numbered with a BC prefix, were randomly inserted into wax packs. These cards had an MVP logo on the face of the card to distinguish them from the regular set; and created a new 26-card &quot;Bonus MVP&quot; set, featuring the most valuable player from each Major League Baseball team. This did, however, create a problem for both sets. Rather than producing extra packaging materials to ship the extra cards, Donruss pulled cards from both sets to make room. This meant 26 cards from the regular set were in shorter print, cards 648 through 660 more so than the other thirteen; and cards BC14 through BC26 were in shorter print from the &quot;Bonus MVP&quot; set. The short printed cards did not have a significant effect on the cards values.

Also new to 1988 is a 336-card set called &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best&quot; and 27-card &quot;Team Books&quot; of the A&#x27;s, Cubs, Mets, Red Sox and Yankees. &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best&quot; was issued late in the season and sold in big-box stores as a complete factory set. Six 15-piece jigsaw puzzles of Stan Musial are included in every factory set. Each &quot;Team Book&quot; was issued with 27-cards (3 pages with 9 cards) and a large, perforated full-page puzzle of Stan Musial. These cards are identical to the standard set cards, but copyrighted 1988 rather than 1987, distinguishing the cards from the regular set. Donruss did not issue &quot;Team Books&quot; again.

Donruss produced their &quot;All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Pop-Ups&quot;, &quot;Rookies&quot;, &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; and &quot;Leaf&quot; sets again in 1988 with a few differences. Previous years &quot;All-Stars&quot; and &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; enlarged sets were now produced in the standard 2½&quot; by 3½&quot; card size. &quot;All-Stars&quot; increased from a 60-card set to a 64-card set. No other changes to the &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; set. The &quot;Rookies&quot; set replaced this year&#x27;s 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Stan Musial. Donruss did not include extra cards in &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot;, making this a 26-card set. Dick Perez artwork is used, again, in the &quot;Leaf&quot; set on two cards, George Bell (213) and Tim Wallach (255), which were not issued in the U.S. set. Two &quot;Bonus MVP&quot; cards, Tim Raines (211) and George Bell (214), were issued in both the Canadian and U.S. versions of the &quot;Leaf&quot; set. 1988 was also the last year Donruss issued a &quot;Leaf&quot; set produced specifically for a Canadian, and later U.S., release.

Donruss released many of the same sets in 1989, and three new sets. The base set remained 660-cards. Again, Donruss released &quot;Bonus MVP&quot; cards randomly inserted into regular set wax packs, along with a jigsaw puzzle piece of Warren Spahn. Donruss did not short print any cards this year. The factory set contained 672-cards. A 12-card &quot;Grand Slammers&quot; set accompanies the regular 660-card set as an added incentive to purchase a factory set. The &quot;Grand Slammers&quot; set contained players who hit one or more grand slams in 1988. &quot;Grand Slammers&quot; were also found in cellophane-wrapped packaged (cello pack) cards.

The other new sets for 1989 were a 12-card &quot;Blue Chips&quot; and a 56-card &quot;Traded&quot; set. The 12-card &quot;Blue Chips&quot; set is identical to the &quot;Grand Slammers&quot; set, except in the place of the &quot;Grand Slammers&quot; logo is a &quot;Blue Chips&quot; logo with a Donruss or Leaf trademark. These cards were not issued in factory sets, and are not commonly found among collectors. The &quot;Traded&quot; set was issued in factory form, featured players that traded teams and card numbers began with a T prefix. 1989 was the first and last time &quot;Blue Chips&quot; and &quot;Traded&quot; sets were produced.

&quot;All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best&quot;, &quot;Pop-Ups&quot;, &quot;Rookies&quot; and &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; were produced again in 1989, with a few items of note. No changes to the &quot;All-Stars&quot; set, but Donruss would not make this particular set again until 1995. Once again, &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best&quot; was sold in big-box stores as a complete factory set. Notable card in this set is Sammy Sosa, Donruss was the only company to release a licensed major league baseball card of him in 1989. Donruss would not produce a &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Best&quot; set again until 2001. &quot;Pop-Ups&quot; increased from a 20-card to 42-card set, and was the last year Donruss produced the set. The &quot;Rookies&quot; set replaced the year&#x27;s 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Warren Spahn. There were no changes to the &quot;Super Diamond Kings&quot; set.

===Increased competition and market saturation===
Throughout the 1980s, the baseball card market boomed, with new collectors getting into the hobby as well as speculators hoarding cards in hopes of selling them off later for a tidy profit. Unfortunately, as the &quot;Big Three&quot; ramped up their production numbers, new brands like Sportflics, Score and Upper Deck crowded the marketplace.

Donruss baseball cards were produced continuously from 1981 to 1998, when its then-parent Pinnacle Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Playoff Inc. then purchased the Donruss name and produced Major League Baseball sets again from 2001 to 2005, when Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association revoked the company&#x27;s production license. It also produced NHL hockey cards from 1992 until 1998, and NFL football cards since 1996. Today, Donruss Playoff LP produces NFL football cards and NBA basketball cards, along with a line of baseball draft picks products and entertainment cards.

===End of an era===
In the late summer of 2005, Major League Baseball created new license criteria for cardmakers in response to collectors&#x27; complaints that the market had become too fragmented and confusing; and that rookie cards were becoming too scarce, with diminished importance due to the race between makers to feature unknown players first. MLB chose to renew only its licenses with Topps and Upper Deck, tacitly sealing the fate of Donruss and Fleer. The last MLB-licensed baseball product shipped by the company was the third series of the Playoff-branded Prime Cuts memorabilia cards.

In late 2007 however, Donruss did release Donruss Elite Extra Edition, which is its first product outside of the NFL. This product was a multisport release that included cards of the top 30 picks in the 2007 MLB Amateur Draft. Since this product was not licensed by Major League Baseball, the players from the 2007 MLB Amateur Draft were pictured in their high school or college uniforms and existing Minor Leaguers had their uniforms airbrushed to remove all marks. In addition, there are a number of collegiate themed cards as well as soccer themes.

In October 2008, Donruss released Donruss Threads Baseball, featuring a balance of Hall of Famers and young stars. Again, players were either featured in their high school/college uniforms or were photographed so as to make the team logo not visible. The cards also included only the city of the ballplayer, with no mention of the team associated. Donruss used its advantage of not having an MLB license to include baseball cards of both Joe Jackson and Pete Rose, who were banned from baseball for allegedly throwing the World Series in the Black Sox Scandal and betting on the game, respectively. The product included game-used bat cards for Jackson as well as autographed and memorabilia cards from Rose.

In 2011, Panini revived the Donruss Baseball line with cards that are licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, but not MLB, which omit team names, identifying them solely by cities, and airbrushing out team logos and word marks from photos.

<text>The Global Warming Petition Project, also known as the Oregon Petition, is a group which urges the United States government to reject the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and similar policies. Their petition challenges the scientific consensus on climate change. Though the group claims more than thirty-thousand signatories across various scientific fields, the authenticity and methods of the petitioners as well as the signatories&#x27; credentials have been questioned, and the project has been characterized as a disinformation campaign engaged in climate change denial.

==History and signatories==
The petition was organized and circulated by Arthur B. Robinson, president of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (described as &quot;a small independent research group&quot;) in 1998, and again in 2007. Frederick Seitz, then chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute, wrote a supporting cover letter, signed as &quot;Past President National Academy of Sciences USA, President Emeritus Rockefeller University&quot;. &quot;In a highly unusual move, the National Academy held a press conference to disclaim the mailing and distance itself from its former president.&quot;

Robinson asserted in 2008 that the petition has over 31,000 signatories, with 9,000 of these holding a PhD degree. Most signatories with a PhD hold their degree in engineering. The 2009 report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)—a group that &quot;disputes the reality of man-made climate change&quot;—lists 31,478 degreed signatories, including 9,029 with PhDs. The list has been criticized for its lack of verification, with pranksters successfully submitting the names of Charles Darwin, a member of the Spice Girls and characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and getting them briefly included on the list.

==Petition text==
The text of the Global Warming Petition Project reads, in its entirety:We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth&#x27;s climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.Along with the cover letter from Seitz (see above), the petition was circulated with a manuscript plus a reprint of a December 1997 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed (&quot;Science Has Spoken: Global Warming Is a Myth&quot;) by Arthur and Zachary Robinson. The current version of Seitz&#x27;s letter describes the summary as &quot;a twelve page review of information on the subject of &#x27;global warming&#x27;.&quot; The article is titled &quot;Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide&quot; by Arthur B. Robinson, Noah E. Robinson, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon.

As of October 2007, the petition project website includes an article by Arthur Robinson, Noah E. Robinson and Willie Soon, published in 2007 in the &quot;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&quot;. The publication, which is not indexed alongside peer-reviewed journals, is the outlet of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is a libertarian political organization, and is associated with the Oregon Institute, which sponsored the petition.

==Signatories==
The Oregon Petition Project clarified their verification process as follows:
*The petitioners could submit responses only by physical mail, not electronic mail, to limit fraud. Older signatures submitted via the web were not removed. The verification of the scientists was listed at 95%, but the means by which this verification was done was not specified.
*Signatories to the petition were requested to list an academic degree. The petition sponsors stated that approximately two thirds held higher degrees. As of 2013, the petition&#x27;s website states, &quot;The current list of 31,487 petition signers includes 9,029 PhD; 7,157 MS; 2,586 MD and DVM; and 12,715 BS or equivalent academic degrees. Most of the MD and DVM signers also have underlying degrees in basic science.&quot;
*Petitioners were also requested to list their academic discipline. As of 2007, about 2,400 people in addition to the original 17,100 signatories were &quot;trained in fields other than science or whose field of specialization was not specified on their returned petition.&quot; The petition sponsors state the following numbers of individuals from each discipline:
**Atmospheric, Environmental and Earth sciences: 3,805 (Climatology: 39)
**Computer and Mathematical sciences: 935 
**Physics &amp; Aerospace sciences: 5,812
**Chemistry: 4,822
**Biochemistry, Biology, and Agriculture: 2,965
**Medicine: 3,046
**Engineering and General Science: 10,102

===Credentials and authenticity===
The credentials, verification process, and authenticity of the signatories have been questioned.

Jeff Jacoby promoted the Oregon Institute petition as delegates convened for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1998. Jacoby, a columnist for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, said event organizers &quot;take it for granted&quot; that global warming is real when scientists do not agree &quot;that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful&quot; or &quot;that human activity leads to global warming in the first place.&quot; George Woodwell and John Holdren, two members of the National Academy of Sciences, responded to Jacoby in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, describing the petition as a &quot;farce&quot; in part because &quot;the signatories are listed without titles or affiliations that would permit an assessment of their credentials.&quot; Myanna Lahsen said, &quot;Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few.&quot; The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics &quot;added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved&quot;. Spurious names on the list included fictional characters from the television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as &quot;I. C. Ewe&quot;. When questioned about the pop singer during a telephone interview with Joseph Hubert of the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, Robinson acknowledged that her endorsement and degree in microbiology was inauthentic, remarking &quot;When we&#x27;re getting thousands of signatures there&#x27;s no way of filtering out a fake&quot;. A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the &quot;Hawaii Reporter&quot; revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. &quot;These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided.&quot; According to the Petition Project website, the issue of duplication has been resolved. Kevin Grandia offered similar criticism, saying that, although the Petition Project website provides a breakdown of &quot;areas of expertise&quot;, it fails to assort the 0.5% of signatories who claim to have a background in Climatology and Atmospheric Science by name, making independent verification difficult. &quot;This makes an already questionable list seem completely insignificant&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Scientific American&quot; took a random sample &quot;of 30 of the 1,400 signatories claiming to hold a Ph.D. in a climate-related science.&quot;

Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition — one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages. Crudely extrapolating, the petition supporters include a core of about 200 climate researchers – a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.

Former &quot;New Scientist&quot; correspondent Peter Hadfield said that scientists are not experts on every topic, as depicted by the character Brains in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Rather, they must specialize:In between Aaagard and Zylkowski, the first and last names on the petition, are an assortment of metallurgists, botanists, agronomists, organic chemists and so on. ... The vast majority of scientists who signed the petition have never studied climatology and don&#x27;t do any research into it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a Ph.D. A Ph.D in metallurgy just makes you better at metallurgy. It does not transform you into some kind of expert in paleoclimatology. ... So the petition&#x27;s suggestion that everyone with a degree in metallurgy or geophysics knows a lot about climate change, or is familiar with all the research that&#x27;s been done, is patent crap.

== NAS incident ==
A manuscript accompanying the petition was presented in a near identical style and format to contributions that appear in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, a scientific journal, but upon careful examination was distinct from a publication by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, said the presentation was &quot;designed to be deceptive by giving people the impression that the article … is a reprint and has passed peer review.&quot; Pierrehumbert also said the publication was full of &quot;half-truths&quot;. F. Sherwood Rowland, who was at the time foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the Academy received numerous inquiries from researchers who &quot;are wondering if someone is trying to hoodwink them.&quot;

After the petition appeared, the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1998 news release that &quot;The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; or in any other peer-reviewed journal.&quot; It also said &quot;The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy.&quot; The NAS further noted that its own prior published study had shown that &quot;even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge of the relevant phenomena, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses. Investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises.&quot;

Robinson responded in a 1998 article in &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;I used the Proceedings as a model, but only to put the information in a format that scientists like to read, not to fool people into thinking it is from a journal.&quot; A 2006 article in the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; stated: Today, Seitz admits that &quot;it was stupid&quot; for the Oregon activists to copy the academy&#x27;s format. Still, he doesn&#x27;t understand why the academy felt compelled to disavow the petition, which he continues to cite as proof that it is &quot;not true&quot; there is a scientific consensus on global warming.

<doc id="625667" wikidata="Q6800558" url="?curid=625667" title="McCormick's Creek State Park">
<text>McCormick&#x27;s Creek State Park is the oldest state park in the U.S. state of Indiana, dedicated on July 4, 1916, as part of the state&#x27;s centennial celebration. It is located west of Bloomington in Owen County. The park receives about 640,000 visitors annually.

The park is 1 of 14 Indiana State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with the park seeing 4 minutes and 1 second of totality.

==History==

The park was named after the area&#x27;s first settler, John McCormick, who settled on there in 1816, along the canyon by the waterfalls. Up to that time, the land had been hunted by Miami Indians. McCormick&#x27;s Creek Falls is the main attraction at McCormick&#x27;s Creek State Park.

On May 12, 1916, a local newspaper editor suggested to an Indiana state legislator that the McCormick&#x27;s Creek area would be a suitable location for a state park. German-born Indianapolis businessman Richard Lieber championed the idea of establishing a system of state parks for Indiana, and, after winning the property at auction with a bid of $5,250, received it from the Dr. Frederick Denkewalter estate. McCormick&#x27;s Creek was formally opened on December 11, 1916; the centennial birthday of Indiana. In 1927 a naturalist program was started, a first for Indiana and the United States.

Much of the infrastructure of the park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal era, and many of the CCC-built structures, retaining walls, and elegant, arched limestone bridges remain in use today. The park entrance gatehouse, former nature center, and a stone arch bridge over McCormick&#x27;s Creek were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. There are eight numbered hiking trails in the park, accessing features and park attractions, which include a fire tower, a scenic ravine and waterfall, small cave, sinkhole formations, and towering stands of second-growth Midwestern hardwoods. The park also features a fine system of equestrian paths.

Also on-site is The Canyon Inn, a former sanitarium that now hosts guests for the night. It has an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Overnight camping is also available. In addition, the Old State House quarry is a source of the Indiana limestone used in the Indiana State Capitol building.

==Canyon and waterfall==
The heart of the park is McCormick&#x27;s Creek Canyon. The upper levels of the canyon are around above sea levels, dropping to the west fork of the White River which is near . The McCormick&#x27;s Creek waterfall is a primary attraction of the park, as Indiana has few waterfalls due to the relatively flat topography of the state.

==Hiking trails==

Wolf Cave Nature Preserve

Trail #5. The Wolf Cave Trail is considered to be of MODERATE difficulty. The trail is long, and it loops through the Wolf Cave Nature Preserve. It is relatively level with a drop into a shallow valley. The trail begins at the Wolf Cave Parking Area. The forest along the route is a Beech-Maple forest. Wolf Cave was formed by the collapse of a cave, leaving only the middle section &#x27;the cave&#x27; still roofed.

McCormick&#x27;s Creek Falls Trail

Trail #3. This short is considered RUGGED. The trail begins across from Canyon Inn and drops down before rising at the edge of McCormick&#x27;s Creek Canyon. The trail access and overlook parking lot here before descending to the bottom of the canyon. There are no bridges across the creek. Fluctuating water levels makes some areas seasonably inaccessible. The trail ends at Stoney Restroom, a short walk back to the Canyon Inn.

<doc id="625672" wikidata="Q1029244" url="?curid=625672" title="Camosun College">
<text>Camosun College is a public college located in Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. The college has two campuses, Lansdowne and Interurban, with a total full-time equivalent enrollment of 4,946 students in 2022/23. Camosun College also provides contract training for local business; research, innovation and prototyping services for industry; and trained co-op students for employers.

The Lansdowne campus provides University transfer and access programs, as well as career, technical and vocational programs in the fields of the arts, sciences, business, Indigenous studies, dental hygiene and dental assistant programs. The Interurban campus delivers programs in access, business, trades, technologies, sports and exercise education, and health and human services. The college also hosts a student paper, &quot;The Nexus&quot;.

The enabling legislation is the &quot;College and Institute Act&quot;.

==Student body==

In 2022/23, Camosun had 4,946 full-time equivalent students between its Lansdowne and Interurban campuses. Total student headcount for 2022/23 included 1,045 Indigenous students, and 4,670 international students. The college boasts more than 68,000 alumni.

==History==
 The roots of the college began in 1914 when the Young Building was built as Victoria&#x27;s first Normal School on part of a plot belonging to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, now part of the Lansdowne Campus. The school&#x27;s enrolment at the time was about 275.

During the Second World War, the Young Building was converted into a military hospital. In 1946, the building was returned to its original function as an educational institution shared between the Normal School and Victoria College, which were united in 1956.

In 1967, the Normal School and Victoria College moved to the site of the Gordon Head Campus of the University of Victoria and the Institute of Adult Studies was established by the Greater Victoria School Board. The Institute of Adult Studies was located in what is currently the Ewing Building, and was the first centre in Canada to offer daytime courses for adults wishing to upgrade to high school graduation.

Local interest in a community college grew, and on October 9, 1970, Victoria residents voted in favour of establishing a college. Plans for &quot;Juan de Fuca&quot; College were followed. The provincial government formally approved the college on October 27, 1970.

In 1971 the college councillors voted on a name change, and &quot;Camosun&quot; (pronounced Cam-Ō-sun) was chosen, as it had been an early name for Victoria. It is originally a Lekwungen (Songhees) name for an area of Victoria where different waters meet and are transformed. By September 1971, the final steps toward the realization of a college were taken when Camosun (Lansdowne campus) and the BC Vocational School (Interurban campus) merged to become B.C.&#x27;s ninth community college.

Throughout 2021, the college celebrated its 50th anniversary. A special anniversary logo drawing on the story of Camossung was commissioned from alumn and Indignenous artist Dylan Thomas.

The trade-mark with the words &#x27;Camosun College&#x27; was filed with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office Canadian Trade-marks database on 2008-02-22.

Camosun College enrolled its first students in September 1971 when it opened as a two-year institution offering university transfer, vocational and upgrading courses to the residents of southern Vancouver Island.

In 2022/23, the college had around 1,400 employees and a budget of $147.4 million.

==Campus==
===Lansdowne===
The Lansdowne campus is located in Saanich, on the corner of Lansdowne and Foul Bay Roads, overlooking the city of Victoria and the Olympic Mountains. Each semester, the Lansdowne campus hosts students enrolled in university transfer, college preparatory and access programs as well as career programs in arts, science, business, and dental hygiene and dental assistant programs.

The campus facilities are surrounded by tree-lined grounds. The Alan Batey Library, opened in 1991, is located prominently in the centre of the campus. The Dental Health Education Centre, opened in 1990, stands opposite the Library.

The Isabel Dawson building is the centre for most student services including information and registration, academic advising, financial aid, assessment, disability support services, international student services, counselling and the career resource centre. The Fisher building houses the campus bookstore and cafeteria, as well as classrooms, labs and offices for nursing, biology, physics, chemistry and other disciplines. The Paul Building and Richmond House also provide space for classrooms, labs and offices. The Child Care Centre looks after about 25 children on campus.

In the southeast corner of the campus the Dunlop House is a heritage building which houses the Hotel and Restaurant Management program&#x27;s student-operated restaurant. In contrast to all the facilities on campus, the 1914 Young Building with its clock tower and Italian Renaissance architecture, sits on the south-west corner of the campus and is an historic city landmark.

Camosun College&#x27;s music program and the Victoria Conservatory of Music have shared a building on the Lansdowne campus since 1991.

Most of the college&#x27;s Health and Human Services programs moved from the Lansdowne campus to the Interurban campus in fall 2019 after the new Alex &amp; Jo Campbell Centre for Health and Wellness opened.

In October 2022, the college celebrated the reopening of the newly renovated Wilna Thomas Building featuring new spaces for study, collaboration, events and Indigenous learning.

===Interurban===

The Interurban campus is located in a rural Saanich setting, approximately 15 minutes from downtown Victoria. Students attend classes at Interurban focused on access, business, trades, technology, business or health and human services programs. The campus is surrounded by natural woodland, fields and walking trails.

Located next to Interurban Road, the Campus Centre provides information about Camosun programs and services. The building also houses registration, the career resource centre, academic advising, counselling, employment services, the bookstore, library, fitness centre, Student Society offices and a number of administrative offices, meeting rooms and classrooms. On the courtyard side of the building the clock-tower faces a pole carved especially for Camosun by Richard Hunt, as part of the 1994 Commonwealth Games legacy.

In the middle of campus sits the Helmut Huber Cook Training Centre, which houses the Culinary Arts Foundation program. The campus community and the public can purchase breakfast and lunch prepared by students, and in the evening, part of the cafeteria is transformed into the Classroom Restaurant. In 2018 the Culinary Arts program was expanded to include food truck operation.

On the north end of the campus, the Jack White and John Drysdale buildings house the offices of Continuing Education and Contract Training and most of Camosun&#x27;s trades programs. Several entry-level, apprenticeship, pre-employment and upgrading programs operate year-round, all providing a mix of in-class learning and hands-on shop work.

Overlooking the campus is the Technology Centre and the Centre for Business and Access. Joined in the middle, these buildings feature plant-filled atriums. The building also includes a daycare centre for infants, toddlers and preschoolers.

Behind the campus is the Vancouver Island Technology Park, providing access for Camosun faculty and students entering into partnerships with local industry and research projects. Located on the south side of the campus, the Pacific Institute for Sport Excellence (PISE), a centre for academics and athletics, was completed in September 2008. The centre is a partnership between Camosun College and Pacific Sport Victoria and brings together local and national-level sport education, leadership, research and athletic development under one roof.

With provincial funding received in September 2012, Camosun&#x27;s Centre for Trades Education and Innovation (CTEI) was designed by B+H Architects and built by CitySpaces Consulting, and was expected to be completed in early 2015. The new centre includes a Marine and Metal Trades Centre for the welding, sheet metal, metal fabrication, nautical and ship building and repair programs, as well as a Mechanical Trades Centre for the heavy duty/commercial truck transport and automotive service technician programs. There is also an electrical shop.

A new healthcare training facility officially opened its doors at Camosun College&#x27;s Interurban Campus in September 2019. The Alex and Jo Campbell Centre for Health and Wellness offers 15 different health and human service programs, including medical radiography technology, early childhood education, mental health and addictions courses and a range of nursing programs.

==Research==
Camosun Innovates is the applied research-arm of Camosun College. Camosun Innovates was the first federally-funded Technology Access Centre in British Columbia.

The Camosun Technology Access Centre is an applied research and innovation centre. The Centre offers a range of services in advanced manufacturing, technology adoption and human performance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the college was instrumental in the design and manufacture of more than 9,000 medical-grade face shields. as well as a fully portable decontamination device for Island Health.

==Organization==
The President of the college is Dr. Lane Trotter. Lane started as President on Jan. 1, 2022, taking over from Sherri Bell.

==Sports and students&#x27; union activities==

===Sports===
Camosun College has five sports teams (all called the Chargers): men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s volleyball, and men&#x27;s golf. There is also a curling team.

<text>The London Coliseum (also known as the Coliseum Theatre) is a theatre in St Martin&#x27;s Lane, Westminster, built as one of London&#x27;s largest and most luxurious &quot;family&quot; variety theatres. Opened on 24 December 1904 as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties, it was designed by the architect Frank Matcham for the impresario Oswald Stoll. Their ambition was to build the largest and finest music hall, described as the &quot;people&#x27;s palace of entertainment&quot; of its age.

At the time of construction, the Coliseum was one of the few theatres in Europe to provide lifts for taking patrons to the upper levels of the house, and was the first theatre in England to have a triple revolve installed on its stage. The theatre has 2,359 seats making it the largest theatre in London.

After being used for variety shows, musical comedies, and stage plays for many years, then as a cinema screening films in the Cinerama format between 1963 and 1968, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company moved into the building in 1968. The Sadler&#x27;s Wells company changed its name to the English National Opera in 1974 and today it is used primarily for opera as well as being the London home of the English National Ballet.

== History ==
The London Coliseum was built by the architect Frank Matcham who intended it to be one of London&#x27;s largest and most luxurious &quot;family&quot; variety theatres. Construction began in 1903 and the venue opened on 24 December the following year as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties. It is located in St Martin&#x27;s Lane, London.

Matcham built the theatre for the theatrical impresario Sir Oswald Stoll and had the ambition of it being the largest and finest &quot;People’s palace of entertainment&quot; of the age.

Matcham wanted a Theatre of Variety – not a music hall but equally not highbrow entertainment. The resulting programme was a mix of music hall and variety theatre, with one act – a full scale revolving chariot race – requiring the stage to revolve. The theatre&#x27;s original slogan was PRO BONO PUBLICO (For the public good). It was opened in 1904 and the inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December that year.

English Heritage, in its description of the theatre when it was given listed status in 1960 notes that it is &quot;exuberant Free Baroque ambitious design, the Edwardian &quot;Theatre de Luxe of London&quot; with richly decorated interiors and a vast and grandiose auditorium.&quot; The description continues: &quot;Lavish foyer and circulation areas with marble facings, culminating in vast 3-tier auditorium with wealth of eclectic classical detail of Byzantine opulence, some motifs such as the squat columns dividing the lowest tier of slip boxes, backing the stalls, almost Sullivanesque; pairs of 2-tiered bow fronted boxes with domed canopies at gallery level and semi-domed, Ionic-columned pairs of 2 tiered orchestra boxes, contained in arched and pedimented frames surmounted by sculptural groups with lion-drawn chariots. Great, semi-circular, blocked architrave proscenium arch with cartouche- trophy keystone.&quot;

The inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December 1904, but it &quot;was a total failure and closed down completely only two years after opening in 1906 and remained closed until December of 1907 when it was reopened and at last became successful.&quot; In 1908, the London Coliseum was host to a cricket match between Middlesex and Surrey. In 1911, dramatist W. S. Gilbert produced his last play here, &quot;The Hooligan&quot;.

The theatre changed its name from the London Coliseum to the Coliseum Theatre between 1931 and 1968 when a run of 651 performances of the operetta &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; began on 8 April 1931. Additionally, Arthur Lewis notes that:
:Pantomimes began in 1936 with &quot;Cinderella&quot; and continued regularly until 1946. In 1947 the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; was staged at the Coliseum and had a staggeringly successful run for the time, of 1,304 performances and three continuous years which was the longest run in theatrical history. There then followed a long run of major American hits beginning with &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; in 1951, &quot;Guys And Dolls&quot; in 1953, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; in 1955, and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; in 1957. But this exceptional period did at last come to an end in 1957 when the production of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; failed to enthrall anyone.

The Coliseum reverted to the original name when the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company moved there in 1968 and, in 1974, the Company changed its name to become the English National Opera; it bought the freehold of the building for £12.8 million in 1992. The Coliseum hosted both the 2004 and 2006 Royal Variety Performances and is also the London base for performances by English National Ballet, which perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour.

The Who performed there and recorded their concert, on 14 December 1969.

== Technical aspects ==
While its wing space is limited due to the constricted site on which the theatre was built, as Lloyd notes, &quot;the stage of the London Coliseum was also on a vast scale; 55 feet wide by 92 feet deep&quot;.
The stage is not raked. It has the widest proscenium arch in London and was one of the first to have electric lighting. It was built with a triple revolving stage, although this was rarely used. The Coliseum was originally designed to seat 2,939 people on four levels. Despite the seating capacity being reduced since the Theatre&#x27;s opening, it still has the largest seating capacity of any Theatre in the West End at 2,359.

The theatre retains many of its original features and was given a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage in September 1960. Prior to Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company taking over the Coliseum in 1968, the house was &quot;fully restored, redecorated, and a large orchestra pit installed&quot;. It reopened on 21 August 1968, with a production of the opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

Another extensive renovation took place between 2000 and 2004. when the design team included the architects RHWL and Arup as acousticians and building engineers.

The London Coliseum has two lifts which provide step-free access for disabled patrons to all levels, except the Upper Circle.

==Use as a cinema==
Periodically, the Coliseum was used to show films and, when the &quot;&#x27;talkies&#x27; arrived at the Coliseum in 1933, films were run at the theatre for a year. The greatest sensation at this time was the showing of &quot;King Kong&quot; which ran at the Coliseum for months with 10,000 people seeing the film there every day.&quot;

After a lacklustre period of poorly received musicals came to an end, in June 1961 the theatre was leased by MGM for use as a cinema during the period that the Empire, Leicester Square was closed for rebuilding. The initial presentation, from 6 June, was a revival of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; which ran for 3 months. On 2 November the World Premiere of &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; took place in the presence of the film&#x27;s star, Bob Hope, and following this, on 15 November, was the UK premiere of Samuel Bronston&#x27;s epic &quot;King of Kings&quot;. MGM continued to use the theatre even after the new Empire, Leicester Square reopened in December 1962, but MGM&#x27;s lease expired on 19 May 1963 and the theatre was then leased by the Cinerama Corporation to become the second of London&#x27;s Cinerama locations (after the Casino Cinerama).

Conversion to three-strip projection which used three projectors was undertaken, and an 80 ft wide, 30 ft tall deeply curved screen was installed. Beginning on 16 July 1963, the theatre was renamed the Coliseum Cinerama, with the UK premiere of &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;. This film transferred to the third of London&#x27;s Cinerama houses, the Royalty Theatre on 27 November and the Coliseum was converted for single-projector Cinerama using 70mm film for the Gala UK Premiere of &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World&quot; on 2 December 1963. Other 70mm films followed, &quot;The Magnificent Showman&quot; (the UK Title of &quot;Circus World&quot;), &quot;The Great Race&quot; (a 35mm &quot;blow up&quot;) and &quot;The Bible&quot;. With fewer films made in the format, it later became difficult to programme the theatre. It resorted to revivals of old 70mm movies before opening &quot;The Comedians&quot; on 18 January 1968 (a 70mm Panavision blow up). This ran for nine weeks and was followed by a revival of the 1956 Todd-AO epic &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, the first time this film had been shown in 70mm in London. This ran until 22 May 1968 when Cinerama pulled out and the theatre reverted to live use.

<text>Punt and Dennis are a comedy double act consisting of Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. The duo first met at the Footlights while studying at Cambridge University in the early 1980s. Initially they were an amateur double act performing at various venues in London on the weekends due to Dennis&#x27; weekday job commitments. They have branched into acting and screenwriting.

==Works==

===Radio and television===
Punt and Dennis first appeared on television in Jasper Carrott&#x27;s shows during the late 1980s. They were two of the four main performers in &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, a comedy show on BBC Radio 1 which then transferred to television. While the other two stars of the series, Rob Newman and David Baddiel, became major celebrities — playing to sell-out audiences at Wembley Arena—Punt and Dennis never attained the same level of prominence as a double act. Their own TV series, &quot;The Imaginatively Titled Punt &amp; Dennis Show&quot;, did not meet the same success as &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, but won larger audiences and was given a higher profile than the other pairing&#x27;s spin-off project &quot;Newman and Baddiel in Pieces&quot;.

The duo continued to collaborate despite each having forged their own separate careers — Dennis as a panellist and presenter and Punt as a screenwriter. Their more prominent works include long-running radio shows &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Bad Week&quot; (BBC Radio 2) and BBC Radio 4 shows &quot;The Party Line&quot; and &quot;The Now Show&quot; from 1998 to 2024. They also contribute to the satirical hit panel game &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. Punt is a programme associate while Dennis is a regular panellist alongside Frankie Boyle and later Chris Addison.

===Other===
In 1992 they went on the road themselves and toured the UK with a show called &#x27;Punt And Dennis - The Milky Milky Tour&#x27;. The name of the show was inspired by a character called Mr Strange that Hugh Dennis played in &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;. The Milky Milky tour was filmed live on stage at Bristol&#x27;s Hippodrome Theatre in 1992 and released on VHS Video.

In 2007 they performed a UK tour of their comedy called &quot;Stuff and Nonsense&quot;. In 2010 they announced November 2010 preview shows and a new tour for 2011 (that was titled &#x27;They Should Get Out More&#x27;) which ran from January to March. In 2014 they embarked on a new UK comedy tour called &#x27;Ploughing on Regardless&#x27;. In 2024 they toured a new show called Punt and Dennis: We Are Not A Robot.

<doc id="625677" wikidata="Q696874" url="?curid=625677" title="Triple Intervention">
<text>The Triple Intervention or was a diplomatic intervention by Russia, Germany, and France on 23 April 1895 over the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, imposed by Japan on Qing China at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War. The treaty, signed on 17 April, had ceded the island of Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. In response, the three Western powers advised Japan to renounce the Liaodong Peninsula on the grounds that it would cause instability; Japan, anxious to keep their goodwill, did so by treaty on 8 November. The Japanese public was outraged, especially after Russia obtained a 25-year lease on the peninsula in 1898. The reaction against the Triple Intervention was one of the causes of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, in which Japan won the Russian lease on the peninsula.

==Treaty of Shimonoseki==
Per the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan was awarded the Liaodong Peninsula including the harbor city of Port Arthur, which it had conquered from China. Immediately after the terms of the treaty became public, Russia—with its own designs and sphere of influence in China—expressed concern about the Japanese acquisition of the Liaodong Peninsula and the possible impact of the terms of the treaty on the stability of China. Russia persuaded France and Germany to apply diplomatic pressure on Japan for the return of the territory to China in exchange for a larger indemnity.

==The European powers==
Russia had the most to gain from the Triple Intervention. In the preceding years, Russia had been slowly increasing its influence in the Far East. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the acquisition of a warm-water port would enable Russia to consolidate its presence in the region and further expand into Asia and the Pacific. Russia had not expected that Japan would be victorious against China. Port Arthur falling into Japanese hands would undermine its own desperate need for a warm-water port in the East.

France was obligated to join Russia due to their military alliance. French bankers did have financial interests in Russia, especially in railroads. However, France had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, as its sphere of influence was in southern China &quot;(see Sino-French War)&quot;. The French actually had cordial relations with the Japanese: French military advisors were sent to train the Imperial Japanese Army and a number of Japanese ships were built in French shipyards. However, France did not wish to be diplomatically isolated, as it had been previously, especially given the growing power of Germany.

Germany had two reasons to support Russia. Firstly, it desired to draw Russia&#x27;s attention to the east, away from itself. Secondly, to enlist Russia&#x27;s support in establishing German territorial concessions in China. Germany hoped that supporting Russia would encourage Russia, in turn, to support Germany&#x27;s colonial ambitions, which were especially vexed since Germany had only recently formed itself into a unified nation and had arrived late in the colonial &quot;game&quot;.

==Conclusion==
The Japanese government reluctantly acceded to the intervention, as British and American diplomatic intercession was not forthcoming, and Japan was in no position to militarily resist three major European powers simultaneously. The three powers had 38 warships with a displacement of 95,000 tons already deployed in East Asia, whereas the Imperial Japanese Navy had only 31 warships in total with a displacement of 57,000 tons.

After futile diplomatic efforts to enlist the support of the United States and Great Britain, on 5 May 1895, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi announced the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for an additional indemnity of 30 million kuping taels (450 million yen). The last Japanese troops departed in December.

Much to Japan&#x27;s astonishment and consternation, Russia moved almost immediately to occupy the entire Liaodong Peninsula and especially to fortify Port Arthur. Germany secured control over concessions in Shandong Province. France and even Great Britain took advantage of a weakened China to seize the port cities of Guangzhouwan and Weihaiwei, respectively, on various pretexts and to expand their spheres of influence.

Japan&#x27;s government felt it had been cheated of its deserved spoils of war by this intervention. This humiliation at the hands of the European powers helped lead to the movement. Figuratively translated as &quot;Persevering through Hardship (for the sake of revenge)&quot;, the saying is derived from the Chinese &quot;chengyu&quot; of &quot;wòxīnchángdǎn&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;sleeping on sticks and tasting gall&quot;, that alludes to the perseverance of King Goujian of Yue (reigned 496–465 BC) in the war between Wu and Yue. For modern Japan, this ideology meant an increase in heavy industry and the strength of the armed forces, especially the navy, at the expense of individual wants and needs.

The Triple Intervention had a profound effect on Japanese foreign relations, as Japanese diplomacy sought to avoid a reconstitution of a combination of European powers against Japan. It led directly to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 which was explicitly intended to shield Japan from interference from other European great powers, and from Russia in particular.

<doc id="625680" wikidata="Q7165877" url="?curid=625680" title="People for the American Way">
<text>People for the American Way (PFAW ) is a progressive advocacy group in the United States. Organized as a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization, PFAW was registered in 1981 by the television producer Norman Lear, a self-described liberal who founded the organization in 1980 to challenge the Christian right agenda of the Moral Majority.

==History==
PFAW was founded by the television producer Norman Lear in opposition to the publicized agenda of the Moral Majority, a prominent and influential American political organization associated with the Christian right. Officially incorporated on September 4, 1980, its co-founders included Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, University of Notre Dame President Theodore Hesburgh and Time Inc. chairman and CEO Andrew Heiskell. PFAW began as a project of the Tides Foundation, a donor-advised fund that directs money to politically liberal causes.

Former presidents of PFAW include Arthur Kropp, Tony Podesta, and Ralph Neas.

Soon after its founding, PFAW launched an affiliated 501(c)(3) organization, People for the American Way Foundation, for the purpose of conducting more extensive educational and research activities for liberal causes. From 2004–2008, major donors to PFAW&#x27;s foundation included George Soros&#x27; Open Society Institute, the Miriam G. and Ira D. Wallach Foundation, the Bauman Family Foundation, and the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund.

In 1998, the People for the American Way Voters Alliance was launched as a political action committee.

==Activities==
PFAW was responsible for the 1982 television special &quot;I Love Liberty&quot;, which was described by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as &quot;America&#x27;s first left-wing patriotic rally.&quot; PFAW has also been active in battles over judicial nominations, opposing U.S. Supreme Court nominees Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh and supporting the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor. PFAW is also active in federal elections, donating $339,874 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2014 election cycle and $351,075 to oppose Republican candidates in the 2016 election cycle.

=== &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot; ===
PFAW&#x27;s &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot; project is a website that catalogs statements of public figures whom they label as right-wing, including politicians, preachers, and others, with a focus on hate speech and right-wing conspiracy theories. The web site was founded in 2007, expanding on PFAW&#x27;s earlier practice of VHS recording clips from television programs such as Pat Robertson&#x27;s &quot;700 Club&quot;, for distribution to news media. In 2013, evangelist and politician Gordon Klingenschmitt sent DMCA takedown notices to YouTube against &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot;&#x27;s channel based on copyright claims. The Electronic Frontier Foundation provided legal counsel to &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot; to defend their channel and posts against YouTube&#x27;s actions.

In 2014, HGTV withdrew from plans to produce a television series with Jason and David Benham after &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot; made an issue of their statements about homosexuality.

In 2018, Salon.com and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; credited Jared Holt, a &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot; researcher, for causing the removal of Alex Jones&#x27;s &quot;InfoWars&quot; program from multiple content distribution sites, including Apple, Inc, YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify. Afterwards, Holt said he received death threats.

In June 2021, &quot;Right Wing Watch&quot;&#x27;s YouTube channel, which had been operating for about 10 years, was temporarily suspended by YouTube, who stated that the suspension had been an accident. At the time, the channel had about 47,000 subscribers.

==Leadership==
Michael Keegan served as the organization&#x27;s president for 11 years through June 2020. On June 15, 2020, Ben Jealous succeeded Keegan as president, and Svante Myrick succeeded Jealous as president on November 14, 2022. Myrick abruptly resigned as mayor of Ithaca, New York, to take that position. Members of the group&#x27;s board of directors include Cristela Alonzo, Alec Baldwin, Seth MacFarlane, Joel Madden, Bertis Downs IV, Dolores Huerta, Josh Sapan, Howie Klein, Alyssa Milano, David Saperstein, Margery Tabankin, Reg Weaver, and Carrie Mae Weems.

<doc id="625692" wikidata="Q5491631" url="?curid=625692" title="HMS Finisterre (D55)">
<text>HMS &quot;Finisterre&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after one of the battles of Cape Finisterre. She was the first and thus far the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear this name.

&quot;Finisterre&quot; was built by Fairfields of Govan on the Clyde. She was laid down on 8 December 1942, launched on 22 June 1944 and completed on 11 September 1945.

==Operational service==

&quot;Finnisterre&quot; first joined the Home Fleet upon her commissioning. After being in the Far East for some time, in which she performed a variety of duties there, &quot;Finisterre&quot; returned to the UK via the Mediterranean. In January 1950, &quot;Finisterre&quot; took part in the rescue attempt of the submarine , which had sunk after colliding with the Swedish merchant ship &quot;Divina&quot; in the Thames Estuary. The collision had resulted in the loss of 64 of those on board. The following year &quot;Finisterre&quot; became the Gunnery Training Ship, based at Whale Island, Portsmouth as part of .

In 1953, &quot;Finisterre&quot; took part in the 1953 Coronation Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;Finisterre&quot; was positioned adjacent to her sister ship .

The following year &quot;Finisterre&quot; was placed in Reserve. After her sister ship, , collided with an Indian cruiser in August 1959, &quot;Finisterre&quot; replaced her in the 1st Destroyer Squadron, based in the Far East. She took over duties of her sister ship, , to complete a tour of Australia over the Christmas period of 1959. &quot;Finisterre&quot;, as part of that squadron, subsequently saw service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. She was one of a number of Royal Navy ships stationed off Kuwait to keep the peace as the country gained its independence in 1961.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
She arrived for scrapping at the yard of W.H.Arnott Young Co. Ltd, Dalmuir on 12 June 1967.

<text>The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, located on Observatory Hill, in Saanich, British Columbia, was completed in 1918 by the Canadian government. The Dominion architect responsible for the building was Edgar Lewis Horwood. The main instrument is the Plaskett telescope, proposed and designed by John S. Plaskett in 1910 with the support of the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research.

The observatory has been designated a national historic site of Canada, as it is a world-renowned facility where many discoveries about the nature of the Milky Way were made, and it was one of the world&#x27;s main astrophysical research centres until the 1960s.

==Public programs==
The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Victoria Centre, which has a long association with the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and public outreach dating back to 1914, holds free public &quot;star parties&quot; at the DAO on select summer Saturday evenings. These events include solar and nighttime viewing with RASC and DAO telescopes, presentations, lectures, and displays.

===Centre of the Universe===

The Centre of the Universe was the public interpretive centre for the observatory that was regularly open to the public between May and September. The centre featured interactive exhibits about astronomy, the work of the observatory and its parent organization, the NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics. There were also tours of the telescope and programs in the planetarium and video theatre. The centre was closed by the federal government in August 2013, which stated financial issues as the reason. The Friends of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory Society (FDAO) was formed in 2015 with a goal of reinstating the programs terminated when the Centre of the Universe was closed. In May 2016, the FDAO signed a licence to occupy for the Centre of the Universe with the National Research Council.

==Telescope construction==

The building that houses the telescope was built by McAlpine-Robertson Company of Vancouver for a price of $75,000. Both the building and dome, made by Warner &amp; Swasey Company, are double walled.

The glass mirror, in diameter and thick, weighs approximately and was made by the Saint-Gobain company in their Charleroi glass works in Antwerp, Belgium, and shipped only a week before the start of World War I. It was then ground in the United States at the John A. Brashear Co. (founded by astronomer and telescope pioneer John A. Brashear) in Pittsburgh. The mirror had to be reground twice, once due to a mysterious scratch and the second time due to a flaw in the grinding. This added two years to the completion time of the telescope, pushing the date back to 1918. The mirror was sent to Victoria by train, which arrived in Victoria six days later. The completed mirror was hauled up Little Saanich Mountain by horse and wagon.

Images of the construction are available.

==Use==

Following completion, Plaskett remained the head of the observatory until 1935.

A spectrograph is fitted to the Cassegrain focus and an imaging charge-coupled device (CCD) is attached to the Newtonian focus.

In 1962, a optical telescope was added to the observatory. The telescope, ordered in 1957, was made by Grubb Parsons of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Its Coude focus is used with a room-sized spectrograph.

In 1995, the observatory was made the headquarters of the NRC Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, which operates several Canadian telescopes, both optical and radio. The NRC collaborates with international partners such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.

The telescopes are in constant use and are open for visitors year round. An interpretive centre called the Centre of the Universe was opened in 2002 but closed in 2013 due to budgetary reasons. The Centre of the Universe was reopened in 2014 through an arrangement with the a working group consisting of members of the public who came together in response to the closure, along with the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&#x27;s Victoria Centre, and Science Venture at the University of Victoria. Work on the non-profit charity Friends of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory began in 2014 because of the desire of the National Research Council to deal with a single organization with respect to the Centre of the Universe, and it was formally constituted and registered in 2015. The Friends of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory now runs the education programmes on-site and online.

, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory Director was Dr James De Francesco.

==World-record status==

The Plaskett telescope was possibly planned to be the largest telescope in the world but delays meant it was completed and saw &quot;first light&quot; on May 6, 1918, six months after the 100-inch Hooker telescope () at Mount Wilson Observatory. However, although the Hooker telescope achieved a first light on November 1, 1917, it was not really opened until 1918, which was also affected by delays especially from World War I. At this point most observatories still had 19th-century-era refractors of at most in aperture, as a shift to reflectors was still growing.

It also surpassed the metal mirror Leviathan of Parsonstown, built in 1845 but dismantled by the 1910s.

The Plaskett telescope remained the second largest until the reflector at David Dunlap Observatory in 1935 (also in Canada) debuted.

Top 2 in 1918:

The next largest were the Harvard College Observatory and the Mount Wilson 60-inch Hale.

<text>Ernestine Schumann-Heink (15 June 186117 November 1936) was a Bohemian-born Austrian-American operatic dramatic contralto of German Bohemian descent. She was noted for the flexibility and wide range of her voice. Heink and Schumann were her two husbands&#x27; surnames.

==Early life==
She was born Ernestine Amalie Pauline Rössler on 15 June 1861 to a German-speaking family at Libeň (), Bohemia, Austrian Empire, which is now part of the city of Prague, Czech Republic. She was baptized in her father&#x27;s Roman Catholic faith five days later. Her father, who called his daughter &quot;Tini&quot;, was Johann &quot;Hans&quot; Rössler. Before working as a shoe maker, he served as an Austrian cavalry officer. He had been stationed in northern Italy (then an Austrian protectorate), where he met and married Charlotte Josepha Goldman, who was Jewish and with whom he returned to Libeň. Her maternal grandmother, Leah Kohn, was of Hungarian Jewish descent and first prophesied Ernestine&#x27;s successful career.

When Ernestine was three years old, the family moved to Verona. In 1866, at the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, the family moved to Prague, where she was schooled at the Ursuline Convent. At war&#x27;s end, the Roesslers moved to Podgórze, now part of Kraków, where she attended convent school. The family moved again to Graz when Ernestine was thirteen. Here she met Marietta von LeClair, a retired opera singer, who agreed to give her voice lessons.

In 1876, Ernestine gave her first professional performance (at age 15) as alto soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony in Graz. Her operatic debut was on 15 October 1878 at the Dresden Royal Opera House, where for four seasons she played the role of Azucena in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, and served as principal contralto when she was 17.

==First marriage==
In 1882 she married Johann Georg Ernst Albert Heink (1854–1933), secretary of the Semperoper, the Saxon State Opera Dresden; this violated the terms of their contracts, and both had their employment abruptly terminated. Heink took a job at the local customs house and was soon transferred to Hamburg. Ernestine remained in Dresden to pursue her career, and eventually rejoined her husband when she secured a position at the Hamburg Opera. She went on to have four children with Heink: August, Charlotte, Henry and Hans.

Ernest Heink was again thrown out of work when Saxons were banned from government positions, and departed to Saxony to find work. Ernestine, pregnant, did not follow him; they were divorced in 1892 when Ernestine was thirty-one years old. She came to the United States to make a brief foray into Broadway theatre, playing in Julian Edwards&#x27; operetta &quot;Love&#x27;s Lottery&quot;, in which her performance was noted for the fact that she often broke off to ask the audience whether her English was good enough. She left the production after 50 performances and soon returned to opera.

Her breakthrough to leading roles came after an argument between prima donna and the director of the Hamburg opera, when he asked Ernestine to sing the title role of &quot;Carmen&quot;instead, and without rehearsal, which she did to great acclaim. Goetze angrily quit the role of Fidès in &quot;Le prophète&quot;, to be performed the following night, and was again replaced by Schumann-Heink who for a third time replaced Goetze as Ortrud in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; the following evening, one more time without rehearsal, and was offered a ten-year contract.

In 1887, Schumann-Heink sang Johannes Brahms&#x27; &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot; under the direction of Hans von Bülow in a concert in Hamburg, with Brahms in attendance. She was then engaged by Bülow to sing in a cycle of Mozart performances later that year. However, she had to withdraw from these performances due to the birth of her fourth child, Hans, in November 1887. This withdrawal angered Bülow, and their relationship did not continue.

==Second marriage==
After the divorce from her first husband, she married Paul Schumann, an actor and director of the Thalia Theater in Hamburg in 1892. She acquired a stepson, Walter, and had three more children with Paul: Ferdinand Schumann, Marie Theresa Schumann, and George Washington Schumann. This last boy was born in New York City, named by his good-humored mother with suggestion of the doctor who delivered the baby. One of their children, Ferdinand (1893–1958) was a prolific, though mostly unbilled, Hollywood character actor.

Paul Schumann died in Germany on 28 November 1904. While fighting a legal battle in Germany over her husband&#x27;s estate, she filed her United States naturalization papers on 10 February 1905, and became a U.S. citizen on 3 March 1908.

==International career==
Schumann-Heink performed with Gustav Mahler at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, during the Hamburg company&#x27;s London season in 1892, and became well known for her performances of the works of Richard Wagner, forging &quot;a long and fruitful relationship with [the Annual] Bayreuth [Wagnerian music Festival]&quot; that &quot;lasted from 1896 to 1914&quot;.

Schumann-Heink&#x27;s first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City was in 1899, and she performed regularly there until 1932. She recorded the first of her many musical gramophone performances in 1900. Several of these early sound recordings originally released on 78 RPM discs have been reissued on CD format. Although there are some imperfections in her singing, her technical brilliance still leaves a deep impression on listeners.

==Third marriage==
On 11 February 1905, Schumann-Heink became an American citizen. On 27 May 1905, aged 43, she married her manager William Rapp Jr., son of Wilhelm Rapp, in Chicago, Illinois. They lived lived on Grandview Avenue, North Caldwell, New Jersey in her Villa Fides from April 1906 to December 1911. They then moved to of farm land located just outside San Diego, California, purchased by her in January 1910, where she would live for most of the rest of her life.

In 1909, she created the role of Klytaemnestra in the debut of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra,&quot; of which she said she had no high opinion, calling it &quot;a fearful din&quot;. Strauss was not entirely captivated by Schumann-Heink either; according to one story, during rehearsals he admonished the orchestra, &quot;Louder! I can still hear Madame Schumann-Heink!&quot;

She separated from her husband on 10 December 1911. She filed for divorce in 1913. They divorced in 1914 and the appeals court upheld the lower court decision in 1915. In 1915, she appeared as herself in the early documentary film &quot;Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World&#x27;s Fair at San Francisco&quot; directed by Fatty Arbuckle, who appears as himself in the film.

==Charitable work and community support==

While living at North Caldwell, Schumann-Heink became interested in efforts to honor President Grover Cleveland. The future president was born in 1837 in nearby Caldwell, New Jersey, where his father, Rev. Richard Cleveland was minister of the First Presbyterian Church. On 10 September 1912, Schumann-Heink performed a benefit concert at the church to raise money to purchase the adjacent Presbyterian manse, Cleveland&#x27;s birthplace. In 1913, the Grover Cleveland Birthplace Memorial Association (GCBMA) purchased the manse and opened it to the public as a museum.

During World War I, she supported the United States and its armed forces. She entertained the troops and raised money for Liberty Bonds, as well as &quot;the Red Cross, knights of Columbus, Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, and Jewish War Relief, and to entertaining soldiers Throughout the United States&quot; in order to help wounded veterans. She toured the United States raising money for the war effort, although she had relatives fighting on both sides of the war – including her sons August Heink, a merchant sailor who had been impressed into the German submarine service, Walter Schumann, Henry Heink and George Washington Schumann, all in the United States Navy.

==Later years==
In 1926, she first sang &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; (&quot;Silent Night&quot;) (in both German and English) over the radio for Christmas. This became a Christmas tradition with US radio listeners through Christmas of 1935. In 1927, she performed in an early Vitaphone sound short film, possibly the only surviving footage of her singing other than a brief performance she gave during the filming of a voice lesson she was giving to a group of aspiring young American mezzo-sopranos. She lost most of her assets in the Wall Street crash of 1929 and was forced to sing again at age 69.

In 1926, then 65, she had begun a weekly radio program, in addition to announcing her plans to &quot;teach forty American girls&quot;; Schumann &quot;spent considerable time advising women to forgo politics, smoking and unchaperoned dancing, and to devote themselves to bringing up children&quot;. In 1929, she taught tenor Arnold Blackner. Her last performance at the Metropolitan Opera was in 1932, performing Erda in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, aged 71.

In January 1927, the American Tobacco Company (ATC) launched a print advertisement campaign for their Lucky Strikes brand featuring Schumann-Heink&#x27;s photo and endorsement, the first campaign of its kind in the United States that featured a woman. The advertisement included the statement signed by Schumann-Heink &quot;I recommend Lucky Strikes because they are kind to my throat.&quot; The copy also included ATC&#x27;s statement &quot;When smoking, she prefers Lucky Strikes because they give the greatest enjoyment and throat protection.&quot; Later that year, Schumann-Heink refuted the endorsement as fraudulent, and by the end of 1927 ATC reran the same campaign but with Nina Morgana&#x27;s endorsement instead.

==Death and legacy ==
Schumann-Heink died of leukemia on 17 November 1936 in Hollywood, California, aged 75. Her funeral was conducted by the American Legion at the Hollywood Post Auditorium, and she was interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego. Her archive was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.

On Memorial Day, 30 May 1938, a bronze tablet honouring Schumann-Heink was unveiled by her granddaughter, Barbara Heink, at the Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park, San Diego. The tablet featured a star that reads:

<doc id="625699" wikidata="Q6035421" url="?curid=625699" title="Inner Healing Movement">
<text>The Inner Healing Movement refers to a grassroots lay counseling movement among Christians of various denominations.

==History==

Agnes Sanford (1897–1982) is considered to be the mother of the inner healing movement. Along with her husband, she founded The Agnes Sanford School of Pastoral Care in 1958.

The inner healing movement is also often compared and associated with &quot;Inner Healing&quot; and &quot;Healing of Memories&quot;. Other people who feature prominently in its history are Ruth Carter Stapleton, Leanne Payne, Francis MacNutt and Charles Fillmore. A number of organizations are currently active, including Elijah House, Ministries of Pastoral Care, and Sozo Ministries.

== Concerns about memory work ==
Theophostic Prayer Ministry (TPM) techniques and other inner healing models that incorporate memory work have become popular. However, some have concerns about these approaches with some of their underlying principles being compared with those of recovered-memory therapy (RMT). In the &quot;Journal of Psychology and Theology&quot;, Spring 2004, Christian psychologist David Entwistle summarized some concerns associated with Theophostic methods: &#x27;TPM follows in the lineage of &quot;healing of memory&quot; techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of [dissociative identity disorder, Satanic ritual abuse], and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of iatrogenic memory contamination.&#x27;

TPM and others, such as De Silva and Liebscher of Sozo ministry, denounce the use of memory recovery as described in the above concerns.

<text>10,000 Trees for the Rouge Valley is a 100% volunteer-run environmental tree-planting organization that has held many Toronto-area tree plantings. It is a volunteer group that is dedicated to helping the environment, as it has restored more than of fragile land in the Rouge Watershed with the assistance of individuals, families, governments and community groups, since 1990. The species of trees are carefully chosen to attract and support wildlife, stabilize the soil, and improve the air and water quality. In addition, the organisation tries to protect creeks and streams from soil erosion, and it has been able to link areas of forest and extend wildlife corridors.

The tree plantings are intended to restore the Rouge River&#x27;s watershed to natural cover, protect creeks and streams from soil erosion, help to link existing islands of forest and extend wildlife corridors. It was formed in 1989 as an offshoot of the Save the Rouge Valley group and the Rouge Valley Foundation, which it is still attached to. Some of the volunteers are high school students who are required to accumulate a certain number of volunteering hours before they can graduate.

==A World of Opportunity for Forest and Landscape Restoration==
The IUCN secretariat has published a map depicting forest and landscape restoration opportunities and recent deforestation. A map of suburban sprawl areas built after 1945 is also available.

<text>The Contender is an American reality television series that initially aired from March 3, 2005, to January 7, 2009, on NBC, ESPN, and Versus and currently airs on Epix. Each season of the series follows a group of boxers as they compete with one another in an elimination-style competition, while their lives and relationships with each other and their families are depicted.

The series was created and executive produced by Mark Burnett. The first three seasons of the show were hosted by Sugar Ray Leonard, who shared hosting duties in the first season with actor Sylvester Stallone. Leonard departed the series after season three and Tony Danza joined as his replacement.

On January 22, 2018, it was announced that the series was being revived by premium cable network Epix for a fifth season which premiered on August 24, 2018.

==Premise==
The show takes the format of a gameshow, with the boxers divided into two teams based on their place of residence in the United States: East Coast or West Coast (or simply “East” and “West”). These teams live together in group living quarters, in Pasadena, California in the historic Royal Laundry Building on Raymond Avenue and compete for the right to choose which of their team members fights that week, and who he fights against. Most of the second half of the hour-long episodes are devoted to that fight: the loser is eliminated.

==Production==
The series’ tagline is “The Next Great Human Drama”, and its soundtrack was scored by Hans Zimmer. Before the show premiered, rival American television Fox network rushed to air a competing show &quot;The Next Great Champ&quot;, hosted by Oscar De La Hoya. The show performed very poorly, with the final episodes being relegated to cable FSN. In an effort to distance itself from the Fox disaster, NBC opted to hold airing its show until spring 2005.

On May 16, 2005, the series was cancelled. The first season cost NBC $2,000,000 per episode. Reruns were seen on CNBC. On August 11, 2005, ESPN announced that it was picking up the rights to a second season of the show, which began airing on the network in July 2006, although special editions under the &quot;Contender&quot; title are currently airing as of March, 2006. ESPN also announced that it has options to renew the series for two additional seasons. However, on April 10, 2008, ESPN announced that it was canceling the series. Executive producer Jeff Wald maintained that the show would continue on another network. It was later announced the show would move to Versus.

===Najai Turpin suicide===
On February 14, 2005, one of the 16 contenders, Najai Turpin, despondent over personal matters, committed suicide, shooting himself while sitting with his girlfriend in a parked car outside the West Philadelphia gym where he trained. In his memory, the producers set up a trust fund for his daughter Anyae. The show still aired in its entirety, with a special tribute to Turpin.

== Seasons ==
==Broadcast==
The show ran for fifteen weeks through 2005 on NBC in the United States of America. The show ran in the UK on ITV2 and was repeated later in the week on ITV, and now airs on ITV4. It also aired on AXN in India, and on the Spanish language network Telemundo. The second season, featuring welterweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, July 18, 2006, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN. The third season, featuring super middleweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Tuesday, September 4, 2007, at 10 pm ET/PT, on ESPN. The fourth season, featuring cruiserweight contenders, premiered in the U.S. on Wednesday, December 3, 2008, at 10 pm ET/PT, on Versus. A fifth season produced by Mark Burnett and hosted by Andre Ward aired on Epix in 2018.
