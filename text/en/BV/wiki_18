<text>Fabry disease, also known as Anderson–Fabry disease, is a rare genetic disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the kidneys, heart, brain, and skin. Fabry disease is one of a group of conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases. The genetic mutation that causes Fabry disease interferes with the function of an enzyme that processes biomolecules known as sphingolipids, leading to these substances building up in the walls of blood vessels and other organs. It is inherited in an X-linked manner.

Fabry disease is sometimes diagnosed using a blood test that measures the activity of the affected enzyme called alpha-galactosidase, but genetic testing is also sometimes used, particularly in females.

The treatment for Fabry disease varies depending on the organs affected by the condition, and the underlying cause can be addressed by replacing the enzyme that is lacking.

The first descriptions of the condition were made simultaneously by dermatologist Johannes Fabry and the surgeon William Anderson in 1898.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to diagnose; the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses. Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages.

===Pain===
Full-body or localized pain to the extremities (known as acroparesthesia) or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is common in patients with Fabry disease. This pain can increase over time. This acroparesthesia is believed to be related to the damage of peripheral nerve fibers that transmit pain. Gastrointestinal tract pain is likely caused by the accumulation of lipids in the small vasculature of the GI tract, which obstructs blood flow and causes pain.

===Kidney===
Kidney complications are common and serious effects of the disease; chronic kidney disease and kidney failure may worsen throughout life. The presence of protein in the urine (which causes foamy urine) is often the first sign of kidney involvement. End-stage kidney failure in those with Fabry disease typically occurs in the third decade of life and is a common cause of death due to the disease.

===Heart===
Fabry disease can affect the heart in several ways. The accumulation of sphingolipids within heart muscle cells causes an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle or hypertrophy. This hypertrophy can cause the heart muscle to become abnormally stiff and unable to relax, leading to a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causing shortness of breath.

Fabry disease can also affect how the heart conducts electrical impulses, leading to both abnormally slow heart rhythms such as complete heart block, and abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia. These abnormal heart rhythms can cause blackouts, palpitations, or even sudden cardiac death.

Sphingolipids can also build up within the heart valves, thickening the valves and affecting the way they open and close. If severe, this can cause the valves to leak (regurgitation) or restrict the forward flow of blood (stenosis). The aortic and mitral valves are more commonly affected than the valves on the right side of the heart.

===Skin===
Angiokeratomas (tiny, painless papules that can appear on any region of the body, but are predominant on the thighs, around the navel, buttocks, lower abdomen, and groin) are common.

Anhidrosis (lack of sweating) is a common symptom, and less commonly hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).

Additionally, patients can exhibit Raynaud&#x27;s disease-like symptoms with neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain).

Ocular involvement may be present showing cornea verticillata (also known as vortex keratopathy), i.e. clouding of the corneas. Keratopathy may be the presenting feature in asymptomatic patients and must be differentiated from other causes of vortex keratopathy (e.g. drug deposition in the cornea). This clouding does not affect vision.

Other ocular findings can include conjunctival and retinal vascular abnormalities and anterior/posterior spoke-like cataracts. Visual reduction from these manifestations is uncommon.

===Other manifestations===
Fatigue, neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain, red hands and feet on and off), cerebrovascular effects leading to an increased risk of stroke - early strokes, mostly vertebrobasilar system tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo, nausea, inability to gain weight, chemical imbalances, and diarrhea are other common symptoms.

==Causes==
Fabry disease is caused by a DNA sequence (gene) that is not functioning as it should. A person who inherits this gene does not have enough of a functioning enzyme known as alpha-galactosidase A. The lack of alpha-galactosidase leads to Fabry disease. A deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (a-GAL A, encoded by &quot;GLA&quot;) due to mutation causes a glycolipid known as globotriaosylceramide (abbreviated as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside) to accumulate within the blood vessels, other tissues, and organs. This accumulation leads to an impairment of their proper functions.

At least 443 disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene have been discovered. The DNA mutations that cause the disease are X-linked recessive with incomplete penetrance in heterozygous females. The condition affects hemizygous males (i.e. all non-intersex males), as well as homozygous, and in many cases heterozygous females. While males typically experience severe symptoms, women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms. Research suggests many women experience severe symptoms ranging from early cataracts or strokes to hypertrophic left ventricular heart problems and kidney failure. This variability is thought to be due to X-inactivation patterns during embryonic development of the female.

== Mechanism ==
Fabry disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency is a result of an accumulation of glycosphingolipids found in the lysosomes and most cell types and tissues, which leads it to be considered a multisystem disease. Indications include painful crisis, angiokeratomas, corneal dystrophy, and hypohidrosis. In severe cases there is renal, cerebrovascular, and cardiac involvement and it is predominately responsible for premature mortality in Fabry patients. Fabry disease is X-linked and manifests mostly in homozygous males but also in heterozygous females. Cardiac involvement is recurrent in Fabry patients. Patients have developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. Deficient activity of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) within lysosomes, that is believed to trigger a cascade of cellular events. The demonstration of marked alpha-galactosidase deficiency is the conclusive method for the diagnosis in homozygous males. It may be detected in heterozygous females, but it is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, so molecular testing (genotyping) of females is mandatory.

==Diagnosis==
Fabry disease is suspected based on the individual&#x27;s clinical presentation and can be diagnosed by an enzyme assay (usually done on leukocytes) to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase activity. An enzyme assay is not reliable for the diagnosis of disease in females due to the random nature of X-inactivation. Molecular genetic analysis of the &quot;GLA&quot; gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis in females, particularly if the mutations have already been identified in male family members. Many disease-causing mutations have been noted. Kidney biopsy may also be suggestive of Fabry disease if excessive lipid buildup is noted. Pediatricians, as well as internists, commonly misdiagnose Fabry disease. All immediate and extended family members in the same family have the same family mutation, so if one member of a family has a DNA sequence analysis performed, other members of the family can be diagnosed by performing a targeted sequence analysis instead of testing the entire gene. Targeted sequencing is quicker and less expensive to perform. One study reported that for every first diagnosis in a family, on average five more family members (immediate and extended) are also diagnosed.

MRI is accurate in accessing left ventricular mass and thickness and hypertrophy. Late gadolinium enhancement shows an increased signal of the mid wall at the inferolateral wall of the base of the left ventricle, usually in the non-hypertrophic ventricle. T1-weighted imaging can show low T1 signal due to sphingolipid storage in the heart even without ventricular hypertrophy in 40% of those affected by the disease. Thus, MRI is a useful way of diagnosing the disease early. T2 signal is increased in inflammation and oedema.

==Treatment==
The treatments available for Fabry disease can be divided into therapies that aim to correct the underlying problem of decreased activity of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme and thereby reduce the risk of organ damage, and therapies to improve symptoms and life expectancy once organ damage has already occurred.

=== Therapies targeting enzyme activity ===
* Enzyme replacement therapy is designed to provide the enzyme the patient is missing as a result of a genetic malfunction. This treatment is not a cure, but can partially prevent disease progression, and potentially reverse some symptoms. , three medical drugs based on enzyme replacement therapy are available for Fabry disease:
** Agalsidase alfa, sold under the brand name Replagal by the company Takeda (since its acquisition of the company Shire), is a recombinant form of alpha-galactosidase A It received approval in the EU in 2001. FDA approval was applied for the United States. However, Shire withdrew their application for approval in the United States in 2012, citing that the agency will require additional clinical trials before approval. , Replagal has not received FDA approval.
** Agalsidase beta, sold under the brand name Fabrazyme by the company Sanofi, is another recombinant form of alpha-galactosidase. Like replagal, it received approval in the EU in 2001. In 2003, it was the first treatment for Fabry disease to be approved by the FDA.
** Pegunigalsidase alfa (Elfabrio) was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2023.
: Clinically, agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta are generally similar in effectiveness and safety, however they have never been compared directly in a randomized trial. Both are given by intravenous infusion every two weeks. They are available in Europe and in many other parts of the world, but treatment costs remain very high.
* Pharmacological chaperone therapy is another strategy to maintain enzyme activity. It does so by assisting correct folding of alpha-galactosidase despite the mutations that cause Fabry disease. , one medical drug based on pharmacological chaperone therapy is available for Fabry disease:
** Migalastat, sold under the brand name Galafold by the company Amicus Therapeutics, is a pharmacological chaperone that can stabilize many mutant forms of alpha-galactosidase. It is taken by mouth. In a randomized trial comparing Migalastat with enzyme replacement therapy, the efficacy and safety of both treatments were similar. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Galafold orphan drug status in 2004, and the European Commission followed in 2006. The European Medicines Agency&#x27;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted the drug a marketing approval under the name Galafold in May 2016. FDA approval followed in 2018.
* Experimental therapies that are not approved for treatment include the following:
** A gene therapy treatment that is in early-phase clinical trials, with the technology licensed to AvroBio.
** The substrate reduction therapy Venglustat (Ibiglustat) under development by Sanofi-Genzyme
** Bio-better ERT (CDX-6311) under pre-clinical development by the company Codexis
** A gene therapy (ST-920) under development by the company Sangamo.
** A nucleoside-modified RNA treatment that has shown efficacy in a mouse model of Fabry disease and in cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Fabry disease.

=== Organ-specific treatment ===
Pain associated with Fabry disease may be partially alleviated by enzyme replacement therapy in some patients, but pain management regimens may also include analgesics, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, though the latter are usually best avoided in kidney disease. The kidney failure seen in some of those with Fabry disease sometimes requires haemodialysis. The cardiac complications of Fabry disease include abnormal heart rhythms, which may require a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, while the restrictive cardiomyopathy often seen may require diuretics.

==Prognosis==
Life expectancy with Fabry disease for males was 58.2 years, compared with 74.7 years in the general population, and for females 75.4 years compared with 80.0 years in the general population, according to registry data from 2001 to 2008. The most common cause of death was cardiovascular disease, and most of those had received kidney replacements.

==Epidemiology==
Fabry disease is panethnic, but due to its rarity, determining an accurate disease frequency is difficult. Reported incidences, ranging from one in 476,000 to one in 117,000 in the general population, may largely underestimate the true prevalence. Newborn screening initiatives have found an unexpectedly high prevalence of the disease, as high as one in about 3,100 newborns in Italy, and have identified a surprisingly high frequency of newborn males around one in 1,500 in Taiwan.

== Research ==
* Enzyme replacement therapy: Replacement of the missing enzyme to clear the lipids (GL-3) from the cells
* Substrate synthesis inhibition, also called substrate reduction therapy: Inhibits the production of the lipid (GL-3) that accumulates in the cells
* Chaperone therapy: Uses small-molecule drugs that bind to the defective enzyme and stabilize it to increase enzyme activity and increase cellular function
* Gene editing: Technology that can potentially cut and fix a broken gene in a cell
* Gene therapy: Genetically modifies the affected cells to produce the missing enzyme.

== History ==
Fabry disease was first described by dermatologist Johannes Fabry and surgeon William Anderson independently in 1898. It was recognised to be due to abnormal storage of lipids in 1952. In the 1960s, the inheritance pattern was established as being X-linked, as well as the molecular defect responsible for causing the accumulation of glycolipids.

Ken Hashimoto published his classic paper on his electron microscopic findings in Fabry disease in 1965.

The first specific treatment for Fabry disease was approved in 2001.

<text>Pacific Highway is the name of several north–south highways in the Pacific Coast region of the Western United States, either by legislation officially designating it as such or by common usage.

==Description==
Good roads advocate and road-building pioneer Sam Hill was perhaps the main motivating force behind building the original Pacific Highway as a &quot;national auto trail&quot;; from Blaine, Washington, on the Canada–United States border, where he would build his Peace Arch, through Oregon to the Siskiyou Mountains of northwestern California. The road was built in the early 20th century—long before the United States Numbered Highway System was established. In 1926, its of pavement made it the longest continuous stretch of paved road in the world at the time. The Pacific Highway later extended north to Vancouver, British Columbia, and south through San Francisco to San Diego in Southern California.

The Pacific Highway auto trail became British Columbia Highway 99 from Vancouver to the Canada–United States border, U.S. Route 99 from the border to Red Bluff, California, in the Sacramento Valley; U.S. Route 99W from Red Bluff to Davis, California, in the Central Valley; U.S. Route 40 from Davis to San Francisco; and U.S. Route 101 from San Francisco to San Diego. This alignment is now mostly Interstate 5 in California, except between Woodland, and Los Angeles, where it uses State Route 113, Interstate 80 and then U.S. Route 101. Several routes are named Pacific Highway.
In Oregon, Interstate 5 is now officially the Pacific Highway No. 1 (see Oregon highways and routes). First completed in 1923, Oregon&#x27;s Pacific Highway was the first border-to-border paved highway west of the Mississippi River.

In California, Interstate 5 (Oregon&#x27;s Pacific Highway) immediately becomes the Cascade Wonderland Highway as soon as it crosses the border, as far as Red Bluff, south of Redding. South from there, it takes on other names such as West Side Freeway or Golden State Freeway, through southern California. The name &quot;Pacific Highway&quot; only currently corresponds with I-5, for a limited stretch of Interstate 5, in Oregon and part of Washington, but not in California. An old freeway section of U.S. Route 101 parallel to Interstate 5 near San Diego International Airport is known as &quot;Pacific Highway,&quot; and is now locally maintained.

==History==
An extensive section of the Pacific Highway (over ), from approximately Stockton, California to Vancouver, Washington, followed very closely the track of the Siskiyou Trail. The Siskiyou Trail was based on an ancient network of Native American footpaths connecting the Pacific Northwest with California&#x27;s Central Valley.

By the 1820s, trappers from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of the future Pacific Highway to move between today&#x27;s state of Washington and &quot;Alta California&quot;. During the second half of the 19th Century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the Central Pacific Railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.

In the early 20th century, around 1910, entrepreneur Sam Hill lobbied the governments of Washington and Oregon to build automobile roads along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, with the ultimate goal of building a paved auto route from Alaska to Mexico. Hill formed the Pacific Highway Association with himself as president and influential supporters from Alaska to California to serve as officers, including attorney Falcon Joslin of Fairbanks, Alaska, member of parliament Alfred Thompson of Dawson, Yukon Territory, mayor Albert E. Todd of Victoria, British Columbia, Frank M. Fretwell of Seattle, Washington, and attorney Frank Branch Riley of Portland, Oregon.

<text>Narrandera, ( ) until around 1949 also spelled &quot;Narandera&quot;, is a town located in the central Riverina region of south-western New South Wales, Australia. The town lies on the junction of the Newell and Sturt highways, adjacent to the Murrumbidgee River, and it is considered the gateway to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. At the 2016 census, Narrandera had a population of 3746 people.

==History==
Narrandera is a river town with a rich heritage. Captain Charles Sturt is credited with being the first European to observe the area that later was to become known as Narrandera. However Sturt, who passed through the district on 12 December 1829, was not the first explorer to cast eyes on the Murrumbidgee River. The upper Murrumbidgee, the &quot;Big Water&quot;, was first noted in April 1821 by Charles Throsby. The name &quot;Narrandera&quot; is derived from the Wiradjuri word &quot;nharrang&quot;, meaning &quot;frill-necked lizard&quot;. and the name of the local Narrungderah clan.

=== Massacre of Narrungderah people ===
The local Aboriginal people of the Wiradjuri nation, were all but destroyed by settlement, disease brought by European settlers, and clashes with the settlers. The last blow was a massacre of the remainder of the Narrungderah clan by a small group of European settlers near what is now referred to as Massacre, or Murdering Island, and is known to have left only one survivor. The people of the Wiradjuri nation who now reside in Narrandera make up ten percent of the population of the town, and predominantly came from the regions south and west of Narrandera, but were dislocated by colonial expansion.

=== Settlement ===
Narrandera had its first recorded mention as a pastoral station or &quot;run&quot; (Narrandera Run) in 1848, at which time the property held by Edward Flood comprised approximately .

In 1850, surveyor James Larmer reserved a site for what would later become Narrandera. The township developed in the early 1860s. Gillenbah post office opened nearby on 1 March 1859 and was replaced by the Narrandera office in 1861. A Gillenbah office was open from 1881 to 1892 and from 1906 to 1941.

The Borough of Narrandera was constituted by proclamation dated 17 March 1885, and gazetted the following day. The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985.

===1945 RAAF crash===
On 3 September 1945, a Royal Australian Air Force Bristol Beaufighter assigned to No. 92 Squadron crashed into the canal at the western end of the town during a joy flight, killing all seven people on board.

=== 2013 sesquicentenary ===
A celebratory weekend event to mark Narrandera&#x27;s sesquicentenary, named &quot;Back to Narrandera 1863 to 2013&quot;, was held in early October 2013. The Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir , who was born in Narrandera, opened the celebrations at a luncheon. During her speech of proclamation she acknowledged the indigenous custodians of the land, and noted that the name &quot;Narrandera&quot; is a Wiradjuri word for &quot;the place of lizard or goanna&quot;. Bashir informed the luncheon guests that 150 years ago &#x27;on this site on the Murrumbidgee River, the beautiful place was officially proclaimed as a town named Narrandera&#x27;. Included on the program of events and activities for the celebrations were the Parkside Cottage Museum was open for most of the weekend and displayed many historical artefacts, including archival resources about the P.S. &quot;Wagga Wagga&quot;; the Murrumbidgee Sheepdog Championships were held; there were Narrandera Cemeteries Heritage Walks; a cocktail party; and a Chinese exhibition. There was also a Railway Memorabilia Display with Vintage Train Rides and the John O&#x27;Brien Heritage House was opened to the public; there was a vintage film evening; a classic ball; a &quot;Back to the 60&#x27;s Dance&quot;; the Lions Club held a recovery breakfast; and a &quot;Ye Olde Town Picnic&quot; followed; with other events, including a CWA Devonshire Tea; a farmers&#x27; market; and a time capsule was sealed and placed under the Narrandera Clock Tower. The new Rocky Waterholes Bridge was also opened.

== Heritage listings ==
Narrandera has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Elizabeth Street: Narrandera Showground Industrial Hall
* Junee-Hay railway: Murrumbidgee River railway bridge
* Murrumbidgee River: Berembed Weir
* 30–32 Twynam Street: Derrendi
* Whitton Street (Newell Highway): Narrandera railway station
* Murrumbidgee River near: Gogeldrie Weir

==Narrandera today==
The town of Narrandera is located adjacent to the Murrumbidgee River, at the intersection of the Newell Highway and the Sturt Highway at the centre of a diversely productive agricultural region. Its attractive tree-lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it.

Narrandera now marks the transition between an extensive dry-land area devoted to cereal crops and sheep and wool production to the east, and, to the west, the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) fed by water from the Burrinjuck Dam. The MIA is a region where irrigation has opened the way to a diversity of enterprise, from the growing of rice and other cereals under irrigation to the production of citrus, wine grapes, potatoes, and increasingly, cotton and nuts.

The Narrandera Memorial Gardens include the unusual Hankinson Fountain. Manufactured by the Royal Doulton Company of England, the ceramic fountain is one of only two known to be in existence, the other located in Pakistan. It was given to the people of Narrandera by Alderman and Mrs Hankinson in 1922 in honour of locals who served in World War I.

Narrandera is known for its waterways described below, but in particular for the Lake Talbot Water Park. The waterpark is set in an amphitheatre of shaded lawns. The Water Park features a 50-metre pool, a large children&#x27;s pool, an infants pool and a water playground as well two giant water-slides. It adjoins Lake Talbot, which is fed by the Bundidgerry Creek. The Lake is used by swimmers water-skiers and canoeists.

The Narrandera Flora and Fauna reserve is home to a Koala Regeneration Reserve. The reserve was set up in the 1970s to return Koalas to the town as they had been wiped out in the region by 1950 through accidental poisoning and through the fur export industry. There are now several hundred healthy Koala in the Reserve and they have bred and spread for many kilometres beyond Narrandera. Kangaroos are also well represented in the Reserve.

Narrandera&#x27;s immediate surrounds feature a number of waterways, the major waterway being the Murrumbidgee River. Others include Lake Talbot, the Narrandera Wetlands, Bundidgerry Creek, and the ephemeral Lake Coolah.

The town also has number of historic features, such as a fig tree on the corner of King and Cadell Streets, which is thought to be 150 years old; and the Mon Repos, a residence built in a Queen Anne-style, which was built in the 1890s. The Oakbank Brewery Tower located beside the Murrumbidgee on Oakbank Road is a prominent feature, once owned by Lincolns brewers, then by Oakbank Brewery. Its last productive days were as a cordial (soft drink) factory owned by the Webster family of Narrandera.

Narrandera Parkside Museum houses a cloak made from the first bale of Merino wool sent back to England by the MacArthur family.

The Irrigation Canal which flows through the town carries water to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area to Narrandera&#x27;s west. It originates east at Berembed Weir where water is diverted from the Murrumbidgee River. The canal follows the natural bed of Bundidgerry Creek and in places spreads wide and has no levee banks. Lake Talbot was formed in 1924 when the bank of the Irrigation Canal gave way, flooding the river flat between the canal and Bundidgerry Hill. The shallow body of water was allowed to remain and became an important recreational feature of the town. A wetland has been created off Lizard Drive, only from the Murrumbidgee River. The Wetland acts as a collection point for storm water run-off from the town.

==Climate==
Narrandera has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with a substantial range in maximum temperatures throughout the year, typical of the Riverina. Summers are long, hot and very sunny with the occasional severe thunderstorm and/or cold front. Winter is cool, partly cloudy and features many days of light, misty drizzle and fog which can persist for multiple days in a row. Snow is virtually unknown in the modern climate, having last occurred on 23 June 1908, 27 July 1901 and 8 August 1899.

==Transport==
Narrandera is well served for transport. The Sturt Highway and the Newell Highway cross just south of Narrandera. Narrandera Airport is west of the town, and is serviced by Rex Airlines, operating return services daily to Sydney, approximately one hour and 20 minutes&#x27; flying time away.

Narrandera is served by a twice-weekly NSW TrainLink Xplorer service operating between Sydney and Griffith. NSW TrainLink also operate a road coach service from Wagga Wagga to Griffith via Coolamon.

==Sports==
Narrandera has a rugby league team competing in the Group 17 competition. Founded in 1921 and known as the Lizards, the club previously disbanded in 2005, leaving Group 20. This left the town with no rugby league club from 2006-2011 and 2015-17. After briefly amalgamating with neighbouring club Yanco-Wamoon to form Bidgee Hurricanes (2012–14), the club reformed independently in 2018 and joined the reformed Group 17. The club has three premierships from their time in Group 20 (1986, 1991, 1999) and two from Group 17 in 2022, which broke a 23-year drought, and 2023.

The Narrandera Eagles (formerly and still officially Narrandera Imperials Football Club) compete in the Riverina Football League, winning premierships in 1986 and 2012. Formerly of the South West competition, the club won 15 titles in that league.

Narrandera also has strong local cricket and basketball competitions.

<text>Magnus Mills (born in 1954 in Birmingham) is an English fiction writer and bus driver. He is best known for his first novel, &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot;, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and praised by Thomas Pynchon.

==Background==
Magnus Mills was born in Birmingham and brought up in Bristol. After graduating with an economics degree from Wolverhampton Polytechnic, he started a master&#x27;s degree course at the University of Warwick but dropped out before completion.

Between 1979 and 1986 he built high-tensile fences for a living. In 1986 Mills moved to London and became a bus driver, which continues to be his full-time job alongside writing. During this time he wrote a regular column about being a bus driver for &quot;The Independent&quot;, claiming he was replaced by the serial &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;.&quot; In 1998 he drew on his experience as a fence builder for his first novel, &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot;. Some newspapers reported that he received an advance of £1 million for his debut; he later said the real figure was closer to £10,000. &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot; was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Whitbread First Novel Award in 1998. It won him the McKitterick Prize in 1999, and earned a rare jacket quote from reclusive author Thomas Pynchon, who called it &quot;a demented, deadpan comic wonder&quot;.

Following the surprise success of &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;All Quiet on the Orient Express&quot;, Mills quit work as a bus driver for four months as a &quot;project&quot; to see if he could make it as a full-time writer. &quot;Three to See the King&quot;, published in 2001, was the result. It received positive reviews. He then worked as a van driver for several years, which resulted in &quot;The Scheme for Full Employment&quot;, published in 2003, but which had a more mixed reception. He was laid off from his job due to cutbacks and returned to working as a bus driver. His 2005 novel &quot;Explorers of the New Century&quot; was released to good reviews from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, and other papers. Having written his first four novels for Flamingo, &quot;Explorers of the New Century&quot; marked a new partnership with Bloomsbury. 

Mills has also written two books of very short stories: &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot; and &quot;Only When the Sun Shines Brightly&quot; for Acorn Books. His experience as a bus driver informed the content of his 2009 novel &quot;The Maintenance of Headway&quot;, the title of which refers to keeping buses equally spaced on their routes. His 2011 novel &quot;A Cruel Bird Came to the Nest and Looked In&quot; depicts a kingdom whose king has gone missing without explanation, leaving an absurdist realm &quot;lost in an English fairy-tale world.&quot;

Mills&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot; was shortlisted for the 2015 Goldsmiths Prize.

==Style==
Mills&#x27;s style has been called &quot;deceptively&quot; simple. His prose style is rhythmic, often repetitious, and his humour is deadpan. He favours short sentences, little description and a lot of dialogue. Mills has cited Primo Levi as a key influence.

==Themes==
Mills&#x27;s books usually feature one or more working-class men as protagonists. In &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot;, an unnamed supervisor works alongside two Scottish fence-builders as they move from location to location building high-tensile steel fences. The theme of repetition is established early on, as the men fall into a routine of working during the day, going to the local pub at night and &quot;accidentally&quot; killing people along the way. The same kind of skewed repetition occurs in Mills&#x27;s later works &quot;All Quiet on the Orient Express&quot; and &quot;The Scheme for Full Employment&quot;. &quot;All Quiet on the Orient Express&quot; is about a man who stops at a campsite in the Lake District to kill some time before embarking on a journey on the Orient Express. Gradually, he becomes involved in the local community and is offered jobs until it becomes clear that he may never leave. &quot;The Scheme for Full Employment&quot; tells of a &quot;beautiful&quot; scheme whereby people are employed to drive around on set routes, stopping at depots to offload the contents of their vans.

Freedom of will is a key theme in his work. What do the fences in &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot; suggest? Who, or what are the &quot;beasts&quot;? Can the protagonist of &quot;All Quiet on the Orient Express&quot; ever assert his freedom? Does it exist? This theme is explored most vividly in &quot;Three to See the King&quot;, whose characters live in a largely allegorical world that lacks many of the identifiable conventions of working-class life – they don&#x27;t have jobs, pubs or anything more than a rudimentary social network. The main character attempts to establish simple freedom for himself within his small, beloved house, only to find himself at the mercy of unsolicited relationships and the ideology of a charismatic newcomer. Like most of Mills&#x27;s characters, he remains desperately attached to his routine, attempting to meet each twist with a calm, reasonable approach, until it becomes impossible. In &quot;Explorers of the New Century&quot;, the characters begin as masters of their mules and the art of exploration, but as their journey continues, the harsh climate and terrain of the land strip them of control over their own destinies. At the outset of the book, the explorers are able to assign or deny freedom to their mules; by the end, most of the explorers are dependent on the mules for their own freedom.

Mills himself has talked about punishment and reward as being key themes in his work, particularly in &quot;The Restraint of Beasts&quot;. The leaders of the teams in &quot;Explorers of the New Century&quot; struggle with punishment as a means of encouraging and disciplining their mules, never able to achieve quite the results they desire, but fearful of interacting with the mules by any means more complex than punishment and reward.

<text>Anna Brandoli (born 25 July 1945) is an Italian female comic book artist.

== Early life ==
Anna Brandoli was born in Milan, Italy on July 25, 1945, as World War II was coming to an end. At age fourteen, Brandoli started working in a ceramic warehouse and attended an evening school known as Scuola del Castello. She attended an evening school as an alternative so that she could work during the day. Brandoli studied advertisement graphics at Scuola del Castello while she tried a number of jobs on the side. Eventually, Brandoli settled in the Knorr internal office, where she illustrated brochures for sellers. After advertising, she turned to comic making and eventually collaborates with scenarist Renato Queirolo. They worked together to make comics that took inspiration from researched historical settings and imagination combined to create stories of adventure. Brandoli illustrations included different topics in their comics such as symbolism of power and protagonists that overlap with ideals of the feminist movement.

==Biography==
Born in Milan, Brandoli made her debut in 1977 in &quot;Alter Alter&quot; magazine. For that magazine, she drew &quot;La Strega&quot; (&quot;The Witch&quot;) with Renato Queirolo, who became her main scenarist. This comic was translated in many languages including French (published by Glénat), Danish (published by Carlsen), and Swedish (published by Medusa). In Sweden it is called &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which was the name of the comic&#x27;s heroine. Together, Brandoli and Queirolo also published two albums for a younger audience: &quot;Colorina&quot; and &quot;Il Mago di Oz&quot; (The Wizard of Oz).

In 1981, Brandoli started the &quot;I Testamenti di Sant&#x27;Ambrogio (Rebecca)&quot; series in the magazine &quot;Linus&quot;. This series narrates the adventures of a woman living in the 15th century Italy. The series was continued in &quot;Orient Express&quot; and &quot;Comic Art&quot;.

In 1988, she produced &quot;Alias&quot; for &quot;Isola Trovata&quot;, again with Queirolo.

She also started the &quot;Cuba 42&quot; series with writer Ottavio De Angelis, set in the Second World War.

<doc id="614005" wikidata="Q16014255" url="?curid=614005" title="The Infamous Mobb Deep">
<text>The Infamous Mobb Deep is the eighth and final studio album by American hip hop duo Mobb Deep, which is composed of Havoc and Prodigy. The album was released on April 1, 2014, by Prodigy&#x27;s Infamous Records and Sony&#x27;s RED Distribution. &quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; is a double album that consists of one disc of new original music and another of unreleased tracks from the recording sessions from their second studio album &quot;The Infamous&quot; (1995). The album had been in development since 2011, but was delayed by a feud that occurred between Havoc and Prodigy during 2012. However, they shortly reconciled.

The duo toured to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut studio album during 2013. This led to the two reconvening to get back into the album&#x27;s recording process. The album&#x27;s production was handled by Havoc, Boi-1da, Illmind and The Alchemist among others. The album contains guest appearances from French Montana, Juicy J, The LOX, Bun B, Busta Rhymes, Nas, and Snoop Dogg among others. The 1994 &quot;Infamous&quot; Sessions contains guest appearances from Big Noyd, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, and Nas. The album was supported by the singles &quot;Taking You off Here&quot; and &quot;Say Something&quot;.

==Background and development==
In 2006, Mobb Deep released its seventh studio album &quot;Blood Money&quot; under 50 Cent&#x27;s G-Unit Records and Interscope Records. For over the following years, the duo released various solo projects, songs and EPs, while revealing plans for their eighth studio album. However, on July 27, 2012, Havoc informed AllHipHop; the duo was on an indefinite hiatus. Members Havoc and Prodigy had dis-united, after Havoc attacked Prodigy on Twitter, and eventually a sound clip leaked on the internet of him insulting Prodigy during their concert at SXSW. Initially, Havoc claimed his accounts were hacked. However, he later admitted it was him, as he saw Twitter as an inadequate place to solve a conflict. He also stated he had a Prodigy diss track recorded.

In January 2013, Prodigy revealed he was sure he would record with Havoc in the future. The 2013&#x27;s Paid Dues lineup then revealed Mobb Deep would be rejoining to perform at the March 30, 2013 event. They were later confirmed to be reuniting for Paid Dues and an international 20th anniversary tour starting in May 2013. On March 22, 2013, Havoc and Prodigy officially reunited for an interview, and touched base on the turmoil between them. Prodigy stated &quot;At the end of the day, the music is the most important thing and our love for each other it&#x27;s only right we&#x27;re gonna get right back to work.&quot;

The album was then revealed to be a double album on December 17, 2013, with the second disc containing unreleased tracks and recording sessions from the duo&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Infamous&quot;. Prodigy stated that the album would be released during March 2014 and it would now be titled &quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot;. He later said the whole project would be getting back to their original gritty New York sound. Prodigy explained to &quot;XXL&quot;; &quot;I would just say, our signature sound is a dark, sinister-type of sound. There&#x27;s certain things we&#x27;re going through in our lives right now, and the lyrics are just up to date. Everything that we&#x27;re saying is going on right now. Each album is like that, it&#x27;s a time capsule of that time period. So now in 2014, you&#x27;re gonna hear what we&#x27;re going through in our lyrics, what&#x27;s going through our head as grown men.&quot;

==Recording and production==
In May 2011, Havoc announced that they were recording their self-titled eighth studio album. He revealed that the album would contain production from himself, The Alchemist, Sid Roams, DJ Premier, MTK, Cardiak and the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, as well as other guest appearances from rappers such as, Lil&#x27; Kim, Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, Odd Future and Nas on the album.

Around the May 2013 release of Havoc&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;13&quot;, Havoc announced that he and Prodigy had been in the studio for over a month working on their eighth studio album, which he stated was already &quot;halfway done.&quot; He also mentioned that he would be doing the entire production on the album. On August 6, 2013, Prodigy announced that they had finished nine songs for the album, and confirmed the album would be titled &quot;Mobb Deep&quot;. On November 4, 2013, Prodigy revealed that The Alchemist, and possibly Action Bronson and Earl Sweatshirt would be among the few guest appearances on the album.

In a January 2014 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot;, record producer Boi-1da confirmed working significantly on the album saying, &quot;It&#x27;s new-age with that old Mobb twist to it. I was a big fan of Mobb Deep and Havoc&#x27;s production, so I just reached out and me and him have been producing records together, sending stuff back and forth. I can say that I have some records on the new Mobb Deep album that me and Havoc did together. It&#x27;s something I knocked off my bucket list.&quot; During an interview with &quot;XXL&quot; and Prodigy later that month, he stated that Havoc, The Alchemist, Illmind and Boi-1da would provide production on the album. He also elaborated on the unreleased material saying that it would contain never before heard skits and verses by Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Nas, N.O.R.E. and Mobb Deep. Prodigy then confirmed in March 2014, that the album would feature rappers Bun B and Juicy J on a song called &quot;Legendary&quot;. The track listing revealed guest appearances on the album from French Montana, The LOX, Bun B, Juicy J, Mack Wilds, Big Noyd, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.

==Release and promotion==
On November 21, 2011, the duo released an EP titled &quot;Black Cocaine&quot;. On January 10, 2014, Mobb Deep began touring on The Infamous Mobb Deep concert tour in promotion of the album. The 31-date North American leg of the tour will run until May 2, 2014. They will follow those dates with a European leg of the tour in the months following. On February 18, 2014, the duo released the cover artwork for the album.

On February 18, 2014, Mobb Deep revealed the album&#x27;s cover artwork and a release date of April 1, 2014 for the album. Additionally, PledgeMusic took deluxe edition pre-orders for the album that gave customers the chance to receive signed T-shirts and vinyl, as well as unique experiences such as VIP drinks with Prodigy, a PledgeMusic-only show, a limited edition Infamous bike, and access to unreleased tracks. Following this, the duo will release a super deluxe version which will include a re-mastered copy of the original &quot;Infamous&quot; album and a 2012 documentary produced by Red Bull. The super deluxe version will only be available as a physical copy.

===Singles===
The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Taking You Off Here&quot; was premiered on January 29, 2014 on New York&#x27;s Hot 97 radio station. It was the first official song release from the album. Then two days later the song was released for digital download. On March 5, 2014, the music video was released for &quot;Taking You Off Here&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Say Something&quot;, produced by Illmind, was released on March 12, 2014.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; was met with generally positive from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 70, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews,&quot; based on 7 reviews. Del F. Cowie of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a welcome return to form that sees the group addressing the weaknesses that had hastened whispers of their decline. Havoc shares the beat-making duties with carefully curated and Mobb-tailored contributions from Illmind and Alchemist, as well as Canadians Boi-1da and Kaytranada, and reins in any commercial overtures.&quot; Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Christopher R. Weingarten commented &quot;The duo&#x27;s mean, scrappy eighth album is the first to truly embrace their underdog status, wrapping itself in the low-fi, Walkman-ready vibe that has dominated the best of founding members Prodigy&#x27;s and Havoc&#x27;s solo work on indie labels.&quot; Chisom Uzosike of &quot;XXL&quot; gave the album an XL rating, saying &quot;&quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; is a must-have in a true Mobb Deep fan&#x27;s collection. Crafting such a quality hip-hop album, two decades after your magnum opus, is a remarkable feat. Such longevity in hip-hop is rare, and Prodigy and Havoc deserve their due respect. If this is Mobb Deep&#x27;s last album, this legendary duo couldn&#x27;t have chosen a much better way to go out.&quot;

Martin Caballero of &quot;USA Today&quot; said, &quot;Mobb Deep return to the spirit of its breakthrough album &quot;The Infamous&quot; on its eighth LP. That record established the Queens duo&#x27;s signature brand of nihilistic raps over intoxicatingly dark instrumentals, and now &quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; doesn&#x27;t stray far from that successful formula.&quot; Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX said, &quot;There are no fun and games here. Just business. Havoc and Prodigy are as dialed in as ever. &quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; is a return to the roots of their artistic consciousness, substantiated almost 20 years ago, and with fine precision. With an all-star cast of guest lyricists and a gang of producers, &quot;The Infamous Mobb Deep&quot; is a loud wake-up call for Hip Hop. The Rap game is survival of the fittest, and Mobb Deep still roams among the strong.&quot; Adam Wordkman of &quot;The National&quot; stated, &quot;While pairing classic with contemporary is risky, it&#x27;s an interesting demonstration of the development of Mobb Deep&#x27;s thuggish methodology. At two hours, though, the entire experience might test the patience of the uninitiated.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 7,100 copies in the United States.

<doc id="614012" wikidata="Q390226" url="?curid=614012" title="Australian Alps">
<text>The Australian Alps are a mountain range in southeast Australia. The range comprises an interim Australian bioregion, and is the highest mountain range in Australia. The range straddles the borders of eastern Victoria, southeastern New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It contains Australia&#x27;s only peaks exceeding in elevation, and is the only bioregion on the Australian mainland in which deep snow falls annually. The range comprises an area of .

The Australian Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range, the series of mountain and hill ranges and tablelands that runs about from northern Queensland, through New South Wales, and into the northern part of Victoria. This chain of highlands divides the drainage of the rivers that flow to the east into the Pacific Ocean from those that flow west into the drainage of the Murray–Darling Basin (and thence to the Southern Ocean) or into inland waters, such as Lake Eyre, which lie below sea level, or else evaporate rapidly.

The Australian Alps consist of two biogeographic sub regions: the Snowy Mountains, including the Brindabella Range, located in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory; and the Victorian Alps, located in Victoria. The latter region is also known as the &quot;High Country&quot;, particularly within a cultural or historical context.

==Geology==
Unlike the high mountain ranges found in places like the Rockies (highest peak ), the European Alps (highest peak ) or the Himalayas (highest peak ), the Australian Alps were not formed by two continental plates colliding and pushing up the Earth&#x27;s rocky mantle to form jagged, rocky peaks. Instead, the Australian Alps consist of a high plateau, with significantly softer rolling hills spread across a long, wide plateau that was lifted thousands of feet up by the movement of magma when Gondwana began to break up between 130 and 160 million years ago. The highest peak in the Australian Alps is Mount Kosciuszko ().

Formation of the Australian Alps was largely complete by around 100 million years ago, but during the past 90 million years, a number of minor uplift episodes occurred, with occasional eruptions of basalt lava from small volcanoes, which flowed across the landscape and down some of the valleys, filling in the low-lying areas to form the flat landscapes of these high plains.

During the Pleistocene ice age, commencing around 2 million years ago, when ice caps formed on many high ranges around the world, as well as at the poles, small glaciers were formed on the very highest parts of the Australian Alps, mostly in the vicinity of Mount Kosciuszko. Whilst no glaciers remain today, evidence of their past presence can be found in the numerous tarns and cirques found in that region, such as Club Lake, Blue Lake, and Hedley Tarn.

==Ecology==

The Australian Alps are important for conservation, recreation, and as a water drainage basin, with much of the range&#x27;s eastern slopes having its runoff diverted artificially into the Murray River and its tributary the Murrumbidgee River through the civil engineering project of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.

The range&#x27;s natural ecology is protected by large national parks, in particular the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales and the adjoining Alpine National Park in Victoria. These are managed cooperatively as the Australian Alps National Parks by agencies of the Australian government and the state governments of this region.

The Australian Alps also contain the only skiing areas of mainland Australia. Along with the town of Cabramurra, New South Wales, these are practically the only permanent settlements in the area. Several medium-sized towns can be found in the valleys below the foothills, such as Jindabyne, New South Wales, Corryong, Victoria, and Mount Beauty.

The Australian Alps are not as high or as steep as the European Alps, New Zealand&#x27;s Southern Alps, or the Andes Mountains, and most of their peaks can be reached without using mountaineering equipment. 

=== Wildlife ===
Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish live in the Australian Alps. There are approximately 40 native mammals, 200 bird species, 30 reptile species, 15 amphibians, 14 native fish species, and a wide variety of invertebrates. Additionally, many non-native, feral species have been introduced to the Alps, such as the European rabbit, deer, house mice, red foxes, dogs, cats, horses, and pigs. 

Among this wide variety of different species of wildlife, there are different habitat requirements for each of the mentioned species, regardless of whether it is native or introduced. In addition to rock outcrops and decaying logs, there is often vegetation that provides food and shelter or a combination of these factors. Consequently, topography, soil type, and temperature determine the type of vegetation in an area and how animal populations are distributed.

===Birds===
The Australian Alps have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. The range&#x27;s montane forests and woodlands support large breeding populations of flame robins and pilotbirds. 

=== Insects ===
The bogong moth seasonally migrates long distances towards and from the Australian Alps and gregariously aestivates in caves and other sites throughout the mountain range during the summer to avoid high temperatures and lack of larval food resources. The moth is a food source for many species living within the region, such as the endangered mountain pygmy possum. However, the moth has also been a biovector of arsenic, transporting it from lowland feeding sites over long distances into the mountains, leading to the bioaccumulation of the element in the environment and animals in the mountain range.

===Bushfires===
Due to their mostly hot, dry climate, bushfires in Australia occur frequently, particularly in the well-forested areas of the Australian Alps. The Alps, particularly on the Victorian side of the border (known as the Victorian Alps), are periodically subject to major bushfires and have been almost entirely burnt through by bushfires on various occasions, notably; Black Thursday in 1851, Black Friday (1939), and during fires in 2003 and 2006-07.

Certain native flora in Australia have evolved to rely on bushfires as a means of reproduction, and fire events are an interwoven and an essential part of the ecology of the continent. In some eucalypt and banksia species, for example, fire causes seed pods to open, allowing them to germinate. Fire also encourages the growth of new grassland plants. Other species have adapted to recover quickly from fire.

Nevertheless, damage to surrounding human habitations and native fauna can be extensive and occasionally catastrophic. The 2003 Canberra bushfires severely affected almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s pasture, forests (pine plantations), and nature parks. After burning for a week through the Brindabella Ranges above Canberra, the fires entered the suburbs of the city on 18 January 2003. Four people died and more than 500 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. The Victorian Black Saturday bushfires were particularly intense in parts of the Victorian High Country and destroyed several towns, including Kinglake and Marysville. The fires killed 173 people, Australia&#x27;s highest-ever loss of life from a bushfire. Statewide, the fires burned out over 400,000 hectares and destroyed 2,029 properties.

==Alpine huts==
Within the Australian Alps, the roughly 120 active alpine huts mostly date back to the early cattlemen&#x27;s days, early skiing huts, and early research and surveying huts. Many of these have remained in use by fly fishers (seasonal), hikers, and skiing groups throughout the year. Most of these huts are maintained by volunteers through the Kosciuszko Huts Association and the local National Parks and Wildlife Service.

Some of the more noteworthy huts include Moscow Villa Hut, Valentine Hut, Seaman&#x27;s Hut, and Mawsons Hut. In recent years many huts have been lost through lack of maintenance and bush fire, as occurred with the Pretty Plain Hut and Mount Franklin Chalet, which were destroyed by the Canberra bushfires of 2003.

==Resort skiing areas==

The Australian Alps are the main region in which skiing in Australia takes place (although skiing is also possible in Tasmania). Skiable terrain stretches through large areas of territory from June to October. New South Wales is home to Australia&#x27;s highest snow country, oldest ski fields, and largest resort. Recreational skiing in Australia began around 1861 at Kiandra, New South Wales, when Norwegian gold miners introduced the idea to the frozen hills around the town. The first and longest-surviving ski club in the world, the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club, is believed to have been formed at Kiandra in that year. Steeper slopes and more reliable snows lie further to the south, and in the 20th century the focus of recreational skiing in New South Wales shifted southward, to mountains in and around the Kosciuszko Main Range region, where Australia&#x27;s best vertical drop is found at Thredbo and Australia&#x27;s biggest resort, Perisher is now found. The State of Victoria is the one with the largest number of skiing areas in Australia.

Mount Bogong, with its peak at 1986 m above sea level, is the highest peak in Victoria. The surrounding Bogong High Plains is one of the largest areas of snow country in Australia. It includes the leading resorts of Falls Creek and Mount Hotham. Recreational and practical skiing was being practised in the Victorian Alps by the 1880s and 1890s with skis made from local timbers, and making use of single steering poles. Skiing began at Mount Buffalo in the 1890s, and a chalet was constructed in 1910. Australia&#x27;s first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1936.

Cross-country skiing is possible in the ACT, as well as in New South Wales and Victoria, but downhill skiing can only be done in New South Wales and Victoria:

<text>Pisco () is a city located in the Department of Ica of Peru, the capital of the Pisco Province. The city is around 9 metres (28 feet) above sea level. Pisco was founded in 1640, close to the indigenous emplacement of the same name. Pisco originally prospered because of its nearby vineyards and became noted for its grape brandy or pisco which was exported from its port. Pisco has an estimated population of 104,656 (est. 2015).

== History ==
=== Mid 16th Century: Pisco is Born ===
The town of Santa Maria Magdalena, which was founded in 1572, had a port named Pisco, after the name of the valley in which it was located. This port became an important route for distribution of the liqueur throughout Peru. Demand for the product grew as sailors from around the world who called into the Port of Pisco created an important international trade link and further demand for the product. Over time, the town of Santa Maria Magdalena became simply known as &#x27;Pisco&#x27; with the same name adopted for the grape liqueur produced from the area. In a few decades, Pisco was distributed along the entire coast of Peru and Chile, as well as being exported through ports in the Pacific and Europe.

=== 17th century ===
The city was highly populated until 1685, when it was pillaged by English pirates. The city suffered again in 1687 because of an earthquake. Vines are abundant, despite the sandy and infertile terrain; they grow in many places because of the moisture from inside the earth and provide Lima with its wines and grape concentrates that run along the various mountain provinces extending to Panama and Guayaquil.

Pisco was attacked by the pirates Clerck and David; in addition, in 1687 it was destroyed by an earthquake, which caused a tsunami to follow, destroying the city further. Viceroy Melchor Antonio Portocarrero Lazo de la Vega then moved it to its current location, reestablishing it in 1689 as &quot;Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Concordia de Pisco&quot;.

=== Independence of Peru ===
In 1820, the Liberating Expedition arrived in Pisco under the command of José de San Martín and Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Riquelme, disembarking in the Bay of Paracas, where the first flag and the first national emblem of Peru were created. In 1832, the Peruvian Congress ordered by law that the city of Lima would receive the title of &quot;Villa y Puerto de la Independencia&quot;, extending this qualification to both the town and the riverbank population. In 1868 the &quot;town of Pisco&quot; was designated capital of the new province of Chincha, and in 1898 it was elevated to the rank of &quot;city&quot;. In 1947, the historian pisqueño Mamerto Castillo Negrón said that Pisco had received two additions in its history that granted it honors worthy of merit, the first being &quot;Villa and Puerto de la Independencia&quot; and second, its recognition as a provincial capital.

=== 2007 earthquake ===
The city was very near the center of the devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake which struck south central Peru on Wednesday 15 August 2007. Media officials reported that 80% of the city was destroyed, including the central San Clemente Cathedral of Pisco, located in Plaza de Armas in which mass was taking place at the time of the earthquake. The resulting dead account for a reported 30 percent of the total fatalities caused by the earthquake. Several hundred more were killed throughout the city Several years on, the city is still recovering from the damage done during the earthquake.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The city of Pisco experiences hot arid climate, with warm temperatures and extremely low rainfall prevailing all year-round. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Pisco has a desert climate, abbreviated &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps. The average maximum temperature in the city is , ranging from a February peak of to a July low of . The average minimum temperature in the city is , fluctuating from to in the months of February and August respectively. Rainfall is extremely low; the average annual rainfall total amounts to a mere .

==Transport==
Pisco is served by the Capitán FAP Renán Elías Olivera Airport (IATA: PIO, ICAO: SPSO), located in Pisco (PIO). This international airport shares facilities with the Peruvian Air Force and is also designated as a back-up airport to the Jorge Chávez International Airport (IATA: LIM, ICAO: SPIM) in Lima, Peru. On September 4, 2012, President Ollanta Humala was present for the beginning of renovations to the airport, which is expected to be operational by 2015 with the ability to receive an anticipated 400,000 passengers a year in 2017.

==Tourist attractions==
Pisco is a Quechua word meaning &quot;bird&quot;. The area is often visited because of the concentration of marine animals and birds at the Paracas National Reserve, or the &quot;Peruvian Galápagos&quot;. At the reserve there are the Islas Ballestas, a collection of islands which are off limits to people, but boat tours can get close to. The Chincha Islands are also near its coast. Many bird species can be seen in the islands including pelicans, penguins, cormorants, Peruvian boobies, and Inca terns, as well as sea lions, turtles, dolphins, and whales.

Another attraction in the area is El Candelabro, a giant lamp dug in the rough sand in the method used by the creators of the Nazca Lines.

One of the major ancient civilizations in Peru, the Paracas culture, flourished in the area where Pisco sits. Due to its ease of access and its crossroads to the Andes, the Spaniards may have considered making Pisco the capital, before they decided on Lima.

In the city is the Plaza de Armas, where people buy tejas, small sweets made from pecans and assorted dried fruits. Many different building that surround the Plaza are the statue of José de San Martín, the mansion he lived in, and the Municipal Palace. Other building in the city is the heavily baroque Iglesia de la Compañía, begun in 1689, features a superb carved pulpit and gold-leaf altarpiece.

Near the town, just off the road to Ayacucho, lies the large, well-preserved Inca site of Tambo Colorado.

<text>The .38 Super, also known as .38 Super Auto, .38 Super Automatic, .38 Super Automatic +P (High Pressure Variant), .38 Super +P (High Pressure Variant), or 9×23mmSR, is a pistol cartridge that fires a bullet. It was introduced in the late 1920s as a higher pressure loading of the .38 ACP, also known as .38 Auto. The older .38 ACP cartridge propels a bullet at , whereas the .38 Super pushes the same bullet at . The .38 Super has gained distinction as the caliber of choice for many top practical shooting competitors; it remains one of the dominant calibers in IPSC competition.

==Design==
The .38 Super originated with the Colt M1900 pistol chambered for the .38 ACP cartridge. In the late 1920s, Colt improved both the gun and the cartridge to go with it. The .38 Super was capable of penetrating automobile bodies of the late 1920s, but it was deemed as lacking stopping power due the initial lack of hollow point factory loads. When jacketed hollow point (JHP) rounds were introduced nearly 40 years after the .38 Super introduction, +P+ 9mm ammo that equaled or surpassed the Super ballistics were already available in the market.

The .38 Super retains the original dimensions of the .38 ACP case. The cartridge was originally designed to headspace on the semi-rimmed case, which worked in the Colt M1900 due to the design of the feed ramp. When the .38 Auto became the .38 Super in the 1911A1, the feed ramp could no longer be used as rim support. As a result, the observed accuracy of the .38 Super suffered until Irv Stone of Bar-Sto barrels re-designed the chamber to allow headspacing on the case mouth. Since then, all new production .38 Super pistols headspace on the case mouth, as with other cartridges in this class. The semi-rimmed case is known to cause feeding problems in some magazines, especially double stack magazines, and led to the development of new variants with reduced rims (typically only .003 inch per side).

In 1974, the industry added the +P headstamp to the .38 Super to further distinguish it from the lower-pressure .38 ACP. Most current ammunition manufacturers label ammunition for the Super as .38 Super Automatic +P.

Because the .38 Super is dimensionally the same as the .38 ACP, it will chamber in pistols chambered for the .38 automatic, but it should not be used in them, since they weren&#x27;t designed to handle higher pressures.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .38 Super has 17.6 grains H2O (1.14 ml) cartridge case capacity.

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 1 in 16 in (406 mm), 6 grooves, ø lands = .346 in, ø grooves = .355 in, land width =.12 mm and the primer type is small pistol. Both the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI) and (C.I.P.) specify a bullet diameter of 0.356 inches (9.04 mm).

According to the official C.I.P. guidelines, the .38 Super case can handle up to 230 MPa (33,359 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every pistol cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to be certified for sale to consumers.

The SAAMI pressure limit for the .38 ACP or .38 Auto is set at 26,500 psi (182.72 MPa), piezo pressure. The SAAMI pressure limit for the .38 Super +P is set at 36,500 psi (251.66 MPa), piezo pressure.

The C.I.P. and SAAMI specified .38 Super (+P) has a semi-rimmed cartridge case.

===Rimless .38 Super cartridge case variants===

In recent years, cases such as the .38 Super Comp, .38 Super Lapua, .38 Super RL (Armscor), and .38 TJ (.38 Todd Jarrett) became available transforming the .38 Super into an almost truly rimless cartridge. These &quot;rimless&quot; cases are somewhat of a misnomer, due to the case rim not retaining the same diameter as the case wall just forward of the extractor groove. A common example is the .38 Super Comp case, which has a semi-rim extending only .003–.004 inch per side, compared to the standard .38 Super which has .007–.009 inch per side. The main reason for the development of new cases was due to the semi-rimmed .38 Super case not always feeding reliably from the double-stack box magazines used in several semi-automatic pistols popular with practical shooting sports, such as United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) or International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC). The nearly rimless cases improve feeding reliability in these pistols but are intended to be used in firearms that headspace on the case mouth. Other improvements found in some of these cases are modified extractor grooves and increased thickness in key parts of the brass for high pressure loadings.

==Performance==
Because of its larger case volume, which allows for more smokeless powder and results in higher muzzle velocities at similar pressure levels, the .38 Super offers higher bullet velocity potential than the 9×19mm Parabellum when handloaded and in some defense loadings. The 9×19mm Parabellum is however approved for higher pressure +P loadings by both SAAMI and C.I.P., which compensates for much of the case volume difference in factory-loaded ammunition. The .38 Super is generally regarded as a well-balanced cartridge with a flat trajectory, good accuracy and relatively high muzzle energy; most loadings have greater muzzle energy than many factory-loaded .45 ACP loadings.

===Muzzle velocity===
* 115 Gr (7.5 g) full metal jacket: 
* 124 Gr (8.0 g) full metal jacket: 

Cor-Bon/Glaser offers the .38 Super +P in several full-power self-defense–style loads with advertised velocities such as 115 gr and 125 gr . Tests with ammunition besides Cor-Bon/Glaser increases velocity by between to on average.

==Usage==

The .38 Super has made a comeback in IPSC and USPSA sports shooting raceguns, particularly when equipped with a compensator, because it exceeds the power factor threshold to be considered a &quot;major&quot; charge, while having much more manageable recoil than .45 ACP. Part of the felt recoil reduction is due to the use of lighter-weight bullets. The main cause of reduced felt recoil is a compensator, or muzzle brake.

The comeback began in the early 1980s when Rob Leatham and Brian Enos began experimenting and competing with .38 Super pistols in IPSC. At the time, single-stack 1911s in .45 ACP were dominant. Their .38 Super pistols held one or two more rounds simply due to the smaller case diameter. However, the biggest advantage was the muzzle brake, allowing for faster follow-up shots, and thus faster stages and subsequent higher scores. Competitors still using .45 ACP pistols attempted to keep pace, both by adding compensators and by reducing bullet weight, quickly reaching the limit at 152-155 grains. The .38 Super could be loaded with a bullet as light as 115 grains.

Use of compensators in competition is limited to the Open Division in IPSC and USPSA, as well as in certain cases for the International Defensive Pistol Association Enhanced Service Pistol division. The other divisions do not permit their use, such as the (IDPA) Stock Service Pistol division. Lacking a compensator, a .38 Super, running at major, has felt recoil much like that of a .45 ACP, and more than that of a 9mm Parabellum.

Apart from its popularity in shooting sports, the .38 Super +P is one of the most popular pistol cartridges in Latin America due to local restrictions on civilian ownership of firearms chambered for military cartridges, such as 9mm Parabellum and .45 ACP. While the .38 Super is popular in the Western hemisphere in general, it&#x27;s less commonly found in Europe.

The .38 Super round received further publicity through the single-action &quot;Colt Combat Commander&quot; and lightweight aluminum alloy frame &quot;Colt Commander&quot;. When Colt switched the inventory supply of the model from the Series-70s to the Series-80s, the model fell into lesser demand. A small number of .45 ACP submachine guns were also made in .38 Super, such as the Ingram Model 6 and Thompson submachine gun. A machine pistol variant of the M1911 chambered in .38 Super was also produced by Hyman S. Lehman.

The .38 Super +P cartridge ballistics have been improved over the years by the use of modern propellants. Since the early 2000s, ammunition is available with velocities exceeding . This is impressive from a semi-automatic pistol and is comparable to the .357 SIG. Ammunition is also being manufactured in the modern hollowpoint style bullet with excellent ballistics for personal defense. A standard single-stack magazine in a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol holds nine to eleven rounds, plus one in the chamber. Double-stack magazine pistols in this cartridge holds fifteen to eighteen rounds, plus one in the chamber.

<text>Plaza de armas (pl. ; literally &quot;arms square&quot; or &quot;place-of-arms&quot;) is a Spanish term commonly used to refer to town squares in Latin America, Spain and the Philippines, as well as a name commonly given to them; some examples also being found in North America. In the central region of Mexico this space is known as the Zócalo and in Central America as the Parque Central (central park). While some large cities have both a plaza de armas and a plaza mayor, in most cities those are two names for the same place.

Most cities constructed by the Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; were designed in a standard military fashion, based on a grid pattern taken from the Roman &quot;castrum&quot;, of which one block would be left vacant to form the Plaza de Armas. It is often surrounded by governmental buildings, churches, and other structures of cultural or political significance. The name derives from the fact that this would be a refuge in case of an attack upon the city, from which arms would be supplied to the defenders.

<text>The First Battle of Changsha (17 September 1939 – 6 October 1939; ) was the first of four attempts by Japan to take the city of Changsha, Hunan, during the second Sino-Japanese War. Coming two weeks after Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland on September 1, it was the first major battle of the war to fall within the time frame of what is widely considered World War II.

== Background and strategy ==
The war had reached a stalemate after two years of fighting. Professor Fu Sinian noted in July 1939 that while the Chinese army had become stronger, the Japanese army had weakened.

On 15 August, the 11th Army came up with the general plans for a campaign south of the Yangtze, ranging from the Xiang River (Xiangjiang) to the Gan River. In early September, Japanese General Toshizō Nishio of the &quot;Japanese Expeditionary Forces to China&quot; and Lieutenant-General Seishirō Itagaki set out to capture Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan. The Japanese 101st and 106th Divisions were deployed on the western bank of the Gan River in northern Jiangxi, and the 6th, 3rd, 13th, and 33rd Divisions marched southward from southern Hubei to northern Hunan.

Two of the primary motivating factors for the Japanese in launching the attack were the signing of a non-aggression pact by their German ally with their Soviet enemy, and their defeat by Soviet forces at Nomonhan. A large attack on the Chinese would therefore restore morale. In addition, Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland starting on 1 September 1939 gave the Japanese further motivation to crush China&#x27;s will to fight in order to pave the way for the establishment of Wang Jingwei&#x27;s puppet government in Central China.

Altogether, it became obvious that the 100,000 strong Japanese force was to converge on Changsha. The Chinese strategy was to counter the enemy column in northern Jiangxi and then encircle the line on the path southward.

== Order of battle for Battle of Changsha (1939) ==
== Battle ==
On the night of 14 September 1939, Lieutenant General Ryotaro Nakai&#x27;s 106th Division drove westward from north of Fengxin, Jiangxi, against Wan Baobang&#x27;s 184th Division of the Chinese 60th Corps. After fierce fighting, the defending forces abandoned Gao&#x27;an. The bulk of Japanese forces then moved northwest to assault Shangfu (), Ganfang (), and Xiushui (). In coordination with Nakai, Lieutenant General Jutaro Amakasu&#x27;s 33rd Division assaulted Guan Linzheng&#x27;s 15th Army Group from the south.

Having recently captured important strategic locations in Jiangxi Province, Japanese troops began their attacks on Changsha in earnest on 17 September. The Japanese 101st Division (Lieutenant General Masatoshi Saito) and 106th Division started marching westward towards Changsha in neighboring Hunan Province. Meanwhile, the 3rd Division (Lieutenant General Shinichi Fujita), 6th Division (Lieutenant General Shiro Inaba), 13th Division (General Shizuichi Tanaka), and 33rd Division invaded northern Hunan Province to put additional pressure on Changsha. However, the Japanese stretched too far out westward and were counter-attacked by Chinese forces from the south and the north, forcing them to retreat eastward.

On 19 September, Japanese forces proceeded to attack Chinese defensive positions along the Xinqiang River with poison gas on a wide scale. Japan had not signed the Geneva Protocol (1925).

After having recovered Cunqianjie on 19 September, Wang Yaowu&#x27;s 74th Corps (51D, 57D, &amp; 58D) and Song Ketang&#x27;s 32nd Corps (139D &amp; 141D) retook Gao&#x27;an in a counterattack on 22 September.

On 23 September Japanese forces drove the Chinese out of the Xinqiang river area, and the 6th and 13th Divisions crossed the river under a cover of heavy artillery, advancing further south along the Miluo River. East of Changsha, naval vessels landed the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Forces and portions of the 3rd Division, surrounding Changsha on three sides.

Heavy fighting continued afterwards and the Chinese retreated southward as distraction for the Japanese while supporting battalions arrived on the east and the west for an encirclement maneuver.

The Chinese defenders had decided beforehand on flexible, guerilla-style tactics to wear down Japanese manpower and supplies through ambushes and harassing maneuvers. Per General Chen Cheng&#x27;s orders, the objective was to “to lure the enemy into the vicinity of Changsha for a decisive battle.&quot; 

To deny the Japanese any supplies, the Chinese implemented scorched earth policies and evacuated local civilians into the hills. 

By 29 September, vanguard troops of the Japanese 6th Division had reached the outskirts of Changsha. However, a night attack the next day resulted in the Japanese advance finding themselves surrounded by “60,000 screaming Chinese on their front, rear and both flanks,” as an American military observer reported.

Due to the heavy casualties they had incurred, estimated in the tens of thousands with a significant portion being fatalities, as well as the dangerous possibility of their overstretched supply lines being completely severed by encirclement, the Japanese forces were forced to withdraw across the Laodao River. Acting group army commander Guan Linzheng issued orders at once for 52nd and 73rd Corps to pursue the Japanese to Miluo River. General Xue Yue ordered a general counterattack on 3 October in pursuit of the Japanese who were south of Chongyang and Yueyang. The Chinese, having brought up artillery pieces to the front, bombarded the retreating Japanese columns. 

On 5 October, Chinese troops shot down a Japanese aircraft with orders from General Yasuji Okamura to call off the Changsha offensive, and the nearby Chinese 23rd Division attacked a Japanese Navy port at Yingtian (now Miluo), damaging several vessels. By 6 October, Japanese forces at Changsha were decimated and retreating. Two days later, the remnants fled northward over the Miluo River while the Chinese 195th Division of the 52nd Corps pursued them across the Xinqiang River to recapture their former forward positions. At night, the Chinese launched raids into Xitang and Yaolin.

By 10 October, Chinese forces had completely regained their former territories in northern Hunan Province, southern Hubei Province and northern Jiangxi Province.

== Casualties ==
The Japanese claimed that their attack on Changsha had only been a spoiling attack, never meant to occupy Changsha permanently. They claimed to have lost only 850 killed and 2,700 wounded, whilst also claiming to have killed 44,000 Chinese soldiers and captured 4,000. 

Foreign military observers estimated Chinese losses at much lower at some 20,000 killed and wounded, whilst also claiming Japanese casualties of around 30,000. Military historian Michael Clodfelter estimates a total of around 50,000 Japanese casualties sustained in the fighting.

== Conclusion ==
Changsha was the first major city to successfully repel Japanese advances. Retaining the city allowed the Nationalist Chinese forces to prevent the Japanese from consolidating their territories in Southern China. The commander of the city&#x27;s defense, General Xue Yue, was a graduate of the Republic of China Military Academy and a Chiang Kai-shek loyalist.

<text>The National Police (, ), formerly known as the , is one of two national police forces of France, the other being the National Gendarmerie. The National Police is the country&#x27;s main civil law enforcement agency, with primary jurisdiction in cities and large towns. By contrast, the National Gendarmerie has primary jurisdiction in smaller towns, as well as in rural and border areas. The National Police comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior and has about 145,200 employees (as of 2015). Young French citizens can fulfill their mandatory service () in the national police force.

The national police force was created on 14 August 1941, under the Vichy regime, by a decree signed by the head of government, Philippe Pétain. This decree implements the law of 23 April 1941, creating the Police nationale: the forces of the Sûreté nationale (with the former services of the Sûreté générale, which became the Sûreté nationale in 1934, and the municipal police units, which became &quot;étatisées&quot; for the police forces of towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants) and the police services of the Préfecture de police in Paris are thus united. It was dissolved after the Liberation, by order of the Provisional Government of the French Republic on 16 November 1944. It was revived by Law no. 66-492 of 9 July 1966, on the organization of the police in France. This law unified the Sûreté Nationale and the Préfecture de Police.

The National Police operates mostly in cities and large towns. In that context, it conducts security operations such as patrols, traffic control and identity checks. Under the orders and supervision of investigating magistrates of the judiciary, it conducts criminal inquiries and serves search warrants. It also maintains specific services (&#x27;judicial police&#x27;) for these inquiries.

== Organization ==
The National Police is commanded by the Director-General (), who is currently Louis Laugier. The Director-General is personally in command of the General Directorate of the National Police () (DGPN) and responsible to the Minister of the Interior.

The , currently Laurent Nuñez, manages the that includes all police and security services in Paris, the three neighbouring departments of the region (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), and the airports of Roissy, Orly and Le Bourget. The Paris Police Prefecture is a separate law enforcement jurisdiction. While its officers belong to the National Police, their chief (the Police Prefect) acts completely independently from the Director-General of the National Police, reporting directly to the French Minister of the Interior. The elevated status of the Paris Police Prefect is also underlined by the fact that he/she is also head of the Île-de-France Defence and Security Zone (). The police forces in the other departments of the Île-de-France region are under the direct command of a (Department Prefect), being himself under the supervision of the as far as the active on-the-field police work is concerned, and under the control of the Director-General for the rest.

The National Police is sub-divided into (central) directorates, which are further composed of sub-directorates:
* (Directorate of Resources and Competences of the National Police; DRCPN): formed from the fusion of the former (Directorate of Training of the National Police; DFPN) and (Directorate of Administration of the National Police; DAPN). It was established on 1 September 2010 and employs approximately 3 000 people.
* (Central Directorate of the Judicial Police; DCPJ): charged with all criminal investigations under direction of magistrates. This mission is fulfilled in the Paris area by the which is nicknamed after its address &quot;&quot; (often without the number), and is a metonym for the Police generally; the national headquarters of the &quot;PJ&quot;, as it is usually called in French, are actually located at 11 rue des Saussaies, within the Ministry of the Interior). The main Sub-Directorates of the Judicial Police are: 
** &quot;SDAT&quot; (Anti-Terrorism Sub-Directorate): elite counter-terrorist task-force.
** &quot;SDLCODP&quot; (Sub-Directorate for the struggle against organised crime and financial delinquency): Includes all the National Investigation Offices specialising in Organised and Financial Crime, except for the National Itinerant Criminality Struggle Office (which falls under the )
** &quot;SDPTS&quot; (Sub-directorate of forensics and crime scene investigation)
** &quot;SDLC&quot; (Sub-directorate for the struggle against computer and internet crime)
* (Central Directorate of Public Security; DCSP): Patrol and response duties, misdemeanour investigations, emergency help; this Directorate comprises approximatively 80% of the workforce. The DCSP is the National Police&#x27;s equivalent of the Departmental Gendarmerie.
**Central apparatus ()
**92 départemental directorates in metropolitan France (sing. (&quot;DDSP&quot;), followed by the département&#x27;s number. For example the DDSP 62 is the Departement Public Security Directorate of Pas-de-Calais).
**The three départements of the region (Seine-Saint-Denis, Hauts-de-Seine and Val-de-Marne) were absorbed into the Paris Police Prefecture by Presidential Decree No. 2009-898 of 24 July 2009 and fused into the Proximity Security Directorate of the Parisian Agglomeration ( (&quot;DSPAP&quot;)), which includes four Proximity Security Territorial Directorates (sing. (&quot;DTSP&quot;)): DTSP 75 for the city of Paris; DTSP 92 in Nanterre for Hauts-de-Seine; DTSP 93 in Bobigny for Seine-Saint-Denis and DTSP 94 in Créteil for Val-de-Marne.
**7 overseas directorates: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, La Réunion, New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Mayotte.
* (Central Directorate of Border Police; DCPAF): performs identity checks with &quot;La douane française&quot; (official name: Direction générale des Douanes et Droits Indirects) and handles illegal immigration.
* (General Inspectorate of the National Police, IGPN): headed by the Inspector General and responsible for internal affairs. In the Paris Area, these tasks are assigned to a dedicated service—the (General Inspectorate of the Services).
* (Central Directorate of the Republican Security Companies; DCCRS): riot police, motorway police, and mountain rescue; commonly referred to as the CRS.
* (Technical International Police Co-operation Service; SCTIP).
* (Important Persons Protection Service; SPHP): VIP protection for people such as foreign diplomats and also responsible for the protection of the President of the French Republic through the .
* (Research, Assistance, Intervention, Deterrence; RAID) intervention unit. The elite counter-terror unit of the National Police and counterpart to the GIGN of the National Gendarmerie. The commander of RAID also doubles as the chief of the National Police Intervention Force (French abbreviation &quot;FIPN&quot;). The RAID is headquartered in Bièvres, Essonne, approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of Paris. As it is on stand-by for deployment nationwide, the primary intervention unit for reaction in Paris is the (&quot;BRI-BAC&quot;) - the Research and Intervention Brigade of the Paris Police Prefecture&#x27;s Judicial Police Regional Directorate. The function of the FIPN is that of a co-ordinating organ between the RAID and the BRI-BAC. The RAID used to operate closely with the UCLAT (, Counterterror Coordination Unit). On 27 December 2019 the UCLAT was absorbed into the &#x27;, the French domestic intelligence and security agency and the latter took over the close co-operation with the RAID.
**Territorial Detachments. The Central Directorate of Public Security - the National Police&#x27;s public order uniformed branch had its own tactical intervention units, the (Intervention Groups of the National Police (&quot;GIPN&quot;)).Between 2016 and 2019 these units were absorbed into the RAID as its territorial detachments ()
***10 territorial detachments in metropolitan France: Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Rennes, Strasbourg, Montpellier, Nancy and Toulouse;
***3 territorial detachments in the French overseas territories: Nouméa in New Caledonia, Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe and Saint-Denis in Réunion.

=== Former directorates ===
As of 1 July 2008, the following two National Police directorates:
* (Directorate of Territorial Surveillance; DST) – counter-intelligence, counterespionage, counterterrorism
* (Central Directorate of General Information; DCRG or RG) – police intelligence, records, research, analysis (and also policing gambling and horse racing, two activities which are now in the hands of the &quot;Service central des courses et jeux&quot; SCCJ, a unit of the Judicial Police)
were merged into one single domestic intelligence agency titled the (DCRI). The DCRI was placed directly under the Ministry of the Interior.

== Ranks ==

The National Police is divided into three &quot;corps&quot;, in the terminology of the French Civil Service, in ascending order of seniority:
* The (Management and Enforcement Corps) corresponds approximately to the enlisted and non-commissioned ranks in a military force, or to constables and sergeants in a British-style civil police force.
* The (Command Corps) corresponds approximately to the lower commissioned ranks of a military force, or the grades of inspector and chief inspector in a British-style civil police force. These ranks were previously known as if detectives or if uniformed, although CRS officers always used the current ranks.
* The (Conception and Direction Corps) corresponds approximately to the higher commissioned ranks of a military force, or to grades of Superintendent and chief officers in a British-style civil police force.
All the ranks insignia may be worn either on the shoulders or on the chest. In the latter they are square-shaped.

Prior to 1995 two civilian corps (&quot; and &quot;) existed in which plainclothes officers were given the training and authority to conduct investigations. The closest American equivalent is the detective branch.

== Equipment ==

=== Weapons ===

Prior to the Second World War and the formation of the Police Nationale, the French police used a variety of side arms, both revolvers and semi-automatic pistols, notably comprising the MAS 1873, the MAS 1892, the FN M1900, Ruby pistols, and a variety of privately purchased weapons.

Immediately after the Second World War, a variety of military side arms were issued, often captured weapons provided by the Army or French-produced German-designed weapons, such as the Mauser HSc or the Walther P38 for sidearms, and the Karabiner 98k rifle, to the now unified national force.

In 1951, a standardisation was performed on the RR 51 pistol in 7.65×17mm and on the MAS-38 and MAT-49 for submachine guns. From 1953, in the context of heightening violence of the Algeria War, CRS units were upgraded to the 9×19mm MAC Mle 1950.

In the early 1960s, large-caliber revolvers were introduced, culminating with the introduction of the Manurhin MR 73 and the Ruger SP101. In the 80s, a process to standardize revolvers was initiated. The 1970s also saw the introduction of automatic rifles and carbines (such as the SIG SG 543) to fend off heavily armed organised crime and terrorism.

In the 2000s, the police started switching to semi-automatic pistols and to the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. For some years, the standard sidearm in the National Police and the Gendarmerie Nationale was the PAMAS G1, which was French licensed and made. In 2003 both agencies made the biggest small arms contract since the Second World War for about 250,000 SIG Sauer Pro SP 2022s, a custom-tailored variant of the SIG Pro, replacing the PAMAS-G1 and several other pistols in service. The weapons are planned to stay in service until the year 2022, hence the weapon name. The police purchased more pistols in late 2018 possibly indicating they intend them to be used beyond 2022.

For greater threats the police use slightly modified Ruger Mini-14s purchased in the 1970s. More modern long guns like Remington 870, HK UMP and HK G36 are also issued.

Some sources have claimed the use of the Spectre M4 by the French National Police.

=== Cars ===
While the vast majority of vehicles are screen printed French brands (mainly Renault, Citroën and Peugeot), some service vehicles are provided by Ford and Opel. Plainclothes officers or specialised branches use vehicles from a variety of manufacturers.

<doc id="614024" wikidata="Q709303" url="?curid=614024" title="Battle of Changsha (1941–1942)">
<text>The Third Battle of Changsha (24 December 1941 – 15 January 1942; ) was the first major offensive in China by Imperial Japanese forces following the Japanese attack on the Western Allies and the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Japan&#x27;s third of four attempts to capture the Chinese city of Changsha. It was conducted with the purpose of severing Chinese lines of communication with British Hong Kong, and seizing control of Changsha&#x27;s food production. 

The offensive resulted in failure for the Japanese, as Chinese forces were able to lure them into a trap and encircle them. After suffering heavy casualties, Japanese forces were forced to carry out a general retreat.



== Background and forces ==
The city of Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was a point of major importance to the Chinese war effort. It was the key to China&#x27;s most important rice-producing provinces, areas which supplied food for populous areas around the wartime capital of Chongqing. Both sides recognized the importance of this city, and had fought two major battles over the city in the previous two years. 

The offensive was originally intended to prevent Chinese forces from reinforcing the British Commonwealth forces engaged in Hong Kong. Infuriated by Chinese claims of having defeated him in his September-October 1941 Changsha Offensive, Japanese Eleventh Army commander General Korechika Anami originally intended to mount a thrust with his army to support the Twenty-Third Army&#x27;s attack on Hong Kong. Anami&#x27;s main force consisted of 27 infantry battalions, 10 artillery battalions, and one artillery battery. However, the attack was carried out after Hong Kong had fallen, defeating the point of the operation. In addition, the Japanese had prepared the operation as a swift attack by light forces, and thus only prepared a slender supply route. It was a logistical weakness the Chinese would soon exploit. 

Defending Changsha were Chinese forces under the command of southern General Xue Yue. Nicknamed the &quot;Tiger of Changsha,&quot; Yue and his men had managed to defend Changsha against two large attacks by Japanese forces in 1939 and 1941. In both instances, the Chinese had lured the Japanese deep into their territory, and upon engaging their forces in Changsha, severed their supply lines from the rear, forcing the Japanese back into retreats and inflicting heavy losses. 

== Attack ==

The Japanese commenced combat operations on 24 December 1941, with the 6th and 40th Divisions leading the way. Japanese forces initially cut through Chinese defenders. By 29 December 1941, believing that the city of Changsha was &quot;inadequately defended&quot;, Anami elected to capture it. He was supposed to drive from the south of Hankou, about east of the Hankou-Canton Railway, and reach the Miluo River, but disobeyed orders from Imperial General Headquarters and penetrated Chinese lines as far as toward Changsha. He committed the 3rd and 6th Divisions and his forces were surprised to be met with fierce opposition. 

Fighting was the most intense over southern and eastern gates of the city&#x27;s walls, and both sides waged vicious see-saw battles over points of tactical importance. One mound, nicknamed &quot;Graveyard Hill,&quot; changed hands 11 times in less than 72 hours.

The Japanese 3rd Division managed to penetrate into the southeastern side of the city, but could make no further advances. On 4 January 1942, the Eleventh Army had managed to occupy &quot;all the important points of the city,&quot; but they were in danger of encirclement by counterattacking Chinese.

The Chinese, in a near-repeat of the previous battles for Changsha, had penetrated to the rear of the main Japanese force and severed their supply lines. As a result, Japanese supplies in ammunition and rations, already strained by days of combat, plunged to dangerously low levels: soldiers in some regiments had only 10-15 bullets each, and some platoons only had a single grenade to share amongst themselves. Japanese prisoners later taken by the Chinese were reported to have not eaten for days prior to their capture, having prepared only 5 days worth of food.

== Japanese retreat ==
With the prospect of becoming encircled, and bled dry of men and material, the Eleventh Army ordered a withdrawal on 4 January 1942. 

The withdrawal was conducted under &quot;considerable hardship,&quot; according to a post-war Japanese account. “Not only did the Japanese forces have to fight off persistent assaults from large enemy forces… but they had also been compelled to escort a large number of casualties and rear service units.&quot; Only their near complete air superiority prevented the Japanese from being annihilated entirely.

The Chinese forces, some 20 divisions in 9 armies, pursued the Eleventh Army, killing large numbers of Japanese troops in the process. Some Japanese units — like the 200-man detachment from the 9th Independent Mixed Brigade, from which only one man survived — were almost completely destroyed.

== Aftermath ==
Changsha had been successfully defended by the Chinese Army for a third time. Against a backdrop of swift victories across the Pacific, Changsha was the only place where the Japanese Army was suffering defeat in early 1942.

Both sides had suffered heavy losses as a result of the fighting. Historian Richard B. Frank estimates the Japanese lost almost 57,000 troops in the battle, including some 33,941 killed and 23,003 wounded. The New York Times estimated the Japanese had lost some 52,000 men in the fighting around Changsha. The Nome Nugget reported the Japanese had lost 15,000 men on January 2 alone, including many high-ranking officers, mostly by artillery fire. The Chinese also suffered heavy casualties. The intensity of the fighting combined with the Chinese Army&#x27;s harsh discipline meant that Chinese soldiers often fought to the death at their positions, with one Chinese regiment being reduced to 58 survivors after only a few days of fighting.

Changsha would remain in Chinese hands until 1944, when Japanese forces would capture the city as part of the Ichi-Go offensive. By then however the tide has completely turned against Japan both in China and the Pacific and the city&#x27;s importance had diminished greatly. The city would be retaken by Chinese forces in 1945.

<text>The Battle of Changsha of 1944 (also known as the Battle of Hengyang or Campaign of Changsha-Hengyang; ) was an invasion of the Chinese province of Hunan by Japanese troops near the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. As such, it encompasses three separate conflicts: an invasion of the city of Changsha and two invasions of Hengyang.

The Japanese military transferred the bulk of their troops from the Japanese homeland and Manchuria as part of Operation &quot;Ichi-Go&quot; or &quot;Tairiku Datsu Sakusen&quot; which roughly translates as &#x27;Operation to Break through the Continent&#x27;. This was an attempt to establish a land and rail corridor from the Japanese occupied territories of Manchuria, Northern and Central China and Korea and those in South East Asia.

==Japanese objectives==

Changsha is the capital city of Hunan province and an important junction of two railroads in southern China: the tri-province railroad of Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi and the one from Canton to Wuhan. Hengyang is also on the tri-province railroad and very close to the Canton-Wuhan Railroad. Furthermore, Lake Dongting and the cities of Changsha, Hengyang, and Lingling, are connected by the Xiang River. It was imperative for both sides to control the suburban areas of Changsha and Hengyang.

The tactical objective of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army was to secure the railroad of Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi and the southern area of China. The United States 14th Air Force of United States Army Air Forces also stationed their fighters and bombers at several air bases along the three-province railroad: Hengyang, Lingling, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning. From there, the American Flying Tigers led by Brigadier General Claire Lee Chennault, had inflicted heavy damage on Japanese troops both in China and Formosa and could launch air strikes against the home islands of Japan.

After several ineffective air strikes by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, the Japanese decided to use ground forces to deny Allied air power these air bases. By a direct order from Shunroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, the Japanese 11th Army stationed at Wuhan was given the mission to attack Changsha and advance southwest via the tri-province railroad. It was later to join forces with the Japanese 23rd Army of the Japanese Sixth Area Army from Canton.

General Isamu Yokoyama (橫山勇), the two-star general of the Japanese 11th Army, headed five divisions reinforced by four more divisions and three independent brigades. Shunroku Hata decided to stay at Wuhan from 25 May 1944 until the end of the second phase of Operation Ichi-Go.

==Battle of Hengyang==

Two Japanese military detachments moved on to besiege Hengyang, but the NRA&#x27;s understrength Tenth Corps under the command of Fang Xianjue repelled their advance twice. The predicament in Hengyang helped hasten the crumbling of Hideki Tojo&#x27;s cabinet. In conjunction with the loss of Saipan on 9 July 1944, Tojo and his cabinet handed in their resignation on 18 July 1944.

In August 1944, Japanese troops led by three two-star generals again attacked Hengyang with air support. Chinese troops resisted fiercely aided by local knowledge and constructing effective barricades up to four meters high. The Chinese defenses were intelligently constructed and used crossfire zones to maximize firepower. This caused the Japanese 68th and 116th Divisions to lose morale and it began preparations for retreat. Morale rose, however, when the Japanese 58th Division broke into the northwest perimeter of the city, defended by the Chinese Third Division and the attack resumed. Reinforcements from five Corps: the 37th, 62nd, 74th, 79th, and 100th, attempted many times to reach Hengyang, but were blocked by four Japanese divisions: the 27th, 34th, 40th, and 64th.

The Japanese eventually captured the Chinese Tenth Corps commander Fang Xianjue, who surrendered Hengyang on 8 August 1944 after his Tenth Corps was decimated, down from seventeen thousand to three thousand men (including the wounded). This concluded the Campaign of Changsha-Hengyang.

===The defeated Tenth Corps===
The Chinese Military Affairs Commission reactivated the headquarters of the Tenth Corps at Yi-San in Guangxi after the defeat of Hengyang. Li Yu-tang was the commanding general of the parent unit of the Tenth Corps.

Some of the surviving Tenth Corps soldiers slipped through the Japanese lines and returned to the new corps headquarters on foot. Of the imprisoned three thousand wounded Chinese soldiers, one thousand died of starvation, injury, sickness or mistreatment by the Japanese.

Most of the captured Chinese general officers at Hengyang managed to break through the Japanese lines separately. On 19 September 1944, Fang Xianjue was rescued by a clandestine team from the Changsha Station of the &quot;Military-Statistics Bureau&quot; of the Military Affairs Commission and was personally received by Chiang Kai-shek at Chiang&#x27;s Chongqing residence on 14 December 1944. Against the unofficial military traditions in east Asia, &quot;Fang and his five tiger-like generals,&quot; who surrendered the Chinese Tenth Corps to the Japanese, were welcomed in Chongqing; they were also awarded the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. Fang and two other generals were given full command of new full-strength divisions. At the same time, Fang was also assigned to the two-star deputy commander of the 37th Army Group. All six general officers remained on active military duty until after the end of the war.

==Aftermath==

After 47 days of bitter fighting, Japanese troops managed to occupy Hengyang with a high price in casualties over the city of Hengyang - many people died, including 390 Japanese commissioned officers dead and another 520 wounded. The 68th and 116th Divisions lost their combat strength and were reassigned to garrison duties. Thus, the Chinese troops to the north were able to expand their influence despite the loss of Hengyang city.

On the side of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, Xue&#x27;s Ninth Military Front in this campaign lost two effective corps loyal to Chiang Kai-Shek: the 4th and the 10th corps. This rendered &quot;Tiger Xue&quot; a toothless tiger until the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Ninth Military Front reported its losses as 32,009 killed and 52,895 wounded. The statistics do not include the number of missing and the loss figures of some of the units are much lower than the unit&#x27;s own detailed battle report, with the 4th and 10th corps being the most apparent. The Ninth Military Front reported the losses of the 4th Corps as 1,070 killed and 2,200 wounded. The 4th corps reported its own losses in June as 3,860 killed, 4,198 wounded, and 8,473 missing. The Ninth Military Front reported the losses of the 10th corps as 1,465 killed and 3,289 wounded while most of the 17,000-strong 10th corps (plus attached units) were killed or missing in Hengyang. Overall, total casualties of the Ninth Military Front in the Changsha-Hengyang campaign should exceed 100,000.

Sequentially, the Japanese 11th Army moved toward Lingling, seizing it on 4 September 1944, and controlled Guilin on 10 November 1944. The Japanese China Expeditionary Army ostensibly had completed the strategic objective of the Imperial Japanese General Staff: linking up by occupation their territories in east Asia, (although they did not have enough manpower to maintain actual control over it due to their heavy losses).

Moreover, the United States Army Air Forces transferred all their bomber groups in the above Chinese air bases to newly captured Saipan in July 1944, during the battle of Hengyang. From Saipan, United States aerial fleets began their bombing campaign against the home islands of Japan. One of the Japanese tactical achievements in this bloody campaign, (Operation Ichi-Go), had been easily neutralized by a simple American military maneuver in the Pacific.

After the battle of Hengyang, the Japanese could not continue to fight effectively. During this period Japan discovered that government privileges from Wang Jingwei&#x27;s puppet regime were useless. Consequently, they rejected plans to take more Chinese territory. At the same time their negotiating position with China became significantly less powerful—to the point where they agreed to set aside the &quot;Tang Ju&quot; treaty.

The Chinese government continued to pressure the Japanese to completely withdraw from the northeast. The Japanese, in a desperate measure, collected as many troops as possible in April 1945 to invade a heavy settlement (Zhijiang) in the west of Hunan, hoping to open a path to Sichuan. The troops were intercepted and almost completely wiped out in an ambush by the Chinese National Guard. China regained some of its territory. At this point, the course of the war had turned. The Japanese subsequently surrendered at the Zijiang River.

<doc id="614030" wikidata="Q4562" url="?curid=614030" title="O-Zone">
<text>O-Zone is a Moldovan Eurodance group and boy band produced by Dan Bălan; originating in 1999 as a duo, which consisted of Bălan, and Petru Jelihovschi before the latter&#x27;s departure. Their official trio lineup in 1999 consisted of Bălan, Radu Sîrbu, and Arsenie Todiraș.

The group gained global popularity with their song &quot;Dragostea din Tei&quot; and their subsequent album &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot;, which was released in 2003, before disbanding the following year.

The group members have since focused on their solo careers. The band occasionally reunited for concerts in 2017 (Chișinău, Moldova; Bucharest, Romania) and 2019 (Bucharest, Romania). In 2024, it was announced that O-Zone are going to do a summer tour, but this time as a tribute band, consisting of Arsenie as only singer and two dancers. Worldwide, O-Zone have sold over 12 million copies of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; and over 2.5 million copies of its parent album &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot;.

==History==
===1998–2001: Formation and Early Years===
O-Zone first formed as a duo of Dan Bălan and Petru Jelihovschi in 1999. They released their first album, &quot;Dar, Unde Ești...&quot;, in 1999. However, Jelihovschi had not intended to make music his career, so he split from Bălan. Undaunted, Bălan held open auditions for new band members. At one such audition, he met Arsenie &quot;Arsenium&quot; Todiraș, who eventually won over the initially skeptical Bălan with his version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. Bălan and Todiraș would have proceeded as a duo act until Bălan received a call from Radu Sîrbu, who wanted a chance to audition for the group. Despite Sîrbu having missed the initial auditions, Bălan agreed, and after a successful audition, Sîrbu joined O-Zone, officially making the group a trio.

===2002–2004: Rise to success===

In 2002, O-Zone moved from Moldova to Bucharest, Romania, hoping to gain more recognition. There, the group became an instant hit band with their upbeat song &quot;Despre Tine&quot; (&quot;About You&quot;), which held the top position on the Romanian Top 100 chart for three weeks in February 2003. Their second hit, which brought them worldwide attention, was &quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot;, translated roughly as &quot;Love from the Linden Trees&quot;. It quickly became popular in Romania, where it also topped the Romanian singles chart for four weeks in September 2003, but faded from popularity by the end of 2003. However, the song gained popularity in Italy when the little-known duo Haiducii released a cover of &quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot;, which topped the Italian pop charts. Arsenie Todiraș later said that at the time that, while not illegal, Haiducii&#x27;s cover felt like a betrayal because the group had not asked permission to make a cover. However, the cover&#x27;s success led to curiosity about the original artist, and led to Time Records, an Italian record label, offering O-Zone a one-year contract. Soon after the song&#x27;s release in Italy, it was also released in various other countries in Europe under Polydor Records and became an instant hit.

&quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot; topped the singles charts of nearly a dozen European countries in 2004. It reached the top-10 in many other countries, including in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 3 on the singles chart. The re-release of &quot;Despre Tine&quot; in 2004 from the same album had similar success across Europe.

In contrast to their multi-platinum status in Europe, O-Zone never entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in the United States, although it did reach the 14th position on the Hot Dance Airplay chart. The viral video &quot;Numa Numa Dance&quot; by interneter Gary Brolsma helped to boost awareness of &quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot; in the U.S. In the video Brolsma was seen lip-syncing to the song while sitting in a chair and dancing with only his arms and hands, but, while the song received moderate to major airplay, most Americans knew it simply as the &quot;Numa Numa Song&quot; and never knew the name of the original song or the group that performed it. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was sampled in the song &quot;Live Your Life&quot; by T.I. and Rihanna, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in late 2008.

===2005: O-Zone split up===
On 13 January 2005, while still very popular, the members of O-Zone announced their disbandment, citing personal reasons. Their last European concert was held at the 2005 Golden Stag Festival in Romania.

Also in 2005, Japanese music label Avex Trax gained distribution rights for O-Zone music in Japan and released the album &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot; in August 2005 in the country. The album, which features the song &quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot;, became immensely successful in Japan. Topping the Oricon albums charts, it reached over 800,000 sales in 2005 alone and became the 12th-most popular album of 2005, partially because the album was re-released twice by Avex Trax. &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot; ended up charting for over a year on the Oricon weekly albums chart and sold over one million copies overall. In 2006, O-Zone won the Best Foreign Act award at the 2006 Japan Gold Disc Awards.

===2017–present: Occasional reunions and tribute band ===

On 5 May 2017, Dan Bălan, Radu Sîrbu and Arsenie Todiraş announced that O-Zone would be reforming for two concerts. O-Zone re-united for Europe Day on 9 May 2017. One of concerts was held in Chișinău and the other took place on the same day in Bucharest.

On 17 December 2019, Dan Bălan, Radu Sîrbu and Arsenie Todiraş announced that O-Zone would be performing for one concert, which took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2019 in Bucharest as part of performances by stars of the 90s and 00s called Revelion 2020 Disco Night Fever. After the event, all three returned to their projects again. The exception was the collaboration of Radu and Arsenie for the song &quot;Lay Down&quot;.

In 2024, O-Zone announced a summer tour in Europe, but this time as a tribute band, consisting of Arsenie from the original group and two dancers.

Its population was 484,475 as of 2017 and is the 7th most populous city in Peru. The city is located in the central eastern part of the Piura Region, 981 kilometers from the country&#x27;s capital, Lima and is near to the border with Ecuador.

It was here that Spanish Conqueror Francisco Pizarro founded the third Spanish city in South America and first in Peru, under the name of &quot;San Miguel de Piura&quot;, in July or August of 1532. Piura declared its independence from Spain on 4 January 1821, a few months before Peru gained its independence on 28 July 1821. It is the commercial and administrative center of the Department of Piura.

==History==

=== Pre-columbian era ===
Like most of northern Peru, the territory of Piura has been inhabited by their autochthonous group of natives called &quot;tallanes&quot; and &quot;yungas&quot;. These groups lived without an organization or single leader to rule until the Muchik culture eventually took control, and the mixture of these evolved into the Vicús culture. The Chimor, Moche and Wari Empire used to occupy the area surrounding the city. Centuries later, Piura came under the rule of Tupac Inca Yupanqui of the Inca Empire for at least 40 years before the Spanish arrived.

=== Colonial era ===
Francisco Pizarro came to the area and established it as the third Spanish city in South America, and Spain&#x27;s first city in Peru. He originally went all the way to what is now Tumbes but decided it was not a suitable base for his operations. With the arrival of the Spanish in 1532, the current mestizo and creole cultures of Piura were born. This mestizo culture includes influences from Spanish Extremadura and Andalucia; African influence, owing to the arrival of slaves from Madagascar (Malgache slaves); Chinese coolies who migrated from Canton to work the rice fields and replace the slaves; and also Roma Gypsies who came as pirates looking for pearls, or incognito as Spanish horsemen.

The Spanish named the city from the Quechuan word , meaning &#x27;abundance&#x27;. Nowadays, Piura is known as the , &#x27;the city of eternal heat&#x27;, because it is hot all year round.

=== Independence ===
In 1820, with the incursions of Admirals Guillermo Brown and Cochrane of the liberating expedition of José de San Martín, the Piuran population enthusiastically joined the liberating cause, and on January 4, 1821, the independence of Piura was proclaimed in the atrium of the temple of San Francisco. The proclamation was an feat led by the heroes José de Lama, Tomás Cortés, Baltazar Taboada, Tomás Diéguez, the Seminario brothers and others. Likewise, the Piura division of 1,000 men contributed victoriously to the independence of Quito, taking part in the Battle of Pichincha, on May 24, 1822.

=== Republican era ===
In 1861, the Department of Piura was created and Piura became the departments capital. The department consisted other three provinces at the time, Piura, Paita and Ayabaca.

In the 1860s, the city of Piura became more dynamic with the cultivation of Pima cotton, brought by Don Emilio Hilbck from the state of Arizona in the United States, which promoted the industrialization and development of the city and the region, and strong immigration. of English, German and Spanish, in that order, and to a lesser extent Italians and Chinese, who brought their customs and also their knowledge of commerce and industry. Many Americans also arrived. They quickly incorporated themselves into the social fabric, forming families with local ladies and inevitably creating new tastes and habits. Even Piura&#x27;s cuisine was enriched. In agriculture, the use of the steam pump and specialized machinery was introduced, allowing more cropland to be irrigated, expanding the network of canals since the success of Piuran cotton in the international market was a great stimulus for agriculture. New industries appeared such as deep-sea fishing by whaling fleets, mass production and export trade of toquilla straw hats from Catacaos and annexes.

Peruvian war hero of the War of the Pacific against Chile, Miguel Grau Seminario was born in Piura on July 27, 1834. He became a hero during the naval Battle of Angamos. According to historians and the Peruvian state, since 2011, they have given the official birthplace of Grau not to Piura but to the port of Paita. Miguel Grau is the most renowned and iconic Peruvian naval officer, being known as &quot;el Caballero de los Mares&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Gentleman of the Seas&quot;).

<text>Tel Megiddo (from ) is the site of the ancient city of Megiddo (; ), the remains of which form a tell or archaeological mound, situated in northern Israel at the western edge of the Jezreel Valley about southeast of Haifa near the depopulated Palestinian town of Lajjun and subsequently Kibbutz Megiddo. Megiddo is known for its historical, geographical, and theological importance, especially under its Greek name Armageddon. During the Bronze Age, Megiddo was an important Canaanite city-state. During the Iron Age, it was a royal city in the Kingdom of Israel.

Megiddo&#x27;s strategic location at the northern end of the defile of the Wadi Ara, which acts as a pass through the Carmel Ridge, and its position overlooking the rich Jezreel Valley from the west gave it much of its importance.

Excavations have unearthed 20 strata of ruins since the Neolithic phase, indicating a long settlement period. The site is protected as Megiddo National Park and is a World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
Megiddo was known in the Akkadian language used in Assyria as Magiddu, Magaddu. In Egyptian, it was Maketi, Makitu, and Makedo. In the Canaanite-influenced Akkadian used in the Amarna letters, it was known as Magidda and Makida. It was , &quot;Magedón/Mageddó&quot; in the Septuagint; in the Vulgate.

The Book of Revelation describes an apocalyptic battle at Armageddon in Revelation 16:16: , a transliteration of the Hebrew &quot;Har Megiddo&quot; &quot;Mount Megiddo&quot;. From this surreal appearance in a well-known eschatological text, the term &quot;Armageddon&quot; has come to signify any world-ending catastrophe.

==History==

Megiddo was important in the ancient world. It guarded the western branch of a narrow pass on the most important trade route of the ancient Fertile Crescent, linking Egypt with Mesopotamia and Anatolia and known today as Via Maris. Because of its strategic location, Megiddo was the site of several battles. It was inhabited approximately from 5000 to 350 BCE, or even, as Megiddo Expedition archaeologists suggest, since around 7000 BCE.

===Neolithic===
====Yarmukian Culture====
Archaeological Stratum XX in Tel Megiddo began around 5000 BCE during the Neolithic. The first Yarmukian culture remains were found at this level in 1930s excavations, but they were not recognized as such then. These remains, found in Area BB, were pottery, a figurine, and flint items.

===Chalcolithic===
====Wadi Rabah culture====
The Chalcolithic period came next, with significant content around 4500–3500 BCE, as part of the Wadi Rabah culture, at the following base level of Tel Megiddo, as other large tell sites in the region, was located near a spring.

===Early Bronze Age===
====Early Bronze I====
Megiddo&#x27;s Early Bronze Age I (3500–2950 BCE) was originally worked in 1933–1938 by the Oriental Institute, now the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. Decades later, a temple from the end of this period was found and dated to Early Bronze Age IB (ca. 3000 BCE) and described by its excavators, Adams, Finkelstein, and Ussishkin, as &quot;the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered&quot; in the early Bronze Age Levant and among the largest structures of its time in the Near East.

Samples, obtained by Israel Finkelstein&#x27;s Megiddo Expedition, at the temple-hall in the year 2000, provided calibrated dates from the 31st and 30th century BCE. The temple is the most monumental Early Bronze I structure known in the Levant, if not the entire Ancient Near East. Archaeologists&#x27; view is that &quot;taking into account the manpower and administrative work required for its construction, it provides the best manifestation for the first wave of urban life and, probably, city-state formation in the Levant&quot;.

To the South of this temple there is an unparalleled monumental compound. It was excavated by the Megiddo Expedition in 1996 and 1998, and belongs to the later phase of Early Bronze IB, ca. 3090–2950 BCE. It consists of several long, parallel stone walls, each of which is 4 meters wide. Between the walls were narrow corridors, filled hip-deep with the remains of animal sacrifice. These walls lie immediately below the huge ‘megaron’ temples of the Early Bronze III (2700–2300 BCE). The megaron temples remained in use through the Intermediate Bronze period.

Magnetometer research, before the 2006 excavations, found that the entire Tel Megiddo settlement covered an area of ca. 50 hectares, being the largest known Early Bronze Age I site in the Levant. In 2014, Pierre de Miroschedji stated that Tel Megiddo had around 25 hectares in the Early Bronze IA and IB periods, when most settlements in the region only covered a maximum area of 5 hectares, but that excavations suggest large sites like Tel Megiddo were &quot;sparsely built, with dwellings disorderly distributed and separated by open spaces.&quot;

====Early Bronze II-III====
Tel Megiddo was still among the large fortified sites, between 5 and 12 hectares, during the Early Bronze II-III period, when its palace testifies that it was a real city-state &quot;characterized by a strong social hierarchy, a hereditary centralized power, and the functioning of a palatial economy.&quot;

====Early Bronze IV====
The town declined in the Early Bronze Age IV period (2300–2000 BCE) as the Early Bronze Age political systems collapsed at the last quarter of the third millennium BCE.

===Middle Bronze Age===
====Middle Bronze I====
Early in the second millennium BCE, at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1950 BCE), urbanism once again took hold throughout of the southern Levant. Large urban centers served as political power in city-states.

====Middle Bronze II====
By the later Middle Bronze Age, the inland valleys were dominated by regional centers such as Megiddo, which reached a size of more than 20 hectares, including the upper and lower cities. A royal burial was found in Tel Megiddo, dating to the later phase of the Middle Bronze Age, around 1700–1600 BCE, when the power of Canaanite Megiddo was at its peak and before the ruling dynasty collapsed under the might of Thutmose&#x27;s army.

In mortuary contexts, in a dental calculus of individual MGD018 (c. 1630–1550 BCE), at Tel Megiddo, turmeric and soybean proteins were found, which are South Asian products, suggesting he may have been a merchant or trader who &quot;consumed foods seasoned with turmeric or prepared with soy oil in the Levant, in South Asia, or elsewhere,&quot; indicating the possible existence of an Indo-Mediterranean trade. Sesamum protein (sesame), another South Asian product, was found in individual MGD011 (c. 1688–1535 BCE).

===Late Bronze Age===

Late Bronze age, as per radiocarbon datings in areas H and K of Tel Megiddo, began in the first half of the 16th century BCE (c. 1585–1545 BCE).

====Late Bronze II – Egyptian Period====
At the Battle of Megiddo the city was subjugated by Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BCE), and became part of the Egyptian Empire. The city still prospered, and a massive and elaborate government palace was constructed in the Late Bronze Age. Thutmose III&#x27;s campaign is attested in Stratum IX at Tel Megiddo, a well fortified site in Late Bronze Age I.

In the Amarna Period (c. 1353–1336 BCE), Megiddo was a vassal of the Egyptian Empire. The Amarna Letter E245 mentions local ruler Biridiya of Megiddo. Other contemporary rulers mentioned were Labaya of Shechem and Surata of Akka, nearby cities. This ruler is mentioned in the corpus from the city of &#x27;Kumidu&#x27;, the Kamid al lawz. This indicates that there were relations between Megiddo and Kumidu.

Megiddo&#x27;s Stratum VIIB lasted until slightly before or in the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1184–1153 BCE).

===Iron Age===
====Iron Age I====
Iron Age I (c. 1150–950 BCE) began in Tel Megiddo around 1150 BCE. Egypt&#x27;s control of this Canaanite region ended around 1130 BCE, as Stratum VIIA was destroyed around this date or shortly thereafter, attested in the palace and adjacent Level H-11 building. A Canaanite dynasty still controlled the city after the Egyptians abandoned the region. The beginning of Philistine Bichrome pottery at Megiddo was after 1124 BCE, or in the period (c. 1128–1079 BCE), based on radiocarbon datings with a confidence of 95.4%.

Stratum VIB (Iron IA; Early Iron I) can be aligned with the late 20th Dynasty of Egypt. The Transitional Iron IA/IB may reflect the end of the Egyptian Empire in the Southern Levant.

Stratum VIA (Iron IB; Late Iron I) correspond with the 21st Dynasty in Egypt and ends with destruction at the transitional Iron I/II.

====Iron Age I/II transition====
The Iron I/II transition saw a fierce conflagration that consumed Stratum VIA. The transition saw the end of the old culture which had lingered since the Late Bronze and the beginning of a new culture forming the Northern Kingdom. Scholars debate the exact timing of this transition.

The city represented by Stratum VI is considered completely Canaanite by Israel Finkelstein. It is thought to have a mixed Canaanite and Philistine character by archaeologists Yigael Yadin and Amihai Mazar (2005). It fell victim to fire, when the earliest fragmentary Gate 3165 from Stratum VIA in the Late Iron Age I (c. 1050–950 BCE) was destroyed along with the whole city at the end of this period, marking the end of Iron I in the Jezreel Valley and of Canaanite culture there. This destruction was &quot;caused by the growing proto-Israelite power in the central hill country, out of which [emerged] the Northern Kingdom of Israel [that] should be dated to the first half of the 10th century BCE,&quot; related to &quot;the biblical narrative of the war led by Deborah and Barak in Judges 4–5.&quot;

Ben-Dor Evian and Finkelstein (2023), based on an updated Bayesian model and recent radiocarbon datings, proposed that Stratum VIA ended sometime between 999 and 974 BCE, not due to the conquest of Shoshenq I but by &quot;the expansion of the highlanders into the valley, a development that soon brought about the emergence of the Israelite Northern Kingdom.&quot; Applying Bayesian model inference (OxCal v.4.4 software), archaeologist Enrique Gil Orduña (2024) considers this destruction took place sometime around 986 to 983 BCE.

====Iron Age II====
There have been several contradictory proposals for the political history of the Early Iron Age excavation layers. The destruction of Stratum V was attributed, by Yadin and Mazar, to Shoshenq I, the first pharaoh of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt, who would have taken Megiddo sometime around 926 BCE, which is attested in a cartouche on a stele fragment, found in a spoil heap of the Shumacher excavation by the Oriental Institute team, and in a partial and damaged list of toponyms at the Temple of Karnak. However, recalibration of radiocarbon datings, using calibration curve (IntCal20), supports Finkelstein&#x27;s view that the destruction of Stratum V was due to Hazael&#x27;s campaign, c. 835 BCE (9th century BCE).
Rulers of the Israelite Northern Kingdom improved the fortress from around 900 to 750 BCE. The palaces, water systems and fortifications of the site at this period were among the most elaborate Iron Age constructions found in the Levant. There is a putative &quot;Solomonic gate&quot; (Gate 2156), which belongs to Stratum VA-IVB, dated by recent excavations and new radiocarbon analysis by Megiddo Expedition, led by Israel Finkelstein, during the time of the Omrides, (c. 886–835 BCE), in the Late Iron Age IIA (around 900–780 BCE).

Hendrik J. Bruins recalibrated Israel Finkelstein&#x27;s radiocarbon available samples, using the latest 2020 calibration curve (IntCal20), and concluded that the initial establishment of Stratum VB belongs to the 10th century BC, during the time of the possible United Monarchy, based on two radiocarbon samples. These two samples are RTT-5498 and RTK-6755, dated to 961 cal BC (median) and 928 cal BCE (median) respectively. Four other samples from Stratum VA-IVB, which are RTK-6408, 6760, 6429, and RTT-3948, belong to the period of the Omrides, dated to 865, 858, 858, and 857 cal BCE (median) respectively.

Tel Megiddo became an important city, before being destroyed, possibly by Aramaean raiders. The Aramean occupation was around 845–815 BCE. Jeroboam II (c. 789–748 BCE) reigned over Megiddo.

====Assyrian Period====

Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria conquered Megiddo in 732 BCE, turning it to the capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire&#x27;s province of Magiddu. Hoshea (c. 732–721 BCE), the last king of the Israelite Northern Kingdom, was vassal to Tiglath-Pileser III. The site was rebuilt as an administrative center for Tiglath-Pileser III&#x27;s occupation of Samaria.

====Egyptian Period====
In 609 BCE, Megiddo was conquered by Egyptians under Necho II, during the Battle of Megiddo.

====Babylonian Period====
Its importance soon dwindled, and it was thought as finally abandoned around 586 BCE. Since that time it would have remained uninhabited, preserving ruins pre-dating 586 BCE without settlements ever disturbing them. Archaeologist Eric Cline considers that Tel Megiddo came to an end later, around 350 BCE, during Achaemenid times. Then, the town of al-Lajjun, not to be confused with the al-Lajjun archaeological site in Jordan, was built up near to the site, but without inhabiting or disturbing its remains.

===Roman Age===
====Megiddo church====

The Megiddo church is next to Megiddo Junction, inside the precinct of the Megiddo Prison. It was built within the ancient city of Legio. It is believed to date to the 3rd century, making it one of the oldest churches in the world. It was a few hundred yards from the Roman base camp of Legio VI Ferrata. A centurion donated one of the mosaics found in the church.

===Modern Israel===
Megiddo is south of Kibbutz Megiddo by . Today, Megiddo Junction is on the main road connecting the center of Israel with lower Galilee and the north. It lies at the northern entrance to Wadi Ara, an important mountain pass connecting the Jezreel Valley within Israel&#x27;s coastal plain.

In 1964, during Pope Paul VI&#x27;s visit to the Holy Land, Megiddo was the site where he met with Israeli dignitaries, including President Zalman Shazar and the Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.

===Battles===
Famous battles include:
* Battle of Megiddo (15th century BCE): fought between the armies of the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III and a large Canaanite coalition led by the rulers of Megiddo and Kadesh.
* Battle of Megiddo (609) BCE: fought between Necho II, pharaoh of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt, and the Kingdom of Judah, during which King Josiah fell.
* Battle of Megiddo (1918): fought during World War I between Allied troops, led by General Edmund Allenby and the defending Ottoman army.

==Archaeological features==
A path leads up through a six-chambered gate, considered by some archaeologists to have been built by Solomon, but which Israel Finkelstein dates to the Omrides, found in Stratum VA-IVB, late Iron IIA period. It overlooks the excavations of the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. A solid circular stone structure has been interpreted as an altar or a high place from the Canaanite period. Further on is a grain pit from the Israelite period for storing provisions in case of siege. There are stables, originally thought to date from the time of Solomon but now dated a century and a half later to the time of Ahab. A water system consists of a square shaft deep, the bottom of which opens into a tunnel bored through rock for to a pool of water.

===The Great Temple===
Megiddo&#x27;s 5,000-year-old &quot;Great Temple&quot;, dated to the Early Bronze Age IB (ca. 3000 BC), has been described by its excavators as &quot;the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered in the EB I Levant and ranks among the largest structures of its time in the Near East.&quot; The structure includes an immense 47.5 by 22 meters sanctuary. The temple was more than ten times larger than a typical temple of that era and was determined to be the site of ritual animal sacrifice. Corridors were used as &quot;favissae&quot; (deposits of cultic artifacts) to store bones after ritual sacrifice. More than 80% of the animal remains were young sheep and goats. The rest were cattle.

===Jewelry===

In 2010, a collection of jewelry pieces was found in a ceramic jug. The jewelry dates to around 1100 BC. The collection includes beads made of carnelian stone, a ring and earrings. The jug was subjected to molecular analysis to determine the contents. The collection was probably owned by a wealthy Canaanite family, likely belonging to the ruling elite.

===Megiddo ivories===
The Megiddo ivories are thin carvings in ivory found at Tel Megiddo, mostly excavated by Gordon Loud. The ivories are on display at the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures in Chicago and the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. They were found in the stratum VIIA or Late Bronze Age layer of the site. Carved from hippopotamus incisors from the Nile, they show Egyptian stylistic influence. An ivory pen case was found inscribed with the cartouche of Ramses III.

===Megiddo stables===
At Megiddo two stable complexes were excavated from Stratum IVA, one in the north and one in the south. Stratum VA-IVB has also been proposed for this area. The southern complex contained five structures built around a lime paved courtyard. The buildings were divided into three sections.

Two long stone paved aisles were built adjacent to a main corridor, paved with lime. The buildings were about twenty-one meters long by eleven meters wide. Separating the main corridor from outside aisles was a series of stone pillars. Holes were bored into many of these pillars so horses could be tied to them. The remains of stone mangers were found in the buildings. These mangers were placed between the pillars to feed the horses.

It is suggested that each side could hold fifteen horses, giving each building an overall capacity of thirty horses. The buildings on the northern side of the city were similar in their construction. There was no central courtyard. The capacity of the buildings of the north was about three hundred horses altogether. Both complexes could hold from 450 to 480 horses combined.

The buildings were found during excavations between 1927 and 1934. The head excavator initially interpreted the buildings as stables. Since then, his conclusions have been challenged by James B. Pritchard, Dr Adrian Curtis of Manchester University Ze&#x27;ev Herzog, and Yohanan Aharoni, who suggest they were storehouses, marketplaces or barracks.

=== The Bronze Age tomb ===
In February 2023, the remains of two elite brothers buried with Cypriot pottery, food and other valuable possessions were found in a Bronze Age tomb. Bioarchaeologists identified the early evidence of a Bronze Age cranial surgery called trepanation in one of the brothers. The study published in PLOS One, reports that the younger brother died in his teens or early 20s, most likely from an infectious illness like leprosy or tuberculosis. The older brother, who died immediately after the surgery, had angular notched trephination and was thought to be between the ages of 20 and 40. A 30-millimetre (1.2-inch) square-shaped hole was created on the frontal bone of the skull after his scalp was cut with a sharp instrument with a bevelled edge.

==Excavations==
Megiddo has been excavated three times and is currently being excavated. The first excavations were carried out between 1903 and 1905 by Gottlieb Schumacher for the German Society for the Study of Palestine, excavating one main north-south trench and some subsidiary trenches and probes. Techniques used were rudimentary by later standards, and Schumacher&#x27;s field notes and records were destroyed in World War I before being published. After the war, Carl Watzinger published the remaining data from the dig.

In 1925, digging was resumed by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., continuing until the outbreak of the Second World War. The work was led initially by Clarence S. Fisher, and later by P. L. O. Guy, Robert Lamon, and Gordon Loud. The Oriental Institute intended to completely excavate the whole tel, layer by layer. Money ran out before they could do so. Today, excavators limit themselves to a square or a trench because they must leave something for future archaeologists with better techniques and methods. During these excavations, it was discovered that there were around eight levels of habitation. Many of the uncovered remains are preserved at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem and the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. The East Slope area of Megiddo was excavated to the bedrock to serve as a spoil area. The full results of that excavation were not published until decades later.

Yigael Yadin conducted excavations in 1960, 1966, 1967 (with Yigal shiloh), and 1971 for the Hebrew University. Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg published the formal results of those digs in Hebrew University&#x27;s &quot;Qedem&quot; 56 (2016).

Since 1994, Megiddo has been the subject of biannual excavation campaigns conducted by the Megiddo Expedition of Tel Aviv University, currently co-directed by Israel Finkelstein, David Ussishkin, and Baruch Halpern with Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University serving as associate director (USA), together with a consortium of international universities. One notable feature of the dig is close on-site cooperation between archaeologists and specialist scientists, with detailed chemical analysis being performed at the dig itself using a field infrared spectrometer.

In 2010, the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, directed by Matthew J. Adams of Bucknell University in cooperation with the Megiddo Expedition, undertook excavations of the eastern extension of the Early Bronze Age town at the site known as Tel Megiddo East.

<text>&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; (; Romanian: &quot;Love From the Linden Tree&quot;) is a song recorded by Moldovan group O-Zone, released around July 2003 in Romania by Media Services as the lead single from their third studio album &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot; (2003). It was written by band founder Dan Balan and produced by , with the latter eventually initiating an unsuccessful lawsuit where he claimed that his alleged contribution as a songwriter had remained uncredited. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, a 1980s-inspired dance-pop, synth-pop, Eurodisco and Europop song, is performed in Romanian, with its lyrics about having sexual intercourse under trees according to Balan. Music critics have described the lyrics as nonsensical or as being about a phone conversation with a love interest. Alongside elements of camp, the track also prominently features a yodelling sequence.

Reviewers have praised the catchy nature of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, while also noting that the song&#x27;s melody and rhythm had a universal appeal in spite of the language barrier imposed on international audiences by the use of the Romanian language. At the 2005 Echo Music Prize in Germany, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; won in the &quot;Single of the Year&quot; category. Commercially, it first topped the Romanian Top 100 in late 2003 before attaining worldwide success throughout 2004 and into 2005, reaching number one in Austria, Wallonia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland, which was something unprecedented for a song in Romanian. Among others, it was certified diamond by the French Syndicat national de l&#x27;édition phonographique (SNEP) and quadruple million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It stands as one of the best-selling singles of all time with sales of over 12 million copies as of October 2007.

Multiple observers have opined that the song&#x27;s international success was fueled by a dance cover released by Italy-based Romanian singer Haiducii in December 2003 by Universo. It first topped the Italian singles chart in early 2004 and eventually also reached number one in Austria and Sweden. Haiducii competed with O-Zone&#x27;s original version in several territories, while also either impacting the charts before the original or outpeaking it in some regions. Haiducii&#x27;s cover was involved in a controversy in which Balan claimed that it was released without his permission. The original &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was further popularized by a Japanese animated video circulating on the internet, which in turn inspired American vlogger Gary Brolsma to use the song in his video &quot;Numa Numa Dance&quot; in December 2004. Featuring him sitting in a chair in front of his computer and dancing to &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in a cheerful manner, the clip went viral, with it standing as one of the most-viewed internet videos of all time and consolidating the song&#x27;s status as a meme.

The original &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was accompanied by a music video directed by Dmitri Voloshin, which mainly sees the members of O-Zone in the cockpit of a plane, as well as dancing to the song inside it and on one of its wings. For further promotion the group also gave several live performances of the song in Europe, Russia and Japan. In the United States, Balan appeared on &quot;Today&quot; to sing &quot;Ma Ya Hi&quot;, an English language-version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; released exclusively to that region as a collaboration between him and American musician Lucas Prata. Over the years &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; has been used in several other works, which have experienced varying levels of commercial success. In 2008 American rapper T.I. and Barbadian singer Rihanna sampled and interpolated it in &quot;Live Your Life&quot;, which topped the American and British charts. It was also interpolated in French DJ David Guetta and American band OneRepublic&#x27;s successful 2024 single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Wait&quot;, among others. Furthermore, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was featured in several films, including &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005) and &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011).

==Background and writing==

O-Zone is a Moldovan Eurodance group established in 1999. In 2002, the band, which consisted of founder Dan Balan, Radu Sîrbu and Arsenie Todiraș, moved to Romania where they found success with their singles &quot;Numai tu&quot; and &quot;Despre tine&quot;. The latter reached number one on the Romanian Top 100 in February 2003. In April 2003, the group recorded the follow-up &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; at the MOF Records studio with the assistance of . It was written and composed by Balan, while the production was handled by Popoiag; the latter also mastered the track.

Around September 2004, Popoiag filed a lawsuit against Balan and Media Services, the label that signed O-Zone, at the , claiming that he had not received credit for his alleged contribution as a composer of the song. Balan countersued for defamation, and won the case, with Popoiag ordered to award him 60 million ROL after failing to present evidence for his claims. Balan announced that he would donate the money to the winner of a songwriting competititon.

==Release and marketing==

&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was first released as the lead single from O-Zone&#x27;s third studio album &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot; (2003) in Romania by local label Media Services. As part of an almost 100,000 euro-deal, it was eventually licensed to Italian label Time Records, who in turn authorized various labels in Europe to issue the song. Mentions of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in Romanian media date back to at least July 2003, and its copyright was in August 2003. A CD of the song was released in Romania in 2003 by Cat Music, also containing the music videos of previous singles &quot;Numai tu&quot; and &quot;Despre tine&quot;.

Throughout 2004, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was physically released in several other countries, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In France, the track was first released on 14 April 2004 and was aided by an advertising campaign on local television channels and radio stations. The song received a similar treatment in Germany, with it additionally being advertised at half-time during soccer matches and O-Zone partnering with travel agencies. As part of the 2004 international reissue of &quot;Despre tine&quot;, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was featured as the B-side on CDs released in selected regions.

Also in 2004, Ultra Records issued two 12-inch vinyls in the United States that included &quot;Ma Ya Hi&quot;, an English language-version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; featuring American musician Lucas Prata. This version was recorded in Milan, Italy, and was written by both Balan and Prata. &quot;Ma Ya Hi&quot; included only Balan out of the other band members, and media reports speculated that this caused internal tensions within O-Zone. &quot;Ma Ya Hi&quot; was included on Prata&#x27;s studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (2006), while a remixed version was featured on the American version of &quot;DiscO-Zone&quot;. The original Romanian version of the song was digitally released in the United States on 22 June 2004 by Media Services, under the name of &quot;Mai Ai Hee (Dragostea din tei)&quot;. In 2005, a CD of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was issued in Japan by Avex Trax, titled &quot;恋のマイアヒ&quot; (&quot;Koi No Maiahi&quot;).

==Composition and lyrics==

&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; is a 1980s-inspired dance-pop, synth-pop, Eurodisco, and Europop song, whose instrumentation features synthesized bass and what &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; described as &quot;robotic stop-start rhythms&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; staff has described &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; as a novelty song, while several other publications have pointed out elements of camp. The song is set in the key of A minor and has a tempo of 130 beats per minute (BPM). It follows a F-C-G-Am chord progression. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; is performed in Romanian and mentions the linden tree (Romanian: &quot;tei&quot;), which is commonly used in Romanian literature. Throughout the song, its title is pronounced in an ambiguous way that could lead the listener to hear the phrase &quot;Dragostea dintâi&quot; (Romanian: &quot;The first love&quot;).

While Balan has stated that the lyrics describe having sexual intercourse under trees, other publications have argued that they were nonsensical. &quot;The Believer&quot; Douglas Wolk called them &quot;nonspecific&quot;, but elaborated that they were the lyrical subject&#x27;s side of a phone conversation with their love interest. The former also mentions beeping the latter, which &quot;&quot; Pietro Minto pointed out as something emblematic of the &quot;adolescent life in the early 2000s&quot;. During the song, O-Zone refer to themselves as hajduks and Pablo Picasso. In the English version, &quot;hajduk&quot; is replaced with duke, and Picasso is further referenced through the addition of lines such as &quot;I will paint my words of love / With your name of every wall&quot;.

The sequence &quot;Ma-ia-hii, Ma-ia-huu, Ma-ia-hoo, Ma-ia-haha&quot; is prominently yodeled at the beginning and during the track. Analyzing the delivery, Ulf Lippitz of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; thought that Balan provided vocals similar to those found in old Romanian folk songs. In the refrain, the words &quot;nu mă, nu mă iei&quot; (Romanian: &quot;won&#x27;t, won&#x27;t take me&quot;) are repeated as the lyrical subject details their love interest wanting to leave them; this has been perceived as &quot;numa numa yay&quot; by foreign listeners, prompting &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; to also be referred to as the &quot;Numa Numa Song&quot;. In the English version of the track, this sequence is changed to &quot;Oo-aa-oo-aa-ay&quot;, which Wolk criticized for not having the &quot;baby-talk singability&quot; of the original.

==Critical reception and accolades==
Music critics have praised the catchy nature of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, with &quot;The Believer&quot; Wolk writing that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s scarcely a second without some extraordinary hook, starting with the wordless keening at the beginning&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that the song &quot;wobbles unsteadily along the line that separates catchy from infuriating&quot;. laut.de&#x27;s Alexander Cordas categorized &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; as &quot;unpretentious&quot; and &quot;simple light music&quot;. Dana Dorian of &quot;Jurnalul&quot; echoed this thought, writing that the composition was &quot;puerile and very predictable&quot;, meant for &quot;the masses, [...] regardless of the language they speak&quot;. She further called the voices &quot;thin, not at all technical and studied&quot;, but concluded that &quot;neither do they need more&quot;.

Another topic of discussion among music critics was the nonsensical nature of the song&#x27;s lyrics. While this was criticized by &quot;Libertatea&quot; Petre Dobrescu, who likened this aspect to the band&#x27;s other work, Harald Peters of &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; regarded it as something that &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; had in common with other worldwide hits such as &quot;The Ketchup Song (Aserejé)&quot; (2002) by the Spanish group Las Ketchup. Other reviewers opined that it did not matter for the success of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; that the lyrics were written in a foreign language because the song&#x27;s melody and rhythm had a universal appeal that transcended language barriers. &quot;The Believer&quot; Wolk concluded that the song had a refrain &quot;as big as an abandoned government building&quot; which allowed &quot;huge legions of drunk people [to] sing easily [to]&quot;.

Some critics saw &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; as part of a trend where music by artists originating from the Eastern European countries in the Eastern Bloc, including Russian duo t.A.T.u. and Ukrainian singer Ruslana, would become popular across Europe. Lippitz of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; opined that this was facilitated by the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, which allowed said territories to be exposed to Western media and trends. Other reviewers have likened &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; to works by Austrian singer DJ Ötzi, as well as to the song &quot;Chihuahua&quot; (2003) by Swiss musician DJ BoBo. At the MTV Romania Music Awards 2004, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Best Single&quot;. It also won in the &quot;Single of the Year&quot; category at the 2005 Echo Music Prize in Germany, and was nominated for &quot;Foreign Radio Hit&quot; and &quot;Ringtone of the Year&quot; at the 2005 .

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was a commercial success. As of October 2007, it has sold in excess of 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Among several achievements, it stands as the third-most successful song of the 2000s in Germany, and as the fourth best-selling track of the 21st century in France with 1,170,000 copies moved as of September 2014. At one point, it was Japan&#x27;s best-selling digital single with four million units sold until surpassed by &quot;Flavor of Life&quot; by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada in 2007.

===Initial domestic success in 2003 and international recognition in 2004===

&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; first attained commercial success in Romania, where it held the number-one position on the Romanian Top 100 for three weeks in September 2003, making it the band&#x27;s second number-one after &quot;Despre tine&quot; earlier that year. By April 2004, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; had sold over 250,000 copies in Romania. In March 2004, the song reached number 17 on the Italian singles chart. One month later, it debuted at number one in Spain―the first country outside of Romania where the song received radio support―reclimbing to the chart&#x27;s top position on two more occasions in May and June 2004. In April 2004, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; further topped the French chart, holding that spot for 15 consecutive weeks. At one point, five versions of the song were present in the top 20 in France—the original, a cover recorded by Romanian singer Haiducii, as well as the parodies &quot;Ma cé ki? Massimo&quot; by Italian media personality , &quot;Le poulailler&quot; by French radio station and &quot;Argent-Argent&quot; by French host Cauet and Mopral. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was eventually certified diamond in the region by Syndicat national de l&#x27;édition phonographique (SNEP).

By June 2004, the song had shipped around 500,000 copies in Europe. From June to August 2004, it impacted several other territories. It reached number one in all DACH countries, holding that position for 14 weeks in Germany and Switzerland, and for 13 weeks in Austria. In Germany, it was certified double platinum by Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). In the Netherlands, the song topped the Dutch Single Top 100. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was also successful in Nordic countries, becoming a number-one hit in Norway and Denmark, as well as peaking at numbers two and three in Finland and Sweden, respectively. The song further topped &quot;Billboard&quot; European Hot 100 Singles chart for 12 weeks, at one point being followed by Haiducii&#x27;s version at number two and &quot;Le poulailler&quot; at number 18. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; peaked at numbers one, two and three in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom, respectively, while a remixed version, the &quot;Unu&#x27; in the Dub Mix&quot;, peaked at number nine on the radio airplay chart in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The song topped the 2004 year-end charts in Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as the year-end list of the European Hot 100 Singles chart, among others.

===Continued success in the United States and Japan in 2005===
In the United States, the Lucas Prata version reached number 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart at the end of August 2004, however it was not until March 2005 that the song peaked at number 16 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, as well as at positions 69 and 72 on the Digital Song Sales and Pop 100 rankings, respectively. As of that month, it had sold over 35,000 digital downloads in the region, and was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In his book &quot;The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World&quot;, Frans Johansson attributed the song&#x27;s mediocre performance in the United States to Ultra Records not having &quot;the experience or resources to successfully market [it]&quot;, further noting that &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; had been released there &quot;at a time when techno-based club tracks were ebbing in popularity [...] [and] airwaves were dominated by R&amp;B and hip-hop&quot;. According to Johansson, the song&#x27;s resulting poor sales and radio performance were the reasons for Ultra Records pulling back all promotional efforts and cancelling plans to tour the United States. In Japan, the original version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; peaked at number 72 on the Oricon Singles Chart in June 2005, with the song being awarded quadruple million, platinum and gold certifications by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) across multiple formats.

==Virality==


In Japan, an anonymous user nicknamed Ikari used &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in an animated video which features a character that resembles Monā, a popular cat frequently illustrated with typed symbols by users on the Japanese textboard 2channel. During the clip, Romanian lyrics in the song are purposefully misheard as English or Japanese expressions—for example, &quot;salut&quot; (Romanian: &quot;hello&quot;) is accompanied by an image of a &quot;monkey&quot; (Japanese: &quot;saru&quot;), while &quot;fericirea&quot; (Romanian: &quot;happiness&quot;) is misheard as &quot;looking up for a skirt&quot; (Japanese: &quot;panchira&quot;) and &quot;nu mă, nu mă iei&quot; as &quot;drink, drink, yay&quot; (Japanese: &quot;noma, noma, yay&quot;). The video became popular, prompting other similar clips to be created by fellow users globally. In response, O-Zone&#x27;s Japanese label Avex Trax launched merchandise depicting what they called the &quot;Noma neko&quot; (&quot;Noma cat&quot;).

Having reportedly come across the song through Ikari&#x27;s video, American vlogger Gary Brolsma lip-synched to &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in a video that he posted to website Newgrounds on 6 December 2004. Called &quot;Numa Numa Dance&quot;, the clip sees Brolsma sitting in a chair in front of his computer and dancing to the song. Wren Graves of &quot;Consequence&quot; elaborated: &quot;At times he is almost still, holding his mouth open wide or punctuating a musical moment with a perfectly-timed raised eyebrow. [...] [A]nd then a sudden obliteration of matter — a solid man becoming pure, dancing air. Brolsma captures all the joy of the chorus with a sly humor and full commitment, [...] pump[ing] his fists above his head&quot;. Shortly after, the video went viral, with reported views of 700 million as of November 2006, giving Brolsma mainstream media&#x27;s coverage and inspiring several parodies and remakes. It is regarded as one of the most-watched internet videos of all time, with &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; consequently also becoming a meme. Referring to this phenomenon as &quot;numanumamania&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot; Wolk wrote that Brolsma&#x27;s video was &quot;better advertising for [...] &#x27;Dragostea din tei&#x27; than anything a record label could have paid for&quot;. Francesco Gerardi, writing for &quot;Rivista Studio&quot;, opined that &quot;Numa Numa Dance&quot; was instrumental in the song&#x27;s chart entrance in the United States.

==Promotion==
===Music video===
An accompanying music video for &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, directed and animated by Dmitri Voloshin, was released in 2004 at the latest. The video opens with Todiraș stretching on a couch as elements of &quot;Despre tine&quot; play. Following this, shots of a fictional futuristic city from the &quot;Numai tu&quot; music video are shown, as well as of a magazine advertizing O-Zone&#x27;s comeback paired with highlights of the &quot;Despre tine&quot; video. Subsequently, the group is shown running to the exit of a building and towards a plane. They enter its cockpit and take off as &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; starts playing. They are then seen dancing to the song on one of the airborne aircraft&#x27;s wings, as well as dancing inside the plane and recording at a studio. All wear white pants and colorful shirts, with Todiraș and Balan&#x27;s open to the waist and paired with suspenders and glasses.

Computer-generated shots of the flying plane are also shown, with it having a built-in red &quot;on air&quot; sign and engines that turn into speakers. Various animated stills are briefly interspersed throughout the video, among others showing Balan as a cyborg, Sîrbu at a bodybuilding competition, Balan and Todiraș in a laboratory with an alien or them as vampires, Batman, three men of different ethnicities dressed in traditional clothing in front of a dove with an olive branch, and the Moldovan flag. The song ends with an animated shot of the group members in front of a crashed plane in flames, followed by them leaving the site. The video then returns to the opening sequence with Todiraș on the couch as a mellower version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; plays. Balan is seated next to him drawing on his pencil board, and all three members come together smiling to look at Balan&#x27;s sketch. The clip ends with the reveal of the drawing, which is a storyboard of the music video.

In her book &quot;New Media Literacies and Participatory Popular Culture Across Borders&quot;, Bronwyn Williams likened the style of the animations to anime and called them &quot;inexplicable&quot;, concluding that the video was &quot;eminently forgettable&quot;. Minto of &quot;Rivista Studio&quot; called the clip &quot;spectacular&quot;, although noting that the dance scenes were &quot;out-of-context&quot; and the special effects low quality and &quot;botched&quot;. In the book &quot;Von Hora, Doina und Lăutaren&quot;, Marina Cap-Bun elaborates on the possibility that the video alludes to the Zburător myth. In a 2017 interview, Balan retrospectively opined that the video had helped &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; become a gay anthem, particularly because of the group&#x27;s outfits and display of affection for each other.

===Live performances===
O-Zone performed &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in Germany in 2004 on the television show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; on 3 July, twice on the local version of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and on &quot;The Dome 30&quot;. In France, the group performed the song on the show &quot;Hit Machine&quot;, and further sang it during the fourth season of &quot;Star Academy&quot;. O-Zone also performed &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; on the show &quot;Fabrika Zvyozd&quot; in Russia, and on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the Netherlands. In 2005, the group sang the track on shows in Japan, including on &quot;Music Station&quot; and &quot;SMAPxSMAP&quot;, and Balan also appeared with Prata to sing &quot;Ma Ya Hi&quot; on &quot;Today&quot; in the United States. Before disbanding in 2005, O-Zone gave a performance of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; at the Romanian Golden Stag Festival in September 2005. They also performed it during their reunions for Europe Day on 9 May 2017 at University Square in Bucharest, and on the occasion of New Year&#x27;s Eve at the Constitution Square in 2019 in the same city.

==Legacy==
&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; is the first song in Romanian to have achieved international success. While &quot;Libertatea&quot; wrote that it had &quot;done more for Romania&#x27;s image than all politicians put together&quot;, Balan stated in an interview that, for him, &quot;the greatest pride is the fact that [he] promoted the Romanian language&quot;. Paul Sexton of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote how &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; served as a &quot;reminder of music&#x27;s power to connect across borders&quot;, further noting that it &quot;managed to convey uninhibited joy better than any phrase in the English language probably could&quot;. &quot;Rivista Studio&quot; Minto views the song&#x27;s &quot;conquest of the West [...] in a language atypical of contemporary pop&quot; as a &quot;very rare event&quot;, likening it to the popularity of South Korean rapper Psy&#x27;s 2012 single &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; performed in Korean.

Minto further regards &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; as a precursor to modern virality, writing that &quot;[t]he cultural diffusion of the song – and its mutation into a &#x27;catchphrase&#x27; – can be placed at a point of transition between [Los del Río&#x27;s 1993 single] &#x27;Macarena&#x27; – which exploded in a pre-mass internet era – and &#x27;Gangnam Style&#x27; – which instead blossomed on the now high crests of global social networks&quot;. Elaborating on the impact of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot; Wolk opined that &quot;not even the words but the sound of the recording [are] now part of the fabric of the internet. It&#x27;s bypassed the monolithic American entertainment industry to become a standard&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was included on &quot;Billboard&quot; ranking of the &quot;100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time&quot; at number 82. The American edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it at number 18 on their &quot;50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time&quot; ranking in 2015, with the Australian edition of the publication listing it at number 27 on their &quot;75 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time&quot; ranking in 2020.

==Use in popular media==

&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; has been adapted in over 35 languages. The 2004 parodies &quot;Le poulailler&quot; by Le 6–9 and &quot;Ma cé ki? Massimo&quot; by Gargia were both top 10 hits in France and competed with the original version and Haiducii&#x27;s cover on the charts there. In 2008, American rapper T.I. and Barbadian singer Rihanna released &quot;Live Your Life&quot;, which samples and interpolates &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;. The song became an international success, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaking at number two in the United Kingdom, among others.

Balan covered the song in 2006 on &quot;Sugar Tunes Numa Numa&quot; with his rock band Balan, and in 2008 on &quot;Numa Numa 2&quot; for his project Crazy Loop as a B-side to the single &quot;Mm-ma-ma&quot;. He also used the refrain of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; on the identically named, but unrelated &quot;Numa Numa 2&quot; featuring American singer Marley Waters in 2018. In 2024, French DJ David Guetta and American band OneRepublic interpolated &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; on their single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Wait&quot;, which reached the top 20 in multiple territories including Germany and the United Kingdom. Acts such as Romanian singer Inna and American band Bloodhound Gang have covered or parodied &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; live, with the song also having been covered by various artists on &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot; internationally.

The original or alternative versions of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; have been used in multiple films, including in &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005) for a reported payment of one million US$, &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot; (2005), &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011), and &quot;It&#x27;s Only the End of the World&quot; (2016), as well as throughout the telenovela &quot;Triunfo del amor&quot; (2010–2011), and the series &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; (2009–2011). The song was furthermore included on the dance video game &quot;Just Dance 2017&quot;, as well as used for commercials by companies such as Yakult, &quot;Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe&quot; (BVG), Lazada, AliExpress, and Ant Bank.

==Release history==
==Haiducii version==
===Background and composition===
Italy-based Romanian singer Paula Monica Mitrache recorded a cover of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; after having been advised to do so by her label Universo, although she had initially opposed to the idea. Her stage name, Haiducii, was inspired by the mention of hajduks in the song. The cover was produced and mixed by Max Minoia at MM Studio in Rome, Italy, and features uncredited vocals by Italian singer Vittorio Centrone, who notably provides the &quot;Ma-ia-hii, Ma-ia-huu, Ma-ia-hoo, Ma-ia-haha&quot; sequence. This dance version was reframed as a conversation between a man and a woman, which Francesco Gerardi of &quot;Rivista Studio&quot; likened to &quot;&quot; (1974) by Italian singer Claudia Mori.

===Release===
&quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was serviced as Haiducii&#x27;s debut single in December 2003 in Italy by Universo. It was physically released in various countries throughout 2004, including in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United States. The CDs and vinyls all included a remix produced by Italian DJ and group Eiffel 65 member Gabry Ponte. A remix EP was made available for digital download on 3 August 2004 in various countries. In 2005, a CD was released in Taiwan by Avex Trax under the title of &quot;嘜阿喜&quot; (&quot;Mai A Hi&quot;), featuring cartoon characters on its cover that were used to promote the song in the region. &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; was eventually included on Haiducii&#x27;s sole studio album, &quot;Paula Mitrache in Haiducii&quot; (2008). A remix, titled &quot;Dragostea din tei 2k13&quot;, was released in 2012, featuring the contribution of Eiffel 65 lead vocalist Jeffrey Jey alongside Ponte. On 11 August 2023, Haiducii issued a solo re-recording of the song for its 20th anniversary.

===Commercial performance===

In several territories, Haiducii&#x27;s version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; impacted the charts before O-Zone&#x27;s original, including in Germany, Italy, Spain, and France. It debuted atop the Italian singles chart in January 2004 with 200,000 copies sold, outpeaking the original. Significantly aided by the Gabry Ponte remix, the song claimed the top position for a total of six weeks and remained within the top 10 for over four months. In March 2004, Haiducii&#x27;s version debuted and peaked at number four in Spain, following which she reached numbers one and two in Austria and France, respectively, in April. The track also reached number two in Wallonia in May 2004, being held from number one by the original.

In June 2004, the cover peaked at number two in Germany—behind by the original—and Switzerland, as well as number four in Norway and number six in Flanders. Throughout July, it ranked behind O-Zone&#x27;s original at number two on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, while also peaking at numbers four, five and seven in the Netherlands, Denmark and Hungary, respectively. In Sweden, Haiducii topped the chart in August, outcharting the original. It held the top spot for five consecutive weeks and spent five months in the top ten. For the year of 2004, Haiducii&#x27;s version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; ended within the top 10 of the best-performing singles in Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, as well as on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. It was further awarded gold certifications in Austria, Belgium, France, Sweden and Switzerland. As of February 2021, the song has sold one million copies in Europe.

===Promotion===
An accompanying music video was released in 2004 at the latest. It opens with a man entering a hotel room and throwing himself on the bed. He then proceeds to walk through the room and the hallway of the hotel seemingly confused and in search of something. Haiducii, meanwhile sitting in another room, is watching him on a TV that shows the footage of a surveillance camera. The man ultimately finds a hidden camera and walks to Haiducii&#x27;s room, which is now empty. He watches the footage on the aforementioned TV, which now depicts her leaving through the hallway in a red fur outfit. The video often has its screen split in four, and includes interspersed shots of Haiducii dancing to the song wearing different dresses.

For further promotion, Haiducii performed the song as a musical guest at the Italian Sanremo Music Festival 2004 on 4 March 2004, as well as on the local version of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. She also sang &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; in Germany on &quot;Interaktiv&quot;, as well as in France on &#x27;. In 2020, she appeared on &#x27; in Germany. In 2023, she performed on &quot;ZDF-Fernsehgarten&quot; in the same region on 7 May, as well as on &quot;&quot; in Italy on 27 September. Haiducii further made an appearance during Centrone&#x27;s audition on the Italian version of &quot;The Voice Senior&quot; in 2024 to sing the song with him.

===Dispute over legality and impact on the original version===
In February 2004, Balan claimed that, although he had been credited as a songwriter, Haiducii&#x27;s cover was released without his permission. He threatened to sue Haiducii and Universo if they would not pull back her version. According to Balan, they had relied on an Italian law which they alleged allowed the release of covers. However, he concluded that such a law did not exist and would not apply to Haiducii, a Romanian citizen, as well as not to &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot;, which had been recorded in Romania first. Gerardi of &quot;Rivista Studio&quot; wrote that Haiducii &quot;didn&#x27;t even ask permission&quot; for her cover, but concluded that this was &quot;a pracice that was still legal at that time&quot;. In a 2016 interview, Haiducii said that no legal action had been taken against her cover.

Multiple observers argued that Haiducii&#x27;s cover was a key factor in bringing international attention to the original version. &quot;Rivista Studio&quot; Gerardi wrote: &quot;[In 2003, &#x27;Dragostea din tei&#x27; by O-Zone] had achieved a fair amount of success in Romania and Moldova, only to then be forgotten along with many of the things that happen in the summer. But [...] Universo [...] did not miss the commercial potential of the song. [...] [After Haiducii&#x27;s success, Balan] called all the people he knew in the music industry to find one who would reissue [the original] &#x27;Dragostea din tei&#x27; and give the single global distribution&quot;. According to media reports, Haiducii&#x27;s success was also the reason why O-Zone postponed their intended disbandment in December 2003. Balan saw the coexistence of Haiducii&#x27;s cover as an impediment in commercializing the original version internationally, since O-Zone &quot;[had] to convince other labels [...] that the original song belong[ed] to [them]&quot;.

===Other usage===
A version of the song titled &quot;Maya Hi, Maya Hu&quot; credited to Swedish animated character Crazy Frog was released in 2009. In 2019, Haiducii and Catholic pastor Don Allessandrou Cosu published &quot;Parliamo di Gesú&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Jesus&quot;) on YouTube, which is an alternate version of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; with rewritten religious lyrics. The accompanying music video, which was filmed in a church, went viral on Italian social media in 2021. In June 2023, Caffellatte and Haiducii released &quot;Troppo Chic (Dragostea din tei)&quot;, which uses portions of &quot;Dragostea din tei&quot; that Haiducii re-recorded. She also took part in promotional endeavours for the song on television.

<doc id="614040" wikidata="Q54980267" url="?curid=614040" title="Intransitivity">
<text>In mathematics, intransitivity (sometimes called nontransitivity) is a property of binary relations that are not transitive relations. That is, we can find three values formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 where the transitive condition does not hold. 

Antitransitivity is a stronger property which describes a relation where, for any three values, the transitivity condition never holds.

Some authors use the term to refer to antitransitivity.

== Intransitivity ==

A relation is transitive if, whenever it relates some A to some B, and that B to some C, it also relates that A to that C. A relation is if it is not transitive. Assuming the relation is named formula_4, it is intransitive if:

formula_5

This statement is equivalent to
formula_6

For example, the inequality relation, formula_7, is intransitive. This can be demonstrated by replacing formula_4 with formula_7 and choosing formula_10, formula_11, and formula_12. We have formula_13 and formula_14 and it is not true that formula_15.

Notice that, for a relation to be intransitive, the transitivity condition just has to be not true at some formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3. It can still hold for others. For example, it holds when formula_10, formula_11, and formula_21, then formula_13 and formula_23 and it is true that formula_24.

For a more complicated example of intransitivity, consider the relation &quot;R&quot; on the integers such that &quot;a R b&quot; if and only if &quot;a&quot; is a multiple of &quot;b&quot; or a divisor of &quot;b&quot;. This relation is intransitive since, for example, 2 &quot;R&quot; 6 (2 is a divisor of 6) and 6 &quot;R&quot; 3 (6 is a multiple of 3), but 2 is neither a multiple nor a divisor of 3. This does not imply that the relation is (see below); for example, 2 &quot;R&quot; 6, 6 &quot;R&quot; 12, and 2 &quot;R&quot; 12 as well.

An example in biology comes from the food chain. Wolves feed on deer, and deer feed on grass, but wolves do not feed on grass. Thus, the relation among life forms is intransitive, in this sense.

== Antitransitivity ==

Antitransitivity for a relation says that the transitive condition does not hold for any three values. 

In the example above, the relation is not transitive, but it still contains some transitivity: for instance, humans feed on rabbits, rabbits feed on carrots, and humans also feed on carrots.

A relation is if this never occurs at all. The formal definition is:
formula_25

For example, the relation &quot;R&quot; on the integers, such that &quot;a R b&quot; if and only if &quot;a + b&quot; is odd, is intransitive. If &quot;a R b&quot; and &quot;b R c&quot;, then either &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are both odd and &quot;b&quot; is even, or vice-versa. In either case, &quot;a + c&quot; is even.

A second example of an antitransitive relation: the &quot;defeated&quot; relation in knockout tournaments. If player A defeated player B and player B defeated player C, A can have never played C, and therefore, A has not defeated C.

By transposition, each of the following formulas is equivalent to antitransitivity of &quot;R&quot;:
formula_26

===Properties===

* An antitransitive relation is always irreflexive.
* An antitransitive relation on a set of ≥4 elements is never connex. On a 3-element set, the depicted cycle has both properties.
* An irreflexive and left- (or right-) unique relation is always anti-transitive. An example of the former is the &quot;mother&quot; relation. If &quot;A&quot; is the mother of &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; the mother of &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; cannot be the mother of &quot;C&quot;.
* If a relation &quot;R&quot; is antitransitive, so is each subset of &quot;R&quot;.

== Cycles ==

The term is often used when speaking of scenarios in which a relation describes the relative preferences between pairs of options, and weighing several options produces a &quot;loop&quot; of preference:

* A is preferred to B
* B is preferred to C
* C is preferred to A

Rock, paper, scissors; intransitive dice; and Penney&#x27;s game are examples. Real combative relations of competing species, strategies of individual animals, and fights of remote-controlled vehicles in BattleBots shows (&quot;robot Darwinism&quot;) can be cyclic as well.

Assuming no option is preferred to itself i.e. the relation is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive. For if it is, each option in the loop is preferred to each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, also A is preferred to C. But then, since C is preferred to A, also A is preferred to A.

Therefore such a preference loop (or ) is known as an .

Notice that a cycle is neither necessary nor sufficient for a binary relation to be not transitive. For example, an equivalence relation possesses cycles but is transitive. Now, consider the relation &quot;is an enemy of&quot; and suppose that the relation is symmetric and satisfies the condition that for any country, any enemy of an enemy of the country is not itself an enemy of the country. This is an example of an antitransitive relation that does not have any cycles. In particular, by virtue of being antitransitive the relation is not transitive.

The game of rock, paper, scissors is an example. The relation over rock, paper, and scissors is &quot;defeats&quot;, and the standard rules of the game are such that rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, and paper defeats rock. Furthermore, it is also true that scissors does not defeat rock, paper does not defeat scissors, and rock does not defeat paper. Finally, it is also true that no option defeats itself. This information can be depicted in a table:
The first argument of the relation is a row and the second one is a column. Ones indicate the relation holds, zero indicates that it does not hold. Now, notice that the following statement is true for any pair of elements x and y drawn (with replacement) from the set {rock, scissors, paper}: If x defeats y, and y defeats z, then x does not defeat z. Hence the relation is antitransitive.

Thus, a cycle is neither necessary nor sufficient for a binary relation to be antitransitive.

== Occurrences in preferences ==

* Intransitivity can occur under majority rule, in probabilistic outcomes of game theory, and in the Condorcet voting method in which ranking several candidates can produce a loop of preference when the weights are compared (see voting paradox). 
* Intransitive dice demonstrate that the relation &quot; &quot;X&quot; rolls a higher number than die &quot;Y&quot; more than half the time&quot; need not be transitive.
* In psychology, intransitivity often occurs in a person&#x27;s system of values (or preferences, or tastes), potentially leading to unresolvable conflicts.
* Analogously, in economics intransitivity can occur in a consumer&#x27;s preferences. This may lead to consumer behaviour that does not conform to perfect economic rationality. Economists and philosophers have questioned whether violations of transitivity must necessarily lead to &#x27;irrational behaviour&#x27; (see Anand (1993)).

== Likelihood ==

It has been suggested that Condorcet voting tends to eliminate &quot;intransitive loops&quot; when large numbers of voters participate because the overall assessment criteria for voters balances out. For instance, voters may prefer candidates on several different units of measure such as by order of social consciousness or by order of most fiscally conservative.

In such cases intransitivity reduces to a broader equation of numbers of people and the weights of their units of measure in assessing candidates.

Such as:

* 30% favor 60/40 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism
* 50% favor 50/50 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism
* 20% favor a 40/60 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism

While each voter may not assess the units of measure identically, the trend then becomes a single vector on which the consensus agrees is a preferred balance of candidate criteria.

<text>The Federal Highway is a highway in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It is a part of a motorway-standard link between Sydney and Canberra, and is also the main thoroughfare between those cities.

The north-eastern end of the Federal Highway is located at its junction with Hume Highway near the rural city of Goulburn. It runs southwest to Canberra, the national capital of Australia, where its southwestern end is located at the intersection of Northbourne Avenue and Barton Highway. The Federal Highway passes the villages of Wollogorang, and , as well as skirting the western side of the endorheic basin containing Lake George.

==Route==
Federal Highway is a motorway-standard roadway linking from the interchange with Hume Highway at , southeast of Goulburn, to Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. The roadway has a continuous speed limit within New South Wales northbound. A southbound section between the Great Dividing Range, south of Yarra, and Rowes Lagoon, north of Collector, is on an old and winding alignment and has a speed limit of 100k/h with many lower advisory speed signs. Within the Australian Capital Territory the posted speed limit is between the State-border and Antill Street, between Antil Street and Flemington Road, and between Flemington Road and the end of the road at Barton Highway (where the road runs parallel with the Canberra Metro light rail route). The entire length of the roadway is dual carriageway with 2 lanes in each direction.

==History==
In New South Wales, the passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). The New South Wales section of Federal Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 3) on 8 August 1928, from its interchange with Hume Highway in Yarra, via Collector and Geary&#x27;s Gap, to the interstate border; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 3 on 8 April 1929. Construction had already been completed and traffic was already using the portion of the highway within New South Wales by December 1930.

In the Federal Capital Territory, the local Sydney-Canberra Road was officially declared part of Federal Highway in September 1928. Surveying and levelling had finished and work had started in April 1929 to connect to the NSW portion of the road, with the contract awarded to John Fowler (Aust) Ltd, to construct a 6-mile section of highway from Canberra (today Lyneham) to the interstate boundary. Approaching completion by February 1930, it was officially completed and opened on 25 February 1931.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Federal Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 3, from Yarra to the interstate border with the ACT.

Federal Highway was allocated National Route 23 across its entire length in 1955. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, the Federal Highway was declared a National Highway in 1974 and was consequently re-allocated National Highway 23. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route M23 across the New South Wales&#x27; section, and route A23 across the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s section; an eastern portion was upgraded to route M23 when Majura Parkway opened in 2016.

<text>Puno (Aymara and ) is a city in southeastern Peru, located on the shore of Lake Titicaca. It is the capital city of the Puno Region and the Puno Province with a population of approximately 140,839 (2015 estimate). The city was established in 1668 by viceroy Pedro Antonio Fernández de Castro as capital of the province of Paucarcolla with the name San Juan Bautista de Puno. The name was later changed to San Carlos de Puno, in honor of king Charles II of Spain. Puno has several churches dating back from the colonial period; they were built to service the Spanish population and evangelize the Quechua people.

== Overview ==

Puno is an important agricultural and livestock region; important livestock are llamas and alpacas, which graze on its immense plateaus and plains. Much of the city economy relies on the black market, fueled by cheap goods smuggled in from Bolivia. Puno is served by the Inca Manco Capac International Airport in nearby Juliaca.
Puno is situated between the shores of Lake Titicaca and the mountains surrounding the city. There is less than two miles of flat land between the shores and the foothills, which has caused the growing city to continue to expand upwards onto the hillsides. As a result, the town&#x27;s less developed and poorest areas, which are high on the hillsides, often have very steep streets, which are generally unpaved and cannot be accessed by automobile.

Up one of these streets is the Kuntur Wasi viewpoint, which has a large metal sculpture of a condor. There are some 700 steps to climb to reach the sculpture.

During the celebrations of the Feast of the &quot;Virgen de la Candelaria&quot; and the Regional Competition of Autochthonous Dances. Puno&#x27;s access to Lake Titicaca is surrounded by 41 floating islands. To this day, the Uros people maintain and live on these man-made islands, depending on the lake for their survival, and are a large tourist destination. Dragon boat racing, an old tradition in Puno, is a very popular activity amongst tourists.

Puno is the first major hub in the constant migration of indigenous peoples of the Andes to the larger cities of Peru. It is the largest city in the Southern Altiplano and is the recipient of new residents from surrounding smaller agricultural communities of people seeking better opportunities for education and employment. As such, Puno is served by several small institutes of technology, education and other technical or junior college-type facilities. Additionally it is home to the &quot;Universidad Nacional del Altiplano de Puno&quot; (UNAP), which was founded in 1856.

==Climate==
Puno features an subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification).

As Puno is located at such a high elevation, it experiences more extreme weather conditions than would be expected for its tropical latitude. The average annual temperature is about , and the weather never gets overly warm. During the winter months from June to August, night-time temperatures usually drop below . At this high altitude, the rays of the sun are very strong. Most of the annual precipitation falls during the southern hemisphere summer, with the winter months being very dry.


== Folklore ==

Music and dance are typical parts of the Puno folklore. The most important dances are the &quot;Wifala de Asillo&quot;, the Ichu Carnival, the Tuntuna, the &quot;Khashua de Capachica&quot;, the &quot;Machu-tusuj&quot;, the &quot;Kcajelo&quot;, and the &quot;Pandilla Puneña&quot;.

<text>Waldo is a ghost town in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States.

==Description==
The community was created along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway just west of Cerrillos. Today little remains, although the name appears on a freeway exit on Interstate 25, some distance to the west. Today, Waldo is a siding along the line of the BNSF Railway, which is part of the former Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

Waldo was at the junction of the AT&amp;SF main east–west line and the Madrid spur. There were coke ovens in Waldo, supplied by coal from Madrid. The spur itself no longer exists. The ovens were on the south side of the rail line, and the town on the north. The rail line parallels the Galisteo River.

<text>Barton Highway is a highway in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It connects Canberra to Hume Highway at Yass, and it is part of the route from Melbourne to Canberra. It is named in honour of Sir Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia.

==Route==
Barton Highway commences at the interchange with Hume Highway northeast of Yass and heads in a southerly direction as a four-lane, dual-carriageway freeway, before narrowing to a two-lane, single-carriageway highway south of the interchange with Yass Valley Way where it meets its old alignment, and continues south through undulating hills to the village of , before crossing the border into the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) just outside the village of , before eventually terminating at the intersection with Federal Highway and Northbourne Avenue at .

The Gundaroo Drive/Barton Highway round-about is surrounded by a number of trees to the south of the intersection. The pine tree plantation was originally planted in the shape of a map of Australia.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB, later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 56 was declared along this road on 8 August 1928, from Yass via Murrumbateman to Lyneham (and continuing northwards via Cowra to Forbes, Parkes, Dubbo, Gilgandra and Coonamble eventually to Walgett, and southwards via Canberra eventually to the intersection with Queanbeyan-Braidwood Road, today Kings Highway, at Queanbeyan); with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 56 on 8 April 1929. The original purpose of the &quot;Yass-Canberra Road&quot; was to connect surrounding towns to farming locations in the Yass Valley, and later with the newly-established national capital.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 15 on 19 February 1935, from the intersection with Hume Highway near Yass via Murrumbateman to the border of the Federal Capital Territory (today Australian Capital Territory) at Hall, subsuming the existing portion Trunk Road 56 from Yass to Hall; the southern end of Trunk Road 56 was truncated to meet Hume Highway west of Yass, as a result. State Highway 15 was officially named as Barton Highway on 28 July 1954, and fully sealed by 1960.

The first realignment occurred during the late 1970s, when the southern terminus of the highway was relocated north, to the north of the Yowani Country Club. In 1980 the village of Hall was bypassed; and during the early 1990s a dual carriageway was completed on the ACT section of the highway, between Hall and . A further section of dual carriageways was completed in December 2002, between Gungahlin Drive and the southern terminus with the Federal Highway.

Between April 1993 and May 1995, as part of the Hume Highway bypass of Yass, a dual carriageway deviation of Barton Highway was constructed to connect Barton Highway with the new alignment of Hume Highway, north of Yass. The new route crosses the Yass River on twin bridges to the east of Cooma Cottage before terminating at a trumpet interchange with Hume Highway, about northeast of Yass. The highway&#x27;s former alignment, near the historic Cooma Cottage, east of the Yass River, was renamed Kirkton Road and Dog Trap Road.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Barton Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 15, from the intersection with Hume Highway near Yass to the border of the Australian Capital Territory at Hall.

Barton Highway was signed National Route 25 across its entire length in 1956. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, Barton Highway was declared a National Highway in 1974, and was consequently re-allocated National Highway 25. With both states&#x27; conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, its route number was updated to route A25.

===Murrumbateman bypass and staged duplication===
The Barton Highway passes through farmlands and the NSW town of Murrumbateman. In October 2001 the Australian Government announced that they would bypass the town to the east. A$20 million was set aside in the 2006 federal budget for planning and duplication costs associated with the bypass. The same year, the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association had named the Barton Highway as the worst highway on the Auslink National Network in New South Wales; accounting for three road fatalities annually. While of the highway are located in New South Wales (NSW), only of the NSW section are dual carriageway.

Various NSW and Federal governments have committed funding towards improvements to the Barton Highway, including a bypass east of Murrumbateman and a staged duplication to create of dual carriageways. Stage one of construction work has commenced and is scheduled to be completed by 2023.

<text>Yass ()
is a town on the periphery of the Southern Tablelands and South West Slopes of New South Wales, Australia. The name appears to have been derived from an Aboriginal word, &quot;Yarrh&quot; (or &quot;Yharr&quot;), said to mean &#x27;running water&#x27;.

Yass is located 280 km south-west of Sydney, on the Hume Highway, and is 59 km from Canberra. It lies at an elevation of 505 metres. The Yass River, which is a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River, flows through the town.

Yass has a historic high street, with well-preserved 19th-century verandah post pubs (mostly converted to other uses). It is popular with tourists, some from Canberra and others taking a break from the Hume Highway.

== History ==
=== Aboriginal overview ===
The area around Yass was occupied by the Ngunawal tribe. They knew the area as &quot;yarrh&quot;, which means &quot;running water.&quot; The final &quot;rr&quot; sound was spelled in English with a double-S, apparently after being misheard as such due to its &quot;sharp and forcible&quot; quality.

=== Colonial overview ===
The Yass area was first seen by Europeans in 1821, during an expedition led by Hamilton Hume. By 1830, settlement had begun where the nascent Sydney to Melbourne road crossed the Yass River. The site for the town was gazetted in 1837. Yass was incorporated as a District Council in 1843, and boasted a population of 274 by 1848. On 13 March 1873, the Municipal District of Yass was created, and James Cottrell was subsequently elected as the first Mayor of Yass.

One of Australia&#x27;s best-known poets, A.B. &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson, arrived in the district in 1871 at the age of seven, passed his childhood there, and later bought a property in the Wee Jasper area so that his children could experience country life. Poet and priest Patrick Hartigan (pen name: John O&#x27;Brien) was born near Yass in 1878, and studied at the local convent school as a youth.

Sir Walter Merriman established &#x27;Merryville&#x27;, one of the country&#x27;s most famous sheep studs, and arguably its leading fine-wool establishment, in 1903. Yass is a prominent area for raising sheep which produces very fine wool due to the soil and climatic conditions.

Yass was one of the sites proposed for the Federal Capital after 1901, before Canberra was ultimately chosen. The proposed site would have been slightly west of the township of Yass, which would have been included in the surrounding federal territory.

In 1956, Yass became the first town in New South Wales to have a fluoridated water supply. The Hume Highway passed through the town until a bypass opened in July 1994.

=== Flour milling ===

It has never been explained why Yass was the home to a number of flour mills, especially as the district is well known for the production of fine merino fleece. Linge notes that many flour mills were set up for the personal convenience of settlers rather than commercial operations (Linge 1979:108); it may be that the mills were set up to grind locally produced grain for largely domestic consumption.

Bayley in his history of Yass records that, in March 1842, it was reported that the Yass Steam Mill was in operation (1973:24). This mill was located by the Yass River and was owned by the partnership of Hamilton Hume and John Watson. The mill was known as Watson&#x27;s Mill, and it seems to have operated until it was destroyed in a flood in 1870. At that time, it was owned by Thomas Andrew Barber (Ames et al. 2001:9).

Barber was the son of the George Barber (who, with Hume, first explored Yass) and was also Hume&#x27;s nephew. These connections no doubt lead to the choice of the site of Barber&#x27;s next mill as the land was originally owned by Hume. Barber constructed a new steam mill and, by May 1870, steam was raised and the mill itself opened in June 1870 (Bayley 1973:46). According to Armes &quot;et al.&quot;, the Barber family &quot;occupied surviving housing on the corner of Comur and Adele Street&quot; (2003:9). This mill, it is argued, is the existing brick structure known as &quot;Crago&#x27;s Flour Mill&quot;. The mill was operated by Barber until 1876, when he handed over his business interests to his sons Earnest and John, who traded under the name Barber Brothers.

Meanwhile, another steam mill – the Union Steam Mill – had been established, and by 1881, was owned by Petherick Tamblyn Crago. In around 1881 Crago purchased a site for a new mill between the White Horse Inn and Barber&#x27;s Mill. The mill was called the Commercial Mill and from newspaper reports was operating from 1882. According to Ralph Crago (letter 1970), the decision to erect the new mill was because the machinery in the old Mill (presumably the Union Steam Mill) was worn out.

The Barbers declared bankruptcy in October 1889, and in December 1889 there was a meeting in Yass to discuss the mill. The meeting was told that the machinery was 50 years old, the foundations of the mill were 4 feet deep and that a new mill would take 12 months to construct while the existing mill could be made operational in the New Year. The mill recommenced trading in January 1891.

A notable event occurred in 1892 when Yass was finally connected to the New South Wales Government Railways&#x27; Main Southern railway line. However, by the time the tramway reached the mills Barber&#x27;s Mill was only operating intermittently. It is not clear from newspaper reports, but it seems Barber tried to sell the mill in 1895, but was unsuccessful and eventually the mill was purchased from an Ann Ross by Arthur Bryant Triggs, a prominent local businessman, in September 1897. Triggs began rebuilding the old Barber&#x27;s mill, presumably as a roller mill. He also arranged for a siding to be constructed from Yass Station across Lead Street to the mill. Triggs opened the &quot;new&quot; mill in March 1898, but later that year in August sold the mill to Crago. This is the mill now standing in Yass.

According to information from Ralph Crago (letters written in 1955 and 1970) &quot;Around – once more it is only a guess - the turn of the century or early in the new one – the stones [in the Commercial Mill] were replaced by steel rollers by a firm called Henry Simon &amp; Co &amp; the steam power was replaced by suction gas made from charcoal. We bought a lot of our charcoal from the Jerrawa area when small farmers added to their income &amp; trucked it by rail to Yass.&quot; and &quot;The Crago Brothers were very proud of winning a bronze medal at the Wembley Exhibition in the early 1900s for flour made at Yass&quot;.

In the aerial photograph of the site of the two mills taken in 1927 the chimneys of both mills have been removed suggesting that their steam engines were non-operational from at least that time. However, the Commercial Mill continued working until 1953. Ralph Crago, who was manager from 1947 onwards, noted that the Mill bought wheat locally but also from the surrounding district and harder wheat from the Gunnedah district was imported to blend with the softer &quot;southern&quot; wheat. All this wheat was bagged wheat but in 1953 the Wheat Board decided to cease the use of bagged wheat. Faced with the cost of erecting bulk handling facilities, the Crago family sold the Commercial Mill to the stock and station agents Winchombe Carson.

Winchombe Carson demolished the Commercial Mill in 1953 and erected a number of buildings on the site which were in turn demolished in July 2009, during which time remains of the Commercial Mill were excavated by an archaeological team.

A freezing works were established by Winchombe Carson at the site of Barber&#x27;s Mill and numerous galvanised iron buildings were erected mainly to store bagged wheat for the Commercial Mill. After the Commercial Mill was demolished the Crago Mill (as Barber&#x27;s Mill is now known) was used for storage and remains the only surviving above-ground remains of the four Flour Mills in Yass.

Both the standing mill building - Crago Mill and the archaeological remains of the Commercial Mill - were listed on the Register of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in March 2014.

=== Railways ===
Yass was a battleground between the town and the Sydney to Melbourne railway; because of the topography, the New South Wales Government Railways wanted to bypass the town by a few kilometres. Naturally, the people of the town wished the railway to pass closer or through it. In 1892 a light railway or tram was built to connect Yass Junction on the main line and Yass Town. The railway bridge across the Yass River was the first lightweight, steel Pratt-truss bridge in the NSW railway network.

The last trains operated on the line on 29 October 1988 when steam locomotives 1210 and 3112 operated three final journeys on the line.

The Yass Railway Heritage Centre uses the Yass Town station precinct as a museum. Yass had the nearest railway station on the Sydney Melbourne railway to serve the national capital at Canberra.

When the uniform gauge railway between Sydney and Melbourne opened in 1961, the parliamentarian deserving most of the credit - William Charles Wentworth - was unable to leave parliament since his vote was needed in an almost hung parliament. Instead of catching the inaugural train at Sydney, he had to catch it at Yass Junction, where it made a special stop.

== Heritage ==

=== Heritage listings ===
Yass has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 101 Comur Street: Yass Post Office
* Main Southern railway: Yass Junction railway station
* Yass Town Tramway: Yass Town rail bridge over Yass River
* Yass Town Tramway: Yass Town railway station
* Yass Valley Way, Marchmont: Cooma Cottage

==== Cooma Cottage ====
Cooma Cottage is one of the oldest surviving rural houses in New South Wales. It has historic significance as a relatively intact complex of rural buildings and links to explorer and grazier Hamilton Hume. It is listed on the NSW Heritage register and is managed by the National Trust (NSW).

==== St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Church ====

St Augustine&#x27;s Parish Yass began in 1838 with the laying of the foundation stone of the church now called the chapel.

A striking modernist new building (the &#x27;big&#x27; church) was begun in 1954 under the eye of the then Bishop Young, later Archbishop of Hobart. The architect for the church was architects Fowell Mansfield and Maclurcan of Sydney. The builder was James Wallace of 123 Sussex Street, Sydney.

There are important works of art by renowned Australian sculptor Tom Bass in the Church:
* the crucifix on the outside
* the crucifix on the rear doors
* the statue of St Paul and
* the recently installed low-relief of St Augustine near the front door.

The foundation stone of the new church was laid on 11 April 1954 by Archbishop Eris O&#x27;Brien and the church was opened on 29 April 1956, by Archbishop Guilford Young.

Fifty-year celebrations were organised on 29 April 2006 by Father Laurie Bent, who was Parish Priest in Yass at the time.

==== Yass &amp; District Museum ====
The Yass &amp; District Museum represents Yass from the 1820s. Exhibitions pay tribute to the life and work of explorer and grazier Hamilton Hume, Yass soldiers and nurses who served in 20th-century wars, the Inns of Yass, Burrinjuck Dam; and illustrate a 19th-century shop, parlour and kitchen, rural life and work in a woolshed.

== Climate ==
The climate in Yass is intermediate between the Southern Tablelands and South West Slopes, having characteristics of both zones. Compared to Goulburn, it has a wider seasonal range and notably wetter winters relative to other seasons, though not quite to the extent as those of Bookham. Yass has a relatively dry climate owing to its rainshadow from the southwest (being east of Conroys Gap), however is exposed to the west and northwest. Snow falls occasionally but is usually light and rarely settles, though heavy snowfalls do occur on the hills to the southwest (around Wee Jasper).

== In popular culture ==
In 2018, the town was featured in &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, a Netflix original series. The town was chosen as its name matches one of the cast&#x27;s favourite sayings: yaass.

Yass is also famous for a humorous billboard for the town&#x27;s McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, shows the McDonald&#x27;s logo and the town&#x27;s name (making it read &quot;M YASS, opens at 6 AM&quot;. similar to &quot;my ass&quot;).

In the modern novel &quot;An Indecent Obsession &quot; by Colleen McCullough, Yass it&#x27;s the residence of the main character Honour Langhtry, the heroine of the story.

<text>Little England beyond Wales is a name that has been applied to an area of southern Pembrokeshire and southwestern Carmarthenshire in Wales, which has been English in language and culture for many centuries despite its remoteness from England. Its origins may lie in the Irish, Norse, Norman, Flemish and Saxon settlement that took place in this area more than in other areas of South West Wales. Its northern boundary is known as the Landsker Line.

A number of writers and scholars, ancient and modern, have discussed how and when this difference came about, and why it should persist, with no clear explanation coming to the fore.

==Etymology==
The language boundary between this region and the area to the north where Welsh is more commonly spoken, sometimes known as the Landsker Line, is noted for its sharpness and resilience. Although it is probably much older, the first known approximation of &quot;Little England beyond Wales&quot; was in the 16th century, when William Camden called the area .

==History==
Between 350 and 400, an Irish tribe known as the Déisi settled in the region known to the Romans as &quot;Demetae&quot;. The Déisi merged with the local Welsh, with the regional name underlying &quot;Demetae&quot; evolving into Dyfed (410–920), which existed as an independent petty kingdom. The area became part of the kingdom of Deheubarth (920–1197), but it is unclear when it became distinguished from other parts of Wales. Welsh scholar Dr B. G. Charles surveyed the evidence for early non-Welsh settlements in the area. The Norse raided in the 9th and 10th centuries, and some may have settled, as they did in Gwynedd further north. There are scattered Scandinavian placenames in the area, mostly in the Hundred of Roose, north and west of the River Cleddau. The medieval Welsh chronicle &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; mentions many battles in southwest Wales and sackings of Menevia (St David&#x27;s) in the pre-Norman period. Sometimes these were stated to be conflicts with Saxons, sometimes with people of unspecified origin. The Saxons influenced the language. John Trevisa, writing in 1387, said: 

===Norman period===
Early documentary evidence of Flemish immigration from England, rather than directly from Flanders, is given by contemporary William of Malmesbury (1095–1143), who wrote: The fact that they came via England, and that at that time the Flemish language was not markedly different from English, was likely to have influenced the English language becoming, and remaining, the dominant language of the area.

Another contemporary writer, Caradoc of Llancarfan (fl. 1135), was more explicit: 

A second batch of Flemings were sent to southwest Wales by King Henry in about 1113. According to &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; he: 

Unsurprisingly, then, the Flemish language did not survive in the local dialect. Ranulf Higdon in his &quot;Polychronicon&quot; (1327) stated that Flemish was by his time extinct in southwest Wales, and George Owen in 1603 was adamant that Flemish was long extinct.

===Post-Norman period===
In 1155, under the orders of the new King Henry II, a third wave of Flemings were sent to Rhys ap Gruffydd&#x27;s West Wales territories.

Gerald of Wales (c.1146-c.1223) and &quot;Brut y Tywysogyon&quot; recorded that &quot;Flemings&quot; were settled in south Pembrokeshire soon after the Norman invasion of Wales in the early 12th century. Gerald says this took place specifically in Roose. The Flemish were noted for their skill in the construction of castles, which were built throughout the Norman territories in Pembrokeshire. The previous inhabitants were said to have &quot;lost their land&quot;, but this could mean either a total expulsion of the existing population, or merely a replacement of the land-owning class. The development of Haverfordwest as the castle and borough controlling Roose dates from this period; this plantation occurred under the auspices of the Norman invaders. The Normans placed the whole of southwest Wales under military control, establishing castles over the entire area, as far north as Cardigan.

What followed, starting with the reign of Edward I in the late 13th century, was 100 years of peace, particularly in &quot;Little England&quot;, marked by the Edwardian conquest of Wales, which must have compounded the tendency of Welsh to become a minor language in the region. With the failure of Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s revolt in the early 15th century, in which no fighting took place in &quot;little England&quot;, came punitive laws affecting Wales, though these were, for reasons historians have not been able to ascertain, applied less rigorously here than elsewhere in Wales.

National awareness of the region was made much of in the 15th century with the birth of Henry Tudor at Pembroke Castle and his eventual accession to the English throne after beginning his campaign in southwest Wales. At the end of the Tudor period, George Owen produced his &quot;Description of Penbrokshire&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;), completed in 1603. The work is essentially a geographical analysis of the languages in the county, and his writings provide the vital source for all subsequent commentators. He is the first to emphasize the sharpness of the linguistic boundary. He said: 

Of Little England, he added: 

Owen described the linguistic frontier in some detail, and his 1603 line is shown on the map. His description indicates that some northern parts had been re-colonised by Welsh speakers. The disruptions of the post-Black Death period may account for this.

===Modern period===

Although Little England is described by several later writers (other than Edward Laws), they do little but quote Owen. Richard Fenton in his &quot;Historical Tour&quot; of 1810 observed that churches in the south of the county were more likely to have spires than those in the north. Quantitative descriptions of the linguistic geography of the area start with that of Ernst Georg Ravenstein, around 1870. This shows a further shrinkage since Owen&#x27;s time. From 1891 onward, linguistic affiliation in Wales has been assessed in the census. The overall picture is that the boundary has moved to a significant, but small degree. Furthermore, the boundary has always been described as sharp. In 1972, Brian John said of the linguistic boundary that it &quot;is a cultural feature of surprising tenacity; it is quite as discernible, and only a little less strong, than the divide of four centuries ago.&quot;

Aspects of the South Pembrokeshire dialect were noted from a talk at the British Library given by Marloes inhabitants in 1976; their dialect showed distinctive similarities to the English spoken in the West Country of England, as opposed to the English spoken in south east Wales.

Prior to the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, which resulted in the creation of the National Assembly for Wales (now the Senedd), it was reported that Pembrokeshire&#x27;s vote could be key.

The differences in the proportion of Welsh speakers persist, illustrated by the map derived from the 2011 census, and the name has persisted into the 21st century; in 2015 Tenby was quoted as being &quot;traditionally the heart of Little England beyond Wales&quot;. 

In 2022, the ice cream maker Upton Farm, based at Pembroke Dock, was criticised for using the phrase &quot;Made for you in little England beyond Wales&quot; in their packaging. The company agreed to remove the reference in future, and replace it &quot;with messaging that more clearly celebrates our Welshness&quot;.

==Overview==

As for placenames, the greatest concentration of Anglo-Saxon names is in the former hundred of Roose, which had pre-Norman origins, while there are considerable numbers of Welsh placenames in the rest of Little England, although these areas were certainly English-speaking. Flemish names, Fenton noted, are rarely found in early documents, supporting Owen&#x27;s statement: 

but that: 

Fenton adds: 

On the Gower Peninsula, the sharp distinction between the English- and Welsh-speaking populations has been referred to as the &quot;Englishry&quot; and the &quot;Welshry&quot;. As mentioned by Owen, the cultural differences between Little England and the &quot;Welshry&quot; extend beyond language. Manorial villages are more common in Little England, particularly on the banks of the Daugleddau estuary, while the north has characteristically Welsh scattered settlements. Forms of agriculture are also distinct.

On the other hand, Little England and the Welshry have many similarities. Typical Welsh surnames of patronymic origin (e.g. Edwards, Richards, Phillips etc.) were almost universal in the Welshry in Owen&#x27;s time, but they also accounted for 40 per cent of names in Little England. According to John, the majority of English-speaking Little England natives today regard themselves as Welsh, as did Gerald, who was born on the south coast at Manorbier in 1146.

Most recently, David Austin labels &quot;Little England&quot; a myth and questions the process by which the language came about, attributing it to a combination of land manipulation and Tudor &quot;aspirant gentry&quot;.

==Genetic studies==
Welsh academic Morgan Watkin claimed that levels of type A blood in South Pembrokeshire were 5–10 per cent higher than in surrounding areas. Watkin suggested that this was due to Viking settlement in the area, rather than the forcible transfer of a colony of Flemish refugees to the area, by King Henry I, in the early 12th century. However, the geneticist Brian Sykes later commented that – while the levels of blood group A in the Low Countries were not particularly high – it was not possible to tell whether the high levels in &quot;Little England&quot; were caused &quot;by rampaging Vikings or by a few cartloads of Belgians&quot;. Sykes also commented that, based on the findings of his &quot;Oxford Genetic Atlas Project&quot;, there was a lack of patrilineal Y-chromosomes from the &quot;Sigurd&quot; clan (haplogroup R1a) in South Wales in general, which was strong evidence against Viking settlement, and meant that Watkin&#x27;s theory regarding the high frequency of type A blood in &quot;Little England&quot; was wrong.

A 2003 Y-chromosome study in Haverfordwest revealed an Anglo-Celtic population similar to populations in South West England.

Researchers at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics reported in 2015 &quot;unexpectedly stark differences between inhabitants in the north and south of the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire&quot; in DNA signatures.

<doc id="614064" wikidata="Q472368" url="?curid=614064" title="The Songs of Distant Earth">
<text>The Songs of Distant Earth is a 1986 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, based upon his 1958 short story of the same title. Of all of his novels, Clarke stated that this was his favourite. Prior to the publishing of the novel, Clarke also wrote a short step outline with the same title, published in &quot;Omni&quot; magazine and anthologised in &quot;The Sentinel&quot; in 1983.

The story is set in the 39th century and depicts the journey of the spaceship &quot;Magellan&quot; as it carries a large group of colonists in suspended animation to a distant planet after Earth&#x27;s sun goes nova. En route, it has to stop for repairs at the planet Thalassa, which was colonised 700 years earlier but the colonists there lost contact with Earth for the past couple of centuries. The story delves into the cultural and emotional impact of the distant Earth’s demise on both sets of colonists, and how humans from two different worlds and societies interact with each other.

The novel explores apocalyptic, atheistic, and utopian ideas, as well as the effects of long-term interstellar travel, high technology, and extra-terrestrial life. Additional themes include human survival, adaptation, and the challenges of starting anew on an alien world.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the early 3800s and takes place almost entirely on the faraway oceanic planet of Thalassa. Thalassa has a relatively small human population, now in the tens of thousands, sent there by way of an embryonic seed pod centuries earlier. This was one of many such colonization missions sent from Earth in an attempt to continue the human race in the centuries before the Earth was destroyed.

The story begins with an introduction of the Thalassans – the marine biologist Brant, his partner Mirissa and her brother Kumar. They are typical examples of the Thalassan culture; quiet, stable, and free from religion and supernatural influence. Their peaceful existence is changed with the arrival of the &quot;Magellan&quot;, an interstellar spaceship from Earth containing almost a million colonists who have been put into cryonic suspension for a five century-long voyage to the planet Sagan Two, which they aim to terraform and colonize.

In a series of descriptive passages, the events leading up to the race to save the human species are explained. Scientists in the 1960s discover that the neutrino emissions from the Sun – a result of the nuclear reactions that fuel the star – are far diminished from expected levels. At a secret session of the International Astronomical Union it is confirmed that the Sun will become a nova around the year AD 3600.

Over the centuries, humanity develops advanced technologies to send out seeding ships containing human and other mammalian embryos (and later on, simply stored DNA sequences), along with robot parents, to planets that are considered habitable. One such ship is sent to the far-off ocean world of Thalassa and successfully establishes a small human colony there in the year 3109. Sending live humans, even ones placed into cryogenic hibernation, was deemed unfeasible at that time due to the immense amount of fuel that a rocket-propelled spacecraft, large and fast enough to carry thousands of humans to the stars in a reasonable amount of time, would have to use. However, this limitation is eventually overcome with the development of the &quot;Quantum Drive&quot;an engine that taps the bottomless well of zero point energyless than a hundred years before the Sun is set to become a nova. This breakthrough allows for the construction of a fleet of massive, crewed interstellar vehicles, including the &quot;Magellan&quot;, whose crew witnesses the detonation of the Sun and the destruction of Earth only three years after launch.

In the intervening years, the colony on Thalassa loses contact with Earth due to the destruction of its communication abilities by a volcanic eruption 400 years after its founding. The giant radio dish is never repaired due to an ingrained tendency among the Thalassans to procrastinate. The Thalassans are therefore unaware of later developments on Earth, including crewed interstellar travel. Earth assumes the colony was either destroyed, or reverted to barbarism, due to the loss of contact.

More than 200 years after the end of Earth, the &quot;Magellan&quot; arrives at Thalassa, approaching the midpoint of its voyage to Sagan Two. Primarily, the objective is to replenish the ship&#x27;s mammoth ice shield that had prevented micrometeors from damaging it during its interstellar journey. Thalassa is the obvious choice for this operation, as 95% of the planet&#x27;s surface is covered by water. However, it soon becomes apparent that the human colony there is still present and flourishing. Aboard the &quot;Magellan&quot;, several crew members are awakened by the ship to undertake the mission, while most of the 900,000 sleeping passengers remain in hibernation. Among the crew is Loren Lorenson, a young engineer, and Moses Kaldor, an eminent statesman.

The arrival of the visitors from Earth is a monumental event for the easygoing Thalassans, who never expected to see or hear from any other human beings. To the crew of the &quot;Magellan&quot;, it is a welcome surprise to meet the natives and sample the pleasures of a beautiful and hospitable planet. A tale of love and tragedy starts to develop as Loren and Mirissa quickly fall in love, a situation that demonstrates the different level of social mores between the two cultures. The Thalassans appear free from monogamy and sexual possessiveness, a situation that the lonely and troubled crew quickly find out.

Due to this and other aspects of the Thalassans&#x27; way of life, and the duration of the stay on the planet to repair the ship&#x27;s ice shield, a small contingent of the &quot;Magellan&quot; crew quickly becomes disenchanted with the original objective of their mission to Sagan 2, leading to a threat of mutiny.

A more gentle and parental relationship also develops between Mirissa and Moses, a man deeply affected by the destruction of Earth and the loss of his wife. Moses soon provides Mirissa an insight into the culture and ways of Earth lost to the Thalassans, including the concepts of war and religion, both alien to Mirissa and her people.

During the course of the stay, and due to the construction of a massive plant for freezing the huge ice blocks for the shield, the Terrans and the Thalassans become aware of the existence of potentially intelligent sea creatures living in the depths of the Thalassan oceans. The &quot;scorps&quot; are similar to the sea scorpions of Earth, only much larger. It soon becomes evident that the scorps are responsible for the theft of metals and wire from several Thalassan underwater projects, including a fish trapping tool being developed by Brant. The intelligence of these creatures is questioned by most, but Moses believes they may have the potential for developing into a future intelligent species.

Several unforeseen events occur that shatter the dream of idyllic life on Thalassa, and also remind the &quot;Magellan&quot; crew that they must soon continue their prime mission, and leave the Thalassans to their own destiny.

The story concludes with an air of tragedy and hope, as the relationship between Mirissa and Loren ends; the transient nature and ultimate futility of their love revealed. Mirissa chooses to conceive a child by Loren, but a change in scheduling of the mission brought about by the threat of mutiny by the crew means he will never see his son. Brant accepts the child as his own.

The dissatisfied elements of the &quot;Magellan&quot; crew are left to live on Thalassa as they requested, a development which in itself may now change Thalassan culture forever. The &quot;Magellan&quot; departs, and three centuries later finally arrives at Sagan Two. Loren views the numerous messages and video logs sent from Thalassa while he was in hibernation and witnesses the lives of Mirissa and his child, both long dead.

==Scientific aspects==
The novel explores one possible outcome of the solar neutrino problem, which was unsolved when Clarke wrote the work but has since been explained. There seemed to be a lack of neutrinos reaching the Earth from the Sun, because scientists were only looking for one particular state of the neutrino particle.

In the &#x27;Acknowledgements&#x27; section of the book, Clarke explains why he chose vacuum energy for spacecraft propulsion – speculated as scientifically viable, but highly futuristic technology.

The novel also features a space elevator, a concept that Clarke has used in previous works (most prominently in his 1979 novel &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;). 

In his introduction to the novel, Clarke states that he wished the work to deal with a realistic interstellar voyage, without the use of warp drives or other fantastic faster-than-light technologies that provide near-instantaneous interstellar travel in which light years are traversed in days, hours, or even minutes (such as in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchises) as opposed to years, decades or centuries. Despite the exotic nature of its quantum drive, the starship &quot;Magellan&quot; takes 212 years to travel the 50 light years to Thalassa.

==Setting==
In the story, there are 10 known colonies of Earth, most of which have lost contact with Earth. Several planets are mentioned by name: 
*Earth is the Mother world to the human race, destroyed over 200 years prior to the story due to the Sun going nova. The &quot;Magellan&quot; was the last colony ship to leave before the sun exploded. The word &quot;Earth&quot; is hard for the people of Thalassa to say due to its loss.
*Thalassa is the world on which most of the story takes place. 50 light years from Earth, it is an ocean world with three volcanic islands, and its own aquatic biota. The planet was colonised by a seed ship in the year 3109. The protagonists live on the southern of the three inhabited islands, and based on the limited physical descriptions and their names, they appear to be of mixed ethnic background.
*Pasadena is a planet in orbit around Alpha Centauri A, just over 4 light years from Earth. Although Earth has lost contact with the colony there, it may still be thriving.
*Sagan Two is the destination of the star ship &quot;Magellan&quot;, located 75 light years from Thalassa. The &quot;Magellan&quot; finally reaches Sagan Two in the year 4135. It is an untouched but Mars-like icy planet, larger than Earth, with about forty percent ocean and a mean temperature of twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit. Named for science communicator Carl Sagan, it has a pure nitrogen atmosphere that is terraformed by the &quot;Magellan&quot;&#x27;s crew after arrival.
*Sirius X is a colony of Earth mentioned in the story.

==Adaptations==
No screen adaptations of the novel have been made, though the original 1958 short story was adapted as a radio play by the BBC in 1962, directed by Charles Parr and produced by John Gibson. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Paul Ferris opined that it was &quot;better than the average space fiction&quot; and it contained a &quot;shuddery juxtaposition of complicated technology and simple fear.&quot;

==Cross-media influences==
Multi-instrumentalist and composer Mike Oldfield wrote an entire album based on – and entitled – &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot;, which was released in 1994. The album has a foreword written by Clarke. Oldfield included a CD-ROM multi-media interactive exploration animation software on some of the locations from the book, including the &quot;Hibernaculum&quot;. The album has been re-released in a package with the original short story, the movie outline and the CD-ROM.

The ending song and final chapter of &quot;Muv-Luv Unlimited&quot; are both named after &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot;, following the theme of every chapter having been named after a relevant or semi-relevant sci-fi story.

The final part of 1987 science fiction anime Space Fantasia 2001 Nights is named &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; received a positive review from Gerald Jonas in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Jonas praised its scope and its exploration of philosophical dilemmas: &quot;The drama that interests Mr. Clarke is played out on a much larger canvas. It concerns the lures and limitations of knowledge, the destiny of mankind, and the fate of the universe.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #81, and stated that &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, Clarke&#x27;s characters can only manage three emotions: intellectual hunger, sorrow for bygone glories (here a nova-zapped Earth), and awe in the face of the infinite. None is appropriate to a bittersweet love affair; with this vacuum at the book&#x27;s core, the other bits don&#x27;t fuse together but just lie there. Pity.&quot;

<text>Happy Isles is a group of small isles in the Merced River in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. They are located at the easternmost end of the Yosemite Valley floor. This scenic spot is the starting point for the Mist Trail, and is also the northern trailhead for the John Muir Trail. Happy Isles is also the trailhead for popular hiking destinations along the Mist Trail (including Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls) and Half Dome.

Happy Isles is located where the slope of the Merced River changes from the much steeper upper main stem to the essentially flat Valley floor. At Happy Isles, the river gradient is approximately 2%. The gradient of the Merced River at Happy Isles is steeper than in the Valley floor, and the channel of the river is cut into erosion-resistant granitic boulders and talus materials, compared to channel deposits of sands and gravel present on the Valley floor. The steeper gradient and composition of streambed materials together impede meandering patterns from developing in this area.

The area near Happy Isles sustained damage in 1996 during a rockslide. A number of signposts near the Isles are dedicated to the rockfall.

It is sometimes known as the [[Barcoo River]] from one of its tributaries and is one of three major Queensland river systems that flow into the Lake Eyre basin. The flow of the creek depends on monsoonal rains falling months earlier and many hundreds of kilometres away in eastern Queensland. It is in length.

==History==

Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the area for over 20,000 years, with over 25 tribal groups living in the Channel Country area alone. A vast trade network had been established running from north to south, with goods such as ochre sent north, while shells and pituri moved south. Birdsville was once a major meeting place for conducting ceremonies and trade.

Charles Sturt named the river in 1845 after Charles Cooper, the Chief Justice of South Australia. It was along Cooper Creek that the explorers Burke and Wills died in 1861. John King survived the expedition with the assistance of friendly Aboriginal people. Only ten years after the explorers&#x27; deaths, homesteads were being established on the watercourse. A station at Innamincka was the first permanent settlement in the area.

By 1880 the reliable water source had attracted more settlers to the point where the whole area was taken up and stocked with cattle. This led to the displacement of local people from their traditional lands. By 1900 the population had reduced to 30 survivors, just 10% of the original number, as influenza and measles took their toll.

The waterway does not experience regular seasonal floods. Being ephemeral the creek is still prone to occasional flooding, in 1940 a vast area surrounding the Cooper was underwater with the creek being measured at over wide in places.

==Course==
It rises west of the Great Dividing Range on low ground as two central Queensland rivers, the Thomson between Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area east of Tambo. This is believed to be the only instance in the world where two rivers flow into a creek.

Cooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of anastomosing ephemeral channels, making its way roughly south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning due west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. In most years, it is absorbed into the earth, goes to fill channels and the many permanent waterholes and lakes such as Lake Yamma Yamma, or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre.

In very wet years, however, it manages to flood the entire Channel Country and reaches Lake Eyre after flowing through the dry areas of Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and the Tirari Desert. Studies have clearly shown that, although with a mean annual flow of around (ranging at Barcoo from an estimated in 1902 to an estimated in 1950) the Cooper carries twice as much runoff as the Diamantina and three times as much as the Georgina, over the past ten thousand years it has reached Lake Eyre much less frequently than those rivers. This is because much more water is absorbed along its course than with the Diamantina or Georgina, but may also be because of centennial or multicentennial wet and dry cycles in those basins causing them to regularly reach the lake during wet periods (there is some evidence from terraces around Lake Eyre that this occurred during the Medieval Warm Period). During a flooding event the river upstream of Windorah may be as wide as .

==Land use==
Most of the basin of the Cooper is used for sheep and cattle grazing on natural grasslands: although the extreme east of the basin is relatively wet with averages of over 500 mm (20 inches) at Blackall, the rainfall is much too erratic for cropping. The soils are mainly Vertisols or Vertic Torrifluvents and are quite fertile, though generally heavy in texture with a strong tendency to crack due to the erratic rainfall.

<doc id="614077" wikidata="Q3307228" url="?curid=614077" title="Days of the New">
<text>Days of the New was an American rock band from Charlestown, Indiana, formed in 1995. The band later relocated to Louisville, Kentucky. They consisted of vocalist/guitarist Travis Meeks and a variety of supporting musicians. They are best known for the hit singles &quot;Touch, Peel and Stand&quot;, &quot;The Down Town&quot;, &quot;Shelf in the Room&quot;, and &quot;Enemy&quot;, as well as radio hits &quot;Weapon and the Wound&quot;, &quot;Hang On To This&quot; and &quot;Die Born&quot;. &quot;Touch, Peel and Stand&quot; was named, ″Greatest of All-Time Mainstream Rock Song″ by Billboard Magazine.

The band was formed by Meeks as an acoustic solo project during his teenage years. Their debut album, &quot;Days of the New&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Yellow&quot; or &quot;Orange&quot; album, was released in 1997 and featured Meeks, along with Jesse Vest, Todd Whitener and Matt Taul. Vest, Whitener and Taul went on to form Tantric. The group briefly included future pop star and Pussycat Dolls frontwoman Nicole Scherzinger on their 1999 album, also named &quot;Days of the New&quot;, but informally known as the &quot;Green&quot; album to distinguish it from the first album. Other band members would include drummer Ray Rizzo, bassist Mike Starr (Alice in Chains) and bassist Charlie Colin (Train). The group&#x27;s third album was also called &quot;Days of the New&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Red&quot; album, released in 2001.

==History==

===Early years===
Days of the New began as an experimental rock/groove metal trio called Dead Reckoning, with Meeks, Matt Taul, and Jesse Vest. When they turned to an acoustic sound, they changed the name of the band and added guitarist Todd Whitener.

A demo version of the song &quot;Freak&quot; appeared on the &quot;Harvest Showcase Volume 3&quot;, a compilation of Louisville area artists. This recording features a solo performance by Meeks credited to Days of the New. Jesse Vest and Mat Taul are listed as band members in the liner notes although they do not appear on this recording.

Producer Scott Litt, known for working with R.E.M and Nirvana, signed the band to his label Outpost Recordings, a joint venture with Geffen Records.

===1996–1998===
The band recorded their first album, &quot;Days of the New&quot;, at Allen Martin Productions in Louisville, Kentucky, in October and November 1996. The first Days of the New release, frequently called &quot;Orange&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; after the color of the disc and liner notes, was released in 1997, selling 1.5 million copies worldwide. Three songs from this album were hits: &quot;Touch, Peel and Stand,&quot; &quot;The Down Town,&quot; and &quot;Shelf in the Room.&quot; The first was No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Rock Chart for 17 weeks; &quot;The Down Town&quot; and &quot;Shelf in the Room&quot; were each top 40 hits.

The band contributed the song &quot;Running Knees&quot; to &quot;&quot;.

Internal problems of the band were evident early on. Shortly after releasing their debut album, Days of the New began touring smaller venues. MTV reported that, after missing a Florida concert in April, the band members appeared physically black-eyed and beaten the following day after what sources claimed to be a band brawl. They then toured with Metallica and Jerry Cantrell starting in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 24, 1998. Meeks later criticized this billing, arguing due to their acoustic sound, Days of the New should have toured with a group like Dave Matthews Band.

Just before starting this summer tour, however, Meeks had already told interviewers that all of his fellow band members were holding him back and, consequently, were being released from the group. He also said that they were disappointed by this decision but that he thought they would remain friends. An Outpost spokesperson, however, claimed that &quot;Travis just talks&quot; and that nothing was official. Before they could fulfill club touring duties with Finger Eleven and Flight 16 in December, without citing reason, Meeks canceled in early November. Various explanations were given by band members and a label spokesperson including poor tour scheduling, band fighting, and even Meeks being physically ill. It was finally confirmed in February 1999 that the band indeed split up. Todd Whitener, Mat Taul, and Jesse Vest would go on to form C14, soon renamed Tantric, while Meeks formed a new band under the Days of the New name.

There are two contradictory explanations of the original Days of the New breakup. Comments by Meeks in 1998 led to reports that he fired the rest of the band. Meeks has called this telling false and claims the other band members were jealous that he was paid more than they were. When Meeks first announced the news, he said &quot;It&#x27;s like a journey in the wilderness – you know with like the struggle and stuff. I made it through, I survived, but the other guys didn&#x27;t.&quot; He also posted comments online: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t truly a band format. It is my fault for leading you on and setting you up to get attached to the prior members.&quot; Later, in 2002, Meeks called in to &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and was asked by Stern why he did not stick with the original members. He replied, &quot;They had no spirituality. They had no brains.&quot; When Stern pointed out, &quot;They had hits!&quot; he gave the vague response, &quot;That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m into. I&#x27;m into the truth.&quot;

===1999–2001===
Shortly after the original band&#x27;s breakup, Meeks recorded a second album, &quot;Days of the New&quot;, informally referred to as the Green album to distinguish it from the group&#x27;s first album with the same title. The Green album was released on August 31, 1999. Meeks debuted his new band on September 4, 1999, at the ear X-tacy store in Louisville. Critics were fairly enthusiastic about the album but it sold poorly compared to the previous effort.

In February 2000, Meeks returned to the studio with a new band and recorded his third album as Days of the New, completing it by July. Like the previous two albums, it was titled &quot;Days of the New&quot;, but called the Red album by the media. The first single, &quot;Hang on to This&quot; peaked at No. 18 on the US Rock Chart and was the most added song on rock radio the week of its debut. The album, released two weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks with very little promotion, sold 90,000 copies. Days of the New toured with Creed and 3 Doors Down. Meanwhile, Meeks&#x27;s original bandmates formed the band Tantric, whose debut album Tantric went platinum.

===2002–present===
After touring for &quot;Red,&quot; the band parted ways with Interscope and had a period of inactivity. In December 2002, Meeks was involved in a high-profile audition for Velvet Revolver with several former members of Guns N&#x27; Roses. In the later half of 2003, Meeks embarked on a solo tour, performing at small venues. In January 2004, Days of the New split with Interscope Records over creative differences. His addiction to methamphetamine continued and in early 2005, he appeared on A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Intervention&quot;, where family and friends convinced him to enter rehab.

In September 2005, Meeks announced he had achieved sobriety and was writing for a fourth Days of the New record.

On March 4, 2008, Geffen released &quot;Days of the New: The Definitive Collection&quot;, the first compilation of the band. Meeks stated that the upcoming record will be called &quot;Days of the New Presents Tree Colors&quot;.

In 2010, Mike Starr of Alice in Chains began playing with Meeks, preparing for a tour that would also feature Charlie Colin of Train. However, Starr died on March 8, 2011, before touring had begun.

In 2014, the original lineup of Days of the New announced they had reunited and were planning a summer tour called &quot;Full Circle.&quot;
On May 30, 2014, Days of the New announced plans to release an EP with new material that fall.

Following a cancelled date in Columbia, Missouri, the band abruptly ended their set in St. Louis on September 6 due to Meeks being too drunk to perform. Bassist Jesse Vest took the microphone to inform the crowd that it was the band&#x27;s last show together. In the next several days, the band released several statements on Facebook claiming they&#x27;d reunited with Meeks because, after he&#x27;d unsuccessfully tried to recruit other musicians, he&#x27;d begged them to return.

On September 26, 2014, the band announced on Facebook that they again would be going their separate ways with Meeks retaining the Days of the New name. Meeks put a new lineup together and continued touring but was arrested in Portland, Maine on October 10, 2014, on a warrant for failure to appear in court to answer charges of possessing a hypodermic needle.

In April 2017, Meeks had been released from jail and was posting on social media.

In August 2018, after a four-year hiatus, Meeks played a solo show at the Red Bicycle Hall in Madison, Indiana.

On March 3, 2021, an unofficial bootleg compilation of some of Days of the New&#x27;s rarer tracks, entitled &#x27;The Gift&#x27;, was released illegally without the consent of the band or previous record label. 911 Entertainment Records have since confirmed this was wrong and pulled the release from all streaming platforms, effective immediately. 911 Entertainment Records issued an apology and pulled the bootleg album from streaming services. However, shortly after on July 26, 2021, 911 Entertainment Records released a revised version of the compilation, removing and adding several songs, titled &#x27;Illusion is Now&#x27;.

<doc id="614080" wikidata="Q3117700" url="?curid=614080" title="Thompson sporadic group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Thompson group &quot;Th&quot; is a sporadic simple group of order
:   90,745,943,887,872,000
: = 2153105372131931
: ≈ 9.

==History==
&quot;Th&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by and constructed by . They constructed it as the automorphism group of a certain lattice in the 248-dimensional Lie algebra of E8. It does not preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice, but does preserve the Lie bracket mod 3, so is a subgroup of the Chevalley group E8(3). The subgroup preserving the Lie bracket (over the integers) is a maximal subgroup of the Thompson group called the Dempwolff group (which unlike the Thompson group is a subgroup of the compact Lie group E8).

==Representations==

The centralizer of an element of order 3 of type 3C in the Monster group is a product of the Thompson group and a group of order 3, as a result of which the Thompson group acts on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 3 elements. This vertex operator algebra contains the E8 Lie algebra over F3, giving the embedding of &quot;Th&quot; into E8(3).

The full normalizer of a 3C element in the Monster group is S3 × Th, so Th centralizes 3 involutions alongside the 3-cycle. These involutions are centralized by the Baby monster group, which therefore contains Th as a subgroup.

The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group of the Thompson group are both trivial.

==Generalized monstrous moonshine==

Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. 
For &quot;Th&quot;, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is formula_1 (),

:formula_2

and &quot;j&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is the j-invariant.

==Maximal subgroups ==
 found the 16 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;Th&quot; as follows:

<doc id="614081" wikidata="Q630413" url="?curid=614081" title="Jean de Labadie">
<text>Jean de Labadie (13 February 1610 – 13 February 1674) was a 17th-century French Pietist. Originally a Jesuit priest, he became a member of the Reformed Church in 1650, before founding the community which became known as the Labadists in 1669. At its height the movement numbered around 600 with thousands of adherents further afield. It attracted some notable female converts such as the famed poet and scholar, Anna Maria van Schurman, and the entomological artist
Maria Merian.

Labadie combined the influences of Jansenism, Precicianism, and Reformed Pietism, developing a form of radical Christianity with an emphasis upon holiness and Christian communal living. Labadie&#x27;s teachings gained hold in the Netherlands.

==Life==
The son of an officer, he entered the Jesuit Order in 1625, was ordained in 1635, but left in 1639 due to poor health and tensions with the other brothers. He then worked as a diocesan priest in Bordeaux, Paris and Amiens. He turned to Jansenism and intensive study of the Bible, and began to be drawn to Calvinism. He regarded himself as divinely inspired. Cardinal Mazarin had him transferred to southern France in 1646 as a disturber of the peace, where he changed his allegiance to the Reformed Church in 1650 at Montauban.

He served as a pastor and professor of theology at Montauban from 1652 to 1657. In 1659 he was pastor in Geneva, where he gathered around him disciples notably; Pierre Yvon Pierre Dulignon, François Menuret, and Friedrich Theodor Untereyck Spanheim.

In 1666 he was appointed preacher at Middelburg in the Netherlands, but in 1669 was dismissed for his theological views. He then founded a house church in Amsterdam which served as a model for later foundations, but which was persecuted. He moved on, in 1670, with his pupil Anna Maria van Schurman and his congregation into a house in Herford, Germany, provided as a refuge for persecuted spiritualists by Elisabeth of the Palatinate, the Calvinist abbess of the Lutheran convent in that city.
Here, too, he was pressed and harassed, and in 1672 he left and walked to Altona, Duchy of Holstein. Labadie died in 1674 in that German city which belonged then to the Danish crown. The movement continued both in Europe and America, but had dissipated by 1732.

==Works==
Labadie&#x27;s most influential writing was &quot;The Reform of the Church Through the Pastorate&quot; (1667).

<text>Petrus de Dacia ( – 1289) was a 13th-century Swedish friar of the Dominican Order. 
He was most noted for his correspondence with the mystic and ecstatic Christina von Stommeln. Though he wrote in Latin, Petrus de Dacia is often credited as the first author in Sweden.

==Biography==
Petrus de Dacia was born around 1235 on the Swedish island of Gotland. He entered the Dominican order and studied in Cologne from 1266 to 1269 and in Paris from 1269 to 1270. In 1271 he was appointed lector in the convent at Skänninge in Östergötland. In 1283 he became Prior of Sankt Nicolaus abbey church in Gotland where he died in 1288.

While at Cologne, he had met Christina von Stommeln (1242–1312). Christina lived around Stommeln near Cologne and had entered the convent of the Beguines at Cologne. Over a period of two decades, she reportedly received stigmata on an annual basis. Petrus visited Christine in 1270 on his way back from Paris and again in 1279. He also maintained a lifetime correspondence with her.

<doc id="614085" wikidata="Q1292017" url="?curid=614085" title="Good manufacturing practice">
<text>Current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) are those conforming to the guidelines recommended by relevant agencies. Those agencies control the authorization and licensing of the manufacture and sale of food and beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, dietary supplements, and medical devices. These guidelines provide minimum requirements that a manufacturer must meet to assure that their products are consistently high in quality, from batch to batch, for their intended use.

The rules that govern each industry may differ significantly; however, the main purpose of GMP is always to prevent harm from occurring to the end user. Additional tenets include ensuring the end product is free from contamination, that it is consistent in its manufacture, that its manufacture has been well documented, that personnel are well trained, and that the product has been checked for quality more than just at the end phase. GMP is typically ensured through the effective use of a quality management system (QMS).

Good manufacturing practice, along with good agricultural practice, good laboratory practice and good clinical practice, are overseen by regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, various European countries, China, India and other countries.

==High-level details==
Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance in order to ensure that a manufactured product is safe for human consumption or use. Many countries have legislated that manufacturers follow GMP procedures and create their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation.

All guidelines follow a few basic principles:

* Manufacturing facilities must maintain a clean and hygienic manufacturing area.
* Manufacturing facilities must maintain controlled environmental conditions in order to prevent cross-contamination from adulterants and allergens that may render the product unsafe for human consumption or use.
* Manufacturing processes must be clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications.
* Manufacturing processes must be controlled, and any changes to the process must be evaluated. Changes that affect the quality of the drug are validated as necessary.
* Instructions and procedures must be written in clear and unambiguous language using good documentation practices.
* Operators must be trained to carry out and document procedures. 
* Records must be made, manually or electronically, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the food or drug was as expected. Deviations must be investigated and documented.
* Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced must be retained in a comprehensible and accessible form.
* Any distribution of products must minimize any risk to their quality.
* A system must be in place for recalling any batch from sale or supply.
* Complaints about marketed products must be examined, the causes of quality defects must be investigated, and appropriate measures must be taken with respect to the defective products and to prevent recurrence.

Good manufacturing practice is recommended with the goal of safeguarding the health of consumers and patients as well as producing quality products. In the United States, a food or drug may be deemed &quot;adulterated&quot; if it has passed all of the specifications tests but is found to be manufactured in a facility or condition which violates or does not comply with current good manufacturing guideline.

GMP standards are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products. They are a series of performance based requirements that must be met during manufacturing. When a company is setting up its quality program and manufacturing process, there may be many ways it can fulfill GMP requirements. It is the company&#x27;s responsibility to determine the most effective and efficient quality process that both meets business and regulatory needs.

Regulatory agencies have recently begun to look at more fundamental quality metrics of manufacturers than just compliance with basic GMP regulations. US-FDA has found that manufacturers who have implemented quality metrics programs gain a deeper insight into employee behaviors that impact product quality.

In its Guidance for Industry &quot;Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP&quot; US-FDA states “it is the role of management with executive responsibility to create a quality culture where employees understand that data integrity is an organizational core value and employees are encouraged to identify and promptly report data integrity issues.” Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration has said that recent data integrity failures have raised questions about the role of quality culture in driving behaviors. In addition, non-governmental organizations such as the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE) and the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA) have developed information and resources to help pharmaceutical companies better understand why quality culture is important and how to assess the current situation within a site or organization.

== Guideline versions ==
GMP is enforced in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under Title 21 CFR. The regulations use the phrase &quot;current good manufacturing practices&quot; (CGMP) to describe these guidelines. Courts may theoretically hold that a product is adulterated even if there is no specific regulatory requirement that was violated as long as the process was not performed according to industry standards. However, since June 2007, a different set of CGMP requirements have applied to all manufacturers of dietary supplements, with additional supporting guidance issued in 2010. Additionally, in the U.S., medical device manufacturers must follow what are called &quot;quality system regulations&quot; which are deliberately harmonized with ISO requirements, not necessarily CGMPs.

The World Health Organization (WHO) version of GMP is used by pharmaceutical regulators and the pharmaceutical industry in over 100 countries worldwide, primarily in the developing world. The European Union&#x27;s GMP (EU GMP) enforces similar requirements to WHO GMP, as does the FDA&#x27;s version in the US. Similar GMPs are used in other countries, with Australia, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Philippines], Vietnam and others having highly developed/sophisticated GMP requirements. In the United Kingdom, the Medicines Act (1968) covers most aspects of GMP in what is commonly referred to as &quot;The Orange Guide,&quot; which is named so because of the color of its cover; it is officially known as &quot;Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors&quot;.

Since the 1999 publication of &quot;Good Manufacturing Practice for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients&quot;, by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), GMPs now apply in those countries and trade groupings that are signatories to ICH (the EU, Japan and the U.S.), and applies in other countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, Singapore) which adopt ICH guidelines for the manufacture and testing of active raw materials.

== Enforcement ==
Within the European Union GMP inspections are performed by National Regulatory Agencies. GMP inspections are performed in Canada by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate; in the United Kingdom by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA); in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS); in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA); in Bangladesh by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA); in South Africa by the Medicines Control Council (MCC); in Brazil by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA); in India by state Food and Drugs Administrations (FDA), reporting to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization; in Pakistan by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan; in Nigeria by NAFDAC; and by similar national organizations worldwide. Each of the inspectorates carries out routine GMP inspections to ensure that drug products are produced safely and correctly. Additionally, many countries perform pre-approval inspections (PAI) for GMP compliance prior to the approval of a new drug for marketing.

== CGMP inspections ==
Regulatory agencies (including the FDA in the U.S. and regulatory agencies in many European nations) are authorized to conduct unannounced inspections, though some are scheduled. FDA routine domestic inspections are usually unannounced, but must be conducted according to 704(a) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 USCS § 374), which requires that they are performed at a &quot;reasonable time&quot;. Courts have held that any time the firm is open for business is a reasonable time for an inspection.

== Other good practices ==
Other good-practice systems, along the same lines as GMP, exist:
* Good agricultural practice (GAP), for farming and ranching 
* Good clinical practice (GCP), for hospitals and clinicians conducting clinical studies on new drugs in humans
* Good distribution practice (GDP) deals with the guidelines for the proper distribution of medicinal products for human use.
* Good laboratory practice (GLP), for laboratories conducting non-clinical studies (toxicology and pharmacology studies in animals)
* Good pharmacovigilance practice (GVP), for the safety of produced drugs
* Good regulatory practice (GRP), for the management of regulatory commitments, procedures and documentation

Collectively, these and other good-practice requirements are referred to as &quot;GxP&quot; requirements, all of which follow similar philosophies. Other examples include good guidance practice and good tissue practice.

<doc id="614094" wikidata="Q1756025" url="?curid=614094" title="Replay attack">
<text>A replay attack (also known as a repeat attack or playback attack) is a form of network attack in which valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and re-transmits it, possibly as part of a spoofing attack by IP packet substitution. This is one of the lower-tier versions of a man-in-the-middle attack. Replay attacks are usually passive in nature.

Another way of describing such an attack is:
&quot;an attack on a security protocol using a replay of messages from a different context into the intended (or original and expected) context, thereby fooling the honest participant(s) into thinking they have successfully completed the protocol run.&quot;

==Example==

Suppose Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob. Bob requests her password as proof of identity, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation like hashing, or even salting, the password); meanwhile, Eve is eavesdropping on the conversation and keeps the password (or the hash). After the interchange is over, Eve (acting as Alice) connects to Bob; when asked for proof of identity, Eve sends Alice&#x27;s password (or hash) read from the last session which Bob accepts, thus granting Eve access.

==Prevention and countermeasures==
Replay attacks can be prevented by tagging each encrypted component with a session ID and a component number. This combination of solutions does not use anything that is interdependent on one another. Due to the fact that there is no interdependency, there are fewer vulnerabilities. This works because a unique, random session ID is created for each run of the program; thus, a previous run becomes more difficult to replicate. In this case, an attacker would be unable to perform the replay because on a new run the session ID would have changed.

Session IDs, also known as session tokens, are one mechanism that can be used to help avoid replay attacks. The way of generating a session ID works as follows.

# Bob sends a one-time token to Alice, which Alice uses to transform the password and send the result to Bob. For example, she would use the token to compute a hash function of the session token and append it to the password to be used.
# On his side Bob performs the same computation with the session token.
# If and only if both Alice’s and Bob’s values match, the login is successful.
# Now suppose an attacker Eve has captured this value and tries to use it on another session. Bob would send a different session token, and when Eve replies with her captured value it will be different from Bob&#x27;s computation so he will know it is not Alice.

Session tokens should be chosen by a random process (usually, pseudorandom processes are used). Otherwise, Eve may be able to pose as Bob, presenting some predicted future token, and convince Alice to use that token in her transformation. Eve can then replay her reply at a later time (when the previously predicted token is actually presented by Bob), and Bob will accept the authentication. 

One-time passwords are similar to session tokens in that the password expires after it has been used or after a very short amount of time. They can be used to authenticate individual transactions in addition to sessions. These can also be used during the authentication process to help establish trust between the two parties that are communicating with each other.

Bob can also send nonces but should then include a message authentication code (MAC), which Alice should check.

Timestamping is another way of preventing a replay attack. Synchronization should be achieved using a secure protocol. For example, Bob periodically broadcasts the time on his clock together with a MAC. When Alice wants to send Bob a message, she includes her best estimate of the time on his clock in her message, which is also authenticated. Bob only accepts messages for which the timestamp is within a reasonable tolerance. Timestamps are also implemented during mutual authentication, when both Bob and Alice authenticate each other with unique session IDs, in order to prevent the replay attacks. The advantages of this scheme are that Bob does not need to generate (pseudo-) random numbers and that Alice doesn&#x27;t need to ask Bob for a random number. In networks that are unidirectional or near unidirectional, it can be an advantage. The trade-off being that replay attacks, if they are performed quickly enough, i.e. within that &#x27;reasonable&#x27; limit, could succeed.

===Kerberos protocol prevention=== 
The Kerberos authentication protocol includes some countermeasures. In the classic case of a replay attack, a message is captured by an adversary and then replayed at a later date in order to produce an effect. For example, if a banking scheme were to be vulnerable to this attack, a message which results in the transfer of funds could be replayed over and over to transfer more funds than originally intended. However, the Kerberos protocol, as implemented in Microsoft Windows Active Directory, includes the use of a scheme involving time stamps to severely limit the effectiveness of replay attacks. Messages which are past the &quot;time to live (TTL)&quot; are considered old and are discarded.

There have been improvements proposed, including the use of a triple password scheme. These three passwords are used with the authentication server, ticket-granting server, and TGS. These servers use the passwords to encrypt messages with secret keys between the different servers. The encryption that is provided by these three keys help aid in preventing replay attacks.

===Secure routing in ad hoc networks=== 
Wireless ad hoc networks are also susceptible to replay attacks. In this case, the authentication system can be improved and made stronger by extending the AODV protocol. This method of improving the security of Ad Hoc networks increases the security of the network with a small amount of overhead. If there were to be extensive overhead then the network would run the risk of becoming slower and its performance would decrease. By keeping a relatively low overhead, the network can maintain better performance while still improving the security.

=== Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol ===
Authentication and sign-on by clients using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) are susceptible to replay attacks when using Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) to validate their identity, as the authenticating client sends its username and password in &quot;normal text&quot;, and the authenticating server then sends its acknowledgment in response to this; an intercepting client is therefore, free to read transmitted data and impersonate each of the client and server to the other, as well as being able to then store client credentials for later impersonation to the server. Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) secures against this sort of replay attack during the authentication phase by instead using a &quot;challenge&quot; message from the authenticator that the client responds with a hash-computed value based on a shared secret (e.g. the client&#x27;s password), which the authenticator compares with its own calculation of the challenge and shared secret to authenticate the client. By relying on a shared secret that has not itself been transmitted, as well as other features such as authenticator-controlled repetition of challenges, and changing identifier and challenge values, CHAP provides limited protection against replay attacks.

==Real-world examples of replay attack susceptibility==

There are several real-world examples of how replay attacks have been used and how the issues were detected and fixed in order to prevent further attacks.

===Remote keyless-entry system for vehicles===
Many vehicles on the road use a remote keyless system, or key fob, for the convenience of the user. Modern systems are hardened against simple replay attacks but are vulnerable to buffered replay attacks. This attack is performed by placing a device that can receive and transmit radio waves within range of the target vehicle. The transmitter will attempt to jam any RF vehicle unlock signal while receiving it and placing it in a buffer for later use. Upon further attempts to unlock the vehicle, the transmitter will jam the new signal, buffer it, and playback an old one, creating a rolling buffer that is one step ahead of the vehicle. At a later time, the attacker may use this buffered code to unlock the vehicle.

===Text-dependent speaker verification===
Various devices use speaker recognition to verify the identity of a speaker. In text-dependent systems, an attacker can record the target individual’s speech that was correctly verified by the system, then play the recording again to be verified by the system. A counter-measure was devised using spectral bitmaps from the stored speech of verified users. Replayed speech has a different pattern in this scenario and will then be rejected by the system.

===Replay attacks on IoT devices===
In the realm of smart home environments, Internet of things (IoT) devices are increasingly vulnerable to replay attacks, where an adversary intercepts and replays legitimate communication signals between an IoT device and its companion app. These attacks can compromise a wide array of devices, including smart plugs, security cameras, and even household appliances.
A recent study demonstrated that a substantial portion of consumer IoT devices are prone to replay attacks. Researchers found that 75% of tested devices supporting local connectivity were vulnerable to such attacks. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to mimic legitimate commands, potentially enabling unauthorized actions such as turning on a smart kettle, unlocking doors, or manipulating security systems. Such breaches pose significant safety, security, and privacy risks, as malicious actors can gain control over critical home systems.

===In popular culture===
In the folk tale &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;, the thieves&#x27; captain used the passphrase &quot;Open, Sesame&quot; to open the door to their loot depot. This was overheard by Ali Baba, who later reused the passphrase to get access and collect as much of the loot as he could carry.

<text>Tacna, officially known as San Pedro de Tacna, is a city in southern Peru and the regional capital of the Tacna Region. A very commercially active city, it is located only north of the border with Arica y Parinacota Region from Chile, inland from the Pacific Ocean and in the valley of the Caplina River. It is Peru&#x27;s tenth most populous city.

The city has gained a reputation for its patriotism, with many monuments and streets named after heroes of Peru&#x27;s struggle for independence (1821–1824) and the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Residents of Tacna are known in Spanish as &quot;&quot;.

==History==

Francisco Antonio de Zela, a royal accountant (similar in function to a modern-day income tax auditor), initiated the push for Peruvian Independence from Spain in 1811 in Tacna, leading to a series of commemorative actions for the city, culminating in the 1828 declaration of Tacna as the &quot;Heroic City&quot; (&quot;&quot;) by President José de La Mar.

It was the capital of the short-lived Peru–Bolivian Confederation (1836–1839).

Tacna was known for its mining industry; it had significant deposits of sodium nitrate and other resources. Its economic prosperity attracted a wave of immigrants from Italy. Today, their Italian Peruvian descendants live in the city and many of them still have Italian surnames. This era of successful commerce and agriculture ended drastically with the start of the War of the Pacific. Hosting a large Peru-Bolivian army under poor sanitary conditions the city lost a substantial part of its population to infectious diseases before its capture by Chile in May 1880 following a defeat of the allied army in the outskirts of the city by a Chilean force under General Manuel Baquedano.

===Chilean administration===
During the war, the Tacna—as well as neighbouring Arica—was administered by the Chilean Army and incorporated as a commune that served as the seat of the eponymous department and province. In modern Peruvian historiography, this period is known as the . The Treaty of Ancón was signed in 1883 between Peru and Chile, ending the war. Under the terms of the treaty, Chile was to administer the provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years, taking control of valuable mineral deposits, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region&#x27;s sovereignty. But when the ten years had elapsed, the two sides could not agree whether to include a large number of imported Chilean laborers in the vote. Throughout the administration, Chilean groups and authorities led a campaign of Chilenization in an attempt to persuade the local population to abandon their Peruvian past and accept Chilean nationality. However, Peruvian nationalists ensured that the Chilean propaganda failed and the planned plebiscite was never held.

The commune was formally created through a decree on 22 December 1891, taking into account the limits assigned by the decrees of 9 November 1885 and 10 May 1886, and was composed of four subdelegations: &quot;El Callao&quot;, &quot;San Ramón&quot;, &quot;El Mercado&quot; and &quot;El Alto de Lima&quot;.
According to the 1907 census, the population that year was numbered at 10,593 people. During this period, people such as Jorge Basadre and Salvador Allende (as well as his family) lived in the city.

Starting in 1 February 1928, by virtue of Decree with Force of Law No. 8,583 published that 28 January under the government of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, the commune of Tacna was composed of three subdelegations: &quot;Intendencia&quot;, &quot;Comercio&quot; and &quot;Pocollay&quot;. This decree also ordered the creation of the communes of Palca and Sama, which together with Tacna formed a single municipal group; That is, neither Palca and Sama had their own communal government as in most communes in Chile.
In 1929, the Treaty of Lima was signed in which Chile kept Arica, whilst Peru reacquired Tacna and received a $6 million indemnity and other concessions. The commune ceased to exist when the treaty became effective on 28 August, in a ceremony held at the home of the prefect Federico Fernandini, in which an agreement was signed between the interim mayor of the Chilean province of Tacna, Gonzalo Robles, and a delegation of Peru headed by Foreign Minister Pedro José Rada y Gamio. At 4 p.m. that day, the Peruvian municipality of Tacna began its functions.

===History after 1929===
Today, Tacna is a mostly commercial city with many migrants from the Puno Region living there. Its economy is based on mercantile activities with the north of Chile (Arica and Iquique). Since it is part of a duty-free zone, Tacna has come to rival Arequipa as southern Peru&#x27;s main business area. The city has one of the largest artifact markets in the world with imports from Japan and China, and traditional Peruvian handicrafts.

==Geography==
The area is generally desert, with a few fertile spots near the mountains. Except for Caplina, no rivers cross the entire province.
===Climate===
Tacna has a desert climate (&quot;BWk/BWh&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification).

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Tacna was served by a cross-border railway to Arica, Chile. The line closed in 2012, but as of June 2014, there were plans to reopen it.

It is also the location of the National Railway Museum of Peru.

===Air===
Tacna is served by the Crnl. FAP. Carlos Ciriani Santa Rosa International Airport, with flights to Arequipa and Lima.

===Road===
Tacna is also served by Peru Highway 1 which heads south to Arica and north to Moquegua.

==Tourist attractions==

Many monuments are located in this city, including the arch of the Alto de la Alianza and the Tacna Parabolic Arch.

Other monuments include a neo-renaissance Cathedral, the Courthouse, the Alameda Bolognesi and the caves of Toquepala, where archaeologists have found some of the oldest human remains in Peru.

==Festivities==

The most important festivity in the city is the &quot;Semana de Tacna&quot; (&quot;Tacna Week&quot;), which runs from August 25–30.

On 28 August, a large Peruvian flag is shown throughout the city during the &quot;&quot;, which celebrates the anniversary of the reincorporation of Tacna into Peruvian sovereignty and is one of the most important patriotic demonstrations in the whole country. This tradition started in 1901, during the Chilean administration of Tacna, by a group of &quot;tacneños&quot; who defied the prohibition of showing Peruvian flags imposed by the Chilean authorities.

There is an agrarian and industrial fair as part of these celebrations.

In September, the festival of the Señor de Locumba is celebrated, which draws thousands of faithful people from all over the world.

<text>Bengt Gunnar Sigurd Linder (26 July 1929 in Härnösand - 17 April 1985 in Lidingö) was a Swedish writer and journalist. He wrote approximately 100 books for children and young adults, as well as text for revues and entertainment programs for radio and TV.

== Work ==
Linder wrote in a very colloquial style, and his books are characterised by rapid dialogue and a fast pace.

He also wrote the manuscripts for a few Swedish films, such as &quot;Kostervalsen&quot; from 1958 and &quot;Drömpojken&quot; from 1964. In 1978 he wrote the script for a film based on one of his own books from 1967, called &quot;Dante - akta&#x27;re för Hajen!&quot;. The movie was not well received by critics, who characterised it as incoherent and illogical.

<text>Llanvapley () is a village in the community of Gobion Fawr, in Monmouthshire, south east Wales, United Kingdom. &quot;Llan&quot; has replaced the (earlier) &quot;Eglwys&quot; (1254).
This village lies 4 miles north east of 2023’s Best Places to Live listed town, Abergavenny.

== Location ==
Llanvapley is located at .

Llanvapley is sited on the B4233 road, a popular route for cyclists, about four miles from Abergavenny and nine miles from Monmouth.

In standard Welsh the name of the parish is Llanfable. In the Gwentian dialect this was Llanfaple (a &quot;b&quot; at the beginning of a final syllable becomes &quot;p&quot;) (although one might expect Llanfapla, as by the 1800s a final &quot;e&quot; was pronounced as &quot;a&quot;). The form Llanvapley is the anglicised spelling of the Gwentian dialect form. A variant anglicised spelling - Llanfapley - preserves the Welsh &quot;f&quot; [v]. Curiously, this hybrid spelling is found in some Welsh-language texts in the 1800s. Both Llanvapley and Llanfable occur on ancient maps, documents and property deeds. The spelling Llanfapley is still used occasionally.

== Amenities ==

The Red Hart Inn, in the centre of the village, reopened in February 2020 after a substantial renovations and offers diverse menus and craft ales. Families are welcome and the large south facing pub garden to the rear has great views of the Llanvapley cricket ground and surrounding countryside. Extensive parking is available on site.

Llanvapley has an activecricket team and the modern cricket pavilion and village hall is run by the Llanvapley Sports &amp; Social Association and is also used as a polling station. The site includes an excellent children&#x27;s playground with tree seats and picnic benches. The Local Women&#x27;s Institute meets regularly, tai chi classes are often available together with the monthly meeting Llanvapley and District Gardening Club, and village afternoon teas are held on the first Monday afternoon of each month in the pavilion, amongst other activities. There is a walking group and village life is very active.

Church of St Mabli is of 15th century origin, ancient yet recently sympathetically renovated using natural materials sourced locally; services are held on the second and fourth Sundays of each month. The Rev. Heidi Prince was appointed as Priest-in-Charge in 2015, having been a highly popular Rector of Llanvapley between 1997 and 2006. She was the first woman to be appointed in six centuries of worship. The church has a strong congregation and is part of a group of local parishes including Llanvetherine, Llantilio Crossenny and Penrhos. The group has a parish magazine known as The New Times which is available to download on the group website Llantilio Group website.

Llanvapley Court is the largest property in the village and was in the past a country hotel and housed the Land Army during WWII. A number of historic Welsh longhouses of architectural note can be found within the curtilage of Llanvapley, as illustrated in the Historic Houses of Monmouthshire, by Lord Raglan.

The village has strong transport links, being about a 7 minute drive and 4 miles from Abergavenny railway station with direct trains to London, Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, Hereford, Crewe, Liverpool, Manchester and beyond.

Education provision locally is strong and free state school transport is provided by Monmouthshire County Council leaves the village at about 8am daily. The local state schools include the outstanding Monmouth Comprehensive School and Cross Ash Primary, Hereford Sixth Form College, and independent schools including Haberdashers&#x27; Monmouth Schools for boys and girls.

The village lies within the historic Three Castles area, a ten-minute drive of the historic castles of Raglan, White Castle, Skenfrith and Grosmont.

Excellent cinema is available 4 and 9 miles away, at The Baker St and Savoy cinemas respectively, the latter being the oldest working cinema in Wales.

Openreach provides super fast broadband throughout the village, averaging 70 megabytes per second and for that reason the village attracts many seeking to escape to the county whilst maintaining active careers.

<text>Onitsha ( or simply &quot;Ọ̀nị̀chà&quot;) is a city on the eastern bank of the Niger River, in Anambra State, Nigeria. Onitsha along with various cities and towns in southern Anambra State, northern Imo State and neighboring Delta State on the western bank of the Niger River, form a continuous metropolitan area.

As of 2016, the greater Onitsha area had an estimated population of around 8 million people in central and southern Anambra state extending into neighboring Delta state to the west and Imo state to the south. Spread across parts of these 3 states, the greater Onitsha area is regarded as one of the largest metropolitan areas in Nigeria by both population and landmass. The continuous urban sprawl or conurbation of greater Onitsha spreads across several separate cities and their satellite towns and suburbs including Asaba, Obosi, Ogbaru, Nnewi, the Anambra State capital Awka down to Orlu in Imo State. As of early 2024, Onitsha city proper has an estimated population of 1,695,000.

The indigenous people of Onitsha are Igbo and speak the Igbo language with Onitsha being the largest urban area and commercial hub of the Igboland region of Nigeria, the Igbo people’s indigenous homeland. The Onitsha people are referred to as Ndi Onicha in Igbo. English and Nigerian Pidgin English are also widely spoken. Although the population is largely Igbo, there are many other ethnic groups in the Onitsha area mainly from other Nigerian ethnicities indigenous to the southeast of the country due to Onitshas position as an economic hub in the region.

According to Africapolis, the greater Onitsha metropolis will be regarded as one of the most densely populated areas in the world by 2050. In 2023, McKinsey predicted that the greater Onitsha metropolis area will double in human development by 2045 with the current expansion rate.

== Modern history ==
Onitsha slowly grew to become an important trading port for the Royal Niger Company in the mid-1850s following the abolition of slavery and with the development of the steam engine when Europeans were able to move into the hinterland.

Trade in palm kernels, palm oil, and other cash crops on the coast of the Bight of Biafra increased around this river port in the 19th century.

In 1857 British palm oil traders established a permanent station in the city with Christian missionaries joining them.

In 1900 Onitsha became part of a British protectorate. The British colonial government and Christian missionaries penetrated most of Igboland to set up their administration, schools and churches through the river port at Onitsha.

In 1965, the Niger River Bridge was built across the Niger River to replace the ferry crossing. This has helped to grow trade routes with western Nigeria and created significant economic linkages between Onitsha and Benin City and Lagos particularly.

The Nigerian-Biafran war brought devastation to Onitsha as the city was a major theatre of war for forces entering Biafra from the western front. The subsequent oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s witnessed a huge influx of immigrants into the city. The result has been hastily constructed and haphazard building which has created a huge number of slums.

===Festival===
Once a year in October the kingdom of Onitsha holds the Ofala Festival which coincides with the traditional New Yam festival held in many parts of Igboland. The Ofala Festival in ancient times offered the people the opportunity to see the king and receive blessings from him. Nowadays, it is a way for the people of Onitsha to keep their culture alive, take stock of the communal activities and it has become a major event that draws visitors from far and wide to the city.

== Geography ==

Onitsha lies on the eastern flank of a major east–west crossing point of the Niger River across from the city of Asaba, Delta and occupies the northernmost point of the river regularly navigable by large vessels. It is the western terminus of the central &quot;Anambra hills&quot;. These factors have historically and in modern-day made Onitsha into major trading center between the coastal regions and the north, as well as between eastern and western Nigeria. Onitsha possesses one of the very few road bridge crossings of the mile-wide Niger River and plans are in place to add a second bridge southwards of the existing one.

Rapid urbanization in recent years although promoting the economy, negatively affects natural vegetation and local landscape. the region is also considerably erosion prone

== Climate ==
Onitsha has two main seasons: a warm, oppressive, and overcast wet (&quot;rainy&quot;) season from March to October, and a hot and partly cloudy dry season from November to February with both largely influenced by the SW and NE trade winds of the Atlantic International Convergence Zone (&quot;ITCZ&quot;). Saharan harmattan winds are experienced during the winter months, causing haze and poor visibility with thunderstorms common in March/April as well as in late September/October. Over the duration of the year, the temperature commonly varies from 19 °C (67 °)F to 31 °C (88 °F) and is rarely below 15 °C (59 °F) or above 33 °C (92 °F). The Köppen climate classification is &quot;Aw&quot;.

== Urbanization ==
In the early 1960s, before the Nigerian Civil War (see also Biafra), the population was officially recorded as 76,000, and the town was distinctive in a number of dimensions; the great Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe (born and raised in the contiguous town of Ogidi) characterized it as harboring an &quot;esoteric region from which creativity sallies forth at will to manifest itself,&quot; &quot;a zone of occult instability&quot; (see &quot;Onitsha Matters&quot;).

Indeed, Onitsha has played a creative role in the transformation to urban life in Eastern Nigeria famous as the setting for Onitsha Market Literature and as one of the hubs for the financing and distribution of Nollywood films.

However, infrastructure has not kept pace with urbanization and haphazard building practices without zoning regulations has left in its wake a chaotic and congested city rife with lawlessness. The World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution database&#x27;s 2016 update indicates that Onitsha is the most polluted city in Africa.

In recent times with the encroachment of neighboring communities, the Onitsha people have been involved in disputes over land ownership in the surrounding area with the people of Obosi and Nkwelle Ezunaka. Fegge, Awada, and 3-3 are Onitsha metropolitan areas being disputed by the communities of Obosi and Nkwelle Ezunaka, respectively.

== Economy ==
In 2012 the state government, through a joint venture, attracted SAB Miller to invest in Onitsha Brewery, which started production in August. It was the first large-scale investment in Onitsha since Premier Breweries, makers of the Premier Beer established production in Onitsha in the early part of the 1980s. In January it was announced that upgrades to the value of $110 million would triple the output of beer and malt drinks.

==Transport==
Onitsha is not only accessible by rivers and land, but also by air. The city has an international cargo and passenger airport located at Umueri.

== Religion and politics ==
Onitsha is a predominantly Christian city. People from Northern and Western Nigeria also practice Islam. In February 2006, armed militants killed at least 80 ethnic Hausa Fulani (Muslims) and burned a few Muslim sites, including two mosques. The riots were in response to riots by Muslims in the city of Maiduguri days earlier, where at least 18 Christians were killed, sparked by the cartoon controversy in Denmark.

==In Popular Culture==

===Onitsha Market Literature===

It refers to the 20th century genre of sentimental, moralistic novellas, pamphlets and other publications sold at the Onitsha Market in Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s. Much of it was written in pidgin English. The Onitsha writings have two distinct characteristics: a fascination with westernized urban life and the desire to warn the newly arrived against the corruption and dangers that accompany it. Typical titles are “Rose Only Loved My Money,” “Drunkards Believe Bar as Heaven,” “Why Some Rich Men Have No Trust in Some Girls,” and “How to Get a Lady in Love.” Sentimental novelettes, political tracts, and “how to” guides on writing love letters, handling money, and attaining prosperity all have achieved great commercial success, and booksellers hawk these cheap, locally produced pamphlets (which are printed on handpresses) at Onitsha.

== Environment==
The amount of waste generation is attributed to the city&#x27;s high population being a commercial area that draws in people from within and outside Nigeria for business purposes. They generate mostly food waste, polythene bags, paper and its related wastes and metal. Others are pieces of clothes, plastic, tins, bottles and glass materials. In 2016, PM10 levels exceeded the WHO&#x27;s standard by 30 times.
The city&#x27;s noise levels exceeds the federal ministry of environment stipulated limits of 90 dB (A) and that of NESREA&#x27;s 70 dB (A) for an 8-hour working period, varying in dry season and wet seasons. The city&#x27;s vast surface water, shallow subsurface water, and permeable soils put it at high risk of water pollution.

== Twin towns ==
Onitsha is twinned with:
* Compton, California, United States (2010)
* Indianapolis, Indiana, United States (2017)

== Notable people ==
The Onitsha people were among the first Igbo to embrace western education, producing notable people like Bishop Alphonsus Chukwuma Onyeabo, Order of the British Empire, 1879–1954, and the main contributor of the English to Igbo bible, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Owele of Onicha, Zik of Africa, and the first president of the post-independent Nigeria.

<text>Koprivshtitsa (, pronounced , from the Bulgarian word , &quot;kopriva&quot;, meaning &quot;nettle&quot;) is a historic town in the Koprivshtitsa Municipality in Sofia Province, central Bulgaria, lying on the Topolnitsa River among the Sredna Gora mountains.

<text>David Grubbs (born September 21, 1967) is an American composer, guitarist, pianist, and vocalist. He was a founding member of Squirrel Bait, Bastro, and Gastr del Sol. He has also played in Codeine, The Red Krayola, Bitch Magnet and The Wingdale Community Singers.

==Music career==
Grubbs&#x27; first band was a brief-lived punk/new wave group called The Happy Cadavers that released the four-song 7&quot; record &quot;With Illustrations&quot; in 1982. Grubbs then formed a hardcore punk band called Squirrelbait Youth that later evolved into the influential Louisville, Kentucky group Squirrel Bait, releasing a 12&quot; EP and an album on Homestead Records. Grubbs&#x27;s next group was the post-punk power trio Bastro, which released an EP and two albums on Homestead. In 1991 Bastro morphed into the more avant-garde Gastr del Sol. This project soon became essentially a partnership between Grubbs and Jim O&#x27;Rourke after the band&#x27;s first album. The albums released by the duo include &quot;Crookt, Crackt, or Fly&quot;, &quot;Upgrade &amp; Afterlife&quot;, and &quot;Camoufleur&quot;. In this period, Grubbs also contributed to other projects, including guitar for two tracks on Codeine&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;The White Birch&quot; and guitar, piano, and harmonium on recordings by Palace Music, Will Oldham, Royal Trux, Dirty Three, Matmos, Richard Buckner, Tony Conrad, Pauline Oliveros, Arnold Dreyblatt, and many others.

Since the breakup of Gastr del Sol in 1997, Grubbs has released numerous solo and collaborative records, mostly on the Drag City label, for which he co-directed the Dexter&#x27;s Cigar sub-label. In 2000, his album &quot;The Spectrum Between&quot; was named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;.

His 2017 album &quot;Creep Mission&quot; was described by The Quietus as &quot;a typically playful and intellectually ambitious set – and is as good an entry into the world of Grubbs as any.&quot;

In 2018, Grubbs released &quot;Failed Celestial Creatures&quot;, a collaboration with Japanese guitarist and electronic musician Taku Unami. According to Pitchfork, the album &quot;feels of a piece with Grubbs’ last two records under his own name, &quot;Creep Mission&quot; and &quot;Prismrose&quot;, both nominal solo releases that each features a handful of guests. On all three albums, Grubbs uses the presence of collaborators to play with drones, repetition, and improvisatory interplay, taking his style to a more intuitive place.&quot;

He operates his own label, Blue Chopsticks, which has released new and archival recordings from Luc Ferrari, Derek Bailey and Noël Akchoté, Workshop, Van Oehlen, and Mats Gustafsson. Grubbs is also known for his collaborations with writers Susan Howe, Rick Moody, and Kenneth Goldsmith, and with visual artists including Anthony McCall, Angela Bulloch, Stephen Prina, and Cosima von Bonin. He has composed the soundtracks for Angela Bulloch&#x27;s installations &quot;Z Point&quot;, &quot;Horizontal Technicolour&quot;, and &quot;Hybrid Song Box.4&quot;, and his music appears in two installations by Doug Aitken. Grubbs&#x27;s sound installation &quot;Between a Raven and a Writing Desk&quot; was included in the 1999 group exhibition &quot;Elysian Fields&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

Grubbs&#x27;s soundtrack work includes music with Matmos for Thierry Jousse&#x27;s feature film &quot;Invisible (Les Invisibles)&quot;. Grubbs has also contributed music to the Red Krayola&#x27;s soundtrack to Norman and Bruce Yonemoto&#x27;s film &quot;Japan in Paris in LA&quot; and to three films by Augusto Contento (&quot;Parallax Sounds&quot;, &quot;Strade Trasparenti&quot;, and &quot;Onibus&quot;), to Braden King and Laura Moya&#x27;s film &quot;Dutch Harbor: Where the Sea Breaks its Back&quot;, and to John Boskovich&#x27;s film &quot;North&quot;. Music by Gastr del Sol appears in the PBS television series &quot;The United States of Poetry&quot;, Hal Hartley&#x27;s film &quot;The Book of Life&quot;, and Doug Aitken&#x27;s film &quot;The Diamond Sea&quot;. Grubbs composed the score for Karl Bruckmaier&#x27;s radio adaptation of Peter Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Die Ästhetik des Widerstands&quot; (Hessischer Rundfunk Hörbuch des Jahres 2007) and contributed music to Bruckmaier&#x27;s adaptation of Alexander Kluge&#x27;s &quot;Chronik der Gefühle&quot; (Deutscher Hörbuchpreis 2010, &quot;Best Fiction&quot;).
From 1997 to 1999, Grubbs was a part-time instructor in the Liberal Arts and Sound departments at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is currently Professor of Music in the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College, CUNY. He teaches in Brooklyn College&#x27;s MFA program in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Brooklyn College&#x27;s MFA program in Creative Writing, and is a member of the faculty of the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music (BC-CCM).

He is one of five musicians (with Steve Albini, Ken Vandermark, Damon Locks, and Ian Williams) profiled in Augusto Contento&#x27;s 2012 documentary film &quot;Parallax Sounds&quot;.

==Academic career==
Grubbs received a B.A. degree from Georgetown University, an A.M. degree from the University of Chicago in 1991, and a Ph.D. degree in English, also from Chicago, in 2005.

Grubbs is Distinguished Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, specialised in sound art and experimental music, and teaching in performance arts, interactive art and creative writing. His criticism has appeared in &quot;Texte zur Kunst&quot;, &quot;Chicago Review&quot;, &quot;TDR&quot;, &quot;Conjunctions&quot;, &quot;Bookforum&quot;, and &quot;Purple&quot;, and from 1999-2007 he regularly contributed music criticism to the Munich newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;. Grubbs received a 2005–2006 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

Grubbs is the author of four books for Duke University Press: &quot;Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording&quot; (2014), &quot;Now that the audience is assembled&quot; (2018), &quot;The Voice in the Headphones&quot; (2020), and &quot;Good night the pleasure was ours&quot; (2022). &quot;Now that the audience is assembled&quot; was described by The Washington Post as &quot;a new book-length poem [that] reminds us that listening can feel stranger than dreaming.&quot; &quot;Records Ruin the Landscape&quot; has appeared in French, Italian, and Japanese translations. Grubbs is also the co-author of the collaborative artists’ books &quot;Simultaneous Soloists&quot; (with Anthony McCall, Pioneer Works Press, 2019) and &quot;Projectile&quot; (with Reto Geiser and John Sparagana, Drag City, 2021).

==History==

Maps and artifacts suggest that the area has been settled since the Gojoseon kingdom period.

During the Han dynasty (221 BC–220 AD), the Dandong region was under the jurisdiction of west Anping county. During the Goguryeo kingdom period, the region was the site for Bakjak Fortress. After the fall of the Goguryeo, in the early Tang dynasty (618–907), the Dandong region was under the jurisdiction of Andong Prefecture. In the 8th century, the area was conquered by King Mun of Balhae (r. 737–793). In Liao dynasty (916–1125), it was under the jurisdictions of the states Xuan, Kai, and Mu.

It fell under the jurisdiction of the state of Po-Su in the Jin dynasty, the state of Po-Sha in the Yuan dynasty, and the state of Liaodong in the Ming dynasty.

The area became known as Andong County () in 1876. &quot;&quot; means &quot;pacifying the east&quot;, reflecting the power that China had over Korea at the time. After the start of the first Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Andong County was occupied by Japan. During the Manchukuo era, it was the capital of Andong Province, one of the fourteen provinces established by Manchukuo. It was opened as an American treaty port in 1903. It was opened as a treaty port in 1907.

From November 1950 to February 1951, Dandong&#x27;s Sino–Korean Friendship Bridge was bombed by the United States during the Korean War, as was an older iron bridge leading to North Korea. Even though the Sino–Korean Friendship Bridge was rebuilt, the remains of the Japanese-built iron bridge were left and now serve as a war monument.

On 20 January 1965, the city adopted its present name of Dandong, which means &quot;red east,&quot; to avoid the connotations of its previous name, which was considered imperialistic by some. Recently, the city has been gaining influence in this region of China because of its market with North Korea and the government&#x27;s future plans to develop the city into a special &quot;Border Economic Cooperation Zone&quot; for export and import in order to expand the country&#x27;s ability to conduct trade.

In 2001, Dandong was granted the &quot;Best Tourist Destination City&quot; award by the National Tourism Administration. Four years later, the same administration granted it the award of &quot;National Clean City.&quot;

<text>The Bank of Crete (, ) was a bank that functioned between 1899 and 1918.

== History==
Following the departure of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s forces in December 1898, the government of the autonomous Cretan State, under Eleftherios Venizelos, established the Bank of Crete (&quot;Banque du Crète&quot;) with the assistance of the National Bank of Greece and Hambros Brothers on 30 September 1899. In addition to the functions of commercial and mortgage banking, the bank received the exclusive privilege, for thirty years, of issuing banknotes in the island of Crete. The National Bank of Greece wholly acquired, and subsumed the Bank of Crete in 1919.

<text>Anders Bircow (born 15 December 1951 in Helsinge) is a Danish actor and comedian. He is best known as a member of the comedy act Linie 3.

Anders Bircow was born in the town of Helsinge, and attended schools in Nærum, Ramløse and Helsinge. He received an education as a bank worker in Helsinge, and later worked as a school teacher in Vorgod in Herning. He received an education as an actor at Aarhus Theatre, and have had roles at most of the teatres in Copenhagen.

Bircow played guitar and bass in a band called Cokes from the age of 13 until adulthood. He joined Skuespillerskolen (Drama school) at the Århus city’s local theatre. In 1979 he formed the comedy group Linie 3 along with Preben Kristensen, with whom he had previously had the four-man group Barbershop Harmony, and Thomas Eje. Linie 3 premiered their first TV show in 1980.

In 2001 Linie 3 appeared in a millennium show called &quot;Rundrejsen 2001&quot; that was seen by more than 300,000 people. Linie 3 had their 25th anniversary-show in 2004. They then broke up for some years and Eje spent time in the US; they reformed in 2011. Their comeback show in April 2012 at the Tivoli Theatre in Copenhagen was a success and was followed by a nationwide tour.

Bircow has also appeared in his own one-man-show, mostly at company and private events. He has directed plays and translated drama and animated cartoons. He has voiced many cartoon characters and is the official voice of Mickey Mouse in Denmark.

In addition to acting and entertainment, he was the chief representative of Amway in Denmark for many years. He lodged a successful complaint against a newspaper which characterised this as investment in a pyramid scheme.

Bircow is married to Marion Bircow and has three daughters, Caroline, Julia and Sophia.

<doc id="614127" wikidata="Q7729060" url="?curid=614127" title="The Darling Buds of May (TV series)">
<text>The Darling Buds of May is a British comedy drama television series, produced by Yorkshire Television for the ITV network, first broadcast between 7 April 1991 and 4 April 1993. The first six episodes of Series 1 and the first two of Series 2 are adaptations of the 1958 novel of the same name, and three of its four sequels, by H. E. Bates. The remaining episodes are original storylines based on the same format.

Set in rural 1950s Kent, it follows the life of the Larkin family. It stars David Jason as &quot;Pop&quot; Larkin alongside Pam Ferris as &quot;Ma&quot; Larkin, with Catherine Zeta-Jones playing their eldest daughter Mariette, who marries tax inspector Cedric &quot;Charley&quot; Charlton, played by Philip Franks. A ratings success, it was Zeta-Jones&#x27;s breakthrough role.

Featuring a total of 20 episodes, it was broadcast as three series of six double-episode story lines in the spring of 1991, 1992 and 1993, plus two single-episode Christmas specials aired in 1991 and 1992.

The title is from the third line of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 18.

==Synopsis==

The Larkin family live on a smallholding in rural England, in the county of Kent. Sidney (&quot;Pop&quot;) and his common law wife Florence (&quot;Ma&quot;) have six children: eldest daughter Mariette, followed by their only son Montgomery, and other daughters Primrose, twins Zinnia and Petunia, and Victoria. Ma is a housewife while Pop supplements his farm income with various other, not entirely legitimate, enterprises. Tax collector Cedric (&quot;Charley&quot;) visits to audit Pop but falls in love with Mariette and quits his job to live the rural life. As Ma and Pop raise their other children, Charley attempts to provide for his now wife Mariette. Ma and Pop soon have a seventh child, Oscar, followed around a year later by Charley and Mariette&#x27;s first baby, John Blenheim.

Pop and Ma&#x27;s relationship is depicted as loving and affectionate throughout, although Pop is flirtatious and subject to numerous advances, most of which Ma is aware of and evidently unconcerned by. Proud of all his children, Pop&#x27;s schemes provide well for the family, enough to fund boarding school for the twins, naval boarding school for Monty, a swimming pool, a fairground, and a holiday to France, although he is just as motivated by doing good and helping others as making a profit. Ma occasionally becomes involved in Pop&#x27;s schemes, or creates a scheme of her own. Possessing some very close friends, their lifestyle, in particular the fact they have never been married, nonetheless raises eyebrows in the stuffy environs of the local village.

Mariette and Charley&#x27;s relationship is more torrid, in part due to his insecurity over Mariette being so attractive, and Charley&#x27;s varying success in providing financially, with their newly acquired hop garden struggling. Mariette&#x27;s business skills eventually come to bear as they purchase a local brewery. Primrose is depicted as a frustrated romantic, moving to France to live with a boy her own age and attempting to seduce both Charley and the village minister upon her return. Monty meanwhile contends with bullying, both at home and at naval boarding school. The increasingly mischievous twins gradually grow apart from their younger sibling Victoria, who delights in teasing and embarrassing all her siblings, especially Primrose.

==Period==
All the episodes are seemingly set during 1958–59, despite the timespan of events across all three series making this a logical impossibility. The first serial is based on the first book, written and set in 1958, during which Florence finds out she is pregnant. In the second serial (&quot;When the green woods laugh&quot;) Sidney is accused of committing indecent assault on 23 August 1958, with the trial taking place on the same day as Charley and Mariette&#x27;s wedding. The date of the trial is given as 7 July; this would seem to be a continuity error, because it cannot be July of the following year, as Florence&#x27;s baby had not yet been born. By the time of the third serial (&quot;A breath of French air&quot;), Florence has already given birth to Oscar, and the Larkins have a late-August holiday in Brittany, during which Charley and Mariette celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The fourth serial (&quot;Christmas is coming&quot;) is set at Christmas, and it is established Mariette is five months pregnant; she gives birth in the fifth serial (&quot;Oh! to be in England!&quot;), which would be some time in the spring of 1960 at the earliest, according to the dating of the first series and the chronology of events up to that point.

However, in the sixth serial (&quot;Stranger at the gates&quot;) the twins celebrate their birthday, which a close-up of a wall calendar reveals to be 15 August 1959. In the eighth serial (&quot;Le Grand Weekend&quot;), the Larkins&#x27; weekend getaway coincides with Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s state visit, which would date the events of the episode to April 1960, if it does indeed coincide with the real-life visit. Primrose&#x27;s birthday was revealed to be in May in &quot;Stranger at the gates&quot;, and she celebrates it in the ninth serial, &quot;The happiest days of your life&quot;, dating the events either to May 1960 (using the retconned second series date) or 1961 (going by the date given in the first series).

By the eleventh serial (&quot;Climb the greasy pole&quot;), when the children are older and the babies have grown to toddlerhood, another close-up of a calendar reveals the month to be October 1959. At the end of the final episode, Sidney is elected to the Rural District Council on 5 November 1959 (Guy Fawkes Night).

== Production ==

=== Conception and development ===
Having been sold to MGM films in 1959, it was not until 1989 that Richard Bates, son of the author of the original books H. E. Bates, was able to purchase the rights to the novels. At the same time, Yorkshire Television was looking for a new project for David Jason, who had starred for them in &quot;A Bit of a Do&quot;. Richard Bates went on to executive produce the show, alongside Vernon Lawrence of Yorkshire Television.

=== Casting ===
Bates had originally considered Bob Hoskins as ideal for the role of Pop, but Lawrence was of the view his increasing fame as a film actor would create problems. Jason was cast first, followed by Ferris and Franks. Finding an actor to fit with the novel&#x27;s description of Mariette as a black-haired and olive-skinned beauty proved difficult, with more than 300 hopefuls being rejected until Zeta-Jones was cast. With filming due to start, she had been spotted appearing in &quot;42nd Street&quot; at the Drury Lane theatre.

=== Filming ===
Each one-hour episode took two weeks to film, followed by two months in post production.

=== Filming locations ===

Much of the series was filmed in and around the village of Pluckley in Kent; executive producer Richard Bates lived just a few miles away.

The location for &quot;Home Farm&quot;, the Larkin residence, was Buss Farm, a few miles south of Pluckley, owned by the Holmes family. All four main buildings of the Grade II listed farm were utilised: the farmhouse itself, a square oast house (depicted in the title sequence), a Tudor barn and cart lodge. After being put up for sale by the family in 2012, it was purchased in 2013 by a businessman. It was renamed &quot;Darling Buds Farm&quot;, and several buildings were converted into guest accommodation themed around the show.
Other locations in Pluckley village itself were used extensively; the Black Horse pub in The Street was renamed the Hare and Hounds and used as the Larkins&#x27; local. Church Gate Cottage and Fig Tree Cottage in The Street served as Edith Pilchester&#x27;s and The Brigadier&#x27;s homes, respectively. Pluckley primary school, also in The Street, served as the village hall. The butcher&#x27;s shop also featured, and the Post Office (dressed as the grocer&#x27;s). Church scenes were filmed at St Nicholas Church in the village.

The cricket scenes were filmed at Little Chart Cricket Club, a village north east of Pluckley.
Further afield, in and around Tenterden, Kent, Halden Place in Halden Lane, Cranbrook, served as Mrs Kinthley&#x27;s hop garden, Wentwood Cottage in Swain Road served as Charley and Mariette&#x27;s cottage, and the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway was the location of Charley&#x27;s arrival in Kent, and the station used by Ma, Charley and Mariette shopping for her wedding dress. Other scenes shot in Kent included the Shepherd Neame Brewery in Faversham, and scenes of the Larkins&#x27; beach holiday, filmed in Folkestone, including a backdrop of the Leas Lift. Mlle. Dupont is met by the Larkins at Folkestone Harbour after her channel crossing.

Little filming was done inside the farmhouse, the interiors having been shot in a studio at Yorkshire Television. Scenes shot in the former Wennington School near Wetherby in Yorkshire, which stood in for Bluff Hall, were included. Other filming locations in Yorkshire include the Hotel Metropole in Leeds, which stood in for the &#x27;Marble Arch Hotel&#x27;.

To mark the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, Kent County Council established a tourist trail featuring the various film locations, other local attractions, and Kent food.

=== Music ===
The series&#x27; music producer Pip Burley wrote the title theme, &quot;Perfick!&quot;. He had submitted the piece anonymously, having deemed the submissions received from a shortlist of composers missed the point of the essential romanticism of the show. Although it also featured lyrics, drawn from the words used in the novels, the theme music for the series did not feature them. The song with lyrics was later sung by David Jason for the radio adaptation of the last book in the Larkin series, &quot;A Little of What You Fancy&quot;.

=== Future ===
In 2016, having filmed a cinema adaptation of another classic TV series, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, Zeta-Jones responded positively to suggestions that &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; might also be similarly remade, stating &quot;I&#x27;d be playing Ma Larkin, but I&#x27;m up for it&quot;. However, by 2020, any plans for a film were put on hold, with the &quot;Radio Times&quot; reporting that ITV was to remake the series, with Simon Nye writing the scripts and with Bradley Walsh and Joanna Scanlan in the cast. The series, with the title &quot;The Larkins&quot;, first aired in October 2021 starring Walsh and Scanlan, with Sabrina Bartlett and Peter Davison also amongst the cast.

== Themes ==
Locally produced food and drink intentionally played a core role in the series. Due to not being ripe at the right time, the strawberries used in the series were imported from Holland. One of the most iconic scenes features Pop and Ma eating a meal together whilst having a bath. With several scenes featuring eating, the fact Ferris was a vegetarian had to be worked around by the production staff. Both Ferris and Jason gained weight due to the amount of food they had to consume, often doing multiple takes for several scenes at one time, to make the scenes look realistic.

Another theme of the series was the Larkin family&#x27;s habit of giving their children unusual or themed first and middle names. Mariette was created by combining &#x27;Marie&#x27; and &#x27;Antoinette&#x27;. Montgomery was named after wartime officer Field Marshal Montgomery. Victoria was named for being born during the plum season (Victoria plum). While Monty and Victoria have no middle names, the other children have several: Primrose Violet Anemone Iris Magnolia Narcissa, twins Petunia June Florence Nightingale and Zinnia June Florence Nightingale, and Oscar Columbus Septimus Dupont, the last one being in tribute to the French hotelier Madamoiselle Dupont, who features in the series. Mariette and Charlie continue the family penchant for elaborate naming by christening their son John Marlborough Churchill Blenheim.

==Release==

=== Broadcast ===
The first episode was transmitted on the ITV channel at 8 o&#x27;clock on a Sunday night.

=== Home media ===
When the series was first released on video, it sold £1m worth of copies in the first four days.

DVD releases:

Note: The 2008 and 2011 DVD sets from ITV Studios list that there are 11 episodes; this is due to the fact that all episodes in series 1–3 (not including the specials) contain two parts, making them count as a whole.

=== Soundtrack ===
A 16-track soundtrack of the series was released by EMI on CD in 1991.

== Reception ==
The series was a ratings success, its &quot;feel-good&quot; factor during economic recession often noted as the reason. Whilst Yorkshire TV classified it as a drama, audiences and critics have generally considered it to be a comedy-drama.

The first episode broke a British broadcasting record, becoming the first instance of a new series topping the national ratings, beating the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (also an ITV production) on the night. This came as a shock to producers, although they had been hopeful of good ratings due to dull weather and the belief that people would be looking for something to lift their spirits following the end of the Gulf War.

Jason attributed the series&#x27; popularity to the public wanting a more wholesome, inclusive and inoffensive viewing option at a time when violence on television was increasing. This was one of the main reasons he decided to take the role.

The series generated an upsurge in sales of H. E. Bates&#x27;s novels.

=== Awards ===
* 1992 Ivor Novello Award – Best Theme from a TV/Radio Production

==Source novels and other adaptations==

The series is based on the works of H. E. Bates, who died in 1974. Having moved from the industrialised English Midlands to a granary in Little Chart in Kent in 1930 in search of new inspirations for his work, he was initially frustrated in his efforts to create a novel based on the Kent way of life. His inspiration for the Larkin stories eventually came in 1955 while on a trip to Sittingbourne. Pausing at Faversham, he observed the joyful camaraderie of a large boisterous family as they emerged from a shop and departed in a large blue truck. Combining this with observations of another family on a nearby small-holding, he set about writing about how these families might live. Originally a short story, he expanded it into a novel, followed by a further four books, the titles of the first four of which were used as episode titles for the TV series:

*&quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1958)
*&quot;A Breath of French Air&quot; (1959)
*&quot;When the Green Woods Laugh&quot; (1960)
*&quot;Oh! To be in England!&quot; (1963)
*&quot;A Little of What You Fancy?&quot; (1970)
The first novel in the series was originally adapted to the screen in 1959 as &quot;The Mating Game&quot;, starring Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randall as Mariette and Charley.

The fifth novel, &quot;A Little of What You Fancy?&quot;, was never adapted for television, but it was adapted into a six-part series by Eric Pringle for BBC Radio, with Jason and Ferris reprising their roles, first airing in February 1996.

In May 2011 a stage production of the series was put on at Buss Farm.

The most recent version is &quot;The Larkins&quot;, adapted for television in 2021.

<text>PTS-DOS (aka PTS/DOS) is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft and Paragon Technology Systems.

== History and versions ==
PhysTechSoft was formed in 1991 in Moscow, Russia by graduates and members of MIPT, informally known as PhysTech. At the end of 1993, PhysTechSoft released the first commercially available PTS-DOS as PTS-DOS v6.4. The version numbering followed MS-DOS version numbers, as Microsoft released MS-DOS 6.2 in November 1993.

In 1995, some programmers left PhysTechSoft and founded Paragon Technology Systems. They took source code with them and released their own version named PTS/DOS 6.51CD as well as S/DOS 1.0 (&quot;Source DOS&quot;), a stripped down open-source version. According to official PhysTechSoft announcements, these programmers violated both copyright laws and Russian military laws, as PTS-DOS was developed in close relationship with Russia&#x27;s military and thus may be subject to military secrets law.

PhysTechSoft continued development on their own and released PTS-DOS v6.6 somewhere between and presented PTS-DOS v6.65 at the CeBIT exhibition in 1997. The next version from PhysTechSoft, formally PTS/DOS Extended Version 6.70 was labeled PTS-DOS 2000 and is still being distributed as a last 16-bit PTS-DOS system, .

Paragon continued their PTS-DOS line and released Paragon DOS Pro 2000 (also known and labeled in some places as PTS/DOS Pro 2000). According to Paragon, this was the last version and all development since then ceased. Moreover, this release contained bundled source code of older PTS-DOS v6.51.

Later, PhysTechSoft continued developing PTS-DOS and finally released PTS-DOS 32, formally known as PTS-DOS v7.0, which added support for the FAT32 file system.

PTS-DOS is certified by the Russian Ministry of Defense.

<text>Thomas Fitzgerald (April 10, 1796March 25, 1855) was an American politician who served as a judge and state legislator in both Indiana and Michigan, and as a United States senator from Michigan. 

Fitzgerald was born in Germantown, in Herkimer County, New York. His father was an Irish immigrant, and fought with the Continental Army, was wounded and received a pension. Thomas received a common school education and fought with the U.S. Army the War of 1812. He was severely wounded and afterwards taught school for a time in Marcellus, New York. In 1819 he moved to Boonville, Indiana, where he taught school and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1821 and began a practice in Boonville. He was a member of the State House of Representatives in 1821 and from 1825 to 1827. He was a probate judge in Indiana in 1829.

In 1832, Fitzgerald was appointed keeper of the lighthouse at the mouth of the St. Joseph River and moved to St. Joseph, Michigan. He was clerk of Berrien County in 1834 and a regent of the University of Michigan in 1837.

He was appointed bank commissioner in 1838 to investigate what were called &quot;wildcat&quot; banks and served in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1839. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1839 and was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Lewis Cass, serving in the 30th Congress from June 8, 1848 until March 3, 1849.

He moved to Niles, Michigan in 1851 and served as probate judge of Berrien County from 1852 to 1855. He died in Niles and is interred in Silverbrook Cemetery.

<doc id="614142" wikidata="Q1229395" url="?curid=614142" title="Distant Early Warning Line">
<text>The Distant Early Warning Line, also known as the DEW Line or Early Warning Line, was a system of radar stations in the northern Arctic region of Canada, with additional stations along the north coast and Aleutian Islands of Alaska (see Project Stretchout and Project Bluegrass), in addition to the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. It was set up to detect incoming bombers of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and provide early warning of any sea-and-land invasion.

The DEW Line was the northernmost and most capable of three radar lines in Canada and Alaska. The first of these was the joint Canadian-United States Pinetree Line, which ran from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island just north of the Canada–United States border, but even while it was being built there were concerns that it would not provide enough warning time to launch an effective counterattack. The Mid-Canada Line (MCL) was proposed as an inexpensive solution using bistatic radar. This provided a &quot;trip wire&quot; warning located roughly at the 55th parallel, giving commanders ample warning time, but little information on the targets or their exact location. The MCL proved largely useless in practice, as the radar return of flocks of birds overwhelmed signals from aircraft.

The DEW Line was proposed as a solution to both of these problems, using conventional radar systems that could both detect and characterise an attack, while being located far to the north where they would offer hours of advance warning. This would not only provide ample time for the defences to prepare, but also allow the Strategic Air Command to get its active aircraft airborne long before Soviet bombers could reach their targets. The need was considered critical and the construction was given the highest national priorities. Advance site preparation began in December 1954, and the construction was carried out in a massive logistical operation that took place mostly during the summer months when the sites could be reached by ships. The 63-base line reached operational status in 1957. The MCL was shut down in the early 1960s, and much of the Pinetree Line was given over to civilian use.

In 1985, as part of the &quot;Shamrock Summit&quot;, the United States and Canada agreed to transition DEW to the new North Warning System (NWS). Beginning in 1988, most of the original DEW stations were deactivated, while a small number were upgraded with all-new equipment. The official handover from DEW to NWS took place on 15 July 1993.

==Introduction==
The shortest, or great circle, route for a Soviet air attack on North America was through the Arctic, across the area around the North Pole. The DEW Line was built during the Cold War to give early warning of a Soviet nuclear strike, to allow time for United States bombers to get off the ground and land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) to be launched, to reduce the chances that a preemptive strike could destroy the United States&#x27; strategic nuclear forces. The original DEW line was designed to detect bombers and was unable to detect ICBMs. To give warning of this threat, in 1958 a more sophisticated radar system was constructed, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS).

The DEW Line was a significant achievement among Cold War initiatives in the Arctic. A successful combination of scientific design and logistical planning of the late 1950s, the DEW Line consisted of a string of continental defence radar installations, ultimately stretching from Alaska to Greenland. In addition to the secondary Mid-Canada Line and the tertiary Pinetree Line, the DEW Line marked the edge of an electronic grid controlled by the new Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) computer system and was ultimately centred at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado, command hub of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

The construction of the DEW Line was made possible by a bilateral agreement between the Canadian and United States governments, and by collaboration between the United States Department of Defense and the Bell System of communication companies. The DEW Line grew out of a detailed study made by a group of the nation&#x27;s foremost scientists in 1952, the Summer Study Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The subject of the study was the vulnerability of the United States and Canada to aerial bombing attacks, and its concluding recommendation was that a &quot;distant early warning line&quot; of search radar stations be built across the Arctic region of the North American continent as rapidly as possible.

==Development and construction==

Improvements in Soviet technology rendered the Pinetree Line and Mid-Canada Line inadequate to provide enough early warning and on 15 February 1954, the Canadian and United States governments agreed to jointly build a third line of radar stations (Distant Early Warning), this time running across the high Arctic. The line would run roughly along the 69th parallel north, about north of the Arctic Circle.

Before this project was completed, men and women with the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience were drawn from Bell Telephone companies in every state in the United States, and many Canadian provinces. Much of the responsibility was delegated under close supervision to a vast number of subcontractors, suppliers, and United States military units.

The initial contract with the United States Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force provided for the design and construction of a small experimental system to determine at the beginning whether the idea was practicable. The designs of communication and radar detection equipment available at the time were known to be unsuited to the weather and atmospheric conditions to be encountered in the Arctic.

Early efforts were aided when, by happenstance, the US Navy terminated its oil exploration activities in Alaska. The associated infrastructure that had been established in the arctic was quickly repurposed to serve early development of the DEW line. Material converted from Navy use included 1,200 tons of supplies, with many Caterpillar D8 tractors, heavy duty cranes, diesel generators, and radio equipment. Most fortunately, the surplus included sixty equipped wannigans - enough to permit setup of field camps at all construction sites. (A &quot;wannigan&quot; is a building on sleds, about 12 x 20 feet in size. These were completely equipped for camp operations and were of various types - Cook, Mess, Bunk, Power Plant, Water, Shop, Storage, Utility, Steam Point, etc.)

Prototypes of several stations were designed and built in Alaska in 1953. A prototype built for training purposes was chosen to be located in Streator, Illinois in 1952. The Streator DEW-Line Training Center became operational in 1956 and closed when operations were moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1975. While few of the original designs for either buildings or equipment were retained, the trial installations did prove that the DEW Line was feasible, and they furnished a background of information that led to the final improved designs of all facilities and final plans for manpower, transportation, and supply.

With the experimental phase completed successfully, the Air Forces asked the Western Electric Company to proceed as rapidly as possible with the construction of the entire DEW Line. That was in December 1954, before the route to be followed in the eastern section had even been determined. The locations were surveyed out by John Anderson-Thompson. Siting crews covered the area – first from the air and then on the ground – to locate by scientific means the best sites for the main, auxiliary, and intermediate stations. These crews lived and worked under primitive conditions. They covered vast distances by airplanes, snowmobiles, and dog sleds, working in blinding snowstorms with temperatures so low that ordinary thermometers could not measure them. They completed their part of the job on schedule and set the stage for the crews and machines that followed. The line consisted of 63 stations stretching from Alaska to Baffin Island, covering nearly . The United States agreed to pay for and construct the line, and to employ Canadian labour as much as possible.

A target date for completing the DEW Line and having it in operation was set for 31 July 1957. This provided only two short Arctic summers adding up to about six months in which to work under passable conditions. Much of the work would have to be completed in the long, dark, cold, Arctic winters, including over a month of polar night.

=== Construction process ===

From a standing start in December 1954, many thousands of skilled workers were recruited, transported to the polar regions, housed, fed, and supplied with tools, machines, and materials to construct physical facilities – buildings, roads, tanks, towers, antennas, airfields, and hangars – in some of the most hostile and isolated environments in North America. The construction project employed about 25,000 people.

Western Electric and Alaska Freightlines, with the help of the United States Army Transportation Research and Development Command (TRADCOM), contracted to have a pair of off-road overland trains, the TC-264 Sno-Buggy, designed specifically for Arctic conditions, to be built by LeTourneau Technologies, owned by R. G. LeTourneau. The TC-264 Sno-Buggy was the longest off-road vehicle ever built at the time, with its six cars (including the locomotive) measuring a total of . Each car was driven by four tall wheels and tires. The 24-wheel-drive was powered by two 400 horsepower Cummins diesel engines connected to a hub motor. It had a payload capacity of , and could traverse nearly any terrain. It had a very successful first season hauling freight to the DEW Line. Later, military and civilian airlifts, huge sealifts during the short summers, barges contributed to the distribution of vast cargoes along the length of the Line to build the permanent settlements needed at each site. Much of the job of carrying mountains of supplies to the northern sites fell to military and naval units. More than 3,000 United States Army Transportation Corps soldiers were given special training to prepare them for the job of unloading ships in the Arctic. They went with the convoys of United States Navy ships and they raced time during the few weeks the ice was open to land supplies at dozens of spots on the shores of the Arctic Ocean during the summers of 1955, 1956, and 1957.

Scores of military and commercial pilots, flying everything from small bush planes to four-engined turboprops, were the backbone of the operation. The Lockheed LC-130, a ski-equipped version of the C-130 Hercules, owned by the United States Air Force and operated by the 139th Airlift Squadron, provided a significant amount of airlift to sites that were out on ice caps such as Dye 3 in Greenland. Transport planes such as the C-124 Globemaster and the C-119 Flying Boxcar also supported the project. Together, these provided the only means of access to many of the stations during the wintertime. In all, of materials were moved from the United States and southern Canada to the Arctic by air, land, and sea.

As the stacks of materials at the station sites mounted, construction went ahead rapidly. Subcontractors with a flair for tackling difficult construction projects handled the bulk of this work under the direction of Western Electric engineers. Huge quantities of gravel were produced and moved. The construction work needed to build housing, airstrips, aircraft hangars, outdoor and covered antennas, and antenna towers was done by subcontractors. In all, over 7,000 bulldozer operators, carpenters, masons, plumbers, welders, electricians, and other tradesmen from the United States and southern Canada worked on the project. Concrete was poured in the middle of Arctic winters, buildings were constructed, electrical service, heating, and fresh water were provided, huge steel antenna towers were erected, airstrips and hangars were built, putting it all together in darkness, blizzards, and subzero temperatures.

After the buildings came the installation of radar and communications equipment, then the thorough and time-consuming testing of each unit individually and of the system as an integrated whole. Finally all was ready, and on 15 April 1957 – just two years and eight months after the decision to build the Distant Early Warning Line was made – Western Electric turned over to the Air Force on schedule a complete, operating radar system across the top of North America, with its own communications network. Later, the system coverage was expanded even further: see Project Stretchout and Project Bluegrass.

The majority of Canadian DEW Line stations were the joint responsibility of the Royal Canadian Air Force (the Canadian Armed Forces) and the United States Air Force. The USAF component was the 64th Air Division, Air Defense Command. The 4601st Support Squadron, based in Paramus, New Jersey, was activated by ADC to provide logistical and contractual support for DEW Line operations. In 1958, the line became a cornerstone of the new North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) organization of joint continental air defence.

USAF personnel were limited to the main stations for each sector and they performed annual inspections of auxiliary and intermediate stations as part of the contract administration. Most operations were performed by Canadian and United States civilian personnel, and the operations were automated as much as was possible at the time. All of the installations flew both the Canadian and United States flags until they were deactivated as DEW sites and sole jurisdiction was given to the Government of Canada as part of the North Warning System in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Radar system==

The Point Lay, Alaska DEW line station has a typical suite of systems. The main AN/FPS-19 search radar is in the dome, flanked by two AN/FRC-45 lateral communications dishes (or AN/FRC-102, depending on the date). To the left are the much larger southbound AN/FRC-101 communications dishes. Not visible is the AN/FPS-23 &quot;gap filler&quot; doppler antenna.

The DEW Line was upgraded with fifteen new AN/FPS-117 passive electronically scanned array radar systems between 1985 and 1994, and the line was then renamed the North Warning System.

Modifications to each operating radar station occurred during the construction phase of the DEW Line system. This was due to the extreme winds, frigid temperatures, and the ground conditions due to permafrost and ice. There were two significant electronic modifications that were also crucial to the functioning of these radar stations in an Arctic environment. One reduced the effects of vibration in correlation to temperature change, the other increased the pulse duration from two to six microseconds. It also began using a crystal oscillator for more stable readings and accurate accounts of movement within the air.

==Operations==

There were three types of stations: small unstaffed &quot;gap filler stations&quot; that were checked by ground crews only every few months during the summer; intermediate stations with only a station chief, a cook, and a mechanic; and larger stations that had a variable number of employees and may have had libraries, forms of entertainment, and other accommodations. The stations used a number of long-range L band – emitting systems known as the AN/FPS-19. The &quot;gaps&quot; between the stations were watched by the directional AN/FPS-23 doppler radar systems, similar to those pioneered only a few years earlier on the Mid-Canada Line. The stations were interconnected by White Alice, a series of radio communications systems that used tropospheric scatter technology.

For stations at the western end of the line, buildings at the deactivated Pet-4 United States Navy camp at Point Barrow were converted into workshops where prefabricated panels, fully insulated, were assembled to form modular building units long, wide, and high. These modules were put on sleds and drawn to station sites hundreds of miles away by powerful tractors. Each main station had its own airstrip – as close to the buildings as safety regulations and the terrain permitted. Service buildings, garages, connecting roads, storage tanks, and perhaps an aircraft hangar completed the community. Drifting snow was a constant menace. Siting engineers and advance parties learned this the hard way when their tents disappeared beneath the snow in a few hours. The permanent H-shaped buildings at the main stations were always pointed into the prevailing winds and their bridges built high off the ground.

The Arctic region was frequently transited by commercial aircraft on polar routes, either flying between Europe and western North America, or between Europe and Asia using Alaska as a stopover. These flights would penetrate the DEW Line. To differentiate these commercial flights from Soviet bombers, the flight crews had to transmit their flight plan to an Air Movement Identification System (AMIS) centre at either Goose Bay, Edmonton, or Anchorage. These stations then passed the information on to the DEW Line. If an unknown flight was detected, the DEW Line station would contact AMIS to see if a flight plan might have been missed; if not, NORAD was notified. Military flights, including B-52 bombers, frequently operated in the polar regions and used identification friend or foe (IFF) systems to authenticate the flight.

The early warning provided was useless against ICBMs and submarine-launched attacks. These were countered and tempered by the mutual assured destruction (MAD) philosophy. However, the scenario of a coordinated airborne invasion coupled with a limited nuclear strike was the real threat that this line protected against. It did so by providing Distant Early Warning of an inbound aerial invasion force, which would have to appear at the far north hours ahead of any warhead launches in order to be coordinated well enough to prevent MAD. A number of intermediate stations were decommissioned, since their effectiveness was judged to be less than desired and required. The staffed stations were retained to monitor potential Soviet air activities and to allow Canada to assert sovereignty in the Arctic. International law requires a country that claims territory to actively occupy and defend such territory.

Because the advent of ICBMs created another attack scenario that the DEW Line could not defend against, in 1958 the United States Federal Government authorized construction of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), at a reported cost of $28 billion.

In 1985, it was decided that the more capable of the DEW Line stations were to be upgraded with the GE AN/FPS-117 radar systems and merged with newly built stations into the North Warning System. Their automation was increased and a number of additional stations were closed. This upgrading was completed in 1990, and with the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States withdrew all of its personnel and relinquished full operation of the Canadian stations to Canada. Costs for the Canadian sector were still subsidized by the United States. However, the American flags were lowered at the Canadian stations and only the Canadian flag remained. The United States retained responsibility and all operational costs for North Warning System stations located in Alaska and Greenland.

==Canadian perception==
From the beginning of the development of the DEW Line idea, Canadian concerns over political perception grew enormously. Noted Canadian Arctic historian P. Whitney Lackenbauer argues that the Canadian Government saw little intrinsic value in the Arctic, but due to fear of Americanization and American penetration into the Canadian Arctic, brought significant changes and a more militaristic role to the north. This shift into a more military role began with a transition of authority, shifting responsibility of Arctic defence in Canada from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to the Canadian Armed Forces. This &quot;active defence&quot; had three key elements: minimizing the extent of the American presence in the Canadian Arctic, Canadian government input into the management of the DEW Line, and full Canadian participation in Arctic defence.

Funding problems for the DEW Line also played a role in perception of the project. American investment in building and operating the DEW Line system declined as the ICBM threat refocused priorities, but Canada did not fill the void with commensurate additional funding. In 1968 a Canadian Department of National Defence Paper (27 November 1968) stated no further funding for research on the DEW Line or air space would be allocated due in part to lack of commercial activity The Canadian Government also limited United States air activity, base activity, soldier numbers, and contractor numbers; and the overall operation would be considered and called in all formalities a &quot;joint operation&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
The cultural impact of the DEW Line System is immense and significant to the heritage of Canada and Alaska. In Canada, the DEW line increased connections between the populous south and the remote High Arctic, helping to bring Inuit more thoroughly into the Canadian polity. The construction and operating of the DEW Line provided some economic development for the Arctic region. This provided momentum for further development through research, new communications, and new studies of the area. Although the construction of the DEW line itself was placed in American hands, much of the later development was under direct Canadian direction.

Resource protection of historical DEW Line sites is currently under discussion in Canada and Alaska. The discussion stems from the deactivation aspect of the sites and arguments over what to do with leftover equipment and leftover intact sites. Many Canadian historians encourage the preservation of DEW Line sites through heritage designations. 

The DEW Line is a setting for the 1957 film &quot;The Deadly Mantis&quot;. The film begins with a short documentary on the three RADAR lines, focusing on the DEW Line&#x27;s construction.

==Deactivation and clean-up==
A controversy also developed between the United States and Canada over the cleanup of deactivated Canadian DEW Line sites. The cleanup is now underway, site by site. In assessing the cleanup, new research suggests that off-road vehicles damaged vegetation and organic matter, resulting in the melting of the permafrost, a key component to the hydrological systems of the areas. The DEW Line has also been linked to depleted fish stocks and carelessness in agitating local animals such as the caribou, as well as non-seasonal hunting. These aspects are claimed to have had a devastating impact on the local native subsistence economies and environment.

==Atlantic and Pacific Barrier==

The DEW line was supplemented by the Contiguous Radar Coverage System, which included two &quot;barrier&quot; forces in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans which were operated by the United States Navy from 1956 to 1965. These barrier forces consisted of surface picket stations, dubbed &quot;Texas Towers&quot;, a surface naval force of 12 radar picket destroyer escorts and 16 Guardian-class radar picket ships, and an air wing of Lockheed WV-2 Warning Star aircraft that patrolled the picket lines at an altitude of in 12- to 14-hour missions. Their objective was to extend early warning coverage against surprise Soviet bomber and missile attack as an extension of the DEW Line.

The Atlantic Barrier (BarLant) consisted of two rotating squadrons, one based at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, to fly orbits to the Lajes Field in the Azores and back; and the other at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. BarLant began operations on 1 July 1956, and flew continuous coverage until early 1965, when the barrier was shifted to cover the approaches between Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom (GIUK barrier). Aircraft from Argentia were staged through Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland, to extend coverage times.

The Pacific Barrier (BarPac) began operations with one squadron operating from Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii, and a forward refuelling base at Naval Air Facility Midway Island, on 1 July 1958. Planes flew from Midway Island to Naval Air Facility Adak on Adak Island (in the Aleutian Island chain) and back, non-stop. Its orbits overlapped the radar picket stations of the ships of Escort Squadron Seven (CORTRON SEVEN), from roughly Kodiak Island to the Midway Atoll and Escort Squadron Five (CORTRON FIVE), from Pearl Harbor to northern Pacific waters. Normally four or five WV-2s were required at any single time to provide coverage over the entire line. This coverage was later augmented, and modified/replaced by Project Stretchout and Project Bluegrass).

The &quot;Guardian&quot;-class radar picket ships were based in Rhode Island and San Francisco, and covered picket stations off each coast.

Barrier Force operations were discontinued by September 1965 and their EC-121K (WV-2 before 1962) aircraft placed in storage.

<text>Guy Clarence Vanderhaeghe (born April 5, 1951) is a Canadian novelist and short story writer, best known for his Western novel trilogy, &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot;, &quot;The Last Crossing&quot;, and &quot;A Good Man&quot; set in the 19th-century American and Canadian West. Vanderhaeghe has won three Governor General&#x27;s Awards for his fiction, one for his short story collection &quot;Man Descending&quot; in 1982, the second for his novel &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot; in 1996, and the third for his short story collection &quot;Daddy Lenin and Other Stories&quot; in 2015.

==Life and career==
Guy Vanderhaeghe was born on April 5, 1951, in Esterhazy, a mining town in southeastern Saskatchewan. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree with great distinction in 1971, High Honours in History in 1972 and Master of Arts in History in 1975, all from the University of Saskatchewan. In 1978 he received his Bachelor of Education with great distinction from the University of Regina. In 1973 he was Research Officer, Institute for Northern Studies, University of Saskatchewan and, from 1974 until 1977, he worked as Archival and Library Assistant at the university.

From 1975 to 1977 he was a freelance writer and editor and in 1978 and 1979 taught English and history at Herbert High School in Herbert, Saskatchewan. In 1983 and 1984 he was Writer-in-Residence with the Saskatoon Public Library and in 1985 Writer-in-Residence at the University of Ottawa. He has been a Visiting Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Ottawa (1985–86), faculty member of the Writing Program of the Banff Centre for the Arts (1990–91), faculty member in charge of senior fiction students in the SAGE Hills Creative Writing Program (1992). Since 1993, he has served as a visiting professor of English at St. Thomas More College at the University of Saskatchewan.

Vanderhaeghe&#x27;s first book, &quot;Man Descending&quot; (1982), was winner of a Governor General&#x27;s Award and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Faber Prize. A novel, &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1996), won him a second Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction and the Saskatchewan Book Award for Fiction and for Best Book of the Year, and it was shortlisted for both the Giller Prize and the International Dublin Literary Award.

&quot;The Last Crossing&quot; (2002) was a national bestseller and winner of the Saskatoon Book Award, the Saskatchewan Book Awards for Fiction and for Book of the Year, and the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Fiction Book of the Year. The novel was selected for the 2004 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot; as the book that should be read by all Canadians.

In 2003, Vanderhaeghe was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. His 2011 publication of &quot;A Good Man&quot; finished off his Western trilogy. &quot;Historically spot on, the characters (fictional and real) are incredible, and the plot builds to an incredible bitter sweet ending.&quot;
In 2013, he received the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts, Saskatchewan&#x27;s highest honour in the arts.

<text>The Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm (named after Donald Knuth and Peter Bendix) is a semi-decision algorithm for transforming a set of equations (over terms) into a confluent term rewriting system. When the algorithm succeeds, it effectively solves the word problem for the specified algebra.

Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm for computing Gröbner bases is a very similar algorithm. Although developed independently, it may also be seen as the instantiation of Knuth–Bendix algorithm in the theory of polynomial rings.

==Introduction==

For a set &quot;E&quot; of equations, its deductive closure () is the set of all equations that can be derived by applying equations from &quot;E&quot; in any order.
Formally, &quot;E&quot; is considered a binary relation, () is its rewrite closure, and () is the equivalence closure of ().
For a set &quot;R&quot; of rewrite rules, its deductive closure ( ∘ ) is the set of all equations that can be confirmed by applying rules from &quot;R&quot; left-to-right to both sides until they are literally equal.
Formally, &quot;R&quot; is again viewed as a binary relation, () is its rewrite closure, () is its converse, and ( ∘ ) is the relation composition of their reflexive transitive closures ( and ).

For example, if are the group axioms, the derivation chain
demonstrates that &quot;a&quot;−1⋅(&quot;a&quot;⋅&quot;b&quot;) &quot;b&quot; is a member of &quot;E&quot;&#x27;s deductive closure.
If is a &quot;rewrite rule&quot; version of &quot;E&quot;, the derivation chains
demonstrate that (&quot;a&quot;−1⋅&quot;a&quot;)⋅&quot;b&quot; ∘ &quot;b&quot; is a member of &quot;R&quot;&#x27;s deductive closure.
However, there is no way to derive &quot;a&quot;−1⋅(&quot;a&quot;⋅&quot;b&quot;) ∘ &quot;b&quot; similar to above, since a right-to-left application of the rule is not allowed.

The Knuth–Bendix algorithm takes a set &quot;E&quot; of equations between terms, and a reduction ordering (&gt;) on the set of all terms, and attempts to construct a confluent and terminating term rewriting system &quot;R&quot; that has the same deductive closure as &quot;E&quot;.
While proving consequences from &quot;E&quot; often requires human intuition, proving consequences from &quot;R&quot; does not.
For more details, see Confluence (abstract rewriting)#Motivating examples, which gives an example proof from group theory, performed both using &quot;E&quot; and using &quot;R&quot;.

==Rules==

Given a set &quot;E&quot; of equations between terms, the following inference rules can be used to transform it into an equivalent convergent term rewrite system (if possible):
They are based on a user-given reduction ordering (&gt;) on the set of all terms; it is lifted to a well-founded ordering (▻) on the set of rewrite rules by defining if 
* in the encompassment ordering, or
* and are literally similar and .

==Example==

The following example run, obtained from the E theorem prover, computes a completion of the (additive) group axioms as in Knuth, Bendix (1970).
It starts with the three initial equations for the group (neutral element 0, inverse elements, associativity), using codice_1 for &quot;X&quot;+&quot;Y&quot;, and codice_2 for −&quot;X&quot;. 
The 10 starred equations turn out to constitute the resulting convergent rewrite system.
&quot;pm&quot; is short for &quot;paramodulation&quot;, implementing &quot;deduce&quot;. Critical pair computation is an instance of paramodulation for equational unit clauses.
&quot;rw&quot; is rewriting, implementing &quot;compose&quot;, &quot;collapse&quot;, and &quot;simplify&quot;.
Orienting of equations is done implicitly and not recorded.

See also Word problem (mathematics) for another presentation of this example.

==String rewriting systems in group theory==

An important case in computational group theory are string rewriting systems which can be used to give canonical labels to elements or cosets of a finitely presented group as products of the generators. This special case is the focus of this section.

=== Motivation in group theory ===
The critical pair lemma states that a term rewriting system is locally confluent (or weakly confluent) if and only if all its critical pairs are convergent. Furthermore, we have Newman&#x27;s lemma which states that if an (abstract) rewriting system is strongly normalizing and weakly confluent, then the rewriting system is confluent. So, if we can add rules to the term rewriting system in order to force all critical pairs to be convergent while maintaining the strong normalizing property, then this will force the resultant rewriting system to be confluent.

Consider a finitely presented monoid formula_1 where X is a finite set of generators and R is a set of defining relations on X. Let X* be the set of all words in X (i.e. the free monoid generated by X). Since the relations R generate an equivalence relation on X*, one can consider elements of M to be the equivalence classes of X* under R. For each class &quot;{w1, w2, ... }&quot; it is desirable to choose a standard representative &quot;wk&quot;. This representative is called the canonical or normal form for each word &quot;wk&quot; in the class. If there is a computable method to determine for each &quot;wk&quot; its normal form &quot;wi&quot; then the word problem is easily solved. A confluent rewriting system allows one to do precisely this.

Although the choice of a canonical form can theoretically be made in an arbitrary fashion this approach is generally not computable. (Consider that an equivalence relation on a language can produce an infinite number of infinite classes.) If the language is well-ordered then the order &lt; gives a consistent method for defining minimal representatives, however computing these representatives may still not be possible. In particular, if a rewriting system is used to calculate minimal representatives then the order &lt; should also have the property:

: A &lt; B → XAY &lt; XBY for all words A,B,X,Y

This property is called translation invariance. An order that is both translation-invariant and a well-order is called a reduction order.

From the presentation of the monoid it is possible to define a rewriting system given by the relations R. If A x B is in R then either A &lt; B in which case B → A is a rule in the rewriting system, otherwise A &gt; B and A → B. Since &lt; is a reduction order a given word W can be reduced W &gt; W_1 &gt; ... &gt; W_n where W_n is irreducible under the rewriting system. However, depending on the rules that are applied at each Wi → Wi+1 it is possible to end up with two different irreducible reductions Wn ≠ W&#x27;m of W. However, if the rewriting system given by the relations is converted to a confluent rewriting system via the Knuth–Bendix algorithm, then all reductions are guaranteed to produce the same irreducible word, namely the normal form for that word.

===Description of the algorithm for finitely presented monoids===

Suppose we are given a presentation formula_2, where formula_3 is a set of generators and formula_4 is a set of relations giving the rewriting system. Suppose further that we have a reduction ordering formula_5 among the words generated by formula_3(e.g., shortlex order). For each relation formula_7 in formula_4, suppose formula_9. Thus we begin with the set of reductions formula_10.

First, if any relation formula_7 can be reduced, replace formula_12 and formula_13 with the reductions.

Next, we add more reductions (that is, rewriting rules) to eliminate possible exceptions of confluence. Suppose that formula_12 and formula_15 overlap.

# Case 1: either the prefix of formula_16 equals the suffix of formula_15, or vice versa. In the former case, we can write formula_18 and formula_19; in the latter case, formula_20 and formula_21.
#Case 2: either formula_16 is completely contained in (surrounded by) formula_15, or vice versa. In the former case, we can write formula_24 and formula_25; in the latter case, formula_26 and formula_27.

Reduce the word formula_28 using formula_12 first, then using formula_15 first. Call the results formula_31, respectively. If formula_32, then we have an instance where confluence could fail. Hence, add the reduction formula_33 to formula_4.

After adding a rule to formula_4, remove any rules in formula_4 that might have reducible left sides (after checking if such rules have critical pairs with other rules).

Repeat the procedure until all overlapping left sides have been checked.

===Examples===

==== A terminating example ====
Consider the monoid: 
:formula_37. 
We use the shortlex order. This is an infinite monoid but nevertheless, the Knuth–Bendix algorithm is able to solve the word problem.

Our beginning three reductions are therefore


A suffix of formula_38 (namely formula_39) is a prefix of formula_40, so consider the word formula_41. Reducing using (), we get formula_42. Reducing using (), we get formula_43. Hence, we get formula_44, giving the reduction rule

Similarly, using formula_45 and reducing using () and (), we get formula_46. Hence the reduction

Both of these rules obsolete (), so we remove it.

Next, consider formula_47 by overlapping () and (). Reducing we get formula_48, so we add the rule
Considering formula_49 by overlapping () and (), we get formula_50, so we add the rule
These obsolete rules () and (), so we remove them.

Now, we are left with the rewriting system


Checking the overlaps of these rules, we find no potential failures of confluence. Therefore, we have a confluent rewriting system, and the algorithm terminates successfully.

==== A non-terminating example ====
The order of the generators may crucially affect whether the Knuth–Bendix completion terminates. As an example, consider the free Abelian group by the monoid presentation:

: formula_51

The Knuth–Bendix completion with respect to lexicographic order formula_52 finishes with a convergent system, however considering the length-lexicographic order formula_53 it does not finish for there are no finite convergent systems compatible with this latter order.

==Generalizations==

If Knuth–Bendix does not succeed, it will either run forever and produce successive approximations to an infinite complete system, or fail when it encounters an unorientable equation (i.e. an equation that it cannot turn into a rewrite rule). An enhanced version will not fail on unorientable equations and produces a ground confluent system, providing a semi-algorithm for the word problem.

The notion of logged rewriting discussed in the paper by Heyworth and Wensley listed below allows some recording or logging of the rewriting process as it proceeds. This is useful for computing identities among relations for presentations of groups.

<doc id="614149" wikidata="Q365381" url="?curid=614149" title="Rafael Carrera">
<text>José Rafael Carrera y Turcios (24 October 1814 – 14 April 1865) was the president of Guatemala from 1844 to 1848 and from 1851 until his death in 1865, after being appointed President for life in 1854. During his military career and presidency, new nations in Central America were facing numerous problems: William Walker&#x27;s invasions, liberal attempts to overthrow the Catholic Church and aristocrats&#x27; power, the Civil War in the United States, Mayan uprising in the east, Belize boundary dispute with the United Kingdom, and the wars in Mexico under Benito Juárez. This led to a rise of caudillos, a term that refers to charismatic populist leaders among the indigenous people.

Backed by the Catholic Church, conservatives of the Aycinena clan led by Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol, and mestizo and indigenous peasants, he dominated politics in the first three decades of Guatemala&#x27;s independence more than any other individual. He led the revolt against the liberal state government of Mariano Gálvez in Guatemala, and then was instrumental in breaking up the Federal Republic of Central America that the liberals wanted. As a result, once the liberals took over power in Guatemala in 1871, Carrera&#x27;s character and regime were dismissed and demonized, making him look as an illiterate who could not even write his own name and was a puppet of the aristocrats. Over the years, even Marxist writers who wanted to show how the native Guatemalans have been exploited by the elites completely ignored Carrera&#x27;s interest in them and accused him of racism and being a &quot;little king&quot;.

== Early life ==
Carrera was born on 24 October 1814 in the Candelaria barrio of Guatemala City towards the end of the Spanish colonial period. He was of humble origin, a mestizo and illiterate. He first worked as a farmhand. He enlisted in the army during the civil war, which lasted from 1826 to 1829. In 1835, he left the army and moved to Mataquescuintla where he married Petrona García and worked as a swineherd.

== Rise to power ==
By 1837, rural masses were voicing numerous grievances against the liberal government of Guatemala. Inexperienced in republican politics, the liberal leaders did not foresee the power of popular resistance and refused to change course. A cholera epidemic added to the frustration over grievances, led to panic, and helped Carrera rally the peasants into armed resistance. Strongly supported by the Church, Carrera became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of much of Guatemala and led a large uprising of Indians and poor peasants of mixed race in the east and south of the country, an area known as The Mountain. The movement was strongly pro-Catholic and eager to restore many of the colonial religious institutions and traditions that the liberals had abandoned. Francisco Morazán repeatedly drove Carrera&#x27;s forces out of cities and towns, but Carrera&#x27;s followers would retake places as soon as Morazán&#x27;s army left. For almost a decade, he was content being a military commander and enjoyed the respect of his followers.

Even though they distrusted and despised him, the conservative criollos from the Aycinena Clan, decided to support Carrera in the hope of regaining the power and privileges that they had lost in 1829 after Morazán&#x27;s invasion of Guatemala. Under the leadership of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol the conservatives aimed to regain their place as Guatemala&#x27;s elite from which the liberals had expelled them.

=== Battles with Morazán ===

Even though Carrera is often portrayed as a &quot;guerrilla&quot; leader, an analysis of his military campaigns between 1837 and 1840 shows that he utilized a method of fighting that can be more accurately described as hybrid warfare, a combination of guerrilla tactics and logistics with conventional combat operations. While his soldiers were not well equipped, their training in the local militias, going back to colonial times and the civil war that followed independence from Spain, enabled them to successfully fight conventional battles against the numerically superior forces of the Guatemalan and Federal governments. In 1838 the liberal forces of Morazán and José Francisco Barrundia invaded Guatemala and reached San Sur, where they executed Pascual García, Carrera&#x27;s father-in-law. They impaled his head on a pike as a warning to all followers of the Guatemalan caudillo. On learning this, Carrera and his wife Petrona – who had come to confront Morazán as soon as they learned of the invasion and were in Mataquescuintla – swore they would never forgive Morazán even in his grave; they felt it impossible to respect anyone who would not avenge family members. After sending several envoys, whom Carrera would not receive – especially Barrundia whom Carrera did not want to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of their few assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains . Believing that Carrera was totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched on to Guatemala City, where they were welcomed as saviors by the state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative Aycinena Clan, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had. The criollos of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.

Morazán used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela by Mariano Rivera Paz, member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829; in revenge, Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol voted for the dissolution of the Central American Federation in San Salvador a little later, forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to fight to save his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera. Knowing that Morazán had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take Salamá with the small force that remained, but was defeated, losing his brother Laureano in the combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to Sanarate. Under conventional warfare conditions, this defeat would have ended Carrera&#x27;s military campaign. However, by this time the young commander had already become accustomed to disassemble and regroup, not just after defeats but also after victories. Carrera&#x27;s pursuit of a military approach that combined alternately guerrilla and conventional warfare enabled him to reconstitute his forces while keeping some degree of pressure on the government. Without any permanent means of financing the struggle, Carrera was able to bring together large forces for significant operations, and then send his soldiers back to their farms after engagement. The government, on the other hand, had to spend precious resources fielding permanent forces. After recovering to some extent, he attacked a detachment in Jutiapa and managed to get a small amount of booty which he handed to the volunteers who accompanied him and prepared to attack Petapa – near Guatemala City – where he was victorious, though with heavy casualties. In September of that year, he attempted an assault on the capital of Guatemala, but the liberal general Carlos Salazar Castro defeated him in the fields of Villa Nueva and Carrera had to retreat. After an unsuccessful attempt to take the Quetzaltenango, Carrera was surrounded and wounded, and he had to capitulate to the Mexican General Agustin Guzman, who had been in Quetzaltenango since the time of Vicente Filísola&#x27;s arrival in 1823. Morazán had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of Francisco Ferrera in El Salvador; instead, Morazán left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, and without any weapons. Knowing that Morazán was going to attack El Salvador, Francisco Ferrera gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City.

Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitely crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the Guatemalan capital, in place in since the battle of Villa Nueva. Taking advantage of Salazar&#x27;s good faith and Ferrera&#x27;s weapons, Carrera took Guatemala City by surprise on April 13, 1839; Castro Salazar, Mariano Gálvez and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera&#x27;s militia men. Salazar, in his nightshirt, vaulted roofs of neighboring houses and sought refuge; reaching the border disguised as a peasant. With Salazar gone, Carrera reinstated Rivera Paz as Head of State of Guatemala.

=== Invasion and Absorption of Los Altos ===


On April 2, 1838, in the city of Quetzaltenango, a secessionist group founded the independent State of Los Altos which sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, leaving their exile in El Salvador. The liberals in Los Altos began severely criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; they had their own newspaper – &quot;El Popular&quot;, which contributed to the harsh criticism. Moreover, Los Altos was the region with the main production and economic activity of the former state of Guatemala; without Los Altos, conservatives lost much of the resources that had given Guatemala hegemony in Central America. Then, the government of Guatemala tried to reach to a peaceful solution, but altenses, protected by the recognition of the Central American Federation Congress, did not accept; Guatemala&#x27;s government then resorted to force, sending Carrera as commanding general of the Army to subdue Los Altos.

Carrera defeated General Agustin Guzman when the former Mexican officer tried to ambush him and then went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime instead of the liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving leniently towards them as it was the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them that there would be no mercy if there was a second time. Finally, Guzmán, and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840; in the case of Guzman, shackled, still with bleeding wounds, and riding a mule.

=== Morazán Second Invasion of Guatemala ===

On March 18, 1840, liberal caudillo Morazán invaded Guatemala with 1500 soldiers to avenge the insult done in Los Altos. Fearing that such action would end with liberal efforts to hold together the Central American Federation, Guatemala had a cordon of guards from the border with El Salvador; without a telegraph service, men ran carrying last-minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched a plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero in charge of troops who presented only slight resistance in the city. Carrera pretended to flee and led his ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno, with few men, few rifles and two old cannons. The city was at the mercy of the army of Morazán, with bells of the twenty churches ringing for divine assistance. Once Morazán reached the capital, he took it easily and freed Guzman, who immediately left for Quetzaltenango to give the news that Carrera was defeated; Carrera then, taking advantage of what his enemies believed, applied a strategy of concentrating fire on the Central Park of the city and also employed surprise attack tactics which caused heavy casualties to the army of Morazán, finally forcing the survivors to fight for their lives. Morazán&#x27;s soldiers lost the initiative and their previous numerical superiority. Furthermore, in unfamiliar surroundings in the city, they had to fight, carry their dead and care for their wounded while resentful and tired from the long march from El Salvador to Guatemala. Carrera, by then an experienced military man, was able to defeat Morazán thoroughly.

The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Angel Molina who knew the streets of the city, had to flee with his favorite men, disguised, shouting &quot;Long live Carrera!&quot; through the ravine of &quot;El Incienso&quot; to El Salvador. In his absence, Morazán had been supplanted as Head of State of his country, and had to embark for exile in Peru. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, while Carrera was out in unsuccessful pursuit of Morazan. This engagement sealed the status of Carrera and marked the decline of Morazán, and forced the conservative Aycinena clan criollos to negotiate with Carrera and his peasant revolutionary supporters.

Guzmán, who was freed by Morazán when the latter had seemingly defeated Carrera in Guatemala City, had gone back to Quetzaltenango to bring the good news. The city liberal criollo leaders rapidly reinstated the Los Altos State and celebrated Morazán&#x27;s victory. However, as soon as Carrera and the newly reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz heard the news, Carrera went back to Quetzaltenango with his volunteer army to regain control of the rebel liberal state once and for all. On April 2, 1840, after entering the city, Carrera told the citizens that he had already warned them after he defeated them earlier that year. Then, he ordered the majority of the liberal city hall officials from Los Altos to be shot. Carrera then forcibly annexed Quetzaltenango and much of Los Altos back into conservative Guatemala. After the violent and bloody reinstatement of the State of Los Altos by Carrera in April 1840, Luis Batres Juarros – conservative member of the Aycinena Clan, then secretary general of the Guatemalan government of recently reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz – obtained from the vicar Larrazabal authorization to dismantle the regionalist Church. Serving priests of Quetzaltenango – capital of the would-be-state of Los Altos, Urban Ugarte and his coadjutor, José Maria Aguilar, were removed from their parish and likewise the priests of the parishes of San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Tolimán. Larrazabal ordered the priests Fernando Antonio Dávila, Mariano Navarrete and Jose Ignacio Iturrioz to cover the parishes of Quetzaltenango, San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Toliman, respectively.

The liberal criollos&#x27; defeat and execution in Quetzaltenango enhanced Carrera&#x27;s status with the native population of the area, whom he respected and protected.

=== Belgian colony ===

In 1840, Belgium began to act as an external source of support for Carrera&#x27;s independence movement, in an effort to exert influence in Central America. The &quot;Compagnie belge de colonisation&quot; (Belgian Colonization Company), commissioned by Belgian King Leopold I, became the administrator of Santo Tomas de Castilla in Izabal replacing the failed British Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company. Even though the colony eventually crumbled due to the endemic diseases that plagued the area, Belgium continued to support Carrera in the mid-19th century, although Britain continued to be the main business and political partner to Carrera&#x27;s regime.

== First presidency ==

Rafael Carrera was appointed president in 1844 and on March 21, 1847, by executive order declared Guatemala an independent republic, becoming its first president.

=== Caste War of Yucatán ===


In Yucatán, then an independent republic north of Guatemala, a war started between the natives and the mestizo and criollo populations; this war seemed rooted in the defense of communal lands against the expansion of private ownership, which was accentuated by the boom in the production of henequén, which was an important industrial fiber used to make rope. After discovering the value of the plant, the wealthier Yucateco criollos (local-born Spaniards) started plantations, beginning in 1833, to cultivate it on a large scale; not long after the henequen boom, a boom in sugar production led to more wealth. The sugar and henequén plantations encroached on native communal land, and native workers recruited to work on the plantations were mistreated and underpaid.

However, rebel leaders in their correspondence with British Honduras (Belize) were more often inclined to cite taxation as the immediate cause of the war; Jacinto Pat, for example, wrote in 1848 that &quot;what we want is liberty and not oppression, because before we were subjugated with the many contributions and taxes that they imposed on us.&quot; Pac&#x27;s companion, Cecilio Chi added in 1849, that promises made by the rebel Santiago Imán, that he was &quot;liberating the Indians from the payment of contributions&quot; as a reason for resisting the central government, but in fact he continued levying them.

In June 1847, Méndez learned that a large force of armed natives and supplies had gathered at the Culumpich, a property owned by Jacinto Pat, the Maya &quot;batab&quot; (leader), near Valladolid. Fearing revolt, Mendez arrested Manuel Antonio Ay, the principal Maya leader of Chichimilá, accused of planning a revolt, and executed him at the town square of Valladolid. Furthermore, Méndez searching for other insurgents burned the town of Tepich and repressed its residents. In the following months, several Maya towns were sacked and many people arbitrarily killed. In his letter of 1849, Cecilio Chi noted that Santiago Mendez had come to &quot;put every Indian, big and little, to death&quot; but that the Maya had responded to some degree, in kind, writing &quot;it has pleased God and good fortune that a much greater portion of them [whites] than of the Indians [have died].

Cecilio Chi, the native leader of Tepich, along with Jacinto Pat attacked Tepich on 30 July 1847, in reaction to the indiscriminate massacre of Mayas, ordered that all the non-Maya population be killed. By spring of 1848, the Maya forces had taken over most of the Yucatán, with the exception of the walled cities of Campeche and Mérida and the south-west coast, with Yucatecan troops holding the road from Mérida to the port of Sisal. The Yucatecan governor Miguel Barbachano had prepared a decree for the evacuation of Mérida, but was apparently delayed in publishing it by the lack of suitable paper in the besieged capital. The decree became unnecessary when the republican troops suddenly broke the siege and took the offensive with major advances.

Governor Barbachano sought allies anywhere he could find them, in Cuba (for Spain), Jamaica (for the United Kingdom) and the United States, but none of these foreign powers would intervene, although the matter was taken seriously enough in the United States to be debated in Congress. Subsequently, therefore, he turned to Mexico, and accepted a return to Mexican authority. Yucatán was officially reunited with Mexico on 17 August 1848. Yucateco forces rallied, aided by fresh guns, money, and troops from Mexico, and pushed back the natives from more than half of the state.

By 1850, the natives occupied two distinct regions in the southeast and they were inspired to continue the struggle by the apparition of the &quot;Talking Cross&quot;. This apparition, believed to be a way in which God communicated with the Maya, dictated that the War continue. Chan Santa Cruz, or Small Holy Cross became the religious and political center of the Maya resistance and the rebellion came to be infused with religious significance. Chan Santa Cruz also became the name of the largest of the independent Maya states, as well as the name of the capital city which is now the city of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo. The followers of the Cross were known as the &quot;Cruzob&quot;.

The government of Yucatán first declared the war over in 1855, but hopes for peace were premature. There were regular skirmishes, and occasional deadly major assaults into each other&#x27;s territory, by both sides. The United Kingdom recognized the Chan Santa Cruz Maya as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent nation, in part because of the major trade between Chan Santa Cruz and British Honduras.

=== Brief exile to Mexico ===
During the first term as president, Carrera had brought the country back from extreme conservatism to a traditional moderation and kept a stable relationship among the natives, the &quot;criollos&quot;—who at the time were terrified of the Caste War in Yucatán—and himself; but in 1848, the liberals were able to drive him from office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months. Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for México. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law ordering Carrera&#x27;s execution if he dared to return to Guatemalan soil. The liberal criollos from Quetzaltenango were led by general Agustín Guzmán who occupied the city after Corregidor general Mariano Paredes was called to Guatemala City to take over the presidential office. They declared on 26 August 1848 that Los Altos was an independent state once again. The new state had the support of Vasconcelos&#x27; regime in El Salvador and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were sworn enemies of Carrera. The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members. On 5 September 1848, the criollos altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez.

=== Back to Guatemala ===

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so entering by Huehuetenango, where he met with the native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera&#x27;s leadership. In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president Mariano Rivera Paz and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.

When Carrera arrived to Chiantla in Huehuetenango, he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control. The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of Miguel Garcia Granados – who arrived from Guatemala City were looking for him.

On learning that officer José Víctor Zavala had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.

Guzmán went to Antigua Guatemala to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean. Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies had occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as Corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the k&#x27;iche&#x27;, mam, q&#x27;anjobal and mam leaders to keep the region under control. On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed!

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while Luis Batres Juarros convinced president Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in Guatemala City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the Indian communities from the densely populated western highlands. During the first presidency from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and – with the advice of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and Pedro de Aycinena – restored relations with the Church in Rome with a Concordat ratified in 1854.

== Second Presidency ==

=== Battle of La Arada ===

After Carrera returned from exile in 1849, Vasconcelos granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different forms: José Francisco Barrundia did it through a liberal newspaper established with that specific goal; Vasconcelos gave support during a whole year to a rebel faction &quot;La Montaña&quot;, in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting Honduras and Nicaragua to participate in the alliance; only the Honduran government led by Juan Lindo accepted.

Meanwhile, in Guatemala, where the invasion plans were perfectly well known, President Mariano Paredes started taking precautions to face the situation, while the Guatemalan Archbishop, Francisco de Paula García Peláez, ordered peace prayers in the archdiocese.

On 4 January 1851, Doroteo Vasconcelos and Juan Lindo met in Ocotepeque, Honduras, where they signed an alliance against Guatemala. The Salvadorean army had 4,000 men, properly trained and armed and supported by artillery; the Honduran army numbered 2,000 men. The coalition army was stationed in Metapán, El Salvador, due to its proximity with both the Guatemalan and Honduran borders.

On 28 January 1851, Vasconcelos sent a letter to the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Relations, in which he demanded that the Guatemalan president relinquish power, so that the alliance could designate a new head of state loyal to the liberals and that Carrera be exiled, escorted to any of the Guatemalan southern ports by a Salvadorean regiment. The Guatemalan government did not accept the terms and the Allied army entered Guatemalan territory at three different places. On 29 January, a 500-man contingent entered through Piñuelas, Agua Blanca and Jutiapa, led by General Vicente Baquero, but the majority of the invading force marched from Metapán. The Allied army was composed of 4,500 men led by Vasconcelos, as Commander in Chief. Other commanders were the generals José Santos Guardiola, Ramón Belloso, José Trinidad Cabañas and Gerardo Barrios. Guatemala was able to recruit 2,000 men, led by Lieutenant General Carrera as Commander in Chief, with several colonels.

Carrera&#x27;s strategy was to feign a retreat, forcing the enemy forces to follow the &quot;retreating&quot; troops to a place he had previously chosen; on February 1, 1851, both armies were facing each other with only the San José river between them. Carrera had fortified the foothills of La Arada, its summit about above the level of the river. A meadow deep lay between the hill and the river, and boarding the meadow was a sugar cane plantation. Carrera divided his army in three sections: the left wing was led by Cerna and Solares; the right wing led by Bolaños. He personally led the central battalion, where he placed his artillery. Five hundred men stayed in Chiquimula to defend the city and to aid in a possible retreat, leaving only 1,500 Guatemalans against an enemy of 4,500.

The battle began at 8:30 AM, when Allied troops initiated an attack at three different points, with an intense fire opened by both armies. The first Allied attack was repelled by the defenders of the foothill; during the second attack, the Allied troops were able to take the first line of trenches. They were subsequently expelled. During the third attack, the Allied force advanced to a point where it was impossible to distinguish between Guatemalan and Allied troops. Then, the fight became a melée, while the Guatemalan artillery severely punished the invaders. At the height of the battle when the Guatemalans faced an uncertain fate, Carrera ordered that sugar cane plantation around the meadow to be set on fire. The invading army was now surrounded: to the front, they faced the furious Guatemalan firepower, to the flanks, a huge blaze and to the rear, the river, all of which made retreat very difficult. The central division of the Allied force panicked and started a disorderly retreat. Soon, all of the Allied troops started retreating.

The 500 men of the rearguard pursued what was left of the Allied army, which desperately fled for the borders of their respective countries. The final count of the Allied losses were 528 dead, 200 prisoners, 1,000 rifles, 13,000 rounds of ammunition, many pack animals and baggage, 11 drums and seven artillery pieces. Vasconcelos sought refuge in El Salvador, while two Generals mounted on the same horse were seen crossing the Honduran border. Carrera regrouped his army and crossed the Salvadorean border, occupying Santa Ana, before he received orders from the Guatemalan President, Mariano Paredes, to return to Guatemala, since the Allies were requesting a cease-fire and a peace treaty.

=== Carrera Theater ===


An enthusiastic fan of opera, and following the advice of his mistress – Josefa Silva&#x27;s-, Carrera started the construction of a massive National Theater that was called «Carrera Theater» in his honor, and was located in the old Central Square. The Old Central Square was located to the northeast side of Guatemala City – then not larger than a village – and in 1776 was used to place the first block of the new Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción after the 1773 earthquakes destroy Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. The place had been chosen as the new city Central Square, saving the surroundings for the new Cathedral, Palace and houses for the richest families of the time, the Aycinena family, given that the family leader, Fermín de Aycinena, contributed considerably to the move of the city from its old place. However, the design approved by the Spanish crown had the Central Square in a different location, and this one became the Old Central Square.

Years later it became a commercial site and on August 6, 1832, then State of Guatemala Governor, Dr. Mariano Gálvez, issued a decree to build a theater in the Old Central Square site. However, political climate was very tense in the country and when the civil war between liberal and conservative parties escalated, Gálvez was overthrown and the theater could not be built.

The project was revisited in 1852, when Juan Matheu and Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena presented Carrera with a new plan. Once approved, Carrera commissioned Matheu himself and Miguel Ruiz de Santisteban to build the theater. Initially it was in charge of engineer Miguel Rivera Maestre, but he quit after a few months and was replaced by German expert José Beckers, who built the Greek façades and added a lobby. This was the first monumental building ever built in the Republican era of Guatemala, a sign that in the 1850s the country was finally enjoying some peace and prosperity.

=== Concordat of 1854 ===

The Concordat of 1854 was an international treaty between Carrera and the Holy See, signed in 1852 and ratified by both parties in 1854. Through this, Guatemala gave the education of Guatemalan people to regular orders of the Catholic Church, committed to respect ecclesiastical property and monasteries, imposed mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what was published in the country; in return, Guatemala received dispensations for the members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the liberals had expropriated from the Church in 1829 to keep those properties, received the taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right to judge certain crimes committed by clergy under Guatemalan law. The concordat was designed by Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and not only reestablished but reinforced the relationship between Church and State in Guatemala. It was in force until the fall of the conservative government of Field Marshal Vicente Cerna y Cerna.

=== President for life ===

In 1854, by anti-democratic initiative of Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena, Carrera was declared &quot;supreme and perpetual leader of the nation&quot; for life, with the power to choose his successor. He was in that position until he died on April 14, 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and in a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency. His rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in the War of 1863. At Coatepeque the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied San Salvador, and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the Clerical Party, and tried to maintain friendly relations with the European governments. Before his death, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall Vicente Cerna y Cerna, as his successor.

=== Wyke-Aycinena treaty: Limits convention about Belize ===

The Belize region in the Yucatán Peninsula was long occupied by the Maya peoples but neglected by Spain and Guatemala, even though Spain made some exploratory expeditions in the 16th century that serve as her basis to claim the area as hers; Guatemala simply inherited that argument to claim the territory, even they never sent any expedition to the area after the Independence from Spain in 1821, due to the Central American civil war that ensued and lasted until 1860. On the other hand, slaves escaped from Caribbean island and pirates had set a small settlement there since middle of the 17th century, mainly as buccaneers quarters and then for fine wood production; the settlements were never recognized as British colonies, even though they were somewhat under the jurisdiction of the Jamaican British government. In the 18th century, Belize became the main smuggling center for Central America, even though the British accepted Spanish sovereignty over the region by means of treaties in 1783 and 1786, in exchange for a ceasefire and the authorization for the Britons to work with the precious woods from Belize.

After the Central America independence from Spain in 1821, Belize became the leading edge of the commercial entrance of Britain in the isthmus; British commercial brokers established themselves there and began prosper commercial routes with the Caribbean harbors of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.

When Carrera came to power in 1840, stopped the complaints over Belize, and established a Guatemalan consulate in the region to oversee the Guatemalan interests in that important commercial location. Belize commerce was booming in the region until 1855, when the Colombians built a transoceanic railway, which allowed commerce to flow more efficiently to the port at the Pacific; from then on, Belize commercial importance began a steep decline. When the Caste War of Yucatán began in the Yucatán Peninsula-native people raising that results in thousands of murdered European settlers- the Belize and Guatemala representatives were in high alert; Yucatan refugees fled into both Guatemala and Belize and even Belize superintendent came to fear that Carrera -given his strong alliance with Guatemalan natives- could be support the native risings in Central America. In the 1850s, the British showed their good will to settle the territorial differences with the Central American countries: they withdrew from the Mosquito Coast in Nicaragua and began talks that would end up in the restoration of the territory to Nicaragua in 1894: returned the Bay Islands to Honduras and even negotiated with the American filibuster William Walker in an effort to avoid the invasion of Honduras. They also signed a treaty about with Guatemala about Belize borders, which has been called by Guatemalans as the worst mistake made by the unelected regime of Rafael Carrera-.

Pedro de Aycinena y Piñol, as Foreign Secretary, had made an extra effort to keep good relations with the British crown. In 1859, William Walker&#x27;s threat loomed again over Central America; in order to get the weapons needed to face the filibuster, Carrera&#x27;s regime had to come to terms about Belize with the British Empire. On 30 April 1859, the Wyke-Aycinena treaty was signed, between the British and Guatemalan representatives. The controversial Wyke-Aycinena from 1859 had two parts:

* The first six articles clearly defined the Guatemala-Belize border: Guatemala acknowledged sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Belize territory.
* The seventh article was about the construction of a road between Belize City and Guatemala City, which would be of mutual benefic, as Belize needed a way to communicate with the Pacific coast of Guatemala, having lost its commercial relevance after the construction of the transoceanic railroad in Panama in 1855; on the other hand, Guatemala needed a road to improve communication with its Atlantic coast. However, the road was never built; first because Guatemalan and Belizeans could not reach an agreement of the exact location for the road, and later because the conservatives lost power in Guatemala in 1871, and the liberal government declared the treaty void.

Among those who signed the treaty was José Milla y Vidaurre, who worked with Aycinena in the Foreign Ministry at the time. Rafael Carrera ratified the treaty on 1 May 1859, while Charles Lennox Wyke, British consul in Guatemala, travelled to Great Britain and got the royal approval on 26 September 1859. there were some protests coming from the American consul, Beverly Clarke, and some liberal representatives, but the issue was settled.

==Death==
Rafael Carrera died in office April 14, 1865.

== Legacy ==
Carrera did not significantly enhance the life of rural Indians, but he delayed the destruction of their culture that characterized the liberals&#x27; capitalist developments. Carrera&#x27;s regime established the foundations of all following government, including &quot;economic control by unified elites, the military as the Latinos&#x27; means of social mobility, and even the alienation of Indian land and labor.&quot; His success was the result of his military brilliance, charisma, and his ability to quickly identify core issues and problems. His rule may have been arbitrary and severe, but not more so than that of other Latin American leaders.

Pope Pius IX awarded Carrera the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1854. One year after his death, coins were issued in his honor with his face and the title: “Founder of the Republic of Guatemala.”

<text>The masked shrike (Lanius nubicus) is a species of bird in the shrike family, Laniidae. It breeds in southeastern Europe and at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, with a separate population in eastern Iraq and western Iran. It is migratory, wintering mainly in northeast Africa. Although it is a short-range migrant, vagrants have occurred widely elsewhere, including northern and western Europe. It is the smallest member of its genus, long-tailed and with a hooked bill. The male has mainly black upperparts, with white on its crown, forehead and supercilium and large white patches on the shoulders and wings. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange flanks and breast. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with a paler forehead and barring from the head to rump, barred off-white underparts and brown wings аpart from the white primary patches. The species&#x27; calls are short and grating, but the song has melodic warbler-like components.

The masked shrike&#x27;s preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup built in a tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20 days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing in parts of the European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy==
The shrikes are a family of slender, long-tailed passerines, most of its members being in the genus &quot;Lanius&quot;, the typical shrikes. They are short-necked birds with rounded wings and a hooked tip to the bill. Most occur in open habitats. The affiliations of the masked shrike with other members of the genus are uncertain; the &quot;brown&quot; shrikes (brown, red-backed and isabelline shrikes) and tropical species like the Somali fiscal have both been suggested as possible relatives. The masked shrike has no subspecies.

The masked shrike was described by German explorer and naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823 under its current scientific name. &quot;Lanius&quot; is the Latin for a butcher, and comes from the shrikes&#x27; habit of impaling prey, reminiscent of a butcher hanging carcasses, and &quot;nubicus&quot; means &quot;Nubian&quot; (from northeast Africa). The bird was independently described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Temminck in 1824 as &quot;Lanius personatus&quot;, from the Latin &quot;personatus&quot; &quot;masked&quot;, referring, as does the English name, to the bird&#x27;s appearance, but the older name takes precedence. A later synonym from 1844 was &quot;L. leucometopon&quot; from the Greek &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;metopon&quot;, &quot;forehead&quot;, describing a feature of the distinctive head pattern. &quot;Shrike&quot;, first recorded in 1545, derives from the shrill cries given by this family, and the traditional common name &quot;butcher-bird&quot; again refers to the characteristic prey storage, and has been in use since at least 1668.

==Description==

The masked shrike is the smallest of its genus, a slender bird which usually weighs , measuring long with a wingspan. It has a long tail and relatively small bill, on each side of which is a tomial tooth; the upper mandible bears a triangular ridge which fits a corresponding notch in the lower mandible. This adaptation is otherwise only found in falcons.

The male has mainly black upperparts, a white crown, forehead and supercilium. There are large white patches on the shoulders and primaries, and the outermost tail feathers are also white. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange on the flanks and breast. The iris is brown, the bill is black and the legs are dark brown or black. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish-black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump, a paler grey forehead, barred off-white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches.

Masked shrikes are most similar in appearance to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults of the two species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.

Juveniles moult their head, body and some wing feathers a few weeks after fledging, and adults have a complete moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.

===Voice===
The masked shrike gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with repeated &quot;tsr&quot;, &quot;tzr&quot; or &quot;shek&quot; notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling &quot;krrrr&quot;. The bill may be snapped when the bird is agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of &quot;Hippolais&quot; species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.

In the film &quot;the Great Escape&quot;, the POWs were taught how to mimic the masked shrike&#x27;s call.

==Distribution and habitat==

The masked shrike breeds in the Balkans and Western Asia: southern Bulgaria, eastern Republic of North Macedonia, northeast Greece and some of the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is migratory, wintering south of the Sahara, mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.

This species is seen in Egypt, Jordan and Israel much more often in spring than autumn, suggesting that the southern movement may be concentrated further east. Birds will hold small territories on about on migration, and, unlike other shrikes, may congregate in significant numbers. More than 100 have been seen in one locality in Israel, with five in a single bush. This shrike has occurred as a vagrant in Algeria, Finland, Kenya, Libya, Spain, Sweden, Mauritania and Turkmenistan. At least three individuals have been documented in Great Britain, and two individuals in Armenia.

The masked shrike&#x27;s preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees. Unlike its relatives, it avoids very open, lightly vegetated country. Orchards and other cultivated land with suitable old trees or large hedges are also used by this species. It is normally found in more wooded areas than sympatric shrikes. It occurs in lowlands and in hills up to . In some areas breeding occurs at greater altitudes, up to . It may occur in gardens and resorts on migration, and in winter again prefers open country with thorny bushes and large trees like acacia or introduced eucalyptus.

==Behaviour==
The masked shrike is a solitary species except when on migration. It maintains a breeding territory of and is also territorial on the wintering grounds, defending an area of about . Although unafraid of humans, it is aggressive to its own species and other birds which infringe on its territory. Most other shrikes use high, exposed branches throughout the year, but the masked shrike only uses conspicuous locations at the start of the breeding season, otherwise choosing lower, more sheltered spots. It perches upright, frequently cocking its tail, and has an easy, agile flight. A masked shrike has been recorded as feigning injury when trapped, only to return to normal when the threat receded.

===Breeding===
Male masked shrikes sing from perches in their territories from early April, sometimes chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male&#x27;s courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, starts with the bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and is followed by the shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.

The nest, built by both sexes, is a small, neat cup of rootlets, stems and twigs, lined with wool or hair, and adorned with lichen externally. It is constructed in a tree above the ground and averages wide and deep, with the cup across and a in depth. Eggs are laid from April to June, mainly in May in the lowlands and about a month later in the mountains. Replacement clutches are laid in June or July if the nest fails, and second broods appear to be common in at least some areas. The first nest is destroyed by the pair to provide material for a replacement breeding attempt. The eggs average in size and are variable in colour, with a background of grey, cream or yellow, diffuse grey blotches, and a ring of brown markings. The normal clutch is 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The altricial downy chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20 days later. They are dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike breeds in its first year, but its average life span is unknown.

Vertebrate predators of young birds include cats and crows. This species may also be infected by parasites, such as a tick, &quot;Hyalomma marginatum&quot;, and at least two species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; blood parasites.

===Feeding===
Like its relatives, the masked shrike hunts from a perch, typically high, although usually in less exposed locations than those favoured by most other shrikes. Prey is usually taken from the ground, but occasionally picked off foliage or caught in the air with an agile flycatcher-like flight. The kill may be impaled on thorns or barbed wire as a &quot;larder&quot; for immediate or later consumption. Because passerines have relatively weak legs, impalement holds the corpse while it is dismembered. It was once thought that this behaviour was shown mainly by male shrikes in the breeding season, but this is not the case. Masked shrikes of both sexes are known to impale in winter and on migration. Individual birds may be very tame, following a gardener or feeding close to an observer.

The masked shrike feeds mainly on large insects, although other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, but to a lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows to the back of the head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.

==Status==

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates the European population of the masked shrike to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and extensive breeding range of about , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.

Numbers have declined in recent decades in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel is thought to be due to pesticides. In Somalia, this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.

<doc id="614169" wikidata="Q156243" url="?curid=614169" title="Sinuiju">
<text>Sinŭiju (; ) is a city in North Korea which faces Dandong, Liaoning, China, across the international border of the Yalu River. It is the capital of North P&#x27;yŏngan province. Part of the city is included in the Sinŭiju Special Administrative Region, which was established in 2002 to experiment with introducing a market economy. In recent years, the city, despite lagging behind the development in the capital Pyongyang, has seen a small construction boom and increasing tourism from China.

==Geography==

Sinŭiju is bordered by the Amnok River, and by P&#x27;ihyŏn and Ryongch&#x27;ŏn counties. The city&#x27;s altitude is 1 metre (4 feet) above sea level. There are several islands at the mouth of the Amnok River - Wihwa-do, Rim-do, Ryuch&#x27;o-do and Tongryuch&#x27;o-do.

==Administrative divisions==
Sinuiju city is the heart of the Sinuiju Special Administrative Region. The city is currently divided into 49 &quot;tong&quot; (neighbourhoods) and 9 &quot;ri&quot; (villages):

== History ==
Developed as a major settlement during the colonial rule at the terminus of a railway bridge across the Amrok River, Sinuiju is located 11 km (7 miles) south by southwest of Ŭiju, the old city from whose name Sinŭiju (meaning “New Ŭiju”) derives. As an open port, it grew commercially with the logging industry which uses the Amnok River to transport lumber. Additionally, a chemical industry developed after the hydroelectric Sup&#x27;ung Dam was built further up the river.

In the course of the Korean War, after being driven from P&#x27;yŏngyang, Kim Il Sung and his government temporarily moved its capital to Sinŭiju - although as UNC forces approached, the government again moved - this time to Kanggye. Also, the city sustained heavy damage from aerial bombardment as part of the United States Air Force&#x27;s strategic bombing of North Korea; 95 percent of the city was destroyed. However, the city has since been rebuilt.

In 2018, a master plan for the redevelopment of the city was unveiled and shown to Kim Jong Un, which would have featured many high rise buildings and parks, centered around the road leading to the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Ultimately, this plan has yet to be fulfilled, with the only major work completed being the repaving of roads leading to the statues and the red coloured, circular apartment building behind and the Sinuiju Youth Open Air Theatre&#x27;s completion, although the industrial areas in the city have seen some reconstruction.

==Economy==

An important light industry centre in North Korea, Sinŭiju has a plant manufacturing enamelled ironware as well as a textile mill, paper mill and an afforestation factory. Its southwest harbour has a shipyard, although the shipyard&#x27;s main function is seemingly to dismantle ships for scrap metal and other usable materials rather than building new ships. The area has recycling plants which recycle a wide range of material, including products that are banned for recycling in China. The Sinŭiju Cosmetics Factory is located in South Sinŭiju (Namsinŭiju).

===Trade with China===
A substantial portion of North Korea&#x27;s international trade, both legal and illegal, passes through Sinuiju and Dandong, across the Yalu River.

===Central market===
Since 2002, commercial life has been centred on the Chaeha-dong Market. Based on a satellite image taken on 30 October 2012, the market has been destroyed and is being made into a new park.

==Transportation==

Sinŭiju can be reached from P&#x27;yŏngyang by air, railway and road. It can be reached from Dandong in China by crossing the Amnok River by bridge or boat. Foreign tourists on excursion boats from Dandong are sometimes permitted to approach within a few meters of the city&#x27;s coastline, as long as they do not land.

===Air===
Sinŭiju&#x27;s airport has a single turf runway 03/21 measuring 991 metres by 61 metres (3250 feet by 213 feet). Air Koryŏ operates passenger and cargo flights from P&#x27;yŏngyang.

===Rail===
Sinŭiju Ch&#x27;ŏngnyŏn Station is the northern terminus of the Korean State Railway&#x27;s P&#x27;yŏngŭi Line from P&#x27;yŏngyang; the district is also served by several other stations on the P&#x27;yŏngŭi line, as well as the Tŏkhyŏn and Paengma lines. It is also connected with the Chinese city of Dandong in Liaoning Province (China) by the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, which is long from end to end, and through the Manchuria Railway links up with the Trans-Siberian railway. The factories of the city of Sinŭiju are provided with railway service via the Kang&#x27;an Line.

=== Urban transit ===
Sinuiju has a trolleybus line that runs from the city centre to the railway station. It was reopened in October 2020 with new trolleybuses derived from the Pyongyang Chollima-321 trolleybus. It formerly had another line running from the Sinuiju Chongnyon Station to Ragwon Machine Complex that closed between 2005 and 2009 with the reconstruction of the highway with a shifted alignment.

== Climate ==
Sinŭiju has a monsoonal humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) with hot, humid and stormy summers and cold, dry winters with little snowfall.

==Places of interest==

Facilities in Sinŭiju include Sinŭiju High School, Sinŭiju Commercial High School, Eastern Middle School, Sinŭiju Light Industry University, Sinŭiju University of Medicine and the Sinuiju University of Education. Scenic sites include the Tonggun Pavilion, Waterfall, and Hot Springs.

There also is a Ferris wheel overlooking the Yalu River, reportedly broken.

<text>A voltage-controlled filter (VCF) is an electronic filter whose operating characteristics (primarily cutoff frequency) can be set by an input control voltage. Voltage-controlled filters are widely used in synthesizers.

A music synthesizer VCF allows its cutoff frequency, and sometimes its Q factor (resonance at the cutoff frequency), to be continuously varied. The filter outputs often include a lowpass response, and sometimes highpass, bandpass or notch responses.
Some musical VCFs offer a variable &quot;slope&quot; which determines the rate of attenuation outside the bandpass, often at 6 dB/octave, 12 dB/octave, 18 dB/octave or 24 dB/octave (one-, two-, three- and four-pole filters, respectively).
In modular analog synthesizers, VCFs receive signal input from signal sources, including oscillators and noise, or the output of other processors. By varying the cutoff frequency, the filter passes or attenuates partials of the input signal.

In some popular electronic music styles, &quot;filter sweeps&quot; have become a common effect. These sweeps are created by varying the cutoff frequency of the VCF (sometimes very slowly). Controlling the cutoff by means of a transient voltage control, such as an envelope generator, especially with relatively fast attack settings, may simulate the attack transients of natural or acoustic instruments.

Historically, musical VCFs have included variable feedback which creates a response peak (Q) at the cutoff frequency. This peak can be quite prominent, and when the filter&#x27;s frequency is swept by a control, partials present in the input signal resonate. Some filters are designed to provide enough feedback to go into self-oscillation, and it can serve as a sine-wave source.

ARP Instruments made a multifunction voltage-controlled filter module capable of stable operation at a Q over 100; it could be shock-excited to ring like a vibraphone bar. Q was voltage-controllable, in part by a panel-mounted control. Its internal circuit was a classic analog computer state variable &quot;loop&quot;, which provided outputs in quadrature.

A VCF is an example of an active non-linear filter. The characteristic musical sound of a particular VCF depends on both its linear (small-signal) frequency response and its non-linear response to larger amplitude inputs.

<doc id="614192" wikidata="Q1476020" url="?curid=614192" title="Paschen's law">
<text>Paschen&#x27;s law is an equation that gives the breakdown voltage, that is, the voltage necessary to start a discharge or electric arc, between two electrodes in a gas as a function of pressure and gap length. It is named after Friedrich Paschen who discovered it empirically in 1889.

Paschen studied the breakdown voltage of various gases between parallel metal plates as the gas pressure and gap distance were varied:
* With a constant gap length, the voltage necessary to arc across the gap decreased as the pressure was reduced and then increased gradually, exceeding its original value. 
* With a constant pressure, the voltage needed to cause an arc reduced as the gap size was reduced but only to a point. As the gap was reduced further, the voltage required to cause an arc began to rise and again exceeded its original value.

For a given gas, the voltage is a function only of the product of the pressure and gap length. The curve he found of voltage versus the pressure-gap length product &quot;(right)&quot; is called Paschen&#x27;s curve. He found an equation that fit these curves, which is now called Paschen&#x27;s law.

At higher pressures and gap lengths, the breakdown voltage is approximately &quot;proportional&quot; to the product of pressure and gap length, and the term Paschen&#x27;s law is sometimes used to refer to this simpler relation. However, this is only roughly true, over a limited range of the curve.

==Paschen curve==
Early vacuum experimenters found a rather surprising behavior. An arc would sometimes take place in a long irregular path rather than at the minimal distance between the electrodes. For example, in air, at a pressure of one atmosphere, the distance for minimal breakdown voltage is about 7.5 μm. The voltage required to arc this distance is 327 V, which is insufficient to ignite the arcs for gaps that are either wider or narrower. For a 3.5 μm gap, the required voltage is 533 V, nearly twice as much. If 500 V were applied, it would not be sufficient to arc at the 2.85 μm distance, but would arc at a 7.5 μm distance.

Paschen found that breakdown voltage was described by the equation

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the breakdown voltage in volts, formula_3 is the pressure in pascals, formula_4 is the gap distance in meters, formula_5 is the secondary-electron-emission coefficient (the number of secondary electrons produced per incident positive ion), formula_6 is the saturation ionization in the gas at a particular formula_7 (electric field/pressure), and formula_8 is related to the excitation and ionization energies.

The constants formula_6 and formula_8 interpolate the first Townsend coefficient formula_11. They are determined experimentally and found to be roughly constant over a restricted range of formula_7 for any given gas. For example, air with an formula_7 in the range of 450 to 7500 V/(kPa·cm), formula_6 = 112.50 (kPa·cm)−1 and formula_8 = 2737.50 V/(kPa·cm).

The graph of this equation is the Paschen curve. By differentiating it with respect to formula_16 and setting the derivative to zero, the minimal voltage can be found. This yields

: formula_17

and predicts the occurrence of a minimal breakdown voltage for formula_16 = 7.5×10−6 m·atm. This is 327 V in air at standard atmospheric pressure at a distance of 7.5 μm.

The composition of the gas determines both the minimal arc voltage and the distance at which it occurs. For argon, the minimal arc voltage is 137 V at a larger 12 μm. For sulfur dioxide, the minimal arc voltage is 457 V at only 4.4 μm.

===Long gaps===
For air at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP), the voltage needed to arc a 1-metre gap is about 3.4 MV. The intensity of the electric field for this gap is therefore 3.4 MV/m.

The electric field needed to arc across the minimal-voltage gap is much greater than what is necessary to arc a gap of one metre. At large gaps (or large pd) Paschen&#x27;s Law is known to fail. The Meek Criteria for breakdown is usually used for large gaps.

It takes into account non-uniformity in the electric field and formation of streamers due to the build up of charge within the gap that can occur over long distances. For a 7.5 μm gap the arc voltage is 327 V, which is 43 MV/m. This is about 14 times greater than the field strength for the 1.5-metre gap. The phenomenon is well verified experimentally and is referred to as the Paschen minimum.

The equation loses accuracy for gaps under about 10 μm in air at one atmosphere
and incorrectly predicts an infinite arc voltage at a gap of about 2.7 μm. Breakdown voltage can also differ from the Paschen curve prediction for very small electrode gaps, when field emission from the cathode surface becomes important.

==Physical mechanism==
The mean free path of a molecule in a gas is the average distance between its collision with other molecules. This is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas, given constant temperature. In air at STP the mean free path of molecules is about 96 nm. Since electrons are much smaller, their average distance between colliding with molecules is about 5.6 times longer, or about 0.5 μm. This is a substantial fraction of the 7.5 μm spacing between the electrodes for minimal arc voltage. If the electron is in an electric field of 43 MV/m, it will be accelerated and acquire 21.5 eV of energy in 0.5 μm of travel in the direction of the field. The first ionization energy needed to dislodge an electron from nitrogen molecule is about 15.6 eV. The accelerated electron will acquire more than enough energy to ionize a nitrogen molecule. This liberated electron will in turn be accelerated, which will lead to another collision. A chain reaction then leads to avalanche breakdown, and an arc takes place from the cascade of released electrons.

More collisions will take place in the electron path between the electrodes in a higher-pressure gas. When the pressure–gap product formula_16 is high, an electron will collide with many different gas molecules as it travels from the cathode to the anode. Each of the collisions randomizes the electron direction, so the electron is not always being accelerated by the electric field—sometimes it travels back towards the cathode and is decelerated by the field.

Collisions reduce the electron&#x27;s energy and make it more difficult for it to ionize a molecule. Energy losses from a greater number of collisions require larger voltages for the electrons to accumulate sufficient energy to ionize many gas molecules, which is required to produce an avalanche breakdown.

On the left side of the Paschen minimum, the formula_16 product is small. The electron mean free path can become long compared to the gap between the electrodes. In this case, the electrons might gain large amounts of energy, but have fewer ionizing collisions. A greater voltage is therefore required to assure ionization of enough gas molecules to start an avalanche.

== Derivation ==

=== Basics ===
To calculate the breakthrough voltage, a homogeneous electrical field is assumed. This is the case in a parallel-plate capacitor setup. The electrodes may have the distance formula_4. The cathode is located at the point formula_22.

To get impact ionization, the electron energy formula_23 must become greater than the ionization energy formula_24 of the gas atoms between the plates. Per length of path formula_25 a number of formula_26 ionizations will occur. formula_26 is known as the first Townsend coefficient as it was introduced by Townsend.

The increase of the electron current formula_28, can be described for the assumed setup as

(So the number of free electrons at the anode is equal to the number of free electrons at the cathode that were multiplied by impact ionization. The larger formula_4 and/or formula_26, the more free electrons are created.)

The number of created electrons is

Neglecting possible multiple ionizations of the same atom, the number of created ions is the same as the number of created electrons:

formula_31 is the ion current. To keep the discharge going on, free electrons must be created at the cathode surface. This is possible because the ions hitting the cathode release secondary electrons at the impact. (For very large applied voltages also field electron emission can occur.) Without field emission, we can write

where formula_32 is the mean number of generated secondary electrons per ion. This is also known as the second Townsend coefficient. Assuming that formula_33, one gets the relation between the Townsend coefficients by putting () into () and transforming:

=== Impact ionization ===
What is the amount of formula_26? The number of ionization depends upon the probability that an electron hits a gas molecule. This probability formula_35 is the relation of the cross-sectional area of a collision between electron and ion formula_36 in relation to the overall area formula_6 that is available for the electron to fly through:

As expressed by the second part of the equation, it is also possible to express the probability as relation of the path traveled by the electron formula_25 to the mean free path formula_39 (distance at which another collision occurs).

formula_40 is the number of molecules which electrons can hit. It can be calculated using the equation of state of the ideal gas
:

The adjoining sketch illustrates that formula_41. As the radius of an electron can be neglected compared to the radius of an ion formula_42 it simplifies to formula_43. Using this relation, putting () into () and transforming to formula_39 one gets

=\frac{1}{L\cdot p} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the factor formula_45 was only introduced for a better overview.

The alteration of the current of not yet collided electrons at every point in the path formula_25 can be expressed as

This differential equation can easily be solved:

The probability that formula_47 (that there was not yet a collision at the point formula_25) is

According to its definition formula_26 is the number of ionizations per length of path and thus the relation of the probability that there was no collision in the mean free path of the ions, and the mean free path of the electrons:

{\lambda_{e}}\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda_e}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{I}}{E_{e}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

It was hereby considered that the energy formula_50 that a charged particle can get between a collision depends on the electric field strength formula_51 and the charge formula_52:

=== Breakdown voltage ===
For the parallel-plate capacitor we have formula_53, where formula_54 is the applied voltage. As a single ionization was assumed formula_52 is the elementary charge formula_56. We can now put () and () into () and get

{eU}\right)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Putting this into (5) and transforming to formula_54 we get the Paschen law for the breakdown voltage formula_58 that was first investigated by Paschen in

and whose formula was first derived by Townsend in
=\frac{L\cdot p\cdot d\cdot E_{I}}{e\left(\ln(L\cdot p\cdot d)-\ln\left(\ln\left(1+\gamma^{-1}\right)\right)\right)}\qquad\qquad(15)&lt;/math&gt;|}}
: formula_59

=== Plasma ignition ===
Plasma ignition in the definition of Townsend (Townsend discharge) is a self-sustaining discharge, independent of an external source of free electrons. This means that electrons from the cathode can reach the anode in the distance formula_4 and ionize at least one atom on their way. So according to the definition of formula_26 this relation must be fulfilled:

If formula_62 is used instead of () one gets for the breakdown voltage

 = \frac{L\cdot p\cdot d\cdot E_{I}}{e\cdot \ln(L\cdot p\cdot d)} = \frac{d\cdot E_{I}}{e\cdot \lambda_e\,\ln\left(\frac{d}{\lambda_e}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

== Conclusions, validity ==
Paschen&#x27;s law requires that:
* There are already free electrons at the cathode (formula_63) which can be accelerated to trigger impact ionization. Such so-called &quot;seed electrons&quot; can be created by ionization by natural radioactivity or cosmic rays.
* The creation of further free electrons is only achieved by impact ionization. Thus Paschen&#x27;s law is not valid if there are external electron sources. This can, for example, be a light source creating secondary electrons by the photoelectric effect. This has to be considered in experiments.
* Each ionized atom leads to only one free electron. However, multiple ionizations occur always in practice.
* Free electrons at the cathode surface are created by the impacting ions. The problem is that the number of thereby created electrons strongly depends on the material of the cathode, its surface (roughness, impurities) and the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity etc.). The experimental, reproducible determination of the factor formula_32 is therefore nearly impossible.
* The electrical field is homogeneous.

==Effects with different gases==
Different gases will have different mean free paths for molecules and electrons. This is because different molecules have ionization cross sections, that is, different effective diameters. Noble gases like helium and argon are monatomic, which makes them harder to ionize and tend to have smaller effective diameters. This gives them greater mean free paths.

Ionization potentials differ between molecules, as well as the speed that they recapture electrons after they have been knocked out of orbit. All three effects change the number of collisions needed to cause an exponential growth in free electrons. These free electrons are necessary to cause an arc.

<text>USS &quot;Sacagawea&quot; (YT/YTM-326) was built in 1925, and acquired by the United States Navy from Brazil in 1942 as &quot;Almirante Noronha&quot;. She is one of the few US Naval vessels named for a woman. Sacagawea was a guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

==Service history==
She was renamed &quot;Sacagawea&quot; on 1 September 1942 and was placed in service as a harbor tug at Charleston, South Carolina, upon her delivery on 30 September.

Reclassified YTM-326 on 15 May 1944, she served at Charleston until she was placed out of service and struck from the Navy list on 22 June 1945. &quot;Sacagawea&quot; was then turned over to the State Department for disposal and was sold to foreign purchasers in May 1946.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to classical architecture:

[[Classical architecture]] – architecture of classical antiquity, that is, ancient Greek architecture and the architecture of ancient Rome. It also refers to the style or styles of architecture influenced by those. For example, most of the styles originating in post-Renaissance Europe can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir John Summerson in &quot;The Classical Language of Architecture&quot;.

== What type of thing is classical architecture? ==
Classical architecture can be described as all of the following:

* Architecture – both the process and product of planning, designing and construction. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
** Architectural style – classification of architecture in terms of the use of form, techniques, materials, time period, region and other stylistic influences.
* Art – aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word &quot;art&quot; is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term &quot;classical architecture&quot;.
** One of the arts – as an art form, classical architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Classical architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the visual arts – visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
* Form of classicism – high regard in the arts for classical antiquity, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate.
** Classicism in architecture – places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.

== Classical architectural structures ==
=== Ancient Greek architectural structures ===
Ancient Greek architecture – architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland and Peloponnesus, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Asia Minor and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. Ancient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, and the Parthenon is a prime example.

=== Ancient Roman architectural structures ===
Ancient Roman architecture – the Roman architectural revolution, also known as the concrete revolution, was the widespread use in Roman architecture of the previously little-used architectural forms of the arch, vault, and dome. A crucial factor in this development that saw a trend to monumental architecture was the invention of Roman concrete (also called &quot;opus caementicium&quot;).

== Architectural styles ==
Architectural style
* Byzantine architecture – initially, the early Byzantine architecture was stylistically and structurally indistinguishable from earlier Roman architecture; the ancient ways of building lived on, but relatively soon the architecture developed into a distinct Byzantine style.
* Pre-Romanesque architecture –
* Romanesque architecture – Romanesque architecture is the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture. Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions, Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality.
* Gothic architecture – Gothic architecture (with which classical architecture is often posed), can incorporate classical elements and details, but does not to the same degree reflect a conscious effort to draw upon the architectural traditions of antiquity.
* Renaissance architecture – is a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts, as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. The classical architecture of the Renaissance from the outset represents a highly specific interpretation of the classical ideas.
* Palladian architecture – European style of architecture derived from the designs of the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). Palladio&#x27;s work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.
* Baroque architecture – Baroque and Rococo architecture are styles which, although classical at root, display an architectural language very much in their own right. Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic.
* Georgian architecture – set of architectural styles current between 1720 and 1840. In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world&#x27;s equivalent of European Rococo.
* Neoclassical architecture – architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century, manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulas as an outgrowth of some classicizing features of Late Baroque. In its purest form it is a style principally derived from the architecture of Classical Greece and the architecture of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.
** Empire style – sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts followed in Europe and America until around 1830, although in the U. S. it continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-19th century.
** Biedermeier architecture – neoclassical architecture in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848.
** Resort architecture (&quot;Bäderarchitektur&quot;) – a specific neoclassical style that came up at the end of the 18th century in German seaside resorts and is widely used in the region until today.
** Federal architecture – classicizing architecture built in the United States between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period.
** Regency architecture – buildings built in Britain during the period in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent, and also to later buildings following the same style. The style corresponds to the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States and to the French Empire style.
** Greek Revival architecture – architectural movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in Northern Europe and the United States. A product of Hellenism, it may be looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture.
** Beaux-Arts architecture – 
* Nordic Classicism – style of architecture that briefly blossomed in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) between 1910 and 1930.
* New Classical Architecture – architectural movement to revive and embrace classical architecture as a legitimate form of architecture for the 20th and 21st centuries. Beginning first with Postmodern architecture&#x27;s criticism of modernist architectural movements like International Style, New Classical architecture seeks to be an alternative to the ongoing dominance of Modern architecture.

<text>Kandahar is a special service area in Rural Municipality of Big Quill No. 308, Saskatchewan, Canada. Listed as a designated place by Statistics Canada, the community had a population of 20 in the Canada 2016 Census. Located on Highway 16 near Wynyard, Saskatchewan, the community was named by Canadian Pacific Railway executives in the late 19th century for a British military victory in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Kandahar is too small to be enumerated on its own, so its population belongs to the Rural Municipality of Big Quill No. 308. It is located near the south shore of Big Quill Lake, the largest inland body of salt water in Canada.

== History ==
Many of the first settlers in the Kandahar district were immigrants from Iceland or of Icelandic descent. A significant number arrived from the Argyle settlement in Manitoba. An Icelandic immigrant, Thorvidur Halldorson (born Þorviður Magnússon), served as the district&#x27;s first postmaster in 1910. From 1910 to 1913, the spelling of the post office was &quot;Candahar&quot;. Kandahar became a village in 1913, following a petition from its inhabitants. In 1925, Kandahar was listed as a Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Station on the Minnedosa, Saskatoon, Edmonton Section, CPR. Businesses included a printing press, &quot;Prentsmiðja A. Helgasonar&quot;, run by Andres Helgason (1867-1939), who was a skilled bookbinder and printer.

The one room school house was named Kandahar School District #3333.

Until the 1970s, Kandahar was a thriving community with various stores and attractions, including a popular steak house. However, in the late 1980s the community&#x27;s only school closed, and the population has steadily decreased since.

The community was profiled in Aisha Jamal&#x27;s 2019 documentary film &quot;A Kandahar Away&quot;.

Kandahar&#x27;s status was changed from organized hamlet to special service area on January 1, 2025.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kandahar had a population of 10 living in 6 of its 8 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 20. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Leonard Ray Dawson (June 20, 1935 – August 24, 2022) was an American professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) for 19 seasons, primarily with the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. After playing college football at Purdue, Dawson began his NFL career in 1957, spending three seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers and two with the Cleveland Browns. He left the NFL in 1962 to sign with the AFL&#x27;s Chiefs (then known as the Dallas Texans), where he spent the last 14 seasons of his career, and rejoined the NFL after the AFL–NFL merger.

In the AFL, Dawson led the league in completion percentage seven times, passer rating six times, and passing touchdowns four times. He was named Most Valuable Player in 1962 and selected to six AFL All-Star games. Dawson also guided the Chiefs to three AFL championships and the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl IV, of which he was named MVP. He retired from professional football after the 1975 season and later served as the sports director at KMBC-TV in Kansas City and color analyst for the Chiefs Radio Network. His demeanor and style earned him the nickname &quot;Lenny the Cool&quot; from his teammates.

==Early life==
Dawson was the seventh son of a seventh son and 9th of 11 children overall. He attended Alliance High School in Alliance, Ohio. He was MVP of the football team and was named outstanding Ohio back of the year by the International News Service. A three-sport athlete, Dawson set school records in football and basketball, and was the first athlete in 13 years to be named first-team all-state in both sports during the same year.

==College career==

During the recruiting process, Dawson had to choose between the Ohio State University in Columbus and Purdue University in Indiana. While he was reluctant to take over Woody Hayes&#x27; split-T offense with the Buckeyes, the true reason he selected Purdue stemmed from the rapport he had established with assistant coach Hank Stram, beginning a friendship that would last for more than a half-century.

As a sophomore in 1954, Dawson&#x27;s first as the Boilermakers&#x27; quarterback, he was the NCAA&#x27;s leader in pass efficiency, while also playing defense and serving as the team&#x27;s kicker. He threw four touchdown passes in a 31–0 victory over Missouri, and later engineered a huge upset of Notre Dame, which had entered the contest on a 13-game winning streak.

During three seasons (1954–1956) with the Boilermakers, Dawson threw for 3,325 yards and 29 touchdowns, leading the Big Ten Conference in that category during each year. He was named third-team All-American in 1956. He was an All-Big Ten quarterback during the 1955 and 1956 seasons.

While at Purdue, Dawson was initiated into the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

==Professional career==
===Pittsburgh Steelers===
Dawson was the fifth overall selection in the 1957 NFL draft, taken by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he was unable to make an impact. Following his rookie season in 1957, his status became more tenuous when the Steelers acquired future Hall of Famer Bobby Layne early in the 1958 season.

===Cleveland Browns===
Dawson was traded to the Cleveland Browns on December 31, 1959. However, after encountering similar problems in battling Browns quarterback Milt Plum, Dawson was released after the 1961 season, having completed only 21 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns in his five seasons of NFL play.

===Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs===
Dawson signed with the American Football League&#x27;s Dallas Texans on June 30, 1962. The move reunited him with Stram, who was beginning his third year as the Texans&#x27; head coach.

In 1962, Dawson led the league in touchdowns and yards per attempt, and was the &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ selection as the AFL MVP. He also led Dallas to the first of three league titles in a thrilling double-overtime victory over the two-time defending champion Oilers in Houston. Dawson ran a ball-control offense in the 20–17 win, and tossed a 28-yard touchdown pass to halfback Abner Haynes.
The team moved north to Kansas City and was renamed to the Chiefs in 1963.

A pinpoint passer, Dawson&#x27;s mobility helped him flourish in Stram&#x27;s &quot;moving pocket&quot; offense. He would win four AFL passing titles and was selected as a league All-Star six times, ending the 10-year run of the league as its highest-rated career passer. From 1962 to 1969, Dawson threw more touchdown passes (182) than any other professional football quarterback. In 1966, Dawson led the Chiefs to an 11–2–1 record and a 31–7 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game, earning his team the honor of representing the AFL in Super Bowl I, the first championship game between the AFL and their NFL rivals. The NFL champion Green Bay Packers won easily, 35–10, but Dawson performed fairly well, completing 16 of 27 passes for 210 yards and one touchdown, with one interception. Dawson was selected by his peers as a &quot;Sporting News&quot; 1966 AFL All-League player.

Though he threw for more than 2,000 yards in each of the previous seven campaigns, Dawson&#x27;s 1969 season with Kansas City would be his most memorable because of his dramatic comeback from a knee injury suffered in the season&#x27;s second game. The injury was at first feared to be season-ending, but after missing five games, Dawson went on to lead the Chiefs to road playoff victories over both the defending Super Bowl champion New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders. He then capped his year with MVP accolades in Super Bowl IV, the last game ever played by an American Football League team. In the game, Dawson paced the Chiefs to a win over the NFL&#x27;s heavily favored Minnesota Vikings by completing 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, and rushing for 11 yards. The performance was especially notable given that Dawson had been mistakenly linked to a gambling scandal (by an unrelated gentleman who was named Donald Dawson) in the days leading up to the game.

On November 1, 1970, the Chiefs led the Oakland Raiders 17–14 late in the fourth quarter. Facing third and long, a run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs, but as Dawson lay on the ground, he was speared by Raiders&#x27; defensive end Ben Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Chiefs&#x27; receiver Otis Taylor to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a George Blanda field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor&#x27;s retaliation against Davidson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.

===Retirement and legacy===
Dawson announced his retirement in May 1976, shortly before turning 41. Dawson ended his career in 1975, having completed 2,136 of 3,741 passes for 28,711 yards and 239 touchdowns, with 181 interceptions. He also gained 1,293 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns in his career.

Dawson retired as the Chiefs all-time career leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, rushing yards by a quarterback, and rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. Only his touchdowns records still stand. He also held the single season passing touchdown record from 1964 until it was broken in 2018. He held the single season passing yards record from 1964 until 1983. He was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 1979 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. His number 16 was retired by the Chiefs and is the only number in franchise history to be worn by a single player. He was also named to the American Football League All-Time Team in 1970.

==After professional football==

In 1966, while still playing for the Chiefs, Dawson became sports director at KMBC-TV in Kansas City. On March 16, 2009, Dawson announced he would step down from anchoring on a nightly basis but would still report for KMBC during the Chiefs football season and would fill in when other anchors were on leave.

From 1977 to 2001, Dawson hosted HBO&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL&quot;. He also worked as an analyst for NBC&#x27;s AFC coverage from 1977 to 1982. From 1985 to 2017, Dawson was the color analyst for the Chiefs&#x27; radio broadcast team. In 2012, Dawson was honored with the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award presented by the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his longtime contributions as a sports broadcaster. At the beginning of his final season as the Chiefs radio analyst, the Chiefs named their broadcast booth at Arrowhead Stadium after Dawson. When he retired after the 2017 season, he had spent 58 years with the Texans/Chiefs organization.

In 1979, Dawson was enshrined in the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame, followed by induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987 and Purdue&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2008, he was awarded the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award.

In 2006, Dawson was interviewed for the NFL Network documentary &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; chronicling the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs season.

Dawson teamed with Depend in 1998 to encourage men to visit their doctors and to be screened for prostate cancer.

==Personal life and death==
Dawson was married to his high school sweetheart from 1954 until her death in 1978. He had two children. He later remarried and remained married until his death.

In 1991, Dawson was diagnosed with prostate cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;son/ prostate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2022, Dawson&#x27;s family announced that he had entered hospice care at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas. He died on August 24, at the age of 87. He had been one of the last living members of the Chiefs franchise who dated back to its time in Dallas.

The Chiefs wore a decal with the number 16 on their helmets for the entire 2022 season in honor of Dawson. Before their first offensive play of the preseason game the day after his death, the Chiefs lined up in a huddle popularized by Dawson, where the quarterback stands in front of the other 10 offensive players instead of standing in the middle with the players making a circle around him.

<doc id="614223" wikidata="Q7871731" url="?curid=614223" title="USS Mercy (AH-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Mercy&quot; (ID-1305/AH-4) was a hospital ship in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first U.S. Navy ship of that name. The ship was previously known as SS &quot;Saratoga, a steamer for the [[Ward Line]] on the [[New York City|New York]] to [[Havana]] route, and considered the fastest steamship in coastal trade. Before being purchased by the Navy, the ship was briefly employed as [[United States Army]] transport shipUSAT &quot;Saratoga, a career that ended after a collision off Staten Island, New York.

In her Navy career, &quot;Mercy&quot; made four transatlantic round trips to France, bringing home almost 2,000 wounded men. After the end of World War I, the ship was based in Philadelphia, and briefly laid up there in 1924. The ship was decommissioned in 1934 and lent to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, struck in 1938, and scrapped in 1939.

== SS &quot;Saratoga&quot; ==
&quot;Saratoga&quot; was launched in March 1907 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, for the Ward Line of New York. The ship was placed in service later that year on the New York to Havana route where she stayed for the next ten years. She was considered by some as the fastest steamship in the coastal trade.

Shortly after entering service, the new liner was rammed by a three-masted schooner in stormy seas. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was steaming from Havana at when the schooner hit the port quarter and raked the side, at 01:00 on 29 October 1907. Her captain could not identify the other ship, but waited, in vain, for three hours to offer assistance. Damage to &quot;Saratoga&quot; was minor, though the schooner lost some rigging from the front of the ship.

In March 1911, the captain of &quot;Saratoga&quot;, Cleveland Downs, faced legal difficulties regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges of cruelty to animals because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and asked that the charges be dropped. A later &quot;Saratoga&quot; captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff Julius Harburger in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Miller’s arrest delayed the departure of the ship by two hours.

On 16 March 1912, &quot;Saratoga&quot; stood by &quot;within a few hundred yards&quot; of the hulk of when that re-floated warship was sunk in the Gulf of Mexico, allowing passengers and crew to witness the historic ship’s final disposal.

On 26 October 1914 from about 19:30 to 21:00, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was steaming north off the Virginia Capes (and south of the Scotland Lightship) when passengers and crew saw flashes and heard reports from guns of &quot;heavy calibre&quot; that they thought were from a naval gun battle. Speculation at the time centered on a confrontation between German cruiser &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;—which had been sinking British vessels in the Atlantic and Caribbean areas—and one of the Royal Navy cruisers or . A follow-up news story reported that &quot;Saratoga&quot; had chanced upon U.S. Navy gunnery practice.

On 23 May 1917 &quot;Saratoga&quot; and , her Ward Line sister-ship, were requisitioned by the U.S. government. On 2 June, after returning from her last commercial round trip to Cuba, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was turned over to the United States Army for service as a transport ship.

During her career as a passenger liner, &quot;Saratoga&quot; carried some notable passengers between New York and Caribbean ports. Mario García Menocal sailed from Havana to New York for &quot;personal business&quot; after having lost the Cuban presidential election in 1908. In 1913, Cipriano Castro, the former President of Venezuela (1899–1909), sailed to Havana for his health in 1913. A report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that Castro was going to meet with associates and &quot;professional revolutionaries&quot; in Havana in an attempt to regain power in Venezuela (which never occurred). In February 1914, Cardinal Farley, the Archbishop of New York from 1902 to 1918, sailed on &quot;Saratoga&quot; for a trip to The Bahamas.

== USAT &quot;Saratoga&quot; ==
After her requisition from the Ward Line, the steamer was turned over to the Army on 2 June 1917, becoming Army transport USAT &quot;Saratoga&quot;. She was hurriedly outfitted for troop transport duties and became part of the first group of the first American troop convoy to France during World War I. The convoy set out from Ambrose Light for Brest, France, at daybreak on 14 June 1917. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was accompanied by fellow Army transport ships &quot;Havana&quot;, , and , the cruiser , transport/auxiliary cruiser , destroyers , , , and converted yacht .

At 22:15 on 22 June, some from the convoy&#x27;s intended destination of Brest, &quot;Saratoga&quot;’s group of the convoy was attacked by submarines. Two torpedoes passed near &quot;Havana&quot; and two torpedoes straddled &quot;DeKalb&quot;. No submarine was definitively sighted and the convoy, scattered by the alarm, reformed the next morning. The group, alerted by reports of submarine activity near Brest diverted to Saint-Nazaire and arrived on 25 June.

After sailing back to the United States, &quot;Saratoga&quot; loaded 1,200 passengers at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 30 July, a hot summer day. In preparation for sailing for France the next day, the transport sailed to an anchorage at Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Among the passengers on board were nurses of the Army&#x27;s Base Hospital No. 8. To escape the sweltering heat aboard the ship, many of the nurses on board returned to their cabins after lunch and removed their heavy wool uniforms. While at anchor at about 13:30, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was rammed in the port quarter by of the Panama Steamship Company after her engine room misunderstood a command from the bridge. The force of the impact buckled plating from &quot;Saratoga&quot;&#x27;s rail down to the waterline, leaving a hole. &quot;Saratoga&quot; began to list almost immediately, and the abandon ship signal was given soon after. The passengers, including nurses in various states of undress, reported to their assigned lifeboats and evacuated the ship in an orderly fashion. The close proximity to shore, and the large number of smaller craft in the vicinity, allowed all on board to be rescued without loss of life or injury. &quot;Panama&quot; had only superficial damage; &quot;Saratoga&quot; raised anchor and was towed near the Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company where she was allowed to settle in the mud. The erstwhile &quot;Saratoga&quot; passengers were collected from the various rescue craft and were loaded onto , where they sailed for France on 6 August.

== USS &quot;Mercy&quot; ==

On 27 September 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased &quot;Saratoga&quot; from the War Department. On 30 October 1917, she began conversion to a hospital ship at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, and was commissioned USS &quot;Mercy&quot; on 24 January 1918. &quot;Mercy&quot; and (former Ward Line mate, &quot;Havana&quot;) were the first Navy hospital ships to have female nurses aboard. Both ships were outfitted with state-of-the-art operating rooms and X-ray labs and could accommodate 500 patients each.

Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Mercy&quot; operated in the Chesapeake Bay area with Yorktown, Virginia, as her home port, attending the war wounded and transporting them from ships to shore hospitals. In October 1918 she sailed for New York to join the Cruiser and Transport Service. On 3 November the hospital ship departed New York on the first of four round trips to France, returning 1,977 casualties by 25 March 1919.

For most of the next 15 years following World War I, &quot;Mercy&quot; served off the east coast based at Philadelphia. In July 1920, she was redesignated &quot;AH-4&quot;.

From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was in reserve at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 25 November she went into reduced commission, returning to full commission 1 September 1926. In early 1927, &quot;Mercy&quot; was painted white with no hospital markings, but by the time of a 1931 visit to Vancouver, the markings had been restored.

&quot;Mercy&quot; remained in commission until loaned to the Philadelphia branch of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration on 23 March 1934. Anchored at Girard Point, the ship served as a home for up to 300 homeless men. On 20 April 1938, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and on 16 March 1939 sold for scrapping to Boston Iron &amp; Metals Company of Baltimore.
