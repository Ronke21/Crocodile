<text>Flavio Briatore (; born 12 April 1950) is an Italian businessman, who currently serves as Renault&#x27;s executive advisor for Formula One. As the longtime team principal of Team Enstone (Benetton Formula / Renault F1 Team), Briatore led the team to three World Constructors&#x27; Championships and four World Drivers&#x27; Championships. However, he was dogged by allegations of cheating, including the 1994 &quot;Launch Control&quot; controversy and the 2007 &quot;Spygate&quot; affair, although in both cases his teams escaped penalties. He was forced out of Renault and received a lifetime ban from F1 after the 2008 &quot;Crashgate&quot; scandal, although a French court subsequently overturned the ban. Fifteen years later, he returned to Renault as &quot;team boss in all but name.&quot;

Briatore started his career as a restaurant manager and insurance salesman in Italy. He was convicted in Italy on several fraud charges in the 1980s, receiving two prison sentences, though the convictions were later extinguished by an amnesty. He spent several years as a fugitive in the Virgin Islands and the United States, where he set up several United Colors of Benetton franchises, paving the way for his role at Benetton&#x27;s F1 team. From 2007 to 2011, he was part-owner and chairman of English association football team Queens Park Rangers.

== Early life and Benetton business career ==
Briatore was born in Verzuolo near Cuneo in the Maritime Alps to a family of elementary school teachers. After twice failing public (state) school, he attended a private (independent) school, receiving a diploma with the lowest grades in Land Surveying at Fassino di Busca high school. Briatore found early work as a ski instructor and restaurant manager. He opened a restaurant named &quot;Tribüla&quot;, which was Briatore&#x27;s nickname. The restaurant was unsuccessful and had to close due to excessive debt.

In the 1970s, he moved to Cuneo and became an assistant to businessman Attilio Dutto, owner of the Paramatti Vernici paint company. Dutto was killed on 21 March 1979 in a car bomb attack by an unknown perpetrator.

Briatore moved to Milan and worked for Finanziaria Generale Italia at the Italian stock exchange. During this period, he met Luciano Benetton, founder of the Benetton clothing company.

=== Convictions and fugitive status ===
Briatore was convicted of multiple counts of fraud in the 1980s, receiving two prison sentences. In 1984, a court in Bergamo found him guilty of various counts of fraud and he was fined and sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The sentence was subsequently reduced to one year by a court of appeal in 1988. In 1986, in Milan, Briatore was sentenced to three years for fraud and conspiracy for his role in a team of confidence tricksters who, over a number of years, set up rigged gambling games using fake playing cards. The judges described these as elaborate confidence tricks, in which victims were invited to dinner and then &quot;ensnared&quot; in rigged games that involved a cast of fictional characters and realised enormous profits for their perpetrators. After an appeal in 1987, the sentence was reduced to one year and two months. To avoid imprisonment, Briatore lived as a fugitive in Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands. He never went to prison and returned to the EU after both convictions were extinguished by amnesty. In 2010, a Turin court ordered Briatore rehabilitated, which by Italian Criminal Code results in the extinction &quot;of any criminal effect of the conviction&quot;.

During Briatore&#x27;s fugitive status, he maintained close relations with Benetton and opened some Benetton stores in the Virgin Islands. When Benetton opened his first five stores in the United States in 1979, he appointed Briatore as director of the group&#x27;s American operations. Thanks to Benetton&#x27;s methods of franchising, the chain experienced a brief boom in popularity in the US, where, by 1989, there were 800 Benetton stores. Briatore, having taken a cut of each franchising agreement, became very wealthy. As store owners began to complain of competition from other Benetton stores, the number of stores decreased to 200 and Briatore began to look for a new business. In 1999, the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; wrongfully reported that he had been arrested in Nairobi on suspicion of fraud relating to real estate in Kenya, but further to a libel claim brought by Briatore against the newspaper, this allegation proved to be untrue and Briatore was compensated.

== Formula One ==
===Benetton Formula===

Briatore attended his first Formula One race, the Australian Grand Prix, in , having in the past proclaimed his lack of interest in the sport. Luciano Benetton appointed him commercial director of his Formula One team, Benetton Formula (formerly Toleman), and when he fired the team management shortly thereafter, Briatore was promoted to managing director and set about turning Benetton into a competitive team.

He hired and quickly fired engineer John Barnard and lured young driver Michael Schumacher from the Jordan team after his first F1 race in . &quot;The Times&quot; observed that Briatore knew Schumacher could be the best and built a team around him at Benetton. Schumacher went on to win at Spa in and again at Estoril in before claiming the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and . The Benetton team won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1995.

In 1994, Briatore rejected Umberto Agnelli&#x27;s proposal to move to Ferrari.

During the season, Briatore&#x27;s Benetton team was accused of multiple forms of cheating. Although Formula One had banned electronic driver aids ahead of the 1994 season, it was later revealed that Benetton&#x27;s cars had retained illegal software, although it remains disputed whether Benetton ever used it. Benetton&#x27;s second driver, Jos Verstappen, claimed that Briatore knew about the software and encouraged him to &quot;not talk about it.&quot; In addition, an investigation into a fire during a Verstappen pit stop revealed that Benetton had discarded a regulation fuel filter to speed up its pit stops, although Briatore escaped punishment after pointing out that multiple teams had done the same thing. Schumacher received a two-race ban for ignoring a black flag (under instructions from the team) at the , and controversially clinched his first title by crashing into his closest competitor at the .

Late in , Briatore purchased the ailing Ligier team thereby acquiring its Renault engine supply. He passed operational management of Ligier to Tom Walkinshaw and took on complete management of Benetton. When Schumacher and a number of key technical staffers departed for Ferrari in , the Benetton team slipped to the middle of the grid.

Briatore purchased a share of the Minardi team in , but after failing to sell it to British American Tobacco as he had hoped, he sold out to fellow owners Giancarlo Minardi and Gabriele Rumi. In , Benetton replaced Briatore with David Richards.

From to , he led the company Supertec, supplying Mecachrome-built Renault engines to Williams and BAR in 1999, Arrows in 2000, and under the brand name &quot;Playlife&quot; for Benetton in both 1999 and 2000.

===Renault F1===

In 2000, Renault announced its plans to return to Formula One with the purchase of the Benetton Formula team. Briatore returned as managing director and team principal, replacing Rocco Benetton. The team raced as Benetton-Renault in 2001 before becoming Renault F1 in 2002.

Briatore has a reputation as a talent-scout and probably his greatest &#x27;find&#x27; has been Fernando Alonso. Briatore met with the teenage Spaniard in 1999. As his manager, Briatore secured him a race drive with Minardi in 2001 and promoted him to test-driver for Renault in 2002.

In 2003, Briatore fired race-driver Jenson Button and replaced him with Alonso. When he replaced Button, the outcry was huge but Briatore stated, &quot;time will tell if I am wrong&quot;.

With Alonso, Renault won both the driver&#x27;s and constructor&#x27;s championships in 2005 and 2006. However, Alonso turned his back on Briatore to sign for rivals McLaren for 2007.

Briatore also acted as manager for Mark Webber, Jarno Trulli, Nelson Piquet Jr. and Heikki Kovalainen. Despite winning the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix, Trulli was dropped from Renault by Briatore and replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella.

In April 2006, Renault F1&#x27;s new president Alain Dassas stated that having a contract with Briatore for 2007 was &#x27;a key factor&#x27; in securing the company&#x27;s commitment to the sport, &quot;and we will do everything to ensure Flavio stays&quot;. Briatore was duly confirmed on 6 September 2006 as staying at Renault for the 2007 and 2008 seasons.

Briatore replaced Alonso with Kovalainen for 2007, saying &quot;with Kovalainen, I hope to find the anti-Alonso&quot;.

Allegations were made during November 2007 by the FIA against the Renault F1 team regarding information they were found to have in their possession concerning the 2006 and 2007 McLaren F1 cars. These allegations were the subject of an FIA investigation, with an FIA hearing taking place on 6 December 2007. Renault were found guilty of breaching the same regulation as McLaren (see F1 espionage scandal), but were not punished. Despite this guilty verdict, Briatore hit back at McLaren&#x27;s Ron Dennis, saying &quot;here is a team that acquired an advantage illegally. Just read the regulations: for intellectual property theft the punishment is exclusion... Ron Dennis… was the one who protested us on the mass damper. He is not the immaculate saint he pretends to be on his statements&quot;.

In August 2009, Briatore was heavily criticised by Nelson Piquet Jr., the son of three-time F1 champion Nelson Piquet, after Piquet Jr. was removed from the Renault team. On his personal website, Piquet Jr. called Briatore his &quot;executioner&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Autosport&quot;, Piquet Jr. said that Briatore &quot;is ignorant about Formula 1&quot;. Piquet Jr. criticised Briatore for his ego and for his poor sense of race tactics.

====Departure====
Briatore resigned as team principal of Renault due to a race fixing scandal. The controversy centred on an early crash involving Nelson Piquet Jr.&#x27;s car during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix of 28 September 2008, when he was still driving for Renault. At the time, Piquet Jr. described the crash as a simple mistake; however, shortly after his acrimonious departure from Renault and criticism of Briatore nearly a year later in August 2009, allegations surfaced that he had deliberately crashed to help Renault teammate Fernando Alonso, who went on to win the race. After a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) investigation, on 4 September 2009 Renault were charged with conspiracy and race fixing, and were due to face the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September 2009. In return for immunity from punishment, Piquet Jr. had reportedly stated to the FIA that he had been asked to crash by Briatore and Renault chief engineer Pat Symonds. On 11 September, following leaks of Piquet Jr.&#x27;s evidence, Renault and Briatore stated they would take legal action against Piquet Jr. for making false allegations. However, five days later, Renault announced they would not contest the charges and that Briatore and Symonds had left the team. The day after the Renault announcement, Renault confirmed Briatore had resigned from the team, while Briatore himself stated of his departure that &quot;I was just trying to save the team&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s my duty. That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve finished.&quot; The team issued the following official statement:

At the same hearing, the FIA banned Briatore from FIA-sanctioned events indefinitely. The FIA also stated that it would not renew any superlicence granted to Briatore-managed drivers, effectively barring him from managing drivers who participate in any competition that is under the FIA&#x27;s authority. The FIA stated that it was coming down hard on Briatore because he denied his involvement despite overwhelming evidence and that Renault&#x27;s actions were serious enough to merit being thrown out of F1. However, since Renault took swift action by forcing Briatore and Symonds to resign once the affair came to light, the FIA effectively placed the team on two years&#x27; probation. If Renault committed a comparable offence between 2009 and 2011, it was to be indefinitely banned from F1. British newspaper &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; described the ban as the harshest sanction ever imposed on an individual in the history of motorsport.

Briatore later said he was &quot;distraught&quot; at the FIA&#x27;s action and sued the FIA in French courts to clear his name. On 5 January 2010, the Tribunal de Grande Instance overturned the ban and granted him €15,000 in compensation. The tribunal declared in particular that &quot;the decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies&quot;. The FIA announced that it would appeal the decision issued by the French court, but the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement the following April.

In an interview with &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, Briatore said that he is sure that he will not return to Formula One, despite having his ban overturned.

===Stance on the future of F1===
Briatore has always spoken out about his desires to see F1 provide better entertainment. In 1994, he said: &quot;All the team owners are orientated towards the technical side rather than the entertainment side, and this is a big fault. Every meeting that I go to, people are talking about pistons and suspensions. Nobody goes to a race to see that kind of thing… People come to see Schumacher and Senna racing each other.&quot;

Twelve years later his feelings were much the same: &quot;The people in charge should be businessmen, as they are in Hollywood, not ex-engineers. Nothing costs more, and delivers less entertainment, than hidden technology. And that’s what engineers love most of all.&quot;

In 2007, he even went so far as to suggest that Grands Prix be split into two separate races as in the GP2 series.

On 20 March 2014, he said that it was wrong to let the car manufacturers succeed in their push for the all-new regulations, featuring &#x27;greener&#x27; engines that use less fuel. &quot;They delegated the writing of rules to engineers who do not care about the fans or entertainment, If Formula One does not change again in the near future, then the audience will be lost. Look at the comments on the internet, in blogs, on Twitter – they did not like the Australian Grand Prix. It was an indecipherable and depressing show. This is unacceptable and now we have chaos&quot; said Briatore.

On 12 June 2014, he said: &quot;I do not like this new Formula One. It&#x27;s not our Formula 1.&quot; &quot;He pointed a finger at cars that &quot;do not make a noise&quot;, drivers having to &quot;save fuel&quot; and &quot;fake overtaking&quot;. He added: &quot;It is no longer a sport of gladiators, it is a sport of accountants.&quot;

=== Return to F1 ===
Briatore returned to the former Renault F1 team (now competing as the Alpine F1 Team) in May 2024, after being courted by Renault CEO Luca de Meo. His title is the Executive Advisor for the Formula One Division, which &quot;Car&quot; magazine interpreted as &quot;team boss in all but name.&quot; &quot;Motor Sport&quot; reported that Briatore &quot;has effectively been given full scope for hirings and firings within the team.&quot;

Briatore&#x27;s return to F1 was controversial, largely due to lingering memories from Crashgate. However, several F1 executives, including Mercedes&#x27; Toto Wolff, Ferrari&#x27;s Frédéric Vasseur, and Sauber&#x27;s Alessandro Alunni Bravi, commented positively on the move.

Upon returning to Renault/Alpine, Briatore aggressively cut expenses, reducing headcount at Alpine&#x27;s Enstone facility by 25% and shuttering Renault&#x27;s Viry-Châtillon engine operation in favor of a customer engine supply from Mercedes. Briatore attributed the engine decision to Renault senior management, saying that the decision was made before he joined the team, and that &quot;whatever our chairman decides [is] fine.&quot; Several media outlets suggested that de Meo had given Briatore a mandate to make the team more attractive to a potential buyer, but Briatore denied the accusation.

==Business interests==
Briatore has developed a diverse portfolio of business interests outside Formula 1, many of which revolve around fashion.

He created the brand in 1998 and owns a club in Sardinia; in August 2012, he opened another Billionaire club in Marbella under that name along with an haute couture line, Billionaire Italian Couture. In addition to that, he opened Cipriani&#x27;s restaurant in Mayfair, London, in 2004 and until 2007 owned 48.9% of the pharmaceuticals company . He also operates a Tuscan beach club and Lion in the Sun, a holiday resort in Kenya.

Briatore is a beneficiary of Autumn Sailing Ltd, which purchased the super yacht &quot;Force Blue&quot; from Home Shopping Network investor Roy Speer for £68.2m. She was given a refitted interior designed by Celeste dell&#x27;Anna and a blue exterior. The yacht was then chartered by a number of individuals including Briatore, who named it as the most extravagant present he had ever bought himself. In 2010, the yacht was seized by officers investigating a tax fraud over its charter status and VAT on fuel. The Italian Supreme Court ruled that there were no issues with the seizure, though the yacht itself was released

==Queens Park Rangers==
In 2007, Briatore was linked to a takeover of English Championship football club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) from a Monaco-based consortium led by Gianni Paladini. On 1 September 2007, it was officially announced that Briatore (along with Bernie Ecclestone and Lakshmi Mittal) had bought the club. On 7 November 2007, Briatore completed his takeover of QPR together with Ecclestone. He served as the club&#x27;s chairman.

In December 2007, Briatore and Ecclestone were joined as co-owners of QPR by multi-billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, who bought 20% of the club.

Following Briatore&#x27;s ban from FIA, the Football League requested that FIA provide details of its investigation. The Football League could force Briatore out of QPR under rules that stipulate a club owner must be a &quot;fit and proper person&quot;. The Football League also has the power to ban owners who have been banned from another sporting organisation. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. It was announced that he had stepped down from the post, effective from 19 February 2010.

When interviewed about the QPR experience on an Italian chat show, he stated: &quot;I will never invest in a football club again, it&#x27;s only ever a good idea if you&#x27;re very rich and looking for ways to waste your money. In two years you&#x27;ll be very poor and won&#x27;t have that problem anymore&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1993, an explosive device destroyed the front door of Briatore&#x27;s London mansion. The Provisional Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility.

In 1998, Briatore became engaged to supermodel Naomi Campbell; they were involved in an on-again-off-again relationship until their separation in 2003. Campbell now considers him her &quot;mentor&quot;.

In March 2003, Briatore began dating supermodel Heidi Klum. In December, she announced her pregnancy. Soon after, the two split and Klum began dating the musician Seal. Klum gave birth to Leni Klum in New York City in May 2004. According to Klum, Briatore is not involved in Leni&#x27;s life; she has stated emphatically that &quot;Seal is Leni&#x27;s father&quot;. In 2009, Briatore allowed Seal to adopt his daughter and change her name.

Briatore married the &#x27;Wonderbra&#x27; model Elisabetta Gregoraci on 14 June 2008. Gregoraci gave birth to their son in Nice, France in 2010.

In 2019, Briatore founded the political party Movimento del Fare.

<text>Robert George Uecker ( ; January 26, 1934 – January 16, 2025) was an American professional baseball catcher and sportscaster who served as the play-by-play announcer for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB) for 54 seasons. He was also an occasional television and film actor.

Uecker signed with his hometown Milwaukee Braves in 1956, spending several years in the minor leagues with various affiliate clubs before making his major league debut in 1962. As a backup catcher, he played for the Milwaukee Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, and Atlanta Braves from 1962 to 1967. He won a World Series with the Cardinals in 1964.

After retiring, Uecker started a broadcasting career and served as the primary broadcaster for Milwaukee Brewers radio broadcasts from 1971. Uecker became known for his self-deprecating wit and became a regular fixture on late night talk shows in the 1970s and 1980s, facetiously dubbed &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; by talk show host Johnny Carson. He hosted several sports blooper shows and had an acting career that included his role as George Owens on the television program &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; and as play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle in the film &quot;Major League&quot; and its two sequels.

Uecker was honored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame with its 2003 Ford C. Frick Award in recognition of his broadcasting career.

==Early life==
Though he sometimes joked that he had been born on an oleo run to nearby Illinois (margarine was prohibited in the dairy state of Wisconsin for many years), Uecker was born and raised in Milwaukee. He was the son of Michigan native Mary (née Schultz) and August &quot;Gus&quot; Uecker. Mr. Uecker had emigrated from Switzerland in 1923. Bob also had two younger sisters, Carol Ann and Rosemary. He grew up watching the minor-league Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association at Borchert Field.

Uecker enlisted in the US Army in 1954, ultimately achieving the rank of corporal. He played baseball while at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri and Fort Belvoir in Virginia, where he was teammates with future fellow major leaguer Dick Groat.

==Playing career==

After his Army service, Uecker signed a professional contract with his hometown Milwaukee Braves in 1956. With the Braves organization, Uecker played in the minor leagues. In his first season, he played in with the Eau Claire Bears in the Northern League and Boise Braves in the Pioneer League. Between both of the clubs, he hit 19 home runs.

Uecker made his major league debut with the club on April 13, 1962. He served as their third-string catcher behind Joe Torre and Del Crandall; Uecker batted .250 in 33 games. He appeared in nine games for the Braves in 1963 before he was demoted to the minor leagues. Before the 1964 season, the Braves traded Uecker to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor leaguers Jimmie Coker and Gary Kolb. He seldom played for the Cardinals, but was a member of the 1964 World Series champions with the Cardinals. After the 1965 season, the Cardinals traded Uecker, Dick Groat, and Bill White to the Philadelphia Philles for Pat Corrales, Alex Johnson, and Art Mahaffey.
 On June 6, 1967, the Phillies traded Uecker back to the Braves, now based in Atlanta, for Gene Oliver. His six-year major league career concluded in 1967.

A below-average hitter, he finished with a career batting average of .200, retroactively at the Mendoza Line, though with four of his seasons ending above .200. He was generally considered to be a sound defensive player and committed very few errors as a catcher, completing his career with a fielding percentage of .981. However, in 1967, despite playing only 59 games, he led the league in passed balls. At least a partial explanation is that he spent a good deal of the season catching Phil Niekro, who threw a knuckleball. Uecker often joked that the best way to catch a knuckleball was to wait until it stopped rolling and pick it up.

==Broadcasting career==

After retiring as a player, Uecker became a broadcaster, starting with WSB-TV in Atlanta. In 1971, he began calling play-by-play for the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; radio broadcasts. Uecker&#x27;s tenure as a Brewers broadcaster for 54 seasons was the second-longest continuous tenure with one team among active Major League Baseball announcers prior to his death, trailing only Kansas City Royals broadcaster Denny Matthews (1969–present).

In the baseball off-season Uecker was the radio color commentator for University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee Panthers men&#x27;s basketball and football games carried by WTMJ (620) and WTMJ-FM (1130) in the early 1970s.

During his Brewers tenure, Uecker mentored Pat Hughes, Jim Powell, Cory Provus and Joe Block, all of whom became primary radio announcers for other MLB teams. He also called the 1982 World Series locally for the Brewers on WISN (1130) in Milwaukee.

For several years he also served as a color commentator for network television broadcasts of Major League Baseball, helping call games for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s and NBC (teaming with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan) in the 1990s. During that time, he was a commentator for several All-Star Games, League Championship Series and World Series.

At NBC, Uecker was a color commentator for the 1994 and 1996 All-Star Games, 1995 and 1996 American League Championship Series, 1997 National League Championship Series, and the 1995 and 1997 World Series. Uecker left NBC before he got a chance to call the 1998 All-Star Game from Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Uecker underwent a back operation in which four discs were replaced. For the remainder of NBC&#x27;s contract (1998–2000), only Bob Costas and Joe Morgan called the games.

He was well known for saying his catchphrase &quot;Get up! Get up! Get outta here! Gone!&quot; when a Brewers player hit a home run.

In 2014, Uecker cut back on his workload, limiting the number of road games he would call and traveling he would undertake, due to prior health issues.

Prior to the 2021 season, Uecker had never signed an official written contract with the Brewers to do the team&#x27;s play-by-play, instead agreeing to do so via an undisclosed number of handshake agreements with either Bud Selig or Mark Attanasio, the owners of the team. He signed a contract in 2021, in order to be covered under the Brewers&#x27; health insurance plan after cuts to his SAG-AFTRA benefits for acting work.

From 2022 to 2024, Uecker teamed with Jeff Levering and Lane Grindle to call Brewers home games and road games in Chicago on WTMJ in Milwaukee and the Brewers Radio Network throughout Wisconsin.

Uecker&#x27;s final broadcast was Game 3 of the National League Wild Card Series between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Mets on October 3, 2024.

==Sports expertise outside baseball==
Uecker&#x27;s sports expertise extended beyond baseball. He hosted two syndicated television shows, &quot;Bob Uecker&#x27;s Wacky World of Sports&quot; and &quot;Bob Uecker&#x27;s War of the Stars&quot;. The former has since become known as &quot;The Lighter Side of Sports&quot; (albeit with a different host, Mike Golic) and remains one of the longest-running syndicated sports programs in American television history.

Uecker also appeared in a series of commercials for the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League in the mid-1990s, including one in which he re-designed the team&#x27;s uniforms to feature a garish plaid reminiscent of the loud sports coats synonymous with Uecker in the 1970s and 1980s. In February 2006, the Admirals commemorated those commercials with a special event in which the players wore the plaid jerseys during a game. The jerseys were then auctioned off to benefit charity.

==Wrestling announcer==
In March 1987, Uecker appeared at World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) WrestleMania III in Pontiac, Michigan, as the ring announcer for the pay-per-view&#x27;s main event of Hulk Hogan versus André the Giant. He returned in 1988 at WrestleMania IV as a ringside announcer, commentator during the opening Battle Royal and backstage interviewer.

==Humor==
Known for his humor, particularly about his undistinguished playing career, Uecker actually became much better known after he retired from playing. Most of his wisecracks poked fun at himself. He once joked that after he hit a grand slam off pitcher Ron Herbel (on June 21, 1967), &quot;When his manager came out to get him, he was bringing Herbel&#x27;s suitcase.&quot; On another occasion, he quipped, &quot;Sporting goods companies would pay me &quot;not&quot; to endorse their products.&quot;

He made some 100 guest appearances on Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. Uecker hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during its 10th season on October 13, 1984. The episode also featured musical performances by Peter Wolf.
Uecker appeared in a series of Miller Lite commercials starting in the 1980s. In one commercial from that decade, Uecker was seen preparing to watch a baseball game when an informs him he is in the wrong seat. Uecker pompously remarks, &quot;I must be in the &quot;front&quot; row&quot;, which became another of his catchphrases. The punch line was that Uecker&#x27;s seat was actually in the nosebleed section. Since then, the farthest seats from the action in some arenas and stadiums have been jokingly called &quot;Uecker seats&quot;. There is a section of $1 seating called the &quot;Uecker seats&quot; at American Family Field, the baseball stadium of the Milwaukee Brewers. Referencing where Uecker sat in the Miller Lite commercials, these seats have an obstructed-view area (in the upper grandstand above home plate where the stadium&#x27;s roof pivot comes together). Another of Uecker&#x27;s catchphrases from the aforementioned Miller Lite &quot;front row&quot; commercial is, &quot;He missed the tag!&quot; which he yells with confidence from his seat in the top row of the upper deck of the stadium, far away from the action.

Locally, Uecker lent his endorsement skills to several companies and products in Milwaukee, including the Milwaukee Admirals, Rank &amp; Son Buick, Usinger&#x27;s Sausage, the Wisconsin Department of Tourism for its &quot;You&#x27;re Among Friends&quot; campaign, and several road and bicycle safety campaigns for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. He was inducted into the Wisconsin Advertising Hall of Fame in 2017 by the United Adworkers Milwaukee, Local 99.

Uecker authored two books: an autobiography, &quot;Catcher in the Wry&quot; with Mickey Herskowitz, and &quot;Catch 222&quot;. (The titles are wordplay on the novels &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot;Catch-22&quot;.)

==Acting roles==
Uecker played the character of father and sportswriter George Owens on the 1985–1990 sitcom &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;, appearing regularly. He made cameo appearances as himself in the films &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot;, and &quot;Fatal Instinct&quot;, and in episodes of the sitcoms &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;D.C. Follies&quot;, and &quot;LateLine&quot;. He was the voice of the &quot;head of Bob Uecker&quot; in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;A Leela of Her Own&quot;.

Uecker played Harry Doyle, the broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians (now Cleveland Guardians), in the &quot;Major League&quot; film trilogy. In the movies, Uecker&#x27;s character is known for his witticisms and his tendency to become intoxicated from drinking during losing games, as well as downplaying poor play by the team for the radio audience: for example, in the first film he also coins another popular sports catchphrase &quot;Juuust a bit outside&quot;, to downplay an extremely wild pitch from Ricky &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Vaughn (played by Charlie Sheen). Uecker received the role not because of his broadcasting history with the Brewers but because of his popular Miller Lite commercials.

In 2021, Uecker made a guest appearance in the Disney+ series &quot;Monsters at Work&quot; where he voiced a parody of himself named &quot;Bob Yucker&quot;.

==Honors==
The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Uecker as Wisconsin Sportscaster of the Year five times (1977, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1987), and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 2011.

Uecker was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2003, he received the Ford C. Frick Award, bestowed annually by the Baseball Hall of Fame to a broadcaster for &quot;major contributions to baseball&quot;. His humorous and self-deprecating speech was a highlight of the ceremony.

In 2005, Uecker&#x27;s 50th year in professional baseball, the Milwaukee Brewers placed a number 50 in his honor in their &quot;Ring of Honor&quot;, near the retired numbers of Robin Yount and Paul Molitor. Four years later, on May 12, 2009, Uecker&#x27;s name was also added to the Brewers Wall of Honor inside American Family Field.

Uecker was inducted into the Celebrity Wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010, honored for his appearances at WrestleMania III and WrestleMania IV.

On August 31, 2012, the Brewers erected the Uecker Monument outside American Family Field alongside statues of Hank Aaron, Robin Yount and Bud Selig.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers declared September 25, 2021, as Bob Uecker Day in honor of his 50th year broadcasting Brewers games. Uecker threw out the first pitch in the game against the New York Mets. But instead of throwing the ball to the catcher, he unveiled a pitching machine and used that. Before the game, left fielder Christian Yelich presented a gift on behalf of the players, a pair of custom Nike sneakers with &quot;Air Uecker&quot; and &quot;Get Up, Get Up&quot; on one foot and &quot;One Of Us&quot; and &quot;Just a Bit Outside&quot; (see reference in the section above) on the other.

== Personal life ==
Uecker and his first wife, Joyce (died 2015), had four children: Leeann (1957–2022), who died of ALS in March 2022; Steve (1959–2012), a cowboy, who died of complications of San Joaquin Valley fever; Sue Ann; and Bob Jr.

Uecker and his second wife, Judy, were married in Louisiana in 1976. They settled in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls.

===Illness and death===
On April 27, 2010, Uecker announced that he was going to miss 10–12 weeks of the 2010 baseball season because of heart surgery. His aortic valve and a portion of his aortic root were successfully replaced four days later, and he returned to broadcasting for the Brewers on July 23. On October 14, 2010, the Brewers announced Uecker would again undergo heart surgery, this time to repair a tear at the site of his valve replacement.

Uecker was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer in 2023. He died at his Menomonee Falls home on January 16, 2025, ten days shy of his 91st birthday.

<text>The Nissan Altima is a mid-size car manufactured by Nissan since 1992. It is a continuation of the Nissan Bluebird line, which began in 1955.

The Altima has historically been larger, more powerful, and more luxurious than the Nissan Sentra but less so than the Nissan Maxima. The first through fourth-generation cars were manufactured exclusively in the United States and officially sold in North and South America, along with the Middle East and Australia. For other markets, Nissan sold a related mid-size sedan called the Nissan Teana which was between the Altima and Maxima in terms of size. In 2013, the Teana became a rebadged version of the fifth-generation Altima.

The name &quot;Altima&quot; was originally applied to a top trim line of the Nissan Leopard for the Japanese market in 1986, and then to the Nissan Laurel Altima mid-size car sold in Central America and the Caribbean before 1992. In 1992, Nissan discontinued the Stanza which was a Nissan Bluebird clone, replacing it with the US-built Altima, while remaining a compact car. The first Altima was produced in June 1992, as a 1993 model. All Altima models for the North American market were built in Smyrna, Tennessee, until June 2004, when Nissan&#x27;s Canton, Mississippi plant also began producing the model to meet high demand.


==First generation (U13; 1993)==
Like the Stanza before it, the original Altima was the export version of the Nissan Bluebird SSS (chassis model U13), though its original styling hailed from Nissan&#x27;s California design group (Blue Studio under Allan Flowers) in 1989. Initially, the car&#x27;s official name was &quot;Stanza Altima,&quot; which appears on the early owner&#x27;s manuals. 1993 models can be seen with a sticker reading &quot;Stanza&quot; in small lettering to the right of the ALTIMA emblem on the trunk lid.

All Altima models used Nissan&#x27;s KA24DE straight-4 DOHC engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic (acceleration performance: 9.4 seconds 0–60  mph (0–100  km/h) with automatic and 8.2 with manual). (By contrast, the Japanese top trim package Bluebird SSS could be had with Nissan&#x27;s SR20DET engine and ATTESA all-wheel-drive.) The suspension was composed of struts with stabilizer bars at both ends and was noted for providing sporty, satisfying handling (plus a firm ride and moderate road noise); all wheels were 15 inches. Being one of the bigger compact cars, the Altima could seat four adults fairly comfortably, though its body was too narrow for five. Trim lines consisted of the stripped XE, mid-line GXE, sporty SE, and luxury GLE. Some options included a gold emblem package, molded mud guards, and a pinstripe. All models had small cup holders under the radio and a small glovebox which were improved in the 1998 redesign.

The base XE (rare) had manual windows. The mid-line GXE had power windows, a power retracting antenna, pass thru rear armrest, a digital clock in the dash (which became optional on 1995 models), and color-matched plastic speaker grilles for the rear 6-inch speakers. The XE and GXE models only had the fixed intermittent wiper switch.

In addition to the GXE features, the SE had a stiffer suspension, fog lights, 3 leg mount rear spoiler (1993 models with a clear LED brake light), side skirts (no upper side moldings), and sport seats (plus a standard sunroof in 1994–1995). It also had 4-wheel disc brakes, which came on the other trim lines when antilock brakes were ordered.

The GLE&#x27;s enhancements included a digital automotive head-up display (1993 and 1994 only), which displayed speed in mph or km/h, turn signals, and various warning lights on a unique mirrored patch made into the windshield. The 1989 to 1994 Maxima and 240SX had similar technology but only showed speed. Other features included a coin holder built into the fuse panel cover (1993 and 1994 only), adjustable lumbar support on the front seats, automatic digital climate control, keyless entry with alarm (optional), floor mats, color-matched side mirrors, cornering lights, sunroof, and a higher-powered six-speaker cassette/CD stereo which included 6X9 rear speakers with black metal &quot;active speaker&quot; grilles, metal color matched &quot;active speaker&quot; grilles for the front door speakers (1993 and 1994 only), and a pair of A pillar tweeters all powered by two factory amps mounted underneath the rear deck. In 1997 it gave up all of the above in exchange for standard leather (previously optional). All SE and GLE models had alloy wheels and variable intermittent wipers.

1993 Altimas came with a rosewood-colored dash trim and a driver&#x27;s side airbag coupled with automatic shoulder belts (the center console was slimmer to accommodate the lap belts). The 1994 Altima gained a darker burl wood dash trim, a flush-mount passenger airbag, and regular seat belts. 1993 and 1994 models came with chrome inner door handles standard with an auto door lock/unlock feature on the passenger side. For 1995, the inner door handles were changed to color-matched plastic, and a plug was replaced where the passenger auto door lock/unlock feature was. 1993 and 1994 models also had a slim armrest lid, however, if an optional leather armrest was selected, it brought the height up to about . For 1995, all the armrest lids were thicker and about tall. The 1995 model year (introduced 1994) also brought a new venetian blind-like the grille, new tail lights (red and clear), and a new 2-leg mount spoiler with a red LED brake light for the SE. Some other changes included the removal of the rear speaker grilles for a flat rear deck, a cheaper cloth interior, a plastic cover replacing the rear ashtray, and the digital in-dash clock was now optional. A 1995.5 model, entering production on March 3, 1995, introduced a raised-mount passenger airbag with a new inflator. 1996 brought new wheel covers for base models. During the 1997 model year, the GXE gained a new &quot;Limited Edition&quot; package including alloy wheels, keyless entry, alarm, floor mats, and a Limited Edition sticker on each side near the front wheels. The majority of final-year Altima models were dubbed &quot;1997.5&quot; models, signifying the added crash protection necessary to meet 1997 side-impact standards.
==Second generation (L30; 1998)==
The second generation (chassis model L30) was an American market-only version, again styled by Nissan&#x27;s California design center under Doug Wilson through 1994 (design freeze in 1995). A new interior (by Diane Allen) brought a revised glove box and cup holders, a folding back seat (except on XE), and depowered airbags. The Japanese domestic market Bluebird U14 has different front and rear ends, and slightly narrower width dimensions to comply with the Japanese government dimension regulations.

While total volume remained identical at , most felt it was distributed better and resulted in a slightly roomier-feeling cabin. On the downside, many were let down by the new model&#x27;s plainer styling and cheapened interior; some also felt the gas pedal was now too lightly sprung.

Trim lines were the stripped XE, volume-selling GXE, sporty SE, and luxury-trimmed GLE. The SE can be distinguished by its body-color grille, fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and white-faced gauges. In this generation of Altima, all GLEs had leather seats standard.

For 1999, the uplevel cassette/CD stereo got a new faceplate, GXE and SE models gained variable intermittent wipers, and GLEs gained standard alloy wheels. The majority of changes came for the 2000 model year. The engine increased in power from 150 to 160 horsepower with 4-way sparks, while it also improved the 0–60  mph time from 8.7 to 8.4 seconds. Gearing and final drive ratios were shortened on both transmissions, stabilizer bars were thickened, and the steering was firmed up. SE and GLE models also upgraded to 16-inch wheels with lower-profile tires, new Monroe struts with &quot;acceleration-sensitive strut valving&quot;, and a front strut tower brace for sportier handling (all optional on GXE).

The Altima grew slightly longer and got a deeper front grille, one-piece headlamps with integrated turn signals and standard low-speed cornering lamps, all-red tail lights, and the plastic trim on the deck lid. Inside were new front seats with a driver&#x27;s height adjuster, cup holders for the rear seat (automatic transmission models only), revised seat cloth, a new instrument panel with digital odometer, a new rear window antenna, and the keyless entry fob now included a trunk release. Side airbags were newly standard on GLE and available on GXE and SE. For 2001, the Altima GXE again gained a Limited Edition package: a power driver&#x27;s seat, keyless entry with alarm, and floor mats.

==Third generation (L31; 2002)==
The third-generation Altima (chassis model L31) debuted for the 2002 model year. It was the first mass-market product built on Nissan&#x27;s new FF-L platform, which was unique to North America and had no equivalent model in Japan. The Asian Nissan Teana is similar but not quite identical, designed for Asian market requirements; all three model lines shared the same platform. The Altima grew significantly for this generation, as interior volume expanded to . The Altima&#x27;s interior dimensions even surpassed that of the higher-end 2000-03 Maxima, so the 2004 Maxima was moved more upscale into the full-size bracket. Also, the biggest in class was the Altima&#x27;s fuel tank. Additionally, the Altima upgraded its rear suspension to a multi-link type and its brakes to 4-wheel discs. This was the first generation to offer a V6 engine.

2003–2004 models received two-tone dash color, and the 3.5 SE received an upgrade in horsepower, from to , though torque stayed the same at . 2002–2004 models with manual gearbox were the lightest of the V6 (4DR) cars. The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine accelerated the sedan from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 8.6 seconds.

The 2005 Nissan Altima received a facelift, including a new front grille, all-red tail lights, redesigned interior, and an optional DVD-based navigation system. The V6 was now rated at with torque rated at , and a 0–60  mph (97  km/h) time of 6.2 seconds utilizing the 5-speed automatic transmission. Also new was the SE-R model with a and of torque version of the V6, a 6-speed manual transmission (automatic still optional), upgraded brakes, 18-inch wheels, a suspension even stiffer than that of the 3.5 SE&#x27;s, and a high-flow exhaust. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested the SE-R resulting in 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.1 seconds. &quot;MotorWeek&quot; episode #2432 tested a SE-R equipped with an automatic transmission that produced a 0–60  mph time of 5.8 seconds.

===Reception===
The third-generation Altima was well received by the press, with many critics praising the new style and extra space, being one of the most powerful and best-handling family sedans available. As the Altima offered the performance and space of the upper-market Maxima in a less expensive car, this significantly reduced Maxima sales but made Nissan competitive in the mid-size segment for the first time. While previous iterations received decent reviews, the third-generation Altima was the first to enjoy considerable success, and it was credited with a turnaround of Nissan&#x27;s operations from debt-ridden to among the industry&#x27;s most profitable.

Most of the criticism centered on the interior found in the 2002–2004 models, which were cited for using hard and brittle plastics. Some also found the steering too light and or abrupt, and the turning circle too wide due to its elongated wheelbase.

===Mechanical issues===
The 2002 2.5L Altimas had major excessive oil consumption issues causing potential catastrophic engine failures. Some cases were because of owner neglect and other cases involving the catalytic converter failing, forcing foreign objects back into the exhaust manifold. Most reports were received after the vehicle is beyond 100,000 miles and more than eight years old (beyond any warranties) and most of the reports had only to do with the 2002–2003 model ranges.

In April 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all Nissan Altima owners of 2002 through 2006 model years. The lawsuit originally alleged that Nissan manufactured those model years with defective floorboards on both the driver and passenger side of the vehicle but was dismissed by a judge in January 2016. The resulting premature rust was extensive and generally happened out of warranty. The real cause was that the front mudguards were not high enough and there was no stone guard applied to the metal plates underneath the vehicle. Other car models from other car manufacturers have also experienced the same problem to a lesser extent. Nissan changed the design of the floorboards for the 4th generation and thus the problem did not reoccur again from MY2007 onwards.
==Fourth generation (L32; 2007)==

The fourth generation Nissan Altima (chassis model L32A) was announced at the 2006 New York International Auto Show on April 12, 2006. It was the first vehicle to use the smaller Nissan D platform, with a new front and upgraded rear suspension. The wheelbase is shorter than the third-generation Altima, but interior space was mostly unchanged. The Maxima and Murano also used this new platform starting with the 2009 models. As with the previous generation, it shares much of its mechanicals and platform with the Nissan Teana which is built for different market conditions in Asia.

The fourth-generation Altima used revised versions of the engines from the third-generation model. The VQ35DE 3.5 L V6 engine produces and of torque, and the QR25DE 2.5 L straight-four engine produces and of torque. A 6-speed manual is standard, and a continuously variable transmission replaced the traditional automatic as the optional transmission.

This generation Altima came packaged with new technology such as a standard Smart Key (referred to as the &quot;Nissan Intelligent Key&quot;), along with available Bluetooth capability for cell phones, and a parking camera. The dashboard was designed with larger buttons for easy readability and a total of eight cup holders, two in front of the center console, two in the rear armrest, and one 20-ounce cup holder in each door. Several hidden compartments were added as well as doubling the glove compartment space to . For 2008, all Altima models received ABS with electronic brake-force distribution.

In 2008, a new base model named the 2.5 became available as a more affordable version by offering less equipment. 

===Facelift===

In 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Nissan Altima was facelifted with a new front fascia, hood, and headlights, as well as new wheels and interior materials. Electronic stability control, previously only offered as part of an option package on V6 models and unavailable with 4-cylinder engines, is now standard on all Altima trims including 4-cylinder models. The CVT had been made standard by this point for all trims; the manual was dropped for the 2011 model year. However, the SR (formerly the SE) could still be had with a 6-speed manual (though this was for customer orders only).

=== Coupe (D32, 2008) ===
The coupe version of the Nissan Altima (codename D32) was officially revealed at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show, Nissan&#x27;s first-ever two-door Altima. It had a shorter wheelbase, shorter overall length, and lower height than the Altima Sedan. It was released on May 25, 2007, as a 2008 model.

The 2008 Altima Coupe was available with two engines: the same updated VQ35DE in the sedan, a 3.5-liter 24-valve DOHC V6 or the QR25DE, a 2.5-liter DOHC 16-valve inline 4-cylinder.

====Facelift====

Like the sedan, the Altima Coupe received a facelift for 2010 which included a redesigned front end, hood and grille, new projector beam headlights, and the Altima Coupe 2.5 S model came standard with 17&quot; × 7.5&quot; 5-split spoke aluminum alloy wheels, along with P215/55TR17 all-season tires instead of the 16&quot; steel wheels provided in the former. The SE model was renamed SR and came standard with 18&quot; × 8.0&quot; 5-split-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels, and there was a revision to the fabric and trim pieces in the interior. The 2010 models came with Nissan&#x27;s Vehicle Dynamic Control as standard equipment, which was previously a $600 (~$ in ) stand-alone option. A new premium Bose audio system with a 4.3-inch color display and Nissan&#x27;s next-generation navigation system with a 6.5-inch color display with an internal hard drive providing 9.3 GB of music storage and USB connectivity were also included with the refresh. Azure Blue was replaced by Navy Blue and there were two additional colors: Crimson Black and Ocean Gray.

For the 2013 model year (Generation 5), the 3.5 SR trim level was dropped completely for the coupe, meaning that for this particular model year, only the sedan was available with a 3.5 L V6, and 2013 is the last model year for the Altima Coupe, while the sedan gets redesigned for the 2013 model year and continues production for future model years. This model year also included the first, standard equipped, NASA-inspired &quot;zero gravity&quot; front row seating. These seats use research from the U.S. space and aeronautics agency to reduce muscle fatigue in drivers. Zero Gravity seating is now available in the 2015 and 2016 Rogue, 2015 Altima, 2015 Murano, 2016 Maxima, and 2016 Titan.

===Hybrid===

The Altima Hybrid was Nissan&#x27;s first hybrid car, first introduced in February 2007 and discontinued in the 2011 model year. In the U.S. it was only available in 10 states that followed California&#x27;s strict energy laws (California, Oregon, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont), and was also available in Canada. Its hybrid-drive system was licensed from Toyota&#x27;s hybrid technology; the company asserted that subsequent hybrid models would be based on hybrid technology developed in-house. Up to 40,000 per year were to be built at Nissan&#x27;s Smyrna plant. The Altima Hybrid was also used as a regular taxi vehicle and as a police cruiser with the New York City Police Department until it was discontinued.

The Hybrid featured a 2.5 L &quot;QR25DE&quot; engine producing and of torque, and CVT. The electric motor/generator put out an additional 40 horsepower putting out max power of , and . Its fuel efficiency was city and highway, based on revised EPA measures for fuel economy ratings. After the 2011 model year Nissan discontinued the Altima Hybrid due to poor sales.

Features on the Hybrid were identical to that of the gasoline-only 2.5 S trim, and additional packages were also available, including a package that added leather-trimmed seating surfaces. The Hybrid also included the aluminum-alloy wheels that were otherwise optional on the 2.5 S.

==Fifth generation (L33; 2013)==
A redesigned Altima debuted at the 2012 New York International Auto Show for the 2013 model year and went on sale in the summer of 2012. The exterior design took cues from the Ellure Concept previewed in 2010.

It continued to offer a base 4-cylinder engine with a 3.5-liter V6 as the range-topper. Specifications for the &quot;QR25DE&quot; 2.5-liter 16-valve DOHC inline-four engine are and , while the &quot;VQ35DE&quot; 3.5-liter 24-valve DOHC V6 remains and . Nissan estimates the 2.5-liter fuel economy to be 27 city/38 hwy and the 3.5-liter V6 at 22 city/30 hwy thanks to its refined CVT that has been lightened by 8 lbs. Most of the major mechanical components of this generation Altima are carried over. Much of the exterior styling seems to draw familiar traits from the Nissan Maxima. For the first time, a manual transmission is not available.

Despite the larger size of the Altima compared to the previous model, the new Altima weighs about 120 pounds less. The Altima continues to be the lightest midsize sedan in its class; this is mostly due to its efficient use of high-strength steel and aluminum in areas such as the trunk, hood, and roof. The front end shares the same new corporate grille as the 2012 Versa with more angular headlights than Versa&#x27;s rounded ones. It draws many styling influences from &quot;coke bottle styling&quot;, an appearance that was popular during the 1960s and 1970s, a return to an appearance Nissan used during that time.

In the US, Nissan offers the L33 Altima in five different trims; 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SV, 2.5 SL, and 3.5 SL. 3.5 S and 3.5 SV were discontinued for the 2015 model year. Alongside the L33 Altima sedan, the previous-generation L32 Altima coupe will continue on sale. The coupe will only be offered with the &quot;QR25DE&quot; 2.5-Liter four-cylinder rated at and of torque mated with a CVT. The 6-speed manual transmission is no longer available in the Altima Sedan due to slow sales. The SL model, which was once an equipment package for the Altima 2.5 S, is now separate.

Production started in late May 2012 and the car went on sale in June in the United States, and August of the same year in Canada. The Altima will also be on sale in various other markets (existing or new), particularly the Middle East where it replaces the fourth generation L32A models, and the Australian market for the first time, replacing the Nissan Maxima J32 (Teana). The L33 Altima was discontinued in Australia and New Zealand on 5 April 2017, alongside the B17 Sylphy-based Pulsar sedan. 

The Nissan Altima Coupe was discontinued due to slow sales after the 2013 model year, which means Nissan will only focus on the sedan model for the Altima while the hybrid and coupe are discontinued.

The Advanced Drive-Assist Display was added in 2013. 

The 2016 model year saw the return of the SR performance model in the US.

===Nissan Teana===

In Japan, China, and other Asian markets, the L33 Altima became the third-generation Teana.

The third generation Nissan Teana was introduced to Japan as a rebadged version of the North American Altima. In Japan, the Teana is offered in 2.5L engine with three different trims; XV, XL and XE.

It is available in most Asian countries since its introduction.

In Thailand, the L33 Teana debuted in August 2013 where it was available with either a 2.0L engine with three variants, XE, XL, and XL Navi, or a 2.5L engine with two variants, XV and XV Navi. Five years later, the L33 Teana in Thailand received the front end of the facelifted Altima. Variants was also streamlined down to just three: 2.0XL, 2.0XL Navi and 2.5XV Navi.

In Malaysia, the L33 Teana was launched in June 2014 and it is available with either 2.0L or 2.5L engines. Three variants were available which were the 2.0XE, 2.0XL, and 2.5XV. In December 2016, two optional accessories packages became available: Nismo Aero Package and Nismo Performance Package. The Nismo Aero Package added front bumper spoilers, rear bumper spoilers, side skirts, trunk lid spoiler, and exhaust finisher. The Nismo Performance Package added all that with the Nismo Aero Package in addition to Nismo sport springs and Nismo LMX6 18-inch alloy wheels. The L33 Teana has since been discontinued in Malaysia.

In China, a longer wheelbase luxury Teana is sold as the &quot;Teana VIP&quot; and bears VIP logos stitched into the seats and a &quot;VIP&quot; badge on the trunk lid. The Teana VIP has an extended backseat door and wheelbase (+75/+125mm) and is equipped with a 9-speaker Bose surround system, rear-passenger controls, and rear-passenger video screens.

Nissan India has discontinued its Teana D-segment sedan as Teana failed to generate volumes for the carmaker in India in 2014. The company has also removed the saloon from its official website.

===Facelift===
In the US, the 2016 model year received a thorough facelift including new front and rear bumpers, headlamps, and tail lamps, reshaped Zero Gravity front seats, steering wheel, and central console. The car was built with new cabin silencing materials, and new sound-reducing windshield. A new SR trim level was also introduced. The 3.5 SR was dropped for the 2018 model year, leaving the 2.5 SR as the only available SR trim level. 

For 2018, the 2.5 SR trim level in the US received two new &quot;Special Edition&quot; packages, which are the 2.5 SR Special Edition and the 2.5 SR Midnight Edition.

Also for 2018, the previously-base 2.5 trim was discontinued, which now meant that the 2.5 S became the new &quot;base&quot; trim of the Altima. The NissanConnect Infotainment System is revised, adding in the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and a redesigned user interface.

The facelifted Teana was launched in China in July 2016 and Thailand in November 2018. The Thai-market facelifted Teana retained the pre-facelift Teana rear end.

===Reception===
In a 2012 comparison test by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in the US, the Nissan Altima 2.5 SV came in fourth place out of six cars behind the first place Volkswagen Passat, second place Honda Accord, and third place Ford Fusion.

This was followed by a third-place showing in a comparison done by the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; team. This was a series of three comparison tests involving mid-size sedans. In this particular test, four cars were tested. It consisted of the all-new Ford Fusion and Honda Accord as well as the Nissan Altima. The Volkswagen Passat is included in the test as it won the first round of mid-sized sedan comparison. In that round, it won decisively against the Chevrolet Malibu, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata, and Kia Optima.
However, the Passat only managed last in the 2nd round being led by the Altima (3rd), Fusion (2nd) and the Accord (1st).
This is followed by the final round where the Mazda 6 won against the Honda Accord.

More recently, in a comparison test conducted by Edmunds.com, the Nissan Altima beat out the Honda Accord and the Mazda6 to win 1st place. It is stated that the Altima is good in almost everything with only minor deficiencies. It drives well, entertaining on twisty roads, has comfortable seats, and remains quiet on highways. It is the least expensive but doesn&#x27;t feel like it. The mileage figures only add to its high appeal.

Since its launch, the Altima has accumulated several accolades including being named to Kelley Blue Book&#x27;s Top 10 best new sedans under $25,000, Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance best new model in class and Edmund&#x27;s top recommended sedans.

===Motorsports===

In 2012, Kelly Racing announced that it would enter four custom Nissan Altima race cars into the 2013 International V8 Supercars Championship. The car was revealed in October 2012 and was the first car to be homologated for the &quot;New Generation V8 Supercar&quot; regulations, which were to be used in the V8 Supercars Championship from 2013 onwards. It was the first time Nissan had raced in the series since 1992 when Nissan&#x27;s Skyline GT-R was forced out of racing due to regulation changes. The team has scored three race wins since moving to Nissan, with James Moffat in 2013, Michael Caruso in 2016 and Rick Kelly in 2018. Moffat and co-driver Taz Douglas finished on the podium at the 2014 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000, and the team has taken numerous other podium finishes.

2019 marked the last season in which Kelly Racing campaigned Altimas in the Supercars Championship.

The cars now campaign in the Dunlop Super2 Series by MW Motorsport.

== Sixth generation (L34; 2019) ==

The sixth-generation Altima debuted at the 2018 New York International Auto Show in March for the North American market, and in December 2018 for the Chinese market. Its design was previously previewed by the Nissan Vmotion 2.0 Concept, which was first showcased at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in January.

The sixth-generation Altima is available with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated direct-injected four-cylinder engine, with available all-wheel drive, or a 2.0-liter variable compression turbocharged four-cylinder engine (available for SR and Platinum models) that replaces the V6 powertrain in the previous generation. It is the world&#x27;s first production-ready variable compression turbo engine. All engines are mated to a continuous variable transmission.

The sixth generation Altima is equipped with Pro-Pilot Assist, Nissan Intelligent Around View Monitor, Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection System and Intelligent Lane Intervention. The car arrived at dealerships in the US in October 2018 and in Mexican Nissan dealerships in May 2019. In the US, the Altima is offered in five trim levels: S, SR, SV, SL, and Platinum. The base engine is available with all-wheel drive, the first for an Altima. An Edition One Special Edition model was offered exclusively to buyers who chose to pre-order their all-new Altima.

It began production in Nissan&#x27;s Smyrna plant on August 24, 2018, and in Canton, Mississippi, on September 27, 2018.

=== 2023 refresh ===
The facelifted Altima was unveiled on June 9, 2022, for the 2023 model year for the North American market. It features a redesigned front fascia with newly standard LED headlights and the automaker&#x27;s new logo. The Platinum trim (and some of its features, such as driver&#x27;s seat memory) was discontinued.

The interior of the Altima gets a new 12.3-inch touchscreen that&#x27;s standard on the SL and SR VC-Turbo and optional for the SV. It replaces the previous 8-inch option and adds wireless Apple CarPlay in the process (Android Auto still requires a wired connection). A wireless charging pad and Wi-Fi hotspot are available options as well. There are new standard safety gear includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, lane departure warning, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and high-beam assist.

In China, the Altima received a separate refreshed exterior design for the 2022 facelift. The Chinese market Altima also received a refreshed interior design. It was introduced in August 2022.

=== Reviews and reception ===
NY Daily News gave a 161/190 points score and an overall rating of 8.5 points to the vehicle; saying that &quot;The new Altima is better looking, better equipped, more technologically advanced, and more enjoyable to drive&quot;.

=== KR20DDT engine NHTSA investigation ===
On December 13, 2023, the NHTSA opened an investigation into customer complaints of engine failure in the Nissan&#x27;s &quot;KR15DDT&quot; and &quot;KR20DDET&quot; engines, the latter available as an option on the L34 Altima. The complaints allege engine failure, loss of motive power, engine knock, or noise and/or metal chunks and shavings being found in the oil pan of vehicles with these engines. The cause appears to be seizures and damages to the main bearings and L-links. Nissan stated that they are attempting to address these failures by changing their manufacturing process.

=== Safety ===
The 2019 Altima received a Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS and not a &quot;Plus&quot; award.

==Awards and recognition==
* 2002 North American Car of the Year.
* 2010 Altima Received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s Highest Front-Impact Crash Safety Rating (five stars).
* 2017 Nissan Altima named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. 
*2019 Nissan Altima named a finalist of the 2019 Green Car of the Year® by the Green Car Journal.
== Sales ==
In the past, about a third of Nissan Altima&#x27;s sales in the U.S. went to rental fleets. High percentage of fleet sales is found to hit both used-car values and brand image negatively.

<text>The Ryan Aeronautical Company was founded by T. Claude Ryan in San Diego, California, in 1934. It became part of Teledyne in 1969, and of Northrop Grumman when the latter company purchased Ryan in 1999. Ryan built several historically and technically significant aircraft, including four innovative V/STOL designs, but its most successful production aircraft was the Ryan Firebee line of unmanned drones used as target drones and unmanned air vehicles.

==History==
=== Early history ===
In 1922, T.C. Ryan founded a flying service in San Diego that would lead to several aviation ventures bearing the Ryan name, including Ryan Airline Company founded in 1925.

T.C. Ryan, whose previous companies were best known for building Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, actually had no part in building the famous aircraft. Ryan had been owner or partner in several previous companies, one of which also bore the name Ryan Aeronautical. The &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was not built by the final Ryan Aeronautical entity.

The new company&#x27;s first aircraft was the S-T Sport Trainer, a low-wing tandem-seat monoplane with a Menasco B-4 Pirate straight-4 engine. Five were built before production switched to the Ryan ST-A Aerobatic with a more powerful Menasco C-4 in 1935. This aircraft now had enough power for aerobatic display, and it won the 1937 International Aerobatic Championships. A further improved ST-A Special was built in 1936, with a supercharged Menasco C-4S.

In 1937 and 1938, a second civilian aircraft model was introduced, the S-C Sport Coupe, or SC-W with a Warner Super Scarab radial engine. The SC-W was a larger three-seater aircraft with a sliding canopy and side-by-side front seating. The prototype SC-M was originally powered by a Menasco C-4 inline engine, however testing revealed that more power was needed. Thirteen examples of the SC-W were built, although the last one was assembled from surplus parts decades after the initial production run was finished.

=== USAAC trainers ===

Interest from the United States Army Air Corps followed. The Menasco engines proved unreliable, and instead Kinner radial engines were fitted. Aircraft were produced as the PT-16 (15 built); PT-20 (30 built); PT-21 (100 USAAF, 100 USN); and finally as the definitive PT-22 Recruit (1,048 built) ordered in 1941 as pilot training began its rapid expansion.

Ryan also pioneered STOL techniques in its YO-51 Dragonfly liaison and observation craft, but only three were built.

=== Postwar ===

In the immediate postwar years, Ryan bought the rights to the Navion light aircraft from North American Aviation, selling it to both military and civilian customers.

Ryan became involved in the missile and unmanned aircraft fields, developing the Ryan Firebee unmanned target drone, the Ryan Firebird (the first American air-to-air missile) among others, as well as a number of experimental and research aircraft.

Ryan acquired a 50% stake in Continental Motors Corporation, the aircraft-engine builder, in 1965.

In the 1950s, Ryan was a pioneer in jet vertical flight with the X-13 Vertijet, a tail-sitting jet with a delta wing which was not used in production designs. In the early 1960s, Ryan built the XV-5 Vertifan for the U.S. Army, which used wing- and nose-mounted lift vanes for V/STOL vertical flight. Other Ryan V/STOL designs included the VZ-3 Vertiplane.

Ryan developed the highly accurate radar system used on the Apollo Lunar Module.

In 1968, the company was acquired by Teledyne for $128 million and a year later became a wholly owned subsidiary of that company as Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical Company.

Northrop Grumman purchased Teledyne Ryan in 1999, with the products continuing to form the core of that firm&#x27;s unmanned aerial vehicle efforts.

<doc id="614455" wikidata="Q10196" url="?curid=614455" title="Aranese dialect">
<text>Aranese () is a standardized form of the Pyrenean Gascon variety of the Occitan language spoken in the Val d&#x27;Aran, in northwestern Catalonia close to the Spanish border with France, where it is one of the three official languages beside Catalan and Spanish. In 2010, it was declared the third official language in Catalonia by the Parliament of Catalonia.

The official names of towns in Val d&#x27;Aran are in Occitan; for example, the municipality of &quot;Vielha&quot; is known by its Occitan name on maps and road signs, rather than its Catalan/Spanish name, &quot;Viella&quot;.

==Official status==
The Aran Valley is the only territory in the language domain of Occitania where Occitan has official recognition and institutional protection. According to Law 35/2010 passed by the Parliament of Catalonia, Occitan is considered an official language not only in Val d&#x27;Aran, but in all of Catalonia, and is given precedence in the territory where it is spoken (Val d&#x27;Aran).

Article 3.4 of Catalonia&#x27;s 1979 Statute of Autonomy establishes that the &quot;Aranese language will be the object of education and of special respect and protection.&quot; Subsequently, Law 7/1983, on linguistic normalization, declares Aranese the language of Aran, proclaims certain linguistic rights of the Aranese and directs public service to guarantee its usage and teaching. Aranese is taught on all levels of compulsory education and has been the medium of instruction in the Aran Valley since 1984.

A certain degree of autonomy was granted to the Aran Valley in 1990. Law 16/1990, concerning the special regime of the Val d&#x27;Aran, grants to the Valley an administrative autonomy. This law affirms the official status of Aranese, further guarantees its use and teaching, and affirms the general mandate to promote its normalization in Aran.

Law 1/1998, on linguistic policy, includes specific provisions related to place names, anthroponymy, and the media. Although the localities of Catalonia have their official names in Catalan, the localities of the Aran Valley have their official names in Occitan. Thus, the indicators of the towns and the names of their streets are written in this language. Since May 2001, there is an official regulation of the General Council of Aran that promulgates the certification system of the different levels of knowledge of Occitan.

In 2006, a new Statute of Autonomy was promulgated in Catalonia. Concerning Aranese, article 6.5 of the organic law establishes that &quot;the Occitan language, called Aranese in Aran, is the language of this territory and is official in Catalonia, in accordance with the provisions of this Statute and the laws of linguistic normalization.&quot; In 2010, Law 35/2010 was subsequently passed, with specific provisions concerning Occitan in Catalonia reflecting the new constitutional framework.

In 2011, the Spanish Government, specifically that of the Popular Party and Citizens, opposed the preference given to Aranese by the 2010 law, questioning the constitutionality of articles 2.3, 5.4, 5.7 and 6.5. In 2018, the constitutional court ruled that while article 2.3 was found to be constitutional, the &quot;preferential&quot; status given found in the other concerned articles are unconstitutional.

==Usage==
According to a 2001 linguistic census by the Aranese government, about 90% of the inhabitants of Val d&#x27;Aran can understand the language, with those between 25 and 34 years old having the lowest rate, at around 80% (excluding those under the age of 4). Between 60 and 65% of the population can speak it; however, only 26% reported being able to write in Aranese.

In 2008, the Generalitat of Catalonia surveyed the population (15 years old or older) in the Val d&#x27;Aran. The survey reported that 78.2% of the population could understand Aranese, 56.8% could speak it, 59.4% could read it, and 34.8% could write the language. The number of people that can speak Aranese grew to the 61% of the population in 2020, according to a survey of the Public Office for the Occitan Language.

Once considered to be an endangered language spoken mainly by older people, it is now experiencing a renaissance; it enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Spanish within Val d&#x27;Aran, and since 1984 has been taught bilingually alongside Spanish in schools. Students in the Val d&#x27;Aran are required to have two hours each of Spanish, Catalan, and Aranese per week. At some levels of education, a foreign language is added to the three official languages —usually French due to proximity— and sometimes even two additional hours of English.

=== Comparison to other Romance languages ===
==Orthography==

===Digraphs===
===Vowels===
==Loanwords==
Since the Val d&#x27;Aran is located within Spanish and Catalan territory, Aranese is subject to certain influences from Spanish and Catalan. As such, Aranese has adopted several neologisms from them:

*&quot;actuar&quot; (vs. &quot;agir&quot;)
*&quot;empresa&quot; (vs. &quot;entrepresa&quot;)
*&quot;increment&quot; (vs. &quot;aumentacion&quot;)
*&quot;laborau&quot; (vs. &quot;professionau&quot;)
*&quot;matrícula&quot; (vs. &quot;inscripcion&quot;)
*&quot;oficina&quot; (vs. &quot;burèu&quot;, which is a Gallicism)

Spanish and Catalan have also created deformations of words such as &quot;abans&quot; &gt; &quot;abantes&quot; or &quot;dempús&quot; &gt; &quot;despuès&quot;. Some Hispanicisms are directly adopted into Aranese: &quot;hasta&quot;.

==Regulation==
Aranese is regulated under classic unifying standards of Occitan, defined initially by Loís Alibèrt. These standards of the Conselh de la Lenga Occitana (Occitan Language Council) have officially been recognized by the Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran (General Council of Aran) since 1999.

In practice, several details standards diverge due to the popular or preferred usage of Aranese, in relation to other Gascon varieties. For instance:
* the form of the feminine plural -AS in general Gascon is replaced with -ES in Aranese, as the pronunciation is &quot;/es/&quot;. Ex: &quot;hemnes araneses &quot;(Aranese women) in place of general Gascon &quot;hemnas aranesas &quot;
* the accepted use of U in place of V in a good deal of the Valley (but some retain the &quot;v&quot; as it is pronounced /b/) Ex: &quot;auer&quot; instead of &quot;aver&quot; (general Gascon always write it &quot;v&quot; even when pronounced /w/).

The Institut d&#x27;Estudis Aranesi is the recognized language academy by the Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran.

== Written publications ==
=== Grammar ===
A reference on usage and conjugation of Aranese verbs entitled &quot;Es Vèrbs conjugadi : morfologia verbau aranesa&quot; was written by Verònica Barés Moga and published in 2003. A descriptive and normative reference grammar book, written in Aranese by Aitor Carrera, was published in March 2007. It includes a detailed breakdown of phonological and grammatical differences between varieties of Aranese in different villages in the valley.

=== Dictionaries ===
A dictionary of Aranese was written by the Catalan linguist Joan Coromines as his doctoral thesis.

A simple four-language Spanish–Aranese–Catalan–French dictionary exists, written by Frederic Vergés Bartau (see Bibliography).

An Aranese-English and English–Aranese dictionary was published in 2006. It was written by Ryan Furness, a young man from Minnesota, after he became curious about the language when he traveled to Val d&#x27;Aran.

A detailed one-volume Catalan–Occitan and Occitan–Catalan dictionary was published under the auspices of the governments of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya) and Val d&#x27;Aran (Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran). Although it calls the language &quot;Occitan&quot;, it uses Aranese spelling and its preface says that special attention is given to the Aranese variety.

=== Periodicals and commercial publications ===
A local monthly magazine &quot;Toti&quot; and local newspapers are published partly in the language. The online newspaper &quot;Jornalet&quot; also publishes a fair deal of articles and opinions in Aranese.

<text>The Far Eastern Federal District (, Latinized: Dal&#x27;nevostochnyy federal&#x27;nyy okrug) is the largest of the eight federal districts of Russia, but the least populated, with a population of around 8 million (73.6% urban) according to the 2021 Census. The federal district lies entirely within the easternmost part of Asia and is coextensive with the Russian Far East.

==History==
The Far Eastern Federal District was established on 13 May 2000 by President Vladimir Putin. It is currently governed by presidential envoy Yury Trutnev. In November 2018, Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai were added to the federal district. The seat of the Far Eastern Federal District was moved from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok in December 2018.

On 15 July 2022, the first high-speed highway was opened in the Far Eastern Federal District. It united three federal highwaysUssuri (KhabarovskVladivostok), Amur (ChitaKhabarovsk) and Vostok (KhabarovskNakhodka), and connect the regional capital with Komsomolsk-on-Amur, as well as sites of the territory of the advancing socio-economic development (SAD).

==Demographics==
===Federal subjects===

=== Largest cities with a population over 75,000 ===
There are 82 cities in the Far Eastern Federal District, and 13 cities have populations over 75,000.

Only four of these 13 cities (Komsomolsk-on-Amur (7th) in Khabarovsk Krai, Ussuriysk (9th), Nakhodka (11th), Artyom (12th) in Primorsky Krai) are not administrative centres of a federal subject. Anadyr, the centre of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is one of the smallest centres of a federal subject (it has only 13,045 inhabitants). Only Magas, the centre of Ingushetia, is smaller than Anadyr.

Artyom is a large suburb of the Vladivostok metropolitan area.

Populations are given as of the 2021 census:
#Khabarovsk: 617,441
#Vladivostok: 603,519
#Ulan-Ude: 437,565
#Yakutsk: 355,443
#Chita: 334,427
#Blagoveshchensk: 241,437
#Komsomolsk-on-Amur: 238,505
#Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk: 181,587
#Ussuriysk: 180,393
#Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky: 164,900
#Nakhodka: 139,931
#Artyom: 109,556
#Magadan: 90,757

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 27.4% of the population of the current federal subjects of the Far Eastern Federal District (including Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai) adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 5.0% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1.4% is an Orthodox believer without belonging to any church or adheres to other (non-Russian) Orthodox churches, 3.3% is an adherent of Buddhism, 0.7% is an adherent of Islam, and 2.2% adhere to some native faith such as Rodnovery, Tengrism, Yellow shamanism, or Black shamanism. In addition, 27.0% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 23.5% is atheist, and 9.5% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

<text>Carl Wilhelm Richard Hülsenbeck (aka Charles R. Hulbeck) (23 April 189220 April 1974) was a German writer, poet, and psychoanalyst born in Frankenau, Hessen-Nassau who was associated with the formation of the Dada movement.

==Life and work==
After attending the Gymnasium am Ostring in Bochum, Huelsenbeck became a medical student on the eve of World War I. He was invalided out of the army and emigrated to Zürich, Switzerland in February 1916, where he fell in with the Cabaret Voltaire. In January 1917, he moved to Berlin, taking with him the ideas and techniques which helped him found the Berlin Dada group. &#x27;To make literature with a gun in my hand had for a time been my dream,&#x27; he wrote in 1920.

Huelsenbeck was the editor of the &quot;Dada Almanach&quot;, and wrote &quot;Dada siegt&quot;, &quot;En Avant Dada&quot; and other Dadaist works. Huelsenbeck&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Dada Drummer&quot; gives detailed accounts of his interactions with many key figures of the movement.

Huelsenbeck&#x27;s ideas fitted in with left-wing politics current at the time in Berlin. However idealistic Huelsenbeck and his companions were, their challenge Dada is German Bolshevism had unfortunate repercussions later, when the National Socialists denounced all aspects of modern art as &quot;Kunstbolschewismus&quot;. Beginning in 1933, Huelsenbeck was repeatedly investigated by the Nazi authorities. He was forbidden to write and rather than remaining in &#x27;exile&#x27;, he managed to get an immigration visa to the United States in 1936. He changed his name to Charles R. Hulbeck and practiced medicine and psychoanalysis at the Karen Horney Clinic in Long Island, New York. In 1970 he returned to the Ticino region of Switzerland.

Of his music, Hugo Ball wrote, &quot;Huelsenbeck has arrived. He pleads for an intensification of rhythm (Negro rhythm). He would best love to drum literature &amp; to .&quot;

Until the end of his life, Huelsenbeck insisted, &quot;Dada is still existing,&quot; although the movement&#x27;s other founders might not have agreed.

<text>Nerene Virgin (December 27, 1946 – January 15, 2024) was a Canadian journalist, actress, educator, author and television host, best known for her role on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;.

== Background ==
Virgin was born in Hamilton, Ontario. She was a great-granddaughter of escaped Maryland slave Thomas John (Howard) Holland, and great-niece of pastor John Christie Holland. She was born Nerene Grizzle, daughter of Kathleen V. Toliver and Stanley G. Grizzle. After growing up in Toronto, she attended Toronto Teacher&#x27;s College. Virgin was also certified as a Special Education teacher at Brock University focusing on intellectually gifted children and held special qualifications in teaching Integrated Arts. Virgin began her career as a teacher, working for the Toronto Board of Education. She later moved into children&#x27;s programming with Ontario&#x27;s public broadcaster TV Ontario, playing &quot;Jodie&quot; on &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;. This internationally acclaimed series was in production for seven years. Virgin also had recurring roles on other television programs, including &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, &quot;Night Heat&quot; and &quot;Ramona&quot;. Initially, Virgin had played the role of Ellie the dispatch girl on &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, a CTV series originally named &quot;Dr. Simon Locke&quot;. She appeared in numerous film roles such as &quot;Gotti&quot;, &quot;The Undergrads&quot;, &quot;Murder in Space&quot;, and &quot;Right of the People&quot;. Virgin&#x27;s entertainment career began as a singer with the Tiaras, a Toronto-based girl group. Virgin joined Colina Phillips and Patricia Grizzle after Brenda Russell had left the trio and moved to Los Angeles.

Virgin worked as the weather and community reporter for CBOT, the local CBC Television station in Ottawa, in the late 1980s. She then worked at CTV station CFTO in Toronto as the host of &quot;Eye on Toronto&quot;, co-host for the entertainment show &quot;Showbuz&quot;, and a host on CTV&#x27;s annual &quot;Miracle Network Telethon&quot; for the Hospital for Sick Children.

In 1996, Virgin became the host for the daily national current affairs show &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; for CBC Newsworld in Calgary, Alberta. She returned to Toronto as the anchor to launch the national weekend newscast &quot;Saturday Report&quot; for CBC Television. She then moved to the anchor chair at Newsworld International until it was dismantled and taken over by Al Gore&#x27;s Current TV in July 2005. Virgin then chose to leave CBC to complete further studies, gaining certification in teaching ESL (English as a Second Language) and taught students in Linhe, Inner Mongolia, China. She later taught French in Stoney Creek.

Virgin served on the board of directors for Phoenix Place, a second stage home for women and children who have survived domestic violence. She was also a member, and part of the executive, of the council for the College of Early Childhood Educators, the first such college in North America. Virgin served as a member of Hamilton&#x27;s Committee Against Racism for the 2010–2014 and 2014-2018 Term of Council.

Virgin died in Burlington, Ontario on January 15, 2024, of unspecified causes at the age of 77. She is survived by her husband Alan Smith, daughters Yvette and Nicole, and son Thomas.

== Black History work ==
Virgin applied her educational background and journalism skills to research, write and present stories of notable Blacks in Canadian and U.S. history. She published biographies of Charles Victor Roman, Charles Lightfoot Roman and Rev. John Christie Holland with Historica Canada. These articles have been published in &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;. Nerene worked with the Dundas Museum and Archives to nominate C. V. Roman as a laureate to the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. She worked with the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board to embed Black History into the regular school curriculum. Virgin&#x27;s educational presentations were often based on the exploits of her great-great grandfather, Private Lewis Toliver and his eleven-year service in the “All Coloured Militia” during the Upper Canada Rebellion 1837–38 and the building of the Second Welland Canal. This endeavor was a pilot project for the Ministry of Education.

== Political career ==
Virgin first sought political office in 2007 in the federal riding of Hamilton Mountain, but she later withdrew from the race. She then decided to seek political office in Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, even though she resided outside the riding boundaries. In 2016, she was named one of Canada&#x27;s 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women in history.

On July 31, 2007, after using a three-member panel interview process, the Ontario Liberal Party announced that Virgin had been acclaimed as the candidate in Hamilton East—Stoney Creek for the 2007 provincial election. The panel consisted of incumbent MPP Jennifer Mossop (who did not seek reelection), a party organizer, and the riding president. The decision to appoint Virgin upset some local Liberal party members, but Virgin expressed optimism in being able to reach out to the grassroots. Mossop, the Stoney Creek incumbent MPP at the time, is also a former television journalist.

In the aftermath of Virgin&#x27;s acclamation as a candidate, she was racially slurred and allegedly misrepresented in the media, with the &quot;Hamilton Community News&quot;, a weekly newspaper in Hamilton, referring to her as a &quot;tar baby&quot;. While the paper issued an apology for its use of the pejorative term, Virgin indicated that the paper should do more than just apologize, suggesting setting up a scholarship, or a program designed to address racism and discrimination. Virgin sued Metroland Media Group due to that racial slur. She was represented by lawyers Kikelola Roach, Charles Roach and Julian Porter. The newspaper settled the lawsuit to Virgin&#x27;s satisfaction.

On election day, Virgin finished second to New Democrat candidate Paul Miller.

== Electoral record ==

On May 2, 2016, it was announced that Virgin was named one of Canada’s 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women. Previously, in February 2012, she was honored for Professional Achievement and had received a Rev. John C. Holland Award, an award named after her great uncle John Christie Holland. Virgin also received an Illuminesence Award in 2014. Virgin was in her mid-teens when she was crowned Miss Sepia Toronto. She had expected that this would lead her to be a contestant in the Miss Canada Pageant but was later told that, at that time, apparently a black girl would not be allowed to compete.

<text>Maurice LaMarche (born March 30, 1958) is a Canadian voice actor. He has voiced The Brain in &quot;Animaniacs&quot; as well as its spin-off &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, Big Bob in &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; (1996–2004), the title character from Inspector Gadget, and a variety of characters in &quot;Futurama&quot;, including Kif Kroker. He also voiced Egon Spengler in &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;.

==Early life==
LaMarche was born in 1958 in Toronto, Ontario, on March 30, 1958, to Guy LaMarche and Linda Bourdon. His family moved to Timmins, Ontario shortly after he was born and moved back to Toronto when he was around 4. LaMarche&#x27;s childhood was filled with his &quot;own little world of cartoons and sixties television&quot;. It was in his second year of high school that he learned of the popularity his talent for mimicry could garner him. This realization came from a coincidental performance in a high school &quot;variety night&quot; when a couple of friends urged him to enter. The act he performed at the variety night was &quot;celebrities as waiters&quot; which he used until the end of his stand-up career.

One of his neighbours was comedian Mike Myers.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===

At the age of nineteen, LaMarche took his high school act to an open mic night in New York City, performing to a reaction in which, as he describes, &quot;they just totally ignored me&quot;. This reaction was coupled with the criticism LaMarche received from fellow Canadian comedians who LaMarche describes as discouraging him from pursuing a career outside of Canada. He returned to Canada, continued to do stand-up, and also started a career in voice work.

Three years later, LaMarche moved to Los Angeles to further his stand-up career. This move, LaMarche says, would always be something he regretted doing instead of moving to New York: &quot;... in retrospect, I thought it was a mistake. I think that a couple of years in New York would have made me a stronger comedian.&quot;

Over the next five years, LaMarche&#x27;s career progressed, playing comedy clubs throughout the US, with several appearances on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;An Evening At The Improv&quot;. In spite of such interest, LaMarche believed that, while his impersonations and stage presence were professional, he needed to develop funnier comedy material. LaMarche was asked to be part of the 1985 HBO production &quot;Rodney Dangerfield Hosts the 9th Annual Young Comedians Special&quot;, on which Bob Saget, Rita Rudner, Louie Anderson, Yakov Smirnoff also appeared, and included the breakout first appearance of Sam Kinison. Although he was received and reviewed favourably, in looking back on his own performance in that special, LaMarche believed he was &quot;probably about five years away from going from being a good comedian to being a great comedian&quot; and being the &quot;only impressionist that actually comes from somewhere&quot;.

During his standup career, LaMarche opened for such acts as Rodney Dangerfield, George Carlin, Howie Mandel, David Sanborn, and Donna Summer, usually in the main showrooms of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

On March 9, 1987, LaMarche&#x27;s father was murdered, shot to death by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into depression and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on January 20, 1989, LaMarche returned to stand-up comedy in the early part of 1990. As he was regaining self-confidence, his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year. At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided to retire from stand-up comedy. He said, &quot;at that point I just threw up my hands and went, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t have any funny left in me. I&#x27;m done&#x27;&quot;.

===Voice acting===
====Early Canadian work====
LaMarche&#x27;s entry into the voiceover industry was in 1980 in &quot;Easter Fever&quot; and &quot;Take Me Up to the Ball Game&quot;, two animated Canadian TV specials from Nelvana. He also was a regular voice performer on Toronto&#x27;s pioneering cult TV hit &quot;The All-Night Show&quot;, which debuted in September 1980; a continuing feature had the lips of LaMarche inserted into a photograph of a famous person, and having LaMarche imitate that person to deliver a show promo or announcement. When LaMarche left the show in 1981, Jim Carrey was recruited to take his place as a voice actor.

====Television====

It took a few years after his 1981 move to Los Angeles for LaMarche to establish himself in the American voiceover industry, which he initially pursued as a side endeavor during his full-time standup comedy career. LaMarche began on &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; with that show&#x27;s second season in 1985, and went on to &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Popeye and Son&quot; and &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; where he played Egon Spengler. After &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, LaMarche became a regular mainstay of the voiceover industry, appearing in such shows as &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;GI Joe&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Bonkers&quot; before landing perhaps his most recognized role in 1993 as The Brain on &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and later its spin-off show &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. Following this, LaMarche worked on &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, and &quot;The Tick&quot; before then reprising his role of Egon in &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;. The stretch of two years after this saw LaMarche portray characters in such shows as &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; as Big Bob Pataki, &quot;Queer Duck&quot;, and &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot;. During this time LaMarche became the voice actor for Mortimer Mouse, whom he voiced in the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. It was at this time, 1999, that LaMarche began work on &quot;Futurama&quot;, and since &quot;Futurama&quot;, he has continued to work steadily in television, including guest roles on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (where he once again parodied Orson Welles). His most recent regular role came as Hovis the butler on the Nickelodeon series &quot;Catscratch&quot;. LaMarche was the voice of antagonist Father in &quot;&quot; and was also the voice of Victor in Playhouse Disney&#x27;s &quot;Handy Manny&quot; 2007 Halloween episode. He also played the voice role of Grumpy in the 2014 Disney XD series &quot;The 7D&quot;, a reimagining of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.

LaMarche has done various voice work for many Warner Bros. Animation and DiC Entertainment cartoons. He also delivered the protracted belches for the &quot;Great Wakkorotti&quot; shorts on &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, in which Wakko Warner performed various pieces of music. One of those belches was later recycled for Buddy in 2003&#x27;s New Line Cinema film &quot;Elf&quot;. In 2011, LaMarche reprised his role as Yosemite Sam in Cartoon Network&#x27;s new series, &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, and its spin-off, &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;.

LaMarche made several appearances in &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; where he voiced Chancellor Neighsay.

====&quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;====
LaMarche plays the character of The Brain in both &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and the spin-off. In creating the voice for Brain, LaMarche says he looked at a picture of the character and immediately thought of Orson Welles, although the character was not modeled after Welles. Voicing Brain gave LaMarche the opportunity to make use of his signature impersonation of Welles. Many &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; episodes are nods to Welles&#x27; career. LaMarche won an Annie Award for his role as the Brain, and was nominated for an Emmy. LaMarche later used this accent to voice Father in &quot;&quot;.

====&quot;The Critic&quot;====
While working on &quot;The Critic&quot;, LaMarche once voiced 29 characters in one 30-minute episode.

His time on &quot;The Critic&quot; also afforded LaMarche the opportunity to once again parody Orson Welles, this time after a video reading of a will (the Sherman family was so wealthy, they had hired Welles to narrate it) dissolves into a commercial for Mrs. Pells Fishsticks, as well as another for Rosebud Frozen Peas (&quot;full of count-ry goodness and green pea-ness&quot;), and another for Blotto Bros. wine. He also occasionally served as an uncredited fill-in for main cast member Jon Lovitz as Jay Sherman.

====&quot;Futurama&quot;====

Much of his best known voice work is from &quot;Futurama&quot; where he voiced Zapp Brannigan&#x27;s beleaguered assistant Kif Kroker, melodramatic soap acting unit Calculon, the Nero-esque Hedonismbot, Morbo the news anchor, and Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, among numerous others. He has also done his Orson Welles impression on the show, winning a 2011 Outstanding Voice-Over Performance Emmy for his portrayal of Lrrr and Orson Welles in the episode &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;. He won another Emmy the following year for the episode &quot;The Silence of the Clamps&quot;.

====&quot;Heroes&quot;====
LaMarche acted, voice only, in the second episode of the hit NBC show &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, as the villain Sylar. His voice is heard in a recorded phone conversation on Chandra Suresh&#x27;s answering machine. The role of Sylar was later played by Zachary Quinto.

===Film===
LaMarche appeared in many films, including dubbing the voice of Orson Welles over Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s on-camera performance in &quot;Ed Wood&quot;; Pepé Le Pew in &quot;Space Jam&quot;; supplying the voice of the Alec Baldwin puppet in &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, and reprising his roles from &quot;Queer Duck&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot; in the direct-to-video films &quot;Queer Duck: The Movie&quot; and &quot;&quot;, respectively. More recently, LaMarche was the voice of Mr. Big, the Tundratown crimeboss in Disney&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Zootopia&quot;.

His one on-camera theatrical film performance was in the 1981 Canadian feature &quot;Funny Farm&quot;, not to be confused with a later Chevy Chase vehicle of the same name. The film follows the story of a young standup comedian&#x27;s attempt to break into the big-time on the L.A. comedy scene. LaMarche played Dickie Lyons, an impressionist who befriends the main character, Mark Champlin. The film also starred Howie Mandel, Eileen Brennan, and Miles Chapin.

In Mark Hamill&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot;, LaMarche made a rare live appearance to be in the special features of the DVD alongside &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; co-star Rob Paulsen. Among other gags, he re-enacted his impression of Orson Welles&#x27; famous frozen peas commercial outtake.

===Commercials===
LaMarche has also lent his voice to commercials. He voiced Kellogg&#x27;s Froot Loops spokesbird Toucan Sam, the animated Willy Wonka character in Nestlé&#x27;s &quot;Willy Wonka Candy Company&quot; commercials, and the narrator for Lexus commercials. He has also appeared as himself, doing the voice of Popeye the Sailor for the Long John Silver&#x27;s restaurant chain in the early 1990s, reprising the role from the TV series &quot;Popeye &amp; Son&quot;.

On 8 September 2018, LaMarche was featured in the commercial for the open world driving game &quot;Forza Horizon 4&quot;.

===Theme parks===
LaMarche provided the voice of Yosemite Sam for the &quot;Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure!&quot; dark ride at Six Flags Over Texas, which opened in 1992.

==Personal life==
LaMarche has been married to Robin G. Eisenman since May 19, 1991; together they have a son, Jonathan.

<text>The Pterophoridae or plume moths are a family of Lepidoptera with unusually modified wings, giving them the shape of a narrow winged airplane. Though they belong to the Apoditrysia like the larger moths and the butterflies, unlike these they are tiny and were formerly included among the assemblage called &quot;microlepidoptera&quot;.

==Description and ecology==

The forewings of plume moths usually consist of two curved spars with more or less bedraggled bristles trailing behind. This resembles the closely related Alucitidae (many-plumed moths) at first glance, but the latter have a greater number of symmetrical plumes. The hindwings are similarly constructed, but have three spars. This unorthodox structure does not prevent flight. A few genera have normal lepidopteran wings.

The usual resting posture is with the wings extended laterally and narrowly rolled up. Often they resemble a piece of dried grass, and may pass unnoticed by potential predators even when resting in exposed situations in daylight. Some species have larvae which are stem- or root-borers while others are leaf-browsers.
Economically important pterophorids include the artichoke plume moth (&quot;Platyptilia carduidactyla&quot;), an artichoke (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot;) pest in California, while the geranium plume moth (&quot;Platyptilia pica&quot;) and the snapdragon plume moth (&quot;Stenoptilodes antirrhina&quot;) can cause damage to the ornamental plants garden geranium (&quot;Pelargonium x hortorum&quot;) and common snapdragon (&quot;Antirrhinum majus&quot;), respectively. Other plume moths have been used as biological control agents against invasive plant species – &quot;Lantanophaga pusillidactyla&quot; against West Indian lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;), &quot;Oidaematophorus beneficus&quot; against mistflower (&quot;Ageratina riparia&quot;), &quot;Hellinsia balanotes&quot; against groundsel bush (&quot;Baccharis halimifolia&quot;), and &quot;Wheeleria spilodactylus&quot; against horehound (&quot;Marrubium vulgare&quot;).

== Evolution ==
A fossil species from the extant genus &quot;Merrifieldia&quot; is known from the Oligocene of France.

==Taxonomy==
The small group of moths in the genus &quot;Agdistopis&quot; has often been treated as a subfamily Macropiratinae within the Pterophoridae, but recent research indicates that this group should be considered a separate family. Around 1580 accepted species are currently accepted for the Pterophoridae.

The family is divided into the following subfamilies, tribes and genera, some species are also listed:

<doc id="614477" wikidata="Q268155" url="?curid=614477" title="The Crimson Ghost">
<text>The Crimson Ghost is a 1946 American film serial directed by Fred C. Brannon and William Witney. Produced by Republic Pictures and written by Albert DeMond, Basil Dickey, Jesse Duffy, and Sol Shor, it was the last serial directed by Witney. It is divided into twelve chapters and stars Charles Quigley as a criminologist who attempts to thwart the efforts of the eponymous villain to steal a device that can render electrical devices powerless. The serial also stars Linda Stirling, Clayton Moore, and I. Stanford Jolley.

In the 1950s, the serial was re-edited as a six-episode television series, and in 1966, it was and as a television film titled Cyclotrode &quot;X&quot;. By the 1990s, &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was one of two Republic serials to be colorized.

The serial&#x27;s titular villain, the Crimson Ghost, has become a pop-culture icon due to the punk rock band Misfits having adapted his skull-like visage into their iconography.

==Plot==

The masked Crimson Ghost is determined to steal the Cyclotrode X, a device designed to repel atomic bomb attacks and that can disable electrical devices. Its inventor, university professor Dr. Chambers, demonstrates its powers at a faculty meeting by having it detect and fell a model airplane. After the meeting, two of the Ghost&#x27;s henchmen attempt to steal the device, but Chambers destroys it to prevent them from doing so. Criminologist Duncan Richards, a colleague of Chambers, arrives and fights the henchmen. One of them, Ashe, escapes, and the other is killed when a collar around his neck is removed. Chambers informs his fellow professors—Richards, Anderson, Van Wyck, Maxwell, and Parker—that a duplicate Cyclotrode is located in a bonded warehouse.

Chambers finds himself in the mansion hideout of the Ghost, who tells Chambers that he is one of his fellow professors and forces him to wear a collar that will compel him to do his will and is designed to kill the wearer if forcefully removed. Chambers, under the Ghost&#x27;s control, retrieves the duplicate Cyclotrode from the warehouse. Richards pursues them by car. The Ghost commands Chambers to use the Cyclotrode to impede Richards&#x27; car, and Richards narrowly avoids being sent hurtling off a cliff.

Back in his mansion hideout, the Ghost relieves Chambers of his influence and tells him to make a larger, more powerful Cyclotrode that could cripple entire cities. Instead, Chambers builds a death ray and sets it as a trap. Richards finds his way to the lair and almost steps into the path of the death ray; Chambers leaps forward to stop him and is killed by the weapon. Upon learning of Chambers&#x27; death, the Ghost decides to build a larger Cyclotrode himself.

After unsuccessfully attempting to steal heavy water (a compound integral to the Cyclotrode&#x27;s operation) and a truckload of refined uranium (an ingredient he would need to make heavy water himself), the Ghost has his henchmen capture Diana, a secretary who has been assisting Richards in his efforts to combat them. The Ghost places a control collar on her, and she returns to the university. Richards notices the collar around her neck, and attempts to remove it with the help of a doctor and a nurse. Richards is able to remove the collar without killing Diana, and discovers that the doctor who is present is actually Ashe in disguise.

Ashe manages to escape, and flees by car to the Ghost&#x27;s mountain hideout. There, in a laboratory, scientist Bain has devised a way to make heavy water without uranium. Richards tracks them down to the hideout, and a fight ensues. A fire breaks out, and the Ghost and Ashe escape with a supply of heavy water. At the next faculty meeting, Richards announces that the wreckage of the Ghost&#x27;s laboratory equipment has been hauled to a warehouse and will be checked for fingerprints. Richards reveals to Diana that he does not actually intend for the wreckage to be checked for fingerprints, with his actual goal being to catch the Ghost.

At the warehouse, Richards and Diana find Professor Van Wyck, and wrongly assume him to be the Ghost. The real Ghost arrives and Van Wyck is killed in the melee. With Professor Anderson and Van Wyck now dead, Richards determines that either Maxwell or Parker must be the Ghost. Richards and Diana use a dog to track Ashe to the Ghost&#x27;s mansion hideout. Richards enters the estate, where the Ghost and his henchmen have constructed a larger Cyclotrode. Richards shoots the device and unmasks the Ghost. Back at the university, the captured Crimson Ghost is revealed to be Professor Parker.

==Production==

&quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was budgeted at $137,912, although the final negative cost was $161,174 (a $23,262, or 16.9%, overspend). It was the most expensive Republic serial of 1946. It was reportedly filmed between March 28 and April 24, 1946 under the working title &quot;The Scarlet Shadow&quot;. The serial&#x27;s production number was 1597.

In order to prevent the audience deducing the identity of the Crimson Ghost, I. Stanford Jolley, who portrayed the character Doctor Blackton on-screen, provided the voice of the Ghost. Jolley received fourth-billing and was therefore highly suspect. When the Crimson Ghost was unmasked in the twelfth and final chapter, he proved to be yet another actor entirely, Joseph Forte, who played Professor Parker.

&quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was director William Witney&#x27;s last serial. His first was &quot;The Painted Stallion&quot; in 1937 and prior to this production had temporarily left the serial business to serve in World War II.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot;&#x27;s official release date is considered October 26, 1946, the date that the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges.

===Television===
In the early 1950s, &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was one of fourteen Republic serials edited into a television series. It was broadcast in six 26½-minute episodes. &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-released as a film on television in 1966. The title of the film was changed to &quot;Cyclotrode &quot;X&quot;&quot;. This version was cut down to 100 minutes in length. &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; was one of two Republic serials to be colorized in the 1990s.

==Critical reception==
Hans J. Wollstein of AllMovie gave &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; a rating of three out of five stars, calling it &quot;one of the most entertaining serials to be released by Republic Pictures&quot;. Author William C. Cline praised the serial&#x27;s eponymous antagonist as &quot;a most striking and visually fascinating villain&quot;. Similarly, author Roy Kinnard praised the design of the Crimson Ghost&#x27;s costume, and called the character &quot;one of the single greatest menaces in serial history.&quot; Writing of the serial as a whole, Kinnard commented that &quot;Although &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; is a slick, well-made serial, it suffers from the same overall blandness that afflicted most Republic serial from the mid-&#x27;40s on.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Crimson Ghost is popularly known as part of the iconography of the punk rock band Misfits. The Misfits first made use of the character&#x27;s likeness in a flyer promoting one of their gigs on March 28, 1979 at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, after vocalist Glenn Danzig and bassist Jerry Only came across a picture of the Crimson Ghost while searching for images to silkscreen on T-shirts. The band later incorporated an image of the Ghost on the cover artwork of their single &quot;Horror Business&quot;, first released on June 26, 1979. The Crimson Ghost became a recognizable mascot and logo for the band throughout their career, and has become somewhat of a pop culture icon as a result.

Iron Maiden have also used the Crimson Ghost in their &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; music video.

Full motion video clips from &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot; serial were used in the Philips CD-i video game &quot;Jack Sprite vs. The Crimson Ghost&quot;, released by OlderGames in 2002. The gameplay involved watching clips from the serial and injecting the Jack Sprite character into the scene At certain times for fighting levels, with the Crimson Ghost acting as a boss character.

<text>Semigallian or Zemgalian, was an East Baltic language of the Baltic language sub-family of the Indo-European languages.

== History ==
It was spoken in the northern part of Lithuania and southern regions of Latvia in what is known as Semigallia. It is thought that it was extinct by the 16th century, with the assimilation by the Latvians. Semigallian is known only from references to it in documents and texts from before the 16th century.

== Phonology ==
Semigallian shares some phonological similarities to Curonian and, to a lesser extent, Latvian. The Common Baltic , consonants became , in their soft varieties in Semigalian. All long vowels and diphthongs at the end of the word in Common Baltic were reduced to simple short vowels in Semigallian.

<doc id="614483" wikidata="Q375740" url="?curid=614483" title="Curtis D. Wilbur">
<text>Curtis Dwight Wilbur (May 10, 1867 – September 8, 1954) was an American lawyer, California state judge, 43rd United States Secretary of the Navy and a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

==Early life and education==

Wilbur was born May 10, 1867, in Boonesboro, Iowa, to Dwight Locke Wilbur and Edna M. Lyman. His family moved to Jamestown, Dakota Territory (now North Dakota), where he graduated high school. In 1884, he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1888. Shortly after graduation, Wilbur resigned his commission, a common practice at the time, and moved to Riverside, California. He read law at night while teaching mathematics during the day, and was admitted to the California bar in 1890.

==Career==

Wilbur associated with the firm of Bruson, Wilson &amp; Lamme, and engaged in private practice for eight years in Los Angeles, California. He was active in Republican politics, and in 1898 was president of the Fourth Ward Republican club. In 1898, he served as Los Angeles County Deputy Assistant District Attorney in the office of John C. Donnell, and by 1899 he was the Chief Deputy under District Attorney James C. Rives.

In September 1902, the Republican Party nominated Wilbur for the post of judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court to the take the seat of Lucien Shaw, who was running for Supreme Court. Wilbur won the election and in November 1902 began to hear cases &quot;pro tempore&quot;. He was especially interested in promoting children&#x27;s welfare: on the Superior Court, he was presiding judge of the juvenile department; in 1906 he was a director of the Bethlehem Benevolent Board; in 1910, he was a founding director of the Juvenile Improvement Association; in 1912, he was president of the Social Purity League, which offered religious lectures to the public; in 1915, he helped organize the Boy Scouts in Los Angeles, and was named permanent chairman of the executive committee; and he served as president of the state Sunday School Association, organizing evangelical gatherings for young people.

It was during his time on the California Superior Court that he wrote and first published (in 1905) his popular children&#x27;s book &quot;The Bear Family at Home, and How the Circus Came to Visit Them&quot;.

He taught at the newly founded law school of the University of Southern California from about 1904 until 1917, while he sat on the Superior Court. Annually, he taught one course, extraordinary legal remedies.

In 1917, Governor William Stephens appointed Wilbur to the California Supreme Court, where he served as an associate justice from January 1, 1918. In September 1922, Wilbur defeated William P. Lawlor in the primary election, and in November was chosen as the 19th Chief Justice of California, holding the position from January 1923 to March 19, 1924. When Wilbur resigned, Governor Friend Richardson appointed Louis Wescott Myers to take the post of chief justice.

==Secretary of the Navy==

On March 19, 1924, Wilbur was sworn in as United States Secretary of the Navy. The first appointee of President Calvin Coolidge, Wilbur came into the position with a reputation as a man of high intellect and a character of &quot;unimpeachable integrity.&quot; However, one critic called Wilbur &quot;a good Sunday school teacher who wants to make the Navy safe for boys.&quot; In July 1925, he accompanied three battleships on a cruise of the Pacific coast, stopping in Marin County for a picnic of 600 midshipmen with a group of more than 100 society women on Mount Tamalpais. In August 1928, he again accompanied a fleet to San Francisco, California on its way to Pacific training exercises. By the end of his term, Wilbur had achieved success in enlarging and modernizing the fleet and established a naval air force, which would grow to become a potent component in the war with Japan during World War II.

==Federal judicial service==

On March 1, 1929, in the last hours of his presidency, President Coolidge nominated Wilbur to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. However, when the 70th Congress ended that week, the Senate had not acted on the nomination, so it expired. Wilbur was nominated by President Herbert Hoover on April 18, 1929, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 45 Stat. 1414. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 2, 1929, and received his commission the same day. He was a member of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (now the Judicial Conference of the United States) from 1931 to 1944. He assumed senior status on May 10, 1945. His service terminated on September 8, 1954, due to his death in Palo Alto, California.

==Legacy==

The guided missile destroyer USS &quot;Curtis Wilbur&quot; (DDG-54) is named for him.

==Personal life==

Wilbur was married twice. On November 9, 1893, Wilbur married Ella T. Chilson. She died on December 10, 1896. Next, on January 13, 1898, he remarried to Olive Doolittle. They lived in a grand home completed in 1904 on Frederick Knob in San Francisco. Following retirement, Wilbur spent time with his wife and their three surviving children: Edna, Paul C. and Lyman Dwight.

In the summer of 1933, one of Wilbur&#x27;s children, Dr. Leonard F. Wilbur (March 2, 1907, Los Angeles – March 24th 1940, China), travelled to China with his wife Jean B. Spaulding. He studied at the College of Chinese Studies in Beijing in 1933–1934, achieving relative proficiency in Chinese. From the autumn of 1934 he worked at the American Board Mission Hospital in Taigu in the province of Shanxi, becoming its superintendent in 1936. He died of a typhus fever on March 24, 1940, at the age of 33, shortly after having returned from a furlough he spent at the Stanford University School of Medicine, and after having been ill for two weeks. He was survived by his wife and a daughter named Ruth.

Wilbur&#x27;s brother, Ray Lyman Wilbur, was United States Secretary of the Interior under Herbert Hoover, and a president of Stanford University.

<text>Academic freedom is the right of a teacher to instruct and the right of a student to learn in an academic setting unhampered by outside interference. It may also include the right of academics to engage in social and political criticism.

Academic freedom is often premised on the conviction that freedom of inquiry by faculty members is essential to the mission of the academy as well as the principles of academia, and that scholars should have freedom to teach or communicate ideas or facts (including those that are inconvenient to external political groups or to authorities) without the fear of being repressed, losing their job or being imprisoned. While the core of academic freedom covers scholars acting in an academic capacity – as teachers or researchers expressing strictly scholarly viewpoints —, an expansive interpretation extends these occupational safeguards to scholars&#x27; speech on matters outside their professional expertise.

Academic tenure protects academic freedom by ensuring that teachers can be fired only for causes such as gross professional incompetence or behavior that evokes condemnation from the academic community itself.

Historically, academic freedom emerged tentatively, as academics in medieval and early modern Europe could face repression for acting in ways considered objectionable by religious authorities or by governments. Scholars tend to link the institutionalization of academic freedom to the rise of the modern research university and the Humboldtian model of higher education from the 19th century. By one estimate, academic freedom has substantially increased worldwide since the 1960s. Academic freedom is more likely in liberal democratic states, while it is more heavily constrained in authoritarian states, illiberal states, and states embroiled in military conflict.

==Definition==
A minimal definition of academic freedom is that a teacher has a right to instruct, and a student has a right to learn in an academic setting unhampered by outside interference. Other definitions include the right of teachers to engage in social and political criticism. 

A broader definition of academic freedom incorporates individual, extramural and institutional components. Under this broader definition, an academic has freedom of expression without government interference, but this freedom is circumscribed by academic expertise and position. Academic freedom of speech is therefore narrower than a general freedom of speech. For example, a non-academic has the freedom of speech to criticize the efficacy of vaccines, but only has &quot;academic freedom&quot; to do so if they possess the prerequisite academic qualifications to do so. Unlike public speech, academic speech is also subject to quality controls by academic peers, for example through peer review.

Universities UK has defined academic freedom as &quot;protecting the intellectual independence of academics to question and test received views and wisdom, and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions, without placing themselves in danger of losing their jobs or privileges&quot;, while the American Federation of Teachers has seen it as &quot;based on the idea that the free exchange of ideas on campus is essential to good education&quot;. Norwegian education sees it as a guarantee that research and teaching is &quot;intellectually and morally independent of all political and economic interests&quot;, leading to openness, free enquiry and debate.

==Historical background==
Historically, academic freedom emerged tentatively. In medieval Europe, academics who criticized church doctrine or acted in ways considered objectionable by the church could face repression. Similarly during the era when nation-states were emerging, academic could face sanction for acting contrary to the government.

=== 19th century ===
Academic freedom began to gain institutional footing with the emergence of the modern research university. The Humboldtian model of higher education from the 19th century enshrined the basic ideas of academic freedom and diffused them to other countries. Wilhelm von Humboldt was a philosopher and linguist who was given the authority to create a new university in Berlin in the early 19th century. He then founded a university that adhered to two principles of academic freedom: freedom of scientific inquiry and the unity between research and teaching. According to Humboldt, the fundamental proposition underlying the principles of academic freedom was to uphold the view that science is not something that has already been found but as knowledge that will never be fully discovered and, yet, needs to be searched for unceasingly. The university he founded later became a model and inspiration for modern colleges in Germany and universities in the West.

=== 20th century ===
The concept of academic freedom was also formulated in response to the encroachments of the totalitarian state on science and academia in general for the furtherance of its own goals. For instance, in the Soviet Union, scientific research was brought under strict political control in the 1930s. A number of research areas were declared &quot;bourgeois pseudoscience&quot; and forbidden, notably genetics (see &quot;Lysenkoism&quot;) and sociology. Marxist scientist John Desmond Bernal characterized this as part of the interdependence between &quot;applied science&quot; and &quot;pure science&quot;.

Michael Polanyi argued that a structure of liberty is essential for the advancement of science. In 1936, as a consequence of an invitation to give lectures for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the USSR, Polanyi met Bukharin, who told him that in socialist societies all scientific research is directed to accord with the needs of the latest five-year plan. Demands in Britain for centrally planned scientific research led Polanyi, together with John Baker, to found the Society for Freedom in Science. The society promoted a liberal conception of science as free enquiry against the instrumental view that science should exist primarily to serve the needs of society. In a series of articles, re-published in &quot;The Contempt of Freedom&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Logic of Liberty&quot; (1951), Polanyi claimed that co-operation among scientists is analogous to the way in which agents co-ordinate themselves within a free market. Just as consumers in a free market determine the value of products, science is a spontaneous order that arises as a consequence of open debate among specialists. Science can therefore only flourish when scientists have the liberty to pursue truth as an end in itself:
==Rationale==
Proponents of academic freedom believe that the freedom of inquiry by students and faculty members is essential to the mission of the academy. They argue that academic communities are repeatedly targeted for repression due to their ability to shape and control the flow of information. When scholars attempt to teach or communicate ideas or facts that are inconvenient to external political groups or to authorities, they may find themselves targeted for public vilification, job loss, imprisonment, or even death. For example, in North Africa, a professor of public health discovered that his country&#x27;s infant mortality rate was higher than government figures indicated. He lost his job and was imprisoned.

The fate of biology in the Soviet Union is cited by Jasper Becker as a reason why society has an interest in protecting academic freedom. Also there is important to make the distinction between science and pseudoscience, on the border of this lies the case of a Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko rejected Western science – then focused primarily on making advances in theoretical genetics, based on research with the fruit fly (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) – and proposed an approach to farming that was based on the collectivist principles of dialectical materialism. (Lysenko called this &quot;Michurinism&quot;, but it is more popularly known today as Lysenkoism.) Lysenko&#x27;s ideas appealed to the Soviet leadership, in part because of their value as propaganda, and he was ultimately made director of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Subsequently, Lysenko directed a purge of scientists who professed &quot;harmful ideas&quot;, resulting in the expulsion, imprisonment, or death of hundreds of Soviet scientists. Lysenko&#x27;s ideas were then implemented on collectivised farms in the Soviet Union and China. Famines that resulted partly from Lysenko&#x27;s influence are believed to have killed 30 million people in China alone.

Sociologist Ruth Pearce argued that the concept of academic freedom exists to protect scholarship from censure by state or religious authorities, and not to defend intolerance.

A large-scale empirical study, covering more than 157 countries over the 1900-2015 period, links academic freedom to the quality and quantity of patents filed in a given country. David Audretsch and colleagues estimate that academic freedom has declined over the last decade for the first time over their century-long observation period, resulting in at least 4% fewer patents filed. The study claims to be the first to link academic freedom to economic growth through an innovation channel.

== Academic Freedom Index ==

Janika Spannagel and Katrin Kinzelbach call the Academic Freedom Index the first comprehensive global index of Academic Freedom around the world, with retroactive ratings for countries going back to 1900 that are also updated yearly. The index estimate academic freedom using five categories:
* freedom to research and teach
* freedom of academic exchange and dissemination
* institutional autonomy
* campus integrity
* freedom of academic and cultural expression

As of 2023, Academic freedom overall around the world has been in retreat since 2013. Causes cited have included authoritarianism as well as political polarization and populism.

==Country-specific==

The concept of academic freedom as a right of faculty members is an established part of most legal systems. While in the United States the constitutional protection of academic freedom derives from the guarantee of free speech under the First Amendment, the constitutions of other countries (particularly in civil law systems) typically grant a separate right to free learning, teaching, and research.

=== China ===

Academic freedom has been severely limited in China. Academics have noted an incentive not to express &#x27;incorrect&#x27; opinions about issues sensitive to the Government of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). These efforts have been effective in causing academics to self-censor and shift academic discourse.

In December 2020, the Associated Press reported that China was controlling scientific research into the origins of COVID-19 under direct orders from CCP general secretary Xi Jinping. According to the report, an order by China&#x27;s State Council required all research to be approved by a task force under their management, saying scientific publication should be orchestrated like &quot;a game of chess&quot;, warning that those who publish without permission will be held accountable.

According to National Public Radio, from 2013 to 2017, at least 109 universities in China issued their first charters affirming the CCP leadership. In 2020, Shanghai&#x27;s Fudan University removed freedom of thought from its charter following the December 2019 revision of the school charter to emphasize loyalty to the CCP.

Hong Kong academia expressed concerns about the impact of the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law on academic freedom in Hong Kong.

In an August 2021 study, Jue Jiang from the University of London argued that academic freedom in China is impaired by the CCP&#x27;s system of student informants, who are recruited and encouraged to watch and inform on their professors on university campuses. 

===France===

Professors at public French universities and researchers in public research laboratories are expected, as are all civil servants, to behave in a neutral manner and to not favor any particular political or religious point of view during the course of their duties. However, the academic freedom of university professors is a fundamental principle recognized by the laws of the Republic, as defined by the Constitutional Council; furthermore, statute law declares about higher education that &quot;teachers-researchers (university professors and assistant professors), researchers and teachers are fully independent and enjoy full freedom of speech in the course of their research and teaching activities, provided they respect, following university traditions and the dispositions of this code, principles of tolerance and objectivity&quot;. The nomination and promotion of professors is largely done through a process of peer review rather than through normal administrative procedures.

Academic freedom in France is different compared to other countries in European Union (EU). According to Maassen et al. (2023) &quot;Recent discussions about academic freedom in France have, amongst other things, been focused on the government approach to so-called “Islamo-leftism&quot; in academia&quot;. &quot;French Academia&quot; has been accused of creating an &quot;Intellectual breeding ground for Islamic terrorism&quot;; this alleged relationship has become somewhat of a political issue in France. Purported movements of &quot;Islamo-Leftism&quot; were debated during 2022 presidential election. However, The National Centre for Scientific research (CNRS) has denied any presence of so-called &quot;Islamo-leftism&quot; in reality (p. 76). Maassen et al. (2023) also argues that &quot;The debates in France illustrate that over the last decades higher education and society in the EU Member States and elsewhere have developed a new relationship, where traditional borders and distinctions have become less prominent&quot; (pp. 76–77). According to Maassen et al. (2023) in 2020, an amendment particularly speaking about &quot;academic freedom raised concern amongst the academic community&quot;. The concerning amendment stated that &quot;Academic freedom is exercised with respect for the values of the republic&quot; without any further discussion of those values or the limitations of those values. Later, an &quot;approximate of 40 academic research networks, associations, unions, and interest groups, in addition to almost 100 academic journals&quot; signed an open letter to drop the amendment (p. 77). This shows the disagreement among the stakeholders of European Union (EU) about academic freedom and the reach of political parties to limit academic freedom.

Various threats to &quot;Academic Freedom in France&quot; identified by Beaud (2022) and mentioned by Maassen et al. (2023, pp. 77–78) in the European Union article are as follow. The first type of &quot;classical threat&quot; is due to the intervention of &quot;Political authorities&quot;, as most of the universities in France are &quot;Public universities&quot; and under political supervision. Beaud (2022, para.31) refers to the case of &quot;Ernest Renan and Louis-Napolean&quot; to show how the political parties in France have been the limiting factors of Academic Freedom in France for a long time now. The authority in power, Louis-Napolean, suspended Ernest Renan course from the &quot;College de France&quot; after his lecture where &quot;he presented the main theses of his book on &quot;The Life of Jesus&quot;, a “scientific&quot; biography of Jesus Christ&quot;. Following the suspension, Ernest Renan was also removed from the &quot;body of College de France&quot;, with an &quot;accusation&quot; of not &quot;abiding&quot; the rule of not to include any &quot;personal opinion&quot; against the &quot;fundamentals of the Christian Religion&quot;. The second one is due to the interference of &quot;civil services at national level (The Ministry of Higher Education)&quot;. Along with the &quot;classical threats&quot; mentioned above, Beaud (2022) also points out to the &quot;new threats&quot; of &quot;academic freedom&quot;.

“The first new threat according to Beaud (2022) identified by Maassen et al. (2023, p.78) is formed by the university administration (referred to as the ‘close administration’), formed by the academics in leadership positions, and the institutional bureaucracy. It is argued that French universities have experienced the emergence of a “subtle form of hierarchization&quot; mentioned by Maassen et al. (2023, p. 78) referring to (Legrand 2008, p. 2242). The latter is interpreted as a threat to the freedom of academics to follow their own research and teaching agenda&quot;. The other &quot;new threat&quot; would be &quot;Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP)&quot;. This lawsuit is made to &quot;silence the critics burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition&quot;. Increasing use of this lawsuit is endangering the &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and &quot;academic freedom&quot;. Another &quot;new threat according to Beaud (2022, para. 50)&quot; pointed out by Maassen et al. (2023, p. 78) would be regarding &quot;students and academic activist groups&quot;. According to this new threat, the teachers won&#x27;t be only fearing from the authorities higher to them in the hierarchy of control, but also need to fear from &quot;students&quot; and &quot;activist groups&quot;, as they would decide if something taught by the teacher is offensive or not. This relates to the case of &quot;Islamo-leftism&quot; as mentioned before.

Barylo (2021, para.9–10), states that, &quot;part of this problem is the historical disconnect between policies and research in France&quot; is the &quot;country’s lack of thinktank culture&quot;, which is blocking the flow of &quot;Academic expertise&quot; into the &quot;government policy&quot;. Other countries like &quot;US&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;UK&quot; may share those flaws with France but at least they have &quot;equality laws&quot; which allows people to express themselves and have an established &quot;government structure&quot; which takes those expressions under consideration. This lack of &quot;Academic Freedom in France&quot; is causing academic scholars to move out of France, just like what the author of this article did. &quot;I shudder to think where this may end, but it does at least reassure me that I made the right decision when I joined all those émigrés and left France for the UK&quot; says the author, Barylo (2022, para.11).

On October 16, 2020, a middle school history teacher in the Conflans-Sainte-Honorine area, Samuel Paty, was murdered by Abdoullakh Abouyezidovich Anzorov, an eighteen year old Russian Muslim refugee who had been living in France since he was six years old. Paty had created a lesson for his class to teach his students the freedom of expression, in which he used the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazines that showcased caricatures of Muhammad. This information was posted on Facebook through a video from a parent of a Muslim student that was in the class where this lesson took place. This video was posted onto Facebook nine days before the tragedy took place. It was then reposted by another Facebook user who was a self-proclaimed imam that was known for having extreme Islamist views. This Facebook user also attached Paty&#x27;s personal cell phone number and the address of the school he worked at to the post.

Because of this extreme act of terror, French president Emmanuel Macron decided to stand firm on his stances against Muslim extremism while also wanting to uphold France&#x27;s values on freedom of expression. Macron and members of his party that are in the French Parliament decided to propose three bills that would drastically change the atmosphere of French society and education for the good of freedom of expression.

The first bill would criminalize on-campus gatherings that trouble the good order of the establishment; the punishment for violating this would be a $45,000 fine and/or 3 years in prison. The second bill was a global-security bill that aimed to aid law enforcement in situations similar to the Paty murders. However, a multitude of the details/provisions of this bill made French citizens upset. One of these provisions is that this bill would criminalize the publication/sharing of photos of police officers unless their identifying features have been blurred. This bill also stated that law enforcement will now be able to use drones to film citizens in public, along with allowing body-camera footage from police officers to be live streamed in real time to French authorities. Lastly, this bill would also harshen sentences for people that are charged with assaulting a police officer.

The third bill&#x27;s goal was to strengthen respect for the principles of the Republic by means of tweaking the education system in a multitude of ways. The French Government described this bill as a part of President Macron&#x27;s strategy to counter radical Islamists attempts to influence French society in a negative way. It would assign every French child with a tracking number to enforce the attendance of each child in government-recognized schools. This would effectively end most homeschooling practices and privately religious owned schools in France, which means that French parents now cannot guide their child&#x27;s education path to best suit their needs. Elective home education would be subjected to an issuance of authorization by the State, and it would only be approved if the child&#x27;s specific situation was defined by law. This would also give the French government control over the quality and quantity of education that a French child gets, while also ensuring that all French children are educated in the values of the French Republic. The bill would also criminalize sharing identifying information about a public servant that could be used to inflict harm along with &quot;intimidating/threatening violence upon a public official from motives drawn from convictions or beliefs.&quot;

Shortly after the murders, Macron also began to push for another proposed anti-extremist bill that would force imams to train in France while cracking down on the various groups that spread extremist and separatist ideals. This bill would also increase public funding for Islamic studies along with providing funds for low-income housing in the banlieues around Paris, which has been an area notorious for violence.

===Germany===

The German Constitution () specifically grants academic freedom: &quot;Art and science, research and teaching are free. Freedom of teaching does not absolve from loyalty to the constitution&quot; (Art. 5, para. 3). In a tradition reaching back to the 19th century, jurisdiction has understood this right as one to teach (&#x27;), study (&#x27;), and conduct research (&#x27;) freely, although the last concept has sometimes been taken as a cover term for the first two. &#x27; embraces the right of professors to determine the content of their lectures and to publish the results of their research without prior approval.

Since professors through their &quot;Habilitation&quot; receive the right to teach () in a particular academic field, academic freedom is deemed to cover at least the entirety of this field. &#x27; means a student&#x27;s right to determine an individual course of study. Finally, &#x27; permits academic self-governance and grants the university control of its internal affairs.
=== Ireland ===
Protections for academic freedom for research, teaching and other activity &quot;to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions&quot; without being disadvantaged, are provided in Section 14 of the 1997 Universities Act. 

=== Israel ===
Academic freedom in Israel is taken from &quot;the Law of the Council for Higher Education&quot;. Paragraph 15 in which it states that &quot;a recognized institution is free to all its academic and administrative matters, within the framework of its budget, as it sees fit. In this paragraph, &#x27;academic and administrative matters&#x27; – includes: determining a research and teaching program, appointing the authorities of the institution, appointing teachers and promoting them, determining a teaching method and study, and any other scientific, educational or economic activity&quot;. It seems that the paragraph is worded in a clear and comprehensible way even for laymen. The body that is supposed to guard academic freedom, as well as maintain an adequate academic level in the higher education institutions, is the Council for Higher Education – hereinafter &quot;The Council&quot;. This council consists of academics who serve as professors at universities, and public figures, with the Minister of Education as the head of the council.

At the disposal of &quot;The Council&quot; is an executive body called the &quot;Committee for Planning and Budgeting&quot;, which mainly deals with the matter of universities budgeting and establishing relevant procedures and guidelines for budget and salary matters. Another body that is supposed to guard academic freedom is the &quot;Committee of the Heads of the Universities&quot;, which is a voluntary body, but has an influence on the work of the Legislature and &quot;The Council &quot;. Through their employee committees, and through the personal activity of each of them, these bodies can try and influence the preservation of academic freedom.

In general, it can be said that the essential academic freedom, the one aimed at the freedom of teaching and research, was preserved, and the government neither interfered nor tried to interfere in these contents. Its way of influencing this matter is by providing incentives for teaching in this or that way, or for research in certain fields, and this is through grants. The fact that the government finances a significant percentage of the current budget of the universities (around 70% or more), also allows the government to decide what will be the tuition fee for a student at the budgeted universities in Israel. But, In 2021, an academic committee of the prestigious Israel Prize decided to award the Israel Prize in the field of mathematics and computer science to Professor Oded Goldreich from the Weizmann Institute of Science. The Minister of Education did not accept the committee&#x27;s recommendation on the grounds that Goldreich signed a petition calling for an academic boycott of Ariel University, which is located in the territories of Judea and Samaria, which are occupied territory, as well as for appealing to the German government to revoke its decision that the BDS movement is an anti-Semitic movement. The award committee appealed to the Supreme Court for a violation of its academic freedom, and the court overturned the decision, and ordered the Minister of Education to award Goldreich the award. Godreich received the award a year later.

In recent years, a fierce debate has erupted on the issue of academic freedom, following extreme political statements by a number of university faculty members. The vast majority of the controversial statements were those that called for an academic boycott of Israel, or support for organizations that support an economic and academic boycott of Israel. The question that was at the center of the storm was whether an academic faculty member (hereafter referred to as a professor) is protected by the principle of freedom of speech, or is it forbidden, when he wears the guise of a professor, to express a political position that might identify the position with the institution he allegedly represents. All the more, is it permissible for the professor to express a political position during his teaching, and even to invite representatives of political bodies to lecture in his classes, and without maintaining a balance between those invited. Referring to that background, the Minister of Education at the time Naftali Bennett (in 2017) asked Prof. Asa Kasher to compile an academic Code of Ethics for universities, a code that was approved by &quot;The Council&quot; in March 2018. All the research universities (7 universities), with the exception of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, which already had for an academic code of ethics that also included the issue of freedom of expression, refused to adopt this code on the grounds of infringing academic freedom.

All research universities in Israel have a Chief internal auditor, relatively independent. This issue of the interrelationship between the internal audit in universities and the principle of academic freedom is discussed in detail in an article that appeared in a book issued on behalf of the Ben-Gurion university of the Negev – the only one as mentioned that has a binding academic code of ethics.

=== Mauritius ===
In the Chapter II Constitution of Mauritius, academics have the right to: the protection of Freedom of Conscience, Protection of Freedom of Expression, Protection of Freedom of Assembly and Association, Protection of Freedom to Establish schools and the Protection from Discrimination. The institutional bureaucracy and the dependence on the state for funds has restricted the freedom of academics to criticize government policy. Dr. Kasenally, an educator at the University of Mauritius stated that in 1970s to 1980s the university was at the forefront of controversial debates, but in the 1990s the university stepped away after academic freedom was curtailed to not express views or ideas especially if they oppose those of the management or government.

In a 2012 paper on the University of Mauritius the author states that although there are no records of abuse of human rights or freedom of the state &quot;subtle threats to freedom of expression do exist, especially with regard to criticisms of ruling political parties and their leaders as well as religious groups.&quot; While there have been no cases of arrests or extreme detention of academics, there has been fear that it would hinder their career progress especially at the level of a promotion thus, the academics try to avoid participating in controversial debates. Academic freedom became a public issue in May 2009 when the University of Mauritius spoke out against the previous vice chancellor Professor I. Fagoonee, who had forwarded a circular sent by the Ministry of Education to academics. This circular targeted public officers and required them to consult their superiors before speaking to the press. The pushback resulted in the vice chancellor stepping down, with the author speculating the government used her as the scapegoat for its unpopular proposal to more overtly curtain academic freedom.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands the academic freedom is limited. In November 1985 the Dutch Ministry of Education published a policy paper titled &quot;Higher Education: Autonomy and Quality&quot;. This paper had a proposal that steered away from traditional education and informed that the future of higher education sector should not be regulated by the central government. In 1992 the Law of Higher Education and Research (Wet op het hoger onderwijs en wetenschappelijk onderzoek, article 1.6) was published and became effective in 1993. However, this law governs only certain institutions. Furthermore, the above provision is part of an ordinary statute and lacks constitutional status, so it can be changed anytime by a simple majority in Parliament.

===New Zealand===
The Education Act 1989 (s161(2)) defines Academic freedom as: a) The freedom of academic staff and students, within the law, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions; b) The freedom of academic staff and students to engage in research; c) The freedom of the university and its staff to regulate the subject matter of courses taught at the university; d) The freedom of the university and its staff to teach and assess students in the manner they consider best promotes learning; and e) The freedom of the university through its council and vice-chancellor to appoint its own staff.

===Philippines===

The 1987 Philippine Constitution states that, &quot;Academic Freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning.&quot; Philippine jurisprudence and courts of law, including the Philippine Supreme Court tend to reflexively defer to the institutional autonomy of higher institutions of learning in determining academic decisions with respect to the outcomes of individual cases filed in the courts regarding the abuse of Academic Freedom by professors, despite the individual merits or demerits of any cases. A closely watched case was the controversial case of University of the Philippines at Diliman Sociology Professor Sarah Raymundo who was not granted tenure due to an appeal by the minority dissenting vote within the faculty of the Sociology Department. This decision was sustained upon appeal by the dissenting faculty and Professor Raymundo to the University of the Philippines at Diliman Chancellor Sergio S. Cao; and though the case was elevated to University of the Philippines System President Emerlinda R. Roman, Roman denied the appeal which was elevated by Professor Raymundo to the university&#x27;s board of regents for decision and the BOR granted her request for tenure. A major bone of contention among the supporters of Professor Raymundo was not to question the institutional Academic Freedom of the department in not granting her tenure, but in asking for transparency in how the Academic Freedom of the department was exercised, in keeping with traditions within the University of the Philippines in providing a basis that may be subject to peer review, for Academic decisions made under the mantle of Academic Freedom.

===South Africa===
The South African Constitution of 1996 offers protection of academic freedom and the freedom of scholarly research. Academic freedom became a main principle for higher education by 1997. Three main threats are believed to jeopardize academic freedom: government regulations, excessive influence of private sector sponsor on a university, and limitations of freedom of speech in universities.

There have been an abundance of scandals over the restricted academic freedom at a number of universities in South Africa. The University of KwaZulu-Natal received fame over its restricted academic freedom and the scandal that occurred in 2007. In this scandal a sociology lecturer, Fazel Khan was fired in April 2007 for &quot;bringing the university into disrepute&quot; after he released information to the news media. According to Khan he had been airbrushed from a photograph in a campus publication because of his participation in a staff strike last February. In light of this scandal the South African Council on Higher Education released a report stating that the state is influencing academic freedom. In particular, public universities are more susceptible to political pressure because they receive funds from the public.

===United Kingdom===

The Robbins Report on Higher Education, commissioned by the British government and published in 1963, devoted a full chapter, Chapter XVI, to Academic freedom and its scope. This gives a detailed discussion of the importance attached both to freedom of individual academics and of the institution itself. In a world, both then and now, where illiberal governments are all too ready to attack freedom of expression, the Robbins committee saw the (then) statutory protection given to academic freedom as giving some protection for society as a whole from any temptation to mount such attacks.

When Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government sought to remove many of the statutory protections of academic freedom which Robbins had regarded as so important, she was partly frustrated by a hostile amendment to her bill in the House of Lords. This incorporated into what became the 1988 Education Reform Act, the legal right of academics in the UK &#x27;to question and test received wisdom and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions without placing themselves in jeopardy of losing their jobs or the privileges they may have&#x27;. These principles of academic freedom are thus articulated in the statutes of most UK universities. Professor Kathleen Stock formerly of University of Sussex resigned from her role due to controversy from students and the media regarding her transphobic views. In response to such concerns, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has issued guidance. The Guidance provides detailed procedures for universities to consider in determining whether or not specific events can go ahead. It also provides ways to reduce any potential barriers for freedom of speech in regards to specific events. The guidance also makes clear the statutory requirement of universities to ensure they protect freedom of speech on campus however as well as compliance with the Prevent Strategy and the Equality Act 2010. In 2016 the Warden of Wadham College Oxford, a lawyer previously Director of Public Prosecutions, pointed out that the Conservative government&#x27;s anti-terrorism &quot;Prevent&quot; strategy legislation has placed on universities &#x27;a specific enforceable duty ... to prevent the expression of views that are otherwise entirely compatible with the criminal law&#x27;.

===United States===

In the United States, academic freedom is generally taken as the notion of academic freedom defined by the &quot;1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot;, jointly authored by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the Association of American Colleges (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities). These principles state that &quot;Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject.&quot; The statement also permits institutions to impose &quot;limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims&quot;, so long as they are &quot;clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment&quot;. The principle also refers to the ability of teachers, students, and educational institutions to pursue knowledge without unreasonable political or government interference. The Principles have only the character of private pronouncements, not that of binding law.

Some accreditors work with American colleges and universities, including private and religious institutions, to support academic freedom in various forms, which vary by accreditor. Additionally, the AAUP, which is not an accrediting body, works with these same institutions. The AAUP does not always agree with the accrediting bodies on the standards of protection of academic freedom and tenure. The AAUP lists (censures) those colleges and universities which it has found, after its own investigations, to violate these principles. By 2022, 88 percent of four-year colleges and universities will limit student free speech, reversing a 15-year trend, according to the College Speech Codes annual report. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) reported that 426 out of 486 institutions have at least one policy restricting student speech.

Academic freedom started in America after the Civil War disrupted the previously stagnating systems of higher education. The educational system that Germany had was analyzed by universities to progress fields of research. Johns Hopkins University was the first to use this education system.

Prior to the turn of the twentieth century, a professor by the name of Edward Ross published the free silver movement supporting document known as &quot;Honest Dollars.&quot; The document placed the professor in political disagreement with the founders of Stanford University. The Stanford family made their money from the railroad industry that the professor had publicly ridiculed. In 1900, the professor expressed politically charged statements that called for the expulsion of Japanese immigrants from the country which would lead to his termination from the university. This decision was followed by seven other professors resigning from the university and elevated the matter to national scrutiny. This event would set in motion the creation of the AAUP to provide monetary and legal security, filling the gaps in many of their contracts.

In 1957, the U.S. Supreme Court began to take up the matter starting with the case of &quot;Sweezy v. New Hampshire&quot;. In &quot;Keyishian v. Board of Regents&quot; (1967), the Supreme Court made connections between the First Amendment and academic freedom as an especially important protection on the grounds that it was crucial to everyone. Such First Amendment protections only applied to public institutions, and academic freedom contains protections outside of the First Amendment as the Court never outright declared that it contained academic freedom.

==== For institutions ====
A prominent feature of the English university concept is the freedom to appoint faculty, set standards and admit students. This ideal may be better described as institutional autonomy and is distinct from whatever freedom is granted to students and faculty by the institution.

The Supreme Court of the United States said that academic freedom means a university can &quot;determine for itself on academic grounds:

# who may teach,
# what may be taught,
# how it should be taught, and
# who may be admitted to study.&quot;

In a 2008 case, a federal court in Virginia ruled that professors have no academic freedom; &quot;all&quot; academic freedom resides with the university or college. In that case, &quot;Stronach v. Virginia State University&quot;, a district court judge held &quot;that no constitutional right to academic freedom exists that would prohibit senior (university) officials from changing a grade given by (a professor) to one of his students.&quot; The court relied on mandatory precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Sweezy v. New Hampshire&quot; and a case from the fourth circuit court of appeals. The &quot;Stronach&quot; court also relied on persuasive cases from several circuits of the courts of appeals, including the first, third, and seventh circuits. That court distinguished the situation when a university attempts to coerce a professor into changing a grade, which is clearly in violation of the First Amendment, from when university officials may, in their discretionary authority, change the grade upon appeal by a student. The &quot;Stronach&quot; case has gotten significant attention in the academic community as an important precedent.

==== Relationship to freedom of speech ====
Academic freedom and free speech rights are not coextensive, although this widely accepted view has been challenged by an &quot;institutionalist&quot; perspective on the First Amendment. Academic freedom involves more than speech rights; for example, it includes the right to determine what is taught in the classroom. The AAUP gives teachers a set of guidelines to follow when their ideas are considered threatening to religious, political, or social agendas. When teachers speak or write in public, whether via social media or in academic journals, they are able to articulate their own opinions without the fear from institutional restriction or punishment, but they are encouraged to show restraint and clearly specify that they are not speaking for their institution. In practice, academic freedom is protected by institutional rules and regulations, letters of appointment, faculty handbooks, collective bargaining agreements, and academic custom.

In the U.S., the freedom of speech is guaranteed by the First Amendment, which states that &quot;Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...&quot; By extension, the First Amendment applies to all governmental institutions, including public universities. The U.S. Supreme Court has historically held that academic freedom is a First Amendment right at &quot;public&quot; institutions. However, the United States&#x27; First Amendment has generally been held to not apply to &quot;private&quot; institutions, including religious institutions. These private institutions may honor freedom of speech and academic freedom at their discretion.

==== Controversies ====

===== Evolution debate =====
Academic freedom is also associated with a movement to introduce intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution in US public schools. Supporters claim that academic institutions need to fairly represent all possible explanations for the observed biodiversity on Earth, rather than implying no alternatives to evolutionary theory exist, although in practice are interested in possible explanations from only one of the world&#x27;s religious traditions, the Abrahamic religions.

Critics of the movement claim intelligent design is religiously motivated pseudoscience and cannot be allowed into the curriculum of US public schools due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, often citing &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; as legal precedent. They also reject the allegations of discrimination against proponents of intelligent design, of which investigation showed no evidence.

A number of &quot;academic freedom bills&quot; have been introduced in state legislatures in the United States between 2004 and 2008. The bills were based largely upon language drafted by the Discovery Institute, the hub of the Intelligent Design movement, and derive from language originally drafted for the Santorum Amendment in the United States Senate. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the common goal of these bills is to expose more students to articles and videos that undercut evolution, most of which are produced by advocates of intelligent design or biblical creationism. The American Association of University Professors has reaffirmed its opposition to these bills, including any portrayal of creationism as a scientifically credible alternative and any misrepresentation of evolution as scientifically controversial. , only the Louisiana bill has been successfully passed into law.

===== ALFP debate (2014) =====

In 1940, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) provided a fundamental definition of the principles of academic freedom outlining the following: professors have the privilege to search for truth and knowledge and the right to impart those truths and knowledge to others, including students, the academy, and the general public, unfettered by political or ideological pressure.

Since being drafted, this definition has undergone two revisions in 1970 and 1999 respectively. The 1970 revision declares that the protections of academic freedom &quot;apply not only to the full-time probationary and the tenured teacher, but also to all others, such as part-time faculty and teaching assistants, who exercise teaching responsibilities&quot;. The 1999 revision places emphasis on the idea that post-tenure review should be conducted in a manner that respects academic freedom and due process.

In 2014, a debate was held by the Academic Leadership Fellows Program (ALFP), addressing the potential need to either further revise the text, overhaul it completely, or leave it as is. The argument that revision/overhaul is necessary asserts that due to rapid growth of technology in education, introduction of social media (which effectively blurs the line between existing as an academic and an individual with unique interests), increase in international students, and rise in student expectations for return on investment since 1999, the statement no longer applies to modernized academia and thus should be changed. The counterargument to revision/overhaul asserts that the AAUP&#x27;s statement has aged well, and that overhauling the standard that has existed for decades would only stir up further confusion. Instead, it is necessary to &quot;clearly articulate the statements&#x27; intended meaning through education, discussion, and by not supporting inappropriate behavior in the name of academic freedom&quot;. This debate took place in front of a live audience, who after hearing both arguments agreed overwhelmingly with keeping the statement as-is.

===== Communism =====
In the 20th century and particularly the 1950s during McCarthyism, there was much public date in print on Communism&#x27;s role in academic freedom, e.g., Sidney Hook&#x27;s &quot;Heresy, Yes–Conspiracy, No&quot; and Whittaker Chambers&#x27; &quot;Is Academic Freedom in Danger?&quot; among many other books and articles.

===== Diversity initiatives =====
Since 2014, Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier, and American Mathematical Society Vice President Abigail Thompson have contended that academics are asked to support diversity initiatives, and are discouraged from voicing opposition to equity and inclusion through self-censorship, as well as explicit promotion, hiring, and firing.

==== Controversial opinions ====
While some controversies of academic freedom are reflected in proposed laws that would affect large numbers of students through entire regions, many cases involve individual academics that express unpopular opinions or share politically unfavorable information. These individual cases may receive widespread attention and periodically test the limits of, and support for, academic freedom. Several of these specific cases are also the foundations for later legislation.

In 1929, Experimental Psychology professor Max Friedrich Meyer and sociology assistant professor Harmon O. DeGraff were dismissed from their positions at the University of Missouri for advising student Orval Hobart Mowrer regarding distribution of a questionnaire which inquired about attitudes towards partners&#x27; sexual tendencies, modern views of marriage, divorce, extramarital sexual relations, and cohabitation. The university was subsequently censured by the American Association of University Professors in an early case regarding academic freedom due a tenured professor.

In 2006, Lawrence Summers, while president of Harvard University, led a discussion that was intended to identify the reasons why fewer women chose to study science and mathematics at advanced levels. He suggested that the possibility of intrinsic gender differences in terms of talent for science and mathematics should be explored. He became the target of considerable public backlash. His critics were, in turn, accused of attempting to suppress academic freedom. Due to the adverse reception to his comments, he resigned after a five-year tenure. Another significant factor of his resignation was several votes of no-confidence placed by the deans of schools, notably multiple professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

In 2009 Thio Li-ann withdrew from an appointment at New York University School of Law after controversy erupted about some anti-gay remarks she had made, prompting a discussion of academic freedom within the law school. Subsequently, Li-ann was asked to step down from her position in the NYU Law School.

In 2009 the University of California at Santa Barbara accused William I. Robinson of antisemitism after he circulated an email to his class containing photographs and paragraphs of the Holocaust juxtaposed to those of the Gaza Strip. Robinson was fired from the university, but later the accusations were dropped after a worldwide campaign against the management of the university.

<text>Lot Myrick Morrill (May 3, 1813 – January 10, 1883) was an American politician who served as the 28th governor of Maine, as a United States senator, and as U.S. secretary of the treasury under President Ulysses S. Grant. An advocate for hard currency rather than paper money, Morrill was popularly received as treasury secretary by the American press and Wall Street. He was known for financial and political integrity, and was said to be focused on serving the public good rather than party interests. Morrill was President Grant&#x27;s fourth and last Secretary of the Treasury.

A native of Maine, Morrill received a public school education, briefly attended Waterville College, and became principal of a private school in New York. He then studied law and passed the bar in 1839, afterwards setting up law practices in Readfield and Augusta, Maine. Known for his eloquent speaking, Morrill was popular among Democratic friends advocating for temperance. Morrill was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1854 as a Democrat and served as chairman of the Maine Democratic Party. However, as the national divide over slavery grew during the 1850s, Morrill shifted his political allegiance to the Republican Party for the sole reason that Republicans opposed the expansion of slavery. He was elected as a Republican to the Maine Senate in 1856, followed by his election as governor of Maine in 1858.

As the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Morrill was elected to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Maine&#x27;s Hannibal Hamlin, who assumed the vice presidency under President Abraham Lincoln. Morrill&#x27;s Senate tenure lasted nearly 15 years, spanning from the start of the Civil War to the waning days of Reconstruction. While in the Senate, Morrill sponsored legislation that outlawed slavery in Washington, D.C., and advocated for education and suffrage for African American freedmen.

In 1876, President Grant appointed Morrill to serve as U.S. treasury secretary after Secretary Benjamin Bristow resigned from the position. When Morrill left the Senate to lead the Treasury Department, his political rival James G. Blaine was appointed by Maine&#x27;s governor to fill the then-vacant Senate seat. Morrill advocated strongly in support of the gold standard during his eight-month tenure as secretary. Upon his retirement from the Treasury Department in 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Morrill as collector of customs in Portland, Maine, a position he held until his death in 1883.

==Early life==
Lot Myrick Morrill was born on May 3, 1813, in Belgrade (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts) to Peaslee and Nancy (Macomber) Morrill. He was of entirely English ancestry, his earliest immigrant ancestor was Abraham Morrill, who came to America from England in 1632 as part of the Great Puritan migration. The Morrill family was very large; Lot having been one of 14 children. His older brother Anson P. Morrill was a prominent U.S. statesman. After attending common school, Morrill taught at a local academy to earn money to go to college. At the age of 18, Morrill attended Waterville College. After briefly attending Waterville, Morrill served as principal of a private western New York college for a year. Morrill returned to Maine and studied law under Justice Fuller in Readfield. Morrill passed the bar in 1839, and built up a successful law practice. At this time Morrill began to associate with the Democratic Party and was popular speaker among his Democratic friends.

==State political career==
Morrill entered politics as a speaker for early temperance movement in Maine and other political movements. In 1841, having become locally famous, Morrill moved to Augusta, Maine, where he spoke in front of Maine&#x27;s capital legislative committees. As a speaker, Morrill gained much experience in state politics. Morrill started a law practice in Augusta; his partners were James W. Bradbury and Richard D. Rice. In 1849, Morrill became chairman of Maine&#x27;s Democratic Party and served in this position until 1856. As a Democrat, Morrill was elected to Maine&#x27;s House of Representatives in 1854.

Morrill began to break from his party&#x27;s platform starting in 1855 eventually changing over to the Republican Party, having opposed Democratic concessions to slave states. During the 1856 presidential election, Morrill believed James Buchanan was a good candidate. However, he stated the Democratic Party&#x27;s platform was &quot;a flagrant outrage upon the country and an insult to the North&quot;. Morrill&#x27;s change of political views were shared by his brother, Anson Morrill, and his friend and future Vice President Hannibal Hamlin.

Morrill completely severed ties with the Democratic Party and formally became a Republican in 1856. As a member of the Republican Party, Morrill was elected a Maine state senator in 1856, serving as the Senate&#x27;s president. He was the first Republican to hold the position, which would be held by Republicans until 1964, with one brief exception. In 1858, Morrill was elected governor of Maine, a position his brother held a few years earlier. Morrill served as Maine&#x27;s governor until January 1861 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate to replace Hamlin, who had left his seat to become Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s running mate.

==U.S. Senator==

===Civil War===
Morrill came into the U.S. Senate at a pivotal moment in history before the American Civil War. In 1861, Sen. Morrill argued strongly against compromise on the principles of slavery (via constitutional amendments) in order to restore the peace. In February 1861, Morrill attended the Peace Conference of 1861 and opposed John J. Crittenden&#x27;s compromise arguments, similar to those made in the Crittenden Compromise. In March 1862, Morrill supported legislation that permitted the freedom of confiscated Confederate slaves captured during the War. Morrill believed this would be an effective military weapon against the Southern rebellion. In April 1862, Morrill spoke in favor of a bill that passed Congress; signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln that freed slaves in Washington, D.C. By the end of the war, he argued against punishing the southern states for the rebellion, and in favor of higher education for people of all races.

===Reconstruction===
During the Reconstruction era, Sen. Morrill forcefully advocated congressional Reconstruction that authorized the U.S. military in Southern sections of the United States to protect African American citizens.

On February 1, 1866, Morrill delivered a speech in Congress, which stated:
&quot;I admit that this species of legislation Civil Rights Act of 1866 is absolutely revolutionary. But are we not in the midst of a revolution? Is the Senator from Kentucky utterly oblivious to the grand results of four years of war? Are we not in the midst of a civil and political revolution which has changed the fundamental principles of our government in some respects? ... There was a civilization based on servitude... Where is that? ... Gone forever... We have revolutionized this Constitution of ours to that extent and every substantial change in the fundamental constitution of a country is a revolution.

In June 1866, Morrill supported suffrage for African Americans in Washington, D.C. In 1868, Morrill voted for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson; the other senator from Maine, William P. Fessenden, voted for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. In 1869, Morrill was defeated by his rival Hannibal Hamlin to the office of U.S. Senator from Maine by one vote. However, after Sen. Fessenden died in office in 1869, Morrill was appointed to replace Fessenden to serve out Fessenden&#x27;s expired term. Morrill was elected to finish the term in 1871 and served until he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury in 1876 by President Ulysses S. Grant.

===Committees===
In the Senate he was the first chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations. He was also chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (38th and 39th Congresses), U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia (39th Congress), the Committee on Appropriations (40th, 41st, 43rd and 44th Congresses) and the U.S. Senate Committee on the Library (41st and 42nd Congresses).

==Secretary of the Treasury==

Morrill was appointed Treasury Secretary by President Ulysses S. Grant; having served from 1876 to 1877 and for five days under President Rutherford B. Hayes. His appointment was in part due to the resignation of previous reformer Sec. Benjamin Bristow who successfully prosecuted and shut down the notorious Whiskey Ring scandal. Bristow resigned due to friction between himself and President Grant over Bristow&#x27;s zealous reforming in the Treasury Department and potential presidential run in 1876. Sec. Morrill, upon his assumption to office, was in charge of all the top secret and confidential files left over during Bristow&#x27;s Whiskey Ring prosecutions. Although Sec. Morrill did not have the reputation of a financial authority, he was believed to have political integrity and it was thought he would run the department as well as George S. Boutwell, Grant&#x27;s first Treasury Secretary. Morrill upon his appointment submission by President Grant was immediately approved by the Senate without question. Morrill&#x27;s appointment was popularly received by the press and Wall Street. Morrill&#x27;s resignation from the Senate caused a vacancy which Gov. Seldon Connor filled by appointing Morrill&#x27;s rival James G. Blaine as Maine&#x27;s senator.

===Currency redemption debate===
During Morrill&#x27;s tenure as Treasury Secretary, debate continued over the return to currency that could be redeemed for gold versus continuing to issue inflationary greenback paper currency. Like his predecessor Bristow, Morrill advocated for the gold standard, having viewed paper money as &quot;irredeemable and inconvertible&quot; and &quot;essentially repugnant to the principles of the Constitution&quot;. Paper money, however, was popular in the South and West, where cheap capital was seen as necessary for economic expansion. Since the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the Treasury Department to pay gold specie in exchange for greenbacks starting in 1879, Morrill advised Congress to increase the government&#x27;s gold supply leading up to that date.

==Later career==
Following his term in the Grant administration, he returned to Maine and became Collector of Customs for the Port of Portland, Maine.

Morrill died in 1883 in Augusta, Maine, leaving his wife Charlotte and four daughters. He was interred at Forest Grove Cemetery in that city. His Augusta home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Legacy==
The revenue cutter was named for him.

<text>Barleeiidae (often also spelled Barleeidae) is a family of small sea snails, micromollusks in the clade Littorinimorpha.

These snails are very abundant and live in sublittoral and intertidal waters on rocky substrates.

The shells are conical to high-spired. Their inner shell layer is chitinous. They are further characterized by a foot with sometimes a posterior mucous gland. Their olfactory organ, the osphradium is enlarged. In some species there are oesophageal pouches present. Their penis is sometimes provided with prostatic tissue. Their oviduct glands show a simple histology.

Few malacologists are currently working on micromollusks. Since they are so small (only a few millimeters in size), they are difficult to study and classify. Therefore, these small mollusks are less well known than the larger ones.

== Genera ==
Genera in the family Baleeiidae include:
*&quot;Ansola&quot; 
*&quot;Barleeia&quot; - Barleysnails 
*&quot;Caelatura&quot; 
*&quot;Fictonoba&quot; 
*&quot;Ketosia&quot; 
*&quot;Lirobarleeia&quot; 
*&quot;Protobarleeia&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudodiala&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidorissoia&quot;

<doc id="614488" wikidata="Q7757504" url="?curid=614488" title="The Pleasures of the Imagination">
<text>The Pleasures of the Imagination is a long didactic poem by Mark Akenside, first published in 1744.
== Contents ==
The first book defines the powers of imagination and discusses the various kinds of pleasure to be derived from the perception of beauty; the second distinguishes works of imagination from philosophy; the third describes the pleasure to be found in the study of man, the sources of ridicule, the operations of the mind, in producing works of imagination, and the influence of imagination on morals. The ideas were largely borrowed from Joseph Addison&#x27;s essays on the imagination in &quot;The Spectator&quot; and from Lord Shaftesbury. Edward Dowden complains that &quot;his tone is too high-pitched; his ideas are too much in the air; they do not nourish themselves in the common heart, the common life of man.&quot; Samuel Johnson praised the blank verse of the poems, but found fault with the long and complicated periods.
== Inspiration ==
Akenside got the idea for the poem during a visit to Morpeth in 1738.
== Similarly-named work ==
&quot;The Pleasures of the Imagination&quot; may also refer to &quot;The Spectator&quot; papers numbered 411 through 421, by Joseph Addison. These specific papers differed from the rest in that they were non-narrative and philosophical, and contained less obvious social commentary.

<doc id="614497" wikidata="Q3777663" url="?curid=614497" title="Royal Irish Academy of Music">
<text>The Royal Irish Academy of Music (RIAM) in Dublin, Ireland, is one of Europe&#x27;s oldest music conservatoires, specialising in classical music and the Irish harp. It is located in a Georgian building on Westland Row in Dublin. An institution which offers tuition from age 4 up to doctorate level, the RIAM has taught music performers and composers who have gone on to acclaim on the world stage. It is an associate college of the University of Dublin, Trinity College Dublin.

==History==
The RIAM was founded in 1848 by a group of music enthusiasts including John Stanford (father of Charles Villiers Stanford), Richard Michael Levey, and Joseph Robinson. It was originally located in the former Antient Concert Rooms on Pearse Street, then at 18 St Stephens Green, and moved to its present address in 36 Westland Row in 1871. The following year it was granted the right to use the title &quot;Royal&quot;. Its teaching staff includes many international and national prizewinners, members of the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and many individuals whose names have become synonymous with music education in Ireland.

The RIAM is a unique institution in the Irish context and doesn&#x27;t follow the typical European conservatoire model. Since its foundation, it has developed to become a place of relevance and inspiration for musicians, reaching to over 50,000 each year. In the course of its history, the RIAM has led the music education of over 1,000,000 musicians in Ireland.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, the RIAM cancelled its spring and summer examinations in line with the 12 March decision by the government to close schools and universities. In April, the RIAM announced that it was implementing an online system for exams. In response to social distancing measures, the RIAM also organised live stream performances and developed instructional content for its YouTube channel.

In September 2023, the RIAM opened its new concert hall, the Whyte Hall, a 300 seater venue which purports to be &quot;Dublin’s only purpose-built chamber music recital hall&quot;.

==Local Centre Examination System==

The RIAM&#x27;s Local Centre Examination System (LCES), founded in 1894, is Ireland&#x27;s only indigenous examining body for music. The LCES caters for 42,000 students in 1,700 centres in every county across the island of Ireland. Over 7,000 private music teachers enter their students for these exams, and the RIAM has developed a portfolio of teacher training programmes aimed at this market. November 2013 saw the launch of the RIAM Teaching Network, Ireland&#x27;s first virtual learning environment aimed at continuing education for the instrumental and vocal teacher. By utilising the skills of its core faculty to teach and advise the RIAM Teaching Network, the institution is committed to consolidating its position as &quot;the champion and enabler of the private music teaching profession&quot;.

==Part-time tuition==

The RIAM has 1,500 part-time students who are assessed annually and make up some of the pool of students who apply for RIAM&#x27;s full-time courses. Recent initiatives such as junior chamber music and junior improvisation courses have sought to offer such students (and outside students) the opportunity to develop a more rounded musical education. In 2016, the RIAM launched the &quot;Young Scholar Programme&quot; to support the development of the especially committed school-age children, through international exchanges, masterclasses and mentoring.

==Full-time study==

As an associate college of Trinity College, the University of Dublin, all RIAM degrees (at bachelor, master&#x27;s and doctorate level) are awarded by Trinity College, and students have access to the facilities of this institution. 150 full-time students study at the RIAM and also act as cultural ambassadors for the RIAM and for Ireland, forging good professional careers and participating in international concerts and competitions. This student body is made of representatives from over 17 countries. These full-time programmes are focused on classical music performance, composition and education, and have been running for a quarter of a century. Graduates of the RIAM&#x27;s full-time programmes have been accepted for further study at the most prestigious music institutions around the world from the Juilliard School in New York to the Royal Academy of Music in London. In recent years students of the Academy have been finalists and winners of some of the world&#x27;s most prestigious international competitions including the Clara Haskil International Piano Competition, the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, the China International Vocal Competition, the Cologne International Piano Competition, the Dublin International Piano Competition and the BBC Musician of the Year. On the international stage, former students are currently members of such leading orchestras as the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as opera houses from the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden to La Scala, Milan.

The Cathal Gannon Early Music Room was opened in May 2003; it contains a harpsichord and clavichord made by Cathal Gannon, a Broadwood grand piano restored by him, a square piano and information about Mr Gannon in addition to other historically significant keyboard instruments. In 2016, the RIAM founded Ireland&#x27;s first Historical Performance Department in collaboration with foundation partners, the Irish Baroque Orchestra.

==Philanthropy and financial aid==
At least 10% of the RIAM&#x27;s tuition income is reinvested in financial aid programmes for students. This allows young students from any socio-economic background to access a quality music education. At bachelor, master and doctorate level, tuition waivers are also made available, on the understanding that the scholarship recipients (known as &quot;1848 Scholars&quot;) will give back to the institution by assisting faculty or joining its outreach projects in Dublin city and beyond.

==Special collections==
The RIAM library holds a number of collections of historical interest, originally privately collected or belonging to orchestral and choral societies active in Dublin in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most notably, they include:

* The collections of the Sons of Handel and the Antient Concerts Society, who maintained a continuous choral tradition from 1790 to 1863 that was at the centre of musical life in Dublin.
* The collection of the Anacreontic Society (Ireland), an orchestral society active in Dublin from 1740 to 1865.
* The Hudleston Collection of solo and chamber music for guitar, collected by Josiah Andrew Hudleston (1799–1865) and which features around 1,100 works by Giuliani, Sor, Carulli and many others, in original and contemporary editions.

<text>Lawn cloth or lawn is a fine plain weave textile, made with fine combed cotton. Terms also used include batiste and nainsook. Originally the name applied to plain weave linen, and linen lawn is also called &quot;handkerchief linen&quot;. The term &quot;lawn&quot; is also used in the textile industry to refer to a type of starched crisp finish given to a cloth product. The finish can be applied to a variety of fine fabrics, prints or plain.

==Characteristics==
Lawn is a lightweight, sheer cloth, crisper than voile but not as crisp as organza. Lawn is known for its semi-transparency, which can range from gauzy or sheer to an almost opaque effect, known as lining or utility lawn. The finish used on lawn ranges from soft to semi-crisp to crisp, but the fabric is never completely stiff. Lawn can be white, or may be dyed or printed.

Lawn is designed using fine, high-thread-count yarns, which results in a silky, untextured feel. The fabric is made using either combed or carded yarns. When lawn is made using combed yarns, with a soft feel and slight luster, it is known as nainsook.

==History==
The term &quot;lawn&quot; derives from &quot;Laon&quot;, a city in France, which produced linen lawn. Cotton lawn rose in popularity due to its breathable characteristics in warmer climates particularly during the period of British rule in India and Pakistan.

==Uses==
Lawn cloth commonly is used for infant wear, handkerchiefs, dresses, blouses, aprons and curtains. Other uses are nightwear, underwear, lingerie, collar cuffs and shirting. It is also commonly used in vestments in Anglican churches, such as the surplice and episcopal rochet. 
Lawn is a very popular fabric in Pakistan, with new fabrics released from February each year. In 2016, lawn cotton was worth $500 million to the Pakistani textile industry and employs more than 30,000 people.

<text>Joe Louis Arena was an arena in Downtown Detroit. Completed in 1979 at a cost of US$57 million as a replacement for Olympia Stadium, it sat adjacent to Cobo Center on the bank of the Detroit River and was accessible by the Joe Louis Arena station on the Detroit People Mover. The venue was named after former heavyweight champion boxer Joe Louis, who grew up in Detroit.

It was the home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League and the second oldest NHL venue after Madison Square Garden until the start of the 2017–18 NHL season. Joe Louis Arena was owned by the city of Detroit, and operated by Olympia Entertainment, a subsidiary of team owner Ilitch Holdings.

In April 2017, the Red Wings hosted their final game at Joe Louis Arena; the venue was succeeded by Little Caesars Arena. The arena closed in July 2017. Demolition started in early 2019 and was completed by mid-2020. A 25-story residential tower called the Residences at Water Square opened at the site in February 2024.

==History==
The Red Wings had been playing at Olympia Stadium since 1927. However, by the late 1970s, the neighborhood around the Olympia had gradually deteriorated, especially after the 1967 Detroit riot. In 1977, the Red Wings announced that they would be moving to a proposed arena in suburban Pontiac. However, the city of Detroit countered with a proposal for a new riverfront arena in which they would charge the Red Wings much lower rent than what Pontiac was offering. The package also gave the team operational control of the arena, nearby Cobo Arena and parking lots. The Red Wings ultimately decided to stay in Detroit proper.

The arena hosted its first event on December 12, 1979: a college basketball game between the University of Michigan and the University of Detroit. The Red Wings played their first game at Joe Louis Arena on December 27, 1979, hosting the St. Louis Blues. The game ended in a 3–2 loss for the Red Wings. The Red Wings&#x27; first win at the arena came on December 30, 1979, where they defeated the New York Islanders 4–2. Later that season, it hosted the 32nd NHL All-Star Game on February 5, 1980, which was played before a then-NHL record crowd of 21,002. Joe Louis Arena was the site of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, which marked the first NHL Entry Draft to be held in the United States. In 1980, the arena hosted the Republican National Convention that nominated Ronald Reagan as the Republican candidate for President of the United States.
In 1990, color matrix boards were installed on the scoreboard; these were replaced by four Sony JumboTron video walls three years later, when the matrix boards were placed in the corners of the fascia. In 2006, LED video screens replaced the JumboTrons. The screens debuted November 22, 2006, when the Red Wings played the Vancouver Canucks. That same day, the arena&#x27;s West Entrance was named the &quot;Gordie Howe Entrance&quot; in honor of the legendary Red Wing player, and a bronze statue of Howe was placed inside the entrance. Joe Louis Arena housed 86 premium suites. In 2008, the arena introduced the Comerica Bank Legend&#x27;s Club, a 181-person private seating location in the arena&#x27;s southeast corner.

=== Replacement and demolition ===

On July 20, 2014, following the July 2013 approval of a $650 million project to build a new sports and entertainment district in Downtown Detroit, Christopher Ilitch unveiled designs for a new arena near Comerica Park and Ford Field which was completed in 2017 and succeeded Joe Louis Arena as the home of the Red Wings. On October 16, 2014, lawyers involved in the ongoing Detroit bankruptcy case disclosed in court that after demolition, which will be paid for by the city and state, the land on which the arena stands, along with an adjacent parking lot, will be transferred to the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a bond insurer with a $1 billion claim against the city.

The Red Wings&#x27; final game at Joe Louis Arena was played on April 9, 2017, against the New Jersey Devils. The final game at the arena also served as then Red Wings&#x27; captain Henrik Zetterberg&#x27;s 1,000th game. The Red Wings won 4–1, the final goal in the arena&#x27;s history coming from Red Wings forward Riley Sheahan. It was the second of two he scored, which were also the only goals he scored at all during the 2016–17 season. The last ticketed event held was a WWE Live event, held on July 29, 2017. Demolition of the interior of the arena started in early 2019, while demolition on the exterior commenced in June 2019. Due to the arena&#x27;s proximity to Cobo Center, now Huntington Place, it was dismantled traditionally rather than imploded.

== Other tenants and events ==

In 1995, the Detroit Junior Red Wings won the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Guelph Storm.

Joe Louis Arena hosted college hockey events as part of College Hockey at The Joe, the Great Lakes Invitational, and the Big Ten Conference hockey tournament in 2015 and 2017.

The Detroit Pistons used the arena for Game 5 of their 1984 playoff series against the New York Knicks when the Pontiac Silverdome was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict. In the game, Pistons star Isiah Thomas scored 16 points in the final 1:34 of regulation to send the game into overtime before the Pistons lost. The Pistons were forced to return to Joe Louis Arena for 15 games during the 1984–85 season, after the roof of the Silverdome collapsed during a snowstorm.

The Red Wings hosted the Stanley Cup Finals at the arena six times (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009). Two of their four Stanley Cup championships were clinched at Joe Louis Arena in 1997 and 2002. The Pittsburgh Penguins were the only visiting team to win the Stanley Cup at the Joe, taking home the trophy in 2009. It was also the only Game 7 of the Cup Finals played at the arena.

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the decisive Game 5 of the 2006 WNBA Finals between the Sacramento Monarchs and Detroit Shock on September 9, due to The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Shock&#x27;s usual home arena, being used for a Mariah Carey concert on the same day. The Shock won the game 80–75 to clinch the championship.

Former Arena Football League team the Detroit Drive also had success during their time at the arena, playing in six consecutive ArenaBowls from 1988 to 1993 and winning four of them. Four of the games (ArenaBowl III, ArenaBowl IV, ArenaBowl V and ArenaBowl VII) were played at Joe Louis Arena.

WWE hosted numerous shows at the arena, including the Survivor Series pay-per-view in 1991, 1999 and 2005.

Joe Louis Arena hosted the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, best known for the pre-competition attack on Nancy Kerrigan by associates of Tonya Harding. In addition, Joe Louis Arena was the site of the 2013 edition of the Skate America figure skating competition.

On May 7, 2015, it was announced that the Horizon League men&#x27;s basketball tournament would be held in Detroit beginning in 2016 under a five-year deal; the 2016 and 2017 tournaments were held at Joe Louis Arena.

On December 4, 2016, Joe Louis Arena hosted its final OHL game as the Windsor Spitfires defeated the Saginaw Spirit 3–2.

On February 10, 2017, Joe Louis Arena hosted its final regular season college hockey game as the Michigan Wolverines defeated the Michigan State Spartans 5–4 in a shootout.

Joe Louis Arena was also a concert venue. Until the Palace opened in 1988, Joe Louis Arena was Michigan&#x27;s largest indoor arena for concerts. The first concert to take place there occurred on February 17, 1980, in which Max Webster opened for the Canadian rock group Rush. This venue was used for the Alice Cooper concert film &quot;The Nightmare Returns&quot; in 1986. The last concert at the venue was Summer Jamz 20! on July 23, 2017.
== In popular culture ==
The arena is featured in the movie &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; in a scene depicting N.W.A&#x27;s performance of their controversial song &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;.

<text>Tibor Sekelj (14 February 1912 – 23 September 1988), also known as Székely Tibor according to Hungarian orthography, was a Hungarian born polyglot, explorer, author, and &#x27;citizen of the world.&#x27; In 1986 he was elected a member of the Academy of Esperanto and an honorary member of the World Esperanto Association. Among his novels, travel books and essays, his novella &quot;Kumeŭaŭa, la filo de la ĝangalo&quot; (&quot;Kumewawa, the son of the jungle&quot;), a children&#x27;s book about the life of Brazilian Indians, was translated into seventeen languages, and in 1987 it was voted best Children&#x27;s book in Japan. In 2011 the European Esperanto Union declared 2012 &quot;The Year of Tibor Sekelj&quot; to honor the 100th anniversary of his birth.

==Biography==

===Youth 1912–1939 ===
Sekelj&#x27;s father served as a veterinarian in the Austro-Hungarian Army and as a result the family moved around extensively. Several months after Tibor&#x27;s birth the family moved to Cenei (now in Romania), where Tibor lived until he was ten years old. While Hungarian was his &quot;mother tongue&quot;, the commonly spoken language was German. Sekelj had at least two sisters and a brother, Antonije, who later collaborated with him on several books. In 1922, the family settled in Kikinda, part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), where Tibor learned Serbo-Croatian. He also studied French and soon was teaching it to his fellow students. Sekelj went on to learn a new language every four years. In 1926 his family moved to Nikšić (now in Montenegro), where he took up gym, mountaineering and where he walked the entire length of Montenegro. In 1929 he entered the University of Zagreb (in Croatia) and in 1933 was one of the three youngest students to have graduated from the school of law. During that time Tibor also studied painting, sculpture, Esperanto, filmmaking and journalism. But the practice of law bored him, and he turned his attention to writing. He began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1937 he started to work in Zagreb as a film screenwriter. In 1982, in Leuven, Belgium, at the World Youth Esperanto Conference, he discussed his Sephardic Jewish ancestry with Neil Blonstein.

===World traveler===
Starting in 1939, Sekelj was a tireless globetrotter, and while he always returned to Serbia in between his many journeys, his need to explore new horizons melded with an insatiable curiosity about people. His travels and expeditions yielded books that have been translated into over twenty languages. 
=== South America 1939–1954 ===
In 1939 he left Zagreb for Argentina to write an article on Croat exiles for a Zagreb newspaper &quot;Hrvatski Dnevnik&quot;. Sekelj was on the ship Teresa on what might have been that ship&#x27;s last voyage due to the start of World War II. In 1939 the other ships that normally traveled to South America from Rijeka-Fiume were being used by Italy due to the war in Africa. Setting sail from Rijeka (then Fiume in Italy), he headed for Buenos Aires, with stops in Naples, Genoa (Italy) Santos (Brazil), and Montevideo (Uruguay). Tibor reached Buenos Aires on 19 August 1939. A pacifist by nature, Sekelj had anticipated the outbreak of war and so chose to be far from the fighting. This difficult decision was due not to a lack of personal courage—Sekelj was known to display almost foolhardy bravery throughout his life—but because this Jewish Hungarian/world citizen was simply unwilling to hew to any ideology tied to military purposes.

Within two years he had honed his knowledge of Spanish and got work as a journalist, publishing a monthly magazine dedicated to travel and exploration. Sekelj remained in Argentina for the next 15 years, writing and exploring South America.

==== 1939–1945: Argentina, Aconcagua ====
In 1944, with no prior mountaineering experience, Sekelj joined a crew on an ascent on Aconcagua, the highest mountain (m) in the South American continent., led by the Swiss German mountaineer Georg Link. Sekelj, the Austrian Zechner and the Italian Bertone reached the summit on 13 February 1944. But tragedy loomed: Four of the six men on that climb perished in a snowstorm. This terrible experience inspired Sekelj to write his first book: &quot;Storm Over Aconcagua&quot;, which recounts the drama in thrilling detail. On a second climb—initiated by the Argentinian Army, which Tibor led—the corpses of the four young men were found and brought home. As a result, Sekelj added a chapter to the second edition of &quot;Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua, 1944&quot; in which he describes that adventure. Then Argentine President Juan Perón personally tried to award Sekelj honorary Argentine Citizenship for his actions, along with the Golden Condor the country&#x27;s highest medal of honor. Tibor, in his gentle rejection of the offer of citizenship, stated that, while he deeply appreciated the offer, as a Citizen of the World, he could not be bound to any one country.

==== 1946–1947: Mato-Grosso ====
Based on the success of his first book, Sekelj&#x27;s publisher urged him to write a second, unrelated one. With a budget of two thousand dollars, Sekelj chose to explore uncharted regions of the Brazilian rainforests in Mato Grosso, otherwise known as the River of Death. In 1946 he undertook first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, which produced a popular book, &quot;Along Native Trails&quot; (Por Tierra De Indios). His partner on this arduous journey was an Argentinian of Russian descent Mary Reznik (1914–1996). Together they spent nearly a year exploring tribes along the Araguaia and Rio das Mortes Rivers. Along the way they survived contact with the fearsome Xavantes Indians, who had killed over a hundred people, in many expeditions before them. They also encountered the &quot;Karajá&quot; and &quot;Javae&quot; Indians on this expedition. Eventually the book &quot;Por Tierra de Indios&quot; (1946) chronicling survival in difficult circumstances, amid illness and near-starvation, met with great success, was reprinted repeatedly and translated into many languages. In 1946 Tibor and Mary married. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948. After that expedition he penned &quot;Where Civilization Ends&quot; (&quot;Donde La Civilizacion Termina&quot;).

In the summer of 1946, Tibor traveled through Patagonia with three companions : Zechner, Mary and Dr Rosa Scolnik. During the following years he audited classes at the University of Buenos Aires to attend lectures on anthropology, ethnology and archeology, in order to get useful knowledge for his upcoming expeditions.

==== 1948–1949: Bolivia, Jivaros ====
In 1948 a failed expedition to find the Jivaros led Tibor and Mary to Bolivia, where they met with President Enrique Hertzog. He encouraged them to explore the unknown area of the River Itenez, which abuts with Brazil. During that difficult six-month-long journey they encountered more hardships and hostile Indians, among them the Tupari, a tribe that only a few years before had been practicing cannibals. In April 1949, President Hertzog of Brazil proposed that Sekelj should oversee a territory spanning one hundred thousand hectares, from the planned 4 million hectares meant to house a million European refugees. Sekelj, rather than having to wait for six months for parliament to render a decision, turned down the offer. He later regretted the missed opportunity to have a place where Esperanto could become the common language to its populace.

==== 1949–1951 Venezuela ====
After attending the World Congress of Esperanto in UK, Tibor spent seven months in Europe. He returned to South America, joining Mary in Venezuela. For the next seventeen months he wrote newspaper articles, while managing a musical instruments store in Maracaibo. After going to Caracas to oversee the creation of a series of historical murals, he began traveling through Central America on his own, as by this time he and Mary and separated. The couple formally divorced in 1955, and soon after Mary went to the United States, where she remarried. Their son, originally named Diego after a son of Christopher Columbus, took her second husband&#x27;s surname. Daniel Reinaldo Bernstein is a respected acupuncturist and musician living in New York City.

==== 1951–1954: Central America ====
Tibor later wrote about being on the island of San Blas in Panama, where he engaged with the &quot;Kuna&quot; Indians; of an attempt to scale the volcano Izalko in El Salvador, that was cut short by a volcanic eruption; and of discovering the ruins of an ancient city in Honduras, which many people knew from legends only, and that was built by Indians. It was during these treks through Guatemala and Honduras that Sekelj became ever more immersed in archeology and anthropology.

Upon Sekelj&#x27;s arrival in Mexico in 1953, several alpine clubs invited him to take part in their treks. This was not unexpected, given the fact that his book &quot;« Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua »&quot; had practically become a manual for mountain climbing. He climbed Popocatépetl, Iztaccihuatl and many other volcanoes and mountains, further firming up his expertise in that arena. One of many fascinating explorations at that time was the underground crossing of the river San Heronimo, lying 14-km within the interior of mountain.

===Subsequent world trips based from Europe 1954–1988===
In 1954 Sekelj returned to his home in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He was given a warm welcome by the local government and its people, as much for his humanitarian message as for his fascinating travelogues. Along with his countless newspaper articles, his books were translated into Serbian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Albanian and Esperanto. He continued to travel and write of his experiences.

====1956–1957: India, China, Nepal====
In 1956 he drove through Asia as a World Esperanto Association (UEA) observer to an upcoming UNESCO talk held in New Delhi. When his car crashed in Tehran he continued on by bus and rail. During that journey he met extensively with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, future prime minister Indira Gandhi. He also befriended the future president Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. In the Yugoslav embassy he met with Ljubomir Vukotić, then president of the World Federation of the Deaf When Vukotić met with Indian and Chinese representatives to open an Asian office, Seklelj acted as interpreter, bridging a communication gap between non-hearing people of different languages. In January 1957, he accompanied Vukotić to China, which at the time was not accepting visitors. This was followed by a six-month stay on the invitation of King Mahendra of Nepal, another country that was, at that time, hostile to foreigners. King Mahendra personally thanked Sekelj for founding the first people&#x27;s university, and for helping to spread the teaching of Esperanto. This friendship is in part the subject of Tibor&#x27;s book, &quot;« Nepal opens the door », 1959,&quot; which he first wrote in Esperanto while in Madras studying yoga philosophy. The book was translated into multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Serbian and Slovenian. His journey through India, on foot and by bus, led Tibor from village to village, and from temple to temple, culminating in a month-long stay in a cave with three Yogin.

====1958–1960: Vinoba Bhave, Japan, Sri Lanka====
After spending six months in Europe Sekelj again flew to India, this time to teach Esperanto to the great Indian Mystic, Vinoba Bhave. The Hindu scholar mastered Esperanto within a month. Sekelj remained in India for five months before landing, penniless, in Japan. In March 1960, he set off on a four-month tour across 30 cities in Japan, always welcome at the home of Esperantists there. Between lecturing and writing newspaper articles, Sekelj earned enough money to buy an airplane ticket to Sri Lanka, and then to Israel before returning to his home base in Belgrade.

====1961–1963: Morocco, &quot;Caravan of Friendship&quot; in Africa====
In 1961, Sekelj accepted the invitation of Moroccan Esperantists and traveled to Morocco, where he joined a caravan of Tuaregs nomads into the Sahara. In March 1962, Tibor set off for Africa on a &quot;Karavano de Amikeco&quot; (Caravan of Friendship), with eight people from four countries in two all-terrain cars. With a goal of direct communication between people, this yearlong journey reached Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. When a second caravan meant for other African countries failed to materialize, Tibor climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. This trip is the theme of his book &quot;Ĝambo rafiki&quot;. Although he wrote the book in Esperanto, it first appeared in Slovene.

====1965–1966: Russia, Japan, Mongolia, Europe====
In 1965, on his way to the World Congress of Esperanto in Tokyo, Tibor traveled by train across Russia (Moscow) and Siberia (Irkutsk and Khabarovsk) to Nahodka, before landing in Yokohama by boat. A month later Tibor crossed Siberia by train, with a side trip to Mongolia. Given the antipathy to foreigners there, his three-month stay was difficult, despite having a stamped visa and correct documents. In ensuing years Tibor Sekelj managed to visit every European country, with the exception of Albania and Iceland.

====1970: Australia, New Zealand, New-Guinea====
In 1970, Yugoslav television sent Sekelj to Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. During his six-month stay he climbed Mount Kosciuszko In New Guinea he met with natives whose lack of previous contact with the civilized world led to tense situations. But among Sekelj&#x27;s many skills—and perhaps luck was just another one—was an uncanny ability to escape imminent danger time and again. Certainly he adapted easily to odd customs (including bizarre food), but if there was a single thing in particular that helped in this regard, it was his communication skills, which transcended even his facility with language.

====1972–1980: North America, Russia, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Ecuador====
In 1972, while at the international congress of ethnologists in Chicago Tibor visited eastern Canada and United States. In 1977, during the same event in Leningrad, he saw Uzbekistan and Central Asia. That same year he took part in a festival celebrating the culture of former slaves in Lagos (Nigeria). In 1978, during an assignment for Yugoslav TV, he returned to South America, where he visited Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands.

What amazed many was how this tireless traveler always got funding for his travels. He famously attributed this ability to the fact that he did the work of seven: Writer; cameraman; assistant; photographer; and buyer and shipper of ethnographic artifacts. While each of these jobs is usually delegated to others, Sekelj was a one-man crew. Of course, one could have added &#x27;Ad Man&#x27; to that list. Whenever it was possible, Tibor would wrangle advertising contracts from airlines in exchange for discounted tickets.

====Work for Esperanto====
Sekelj devoted much of his life to the defense and promotion of Esperanto. A Committee member of UEA since 1946, he sought for over thirty years—with a brief break while skirmishing with Ivo Lapenna) over its activity within the Instituto por Oficialigo de Esperanto (IOE), to be part of all the universal Esperanto Congresses. And as a representative of the IDU—the International Committee for Ethnographic Museums—he took part in numerous conferences. Sekelj&#x27;s polyglot abilities often assured that he alone could understand all of the multi-national speakers there.

In 1983, he co-founded EVA (Esperantist Writers Association and was its first president. In 1986 he was elected to be a member of the Academy of Esperanto.

He took every opportunity to advocate for Esperanto, particularly in the international Writers association PEN and at UNESCO. In 1985, during the 27th Conference in Sofia, Sekelj was commissioned by UEA to ensure that Unesco would draft a second resolution that would be favorable to Esperanto .

====1972–1988: Director of museum in Subotica====
In 1972, he took a four-year job as head curator of the Municipal Museum in Subotica (Serbia – Vojvodina). In the later 1970s he took advanced studies in museology in Zagreb University leading to a doctorate (in 1976). His innovative ideas and projects found little support, and Sekelj quit his job almost immediately. He attended the World Congress of ethnographers in Chicago in the United States and the World congress of museum professionals in Copenhagen. Upon his election to Secretary of the International Committee of Museologists, he took on various initiatives for new kinds of museums with dioramas.

In 1985, Sekelj met a young woman Erzsébet Sekelj, a librarian, born in 1958, whom he met on a journey through Hungary. That year she learned Esperanto. Sekelj and Erzsébet married in 1987 in Osijek. Together they visited three World Congresses of Esperanto. Erzsébet Sekelj participated in the drafting of the vojvodina organ VELO. They jointly wanted to compile an Esperanto-Serbo-Croatian dictionary, which was never completed due to the death of Tibor.

Tibor lived in Subotica from 1972 until his death, 20 September 1988. He is buried in &quot;Bajsko groblje&quot; (Baja cemetery) in Subotica, with the highest honors from the city of Subotica. On his grave, under bronze bas-relief one can read that inscription in Esperanto: (WRITER, TRAVELER)
== Skills ==
Tibor Sekelj was adroit at a wide range of skills: journalist, explorer, adventurer, mountaineer, writer, drawer, filmmaker, geographer, ethnologist, museologist, polyglot and actor on the political stage, relating to politicians including aforementioned heads of state. His defense and promotion of Esperanto at Unesco and mainly the UEA. The connecting thread in this man&#x27;s world view was a consistent access to peoples from around the world.

=== Geographer ===
Traveling certainly helped make him a geographer, but he also was forced to become a true cartographer during his travels. In that regard he researched and designed charts of several previously uncharted parts of South America, especially in Bolivia and Brazil. As a result, a river was named after him: Rio Tibor. He published word maps in Esperanto and edited a professional review &quot;«Geografia Revuo»&quot; between 1956 and 1964. In 1950 he became a member of Guatemala society about history and geography and, because of his merits in this area, in 1946 the Royal Geographical Society of United Kingdom accepted him as an &quot;FRGS&quot;.

=== Journalist ===
He learned about journalism during his student years in Zagreb, where he became a correspondent for Croatian newspapers : one from them, &quot;Hrvatski Dnevnik&quot;, sent him as his correspondent to Argentina, to do a report on Yugoslav emigrants, which is how he became a traveller. After two years he learned Spanish enough to self-publish, Buenos Aires, in Spanish, monthly organ &quot;« Rutas »&quot; (Ways) a magazine dedicated to geography, journeys, tourism, explorations, etc.

Working as a journalist for an Argentinian newspaper, he decided to join a planned expedition to Aconcagua, the highest mountain of Americas (more than 7000 m according to contemporary ratings). For the most part he was able to support himself through writing, contributing to many newspapers, mainly in South America and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia he contributed to many small newspapers, so that the younger generation learned about Esperanto through his articles in young people&#x27;s periodicals. In his 60s he became a television journalist, filming a series of TV-reports for the Belgrade Television about the Caravan of Friendship (travel through Africa) for the Zagreb Television about exploring unknown tribes in Australia and New Guinea and for the Novi Sad Television about Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. He was also a brilliant journalist for Esperanto. Except contribution to many Esperanto-newspapers and organs he was chief editor during 8 years for the Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto (initially IOE-Gazeto) of 1966–1972 (monthly organ – entirely appeared 65 editions) and VELO during six years (1983–1988 – Vojvodina Esperanto-newspaper).

&quot;Geografia Revuo&quot; appeared between 1956 until 1964, each one volume yearly, except in 1959–1960 neither in 1962. The title-pages of exclusively all six volumes are of Sekelj, only in the 4th issue he left the place of the editorial to Aafke Haverman &quot;(&quot;Aviadile tra Afriko&quot;)&quot; and laid his &quot;Kun la Ajnoj de Hokajdo&quot; in the central booklet. Looked at as entirety, &quot;Geografia Revuo&quot; is virtually personal periodical of Sekelj with some appendices of friends.

He lived chiefly on his work as a journalist (writing articles and stories for many various newspapers and organs) and filmmaker. There were 740 translations of his articles in newspapers and organs. We can say definitely that he was writing for many dozens of newspapers and magazines, mainly in Yugoslavia but also in Hungary, and various countries in South America—not to mention the periodicals in Esperanto. Of the 7500 speeches he gave, the majority centered around his journeys, although he spoke prolifically on many other topics as well.

He traveled through 90 countries and his books appeared in as many countries and a great many languages.

===Filmmaker===
Tibor&#x27;s first job after getting his Degree in Zagreb was with a film company, Merkurfilm. The company sent him to learn film production in Prague, where he studied under a famous Czech director Otakar Vávra where for 6 months Tibor studied film direction.

Once Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia in the 1960s, he began getting TV coverage as a journalist. And because his forays into unknown areas required more than just pictures—they required film—Tibor accepted the challenge. He began using his knowledge as a filmmaker, not only directing himself but also using sound and light, camera work and more on his trips to New Guinea and Australia. For Zagreb television he filmed a series of films about those regions and their natives that became a 10-hour-long travel film series seen across Yugoslavia. Amazingly, he did everything on those films alone. In the later part of the 1970s he made films about Colombia and Ecuador where he used a professional team of filmmakers from Novi Sad Television, which promoted his travel films.

He himself was the subject of many interviews, chiefly within former Yugoslav televisions. A large majority of that material has been preserved. One example is an in-depth, two-hour interview with TV journalist Hetrich.

=== Mountaineer ===
In Argentina he learned about mountaineering with barely enough time to prepare before taking part in an expedition to Aconcagua. Still he was able to survive the climb up that treacherous mountain. Later on, he climbed a number of very dangerous mountains, and on all the continents, between the mountains of Nepal, Mexico and Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. His detailed description of the ascent on Aconcagua in a book in Spanish became a sort of textbook for mountaineering in Mexico, and other countries across South America.

=== Ethnologist ===
During his travels he became a collector of native masks, hats and musical instruments, along with spoken native poetry. Concerning the latter he published the book &quot;Elpafu la sagon&quot;, that appeared in Serbocroatian and Esperanto. He donated his tangible collection of masks, instruments and hats to Ethnographic museum in Zagreb and to Municipal museum of Subotica, where most of them were later given to the museum of Senta (Serbia).

=== Adventurer ===
Although his goal was never to impress others, the most attractive aspect of Tibor Sekelj&#x27;s life in the eyes of the public—especially to the non-esperantist—was unarguably his adventurer side. Perhaps it was his ceaseless search to locate the essence of human spirit that led him to remote parts of the earth. Across a span of over forty years he studied, and engaged with, tribes from the rain forests of Brazil and New Guinea, always learning and annotating the customs, lifestyles and philosophies of then unknown peoples in Asia and Africa. Many times he befriended people otherwise hostile to the white man, and often risking his life in the process. He writes eruditely about this in his book in Esperanto &quot;&quot;Mondo de travivaĵoj&quot; (The world of experiences ), 1981.&quot;

=== Political militant ===
Among Sekelj&#x27;s many skills was an ability to create an instant sense of ease between himself and politicians and men in power. Score of heads of state welcomed him into their circle, and in turn he gave them useful advice based on his travels through their territories. During his life he met with various heads of State : From Juan Perón (Argentinian president) he received in 1946 an award, the Golden Condor, along with an offer of Argentinian citizenship due to his bravery on Aconcagua. He met with, and became a friend of, Jawaharlal Nehru (Indian prime minister) and his daughter Indira Gandhi (future Indian prime minister), and with Radhakrishnan (future Indian president). Bolivia president Enrique Hertzog sent him to do research in uncharted regions of Bolivia in 1948, and in 1949 asked him to manage Bolivian territory for European refugees after World War II, offering 100.000 hectares for him to do that. Tibor asked for 4 million, but was told it would take half year for the Bolivian parliament to ratify that. He chose not to wait and left before ratification could take place. Also he met with King Mahendra of Nepal, who thanked Tibor Sekelj for creating the first people&#x27;s university there, where he taught Esperanto.

The peak of his political activity was in 1985 when he took over the UEA in order to prepare the second resolution of UNESCO on Esperanto. He met with numerous heads of state, ministers and diplomats during his four participations in UNESCO-talks throughout 1984 and 1985. He finally succeeded in convincing the Yugoslavian government to offer that resolution to the Assembly of UNESCO in Sofia, while getting other Esperantists to work on the governments of China, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, San Marino and Costa Rica in order to back the resolution. Over the next months he visited the embassies of seven of those countries, finally succeeding in convincing them that they should work with their governments and accept the resolution. In Sofia he negotiated between the delegations of numerous countries to vote on the resolution, which in the end was accepted.

To all of this we can also add the few months he spent living with the Indian philosopher and political activist Vinoba Bhave, not to mention many, many heads of smaller regions and cities and states across the world.

===Polyglot===
Sekelj learned 25 languages and countless dialects, of which he retained nine at the end of his life: Hungarian, Serbian, German, Esperanto, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese. Of these he wrote extensively in Spanish, Esperanto and the Serbo-Croatian, He was an interpreter on his travels and as part of his work for PIF during acceptances, arrangements etc.

===Esperantist===
After becoming an Esperantist in Zagreb in 1930, Sekelj remained committed to the ideals of the international language throughout his life. His contributions to the language are immense: Sekelj founded ten Esperanto-Associations in South America and Asia and Esperanto-societies in 50 of cities across the world.

For over twenty years Sekelj was a committee member of UEA and he was single-handedly responsible for the second resolution where UNESCO positively addressed Esperanto in 1985. One-third of his books were originally written in Esperanto. He wrote a great many lucid and cogent articles for various Esperanto-newspapers and magazines, and he drafted &quot;Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto &quot;and&quot; Velo.&quot; But his intense activity in the name of Esperanto related to his foundation and guide of International Institute for Officialization of Esperanto (IOE) that launched the motto « better practice than 100-hours sermon » like this requiring more open activity of Esperantists. In that sense he especially engaged in diverse travel, organizing bus caravans that traveled across the world, having its greatest impact at the start of the International Puppet Theatre Festival (PIF) in Zagreb and later at the foundation for &quot;Internacia Kultura Servo&quot; (International Cultural Service). PIF still exists, currently after 44 years and still distributes an annual prize &quot;Tibor Sekelj&quot; for the most humanitarian message. His very intensive activity in the name of IOE had a strong effect on the classical neutral Esperanto-movement in the practical application, on the one hand in terms of culture and tourism and on the other to a more elastic conception of impartiality that followed TEJO.

His motto for success: &quot;Three things are essential for success: precisely define your goal, move steadily toward it, and persist until you have reached it.&quot;

====Teacher====
He influenced the teaching of Esperanto, and was behind the launching of the first televised course in Esperanto in China. In the 1980s, he wrote textbooks. The authors were A. and T. Sekelj and Klas Aleksandar and Novak Koloman did the illustrations. The course existed also in form of transparencies – actually movies – one can project.
He led many Master Esperanto classes wherever he travelled and also took part in the improvement of the «Zagreb method» textbook. Tibor Sekelj gave between 7000 and 8000 speeches, most often with photos of his travels, wrote innumerable articles about Esperanto in the national press and was interviewed hundreds of times for national radios, newspapers and television. He always spoke about Esperanto.

===World view===
Wherever he was, in his lectures and activities he conveyed to his audience his simple philosophy of life: man as an individual is the most precious thing in his own environment, regardless of descent or education. (This is most clearly expressed in his work &quot;Kumeŭaŭa&quot;.) Man as a cultural capital is the product of all humanity, because in our daily lives we interact with products invented by diverse people; he illustrated this with a dining table, explaining that each piece of tableware was invented by a different people, each of the foods that had been developed and planted by different people, and now ten cultures are involved in setting a table. Therefore, every man was a respectable person, and what we have today is the result of efforts of all nations, and therefore belongs to all.

=== Artist ===
Aside from being an adept writer, Sekelj studied painting and sculptor while still a student in Zagreb. When he first landed in Argentina, he survived doing portraits and later he often illustrated his own books.

==== Writer ====
Tibor is perhaps the most well-known original Esperanto-writers among the non-esperantist world, given the number of his translated books from Esperanto. The most successful his work &quot;Kumewawa – the son of jungle&quot; has been translated multiple times, while others books have between two and ten translations. Writing in Esperanto, Spanish and Serbo-Croatian he produced some thirty works of travel writing, novels, stories and poetry.

The most successful of his books is « Kumewawa – the son of jungle » (originally written in Esperanto) translated into 22 languages. In 1983 the Japanese ministry for education proclaimed in 1983 as one from the 4 best juvenile literature published in Japan. As a result, it appeared in Japanese in 300.000 copies, probably the largest printing from an Esperanto-based document. In total, over a million copies of Kumewawa were printed throughout the world.

&quot;Tempest above Aconcagua&quot; was a book that appealed across generations and to all parts of the world. His stories won prizes of Belartaj Konkursoj and his poetry, although sparse, is considered valuable and worth studying.
== Works ==
The works of Tibor Sekelj, novels and recordings of his travels, contain interesting ethnographic observations. He also wrote guides and essays on Esperanto, the international language. The majority of his books were originally written in Esperanto, but were translated into many national languages. Tibor Sekelj is undoubtedly the most often translated Esperanto author.

<doc id="614506" wikidata="Q188560" url="?curid=614506" title="Pierre Plantard">
<text>Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair (born Pierre Athanase Marie Plantard, 18 March 1920 – 3 February 2000) was a French technical artist, best known for being the principal fabricator of the Priory of Sion hoax, by which he claimed from the 1960s onwards that he was a male-line Merovingian descendant of Dagobert II and the &quot;Great Monarch&quot; prophesied by Nostradamus. Today in France, he is commonly regarded as a con artist.

==Early life==
Pierre Plantard was born in 1920 in Paris, the son of a butler and a concierge (described as a cook for wealthy families in police reports of the 1940s). Leaving school at 17, he became sacristan at the church of Saint-Louis d&#x27;Antin, in the 9th &quot;Arrondissement&quot; of Paris, and from 1937 began forming mystical ultranationalist associations like &quot;The French Union&quot; (1937) and &quot;French National Renewal&quot; (1941) to support a &quot;National Revolution&quot; based upon antisemitism and anti-Masonry.

===Occupation of France===
Following the dissolution of Grand Orient Freemasonry in Vichy France on 13 August 1940, Plantard wrote a letter dated 16 December 1940 to Marshal Philippe Pétain offering his services to the collaborationist government, referring to a &#x27;terrible Masonic and Jewish conspiracy&#x27;. On 21 April 1941, Plantard wrote to the Paris Police Prefecture that his group the French National Renewal was to take possession of the unoccupied premises located at 22 place Malesherbes, 1st floor &quot;which are currently let to an English Jew, Mr. Shapiro, who is presently fighting alongside his fellows in the British armed forces.&quot; By 1942, Plantard wanted to form another association, the Alpha Galates, membership prohibited to Jews, but the occupying German authorities refused permission.

===Alpha Galates===
The statutes of the Alpha Galates were deposited on 21 September 1942, describing itself as a tripartite order composed of the &quot;Temple&quot;, &quot;la Cité&quot; and &quot;les Arches&quot;. The Alpha Galates published a periodical called &quot;Vaincre - Pour une jeune chevalerie&quot; (&quot;Conquer - for a young knighthood&quot;), that lasted for six issues between September 1942 and February 1943, containing an anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic agenda; Plantard&#x27;s disregard of the prohibition by the German authorities of the formation of the Alpha Galates earned him a four-month sentence in Fresnes Prison. The Statutes of the Alpha Galates existed in the German language as well as French.

Claude Charlot of the Paris Prefecture of Police stated on a CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot; documentary that the Alpha Galates &quot;had only four regular members&quot;. According to a police report on the Alpha Galates dated 13 February 1945, the organisation was only composed of at most 50 members, who resigned one after the other as soon as they sized up the president of the association (Pierre Plantard) and figured out that it was not a serious enterprise.

===Post war activities===
Following the Liberation, Plantard tried to transform the Alpha Galates into a resistance group and in 1947, tried to form &quot;The Latin Academy&quot;.

On July 8, 1951, he was initiated into Freemasonry in the Grand Orient de France by the lodge L’Avenir du Chablais in Ambilly.

In 1951, Plantard married Anne-Léa Hisler (1930–1970). They lived in the town of Annemasse in south-east France, near the border with Switzerland, until their separation in 1956. At the same time Plantard worked as a draughtsman for the company &quot;établissements Chanovin&quot;. In 1972, he married Anne-Marie Cavaille who originated from Montauban, with Philippe de Chérisey acting as best man.

According to the late Robert Amadou (1924–2006), Pierre Plantard in 1953 was accused of selling degrees of esoteric orders for exorbitant sums. According to a more reliable source, given in a letter written by Léon Guersillon the Mayor of Annemasse in 1956, contained in the folder holding the 1956 Statutes of the Priory of Sion in the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, Plantard was given a six-month sentence in December 1953 for &quot;abus de confiance&quot; (breach of trust), relating to other crimes. French researchers dispute the connection between Robert Amadou and Pierre Plantard.

===Priory of Sion===

On 25 June 1956, Pierre Plantard and André Bonhomme legally registered in the town of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois a new association called the &quot;Priory of Sion&quot;, based in Annemasse close to the French border near Geneva. The group was devoted to the support of building low-cost housing in Annemasse, and criticising local government through its journal &quot;Circuit&quot;. The &quot;Sion&quot; in the name did not refer to the ancient Land of Israel, but to a local mountain, Mont-Sion (or Mont-de-Sion), where the order (according to its statutes) intended to establish a retreat center. The association dissolved by December 1956.

===Committee of Public Safety and Captain Way===
By 1958, Plantard was back living in Paris where he was actively supporting General de Gaulle during the Algerian Crisis, establishing his own version of a Committee of Public Safety (calling it the &#x27;Central Committee&#x27;) based in Paris, using the name &quot;Captain Way&quot;, claiming it was part of the official Committee based in Algeria founded by General Jacques Massu. De Gaulle did not support the existence of any of the Committees of Public Safety, gave Algeria free elections and the country eventually got its independence, endorsed by de Gaulle, in 1962.

===Alleged letters from General de Gaulle===

In 1959, Plantard edited a second series of the journal &quot;Circuit&quot;, subtitled &quot;Publication Périodique Culturelle de la Fédération des Forces Françaises&quot;. It never mentioned the Priory of Sion in its pages, and dealt with paranormal and mystical topics. At the same time, Plantard was offering his services as a clairvoyant under the name of &quot;Chyren&quot;.

It was in this second series of &quot;Circuit&quot; that Plantard allegedly claimed he received a letter from President Charles de Gaulle dated 27 June 1959. Louis Vazart referred to a letter to Plantard from de Gaulle dated 29 July 1958, also referring to another similar letter from de Gaulle dated 3 August 1958 where he allegedly thanked Plantard for his support during the Algerian crisis. None of these alleged letters from de Gaulle have ever been produced.

==Priory of Sion hoax==
===Gisors===
In 1961, author Gérard de Sède had an article published in &quot;Noir et blanc&quot; about the Château de Gisors in Normandy, linked to the claims of Roger Lhomoy who, since 1946, alleged it contained the treasure of the Knights Templar. Plantard read the article and wrote to de Sède, later collaborating with him on the book &quot;Les Templiers sont parmi nous, ou, L&#x27;Enigme de Gisors&quot; (&quot;The Templars are Amongst Us, or The Enigma of Gisors&quot;), that was published in 1962. The name Priory of Sion reappeared within the pages of this book.

===Rennes-le-Château===
In 1962, author Robert Charroux published his book &quot;Trésors du monde&quot; telling the story of Noël Corbu, who claimed the 19th century priest Bérenger Saunière had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile in the village of Rennes-le-Château. This inspired Plantard to write his own book on the subject matter but, failing to find a publisher his manuscript was extensively rewritten by Gérard de Sède resulting in the 1967 book, &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot;. The book adapted Corbu&#x27;s story to fit-in with Plantard&#x27;s claims about the survival of the line of Merovingian king Dagobert II, and Plantard began claiming to be descended from Dagobert II since 1964 when he began depositing false documents in the Bibliothèque nationale giving the secret history of the Priory of Sion.

These Priory of Sion documents contained false genealogies attaching Plantard&#x27;s family tree to another genealogy found in an article by Louis Saurel in the French magazine &quot;Les Cahiers de l&#x27;Histoire&quot; Number 1 (1960). Plantard originally claimed these genealogies had been compiled by a Doctor Hervé and Abbé Pichon (a historical person, 1828–1905), originally at the request of Napoleon Bonaparte, who found out about the Merovingian survival from Abbé Sieyès. Plantard added that Abbé Pierre Plantard, former vicar of the Basilica of St. Clotilde, Paris (falsely claiming they were related), drew up genealogies giving the survival of the line of Dagobert II on 18 March 1939. Philippe de Chérisey, Plantard&#x27;s friend and accomplice, later claimed that Abbé Pichon was the pseudonym of François Dron (a completely different historical person who was a numismatist).

When Jean-Luc Chaumeil revealed during the 1980s that Plantard&#x27;s genealogical claims were fictional adaptations of Louis Saurel&#x27;s article published in 1960, Plantard released a &quot;cheque&quot; dated 14 April 1960 showing his former wife Anne-Léa Hisler had been paid for the article contained in &quot;Les Cahiers de l&#x27;Histoire&quot;, and therefore claiming she was the original author.

The Priory Documents of the 1960s gave a revised history of the Priory of Sion, claiming it had been founded by Godfrey of Bouillon during the Crusades and named after Mount Sion in Jerusalem, conflating it with a genuine historical monastic order, the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion.

De Sède&#x27;s book was most famous for its reproduction of two &quot;parchments&quot; that were allegedly discovered by Saunière that hinted at the survival of the line of Dagobert II. However, Plantard and de Sède fell out over book royalties following the publication of &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; in 1967 and Philippe de Chérisey, Plantard&#x27;s friend and accomplice, announced he had forged the &quot;parchments&quot;. But it was due to the success of de Sède&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; that Pierre Plantard became famous, as the guardian of the secret of Rennes-le-Château.

By 1978, Plantard began claiming that his grandfather had met Bérenger Saunière in Rennes-le-Château, and that the real source of Saunière&#x27;s wealth was the Abbé Henri Boudet, parish priest of the nearby village of Rennes-les-Bains.

===Parchments and genealogies hoax===
When the &quot;parchments&quot; were originally published in Gérard de Sède&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; in 1967, it was claimed there were four parchments originally discovered by Saunière in the hollow pillar of his church. In “L&#x27;Enigme de Rhedae” (1964) Henri Lobineau said that Saunière discovered documents bearing the royal seal of Blanche of Castile, giving the line of Dagobert II drawn up by Abbé Pichon between 1805 and 1814, using documents found during the Revolution. The parchments said the Merovingians were descended from the Tribe of Benjamin and Dagobert II had hidden an ‘accursed’ treasure in Rennes-le-Château.

This was elaborated upon in a 1965 Priory document by stating it was Abbé Antoine Bigou, one of Saunière&#x27;s predecessor curés at Rennes-le-Château, who hid the parchments in 1790 in the hollow pillar that supported the church altar, after finding out about the secret of Rennes-le-Château on 17 January 1781 at the deathbed of Marie de Negri d&#x27;Ables, Marquise d&#x27;Hautpoul-Blanchefort. There were four parchments altogether, two of which were reproduced in Gérard de Sède’s forthcoming book (their contents were described in this 1965 document) and the other two containing genealogies made by the Abbé Bigou (running from 1548 to 1789) and Henri Lobineau (running from 1780 to 1915).

When in 1967 de Chérisey announced that the parchments published in &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; were fakes, different claims were introduced about the exact nature of Sauniere&#x27;s discovery. Based on a 1966 fake letter that appeared in &quot;Dossiers Secrets&quot; allegedly written by the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, being an adaptation of material contained in a 1964 book by René Descadeillas involving François-Pierre d&#x27;Hautpoul, these revised claims appeared in a 1977 Priory document by Jean Delaude, &quot;Le Cercle d&#x27;Ulysse&quot;. This revised version of the story stayed more-or-less intact right up to 1990, containing minor variations involving exact dates. The 1977 Priory document claimed Saunière discovered three documents: 1) a genealogy of the Counts of Rhedae dated 1243 bearing the seal of Blanche of Castile, 2) a document of 1608 relating to François-Pierre d&#x27;Hautpoul providing a complementary genealogy from 1240 onwards and, 3) a last will and testament of Henri d&#x27;Hautpoul dated 24 April 1695 bearing the stamp and signature of the testator, adding they were originally sold by Saunière&#x27;s niece Madame James to two Englishmen, Captain Ronald Stansmore and Sir Thomas Frazer of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers. Then repeating again that the parchments given in &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; were fakes by Philippe de Chérisey.

In 1978 Philippe de Chérisey repeated the parchments had been sold by Madame James to Captain Ronald Stanmore and Sir Thomas Frazer, adding they were deposited in a Safe deposit box of Lloyds Bank; and following an article in &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, &quot;the demand for the recognition of Merovingian rights made in 1955 and 1956 by Sir Alexander Aikman, Sir John Montague Brocklebank, Major Hugh Murchison Clowes and nineteen other men in the office of Notary Public, P. J. F. Freeman.&quot; In 1981 Plantard circulated a French newspaper cutting of unknown provenance stating the parchments were stored in a Safe deposit box of Lloyds Bank, London.

A book published in 1983 by Louis Vazart reproduced two fake &quot;notarised documents&quot; allegedly dating from October 1955 naming Captain Ronald Stansmore Nutting (altered from Captain Ronald Stansmore), Major Hugh Murchison Clowes and the Right Honourable Viscount Leathers as the legal owners of the parchments discovered by Saunière &quot;whose value cannot be estimated&quot;, and requesting the parchments - all containing proof of the survival of the line of Dagobert II - to be removed from France. The Notary Public was named as Maître Patrick Francis Jourdan Freeman.

Another &quot;notarised document&quot; that was later reproduced in &quot;Vaincre&quot; Number 1 (1990), gave the caption &quot;after a photograph taken by Etienne Plantard in London in 1958&quot;, naming only Captain R.S. Nutting as the owner of the &quot;parchments&quot;. The firm of solicitors was given as John Newton &amp; Sons, London.

In 1989, when Plantard revised his claims about the Priory of Sion, it was stated in a 1989 issue of &quot;Vaincre&quot;: &quot;The parchments of Blanche of Castile were in Etienne Plantard&#x27;s safe-deposit box in London since November 1955 and they did not &#x27;mention&#x27; Dagobert, or a Dagobert II and Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair was never &#x27;a Merovingian pretender&#x27; to the throne of France: His lineage results from the Counts de Rhédae and by the female line of Saint Clair-sur-Epte, which has no relationship with &#x27;Sinclair&#x27;.&quot;

===Plantard de Saint Clair===
From 1975, Pierre Plantard used the surname &quot;Plantard de Saint-Clair&quot;, described as an epithet by Jean-Luc Chaumeil, following his interview with Plantard in the magazine &quot;l’Ère d’Aquarius&quot;. The &quot;Saint-Clair&quot; part of his surname was added to his real surname on the basis that this was the family name associated with the area of Gisors associated with his hoax - according to the mythology of the Priory of Sion &quot;Jean VI des Plantard&quot; married a member of the House of Gisors during the 12th century. Plantard also appropriated the false titles of &quot;Comte de Saint-Clair&quot; and &quot;Comte de Rhédæ&quot; to himself.

===The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail===
In 1982, authors Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln published &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;. It became a bestseller and publicized Plantard&#x27;s Priory of Sion story, treating seriously the content of the Priory of Sion documents of the 1960s and 1970s. The book added a new element to the story, that the Merovingian line of kings had actually been descended from the historical Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and that the purpose of the Priory (and its military arm, the Knights Templar) was to protect the secret of the Jesus bloodline. Pierre Plantard was hypothesised as the direct descendant of Jesus Christ.

In February 1982, Plantard dismissed &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; as fiction on a French radio interview, and later even dismissed the Priory of Sion documents of the 1960s and 1970s as false and irrelevant.

===Revised claims===
A new revived series of &quot;Vaincre&quot; appeared during the late 1980s, containing a &quot;good luck message from Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&quot;, proponent of the United States of Europe, as well as an article attributed to Frederick Forsyth.

Plantard revised his Priory of Sion story, claiming the order was founded on 17 January 1681 in Rennes-le-Château, based upon documents discovered in Barcelona, relating to a secret involving the mystical power of ley lines and sunrise lines, and &quot;Rocco Negro&quot; (Black Rock), a promontory near Rennes-le-Château where he owned substantial property. The alleged contents of the &quot;parchments&quot; allegedly discovered by Saunière were revised and altered (see above). The genealogies contained in Jean Delaude&#x27;s Priory document &quot;Le Cercle d&#x27;Ulysse&quot; were also revised. The previous claims found in the notarised documents published in Vazart&#x27;s book in 1983 were made out of &quot;errors of decipherment&quot; and were falsified because of &quot;political pressures of 1956&quot;.

In a letter dated 4 April 1989, Plantard wrote that Victor Hugo &quot;drew up the constitutions of the Priory of Sion on 14 July 1870, on the same day that he planted the oak-tree of the United States of Europe&quot;.

In 1990, Plantard revised himself by claiming he was only descended from a cadet branch of the line of Dagobert II, while arguing that the direct descendant was really Otto von Habsburg, actually descended from Sigebert I (nicknamed &quot;Plant-Ard&quot;), different from Sigebert IV, who was the son of Bera II and the grandson of Wamba, the founding father of the House of Habsburg and also the builder of Habsburg Castle, drawing on content found in a 1979 book by Jean-Luc Chaumeil.

===Roger-Patrice Pelat and downfall===
A 1989 Priory of Sion circular cited Roger-Patrice Pelat as a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. Pelat was a friend of the then President of France François Mitterrand and centre of a scandal involving French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy. This initiative by Plantard had an unexpected consequence; in October 1993, the judge investigating the Pelat scandal had Pierre Plantard&#x27;s house searched. The search failed to find any documents related to Pelat, but turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true king of France. Plantard admitted under oath he had fabricated everything, including Pelat&#x27;s involvement with the Priory of Sion.

Plantard was later threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in southern France. He was 74 years old at the time.

== Death ==
Nothing more was heard of Plantard until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000. His remains were cremated.

<doc id="614509" wikidata="Q466425" url="?curid=614509" title="Jeff Chandler (boxer)">
<text>&quot;Joltin&#x27;&quot; Jeff Chandler (born September 3, 1956, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a former boxer. Chandler reigned as the Lineal and WBA world Bantamweight Champion from November 1980 to April 1984.

==Professional boxing career==
The 5&#x27;7&quot; (67 inches - 1.70 metres) tall Philadelphian began his professional career with a four-round draw in 1976 after only two amateur bouts. Chandler then began a four-year string of victories culminating in a challenge for the world&#x27;s lineal and WBA 118-pound championship held by Julian Solís. On November 14, 1980, Chandler won the title by a fourteenth-round knockout in Miami, becoming the first American fighter to hold the bantamweight crown in over 30 years.

Chandler&#x27;s first defence was against former champion Jorge Luján, winning on points in fifteen rounds. He then travelled to Japan to face Asian champion Eljiro Murata, and although he was almost floored in the early rounds, Chandler came back to hold his title with a draw. Many ringside observers felt Chandler deserved a clear points victory. With his status in the boxing world rising, Chandler followed this up with a repeat victory over Solis, this time in seven rounds. Chandler finished 1981 against Murata, earning a thirteenth-round knockout rematch win.

In March 1982, Chandler faced the only opponent who ever defeated him as an amateur, fellow Philadelphian Johnny Carter. The tables were turned this time as he scored a sixth-round knockout on national television. Soon after, Chandler was sidelined by an injury sustained in a street-fight. During a traffic altercation in Philadelphia, he was stabbed on the right shoulder with a broken bottle, leaving a distinctive circular scar, but doing no permanent damage. Chandler went on to defend his title by beating Miguel Iriarte before finishing 1982.

In 1983, Chandler ventured into the Super bantamweight ranks, winning a ten-round decision over Hector Cortez. He then faced tough Angelino Oscar Muniz in another non-title bout. Muniz took the fight to Chandler, winning narrowly on points over ten rounds, Chandler&#x27;s first defeat in the professional ranks. He defended once more against Murata (another knockout, in the tenth round), then faced Muniz again, this time with the title on the line. A severe cut over Muniz&#x27;s eye brought a stoppage in the seventh round, enabling Chandler to retain his belt by a seventh-round technical knockout.

On April 7, 1984, Chandler faced the undefeated contender Richie Sandoval. This time his skills were not enough to stop an eager young foe. Sandoval took the title with a fifteenth-round knockout. This turned out to be Chandler&#x27;s last fight. He elected to have surgery on cataracts that had been diagnosed the year before. Rather than risk blindness, Chandler retired from boxing.

He finished his career with a record of 33 wins, 2 losses and 2 draws. Jeff Chandler provided boxing fans with many memorable performances. In 2000, he was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame at Canastota, New York.

<doc id="614511" wikidata="Q2004210" url="?curid=614511" title="USS Stout">
<text>USS &quot;Stout&quot; (DDG-55) is the fifth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer. Built for the United States Navy by Ingalls Shipbuilding, she was commissioned on 13 August 1994 and she is currently home-ported in Naval Station Norfolk. She is part of Destroyer Squadron 28. &quot;Stout&quot; is named for Rear Admiral Herald F. Stout, who distinguished himself as the commanding officer of the destroyer during World War II. In November 1943, Commander Stout received two Navy Crosses in the span of three weeks for his actions in the Pacific. Stout aided Destroyer Squadron 23 in sinking five heavily armed Japanese warships and damaging four others during the Solomon Islands campaign as well as sinking four more Japanese warships and damaging two others to establish a beachhead on Bougainville Island. &quot;Stout&quot; was ordered on 13 December 1988, the keel was laid down on 8 August 1991, she was launched on 16 October 1992 and commissioned on 13 August 1994. As of January 2024 the ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 28 based out of Naval Station Norfolk.

==Ship history==
===Board of Inspection and Survey===
In April 2008, the ship comprehensively failed her Board of Inspection and Survey examination and was declared &quot;unfit for sustained combat operations.&quot; The ship has since passed 13 of 13 rigorous unit level training inspections. &quot;Stout&quot; deployed in March 2009 on routine security operations in the Sixth Fleet operational area. On 15 July 2009, Fox News Channel reported &quot;Stout&quot; was in the Black Sea cooperating with Georgian forces in training exercises.

===Relief of Commanding Officer and several subordinates===
On 1 March 2011 while on deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in support of the crisis in Libya, &quot;Stout&quot;″s commanding officer, Command Master Chief, and eight other junior officers and non-commissioned officers were relieved by the Commander Sixth Fleet. The cited cause was a &quot;pervasive pattern of unprofessional behavior&quot; among the ship&#x27;s crew including &quot;fraternization, orders violations and disregard for naval standards of conduct and behavior which contributed to poor crew morale and a hostile command climate.&quot;

===Operation Odyssey Dawn===

On 19 March 2011, in conjunction with other US Navy ships, the destroyer launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at Libyan air defenses as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn.

===Syrian civil war===
On 28 August 2013, the US Navy announced that &quot;Stout&quot;, was en route to join four other &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers deployed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea amid allegations that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons during the ongoing Syrian civil war, including the 2013 Ghouta attacks.

===Navy record for longest stint at sea===

On 3 October 2020, &quot;Stout&quot; moored in Rota, Spain, after 215 days consecutively at sea, surpassing the Navy&#x27;s known record of 206 days at sea previously held by carrier and cruiser . The unusually long deployment was as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and operational requirements.

==Honors and awards==
On 16 February 2007, &quot;Stout&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot;.

==Coat of arms==

=== Shield === 
The battle axe is adapted from the Stout family&#x27;s coat of arms. Its upright position underscores &quot;Stout&quot;″s massive firepower and high survivability while the double axe head alludes to the all encompassing offensive and defensive power of the integrated AEGIS combat system. The star highlights Rear Admiral Stout&#x27;s many awards, including the Silver Star. With resolute courage and daring aggressiveness, then Commander Stout aided his task force in sinking several Japanese warships to establish a beachhead on Bougainville Island. This Naval battle is symbolized by the wedge piercing the field of the shield. The wedge and field represents Rear Admiral Stout and the United States Navy&#x27;s ability to disable and destroy a surface force of superior firepower.

=== Crest ===
The cross symbolizes the two Navy Crosses Rear Admiral Stout was awarded as well as exemplifies the strong devotion to God and Country that characterized his Naval career. It is inflamed to recall the fierce naval battle during the Solomon Islands campaign. The lion is a metaphor for the courage and strength which Rear Admiral Stout and his crew had during World War II and to those who have served on board &quot;Stout&quot; (DDG-55).

<text>Thomas Goffe (1591–1629) was a minor Jacobean dramatist.

==Life==

Thomas Goffe was born in Essex in 1591. He first studied at Westminster School where he had the status of a Queen&#x27;s Scholar. Goffe received a scholarship on 3 November 1609 to attend Christ Church, Oxford. Here he received his bachelor of arts (B.A.) on 17 June 1613 and continued to get his master of arts (M.A.), on 20 June 1616. While involved with acting and writing plays at Christ Church, Goffe continued school. On 3 July 1623, he acquired his bachelor of divinity and became licensed to preach shortly after on 11 July 1623. Goffe was asked to be a rector of the church in East Clandon, Surrey after receiving his B.D., an offer worth about eight pounds a year.(1) However, Goffe began delivering Latin orations and writing poems in tribute to Sir Thomas Bodley and Queen Anne of Denmark as well as to the dean of Christ Church, William Godwin.

He lived alone the majority of his life because of his dislike for women. He was considered a women-hater and lived as a bachelor until he gave in to a woman and married her in East Clandon. This woman was the widow of Goffe&#x27;s predecessor and had pretended to fall in love with his preaching. He was warned by his good friend from Oxford, Thomas Thimble, that she will eventually break his heart and he would be better off without her. Unfortunately, Goffe went with his gut instinct, and was tortured by the marriage. She was consistently stubborn and disrespectful towards Goffe and his friends. For instance, when few of Goffe&#x27;s friends from Oxford stopped by Goffe&#x27;s house, his wife looked at them with an &quot;ill Eye&quot; and served then eggs and milk for dinner. Embarrassed by his wife&#x27;s actions, Goffe ordered a better dinner for his friends the following night and gave them some wine. His wife and her children from her previous marriage continued to disrespect Goffe and are blamed for his death which occurred on 27 July 1629, shortly after his wedding day.

==His work==

Thomas Goffe was an active playwright during his days at Christ Church. Since it is unknown the order in which his plays were written, scholars believe that his first play was most likely &quot;The Raging Turk&quot;, also titled &quot;Bajazet II&quot;. The play is a tragedy and was produced at Christ Church circa 1613–1618. However, the play was published after his death in 1631. Goffe&#x27;s second play in believed to be &quot;The Tragedy of Orestes&quot; which was produced circa 1613–1618 and published in 1633. His final play produced at the Christ Church was &quot;The Courageous Turk&quot;, or &quot;Amurath the First&quot;. It was produced on 21 September 1618 and published in 1632. All of his plays were published in 1 volume as Three Excellent Tragedies in 1656.

There is no evidence available to verify the dates of these three plays. However, the structure, crude dialogue, and the use of, Richard Knolles&#x27;s &quot;The General Historie of the Turkes&quot; as a source of inspiration, suggest that &quot;The Raging Turk&quot; is Goffe&#x27;s first play. Furthermore, Goffe&#x27;s &quot;The Courageous Turk&quot;, contains a few lines from the prologue that imply this was the third play to be acted in front of Christ Church. The lines are as follows:

&quot;Our hope which intends,/
The sacred Muses Progeny to greet,/
Which under roofe, now the third time meet…&quot; 

&quot;The Raging Turk&quot; is a tragedy of Emperor Bajazet II, who is desperately trying to hold onto his power. However, plotting sons, and a usurping brother prevent him from doing so. While trying to prevent his successor, confusion consumes the people, and leads to the death of at least 16 lives. The end of the play resolves with Bajazet being poisoned, and his grandson Solyman is crowned emperor. Many scholars believe in this play, “Goffe appears to be fascinated with the reputed evil of the Turks and their insatiable greed.

&quot;The Tragedy of Orestes&quot; is the story of Aegisthus’s murder of Agamemnon with Clytemnestra’s help. Orestes, unsure of who murdered his father, asks the help of his good friend, Plyades. Together, the two of them dress in disguise and let it be rumoured that they have killed themselves by jumping off a cliff. Orestes is told that if he brings his fathers bones to a magic woman named Canidia, she will reveal his father’s murderer. When the truth is revealed, Orestes kills the baby born of Aegisthus and his mother and forces the parents to drink the child’s blood. After Aegisthus and Clytemnestra are killed on stage, Orestes is denied the crown and banished. Eventually, Orestes and Pylades die by running on each other’s sword.

&quot;The Courageous Turk&quot; breaks into two parts. The first part is concerned with Amurath’s passion for his concubine Eumorphe, his officers’ discontent with Amurath’s affair, and death of Eumorphe. The second part contains a series of events consisting of Amurath’s various war exploits in Serbia (Battle of Kosovo), the Christians&#x27; martial confusion, the marriage of Amurath&#x27;s son Bajazet to Hatam, Amurath&#x27;s conflict with his son-in-law Aladin, the mutual stabbing deaths of Amurath and the Christian Capitan Cobelitz, and the raising of Bajazet to Emperor with the subsequent death of his brother Jacup.

==Criticism and controversy==

Goffe&#x27;s &quot;The Courageous Turk&quot; has received some unfavorable criticism. It has been called &quot;all but unendurable&quot; because of its &quot;outrageous rant and bombast&quot; by Felix Shelling in &quot;Elizabethan Drama&quot; (1908) and also called a &quot;repulsive bombast&quot; by Adolphus Ward in &quot;A History of English Dramatic Literature to the Death of Queen Anne&quot; (1875). However, &quot;The Courageous Turk&#x27;s&quot; audience in the seventeenth-century liked the play because of the character of Amurath, the elaborate staging, the subject of Turkish history, and Goffe&#x27;s vision the frailty of kings and the ultimate reward given to Christians who fought against earth&#x27;s heathens.

There is specific evidence that suggests that Goffe knew of and responded to Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Phoenissae&quot;. Two of his tragedies, &quot;Tragedy of Orestes&quot; and &quot;The Courageous Turk&quot;, contain speeches translated from Seneca&#x27;s play. In &quot;The Courageous Turk&quot;, the speeches of a Turkish princess intervening in a quarrel between her father and husband are liberally adapted from a scene in &quot;Phoenissae&quot; in which Jocasta, the wife of Oedipus, comes between her warring sons. Ben Jonson said, in a conversation recorded by Bishop Plume, &quot;So Tom Goff brings in Etiocles and Polynices.&quot; Ben Jonson was much admired at Christ Church, and may have been invited to read a manuscript play by Goffe on the theme of the &quot;Phoenissae&quot;. In addition, unlike many writers and producers of academic drama in the Jacobean era, Goffe was not contemptuous of popular theatre, and included many scenes and lines that were influenced by &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in his tragedy, &quot;Orestes&quot;. &quot;Phoenissae&quot; has also been attributed to Goffe. It was probably performed at Christ Church in 1619 but is now lost.

Goffe is also believed by some to have authored &quot;The Careless Shepherdess&quot;, a pastoral that was probably produced at Christ Church between 1618 and 1629, and later revised and produced by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men around 1638. However, the argument against this belief is that Goffe could not have authored the pastoral because of the statement on the title page of &quot;The Careless Shepherdess&quot;, which states that it was acted at Salisbury Court, a theatre that did not open until after Goffe died.

<text>All Hallows College was a college of higher education in Dublin. It was founded in 1842 and was run by the Vincentians from 1892 until 2016. On 23 May 2014, it was announced that it was closing because of declining student enrollment. The sale of the campus in Drumcondra to Dublin City University was announced on 19 June 2015 and completed on 8 April 2016. The college closed on 30 November 2016, becoming the All Hallows Campus of Dublin City University.

==History==
The college was founded in 1842 by Reverend John Hand and, from 1892 until its closure in 2016, was under the direction of Vincentians.

By 1973, the college had trained 4000 priests for England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, South America, South Africa, India, Canada, Australia, the West Indies, New Zealand, and the United States. All-Hallows alumni were the largest group of secular priests in California up to the late 1890s.

The name of the Monastery may also originate from the fact that the lands it was built upon once belonged to the much older monastic foundations of the Priory of All Hallows owned by the Augustinians and founded by Diarmaid mac Murchadha in 1166, but later dissolved under the Reformation. The general area of Drumcondra back then was commonly known as Clonturk or Ceann Torc of North, Dublin.

The academic training for a priest took seven years, of which three were devoted to physics, mental philosophy, languages, and English literature; the remaining four years were devoted to sacred scripture, history, liturgy, canon law, sacred eloquence, and the science of theology.

Up until 1891, the college was run on a voluntary basis, not under any particular Catholic body, following a number of disputes with the hierarchy and Cardinal Cullen, over the administration of the College, and increased nationalism in the college following on from the Land League and Home rule movements, following intervention from the pope, the Vincentians were placed in charge of the college.

The church organ was built in 1898 by Telford &amp; Telford of Dublin.

After its establishment in 1909, some students would take examinations for the National University of Ireland, as some students had previously done with its predecessor the Royal University of Ireland from 1936 All Hallows students attended UCD&#x27;s Earlsfort Terrace for their degree courses.

In autumn 1955, while on holiday in Ireland, Senator John F. Kennedy addressed students of All Hallows at the invitation of Fr. Joseph Leonard. His speech referred to the suppression of religion in the Soviet bloc.

===After the Second Vatican Council===
In the 1960s, after the Second Vatican Council, the college began accepting women from religious orders and also all Lay Students, offering adult education, and certificates, degrees and diplomas in theology, humanities and pastoral studies.

In 1976, the Vincentian retreat and conferencing in St. Joseph&#x27;s, Blackrock, moved to Purcell House, All Hallows. Similarly, in 1981 the Vincentian Mission Team moved to the College, from Blackrock, resulting in All Hallows being where missionaries returned to stay.

In 1982 the Diploma in Pastoral Leadership course commenced. The &quot;Pathways - Exploring Faith and Ministry&quot; adult education course for the dublin diocese commenced in 1985. 

In 1984, the Dominican College Girls Secondary school, Eccles St., transferred to a new school built on the northern part of All Hallows College lands, on Griffith Avenue.

The BA degree, a four-year programme in Theology with Philosophy, Psychology or Spirituality was validated by the Irish governments NCEA in 1988. In 1991 the Evening BA and MA by Research began, which was followed in 1993 by the taught MA programme.

In 1992 during the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the college, the &quot;All Hallows Association&quot; was set up by &quot;Pastmen&quot; former students of the college who had not proceeded to ordination. Also in 1992 the Sabbatical Renewal Programme commenced.

In 1997 in association with the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA), the Dept. of Education, and WIT, the first Certificate in Training and Development Adult Basic Education Management was run in All Hallows.

The final two ordinations took place in 1998 and the College ceased to be a seminary.

In 1999, the colleges degree programmes were validated by Dublin City University following on from NCEA. The undergraduate degrees based on subjects were recognised by the teaching council entitling graduates to teach in secondary schools in Ireland.

From 2003 to 2015, &quot;Preparing for Ministries&quot;, a version of the &quot;Pathways&quot; programme in All Hallows, was provided on an outreach basis, at various locations in the Diocese of Clogher. 

In 2008, the college, as with the Mater Dei, and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Drumcondra, became a college of Dublin City University.

In 2009 MA in Ecology and Religion run by the Missionary Society of St. Columban moved to the college and in 2012 the MA in Applied Spirituality moved from the Milltown Institute began being delivered by All Hallows.

In 2012, the &quot;International Peace Bureau&quot; conference was held in All Hallows, where President Michael D. Higgins presented the Sean McBride Prize.

In 2018 the &quot;All Hallows Alumni Network&quot; was set up to continue the connection between graduates of the college.

==Courses==
All Hallows College was home to programmes that provided students with the skills to promote fairness and equality in the workplace and in society: leadership and management in the pastoral arena, the community and voluntary sector and on all dialogue between public policy and social justice. Programmes were held in spirituality, supervisory practice and ecology and their application to questions and issues about the meaning of life that came up in work settings, therapeutic settings, family settings, relationships or in the context of social issues. The college enrolled 700 students.

The college offered joint major undergraduate degree courses (where the student&#x27;s two subjects were both considered majors and could both to be used as a basis for employment) in a combination of Theology and either Psychology, English Literature or Philosophy. These were offered under the Free Fees scheme that operates in Irish third-level education. Degree options were also available excluding Theology. In those instances, students applied directly to the college and paid full fees. The undergraduate degree courses were available to school leavers via the Dept. of Education&#x27;s Central Applications Office (CAO), yet about 50% of first-year students were mature students (aged 23 and over).

The college offered postgraduate programmes in Social studies such as Social Justice and Public Policy, Management: Community and Voluntary Services, Leadership and Pastoral Care, Christian Spirituality, Supervisory Practice and Ecology and Religion. Most of these taught courses had a graduate certificate and diploma stages prior to the MA stage. The college also offered research master&#x27;s and doctoral studies. All of the master&#x27;s and doctoral programmes were entitled to tax relief under the government scheme.

In 2017, the President of All Hallows College in conjunction with Dublin City University launched a strategic plan for the future called the Aisling (Vision) program in order to modernize the courses on offer in the college and also develop a stronger academic and resource links with its new partner institute, Dublin City University.

All Hallows ran adult and community learning courses.

As part of the reaction to the closure of the aerospace company in Dublin Airport under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) a tailored degree course was provided in All Hallows for some 70 former employees.

===Public talks===
The college ran a series of public talks each autumn and spring on subjects relating to the church, its mission and social justice, the 2015 spring series was entitled &quot;Reading the Signs of the Times - Urgent Questions for the Church today&quot;, with speakers including Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Fr. Peter McVerry SJ. Previous subjects have included &quot;Vatican II : The Journey Continues&quot; and &quot;The Joy of the Gospel: Evangelii Gaudium Exploring the Teaching of Pope Francis&quot;.

===Graduation===
Graduation took place every year on campus. The final graduation, 1 November 2016, was presided over by the vice-president, Mary McPhillips and the president of Dublin City University, Brian McCraith. Following the ceremony, a reception was held for graduates and their friends and families in the college dining hall.

==Exchange programmes==
The college engaged in the Erasmus student exchange programmes with Liverpool Hope University as well as the universities of Trier and Erfurt in Germany. All Hallows ran study abroad programmes with American universities such as DePaul University in Chicago and St. John&#x27;s University (New York) both also founded by Vincentians. The college also engaged in programmes with Webster University, St. Louis; the University of Missouri and Regis University, Denver.

==Facilities==
The college had a dining room, student common room, computer room, the &quot;John Hand&quot; library and study facilities. Students could use the facilities in Dublin City University and its sister colleges. Students had access to online learning via &quot;moodle&quot;. An archive of the college was hosted on campus. The college had on-campus accommodation for visiting students and groups. The &quot;Purcell House&quot; building hosted seminars, conferences, and workshops.

A number of non-profit organisations and charities such as Volunteer Missionary Movement, Daughters of Charity Education and Training Service, Ruhama (Supporting women affected by prostitution and human trafficking), Accord Catholic Marriage Counselling, Debt and Development Coalition Ireland, Console (Living with Suicide), Migraine Association of Ireland, National Association for Pastoral Counselling and Psychotherapy, Marys Meals, and Older Women&#x27;s Network (OWN) Ireland were based on campus.

On campus there is a monument to Fr. Hand and a graveyard where he and a number of other former presidents, professors and students of the college are buried. Deceased former students and staff are commemorated by trees planted on the college grounds.

The College Chapel was often used for concerts by choirs and musical societies, such as Liam Lawton, Dolce Choir, The Offbeat Ensemble, and the Dublin Airport Singers.

On 22 December 2003, the college hosted a special Christmas edition of RTÉs Marian Finucane Show with choirs for the northside of Dublin, and featured Brian Kennedy, Suzanne Murphy, Anúna, Bernadette Greevey and the Three American Tenors.

The BBC &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; show on 20 March 2016, featured a recording of Enya singing in the college chapel.

On 23 May 2014, it was announced that the College activities would be winding down due to financial difficulties, these were brought to the fore following a fundraising effort which included the sale of letters from Jackie Kennedy was cancelled. The College was not in receipt of direct state funding, and was capped at how many students it could accept on the Irish government&#x27;s free fees scheme. 
The winding down affected academic programmes in the short term, but a sabbatical course ran in 2014 and before and after Easter 2015. Efforts were made, liaising with DCU and its Colleges, to maintain the Adult Learning BA (ALBA) degree programme, which is the only one of its kind in Ireland. In September 2014 the College announced it was seeking a partnership or a sale of the campus to facilitate this, hoping to retain a presence on the campus and continue its mission.
Since 2015 the adult education Pathways programme has been run by the Dublin Dioceses Centre in Clonliffe College.
The final Faith Renewal programmes ran during the 2015 to 2016 academic years.

<text>A ship model basin is a basin or tank used to carry out hydrodynamic tests with ship models, for the purpose of designing a new (full sized) ship, or refining the design of a ship to improve the ship&#x27;s performance at sea. It can also refer to the organization (often a company) that owns and operates such a facility.

An engineering firm acts as a contractor to the relevant shipyards, and provides hydrodynamic model tests and numerical calculations to support the design and development of ships and offshore structures.

==History==

The eminent English engineer William Froude published a series of influential papers on ship designs for maximising stability in the 1860s. The Institution of Naval Architects eventually commissioned him to identify the most efficient hull shape. He validated his theoretical models with extensive empirical testing, using scale models for the different hull dimensions. He established a formula (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the picture) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws. His experiments were later vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship model basin was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today.

Inspired by Froude&#x27;s successful work, shipbuilding company William Denny and Brothers completed the world&#x27;s first commercial example of a ship model basin in 1883. The facility was used to test models of a variety of vessels and explored various propulsion methods, including propellers, paddles and vane wheels. Experiments were carried out on models of the Denny-Brown stabilisers and the Denny hovercraft to gauge their feasibility. Tank staff also carried out research and experiments for other companies: Belfast-based Harland &amp; Wolff decided to fit a bulbous bow on the liner &quot;Canberra&quot; after successful model tests in the Denny Tank.

== Test facilities ==
The hydrodynamic test facilities present at a model basin site include at least a towing tank and a cavitation tunnel and workshops. Some ship model basins have further facilities such as a maneuvering and seakeeping basin and an ice tank.

=== Towing tank ===


A towing tank is a basin, several metres wide and hundreds of metres long, equipped with a towing carriage that runs on two rails on either side. The towing carriage can either tow the model or follow the self-propelled model, and is equipped with computers and devices to register or control, respectively, variables such as speed, propeller thrust and torque, rudder angle etc. The towing tank serves for resistance and propulsion tests with towed and self-propelled ship models to determine how much power the engine will have to provide to achieve the speed laid down in the contract between shipyard and ship owner. The towing tank also serves to determine the maneuvering behaviour in model scale. For this, the self-propelled model is exposed to a series of zig-zag maneuvers at different rudder angle amplitudes. Post-processing of the test data by means of system identification results in a numerical model to simulate any other maneuver like Dieudonné spiral test or turning circles. Additionally, a towing tank can be equipped with a PMM (planar motion mechanism) or a CPMC (computerized planar motion carriage) to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments on ships or submerged objects under the influence of oblique inflow and enforced motions. The towing tank can also be equipped with a wave generator to carry out seakeeping tests, either by simulating natural (irregular) waves or by exposing the model to a wave packet that yields a set of statistics known as &quot;response amplitude operators&quot; (acronym &quot;RAO&quot;), that determine the ship&#x27;s likely real-life sea-going behavior when operating in seas with varying wave amplitudes and frequencies (these parameters being known as &quot;sea states&quot;). Modern seakeeping test facilities can determine these RAO statistics, with the aid of appropriate computer hardware and software, in a single test.

=== Cavitation tunnel ===
A cavitation tunnel is used to investigate propellers. This is a vertical water circuit with large diameter pipes. At the top, it carries the measuring facilities. A parallel inflow is established. With or without a ship model, the propeller, attached to a dynamometer, is brought into the inflow, and its thrust and torque is measured at different ratios of propeller speed (number of revolutions) to inflow velocity. A stroboscope synchronized with the propeller speed serves to visualize cavitation as if the cavitation bubble would not move. By this, one can observe if the propeller would be damaged by cavitation. To ensure similarity to the full-scale propeller, the pressure is lowered, and the gas content of the water is controlled.

=== Workshops ===
Ship model basins manufacture their ship models from wood or paraffin with a computerized milling machine. Some of them also manufacture their model propellers. Equipping the ship models with all drives and gauges and manufacturing equipment for non-standard model tests are the main tasks of the workshops.

=== Maneuvering and seakeeping basin ===
This is a test facility that is wide enough to investigate arbitrary angles between waves and the ship model, and to perform maneuvers like turning circles, for which the towing tank is too narrow. However, some important maneuvers like the spiral test still require even more space and still have to be simulated numerically after system identification.

=== Ice tank ===

An ice tank is used to develop ice breaking vessels, this tank fulfills similar purposes as the towing tank does for open water vessels. Resistance and required engine power as well as maneuvering behaviour are determined depending on the ice thickness. Also ice forces on offshore structures can be determined. Ice layers are frozen with a special procedure to scale down the ice crystals to model scale.

== Software ==
Additionally, these companies or authorities have CFD software and experience to simulate the complicated flow around ships and their rudders and propellers numerically. Today&#x27;s state of the art does not yet allow software to replace model tests in their entirety by CFD calculations. One reason, but not the only one, is that elementization is still expensive. Also the lines design of some of the ships is carried out by the specialists of the ship model basin, either from the beginning or by optimizing the initial design obtained from the shipyard. The same applies to the design of propellers.

== Examples ==
The ship model basins worldwide are organized in the ITTC (International Towing Tank Conference) to standardize their model test procedures.

<doc id="614516" wikidata="Q15057674" url="?curid=614516" title="Heung Jin Moon">
<text>Heung Jin Moon (; October 23, 1966 – January 2, 1984), also referred to by members of the Unification Church (UC) as Heung Jin Nim or posthumously as Lord Heung Jin Nim (), was the second son of church founders Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han. At the age of 17 he died in a vehicle accident in New York State. Three months later his parents conducted a spiritual wedding ceremony between him and Julia Pak, daughter of church leader, Bo Hi Pak. He is officially regarded by the UC to be the &quot;king of the spirits&quot; in heaven (ranking higher than Jesus). After Moon&#x27;s death, some church members claimed that they were channelling messages from his spirit. In 1988 a church member from Zimbabwe, named Kundioni, claimed to be the incarnation of Moon. His acts of violence against church members were a source of controversy within the church. Moon is now believed by church members to be leading workshops in the spiritual world in which spirits of deceased persons are taught UC teachings.

== Death at age 17 ==
On December 22, 1983, his car collided with a jackknifing tractor-trailer on an icy highway (State Route 9 in Hyde Park, New York) and he died on January 2. UC leader Chung Hwan Kwak stated: &quot;A truck lost control as it approached the car Heung Jin Nim was driving. Heung Jin Nim swerved the car to prevent the two friends who were with him from taking the brunt of the impact, and instead took it on himself.&quot;

== Spiritual marriage ==
Moon&#x27;s death came before his planned arranged marriage to ballerina Julia Pak, daughter of Moon&#x27;s interpreter, Bo Hi Pak. According to the tenets of Unificationism, only married couples may enter the highest level of heaven. His parents conducted a spiritual wedding ceremony three months later, February 20, 1984. Pak, who now uses the name Julia Moon, said: &quot;I will never forget in my whole life and for eternity this great honor of being Heung Jin Nim&#x27;s bride, which I do not deserve&quot;.

== Significance attributed to Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s death == 
The UC teaches that Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s death had cosmic significance, and that he is now in a position in heaven higher than Jesus. Sun Myung Moon explained that his son&#x27;s death was a great victory as it saved his own life; that his assassination by leftist terrorists was foiled on the same day as the accident, &quot;that his son&#x27;s loss was a providential act allowed by God in order to protect [Sun Myung] Moon&#x27;s calling&quot;, and that there was a karmic connection between the two events:

A week later Sun Myung Moon taught that Heung Jin Moon &quot;had a new mission and was free to travel between his spirit world and our physical world&quot;. He also &quot;proclaimed that Heung Jin became a leader to Jesus in the spirit realm&quot;.

Longtime president of the Korean UC Young Whi Kim wrote: &quot;They all refer to Heung Jin Nim as the new Christ. They also call him the Youth-King of Heaven. He is the King of Heaven in the spirit world. Jesus is working with him and always accompanies him. Jesus himself says that Heung Jin Nim is the new Christ. He is the center of the spirit world now. This means he is in a higher position than Jesus.&quot; Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s right-hand man Bo Hi Pak announced that Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s sacrifice &quot;carries far greater importance than the crucifixion of Jesus Christ&quot;.

==The &quot;return&quot; of the &quot;spirit&quot; of Heung Jin Moon==

=== Posthumous, widespread channeling of Moon&#x27;s spirit by Unification Church members ===
After Moon&#x27;s death, UC members around the world spoke to small groups of members, saying that the messages they were conveying were from Heung Jin Moon, being received by them spiritually (see Channelling (mediumistic)). Other members said they experienced automatic writing from him, or other kinds of spiritual communications from him. According to one report: &quot;Often it was unlikely people who [&#x27;channelled&#x27; him], even people who were not that spiritual. There was a sister in Britain called Faith Jones who gave guidance from him. A Dutch brother called Gerrit van Dorsten, who had been on the New York City Tribune also did.&quot; Andrea Higashibaba, then state leader of the UC in Tennessee, wrote an article in &quot;Today&#x27;s World&quot; magazine detailing her encounters (in spirit) with Heung Jin Moon, leading up to a &quot;liberation ceremony&quot; for deceased civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Soon many members around the world were &quot;channeling Heung Jin Nim.&quot; Typically these messages were ones of love and support.

===Black Heung Jin Nim===

Black Heung Jin Nim (also known as &quot;Second Self Heung Jin Nim&quot; and Cleopas Kundioni) refers to the alleged embodiment of the spirit of Heung Jin Moon in the body of a Zimbabwean member of the UC named Kundioni. Kundioni&#x27;s name was not known by most church members at the time, but he met with Sun Myung Moon and members of the &quot;True Family&quot;, who apparently accepted the &quot;Black Heung Jin Nim&quot; as a temporary union of the spirit of Heung Jin Moon with the mind and body of Kundioni.

Sun Myung Moon authorized the Black Heung Jin to travel the world, preaching and hearing the confessions of Unification Church members who had gone astray.&quot;

Kundioni came under criticism by both members and outsiders for his violence and harsh methods, including a beating that resulted in the hospitalization of church leader Bo Hi Pak. Church members do not believe that the severe violence was committed by the spirit of Heung Jin Moon. At a certain point after his world tour of Unification churches, Sun Myung Moon said that Kundioni was no longer channeling Heung Jin Moon, and sent him back to Africa.

====Viewpoints on channeling====
Several views of the phenomenon have emerged. Members generally believed that the channeling was legitimate at first, pointing to the endorsement by Sun Myung Moon. Some critics do not believe there ever was genuine channeling. Church members do not believe that the worst violence was committed by the spirit of Heung Jin Moon:

In 1987, leaders of the UC were told that Heung Jin Moon had returned to earth in the body of a Zimbabwean member. The African was accepted by Sun Myung Moon and church officials as Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s continuous channel - a &quot;twenty-four hour&quot; a day &quot;embodiment&quot; - and became known as &quot;the Black Heung Jin Nim.&quot;

With Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s approval he toured the world visiting Unification churches in a number of countries over several months, accompanied by church leaders and security guards. As channel for &quot;Lord Heung Jin Nim&quot; he was in a position of authority above that of all members, including top leaders apart from his parents Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han. Those members who confessed to certain sins received beatings; Damian Anderson (formerly a UC member) reports seeing him &quot;knock people&#x27;s heads together, hit them viciously with a baseball bat, smack them around the head, punch them, and handcuff them with golden handcuffs.&quot; Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s right-hand man Bo Hi Pak received a beating that was potentially life-threatening and required hospitalization. Anderson was particularly upset that top church officials and their assistants prevented people by force from leaving.

Church members believed that because the medium was a &quot;twenty-four hour&quot; &quot;embodiment&quot; or &quot;returning resurrection&quot; of Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s spirit, and that &quot;the Zimbabwean&#x27;s body was merely the instrument of Heung Jin Nim&#x27;s spirit&quot;, these were really the actions of Heung Jin Moon; Larry Moffitt, a church media executive, wrote:

:By January 1988, working at what one account described as &quot;an incredible pace,&quot; Heung Jin Nim in his new form conducted four special three-day conferences in Africa, then successive conferences in Greece, Thailand, Columbia, Argentina, France, England, America and the Far East. ... Heung Jin Nim conducted three conferences in the U.S.: at the World Mission Center in Manhattan, at the Washington, D.C. church, and at a church workshop site in the San Francisco Bay Area. These were attended by approximately 800 members each. He also conducted a smaller session at the church&#x27;s seminary at Barrytown, New York and several more private sessions. Most importantly, he met Rev. and Mrs. Moon and appeared to gain their sanction. According to one description, he &quot;ran over to Father and practically jumped into his arms, saying &#x27;Father! Father!&#x27; Then he embraced Mother tightly, crying, &#x27;Mother! Mother!&#x27; &quot; At the beginning of the New York conference, Hyo Jin Nim Moon, Heung Jin Nim&#x27;s elder brother, spoke in tears, stating, &quot;I have the most reason to be skeptical, but now I know it&#x27;s my brother. Please receive him.&quot; These conferences and the accompanying worldwide tour consummated the Heung Jin Nim revival but also terminated it. By summer 1988, Rev. Moon somewhat comically directed Heung Jin Nim&#x27;s embodiment to return to Africa, an order that he disobeyed, since he enjoyed the power that came with abusing members, just like Rev. Moon. At this point, there was a consensus that Heung Jin Nim&#x27;s spirit had left the embodiment and an evil spirit had taken over.

== Heung Jin Moon&#x27;s ongoing &quot;work in the spirit world&quot; ==
According to church teachings, Heung Jin Moon continues to do important work for the benefit of humanity, as leader of the spiritual realm. At large retreat seminars in Korea where for years thousands of Unificationists came from all over the world to rid themselves of evil spirits, Heung Jin Moon is said by the church to play an important role, as related by scholar of new religious movements Massimo Introvigne:

<text>George Harris Kennedy Jr. (February 18, 1925 – February 28, 2016) was an American actor who appeared in more than 100 film and television productions. He played &quot;Dragline&quot; in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role and being nominated for the corresponding Golden Globe. He received a second Golden Globe nomination for portraying Joe Patroni in &quot;Airport&quot; (1970).

Among other films in which he had a significant role are &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot;, &quot;Charade&quot;, &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot;, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, &quot;Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Mirage&quot;, &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot;, &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;, &quot;Guns of the Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;tick… tick… tick…&quot;, &quot;Cahill U.S. Marshal&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;, &quot;The Good Guys and the Bad Guys&quot;, &quot;Earthquake&quot;, &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; and &quot;The Delta Force&quot;.

Kennedy is the only actor to appear in all four films in the &quot;Airport&quot; series, reprising the role of Joe Patroni three times. He also portrays Police Captain Ed Hocken in the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series of films, and corrupt oil tycoon Carter McKay on the original &quot;Dallas&quot; television series.

== Early life, education and military service ==
Kennedy was born on February 18, 1925, in New York City, into a show business family. His father, George Harris Kennedy, a musician and orchestra leader, died when Kennedy was four years old. He was raised by his mother, Helen A. (née Kieselbach), a ballet dancer. His maternal grandfather was a German immigrant; his other ancestry was Irish and English.

Kennedy made his stage debut at age 2 in a touring company of &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, and by age 7, he was a New York City radio DJ.

Kennedy graduated in 1943 from Chaminade High School in Mineola, Long Island, New York.

Kennedy enlisted in the United States Army during World War II in 1943. He served 16 years, reaching the rank of captain. Kennedy served in the infantry under George S. Patton, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and earned two Bronze Stars. He re-enlisted after the war, and he was discharged in the late 1950s due to a back injury.

== Career ==

His first notable screen role was a military policeman on the TV sitcom &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, for which he also served as a technical adviser to ensure accuracy for the show&#x27;s military base setting. Kennedy later described the Silvers show as &quot;a great training ground&quot;.

His film career began in 1961 in &quot;The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come&quot;. He appeared in several Hollywood movies, including as a sadistic jail guard in the Kirk Douglas modern Western &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962), a ruthless criminal in the Cary Grant suspense film &quot;Charade&quot; (1963) and in the Joan Crawford thriller &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964).

Kennedy was busy in 1965. He appeared with Gregory Peck in the mystery &quot;Mirage&quot;, with a large cast led by James Stewart in the plane-crash adventure &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, with John Wayne in the war film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way,&quot; and with Wayne and Dean Martin in the Western &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot;.

He played the character Blodgett in a 1966 episode &quot;Return to Lawrence&quot; of the series &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967) for his performance as Dragline, a chain-gang convict who at first resents the new prisoner in camp played by Paul Newman, then comes to idolize the rebellious Luke.

Kennedy followed with films such as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, &quot;Bandolero!&quot; and &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;. In 1970, he appeared in the disaster film &quot;Airport&quot;, in which he plays one of its main characters, airline troubleshooter Joe Patroni. He reprises this role in &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; and &quot;The Concorde ... Airport &#x27;79&quot;, the only cast member to appear in each film of the series.

The &quot;Airport&quot; franchise helped inspire the Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker satire &quot;Airplane!&quot;, in which the filmmakers hoped to cast Kennedy as the bumbling plane dispatcher. The role went to Lloyd Bridges because Kennedy &quot;couldn&#x27;t kill off his &quot;Airport&quot; cash-cow&quot;, Jerry Zucker said in 2010.

Kennedy co-starred with Clint Eastwood in &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; and &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot;, and with ensemble casts in the disaster film &quot;Earthquake&quot; and the Agatha Christie mystery &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;.

He also starred in two television series: &quot;Sarge&quot;, which aired from 1971 to 1972 and &quot;The Blue Knight&quot; from 1975 to 1976.

Kennedy starred in two Japanese productions, Junya Satō&#x27;s &quot;Proof of the Man&quot; in 1977 and Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s &quot;Virus&quot; in 1980. Both films were produced by Haruki Kadokawa and featured extensive international casts and shooting locations. Although &quot;Proof of the Man&quot; was only released theatrically in Japan and &quot;Virus&quot; saw a financially unsuccessful truncated cut in the U.S., Kennedy was highly enthusiastic about his involvement.

In 1984, Kennedy starred with Bo Derek in the box-office bomb &quot;Bolero&quot;. His other films during the 1980s included &quot;Savage Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Delta Force&quot; and &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;. He played Captain Ed Hocken in all three entries of &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994) alongside Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley and O. J. Simpson.

In 1990, Kennedy appeared in the Korean film &quot;Mayumi&quot; directed by Shin Sang-ok. Despite featuring Kennedy, it saw no wide release outside of South Korea and was ultimately a box-office failure.

On television, Kennedy starred as Carter McKay in the TV series &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978–1991), appearing from 1988 to 1991. From the mid-to-late 1990s, he promoted &quot;BreathAsure&quot; antacid tablets in radio and television commercials. Around this time, he reprised his role as McKay in the television films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In the late 1970s, Kennedy also appeared as a celebrity guest on the game show &quot;Match Game&quot;.

In 1998, he voiced Brick Bazooka for the film &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;. He then made several independent films, before making a 2003 comeback to television in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, playing the character Albert Miller, the biological father to character Victor Newman. In 2005, he made a cameo in the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Knocking&quot;, playing the director of an ill-fated western.

Kennedy made his final film appearance in &quot;The Gambler&quot; (2014) as Ed, the dying grandfather of Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s Jim Bennett. His role lasts for less than two minutes during the film&#x27;s opening scene, wherein Ed (moments before his death) bequeaths the responsibilities of patriarch to a heartbroken Jim.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and children ===
Kennedy was married four times, to three women. In the 1940s, he married Dorothy Gillooly, who had served in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps. They were divorced in the 1950s; Dorothy returned to her hometown Buffalo, New York. In 1959, Kennedy married Norma Wurman, also known as Revel Wurman. The couple had two children. Kennedy and Norma divorced the first time in 1971, remarried in 1973, and divorced a second and final time in 1978. The same year, Kennedy married Joan McCarthy (née Castagna). They remained married until her death in September 2015. The couple adopted three children.

=== Interests ===
Kennedy was friends with James Stewart, and he provided the voiceover in a mini-tribute to Stewart on TCM. Kennedy was an aviator who enjoyed flying and owned a Cessna 210 and Beechcraft Bonanza. Following his experiences working for the Far East Network during WWII and professional involvement with &quot;Proof of the Man&quot; and &quot;Virus&quot;, Kennedy maintained a lifelong affinity for Japan and its culture.

=== Illness and death ===
Kennedy resided in Eagle, Idaho, at the time of his death. He died on the morning of February 28, 2016, of a heart ailment at an assisted-living facility in Middleton, Idaho, 10 days after his 91st birthday. He had a history of heart disease.

<text>The Universal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC) is a heavy ion linac based at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It can provide beams of accelerated ions of elements from hydrogen to uranium with energies of 2 to 11.4 MeV / u.

The main branch consists of two ion source terminals followed by a Radio Frequency Quadrupole and by an Interdigital linac IH linac accelerator resonating at 36 MHz up to the energy of 1.4 MeV/u. The main part then is operated by a classical linac of the Alvarez type which resonates at 108 MHz. Final energy adjustment can be performed in the last section consisting of a series of single-gap resonators. This solution was proposed for maximum flexibility in beam energy.
The UNILAC is used both to send beams of heavy ions to experiments and to load the SIS18 Heavy-Ion Synchrotron (Schwer-Ionen-Synchrotron) with high-energy ions.

Collisions between heavy-ion beams and stationary targets can be made to generate superheavy transactinide elements.
Experiments using beams from UNILAC in the past 20 years have produced elements 107 to 112.

<text>Birth order refers to the order a child is born in their family; first-born and second-born are examples. Birth order is often believed to have a profound and lasting effect on psychological development. This assertion has been repeatedly challenged. Recent research has consistently found that earlier born children score slightly higher on average on measures of intelligence, but has found zero, or almost zero, robust effect of birth order on personality. Nevertheless, the notion that birth-order significantly influences personality continues to have a strong presence in pop psychology and popular culture.

==Theory==
Alfred Adler (1870–1937), an Austrian psychiatrist, and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, was one of the first theorists to suggest that birth order influences personality. He argued that birth order can leave an indelible impression on an individual&#x27;s style of life, which is one&#x27;s habitual way of dealing with the tasks of friendship, love, and work. According to Adler, firstborns are &quot;dethroned&quot; when a second child comes along, and this loss of perceived privilege and primacy may have a lasting influence on them. Middle children may feel ignored or overlooked, causing them to develop the so-called middle child syndrome. Younger and only children may be pampered and spoiled, which was suggested to affect their later personalities. All of this assumes what Adler believed to be a typical family situation, e.g., a nuclear family living apart from the extended family, without the children being orphaned, with average spacing between births, without twins and other multiples, and with surviving children not having severe physical, intellectual, or psychiatric disabilities.

Since Adler&#x27;s time, the influence of birth order on the development of personality has become a controversial issue in psychology. Among the general public, it is widely believed that personality is strongly influenced by birth order, but many psychologists dispute this. One modern theory of personality states that the Big Five personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism represent most of the important elements of personality that can be measured. Contemporary empirical research shows that birth order does not influence the Big Five personality traits.

In his 1996 book &quot;Born to Rebel&quot;, Frank Sulloway suggested that birth order had powerful effects on the Big Five personality traits. He argued that firstborns were much more conscientious and socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns. However, critics such as Fred Townsend, Toni Falbo, and Judith Rich Harris, argue against Sulloway&#x27;s theories. A full issue of &quot;Politics and the Life Sciences&quot;, dated September, 2000 but not published until 2004 due to legal threats from Sulloway, contains carefully and rigorously researched criticisms of Sulloway&#x27;s theories and data. Subsequent large independent multi-cohort studies have revealed approximately zero effect of birth order on personality.

In their book &quot;Sibling Relationships: Their Nature and Significance across the Lifespan&quot;, Michael E. Lamb and Brian Sutton-Smith argue that as individuals continually adjust to competing demands of socialization agents and biological tendencies, any effects of birth order may be eliminated, reinforced, or altered by later experiences.

==Personality==
Claims about birth order effects on personality have received much attention in scientific research, with the National Academy of Sciences in the USA concluding that effects are zero or near zero. Such research is a challenge because of the difficulty of controlling all the variables that are statistically related to birth order. Family size, and a number of social and demographic variables are associated with birth order and serve as potential confounds. For example, large families are generally lower in socioeconomic status than small families. Hence third-born children are not only third in birth order, but they are also more likely to come from larger, poorer families than firstborn children. If third-born children have a particular trait, it may be due to birth order, or it may be due to family size, or to any number of other variables. Consequently, there are a large number of published studies on birth order that are confounded.

Literature reviews that have examined many studies and attempted to control for confounding variables tend to find minimal effects for birth order. Ernst and Angst reviewed all of the research published between 1946 and 1980. They also did their own study on a representative sample of 6,315 young men from Switzerland. They found no substantial effects of birth order and concluded that birth order research was a &quot;waste of time.&quot; More recent research analyzed data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects on the Big Five personality traits of extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Contrary to Sulloway&#x27;s predictions, they found no significant correlation between birth order and self-reported personality. There was, however, some tendency for people to perceive birth order effects when they were aware of the birth order of an individual.

Smaller studies have partially supported Sulloway&#x27;s claims. Paulhus and colleagues reported that first borns scored higher on conservatism, conscientiousness and achievement orientation, and later borns higher on rebelliousness, openness, and agreeableness. The authors argued that the effect emerges most clearly from studies within families. Results are weak at best, when individuals from different families are compared. The reason is that genetic effects are stronger than birth order effects. Recent studies also support the claim that only children are not markedly different from their peers with siblings. Scientists have found that they share many characteristics with firstborn children including being conscientious as well as parent-oriented.

In her review of the research, Judith Rich Harris suggests that birth order effects may exist within the context of the family of origin, but that they are not enduring aspects of personality. When people are with their parents and siblings, firstborns behave differently from laterborns, even during adulthood. However, most people don&#x27;t spend their adult lives in their childhood home. Harris provides evidence that the patterns of behavior acquired in the childhood home don&#x27;t affect the way people behave outside the home, even during childhood. Harris concludes that birth order effects keep turning up because people keep looking for them, and keep analyzing and reanalyzing their data until they find them.

==Intelligence==
In a metanalysis, Polit and Falbo (1988) found that firstborns, only children, and children with one sibling all score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings. 

Robert Zajonc argued for a &quot;confluence&quot; model in which the lack of siblings experienced by firstborns exposes them to the more intellectual adult family environment. This predicts similar increases in IQ for siblings who next-oldest sibling is at least five years senior. These children are considered to be &quot;functional firstborns&quot;. The theory further predicts that firstborns will be more intelligent than only children, because the latter will not benefit from the &quot;tutor effect&quot; (i.e. teaching younger siblings).

Several studies have found that firstborns have slightly higher IQ than later borns. Such data is, however, commonly confounded with family size, which is in turn correlated with IQ confounds, such as social status. Likewise, an analysis of data from the National Child Development Study has been used in support of an alternate &quot;admixture hypothesis&quot;, which asserts that the apparent birth-order effect on intelligence is wholly an artifact of family size, i.e. an instance of selection pressure acing against intelligence under modern conditions.

The claim that firstborns have higher IQ scores to begin with, has, however, also been disputed outright. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth show no relationship between birth order and intelligence.

==Sexual orientation==
The fraternal birth order effect is the name given to the theory that the more older brothers a man has, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual orientation. The fraternal birth order effect is said to be the strongest known predictor of sexual orientation, with each older brother increasing a man&#x27;s odds of being gay by approximately 33%. (One of the largest studies to date, however, suggests a smaller effect, of 15% higher odds.) Even so, the fraternal birth order effect only accounts for a maximum of one seventh of the prevalence of homosexuality in men. There seems to be no effect on sexual orientation in women, and no effect of the number of older sisters.

In &quot;Homosexuality, Birth Order, and Evolution: Toward an Equilibrium Reproductive Economics of Homosexuality&quot;, Edward M. Miller suggests that the birth order effect on homosexuality may be a by-product of an evolved mechanism that shifts personality away from heterosexuality in laterborn sons. According to Miller, this would have the consequence of reducing the probability of these sons engaging in unproductive competition with each other. Evolution may have favored biological mechanisms prompting human parents to exert &quot;affirmative&quot; pressure &quot;toward&quot; heterosexual behavior in earlier-born children: As more children in a family survive infancy and early childhood, the continued existence of the parents&#x27; gene line becomes more assured (&quot;cf.&quot; the pressure on newly-wed European aristocrats, especially young brides, to produce &quot;an heir and a spare&quot;), and the benefits of encouraging heterosexuality weigh less strongly against the risk of psychological damage that a strongly heteronormative environment poses to a child predisposed toward homosexuality.

More recently, this birth order effect on sexuality in males has been attributed to a very specific biological occurrence. As the mother gives birth to more sons, she is thought to develop an immunity to certain male-specific antigens. This immunity then leads to an effect in the brain that has to do with sexual preference. Yet this biological effect is seen only in right-handed males. If not right-handed, the number of older brothers has been found to have no prediction on the sexuality of a younger brother. This has led researchers to consider if the genes for sexuality and handedness are somehow related.

Not all studies, including some with large, nationally representative samples, have been able to replicate the fraternal birth order effect. Some did not find any statistically significant difference in the sibling composition of gay and straight men; this includes the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the largest U.S. study with relevant data on the subject. Furthermore, at least one study, on the familial correlates of joining a same-sex union or marriage in a sample of two million people in Denmark, found that the only sibling correlate of joining a same-sex union among men was having older sisters, not older brothers.

== Traditional naming of children according to their birth order ==
In some of the world&#x27;s cultures, birth order is so important that each child within the family is named according to the order in which the child was born. For example, in the Aboriginal Australian Barngarla language, there are nine male birth order names and nine female birth order names, as following:

:Male: &quot;Biri&quot; (1st), &quot;Warri&quot; (2nd), &quot;Gooni&quot; (3rd), &quot;Mooni&quot; (4th), &quot;Mari&quot; (5th), &quot;Yari&quot; (6th), &quot;Mili&quot; (7th), &quot;Wanggooyoo&quot; (8th) and &quot;Ngalai&quot; (9th). 
:Female: &quot;Gardanya&quot; (1st), &quot;Wayooroo&quot; (2nd), &quot;Goonda&quot; (3rd), &quot;Moonaga&quot; (4th), &quot;Maroogoo&quot; (5th), &quot;Yaranda&quot; (6th), &quot;Milaga&quot; (7th), &quot;Wanggoordoo&quot; (8th) and &quot;Ngalaga&quot; (9th).

To determine the suitable name for the newborn child, one first finds out the number of the newborn within the family, and only then chooses the male/female name, according to the gender of the newborn. So, for example, if a baby girl is born after three boys, her name would be &quot;Moonaga&quot; (4th born, female) as she is the fourth child within the family.

In some modern day Western cultures, it is common for parents to give their children the same name as them. This tradition dates back to the 17th century and is most prevalent in fathers and sons, where the son will receive the same first name, middle name, and surname with either a &quot;Jr.&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot; or &quot;IV&quot;, etc. attached after the family surname. This practice started as a symbol of status for &#x27;upper class&#x27; citizens, but is now more commonly used as a family tradition, not necessarily implying that they are of a &#x27;higher status&#x27; than their peer(s), sibling(s) or other family members.

The tradition of a father naming his son after himself or a male relative from an earlier generation (grandfather, great-grandfather) is referred to as &#x27;patronymic&#x27;, while the tradition of a mother naming her daughter after herself or a female relative from an earlier generation (grandmother, great-grandmother) is referred to as &#x27;matronymic&#x27;.

<text>Simon Boerum (February 29, 1724 – July 11, 1775) was a farmer, miller, and political leader from Brooklyn, New York. He represented New York in the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775. He signed the Continental Association. 

Boerum&#x27;s family settled on Long Island when it was a part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. His parents were William Jacob Boerum (1687–1766) and Rachel (Bloom) Boerum (1690–1738), who farmed in the town of New Lots, in Kings County, New York, which is now part of Brooklyn. Simon was born there on February 29, 1724, and was baptized in the Dutch Reformed Church on March 8. He attended and graduated from the Dutch school in Flatbush. Boerum farmed and operated a mill in Flatbush. In 1748, he bought a home and garden at what is today the southwest corner of Fulton and Hoyt streets in downtown Brooklyn. On April 30, 1748, he married Maria Schenck (1726–1771), and the house became their home for the rest of their lives.

In 1750, Governor George Clinton appointed Boerum as county clerk for Kings County. He would hold that office for the rest of his life, as well as a seat in the Province of New York Assembly after 1761. In 1774, the Assembly could not reach agreement about the Continental Congress. Kings County selected him to represent them, and on October 1, 1774, the Congress added him to the New York delegation. In the Congress, he supported the non-importation agreement and the more radical members in general. He helped to defeat the Galloway Plan for union and reconciliation with England.

Early in 1775, the Colony&#x27;s Assembly rejected the work of the first Congress and was hurriedly adjourned to prevent further measures from consideration. In April, Boerum was elected to the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress. That body in turn named him once again to the Continental Congress, but illness soon forced his return from Philadelphia. Simon died at home on July 11, 1775, and was originally buried in the Dutch Burying Ground in New Lots. In 1848, he and his wife, Maria, were re-interred in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<doc id="614552" wikidata="Q6437548" url="?curid=614552" title="Krishnan Guru-Murthy">
<text>Krishnan Guru-Murthy (born 5 April 1970) is a British journalist. He is the lead presenter of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. He also presents &quot;Unreported World&quot;, a foreign-affairs documentary series.

==Early life==

Guru-Murthy&#x27;s father, an Indian consultant radiologist, worked in Blackburn and Burnley. The family lived in Liverpool, then moved to a &quot;gothic folly&quot; in a village outside Burnley. Guru-Murthy attended the then-private Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School in Blackburn, before studying philosophy, politics and economics at Hertford College, Oxford.

== Career ==

Guru-Murthy&#x27;s career began in 1988 with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;DEF II&quot; discussion programme &quot;Open to Question&quot; and the youth current-affairs programme &quot;Reportage&quot;. While at Oxford University he presented BBC2&#x27;s Asian current-affairs programmes &quot;East&quot; and &quot;Network East&quot;. He presented and reported for children&#x27;s news programme &quot;Newsround&quot; from 1991 to 1994. He worked as a producer and reporter for &quot;Newsnight&quot; for three years, and was one of the launch presenters for BBC News 24 in 1997.

=== Channel 4 ===
Guru-Murthy joined &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; in 1998 and is the programme&#x27;s second-longest-serving presenter, behind Jon Snow. He was also the main presenter of &quot;Channel 4 News at Noon&quot; between 2003 and 2009. The Royal Television Society Journalism Awards nominated him for its News Presenter of the Year award in 2010 and 2014.

He has hosted Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of ceremonies at the 2012 Paralympics, 2014 Winter Paralympics and the reburial of Richard III. He presented &quot;The TV Show&quot; and &quot;The Operation: Surgery Live.&quot; He has hosted &quot;The Event – How Racist are You?&quot;, &quot;The Autopsy&quot;, &quot;The Exorcism,&quot; the quiz show &quot;Number One&quot; and two series of &quot;Going Cold Turkey.&quot;

Guru-Murthy moderated &quot;Ask the Chancellors,&quot; the first debate between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his counterparts in the 2010 General Election. He also hosted &quot;How to save £100 Billion – Live&quot; the night before the new government&#x27;s Emergency Budget.

Guru-Murthy became Channel 4&#x27;s ambassador for its foreign affairs programme &quot;Unreported World&quot; in 2011 and has made documentaries in Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Iraq, South Africa, and Yemen.

On 19 October 2022, Guru-Murthy was suspended for a week by Channel 4 after calling Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker a &quot;cunt&quot; in an off-air remark. Guru-Murthy later apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; to Baker. Channel 4 said it has a strict code of conduct for employees and &quot;takes any breaches seriously&quot;.

==== Notable interviews ====
Guru-Murthy&#x27;s February 2010 interview with Jim Devine became key evidence when the former Labour MP was prosecuted for expenses fraud. The politician was sentenced to sixteen months in jail.

In January 2013, Quentin Tarantino refused to answer Guru-Murthy&#x27;s question if there was a link between film violence and real-life violence. The film director&#x27;s responses included: &quot;I&#x27;m not doing this, I&#x27;m not taking the bait&quot;; &quot;I refuse your question. I&#x27;m not your slave and you&#x27;re not my master. You can&#x27;t make me dance to your tune. I&#x27;m not a monkey&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s none of your damn business what I think about that!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m shutting your butt down.&quot;

Guru-Murthy described his October 2014 interview with Richard Ayoade as &quot;the perfect joke interview&quot;. Ayoade&#x27;s increasingly blunt responses had reduced Guru-Murthy&#x27;s colleague Jon Snow to fits of laughter off-screen.

In April 2015, whilst promoting the film &quot;&quot;, Robert Downey Jr. walked out of an interview with Guru-Murthy after the journalist asked about the actor&#x27;s relationship with his father, drug use, and alcoholism. The interview has been watched several million times on YouTube. Guru-Murthy said the question areas had been discussed in advance with Downey&#x27;s public relations agent and Downey was in the wrong since Channel 4 does not do &quot;promotional interviews&quot;.

=== Other news media ===
Guru-Murthy presented a weekly radio programme on LBC 97.3 between 2003 and 2005; hosted &quot;UK Leaders Live&quot;, interviewing the three main political party leaders in the UK&#x27;s 2005 election; and presented the series &quot;Hindu Lives&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in 2005. He used to write a column in the &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper and the Asian newspaper &quot;Eastern Eye&quot;.

=== Other film and television ===
He has appeared on Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The F Word&quot; TV show with his brother and mother as contestants. 

In 2001, Guru-Murthy presented the short-lived Channel 4 game show &quot;Number One&quot;.

Guru-Murthy has appeared in a comic documentary about the band Gorillaz, as a guest on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Taskmaster,&quot; and in cameo appearances for &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Dead Set&quot;.

In August 2023, Guru-Murthy was announced as a contestant on the twenty-first series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer Lauren Oakley; they were the seventh couple to be eliminated.

==Volunteer work==

Guru-Murthy is a trustee of Duchenne UK. He founded the Duchenne Dash, a 24-hour cycle ride from London to Paris, in 2013. He was also appointed to the board of trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 2018, and was reappointed for the role in 2021.

==Personal life==
Guru-Murthy is married and has two children. His sister is BBC News journalist Geeta Guru-Murthy. His brother Ravi Guru-Murthy was formerly Chief Innovation Officer of the International Rescue Committee and is currently Chief Executive of Nesta.

Guru-Murthy suffers from Crohn&#x27;s disease and a genetic heart condition. He has played in a rock band with Peter Barron and the chief creative officer of Endemol UK. He is a supporter of Liverpool F.C.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet George Clinton (c. 1686 – 10 July 1761) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. Benefiting from the patronage of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, he served as a naval captain during the 1720s and 1730s.

Clinton went on to be Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland, Commodore and Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and then Governor of the Province of New York where he had to deal with the threat of a French attack during King George&#x27;s War. He could not cope with the liberal politicians of the New York assembly who were led by James De Lancey and resigned in 1753.

Clinton also served as Member of Parliament for Saltash, a rotten borough in Cornwall, from March 1757 until his death in July 1761.

==Early career==

Born the second son of Francis Clinton, 6th Earl of Lincoln, and Susan Clinton (née Penninston), Clinton joined the Royal Navy in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Clinton enjoyed the patronage of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who was his sister-in-law&#x27;s brother, and, having been promoted to captain on 16 June 1716, he was given command of the fifth-rate . He transferred to the command of the fourth-rate in 1720 and served in the Baltic Sea under Admiral Sir John Norris: the ship was lost during the return journey to England, but Clinton was acquitted at the subsequent court-martial. He was given command of the fourth-rate in 1721 and sailed to the Baltic Sea to carry out patrols before returning home again in 1722.

After four years of inactivity, Clinton was given command of the fourth-rate in the Mediterranean Sea in 1726 and saw action escorting merchant shipping, attacking Spanish batteries and blockading the Spanish coast before transferred to the command of the fourth-rate in July 1727. In 1732, Clinton was appointed commodore of a squadron of ships which was despatched to Newfoundland where he also became governor of the colony. In that role he supervised the newly appointed local magistrates and protected the local fishing industry.

Clinton took command of the second-rate as flag captain to Admiral Sir Charles Wager in June 1732 and then transferred to the command of the third-rate in the Channel Fleet in 1734. He went on to be Commodore and Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1736 but, with the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear looming, he stepped down to take command of the third-rate in 1739 and of the second-rate in 1740 during the War of the Austrian Succession.

==Governor of New York==
Heavily in debt, Clinton lobbied the Duke of Newcastle for profitable employment as an American governor: he was appointed Governor of the Province of New York in July 1741 and arrived in New York in September 1743 to take up his position. Promoted to rear-admiral on 10 December 1743 and vice-admiral on 23 June 1744, he sought to protect New York&#x27;s northern border from attack by the French: however liberal members of the New York assembly resisted his proposals as they wanted to maintain trade links with the French and with the Native Americans who were under French influence.

James De Lancey, who had initially been his main adviser, turned against him and sought to block the governor&#x27;s salary. Clinton therefore invited Sir William Johnson to take over responsibility for Native American affairs in 1746 and appointed Cadwallader Colden to be his advisor. Clinton was promoted to full admiral on 15 July 1747. Working with the Mohawk chief Hendrick Theyanoguin, Johnson was able to recruit Mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the British in 1747 during King George&#x27;s War. After continuing disputes with the assembly over military expenditure and payment of the governor&#x27;s salary, Clinton resigned as governor in October 1753.

==Later career==
Clinton was elected member of parliament for Saltash, a rotten borough in Cornwall, in May 1754. Promoted to Admiral of the Fleet in March 1757, he died on 10 July 1761.

==Family==
Clinton married the heiress, Anne Carle on 19 December 1727, at St James, Westminster, London: their children included General Sir Henry Clinton, who became a British commander in the American Revolutionary War, and Lucy Mary Clinton, who married Admiral Robert Roddam.

Clinton was &quot;a distant relative&quot; of Charles Clinton, patriarch of a line of Clintons later prominent in New York. George Clinton, as Governor of the Province of New York, politically patronized Charles Clinton and Charles Clinton&#x27;s eponymous son George Clinton, who would later become the first Governor of the State of New York and Vice President of the United States. Another son of Charles Clinton was James Clinton; both James and George served as Revolutionary War generals under George Washington opposite their distant cousin Sir Henry Clinton.

<doc id="614566" wikidata="Q51127" url="?curid=614566" title="Carl Theodor Dreyer">
<text>Carl Theodor Dreyer (; 3 February 1889 – 20 March 1968), commonly known as Carl Th. Dreyer, was a Danish film director and screenwriter. Widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers in history, his movies are noted for emotional austerity and slow, stately pacing, frequent themes of social intolerance, the inseparability of fate and death, and the power of evil in earthly life.

His 1928 movie &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, renowned for its cinematography and use of close-ups. It frequently appears on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;&#x27;s lists of the great films ever made, and in 2012&#x27;s poll, it was voted the ninth-best film by film critics and 37th by film directors.

His other well-known films include &quot;Michael&quot; (1924), &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1932), &quot;Day of Wrath&quot; (1943), &quot;Ordet&quot; (&quot;The Word&quot;) (1955), and &quot;Gertrud&quot; (1964).

==Life==
Dreyer was born illegitimate in Copenhagen, Denmark. His birth mother was an unmarried, Scanian maid named Josefine Bernhardine Nilsson, and he was put up for adoption by his birth father, Jens Christian Torp, a married Danish farmer living in Sweden who was his mother&#x27;s employer. He spent the first two years of his life in orphanages until his adoption by a typographer named Carl Theodor Dreyer and his wife Inger Marie (née Olsen). He was named after his adoptive father, but in accordance with Danish practice, there is no Senior or Junior added to their names to distinguish them from each other.

His adoptive parents were emotionally distant, and his childhood was largely unhappy. He later recalled that his parents &quot;constantly let me know that I should be grateful for the food I was given and that I strictly had no claim on anything since my mother got out of paying by lying down to die.&quot; He was a highly intelligent school student, who left home and formal education at the age of 16. He dissociated himself from his adoptive family, but their teachings influenced the themes of many of his films.

Dreyer was ideologically conservative. David Bordwell stated &quot;As a youth he belonged to the Social Liberal party, a conservative group radical only in their opposition to military expenditures.&quot; Dreyer recalled &quot;Even when I was with &quot;Ekstrabladet&quot;, I was conservative...I don&#x27;t believe in revolutions. They have, as a rule, the tedious quality of pulling development back. I believe more in evolution, in the small advances.&quot;

Dreyer died of pneumonia in Copenhagen at age 79. The documentary &quot;Carl Th. Dreyer: My Metier&quot; contains reminiscences from people who knew him.

==Career==

=== Early works ===

As a young man, Dreyer worked as a journalist, and he eventually joined the film industry as a writer of title cards for silent films and subsequently of screenplays. He was initially hired by Nordisk Film in 1913.

His first attempts at film direction had limited success, and he left Denmark to work in the French film industry. While living in France he met Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, and other members of the French artistic scene.

In 1928 he made his first classic film, &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;. Working from the transcripts of Joan of Arc&#x27;s trial, he created a masterpiece of emotion that drew equally on realism and expressionism. Because the Danish film industry was in financial ruin, Dreyer depended on private financing from Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg to make his next film, &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1932), a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in this story of a man protecting two sisters from a vampire. Both films were box office failures, and Dreyer did not make another movie until World War II.

=== Later career ===
By 1943, Denmark was under Nazi occupation, and Dreyer&#x27;s film &quot;Day of Wrath&quot; had as its theme the paranoia surrounding witch hunts in the seventeenth century in a strongly theocratic culture. With this work, Dreyer established the style that would mark his sound films: careful compositions, stark monochrome cinematography, and very long takes.

Dreyer made two documentaries in the more than a decade before his next full-length feature film, in 1955, &quot;Ordet&quot; (&quot;The Word&quot;), based on the play of the same name by Kaj Munk. The film combines a love story with a conflict of faith.

Dreyer&#x27;s last film was 1964&#x27;s &quot;Gertrud&quot;. Although seen by some as a lesser film than its predecessors, it is a fitting close to Dreyer&#x27;s career as it deals with a woman who, through the tribulations of her life, never expresses regret for her choices. David Thomson says it &quot;awaits rediscovery as Dreyer&#x27;s finest film and vindication of his method.&quot; Thomson quotes Dreyer:

The great, never finished project of Dreyer&#x27;s career was a film about Jesus. Although a manuscript was written (published in 1968), the unstable economic conditions and Dreyer&#x27;s own perfectionism left the project undeveloped at his death.

<doc id="614571" wikidata="Q929683" url="?curid=614571" title="Brooks &amp; Dunn">
<text>Brooks &amp; Dunn is an American country music duo consisting of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, both of whom are vocalists and songwriters. The duo was founded in 1988 through the suggestion of songwriter and record producer Tim DuBois. Before their formation, both members were solo recording artists, having charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s. Brooks also released an album for Capitol Records in 1989 and wrote hit singles for other artists.

The duo signed to Arista Nashville after their foundation. They have recorded eleven studio albums, one Christmas album, and five compilation albums for the label. They also have released 50 singles, of which 20 went to number one on the Hot Country Songs charts and 19 more reached top 10. Two of these number-one songs, &quot;My Maria&quot; (a cover of the B.W. Stevenson song) and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing &#x27;bout You&quot;, were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End charts. The latter is also the duo&#x27;s longest-lasting number-one single on that chart at six weeks. Several of their songs have also reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the number-25 peaks of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing &#x27;bout You&quot; and &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot; being their highest there. Brooks and Dunn also won the Country Music Association Vocal Duo of the Year award every year between 1992 and 2006, except for 2000. Brooks and Dunn won the award again in 2024. Two of their songs won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal: &quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; in 1994 and &quot;My Maria&quot; in 1996. All but two of the duo&#x27;s studio albums are certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America; their highest-certified is their 1991 debut album, &quot;Brand New Man&quot;, which is certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million copies.

The duo&#x27;s material is known for containing influences of honky-tonk, mainstream country, and rock, as well as the contrast between their singing voices and on-stage personalities, although some of their music has also been criticized as formulaic. Their 1992 single &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot; helped repopularize line dancing in the United States, and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Only in America&quot; was used by both George W. Bush and Barack Obama in their respective presidential campaigns. Brooks and Dunn have collaborated with several artists, including Reba McEntire, Vince Gill, Sheryl Crow, Mac Powell, Billy Gibbons, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Luke Combs.

After announcing their retirement in August 2009, they performed their final concert on September 2, 2010, at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Brooks and Dunn have continued to record for Arista Nashville as solo artists. Dunn released a self-titled album in 2011, which included the top-10 country hit &quot;Bleed Red&quot;, while Brooks released &quot;New to This Town&quot; in September 2012. The duo reunited in 2015 for a series of concerts with Reba McEntire in Las Vegas. In 2019, the duo was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==History==

===Kix Brooks===
Leon Eric &quot;Kix&quot; Brooks III was born on May 12, 1955, in Shreveport, Louisiana, and before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1976, he played at various venues in Maine. He was also a neighbor of country singer Johnny Horton. Brooks worked as a songwriter in the 1980s, co-writing the number-one singles &quot;I&#x27;m Only in It for the Love&quot; by John Conlee, &quot;Modern Day Romance&quot; by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Lonely Now&quot; by Highway 101, plus The Oak Ridge Boys&#x27; Top 20 hit &quot;You Made a Rock of a Rolling Stone&quot;, Nicolette Larson&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Be the First&quot;, and Keith Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Me in the Briarpatch&quot;. Brooks also released several singles through the independent Avion label, charting at No. 73 on Hot Country Songs in 1983 with &quot;Baby, When Your Heart Breaks Down&quot;. In 1989, he released a self-titled studio album through Capitol Records. This album included &quot;Baby, When Your Heart Breaks Down&quot; and &quot;Sacred Ground&quot;, which McBride &amp; the Ride covered and took to No. 2 on the country charts in 1992. Brooks and Pam Tillis co-wrote and sang on &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, a multi-artist single released on Warner Bros. Records in 1990 in honor of Earth Day. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote &quot;Backbone Job&quot;, a Keith Whitley outtake that appeared on his 1991 compilation album, &quot;Kentucky Bluebird&quot;.

===Ronnie Dunn===
Ronnie Gene Dunn was born on June 1, 1953, in Coleman, Texas. He played bass guitar in local bands during high school, and he briefly studied theology at Hardin-Simmons University with the intention of becoming a Baptist preacher. Dunn was &quot;kicked out&quot; of the school because he played in bars. Between 1983 and 1984, he recorded for the Churchill label, taking both &quot;It&#x27;s Written All Over Your Face&quot; and &quot;She Put the Sad in All His Songs&quot; to number 59 on the country charts. In 1989, session drummer Jamie Oldaker entered Dunn in a talent contest sponsored by Marlboro, which he won. The grand prize in the competition included a recording session in Nashville, Tennessee. The producer of that session, Scott Hendricks, recommended Dunn&#x27;s recordings to Tim DuBois, then an executive of Arista Nashville. DuBois paired Brooks and Dunn because he thought that they would work well together as songwriters, and after the two recorded a demo, he suggested that they form a duo. During this timespan, Dunn also wrote &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot;, which Asleep at the Wheel recorded on their 1990 album, &quot;Keepin&#x27; Me Up Nights&quot;.

==Musical career==
===&quot;Brand New Man&quot;===
Brooks and Dunn&#x27;s first single, &quot;Brand New Man&quot;, entered the Hot Country Songs charts in June 1991 and went to number one. It was the title track to the duo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Brand New Man&quot;, which was released two months later. Brooks and Dunn wrote this song and several other cuts in collaboration with songwriter Don Cook, who co-produced the album with Hendricks. It was also Cook&#x27;s first credit as a producer. The next three single releases from &quot;Brand New Man&quot; (&quot;My Next Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Neon Moon&quot;, and their own rendition of &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot;) all made number one on the country music charts, as well, making for the first time in country-music history that a duo or group had sent its first four singles to the top of the charts. A fifth single, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, peaked at number six. &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot;, which had previously been the B-side to &quot;My Next Broken Heart&quot;, also made number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and its commercial success led to a renewed interest in line dancing throughout the United States. &quot;Brand New Man&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 1992 for shipments of one million copies; by 2002, the album had been certified sextuple-platinum for shipments of six million. It spent more than 190 weeks on the Top Country Albums charts. In 1992, the duo won the Duo of the Year Award from the Country Music Association, which also nominated them for that year&#x27;s Album of the Year and Horizon awards. Brooks and Dunn won the association&#x27;s Duo award for every year from then until 2006, except for 2000, when the award went to Montgomery Gentry. After the album&#x27;s release, Brooks &amp; Dunn began touring as well.

&quot;Brand New Man&quot; received a positive review from AllMusic, whose critic Daniel Gioffre thought that the album showed the duo&#x27;s diversity of musical influences. Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was less positive, criticizing the duo&#x27;s sound for being &quot;imitative&quot;.

===&quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; and &quot;Waitin&#x27; on Sundown&quot;===
&quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; was the title of Brooks and Dunn&#x27;s second album, which was released in 1993. The title track, also its first single, peaked at number four on the country music charts. The album included two number-one singles in its third and fifth releases: &quot;She Used to Be Mine&quot; and its B-side, &quot;That Ain&#x27;t No Way to Go&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ll Burn That Bridge&quot; and &quot;Rock My World (Little Country Girl)&quot; (respectively the second and fourth releases) both made top five on &quot;Billboard&quot;, with the former reaching number one on &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. Also included on the album was a remix of &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; won the duo a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and the album was nominated for Best Country Album. &quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot; earned its highest RIAA certification in 2002, when it was certified quintuple platinum. Brian Mansfield gave a generally positive review in Allmusic, saying that its up-tempo songs &quot;rocked harder&quot; than any of the songs from the first album.

By the end of 1994, the duo released their third studio album, &quot;Waitin&#x27; on Sundown&quot;. It also produced five charting singles, three of which made number one on the country charts: &quot;She&#x27;s Not the Cheatin&#x27; Kind&quot;, &quot;Little Miss Honky Tonk&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;. The other two singles, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forgive My Heart&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Under the Bridge&quot;, both made top 10. Allmusic critic Thom Owens thought that the album&#x27;s singles were &quot;solid&quot;, but that the rest of the songs were &quot;filler&quot;. A review of the single &quot;She&#x27;s Not the Cheatin&#x27; Kind&quot; from the same site praised it for its &quot;hard-driving, honky-tonk spirit&quot;. Nash praised the honky-tonk sound of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forgive My Heart&quot;, but thought that most of the other songs relied on &quot;contrivance&quot;. Randy Lewis of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; gave a generally positive review, saying that the &quot;minidrama&quot; of &quot;A Few Good Rides Away&quot; (which Brooks co-wrote) was the strongest track on the album.

===&quot;Borderline&quot;===
The first single from Brooks and Dunn&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Borderline&quot;, was a cover version of B.W. Stevenson&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;My Maria&quot;. Their version of the song spent three weeks at number one in mid-1996 and peaked at number 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it was also that year&#x27;s top country song according to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End charts. Dunn said that he was initially reluctant to record &quot;My Maria&quot; because the duo had not previously recorded any cover songs. The song won Brooks and Dunn its second Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Group or Duo, and the duo won the 1996 Entertainer of the Year award from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, making them the first duo to win that award from the former. In 1997, Brooks &amp; Dunn joined a double-headliner tour with Reba McEntire. &quot;Borderline&quot; produced another number one in &quot;A Man This Lonely&quot;, along with the top-10 hits &quot;I Am That Man&quot; and &quot;Why Would I Say Goodbye&quot;. &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Get Dressed Up for Nothing&quot;, the third single and B-side to &quot;My Maria&quot;, became their first release not to make the top 10.

Michael McCall of Allmusic and Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; both thought that the album&#x27;s material was &quot;cliché&quot; and that &quot;My Maria&quot; was the strongest song on it. A more positive review came from Larry Stephens of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot;, who thought that the album had &quot;the right mix&quot; of songs.

===&quot;The Greatest Hits Collection&quot; and &quot;If You See Her&quot;===
Their first greatest hits compilation was released on September 16, 1997. It comprised most of their singles to that point and three new songs: &quot;Honky Tonk Truth&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Got You&quot;, and &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. The first two were released as singles, with respective peaks of three and two on the country charts. &quot;The Greatest Hits Collection&quot; was certified platinum in April 1998, and double-platinum in 2001.
Brooks &amp; Dunn collaborated with Reba McEntire to perform &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot;, which was the lead-off single to Brooks and Dunn&#x27;s &quot;If You See Her&quot; and McEntire&#x27;s &quot;If You See Him&quot;, both of which were released on the same day. Arista Nashville and MCA Nashville, the label to which McEntire was signed, both promoted the single. This cut went to number one, as did &quot;If You See Her&quot;&#x27;s next two singles: &quot;How Long Gone&quot; and a cover of Roger Miller&#x27;s &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, which also became the duo&#x27;s first top-40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Dunn recorded the vocals for &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; in one take. Also included on the album was a cover of Mark Collie&#x27;s &quot;Born and Raised in Black and White&quot;, the first song of the duo&#x27;s career in which they alternated on lead vocals. The album&#x27;s fourth single was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Over You&quot;, which was a top-five country hit. Following it was &quot;South of Santa Fe&quot;, which peaked at number 41 on the country charts, thus becoming the duo&#x27;s lowest-peaking single there. In 2001, &quot;If You See Her&quot; reached double-platinum certification in the United States.

Jana Pendragon, in her review for Allmusic, praised Dunn&#x27;s vocal performances on &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Angel&quot;, but thought that a couple of the other cuts were &quot;formula&quot;. &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; writer Kevin Oliver criticized the album for having &quot;wildly uneven&quot; material, calling the McEntire collaboration a &quot;snoozer&quot; and &quot;South of Santa Fe&quot; &quot;wretched&quot;.

===&quot;Tight Rope&quot;===
&quot;Tight Rope&quot; (1999), the duo&#x27;s sixth album, was also its least commercially successful release. It included three singles: a cover of John Waite&#x27;s &quot;Missing You&quot;, followed by &quot;Beer Thirty&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Be Loved By Me&quot;. The former two failed to make top 10, while the latter peaked at number five in 2000. Dunn co-wrote some songs on this album with McBride &amp; the Ride lead singer and bassist Terry McBride (who would later join Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x27;s road band), and Brooks collaborated with Bob DiPiero. The duo shared production duties with Byron Gallimore on all three singles and four other songs on the album, while retaining Cook as producer on the other six. While &quot;Beer Thirty&quot; was climbing, the album cut &quot;Goin&#x27; Under Gettin&#x27; Over You&quot; charted as high as number 60 based on unsolicited airplay. &quot;Tight Rope&quot; was certified gold for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, but did not receive any higher certification. Likely due to its performance, the duo has not featured any material from this album on their compilations.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave this album a mixed review, referring to the &quot;Missing You&quot; cover as a &quot;misstep&quot;. Jon Weisberger thought that the album was &quot;consistent&quot; but added that it did not have any &quot;surprises&quot;. Brooks revealed in 2015 that the album&#x27;s poor performance almost led to the duo splitting up, as he felt, &quot;We weren&#x27;t really writing together anymore, and we were just kind of done&quot;, but they ultimately stayed together at the suggestion of Joe Galante, then the head of their label.

===&quot;Steers &amp; Stripes&quot;===
In addition to persuading the duo to stay together, Galante suggested that they record the song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing &#x27;Bout You&quot;, because he felt it had potential as a hit. The song served as the lead single from their seventh album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Steers &amp; Stripes&quot;. It became their longest-lasting number one, with a six-week stay at that position. This song was the second song of the duo&#x27;s career to be named the top single of the year according to &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End; it was also their highest peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at the time, peaking at number 25 there. For this album, the duo worked with producer Mark Wright, who also produced for Lee Ann Womack and Gary Allan at the time.

The next two singles from &quot;Steers &amp; Stripes&quot; both made number one, as well: &quot;Only in America&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, the latter of which was written by Irish pop singers Ronan Keating and Paul Brady. After it, the duo charted at number five with &quot;My Heart Is Lost to You&quot; and number 12 with a cover of Kim Richey&#x27;s &quot;Every River&quot;, featuring a backing vocal from Richey. All of these other singles also made the pop charts. &quot;Only in America&quot; was later used by George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election campaign, and again in 2008 by Barack Obama in his campaign. In 2023, Donald Trump took the stage at a campaign rally while the lyric &quot;One could end up going to prison&quot; from &quot;Only in America&quot; played. Trump was facing multiple criminal charges at the time. Noting that the song was used by both a Republican and a Democratic candidate, Brooks (who wrote the song with Cook and Ronnie Rogers) said that it was &quot;very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans&quot;.

This album was generally well received, with the reviews in Allmusic and &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; noting that the album was more consistent than the previous ones. Nash was less favorable, referring to the up-tempos as &quot;retreads&quot;, but praising Dunn&#x27;s voice.

===&quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Christmas Without You&quot; and &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot;===
Brooks and Dunn released their first Christmas album in 2002 titled &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Christmas Without You&quot;. Four of its cuts made the country music charts based on seasonal airplay: the title track, &quot;Hangin&#x27; &#x27;round the Mistletoe&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Little Christmas&quot;, and a rendition of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;. It was followed in early 2003 by the duo&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot;, whose title track became the duo&#x27;s 18th number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;. Two more singles were released from it: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl&quot;, which spent five weeks in the number-three position, and &quot;That&#x27;s What She Gets for Loving Me&quot; at number six. On the Hot 100, these songs respectively peaked at 25, 39, and 53. As with &quot;Steers &amp; Stripes&quot;, &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot; was certified platinum.

Erlewine described &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot; as a concept album in his review of it, saying that its title track and other songs offered a &quot;tribute to their roots and upbringing&quot;. Nash gave the album an A-minus rating, saying that Brooks &amp; Dunn &quot;dig even deeper&quot; on the album; she also referred to the title track as a &quot;gutsy account of the terrible beauty of coming of age&quot;. A less favorable review came from &quot;Country Standard Time&quot;, whose critic Jeffrey B. Remz called it &quot;satisfactory, but not much more&quot;. Both Nash and Remz compared &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl&quot; to the sound of The Rolling Stones.

===&quot;The Greatest Hits Collection II&quot; and &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;===
Arista Nashville released Brooks and Dunn&#x27;s second greatest-hits package, &quot;The Greatest Hits Collection II&quot;, in October 2004. The album included singles from &quot;If You See Her&quot;, &quot;Steers and Stripes&quot;, &quot;Red Dirt Road&quot;, and the previously unreleased &quot;That&#x27;s What It&#x27;s All About&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Better All the Time&quot;. Respectively, these cuts peaked at numbers two and one on the country-music charts, as well as 38 and 56 on the Hot 100. It excludes material from &quot;Tight Rope&quot;.

In August 2005, the duo released the single &quot;Play Something Country&quot;. According to Dunn and co-writer Terry McBride, it was inspired by Gretchen Wilson, who was touring with Brooks and Dunn and Big &amp; Rich on the Deuces Wild tour at the time. &quot;Play Something Country&quot; was the lead-off to their ninth studio album, &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot;. Brooks &amp; Dunn co-produced it with Tony Brown, with further production from Mark Wright on &quot;My Heart&#x27;s Not a Hotel&quot;. A month after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Play Something Country&quot; became the duo&#x27;s twentieth and final number one on Hot Country Songs, and went to number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Believe&quot;, peaked at number eight, also winning the next year&#x27;s Single of the Year and Song of the Year awards from the Country Music Association. After it was &quot;Building Bridges&quot;, with guest vocals from Vince Gill and Sheryl Crow, which peaked at number four. Before the duo released this song, it had been released by co-writer Larry Willoughby, a cousin of country singer Rodney Crowell, and later by Nicolette Larson. The final release from &quot;Hillbilly Deluxe&quot; was the title track, which peaked at number 16 on Hot Country Songs. Erlewine gave this album a positive review, saying that it was not &quot;quite as ambitious&quot; as the previous two albums, but &quot;just as satisfying&quot;.

Brooks and Dunn began their Long Haul tour in mid-2006, which featured Sugarland and Jack Ingram as opening acts. Of this tour, Brooks said, &quot;They&#x27;ve got a lot of shows under their belt, they&#x27;re really good at what they do, and they are great performers[…]We want everything about this show from opening act &#x27;til the lights go down to be first class.&quot;

===&quot;Cowboy Town&quot;===

Their 10th studio album, &quot;Cowboy Town&quot;, was released on October 2, 2007. Its lead-off single &quot;Proud of the House We Built&quot; reached number four on the country charts and 57 on the Hot 100. Following this song were &quot;God Must Be Busy&quot; at number 11 and &quot;Put a Girl in It&quot; at number three. After this song, the duo released &quot;Cowgirls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, which they later performed with Reba McEntire at the Country Music Association awards. Following this performance, the song was re-released partway through its chart run with McEntire dubbed into the final chorus. In early 2009, the song peaked at number two on the country charts. Although not released as a single, the title track spent three weeks on the charts and peaked at number 56. Also included on the album is a collaboration with Jerry Jeff Walker on &quot;The Ballad of Jerry Jeff Walker&quot;. Cowboy Town was also the name of the duo&#x27;s 2009 tour, which featured Rodney Atkins and ZZ Top. The tour began on June 6 at the BamaJam festival in Enterprise, Alabama.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;Brooks &amp; Dunn have crafted these songs[…]with an eye on the middle of the road, and they do it well enough that this music will likely win them that audience yet again.&quot; Mikael Wood of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it &quot;B+&quot;, saying that &quot;even if the themes on their 11th studio CD are a bit predictable, their muscular riffs and handsome vocal harmonies give the material a boot-scooting vibrancy&quot;.

===Retirement, solo careers, reunion, and &quot;Reboot&quot;===
On August 10, 2009, Brooks and Dunn announced that they would be splitting up after a tour titled The Last Rodeo. According to Brooks, the decision to split was on good terms; he told CMT that Dunn and he are &quot;still good friends&quot;, while Dunn said, &quot;We&#x27;ve ended up more like brothers.&quot; The duo released its final compilation, &quot;#1s… and Then Some&quot;, on September 8 of the same year. The album features 28 past hits and two new songs, but again skipping material from &quot;Tight Rope&quot;. Both of these new songs, &quot;Indian Summer&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Stomp&quot; (featuring guest vocals from Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top), peaked at number 16 on the country-music charts. On May 23, 2010, CBS aired a tribute show presented by the Academy of Country Music titled &quot;The Last Rodeo&quot;, on which various country music stars performed Brooks &amp; Dunn songs while the duo received a Milestone Award. The academy donated proceeds from the concert to help victims of the 2010 Tennessee floods. Brooks and Dunn performed their last concert together at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on September 2, 2010, with proceeds from the concert benefiting the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Both members stayed with Arista Nashville as solo artists after the split. Dunn released his self-titled solo album in June 2011, which produced the top 40 country hits &quot;Bleed Red&quot;, &quot;Cost of Livin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Let the Cowboy Rock&quot;. Dunn announced via Facebook on June 7, 2012, that he had exited Arista Nashville. Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel reissued the album in late May with two bonus tracks; proceeds from the reissue benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. In late 2013, Dunn sang duet vocals with Kelly Clarkson on a cover of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; from her Christmas album &quot;Wrapped in Red&quot;. Dunn&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Peace, Love, and Country Music&quot;, was released in 2014, followed by &quot;Tattooed Heart&quot; in 2016 on Valory Music Group&#x27;s Nash Icon label. The latter features Brooks on the single &quot;Damn Drunk&quot;. Brooks released the solo single &quot;New to This Town&quot;, which features Joe Walsh on slide guitar. Brooks&#x27; first Arista album, also titled &quot;New to This Town&quot;, was released in September 2012.

On December 3, 2014, Brooks &amp; Dunn were announced to be reuniting to perform a series of concerts in Las Vegas with Reba McEntire in mid to late 2015. In 2016, they were selected as some of the 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track featuring the artists performing a medley of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, which was released in celebration of 50 years of the CMA Awards.

In February 2019, the duo announced a new album called &quot;Reboot&quot;, which features re-recordings of their previous singles with guest vocals from contemporary country-music artists. In advance of the album&#x27;s release, they issued two of their tracks - a version of &quot;Brand New Man&quot; with Luke Combs, and &quot;Believe&quot; featuring Kane Brown. In addition, Brooks and Dunn announced a concert in Dallas, alongside their Las Vegas residency, as well as a March 2019 appearance at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. &quot;Reboot&quot; was released on April 5, 2019.

In 2019, the duo featured in season 16 of &quot;The Voice&quot; as battle advisors as a part of Team Blake.

Brooks &amp; Dunn announced a sequel album to &quot;Reboot&quot; in 2024, titled &quot;Reboot II&quot;. It includes re-recordings of their previous hit singles with other country music artists such as Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, and Megan Moroney. Unlike the previous project, it also includes collaborations with rock band Halestorm and blues singer Marcus King. The album was released on November 15, 2024.

=== Other works ===

Brooks and Dunn have also contributed to several soundtracks and compilation albums. In 1994, they recorded &quot;Ride &#x27;em High, Ride &#x27;em Low&quot; for the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;8 Seconds&quot;, and a cover of &quot;Corrine, Corrina&quot; in collaboration with Asleep at the Wheel for a tribute album to Bob Wills. Both of these cuts peaked at number 73 on the country charts, while &quot;Rock My World&quot; was climbing. In early September 1994, the duo collaborated with Johnny Cash on a rendition of his song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; for the album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot;, a charity album made by the Red Hot Organization to benefit AIDS awareness. Also that year, they covered &quot;Best of My Love&quot; on the Eagles tribute album &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot;. They covered Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Against the Wind&quot; for the soundtrack to the cartoon &quot;King of the Hill&quot;; this rendition charted at number 55 in late 1999 based on unsolicited airplay. They also recorded &quot;Keep On Swinging&quot;, which Brooks wrote with Five for Fighting, for the soundtrack to the 2006 animated film &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Hero&quot;. Finally, they collaborated with Mac Powell on &quot;Over the Next Hill&quot; from the to the 2008 film &quot;&quot;, and took the song to number 55 on the country charts.

Dunn has sung guest vocals on other artists&#x27; songs, including Lee Roy Parnell&#x27;s mid-1994 cover of the Hank Williams song &quot;Take These Chains from My Heart&quot; (from Parnell&#x27;s album &quot;On the Road&quot;), &quot;Try Me&quot; on Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Jasper County&quot;, &quot;Raise the Barn&quot; on Keith Urban&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Love, Pain &amp; the Whole Crazy Thing&quot;, and Ashley Monroe&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To&quot;, which reached number 37 on the country charts. He also sang duet vocals with Carlene Carter on a cover of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash&#x27;s &quot;Jackson&quot; for the 2007 tribute album &quot;Anchored in Love: A Tribute to June Carter Cash&quot;. In 2011, he covered Gary Stewart&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Actin&#x27; Single (I&#x27;m Drinkin&#x27; Doubles)&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Country Strong&quot;, and contributed duet vocals to Cledus T. Judd&#x27;s parody of &quot;God Must Be Busy&quot;, titled &quot;Garth Must Be Busy&quot;.

Dunn and Dean Dillon co-wrote Shenandoah&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Darned If I Don&#x27;t (Danged If I Do)&quot; and the track &quot;She Wants Me to Stay&quot; on David Kersh&#x27;s debut album &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave&quot; on Toby Keith&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Shock&#x27;n Y&#x27;all&quot; with Keith, and Reba McEntire&#x27;s 2010 single &quot;I Keep On Loving You&quot; with Terry McBride. Brooks &amp; Dunn co-wrote &quot;Steady as She Goes&quot; on Wade Hayes&#x27; debut album &quot;Old Enough to Know Better&quot; and &quot;Our Time Is Coming&quot; (originally an album cut from &quot;Hard Workin&#x27; Man&quot;) on his second album &quot;On a Good Night&quot;, while Dunn co-produced his 2001 album &quot;Highways &amp; Heartaches&quot;.

In January 2006, Brooks succeeded Bob Kingsley as the host of the radio countdown show &quot;American Country Countdown&quot;, while Kingsley moved to his own show, &quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot;. Brooks received an Academy of Country Music nomination for National On-Air Radio Personality in 2010, and again in 2011. Later that same year, he made his acting debut in an independent film called &quot;Thriftstore Cowboy&quot;. In 2011, he starred in a second film, &quot;The Last Ride&quot;.

== Musical style and artistry ==
Steve Huey of Allmusic contrasts Brooks&#x27; and Dunn&#x27;s voices, saying that Dunn &quot;was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played the part of the high-energy showman&quot;. He also describes their sound as &quot;a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [alternated with] smooth, pop-tinged ballads&quot;. In the book &quot;The New Generation of County Music Stars&quot;, David Dicaire describes Dunn as &quot;possess[ing] a soulful voice with a quiet intensity&quot; and a &quot;traditional country singer&quot;, while calling Brooks &quot;the opposite to Dunn&#x27;s musical personality&quot;, &quot;a high-energy showman&quot; and &quot;the perfect accompaniment to his partner&quot;. Brooks sang lead on &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, &quot;Rock My World&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Get Dressed Up for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Why Would I Say Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;South of Santa Fe&quot;.

Michael McCall of &quot;New Country&quot; magazine attributed Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x27;s success in the 1990s to a rise of upstart duos throughout the early-mid 1990s, as very few two-person acts in country music existed after the breakup of the Judds in 1991. He noted that in 1993, the Academy of Country Music had only four acts instead of five in the Vocal Duo of the Year category, and two of the four nominees were not signed to a record label at the time. By 1994, McCall stated that several more duos had been formed in response, mostly consisting of male songwriters, such as Turner Nichols, Archer/Park, and Orrall &amp; Wright. McCall also thought the renewed interest in duos helped to draw newfound attention to the few existing duos who had lost popularity after the beginning of the 1990s, such as the Bellamy Brothers and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2015, Brooks received the inaugural CMA Foundation &quot;Humanitarian Award&quot; as a reflection of his dedication to organizations such as Monroe Carell Jr. Children&#x27;s Hospital at Vanderbilt, The Monroe Harding Children&#x27;s Home, and the CMA Foundation. He was pivotal in the creation of the &quot;Keep The Music Playing&quot; program which is funded from proceeds of the CMA Music Fest. The campaign has provided more than $11M into Tennessee schools for music education since 2006.
For several years, Dunn&#x27;s annual &quot;Rock The Barn&quot; event at his home near Nashville raised money for charities such as Gilda&#x27;s Club and the St. Thomas Breast Cancer Center.

==Slim &amp; Howdy==
In the liner notes to each of their studio albums, Brooks &amp; Dunn wrote short stories about Slim &amp; Howdy, fictionalized cowboy versions of themselves. The duo worked with Bill Fitzhugh in late 2008 to write a book titled &quot;The Adventures of Slim and Howdy&quot;.

<text>Puromycin is an antibiotic protein synthesis inhibitor which causes premature chain termination during translation.

== Inhibition of translation ==

Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic, derived from the &quot;Streptomyces alboniger&quot; bacterium, that causes premature chain termination during translation taking place in the ribosome. Part of the molecule resembles the 3&#x27; end of the aminoacylated tRNA. It enters the A site and transfers to the growing chain, causing the formation of a puromycylated nascent chain and premature chain release. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time but the 3&#x27; position contains an amide linkage instead of the normal ester linkage of tRNA. That makes the molecule much more resistant to hydrolysis and stops the ribosome.

Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes.

Also of note, puromycin is critical in mRNA display. In this reaction, a puromycin molecule is chemically attached to the end of an mRNA template, which is then translated into protein. The puromycin can then form a covalent link to the growing peptide chain allowing the mRNA to be physically linked to its translational product.

Antibodies that recognize puromycylated nascent chains can also be used to purify newly synthesized polypeptides and to visualize the distribution of actively translating ribosomes by immunofluorescence.

== Peptidase Inhibitor ==
Puromycin is a reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl-peptidase II (serine peptidase) and cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase (metallopeptidase). The mechanism of inhibition is not well understood, however puromycin can be used to distinguish between aminopeptidase M (active) and cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase (inhibited by puromycin).

== Cell culture ==
Puromycin is used in cell biology as a selective agent in cell culture systems. It is toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Resistance to puromycin is conferred by the &quot;pac&quot; gene encoding a puromycin &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-transferase (PAC) that was found in a Streptomyces producer strain. Puromycin is soluble in water (50 mg/mL) as colorless solution at 10 mg/mL. Puromycin is stable for one year as solution when stored at -20 °C. The recommended dose as a selection agent in cell cultures is within a range of 1-10 μg/mL, although it can be toxic to eukaryotic cells at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL. Puromycin acts quickly and can kill more than 99% of nonresistant cells within one day.

== Selection of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; ==

Puromycin is poorly active on &quot;E. coli&quot;. Puromycin-resistant transformants are selected in LB agar medium supplemented with 125 μg/mL of puromycin. But use of puromycin for &quot;E. coli&quot; selection requires precise pH adjustment and also depends on which strain is selected. For hassle–free selection and optimum results the use of specially modified puromycin is possible. Plates containing puromycin are stable for 1 month when stored at 4 °C.

== Selection of yeast ==

Puromycin resistance in yeast can also be conferred through expression of the puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (&quot;pac&quot;) gene. Lethal concentrations of puromycin are much higher for strains of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; than mammalian cell lines. Deletion of the gene encoding the multidrug efflux pump Pdr5 sensitizes cells to puromycin.

== Memory loss in mice ==
Long-term synaptic plasticity, such as is required for memory processes, requires morphological changes at protein level. As puromycin inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, researchers were able to show that injections of this drug will result in both short-term as well as long-term memory loss in mice.

<text>The University of Greifswald (; ), formerly known as &quot;Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald&quot;, is a public research university located in Greifswald, Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

Founded in 1456, it is one of the oldest universities in Europe, with generations of notable alumni and staff having studied or worked in Greifswald. As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648–1815) and Prussia (1815–1945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179 students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world.

The University of Greifswald was founded on 17 October 1456 with the approval of the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope. This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald&#x27;s lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university&#x27;s first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas&#x27; Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.

In the late Middle Ages the University of Greifswald was one of the most important centers of science in the Duchy of Pomerania. The rest of Pomeranian schools – including those in Szczecin and Stargard – did not have the university status in this time. Nowadays in Germany, there are only three older universities by count of the years of existence: the University of Heidelberg (established 1386), the University of Leipzig (1409), and the University of Rostock (1419).

International co-operation with other institutions of higher education in northern Europe existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network Hanse. From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from Scandinavia. This was a relatively high percentage compared to the total number of students at the time. Sources suggest a relatively segregated life of Swedish students in the primarily German university though.
The early sixteenth century saw significant co-operation of the university, the Lutheran church, the city and the Duchy of Pomerania. Professors of theology simultaneously served as pastors in the three cathedrals. Professors of medicine usually served as personal physicians of the duke. Professors of law were also working at the local courts while professors of the faculty of philosophy usually taught the sons and daughters of the ducal family. The landed nobility also funded university-related purposes such as scholarships and student bursaries.

The Reformation was introduced at the university in 1539. Johannes Bugenhagen, an alumnus of the university, was an important figure during the German and Scandinavian reformation as well as a good friend of Martin Luther. After the secularisation of the monastery at Eldena near Greifswald, Duke Philipp I of Pomerania gave all revenue created by the now secularised &quot;Amt Eldena&quot; to the university. His successor, Duke Ernst Ludwig, began the construction of a college building, which could only be completed after his death. Duke Philipp Julius presented the university a gown that was used by the rector on ceremonial occasions up until very recently.

=== 1600–1815: Sweden ===
In 1604, the Greifswald University Library became the first centralised university library in Germany. The university signed a contract with a book printer from Wittenberg, Germany, for the amount of 2,000 Gulden. This contract lasted nearly a century due to the disruption caused by the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). Hence, the university now owns prestigious early prints of authors and printers such as Johannes Gutenberg or Thomas Thorild. The phrase &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; as applied to the outcome of the Protestant Reformation is attributed to the early seventeenth century jurist Joachim Stephani (1544–1623) of the University of Greifswald.

The Duke of Pomerania was in financial troubles and had not paid the professors. As a solution, he gave the Amt Eldena to the university – a total of 140 square kilometres of land.

After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, became a fief held by Sweden. From 1806 to 1815 it was formally a part of Sweden. Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815. Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden. More than 1,500 Swedes studied at Greifswald University.

The first university course in the English language in Germany was held in Greifswald in the year 1777.

The main administrative building – still in use today – was built during the &quot;good old Swedish years&quot; by Andreas Mayer, a mathematician by profession, in the style of North German Baroque.

=== 1815–1933: Prussia ===

When Swedish Pomerania became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, the University of Greifswald became the oldest university on Prussian territory. Prussia recognised the potential of science and universities, thus extensive building activity and growing financial support enabled the University of Greifswald to grow further both in size and reputation.

In 1856, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university&#x27;s founding, a monument was unveiled in the presence of King Frederick William IV of Prussia. The monument is still at its place, and was carefully restored for the 550th anniversary in 2006.

The Faculty of Law became &quot;Faculty of Law and Economics&quot; when an economic department was introduced in 1905. In 1912, Otto Jaekel, a professor of paleontology in Greifswald, founded the German Paleontological Society. The &quot;Department of Modern Languages&quot; was established in 1853. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university in 1856, the &quot;Rubenow-Denkmal&quot; (Rubenow Memorial) was built in front of the main building, which is still there at its historic place. The &quot;Department of History&quot; was founded in 1863 as the first in Prussia and the fourth in all of Germany. The painter Caspar David Friedrich was born in Greifswald and received his first painting instruction by one of the university&#x27;s members. Today the &quot;Department of Fine Art and Art History&quot; is named after him. He later painted several oil paintings with motifs from the region, including the one on the left.

The spectrum of academic research and teaching was further expanded during the Weimar Republic. The Nordisches Institut (Scandinavian and Finno-Ugric studies) and several other research institutes, e.g. for biological research, Christian archeology, and Palestinian studies, were founded.

=== 1933–1945: Nazi Germany ===

In 1933 the university was named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, who was a student of theology in 1791 and later taught history at Greifswald. Here, he published his works &quot;&quot;Versuch einer Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft in Pommern und Rügen&quot;, &quot;Germanien und Europa&quot; as well as the first part of &quot;Geist der Zeit&quot;. The name was suggested by SA and Nazi Party member professor Walther Glawe. The university was gleichgeschalted and reformed according to military needs of the Nazis.

=== 1945–1990: GDR ===
All academic activities came to a halt towards the end of the Second World War, and the university was re-opened on 15 February 1946. The name of Ernst Moritz Arndt was initially removed but restored in 1954. Several organisational changes were made during the time of the GDR, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the German Reunification.

=== 1990–present: Germany ===
Freedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established. The Faculty of Law and Economics was re-opened from 1991 to 1993. Extensive renovation took place since 1990. The dinosaur Emausaurus was named after the acronym of the university (&quot;E&quot;rnst-&quot;M&quot;oritz-&quot;A&quot;rndt-&quot;U&quot;niversität Greifswald) in 1990.

Beginning in 1999, the University of Greifswald was among the first in Germany to welcome and introduce the international Bachelor/Master degree system as proposed by the Bologna declaration. The new system has replaced all former 4½-year &quot;Magister&quot; degrees in the arts and humanities and is set to replace the 4½-year &quot;Diplom&quot; formerly awarded in the sciences and in business too.

In 2006, the university celebrated its 550th anniversary with a large variety of events. The central ceremony – involving the re-opening of the university&#x27;s renovated administrative building by President Horst Köhler of Germany, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and Minister President Harald Ringstorff of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern – took place on 17 October 2006.

Since the end of the GDR the University of Greifswald has undergone major construction efforts. Between 1991 and 2007, more than 417 million euros were spent on the careful renovation of historic buildings, as well as on the construction of new sites. For instance, 19th century lecture hall (&quot;auditorium maximum&quot;) has been carefully restored, just like the university&#x27;s main administrative building and many other buildings in the historic center of town. A new campus for natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city. The new domiciles of Greifswald University Library, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed. The university hospital, which is thought to be completed in 2009, will be the most up-to-date full-scale hospital in Germany, adding to the appeal of the Greifswald Medical School. As a consequence of the construction of the new Greifswald University Hospital building, all historic 19th and early 20th century buildings that were formerly used by the hospital will be transferred to house other disciplines, thus creating an old-town campus for such departments as law and economics, the humanities and social sciences, and improving research and teaching considerably. As one of only 17 out of a total of 52 proposed building projects of &quot;national significance&quot; across Germany, the national government has agreed to subsidise the construction of a new pharmacology research lab (in Germany, education is usually cared for by the German states and not by the national government, which only supports a few projects of national and international importance).

Founded in 2000, the Alfried-Krupp Kolleg promotes the Universities international relations by awarding fellowships to Junior and Senior Fellows.

Following debates about the appropriateness of having the university named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, in January 2017 the Senate voted to remove his name from the official name of the university. Although the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern declared this decision void, a compromise was reached in which Arndt&#x27;s name is removed from the official name, but can still be used under certain circumstances. As of June 2018 the name &quot;Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universität Greifswald&quot; is no longer in use.

== Organisation ==
=== Central governance ===
The Rectorate, consisting of the rector, three pro-rectors, and the registrar, represents the university as a whole, sets the main guidelines development, distributes the finances, opens and closes study programmes, and appoints professors. The registrar is the head of the university administration, and manages the university&#x27;s budget. The rector is elected by the Senate for a four-year term, the registrar for an eight-year term, and the three pro-rectors are elected to serve for two years.

The Senate is the second governing institution of the university. The Senate elects the Rectorate, and is itself elected by the members of the university, i.e. by students and members of staff. Senators serve for two years, student senators for one year. The Senate consists of academic staff members (divided into professors and non-professors), students, and non-academic staff members (librarians, administration officials, etc.).

Moreover, there is a University Council (&quot;Universitätsrat&quot;), consisting of six prominent members of the public who are elected by the Senate to advise the university in various ways.

The Student&#x27;s Union (AStA) and the Student Parliament (StuPa) represent the interests of the students.

=== Faculties ===
The buildings of the arts and humanities, law, business studies, and theology are scattered about the historic centre of the town of Greifswald. The newly built facilities for the natural sciences, mathematics, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry are situated to the east of the city centre, offering first-class research opportunities. Like many European universities, the University of Greifswald has five faculties (German: &quot;&quot;) which are structured into departments, institutes, and chairs.

==== Arts and Humanities====
*Sacred Music and Music
* Fine Art
* German
* History
* Modern Languages (including English, Baltic Languages, Scandinavian Languages and Slavic Languages)
* Philosophy
* Political and Communication Science
*Education

==== Law and Economics ====
:Due to an education reform from 2013 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Law can only be taught at the University of Greifswald. The Faculty of Law in Rostock had to be closed. 
:Undergraduate degree courses offered at the Faculty of Law and Economics include Business Administration, Law and Management and Law. Master students can enroll for courses such as Health Care Management and Business Administration.

==== University Medicine ====

The Medical Faculty at the University of Greifswald is among the best-ranked in Germany and the admission requirements are among the highest in Germany. Courses are offered in Human Medicine and Dentistry.

==== Mathematics and Natural Sciences ====
Courses are offered in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, geography, geology, Mathematics, IT, pharmacy, psychology and physics.

The physics department of the University of Greifswald, together with the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik and the Leibniz Institute of Plasma Research and Technology, is a major international research hub in the field of plasma physics, attempting to solve future energy problems with the research reactor Wendelstein 7-X.

Since 2007, the Department of Physics takes care of the construction of a space telescope called &quot;MuSTAnG&quot; (Muon Spaceweather Telescope for Anisotropies at Greifswald), which will be part of a worldwide network of telescopes in Japan, Brazil, Australia and Germany. The telescope will enable physicists and astrononomers at Greifswald University to forecast solar activity and has been co-funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt. In addition to MuSTAnG, the university owns an observatory, which is taken care of by a private initiative and open to the public.

Greifswald offers two multi-disciplinary approaches to environmental studies, called landscape ecology and environmental sciences bringing together different disciplines such as biology, geography, economics, law, and ethics.

The pharmacy department and the biotechnology department are also in the top group in Germany. The government-funded National Research Centre for Animal Disease on the Isle of Riems co-operates loosely with the university and is named &quot;Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut&quot; in honour of the university&#x27;s former member of staff, Friedrich Loeffler.

The University of Greifswald owns a field station on the German island of Hiddensee.

Scientists from the university names a species of freshwater snail, &quot;Opacuincola gretathunbergae,&quot; after the climate activist Greta Thunberg.

==== Theology ====
The faculty of theology was founded when the university was founded in 1456. Notable theologians have studied or worked here, for example Johannes Bugenhagen who was a close friend of Martin Luther.

=== Library ===

Greifswald University Library traces its roots back to the year 1456. In 1604, the first centralised university library in Germany was founded in Greifswald. Today, there are two main libraries, the Central University Library is situated on the Beitzplatz Campus and the Departmental Library can be found on the Loefflerstraße Campus. In addition to the main libraries, several departments and institutes have their own libraries (German: &quot;Fachbibliothek&quot;).

=== Academic year ===
As is customary in Germany, the academic year is divided into two semesters. The &quot;winter term&quot; (&quot;Wintersemester&quot;) lasts from October to March, and the &quot;summer term&quot; (&quot;Sommersemester&quot;) from April to September. During the winter term, teaching usually takes place from mid-October to the end of January – the remainder being reserved for exams and the writing of term papers. Teaching during the summer term lasts from mid-April to mid-July.

== Cooperation ==
Aside from teaching and research, one of major tasks of the university is cooperation with partners outside the actual university.

=== Research partners ===

The university&#x27;s research emphasis lies in the field of plasma physics, landscape ecology, medicine, biotechnology, the Middle Ages and the languages and cultures of countries bordering the Baltic Sea.
* Alfried Krupp Institute of Advanced Study (Krupp-Kolleg)
* Biotechnikum Greifswald
* Friedrich Loeffler Institute (National Research Institute of Animal Diseases), Riems Island (FLI)
* Leibniz Institute of Plasma Research and Technology (LIPT)
* Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics
* Nuclear fusion research reactor Wendelstein 7-X
* Diabetes Research Centre, Karlsburg (near Greifswald)
* Siemens Public Networks, Greifswald
* Technology Centre Vorpommern
* Technologiepark (under construction)

=== International cooperation ===
The University of Greifswald aims to extend and efficiently use its international contacts. The primary geographic focus of international collaboration is Northern Europe and Eastern Europe, which is due to the university&#x27;s research focus in this area. Partnerships with foreign universities to foster exchange of people (staff and students alike) and ideas is conducted in two different ways. Firstly, through official partnership agreements with foreign universities, which involves the entire university and most or all of her disciplines. Secondly, through contacts of professors, departments, and schools, which usually involves only one or few disciplines.

Student exchange from and to Greifswald is co-ordinated by the university&#x27;s international office (&quot;&quot;). The University of Greifswald has signed several official partnership agreements with other universities to foster international co-operation through faculty and student exchange and academic co-operation. In Northern Europe, the university has signed partnership agreements with universities in Denmark (Århus, Holbæk), Finland (Joensuu and Kuopio), and Sweden (Lund). In Eastern Europe, partnership agreements have been signed with universities in the Czech Republic (Brno), Estonia (Tartu), Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Vilnius, Klaipeda), Poland (Poznan, Szczecin), and Russia (Kaliningrad, Saint Petersburg). Exceptions are the University of Aberdeen as one of the ancient universities of Scotland, and the University of Padua in Italy. The university has also signed various cooperation agreements with universities outside of Europe, e.g. the University of South Australia, the University of Newcastle, Australia, Widener University in Pennsylvania, the University of Manitoba and the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), the National University of Singapore (humanities) or Berkeley (humanities) and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (United States).

In addition to official partnership agreements (see above) on the university level, there also numerous other channels of international contact on the level of chairs, departments or academic faculties, which often also include student exchange through the ERASMUS programme. Co-operation of this kind takes place with numerous prestigious universities, including those in Barcelona, Bergen, Gothenburg, Graz, Copenhagen, Lancaster, Oslo, Prague, Reykjavík, Stockholm, Southampton, Uppsala or Utrecht.

=== Public events ===
The university and its research partners regularly organise events for the general public, in the form of lecture series or public discussions. There is an annual &quot;children&#x27;s university&quot; week as well as a family university, in which current trends in research are presented in a more popular form. Every semester, the student union organises a &quot;24-hour lecture&quot;, in which university researchers, politicians, students and others present topics in short lectures starting at 6 pm on a Friday, and ending at 6 pm on the following Saturday.

=== Museums and university collections ===
Until post-World War II communist land reforms, the University of Greifswald was a large scale land owner and one of the wealthiest universities in Germany. It owned over 140 square kilometres of arable land, the revenue of which was the basis for its financial independence and wealth. Parts of the land that the university previously possessed have been given back to the university since the German reunification, but some claims are still pending in court. Today, the university again manages some of the land previously owned, including a large forest near Eldena that is open to the public, but the revenue is low compared to other sources of funding. The university-owned forest is administered by university foresters.

The former affluence of the university can still be seen in many historic buildings as well as a notable collection of art and other possessions. The university has some its artworks and possessions on display in museums across the country. Ernst Bogislaw von Croÿ donated the Croy Tapestry, a tapestry depicting the Reformation from 1554. The university also owns one of only four remaining 36-line Gutenberg Bibles from the year 1458. The university owns various paintings and other artworks as well as a great number of historic books, some of which are lent for exhibition to independent public museums. The University of Greifswald runs Greifswald Botanic Garden. It also has a few collections, some of which are open to visitors:

* Anatomical Collection (&quot;Anatomische Sammlung&quot;)
* Archeological Collection (&quot;Archäologische Studiensammlung&quot;); Christian Archeological Collection (&quot;Christlich-archäologische Sammlung&quot;)
* Botanical Garden (&quot;Botanischer Garten&quot;)
* Neonatological and Gynecological Collection (&quot;Geburtshilflich-gynäkologische Sammlung&quot;)
* State Geological Collection (&quot;Geologische Landessammlung&quot;)
* Graphic Collection (&quot;Graphische Sammlung&quot;)
* Gustav Dalman Collection (theology) (&quot;Gustav-Dalman-Sammlung&quot;)
* Herbarium
* Collection of Historic Maps (&quot;Historische Kartensammlung&quot;)
* History of Medicine Collection (&quot;Medizinhistorische Sammlung&quot;)
* Coin Collection (&quot;Münzsammlung&quot;)
* Pathological Collection (&quot;Pathologische Sammlung&quot;)
* Collection of Physics Appliances (&quot;Physikalische Gerätesammlung&quot;)
* Computer Collection (&quot;Rechentechnische Sammlung&quot;)
* Collection of Pre-historic Antiquities (&quot;Sammlung vorgeschichtlicher Altertümer&quot;)
* Zoological Museum (&quot;Zoologisches Museum&quot;)

== Statistics ==

=== Admission ===
The University of Greifswald is frequently described as one of the most popular universities for undergraduate admission in Germany, which is due to a very good study environment as well as a co-operative spirit between the teaching staff and students. Due to its small size, with only 10,179 students, the university is comparable to other small universities such as St Andrews or Yale.

=== Rankings ===

In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2024, the university is placed at 401–500th globally and 37–41st within the country.

Today, the continued efforts to regain academic leadership are mirrored in national top placements, e.g. in the 2009 &quot;Die Zeit&quot; university ranking, in several subjects including for instance biology (2009), medicine (2009), geography, law (2008) pharmacy, psychology, dentistry (2009), and business administration (2008).

=== Student body ===
In the autumn of 2009, there were 12,500 students enrolled in Greifswald, i.e. a quarter of the town&#x27;s total population of 53,000 were students. According to a 2008 study, Greifswald is Germany&#x27;s &#x27;youngest city&#x27;, having the highest percentage of households by people under 30 years of age. In 2008, 59.4 percent of all students were female, the remaining male. Two-thirds of the enrolled students in 2009 came to Greifswald from outside the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and 5.3 percent were foreign nationals.

== Student life ==
Greifswald is situated in close proximity to the sea (near the islands Rügen and Usedom), about 200 km to the north of Germany&#x27;s capital city, Berlin, and 100 km east of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&#x27;s largest city, Rostock. There are train connections, and high-speed autobahn links to Hamburg, Rostock, and Berlin.

The city of Greifswald has several museums, a theatre and a philharmonic orchestra as well as a breadth of sports clubs and societies. A medium-sized convention centre called &quot;Stadthalle Greifswald&quot; exists.

According to a 2009 study, 44% of all people in Greifswald use their bicycle for daily transport, which is the highest such rate in Germany.

=== Athletics ===
The university&#x27;s &quot;Hochschulsport&quot; (college sports) offers a wide range of opportunities to students who wish to do sports. Courses are available in nearly all disciplines, for instance aerobics, American football, football (soccer), dragon boat, fencing, handball, judo, karate, canoeing, lacrosse, rugby, surfing, diving, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis, volleyball or yoga. The regular local sports clubs are frequented by students, too.

Greifswald is situated near the sea and the area between isles of Rügen and Usedom is among the most picturesque and best sailing and yachting regions in the whole of Germany. It is renowned for its steady winds.

There are a number of sailing and yachting clubs that are frequented by staff and students alike. There are two Sailing Clubs especially for students, the Studentischer Regattaverein, founded in 2007, which offers its Members a wide Range of Sailing Boats to take part in Regattas like Star, J/24, OK Dinghy, Europe, Vaurien, H Dinghy and a Nacra 5.0. The other one, being the oldest Sailing Club in Greifswald, is the &quot;Akademischer Seglerverein&quot; (Academic Sailing Club).

There is a golf club called &quot;Hanseatischer Golfclub&quot; which is popular with university staff and students alike. It hosts the annual &quot;Moritz Golf Cup&quot;.

=== Activities ===

The student-run, not-for-profit clubs &quot;Mensaclub&quot;, &quot;Geographenkeller&quot;, &quot;Geologenkeller&quot;, &quot;Club 9&quot; and &quot;Kiste&quot; are very popular and provide an inexpensive way of going out and meeting other students. There are several movie clubs who regularly show movies in German, English or in other languages. Apart from the localities that are run by students, there is an abundance of different pubs, clubs and restaurants.

For those wishing to attend music events, there are a number of concerts (rock, pop, etc.) in local pubs and venues throughout the year, as well as the annual &quot;Bach Festival&quot; called &quot;Greifswalder Bachwoche&quot; and the philharmonic concerts, open air operas and concerts, operas, theatre performances, and ballet are offered by the Theater Vorpommern.

Popular destinations for water- and beach-related activities during the summer are the nearby spa towns on the isles of Rügen and Usedom, e.g. Binz, Sellin, Heringsdorf. The coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is one of the most popular summer tourist destinations in Germany.

There is also a small beach in Greifswald-Eldena. The &quot;Stadtpark&quot; (city park) is situated to the northeast of the city centre next to a small zoo. The &quot;Ryck&quot; river crosses the city, and is only a 2-minute walk from the central market square. There are old boats, a pedestrian bridge and a few bars at the riverbank, which is full of students in the summer.

People who enjoy being outdoors make use of the fact that three of Germany&#x27;s 14 national parks – Jasmund, Müritz and Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft – can be reached within one hour or less from Greifswald.

=== Housing ===
As is customary at German universities, students are generally required to arrange for their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however a large majority of students share private flats with a couple of other students (German: &quot;Wohngemeinschaft&quot;, abbreviated &quot;WG&quot;), or live in single apartments. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.
=== Societies ===
As in any other university town, there are groups and organisations of various colours, e.g. human rights groups, political or religious youth organisations, environmental protection groups, and the like. There is a local ESN chapter for international students. GrIStuF – Greifswald International Students Festival – brings together students from all over the world each summer to discuss, party and compete with each other.

The AStA and the student parliament (&quot;StuPa&quot;) work to represent the interests of all students towards the university and society as a whole.

The following music groups are open to faculty and students, e.g.
* chamber choir
* cathedral choir
* university big band
* university choir
* university symphonic orchestra

Nordischer Klang (&quot;Nordic Sound&quot;) – an international festival of Scandinavian and Nordic culture – takes place each year in Greifswald and is actively supported by students and members of staff. &quot;Nordischer Klang&quot; introduces the cultures of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to the German public and is the largest festival of Nordic culture outside of the Nordic countries. It comprises lectures, movies, theatre performances, live jazz music, fine art and literature.

PolenmARkT (&quot;PolandmARkeT&quot;) is a German-polish festival taking place every November in the Hanseatic city Greifswald. It was created in 1997 to connect Germany and Poland – mainly in cultural aspects. It is organized by the PolenmARkT e.V. (an association) and a pool of volunteers. It was supported by the Embassy of Poland, the city Greifswald, the University of Greifswald and its students. Looking back at a 14-year-long period of growth it is one of the most important cultural events in the Hanseatic city. The organiserrs managed to establish the event sustainable into Greifswald&#x27;s citizens interests.

There is a monthly student magazine called &quot;moritz-Magazin&quot;, which read by the majority of students and publishes stories not only about university politics but also about culture in general. A popular &quot;radio98eins&quot; local/regional radio station is operated mainly by students and presents independent music and local news. Students who wish to get experience in television may want to join &quot;moritzTV&quot; the student TV channel.

=== Fraternities ===

Greifswald has several different student fraternities and sororities, which are called &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; (the singular is &quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;). &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot; have a long tradition as most of them were founded in the 19th century, and they are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the United States. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear coloured caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, in order to &quot;shape their members for the challenges of life&quot;. In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany&#x27;s student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The political views of the fraternities are more or less conservative, but two of them (Rugia and Markomannia) have been linked to the far-right NPD.

== Notable people ==

The University of Greifswald is associated with several notable people, including both former students and faculty. For instance, 17th-century lawyer David Mevius,
two Nobel Prize laureates as well as two German chancellors have studied or worked in Greifswald.

Johannes Stark (1874–1957) received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 (see Nobel Prize Website) &quot;for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields&quot; during his time at the University of Greifswald. In 1939, Gerhard Domagk (1895–1964) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine (see Nobel Prize Website) &quot;for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil&quot;. The university was named in honor of its former student and faculty member, the writer, politician, and poet Ernst Moritz Arndt. Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire from 1871 to 1890 and the &quot;engineer&quot; of the Unification of Germany in 1871, had a connection to Greifswald when he studied at the agricultural college, as well as one of his successors, Prince Bernhard von Bülow, who was chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909.

Franz Seldte, a chemist by profession, worked as a German labour minister. Johannes Bugenhagen, who introduced the Reformation in much of Northern Germany and Scandinavia was a student at the University of Greifswald and Thomas Thorild, a Swedish poet spent parts of his life in Greifswald. Alfred Gomolka, Member of the European Parliament for the CDU, worked for the university as well as the mathematician Felix Hausdorff. Bernhard Windscheid is one of the fathers of present German civil law.

* &quot;If I look at the development of some of the universities [in the former eastern part] – for instance Greifswald, Dresden, and Jena – then we have achieved quite a lot.&quot; (&quot;German&quot;: Wenn ich mir die Entwicklung einiger Universitäten anschaue – etwa Greifswald, Dresden und Jena – dann sind wir da schon ein ganzes Stück weiter.) – Bundespräsident Johannes Rau on the development and education in the former GDR, 2004
* &quot;Strong and self-confident universities are fountains of fortitude for a whole region, a whole country even, just as everyone can see it happen here in Greifswald.&quot; (&quot;German&quot;: Starke, selbstbewusste Hochschulen sind Kraftquellen für eine ganze Region, ein ganzes Land. Hier in Greifswald lässt sich das sehr genau studieren.) – Bundespräsident Horst Köhler in 2006

<text>Fudge is a type of confection that is made by mixing sugar, butter and milk. It has its origins in the 19th century United States, and became popular in American women&#x27;s colleges in the late 19th century. Fudge can come in a variety of flavorings depending on the region or country it was made; popular flavors include fruit, nut, chocolate and caramel. Fudge is often bought as a gift from a gift shop in tourist areas and attractions.

== History ==
The term &quot;fudge&quot; is said to have originated in the 17th century from the verb &quot;fadge&quot; and means &quot;to fit together in a clumsy manner&quot;. During this period, &quot;fudge&quot; was used as an interjection by sailors to respond to nonsense or untruth.

Fudge as a confection gained traction in the United States during the late 19th century; recipes for fudge were printed in many periodicals and advertisements during the 1880s. Its inexpensive, unrefined qualities made it popular among people looking for an alternative that fell between expensive candies and the cheapest sweets. Specialized fudge shops began opening in tourist places such as Mackinac Island, Michigan, in 1887. The increase in fudge&#x27;s popularity was partly due to the accessibility of its production process: ordinary people were able to make it in their homes without any specialized equipment. In addition, the cost of refined white sugar had been decreasing at the time, cutting production costs.

=== Fudge at women&#x27;s colleges ===
Making fudge was a popular activity at women&#x27;s colleges, especially Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. In a letter written by Emelyn Battersby Hartridge, a student at Vassar, she recounts purchasing of a box of fudge for 40 cents a pound in 1886 in Baltimore, Maryland. Another student at Vassar College claimed to have introduced it there in 1888 by selling her own batch. The diary of student Elma Martin mentions making &quot;fudges&quot; in 1892. An 1893 letter from a Vassar College student Adelaide Mansfield describes &quot;fudges&quot; as containing sugar, fruit, chocolate, milk, and butter.

A recipe for &quot;Fudges at Vassar&quot; was printed in &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1895. Despite describing the confections as &quot;Vassar chocolates&quot;, the recipe given comprises sugar, milk, butter, and vanilla extract. Wellesley College and Smith College have their own versions of a fudge recipe dating from the late 19th or early 20th century.

== Production ==

=== Texture ===
In texture, fudge falls between fondant icing and hard caramels. In forming a fondant, it is not easy to keep all vibrations and seed crystals from causing rapid crystallization into large crystals. Consequently, milkfat and corn syrup are often added to prevent premature crystallization. Corn syrup contains glucose, fructose (monosaccharides), and maltose (disaccharide). These sugars interact with sucrose molecules, inhibiting crystal contact to prevent premature crystallization. The added milkfat also helps to prevent rapid crystallization.

Controlling the crystallization of the supersaturated sugar solution is the key to making smooth fudge. Initiating crystals before the desired time will result in fudge with fewer, larger sugar grains. The final texture would then be grainy, a quality that is normally indicative of lower quality fudge.

=== Cooling and later stages ===
It is the endpoint temperature that separates hard caramel from fudge. The higher the peak temperature, the more sugar is dissolved and the more water evaporates, resulting in a higher ratio of sugar to water. Before the availability of cheap and accurate thermometers, cooks would use the ice-water (or cold water) test to determine the saturation of the confection. Fudge is made at the &quot;soft ball&quot; stage, which varies by altitude and ambient humidity from to . Butter is then added to the mixture and the fudge is cooled and beaten until it is thick and small sugar crystals have formed. The warm fudge is sometimes poured onto a marble slab to be cooled and shaped.

==Varieties==
Fudge-making has evolved a variety of flavors and additives. The favored flavors vary by location: in the United States, chocolate is a default flavor, with peanut butter and maple as alternatives. When it is made from brown sugar, it is called &quot;penuche&quot; and is typically found in New England and the Southern States.

In the UK, rum-and-raisin, clotted cream and salted-caramel are popular flavours. Fudge shares similarities with tablet, a confection with similar ingredients but a grainy, brittle texture.

== Hot fudge ==
Hot fudge sauce is a chocolate product often used in the United States and Canada as a topping for ice cream in a heated form, particularly sundaes, parfaits and occasionally s&#x27;mores. The butter in typical fudge is replaced with heavy cream, resulting in a thick chocolate sauce that is pourable while hot and becomes denser as the sauce cools. Commercial hot fudge sauce syrups (flavored with either natural or artificial flavorings) are generally thinner and formulated to be usable at room temperature.
