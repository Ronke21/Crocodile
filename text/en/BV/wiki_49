<text>A dominant-party system, or one-party dominant system, is a political occurrence in which a single political party continuously dominates election results over running opposition groups or parties. Any ruling party staying in power for more than one consecutive term may be considered a &quot;dominant party&quot; (also referred to as a &quot;predominant&quot; or &quot;hegemonic&quot; party). Some dominant parties were called the &quot;natural governing party&quot;, given their length of time in power.

&quot;Dominant&quot; parties, and their domination of a state, develop out of one-sided electoral and party constellations within a multi-party system (particularly under presidential systems of governance), and as such differ from states under a &quot;one&quot;-party system, which are intricately organized around a specific party. Sometimes the term &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; one-party state&quot; is used to describe dominant-party systems which, unlike a one-party system, allows (at least nominally) democratic multiparty elections, but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning power, thus resembling a one-party state. Dominant-party systems differ from the political dynamics of other dominant multi-party constellations such as consociationalism, grand coalitions and two-party systems, which are characterized and sustained by narrow or balanced competition and cooperation.

In political literature, more than 130 dominant party systems between 1950 and 2017 were included in a list by A. A. Ostroverkhov. For example, in the post-Soviet states, researchers classify parties such as United Russia and Amanat (Kazakhstan) as dominant parties on the basis that these parties have long held the majority of seats in parliament (although they do not directly form the government or appoint officials to government positions). In Russian political science literature, such associations are often called &quot;parties of power&quot;.

It is believed that a system with a dominant party can be either authoritarian or democratic. However, since there is no consensus in the global political science community on a set of mandatory features of democracy (for example, there is a point of view according to which the absence of alternation of power is, in principle, incompatible with democratic norms), it is difficult to separate the two types of one-party dominance.

==Theory==
Dominant-party systems are commonly based on majority rule for proportional representation or majority boosting in semi-proportional representation. Plurality voting systems can result in large majorities for a party with a lower percentage of the vote than in proportional representation systems due to a fractured opposition (resulting in wasted votes and a lower number of parties entering the legislature) and gerrymandering.

Critics of the &quot;dominant party&quot; theory argue that it views the meaning of democracy as given, and that it assumes that only a particular conception of representative democracy (in which different parties alternate frequently in power) is valid. Raymond Suttner, himself a former leader in the African National Congress (ANC), argues that &quot;the dominant party &#x27;system&#x27; is deeply flawed as a mode of analysis and lacks explanatory capacity. But it is also a very conservative approach to politics. Its fundamental political assumptions are restricted to one form of democracy, namely electoral politics, and display hostility towards popular politics. This is manifest in the obsession with the quality of electoral opposition, and its sidelining or ignoring of popular political activity organised in other ways. The assumption in this approach is that other forms of organisation and opposition are of limited importance or a separate matter from the consolidation of their version of democracy.&quot;

One of the dangers of dominant parties is &quot;the tendency of dominant parties to conflate party and state and to appoint party officials to senior positions irrespective of their having the required qualities.&quot; However, in some countries this is common practice even when there is no dominant party. In contrast to one-party systems, dominant-party systems can occur within a context of a democratic system as well as an authoritarian one. In a one-party system other parties are banned, but in dominant-party systems other political parties are tolerated, and (in democratic dominant-party systems) operate without overt legal impediment, but do not have a realistic chance of winning; the dominant party genuinely wins the votes of the vast majority of voters every time (or, in authoritarian systems, claims to). Under authoritarian dominant-party systems, which may be referred to as &quot;electoralism&quot; or &quot;soft authoritarianism&quot;, opposition parties are legally allowed to operate, but are too weak or ineffective to seriously challenge power, perhaps through various forms of corruption, constitutional quirks that intentionally undermine the ability for an effective opposition to thrive, institutional and/or organizational conventions that support the status quo, occasional but not omnipresent political repression, or inherent cultural values averse to change.

In some states opposition parties are subject to varying degrees of official harassment and most often deal with restrictions on free speech (such as press laws), lawsuits against the opposition, and rules or electoral systems (such as gerrymandering of electoral districts) designed to put them at a disadvantage. In some cases outright electoral fraud keeps the opposition from power. However, some dominant-party systems occur, at least temporarily, in countries that are widely seen, both by their citizens and outside observers, to be textbook examples of democracy. An example of a genuine democratic dominant-party system would be the pre-Emergency India, which was almost universally viewed by all as being a democratic state, even though the only major national party at that time was the Indian National Congress. The reasons why a dominant-party system may form in such a country are often debated: supporters of the dominant party tend to argue that their party is simply doing a good job in government and the opposition continuously proposes unrealistic or unpopular changes, while supporters of the opposition tend to argue that the electoral system disfavors them (for example because it is based on the principle of first past the post), or that the dominant party receives a disproportionate amount of funding from various sources and is therefore able to mount more persuasive campaigns. In states with ethnic issues, one party may be seen as being the party for an ethnicity or race with the party for the majority ethnic, racial or religious group dominating, e.g., the African National Congress in South Africa (governing since the end of apartheid in 1994) has strong support amongst Bantu peoples of South Africa and the Ulster Unionist Party governed Northern Ireland from its creation in 1921 until 1972 with the support of the Protestant majority. Similarly, the Apartheid-era National Party in South Africa had the support of Afrikaners who make up the majority of White South Africans while English-speaking white South Africans tended towards more liberal and reform-oriented parties like the Progressive Federal Party.

Sub-national entities are often dominated by one party due to the area&#x27;s demographic being on one end of the spectrum or espousing a unique local identity. For example, the current elected government of the District of Columbia has been governed by Democrats since its creation in the 1970s, Bavaria by the Christian Social Union since 1957, Madeira by the Social Democrats since 1976, and Alberta by the Progressive Conservatives from 1971 to 2015. On the other hand, where the dominant party rules nationally on a genuinely democratic basis, the opposition may be strong in one or more subnational areas, possibly even constituting a dominant party locally; an example is South Africa, where although the African National Congress is dominant at the national level, the opposition Democratic Alliance is strong to dominant in the Province of Western Cape.

== Methods of dominant-party governments ==
In dominant-party governments, they use institutional channels, rather than repression, to influence the population. Coercive distribution can control citizens and economic elites through land reform, poverty alleviation, public health, housing, education, and employment programs. Further, they distribute private goods to the winning coalition (people who are necessary for its reign) in order to stay in power. Giving the winning coalition private goods also prevents civil conflict. They also use the education system to teach and uphold compliance. The recruiting, disciplining, and training of teachers allow for authoritarian governments to control teachers into following their objective: to foster compliance from the youth. Another way that they maintain control is through hosting elections. Even though they would not be fair elections, hosting them allows citizens to feel that they have some control and a political outlet. They can also enhance rule within their own state through international collaboration, by supporting and gaining the support, especially economic support, of other similar governments.

<text>Lazovsky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-two in Primorsky Krai, Russia. It is located in the southeast of the krai on the eastern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range and its southern spurs. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) of Lazo. Population: The population of Lazo accounts for 24.1% of the district&#x27;s total population.

==Geography==
24.8% of the district&#x27;s territory is occupied by the Lazovsky Nature Reserve, which was established between 1935-1957 and has an area of 121,000 ha (1,210km2). The main river in the district is the Kiyevka.

==History==
The district was split from Olginsky District on March 4, 1941 as Sokolovsky District, and was given its present name on August 26, 1949 after the administrative center was moved to Lazo from the settlement of Sudzukhe.

==Economy==
Most of the population is involved in the coastal and oceanic fishing, mariculture development, and fish and sea products processing. JSC &quot;Preobrazhenskaya Trawling Fleet Base&quot; and &quot;Valentin Fish Factory&quot; operate in the district.

Among the district&#x27;s mineral deposits are tin and gold deposits. The thermal mineral waters are of great importance. &quot;Chistovodnoye&quot;, the krai&#x27;s specialized hospital, where illness of locomotor apparatus and skin diseases are treated, is located on the radon springs. Two lakes with medical mud are also used.

===Transportation===
No railways operate on the territory of the district. Communication with the outer world is by auto and sea transport.

<text>Viscount (August 23, 1847 – February 12, 1889) was a Meiji period Japanese statesman, diplomat, and founder of Japan&#x27;s modern educational system. Mori Arinori served as the first Minister of Education in the first Ito Cabinet of Japan, playing a key role in establishing the educational system during the Empire of Japan. He, along with Inoue Kowashi, laid the foundation of Japan’s educational system by issuing several orders from 1886, which included the establishment of elementary, middle, normal school systems, and an imperial university system. This was a crucial step in Japan’s modernization efforts during the Meiji era.

==Early life==
Mori was born in the Satsuma domain (modern Kagoshima prefecture) from a &quot;samurai&quot; family, and educated in the &quot;Kaisenjo&quot; School for Western Learning run by the Satsuma domain. In 1865, he was sent as a student to University College London in Great Britain, where he studied western techniques in mathematics, physics, and naval surveying. He returned to Japan just after the start of the Meiji Restoration and took on a number of governmental positions within the new Meiji government.

==Meiji statesman==
Mori was the first Japanese ambassador to the United States, from 1871 to 1873. During his stay in the United States, he became very interested in western methods of education and western social institutions. On his return to Japan, he organized the Meirokusha, Japan&#x27;s first modern intellectual society.

Mori was a member of the Meiji Enlightenment movement, and advocated freedom of religion, secular education, equal rights for women (except for voting), international law, and most drastically, the abandonment of the Japanese language in favor of English.

In 1875, he established the &quot;Shoho Koshujo&quot; (Japan&#x27;s first commercial college), the predecessor of Hitotsubashi University. Thereafter, he successively served as ambassador to Qing dynasty China, Senior Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, ambassador to Great Britain, member of &quot;Sanjiin&quot; (legislative advisory council) and Education Ministry official.

He was recruited by Itō Hirobumi to join the first cabinet as Minister of Education and continued in the same post under the Kuroda administration from 1886 to 1889. During this period, he enacted the &quot;Mori Reforms&quot; of Japan&#x27;s education system, which included six years of compulsory, co-educational schooling, and the creation of high schools for training of a select elite. Under his leadership, the central ministry took greater control over school curriculum and emphasized Neo-Confucian morality and national loyalty in the lower schools while allowing some intellectual freedom in higher education.

He has been denounced by post-World War II liberals as a reactionary who was responsible for Japanese elitist and statist educational system, while he was equally condemned by his contemporaries as a radical who imposed unwanted westernization on Japanese society at the expense of Japanese culture and tradition. For example, he advocated the use of English. He was also a known Christian.

Mori was stabbed by an ultranationalist on the very day of promulgation of the Meiji Constitution in 1889, and died the next day. The assassin was outraged by Mori&#x27;s alleged failure to follow religious protocol during his visit to Ise Shrine two years earlier; for example, Mori was said to have not removed his shoes before entering and pushed aside a sacred veil with a walking stick.

Selected portions of his writings may be found in W.R. Braisted&#x27;s book &quot;Meiroku Zasshi: Journal of the Japanese Enlightenment&quot; which were originally published in a magazine entitled &quot;Meiroku zasshi&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Mori appears as a minor character in the alternate history novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, as an enthusiast of modernity and a protégé of Laurence Oliphant and in the speculative fiction novel ‘&quot;The Lost Future of Pepperharrow’&quot; by Natasha Pulley.

<text>Loch Morar () is a freshwater loch in the Rough Bounds of Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. It is the fifth-largest loch by surface area in Scotland, at , and the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles with a maximum depth of . The loch was created by glacial action around 10,000 years ago, and has a surface elevation of above sea level. It separates the traditional district of North Morar (which contains the village of Morar), from Arisaig and Moidart.

==Geography==

Loch Morar is long, has a surface area of , and is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles with a maximum depth of . In 1910, John Murray and Laurence Pullar found it to have a mean depth of and a total volume of during their survey of Scottish lochs. The bottom is deepened below the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, and until 1943, when a depth of was observed in the Inner Sound, it was believed to be the deepest water in the United Kingdom. The surface of the loch is above sea level.

The water of the loch is clear and oligotrophic, with a minimal intake of nutrients, making it a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The main inflow is the River Meoble on the southern side, which drains from Loch Beoraid, although there are three other major inflows at the eastern end of the loch and a stream draining a complex of lochans to the north-west of Loch Morar. The outflow is the River Morar at the western end, which at a few hundred metres long is one of the shortest rivers in the British Isles. At the shallower western end of the loch, there are a number of sizeable forested islands.

At the western end of the loch is the village of Morar, which is between Arisaig and Mallaig on the coastal A830 road. The settlements of Bracorina and Bracara are located along the northern shore of the loch, but there is no road along the southern shore. Tarbet, on the shore of Loch Nevis, is a short distance from Loch Morar.

==Folklore==

According to the posthumously published dictionary of the Scottish Gaelic language collected by Fr. Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), &quot;Loch Morar is said to be blessed by St. Columba and is called (), &#x27;St. Columba&#x27;s Well&#x27;. It is safe to drink its water though in the greatest heat and perspiration. It does not freeze. The only ice seen about it is at the foot of the mountain streams flowing into it.&quot; In relation to Loch Morar&#x27;s traditional veneration as a holy well, MacDonald also collected, &quot;a story of a young woman who had lost her hair which grew again after she had bathed her head in the Loch.&quot;

In common with Loch Ness, occasional reports of large unidentified creatures in the loch&#x27;s waters are made. The loch monster has been dubbed Mòrag.

==History==

The island in Loch Morar known as Eilean Bàn was traditionally used by the local population as grazing for their cattle herds and was, until trees began being planted in the 19th-century, completely bare of the &quot;dense, barely penetrable growth of timber&quot;, that covers the island today. The same island was briefly the location first of a Mass stone and then of an illegal and clandestine Catholic minor seminary founded by Bishop James Gordon, until the Jacobite rising of 1715 forced its closure and eventual reopening at Scalan in Glenlivet. Even long afterwards, Eilean Bàn remained a secret chapel and library for Bishop Gordon&#x27;s successors. According to Strathglass historian Flora Forbes, however, &quot;a Catholic chapel at this time anywhere throughout the Highlands was usually a barn-like structure, with no windows and a mud floor.&quot;

After the Battle of Culloden, a combined force of Royal Navy sailors under the command of Captain John Fergussone of and Captain Duff of and troops from the Campbell of Argyll Militia portaged over nine miles of uncharted, rough, and previously thought to be impassable terrain. They were seeking to capture Bishop Hugh MacDonald, the underground Roman Catholic Vicar General of the Highland District, and high-ranking local Jacobite Army veterans, mainly from Clan Donald, who were correctly suspected of meeting together at the library, former seminary, and Catholic chapel on Eilean Bàn in Loch Morar on 8 June 1746.

According to a later report for the Duke of Newcastle, &quot;Upon their arrival at the lake, they immediately spread themselves opposite to the Isle, and in full view of the rebels thereon; who, concluding themselves quite free from danger, fired on our people, at the same time calling them by insulting and opprobrious names, being near enough to be heard. This exultation, however, was quickly at an end; for the King&#x27;s ships having sailed round to that part of the coast where their boats had little more than a mile to be carried overland to the lake... the rebels immediately lost all courage...&quot;

Although the Bishop and the Jacobite leaders managed to quickly row from Eilean Bàn to the loch shore and &quot;escaped into the mountains&quot;, according the same report for the Duke of Newcastle, when the government soldiers and sailors arrived upon Eilean Bàn, &quot;They found the before-named Popish bishop&#x27;s house and chapel; which the sailors quickly gutted and demolished, merrily adorning themselves with the spoils of the chapel. In the scramble, a great many books and papers were tossed about and destroyed.&quot;

Some of the chapel and seminary foundation stones are still visibly upon Eilean Bàn. Watts has termed the 8 June 1746 book burning and the destruction of most of Bishop MacDonald personal papers, &quot;an irreplaceable loss both for the eighteenth-century Church and the scholar of today.&quot;
At least some items, though, are believed to have been removed from Eilean Bàn in time. In 1917, Dom Odo Blundell of Fort Augustus Abbey wrote, &quot;At Morar chapel-house is preserved a set of green vestments, with red and white intermingled, bearing the date 1745. It still has its original lining; there is also an altar front to match it. These were probably brought over from France by the adherents of Prince Charlie, and must have been part of the furnishings of the chapel on the island, though it is not known how they were saved when the building was ransacked and burned in 1746. The same remarks apply to the old chalice, which bears the inscription, &quot;Ad usum Pr Fr Vincenti Mariani, Missri Scot. Ord. Praedic. Anno 1658&quot;. This chalice, which is of silver, is very small indeed; it has its paten to match. Unfortunately, we have no further information regarding this early missioner. In the list of priests for 1668 it is stated that there were three Dominicans on this mission. Father Vincent was apparently one of these; the others being Father George Fanning - long in the Isle of Barra and Father Primrose - who died in prison in 1671.&quot;

Following the action, however, Capt. John Fergussone suspected &quot;that Lord Lovat&#x27;s lameness must have rendered it utterly impracticable for him to travel in so rugged a country&quot;, and the crew of HMS &quot;Furnace&quot; accordingly continued meticulously searching inside the caves surrounding the Loch, &quot;for three days and nights&quot;. They eventually, as Capt. Fergussone had expected, succeeded in capturing Lord Lovat, who was hiding inside a cave in nearby Glen Meoble.
In his naval history of the Jacobite rising and its aftermath, historian John S. Gibson commented about the capture of Lord Lovat at Loch Morar, &quot;London, which, with the events of the past year, had come to abhor highlanders, could scarcely have been more elated had Charles Edward himself been caught. A small mythology was quick to grow up about the circumstances of his capture, as in the contemporary print of Fergussone and the soldiers of Guise&#x27;s bursting in on the aged peer disguised as an old woman.&quot;

Following his escape into the mountains, Bishop MacDonald remained in hiding locally until he managed to escape to France, during the sixth attempt by the French Royal Navy and French privateers to find and rescue the Prince and his entourage, and was evacuated from what is now the Prince&#x27;s Cairn at Loch nan Uamh on 19 September 1746.
During the period of the Highland Clearances, many residents emigrated to Canada. Boats left in 1790, 1802, and 1826, carrying people to Quebec, Glengarry in Ontario, and the Strait of Canso in Nova Scotia respectively.

Swordland Lodge, on the northern shore of the loch, was used as training school STS 23b by the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War.
A 750 kW hydroelectric power station with a hydraulic head of was built on the River Morar and commissioned in 1948.

==Geology==

Loch Morar is located entirely within the Morar Group of sediments, which were deposited in the latter part of the Cambrian, and subsequently subjected to many phases of deformation.

The loch occupies a basin produced by the overdeepening of the valley by glacial erosion, along an east–west fault line. It is not a sea loch due to isostatic rebound that raised the rock sill at the end of the loch.

Based on estimates of erosion of between per year, the deep basin was created over a period of 67,000 – 150,000 years of glacial action, which occurred intermittently during the last million years of the Quaternary glaciation. An outwash fan made up of sand and gravels at the western end of the loch marks the limit of the re-advance in the Morar valley. Subsequently, colonised by vegetation and known as Mointeach Mhòr (the mossy plain), these deposits blocked the outflow of the loch to the south, so that it drained from the north-west corner instead.

The catchment area of the loch is , and the geology is base-poor. A site to the north of the loch was selected in 2011 as a SSSI for its characteristic rock exposures of the Moine group by the Geological Conservation Review, replacing the area around Mallaig harbour, which had been previously regarded as the most representative site.

==Wildlife==
The loch is surrounded by a mix of natural woodland, open hillside, sheep and cattle pasture and planted mixed coniferous and broadleaf woodlands. Only around 0.7% of the surface of the loch can be colonised by plants.

===Fish===
Loch Morar&#x27;s fish population is believed to be limited to Atlantic Salmon, brown trout and sea trout, Arctic char, eel, stickleback, and minnow. Trout average around in size, but ferox trout of up to have been caught. The loch is also known to contain eels, although none were caught in a recent survey of eel populations in Lochaber, suggesting that they prefer the loch to the tributaries surveyed. Catches of salmon and sea trout declined dramatically between the 1970s and 1980s, in common with other catchments on the west coast. Artificial stocking of the River Morar with salmon and sea trout was suspended in 2007 after the hatchery was closed.

The main salmonid spawning grounds are the River Meoble and the smaller burns that feed into the loch. The hydroelectric power station, which contain one of only two fish counters in Lochaber, is shut down during the smolt run, following a study on smolt mortality in 1992.

The catchment is managed by the Morar District Salmon Fishery Sub-board, which employs a full-time fisheries manager. Poaching in the form of netting has been known to occur at the mouth of the River Morar.

The favorable climatic conditions and closeness to Vladivostok (the administrative center of the krai) predetermined the district&#x27;s specialization. There are seven agricultural enterprises which provide Vladivostok with meat, milk, eggs, vegetables, and potatoes. Mink, foxes, s, and deer are bred in the district.

For more than a hundred years, the brown coal deposits have been exploited in the territory of the district (Tavrichanskoye Deposit), and construction sand in the Razdolnaya River Valley has been the raw material for silicate brick production. The &quot;Razdolnensky Construction Materials Plant&quot;, which is one of the district&#x27;s largest enterprises, is involved in the production of bricks. There are deposits of porous basalt, which is the raw material used by &quot;Terekhovsky Concrete Production Plant&quot;. Not far from Kiparisovo railway station are beds of sandstone which is the quartz-containing raw materials used by the glass industry. The largest glassworks in Primorsky Krai is located here.

===Transportation===
A federal road connects the settlement of Razdolnoye with Khasan, located on the North Korea–Russia border.

<doc id="620529" wikidata="Q217694" url="?curid=620529" title="Grader">
<text>A grader, also commonly referred to as a road grader, motor grader, or simply blade, is a form of heavy equipment with a long blade used to create a flat surface during grading. Although the earliest models were towed behind horses, and later tractors, most modern graders are self-propelled and thus technically &quot;motor graders&quot;.

Typical graders have three axles, with the steering wheels in front, followed by the grading blade or mouldboard, then a cab and engine atop tandem rear axles. Some graders also have front-wheel drives for improved performance. Some graders have optional rear attachments, such as a ripper, scarifier, or compactor. A blade forward of the front axle may also be added. For snowplowing and some dirt grading operations, a main blade extension can also be mounted.

Capacities range from a blade width of 2.50 to 7.30 m (8 to 24  ft) and engines from 93–373 kW (125–500 hp). Certain graders can operate multiple attachments, or be designed for specialized tasks like underground mining.

==Function==

In civil engineering &quot;rough grading&quot; is performed by heavy equipment such as wheel tractor-scrapers and bulldozers. Graders are used to &quot;finish grade&quot;, with the angle, tilt (or pitch), and height of their blade capable of being adjusted to a high level of precision.

Graders are commonly used in the construction and maintenance of dirt and gravel roads. In constructing paved roads, they prepare a wide flat base course for the final road surface. Graders are also used to set native soil or gravel foundation pads to finish grade before the construction of large buildings. Graders can produce canted surfaces for drainage or safety. They may be used to produce drainage ditches with shallow V-shaped cross-sections on either side of highways.

Steering is performed via a steering wheel, or a joystick capable of controlling both the angle and cant of the front wheels. Many models also allow frame articulation between the front and rear axles, which allows a smaller turning radius in addition to allowing the operator to adjust the articulation angle to aid in the efficiency of moving material. Other implement functions are typically hydraulically powered and can be directly controlled by levers, or by joystick inputs or electronic switches controlling electrohydraulic servo valves.

Graders are also outfitted with modern digital grade control technologies, such as those manufactured by Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc., Trimble Navigation, Leica Geosystems, or Mikrofyn. These may combine both laser and GPS guidance to establish precise grade control and (potentially) &quot;stateless&quot; construction. Manufacturers such as John Deere have also begun to integrate these technologies during construction.
==History==
Early graders were drawn by humans and draft animals. The Fresno Scraper is a machine pulled by horses used for constructing canals and ditches in sandy soil. The design of the Fresno Scraper forms the basis of most modern earthmoving scrapers, having the ability to scrape and move a quantity of soil, and also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually. The Fresno scraper was invented in 1883 by James Porteous. Working with farmers in Fresno, California, he had recognised the dependence of the Central San Joaquin Valley on irrigation, and the need for a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil. In perfecting the design of his machine, Porteous made several revisions on his own and also traded ideas with William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, who invented and held patents on similar scrapers. 

The era of motorization by traction engines, steam tractors, motor trucks, and tractors saw such towed graders grow in size and productivity. The first self-propelled grader was made in 1920 by the Russell Grader Manufacturing Company, which called it the Russell Motor Hi-Way Patrol. These early graders were created by adding the grader blade as an attachment to a generalist tractor unit. After purchasing the company in 1928, Caterpillar went on to truly integrate the tractor and grader into one design—at the same time replacing crawler tracks with wheels to yield the first rubber-tire self-propelled grader, the Caterpillar Auto Patrol, released in 1931.

==Regional uses==
In addition to their use in road construction, graders may also be used to perform roughly equivalent work.

In some locales such as Northern Europe, Canada, and places in the United States, graders are often used in municipal and residential snow removal. In scrubland and grassland areas of Australia and Africa, graders are often an essential piece of equipment on ranches, large farms, and plantations to make dirt tracks where the absence of rocks and trees means bulldozers are not required.

<text>Chuguyevsky District () is an administrative and municipal district (raion), one of the twenty-two in Primorsky Krai, Russia. It is located in the center of the krai. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) of Chuguyevka. Population: The population of Chuguyevka accounts for 48.8% of the district&#x27;s total population.

==Geography==
The territory is rugged by the ranges and spurs of Sikhote-Alin mountain system and almost totally covered with forests and bushes mainly of coniferous-deciduous kind. There is a game reserve in the territory of the district which is remarkable for its highland landscape with specific fauna and endemic insect species. In 2007, Zov Tigra national park based on this game preserve was established in the district.

==Economy==
The district&#x27;s industry is represented by the krai&#x27;s largest timber industry enterprises which are involved in commercial timber processing, saw timber, and technological wood chips and plywood production. Development and utilization of perlites, zeolites, and vermiculites as well as forest food resources are considered prospective.

There is a large deposit of perlite and vermiculite which can be used as a filler in a concrete-processing industry. A zeolite deposit is exploited in the district. There are stocks of the gravel-sand mixture and pebble, and a unique deposit of decorative collectible stones.

Agriculture is specialized in potato growing, milk and meat cattle breeding. The arable area comprises some western part of the district, with its rich alluvial soils of the upper to middle valleys of the Ussuri River.

<text>Toffee is an English confection made by caramelizing sugar or molasses (creating inverted sugar) along with butter, and occasionally flour. The mixture is heated until its temperature reaches the hard crack stage of . While being prepared, toffee is sometimes mixed with nuts or raisins.

== Variants and applications ==
A popular variant in the United States is &quot;English toffee&quot;, which is a very buttery toffee often made with almonds. It is available in both chewy and hard versions. Heath bars are a brand of confection made with an English toffee core. Although named &quot;English toffee,&quot; it bears little resemblance to the wide range of confectionery known as toffee currently available in the United Kingdom. However, one can still find this product in the UK under the name &quot;butter crunch&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word are unknown. Food writer Harold McGee claims it to be &quot;from the Creole for a mixture of sugar and molasses&quot;, but which creole language is not specified. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the first publication of the word to 1825 and identifies it as a variation of the word &quot;taffy&quot; (1817), both of which are first recorded as English dialectical words.

The word is similar to the Akan language word &quot;tafere&quot; which can be translated as &quot;to lick (one&#x27;s fingers)&quot;.

<text>Edward Joseph Herlihy (August 14, 1909 – January 30, 1999) was an American newsreel narrator for Universal-International. He was also a long-time radio and television announcer for NBC, hosting &quot;The Horn and Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; in the 1940s and 1950, and was briefly interim announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1962. He was also the voice of Kraft Foods radio and television commercials from the 1940s through the early 1980s. When he died in 1999, his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he was &quot;A Voice of Cheer and Cheese&quot;.

==Radio and television==
Educated at Boston College, graduating in 1932, he gained his first radio job in his home town, at Boston&#x27;s WLOE. When he was hired by NBC in 1935, he decamped for New York, along with his friend, fellow Boston announcer Frank Gallop, who was hired by CBS. In their early days as network announcers, Herlihy and Gallop shared an apartment on West 45th Street. Herlihy was immediately successful in network radio, at that time in its sharpest ascendancy. He was the announcer for many radio shows from the 1930s, to the 1950s, among them: &quot;America&#x27;s Town Meeting&quot;, &quot;The Big Show&quot;, &quot;The Falcon&quot;, &quot;Mr. District Attorney&quot;, and &quot;Just Plain Bill&quot;. He became the host of &quot;The Horn and Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; on radio in 1948, remaining its announcer when the show went to television. He continued his success in the new medium: his early television credits included Sid Caesar&#x27;s hit &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and soap operas &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;. He was also the host of &quot;Recollections At 30&quot;, which was a special NBC Radio series created for the network&#x27;s 30th birthday.

===Kraft Foods===
In 1947 Herlihy began his long association with Kraft Foods on radio, and continued it when the company sponsored the &quot;Kraft Television Theater&quot; on television in the 1950s. Richard Severo writes in his obituary of Herlihy that the show—and Herlihy&#x27;s talent—suited Kraft well:

A dramatic offering, all of it done live, the show featured everything from Shakespeare to Rod Serling; it was at the center of what critics would come to call television&#x27;s Golden Age. During commercials for Kraft products (&quot;Good food and good food ideas,&quot; Mr. Herlihy would say), audiences heard only his voice, a voice he said he tried to make sound friendly. It was an avuncular, next-door-neighbor, deep, mellow kind of voice, a digestive guide through the preparation of all manner of souffles, dips, marshmallow salads and fondues. He was noted for his ability to ad lib through commercials when dramatic presentations ran too long or too short.

Herlihy&#x27;s role as Kraft spokesman lasted nearly 40 years, his voice becoming as familiar as a next-door neighbor&#x27;s. From his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;He liked to recall a summer day in Times Square when he helped a blind man to cross at 44th Street. He took the man&#x27;s arm, and the man said it was a beautiful day. &quot;Yes,&quot; Herlihy replied, &quot;this is the kind of day the Lord made for the good guys.&quot; The blind man replied: &quot;I know you. You&#x27;re the cheese man on TV.&quot;&quot; In his capacity with Kraft, Severo writes, Herlihy &quot;introduced Cheez Whiz, offered innumerable entreaties to buy Velveeta and delivered eloquent apologias for the entombment of almost anything edible with Miracle Whip&quot;.

==Newsreel narration==

For Universal Newsreels in the 1940s, Herlihy narrated editions describing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allies&#x27; early setbacks against the Axis powers, the turning of the tide of World War II, the death of President Roosevelt, the execution of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and the detonation of the first atomic bombs. In the next decade, during the Cold War, he narrated the first American newsreel on the launch of Sputnik.

==Films and stage==
When he worked for Sid Caesar in the 1950s, Herlihy met Woody Allen, then a fledgling writer. Allen was so impressed with Herlihy&#x27;s voice that he used him in several of his films in the 1980s, including &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, &quot;Radio Days&quot;, and &quot;Zelig&quot;; his other film credits included &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; as the announcer for The Jerry Langford Show and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; as Francis&#x27;s father, Mr. Buxton.

He also appeared in road company stage productions outside New York City, including &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;Good News&quot; and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. He was in &quot;Watergate: The Musical&quot;, in Atlanta in 1982; Herlihy played Senator Sam Ervin, a role for which he spent $40 for a pair of bushy eyebrows, only to find that they would not move up and down.

==Later life==
Herlihy made his last TV appearance on a PBS tribute &quot;N.Y. TV: By the People Who Made It&quot; in 1999.

Herlihy died of natural causes at his home in Manhattan, New York City, aged 89.

The Herlihy family is one of the supporters of the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey; the foyer, with its oil portrait of Herlihy, is named in his memory.

<text>Airscape is a Belgian trance act composed of Johan Gielen. Formerly including Sven Maes, the group also recorded as Svenson &amp; Gielen () and several other pseudonyms. The original two-man group dissolved in 2005, each going solo. In 2009, Airscape was revived as a solo project by Johan Gielen.

==History==
The name Airscape was first used by Johan Gielen for work with other producers, mostly Jos Borremans. Gielen and Sven Maes started producing together in 1994 under the alias Body Heat. It wouldn&#x27;t be until 1997 that they would resurrect the Airscape name, and until 2000 that they would become known as Svenson &amp; Gielen.

They are known for their songs like &quot;L&#x27;Esperanza&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Beauty of Silence&quot; (2000), but are also known for their remixes of singles such as Tiësto&#x27;s &quot;Sparkles&quot;, Vengaboys&#x27; &quot;Kiss (When the Sun Don&#x27;t Shine)&quot;, Chicane&#x27;s &quot;Halcyon&quot; and Delerium&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot;, the latter of which was used as the lead single release and in the music video of the song when it was re-issued in 2000, reaching the top 3 of the UK Singles Chart. Their remixes have a distinctive and easily recognized style; they fade in and out looped vocals, overlay simple chord patterns on a fuzzy-sounding synthesizer, and almost always cut the bass and drums about halfway through the song to bring an ostinato to the foreground before returning to the main theme. Similar elements can be found to a lesser degree in their original music as well.

In 2005, the Airscape project took a firm break when Sven Maes left the project, but in 2009 Johan Gielen resurrected Airscape as a solo project and injected it with a new release, &quot;My Love&quot; featuring Jes.

<doc id="620568" wikidata="Q193290" url="?curid=620568" title="Ashurnasirpal II">
<text>Ashur-nasir-pal II (transliteration: &quot;Aššur-nāṣir-apli&quot;, meaning &quot;Ashur is guardian of the heir&quot;) was the third king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 883 to 859 BC. Ashurnasirpal II succeeded his father, Tukulti-Ninurta II. His son and successor was Shalmaneser III and his queen was Mullissu-mukannišat-Ninua.

==Reign==
During his reign he embarked on a vast program of expansion, first conquering the peoples to the north in Asia Minor as far as Nairi and exacting tribute from Phrygia, then invading Aram (modern Syria) conquering the Aramaeans and Neo-Hittites between the Khabur and the Euphrates Rivers. The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art.

==Cruelty==
Ashurnasirpal II was notorious for his brutality, using enslaved captives to build a new Assyrian capital at Kalhu (Nimrud) in Mesopotamia where he built many impressive monuments. He was also a shrewd administrator, who realized that he could gain greater control over his empire by installing Assyrian governors, rather than depending on local client rulers paying tribute.

His harshness prompted a revolt that he crushed decisively in a pitched, two-day battle. According to his monument inscription, while recalling this massacre he says:

Following this victory, he advanced without opposition as far as the Mediterranean and exacted tribute from Phoenicia. On his return home, he moved his capital to the city of Kalhu (Nimrud).

==Campaigns==

Like previous Assyrian monarchs, Ashurnasirpal campaigned along the Euphrates against Aramaeans and in the Diyala against Babylon. Ashurnasirpal II&#x27;s brutal treatment of rebels ensured that even when his army was not present, there would not be further revolts. Further revolts saw the local monarch replaced with a governor, loyal only to the Assyrian monarchy. Leading his army, which was typically composed of infantry (including auxiliaries and foreigners), heavy cavalry, light cavalry and chariots, Ashurnasirpal conquered the Hittites and Aramaean states of northern Syria.

Ashurnasirpal II did not destroy the Phoenician/Canaanite cities he conquered. He was unsuccessful in his siege of Tyre, which under Ittobaal settled Kition in Cyprus and opened up trade routes throughout the Aegean, at Rhodes and Miletus. Through tribute they became sources for the raw materials of his armies and his building programs. Iron was needed for weapons, Lebanese cedar for construction and gold and silver for the payment of troops.

When considering the occupied citizens of his conquered territories, he wrote:
I resettled them in their abandoned towns and houses. I imposed more tribute and tax on them than ever before: horses, mules, oxen, sheep, wine and labor.

== Balawat Gates ==

The Balawat Gates, or the &quot;Balawat Bronze Bands&quot; are three sets of decorated bronze bands that had adorned the main doors of several buildings at Balawat (ancient Imgur-Enlil). Two of them date to the reign of Ashurnasirpal II. The third set of the Bronze Bands depicts the exploits of his son Shalmaneser III.

After the Neo-Assyrian Empire fell and Balawat was destroyed, the wooden elements of the gates decomposed. Most of the bronze bands survive, and can be found in museums. The gates were originally 6.8 metres high.

The gates were first discovered by the Iraqi archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam on a British Museum expedition in 1878. They were found in the doorway of the king&#x27;s palace. That set of the Balawat Bronze Bands is now on permanent display in London. The second set of the Bands was excavated by Sir Max Mallowan in 1956 in the Temple of Mamu, the Mesopotamian goddess associated with dreams. It was on display in the Mosul Museum in Iraq, but is now largely missing because of the looting in the wake of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The documentation of these Bands is available in a 2008 publication by the British Museum. Destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts further occurred in 2015 because of a terrorist attack.

These sets include 32 bands of figurative scenes embossed on bronze, including cuneiform inscriptions. They provide a wealth of historical and art-historical information about the ninth century BC Assyria and surrounding region.

==Palace of Kalhu==
Ashurnasirpal II&#x27;s palace in Kalhu (Nimrud, which is in modern-day Iraq slightly south of Mosul) probably began construction c.878 BC, and is now generally accepted as having been completed after around 15 years alongside the near-total reconstruction of the Middle Assyrian city, c.864 BC. An inscription describing its inauguration details a ten-day banquet which 69,574 people attended. The palace walls were lined with reliefs carved in alabaster. These reliefs bore elaborate carvings, many portraying the king surrounded by winged protective spirits, or engaged in hunting or on campaign. 

Each relief had text inscribed in it. This text was the same or very similar on each relief and is therefore called the Standard Inscription. The Standard Inscription begins by tracing Ashur-nasir-pal II&#x27;s lineage back three generations and recounts his military victories, defines the boundaries of his empire, tells how he founded Kalhu, and built the palace. Ashurnasirpal II also built a massive gateway at Nimrud.

The British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard excavated Kalhu in the 1840s, uncovering the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II. Today, many of the reliefs and sculptures from the excavations in Nimrud are displayed in the galleries of the British Museum, London, including the Statue of Ashurnasirpal II and the Black Obelisk by his son Shalmaneser III, with other reliefs on display in museums in Europe (e.g. Munich), Japan and the USA.

===Nimrud reliefs===
After Assyria fell in 612 BC, the palace became overgrown and eventually completely buried, in which state it remained for nearly 2,500 years until rediscovered by the British-born A.H. Layard in 1845. Layard oversaw the excavation of the palace during which time the reliefs that dominated the walls of the structure were removed from the site and sent to collections throughout Europe and North America, with the British Museum receiving the majority of these Nimrud reliefs. Despite excavating and removing many of these reliefs, a great number remained within the palace and were eventually reburied with time.

M.E.L. Mallowan re-excavated the site from 1947 until 1957, when the project was taken over by the Iraq Department of Antiques which still has legal authority over the site. The known area of the palace measures 200m from north to south and 120 meters from east to west. This is most likely only a portion of the original design, including the possibility of an upper level while no concrete evidence of this remains. All of the walls of the palace were lined with stone slabs of which a majority were decorated with relief images.


====Symbolism and purpose====
Among these relief images occurred a certain amount of standardization around 870 BC. Carved into each of the stone slabs, including the ones lacking relief, was what is referred to as the Standard Inscription. This text gave the various names and titles of the king, spoke of his relationship with the gods and summarized his military conquests. The text also goes on to describe the founding of Kalhu and speaks of the palace itself. The slabs, which contain relief, consist of depictions of Assurnasirpal&#x27;s royal ideology. This ideology can be categorized into four main ideas, the military success of the king, his service to the gods, which provided divine protection and Assyrian prosperity. 

There is a particular interest in the anatomy of both humans and animals within the depictions. Royal hunting scenes are some of the most well known of the Nimrud reliefs particularly those showing Assurnasirpal II hunting lions. There is also a distinct interest in the relationship between man and animal in many of the scenes. In several depictions the king is shown with supernatural creatures of animal and human combination. All of the apotropaic portrayals, which would have decorated the doorways of the palace, were of these human and animal hybrids. Within the context of these apotropaic figures were three main types, a winged figure wearing the horned crown which symbolized divinity, a winged figure wearing a headband of rosettes and a winged human figure with the head of a bird.

====Recurring subject matter====

Other popular themes in the Nimrud reliefs included military campaigns and victories garnered by the Assyrians. More specifically these were displays of the relationships between Assyrians and non-Assyrians. The Assyrians were always shown in moments of glory while the non-Assyrians are in sprawled or contorted positions and most often naked. These illustrations represented violent death as punishment for violating Assyrian values, as well as merciless punishment for transgressions. Not only would this have served as a clear message for visiting dignitaries from other cultures but also the same message was innately obvious as a warning to the Assyrian elites as to what could happen if they decided to defy the king. 

Non-elites were likely not viewing these reliefs, as they would not have often, if ever, been permitted into the palace. The elites would have typically only been present at the palace for rituals and other business with the king. Assyrian women tend to be absent from all of these relief sculptures. This is most likely due to the context of the reliefs, which were male dominated activities. The only exception to women being absent from these scenes is non-Assyrian women who were captured as slaves during war. These were typically the elite women of other cultures, rather than the lower class. In contrast to the way in which male captives were portrayed, women were neither bound nor naked in their depictions. Women captives were most often shown in floor length outfits, with possibly one part of their body exposed in detail.

====Site post-excavations====
Not all of the relief sculptures have been removed from the palace at Nimrud. Many of them are able to be viewed in their original context, although this is greatly limited. Many of the museums, which currently display the Nimrud reliefs, attempt to recreate the palace atmosphere by exhibiting them in a similar fashion to their original loci.

In November 2014, it was reported that ISIL, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, militants had looted many of Iraq&#x27;s archaeological sites, including the palace of Ashurnasirpal II, and were selling artifacts on the black market. According to Aymen Jawad, executive director of Iraq Heritage (based in London), &quot;Tablets, manuscripts and cuneiforms are the most common artifacts being traded, and, unfortunately, this is being seen in Europe and America,”&quot; he said. &quot;“Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of irreplaceable pieces are being sold to fund terrorists.&quot;

On 5 March 2015 ISIL reportedly started the demolition of Nimrud. The local palace was bulldozed. Lamassu statues at the gates of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II were smashed.

<doc id="620571" wikidata="Q1909566" url="?curid=620571" title="Matthew Lyon">
<text>Matthew Lyon (July 14, 1749 – August 1, 1822) was an Irish-born American printer, farmer, soldier and politician, who served as a United States representative from both Vermont and Kentucky.

Lyon represented Vermont in Congress from 1797 to 1801, and represented Kentucky from 1803 to 1811. His tenure in Congress was tumultuous. He brawled with one Congressman, and was jailed on charges of violating the Sedition Act, winning re-election to Congress from inside his jail cell.

Lyon&#x27;s trial, conviction, and incarceration boosted his status among the fledgling Democratic-Republican Party as a free-speech martyr.

==Early life and military career==
Lyon attended school in Dublin, after having been born in nearby County Wicklow, Ireland. Some sources indicate that his father was executed for treason against the British government of Ireland, and Lyon worked as a boy to help support his widowed mother. He began to learn the printer and bookbinder trades in 1763, but emigrated to Connecticut as a redemptioner in 1764. To pay his debt, he worked for Jabez Bacon, a farmer and merchant in Woodbury. The debt was later purchased by merchant and farmer Hugh Hannah of Litchfield; while working for Hannah (or Hanna), Lyon continued his education through self-study when he was able. By working for wages when he was permitted, Lyon saved enough to purchase the remainder of his indenture, and he became a free man in 1768.

While living in Connecticut, Lyon became acquainted with many individuals who became the first white settlers of Vermont. In 1774, Lyon moved to Wallingford, Vermont (then known as the New Hampshire Grants), where he farmed and organized a company of militia. He was an adjutant in Colonel Seth Warner&#x27;s regiment in Canada in 1775, and in July 1776 was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Green Mountain Boys&#x27; regiment. He moved to Arlington, Vermont, in 1777.

During the Revolutionary War, Lyon initially served under Horatio Gates in upstate New York and Vermont. In a version of the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon&#x27;s version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put to good use, he asked to leave Gates&#x27; command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon&#x27;s conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.

Lyon subsequently joined Warner&#x27;s regiment as a paymaster with the rank of captain, and served during the Battle of Bennington and other actions. After leaving Warner&#x27;s Regiment following the Battle of Saratoga, Lyon continued his revolutionary activity, serving as a member of Vermont&#x27;s Council of Safety, a captain in the militia (later advancing to colonel), paymaster general of the Vermont Militia, deputy secretary to Governor Thomas Chittenden, and assistant to Vermont&#x27;s treasurer.

==Political career in Vermont==

Lyon served as a member from Arlington in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1779 to 1783. He founded Fair Haven, Vermont in 1783 and returned to the state House of Representatives from 1787 to 1796 as its member. In October 1785, while serving as clerk of the Vermont Court of Confiscation, Lyon was impeached by the Vermont Council of Censors for his failure to provide the state with records of the Court of Confiscation. Three days later, after an impeachment trial before both the council and the governor, Lyon was reprimanded and ordered by the court of impeachment to pay the expenses of the prosecution. It was additionally ordered by the court of impeachment that Lyon be fined 500 pounds if he failed to comply by delivering the documents. Lyon requested a new trial, and the Council obliged, again finding against him. There are no records that suggest that Lyon paid any of the fines he was ordered to, however. Lyon was elected assistant judge of Rutland County in 1786 and was elected to again serve in the state house later the following year.

Lyon also built and operated various kinds of mills in Fair Haven, including a gristmill, sawmill, and paper mill, in addition to an iron foundry. In 1793, he started a printing office and published the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Library&quot; newspaper; though his son James was the nominal owner, Matthew Lyon oversaw the paper&#x27;s management and supplied much of its content. The newspaper was later renamed to the &quot;Fair Haven Gazette&quot;, and was published until Lyon sold its works. In 1794, Lyon sold the printing press and other equipment for the &quot;Gazette&quot; to Reverend Samuel Williams and Judge Samuel Williams of Rutland, who used it to found the &quot;Rutland Herald&quot;.

===Congress===
Lyon was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Second and Third Congresses. He unsuccessfully contested the election of Israel Smith to the Fourth Congress. Lyon won election as a Democratic-Republican to the Fifth and Sixth Congresses (March 4, 1797 – March 3, 1801); he was not a candidate for renomination in 1800.

====Altercation with Roger Griswold====

Lyon had the distinction of being one of the first two members investigated for a supposed violation of House rules when he was accused of &quot;gross indecency&quot; for spitting in Roger Griswold&#x27;s face; Griswold was investigated for attacking Lyon in retaliation.

On January 30, 1798, the House was considering whether to remove William Blount of Tennessee from office. Griswold was trying to attract Lyon&#x27;s attention in order to have a dialogue on the issue, but Lyon was ignoring him on purpose, since they belonged to opposing political parties (Lyon was a Democratic-Republican and Griswold a Federalist). Griswold finally lost his temper and insulted Lyon by calling him a scoundrel, which at the time was considered profanity. Their clash escalated when Lyon declared himself willing to fight for the interest of the common man. Mockingly, Griswold asked if Lyon would be using his wooden sword, a reference to Lyon&#x27;s supposed dismissal from Gates&#x27; command during the Revolution. Furious, Lyon spat tobacco juice on Griswold, earning himself the nickname &quot;The Spitting Lyon&quot;.

Lyon later apologized to the House as a whole, claiming he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs to get him to let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.

====Imprisonment for sedition====

Lyon also has the distinction of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about the American government as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon was the first person to be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.

Lyon had launched his own newspaper, &quot;The Scourge of Aristocracy and Repository of Important Political Truth&quot;, when the &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; refused to publish his writings. On October 1, Lyon printed an editorial which included charges that Adams had an &quot;unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice,&quot; as well as the accusation that Adams had corrupted the Christian religion to further his war aims. Before the Alien and Sedition Acts had been passed, Lyon had also written a letter to Alden Spooner, the publisher of the &quot;Vermont Journal&quot;. In this letter, which Lyon wrote in response to criticism in the &quot;Journal&quot;, Lyon called the president &quot;bullying,&quot; and the Senate&#x27;s responses &quot;stupid.&quot;

Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists pushed for this letter to be printed in the &quot;Vermont Journal&quot;, which Spooner did, thus adding additional charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon&#x27;s defense was to be the unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon&#x27;s particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner as well as that of Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution&#x27;s safeguards against &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws. This defense was not allowed.

Lyon was sentenced to four months in a jail cell used for felons, counterfeiters, thieves, and runaway slaves in Vergennes, and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and court costs (); Judge William Paterson lamented being unable to give a harsher punishment. A bit of a resistance movement was created; the Green Mountain Boys even threatened to destroy the jail and might have done so if not for Lyon&#x27;s urging peaceful resistance. While in jail, Lyon won election to the Sixth Congress by nearly doubling the votes of his closest adversary, 4,576 to 2,444. Upon his release, Lyon exclaimed to a crowd of supporters: &quot;I am on my way to Philadelphia!&quot;

After years of effort by his heirs, in 1840 Congress passed a bill authorizing a refund of the fine Lyon incurred under the Alien and Sedition Acts and other expenses he accrued as the result of his imprisonment, plus interest.

====Election of 1800====
In the election of 1800, the vote went to the House of Representatives because of a tie in electoral votes between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, who were supposed to have been the Democratic-Republican candidates for president and vice president respectively. Many Federalists decided Burr as president was preferable to Jefferson.

House members voted by state, with a majority required for a state&#x27;s vote to be awarded, and a majority of nine states required to win. During the first 35 ballots, Jefferson carried eight states and Burr six, with two states counted as &quot;no result&quot; because of a tie among their House members. Vermont was one of the two &quot;no result&quot; states, because Lewis Morris voted for Burr and Lyon cast his ballot for Jefferson. On the 36th ballot, several Federalists decided to break the impasse by allowing the election of Jefferson through either casting blank ballots or absenting themselves from the House chamber during the vote. Morris was among the Federalists who took part; as a result of Morris&#x27;s decision to be absent, Lyon&#x27;s vote for Jefferson moved Vermont into his column. Vermont was one of two states to switch from &quot;no result&quot; to Jefferson, and he carried 10 states on the final ballot; Lyon thus played an important role in Jefferson&#x27;s victory.

==Later career==

===Kentucky===
Lyon moved to Kentucky by 1801, settling in Eddyville in Livingston County, Kentucky (later Caldwell County and now Lyon County). He established a paper mill propelled by oxen and a distillery, and subsequently engaged in boat building. Lyon also owned ten slaves in 1810.

The Department of War employed him to build gunboats for the War of 1812. When the war ended, Lyon had on hand large quantities of wood and other supplies he had purchased at wartime prices for this endeavor; the government subsequently failed to honor its contract, and Lyon became bankrupt. He worked diligently to repair his finances, and by 1818 he had satisfied his debts and was again living in comfortable circumstances.

====Return to Congress====
He became a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1802 and was elected to the 8th United States Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1803 – March 3, 1811). He sought reelection in 1810 to the 12th Congress, but was unsuccessful.

===Arkansas===
After repaying his debts and recovering financially, but failing to obtain payment for his war of 1812 contract, Lyon solicited a federal appointment that would provide a salary and stability in his final years. In 1820, President James Monroe, a friend and political supporter of Lyon&#x27;s, appointed him United States factor to the Cherokee Nation in the Arkansas Territory. He again attempted to serve in Washington, D.C. by running for the Arkansas Territory&#x27;s delegate seat in Congress against incumbent James Woodson Bates. He narrowly lost the election to serve in the 17th Congress (1,081 to 1,020), and then unsuccessfully contested the result. Lyon wrote to the House that the governor of the territory and other officials refused to allow him to inspect ballots and returns, or to have a hearing where he could call witnesses. As a result, Lyon was unable to gather proof to support his claim to the seat. He withdrew his contest, and Bates continued to serve.

==Death and burial==
Lyon died in Spadra Bluff, Crawford County, Arkansas (now within Clarksville, Johnson County, Arkansas) on August 1, 1822. He was initially interred in Spadra Bluff Cemetery, and in 1833 he was reinterred in Eddyville Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Lyon was married twice. His first wife was Mary Horsford whom he married in 1772. She was the daughter of Samuel Horsford and Mary Grant and had been married previously to Daniel Allen, the uncle of Ethan Allen, until his death in 1772. She died in 1782. Lyon&#x27;s second marriage was to Beulah M. Chittenden, the daughter of Thomas Chittenden, in 1784.

His son James (1776–1824) was a newspaper editor and publisher in Vermont and several southern states, and worked with both his father and James Thomson Callender. Lyon&#x27;s son Chittenden Lyon (1787–1842) was also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1827–1835) from Kentucky. His son Matthew (1792–1839) was the father of Confederate General Hylan B. Lyon of Lyon County, Kentucky.

His daughters Anne and Pamelia married John Messinger and George Cadwell, respectively, pioneers and politicians of Illinois.

Lyon was also the great-grandfather of William Peters Hepburn, who represented Iowa in Congress. One of Lyon&#x27;s descendants is the American operatic baritone Sherrill Milnes.

According to research conducted by The Washington Post in 2022, Lyon was included in the list of more than 1,700 men who served in the U.S. Congress who owned slaves.

==Legacy==
In 2006, the post office in Fair Haven was named for Lyon. In 2018, a concept album based on the life of Matthew Lyon, &quot;Spit&#x27;n Lyon&quot; was released. Music &amp; Lyrics by John Daly, orchestration &amp; recording by Greg Goldman, musical support from Neil Maurer.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>Paavo Allan Engelbert Berglund (14 April 192925 January 2012) was a Finnish conductor and violinist.

==Career==
Born in Helsinki, Berglund studied the violin as a child, and played an instrument made by his grandfather. By age 15, he had decided on music as his career, and by 18 was playing in restaurants.

During the Second World War, Berglund worked at the iron factories in Billnäs. Children were moved out of Helsinki during heavy stages of the war. His professional career as a violinist began in 1946, playing the whole summer at the officers&#x27; mess (Upseerikasino) in Helsinki. He had already played in dance orchestras in 1945. Formal study took place in Helsinki at the Sibelius Academy, in Vienna and in Salzburg. He was a violinist in the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1949 to 1958 in the 1st violin section, unique among the instrumentalists in being accommodated for seating to account for the fact that he played the violin &#x27;left-handed&#x27;.

In a radio interview made of the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE in 2002, Berglund explains how he heard the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on their tour in Helsinki with Wilhelm Furtwängler and was very impressed. Shortly after that he left for Vienna to study. He had many friends both in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna Radio Symphony orchestras, and could attend rehearsal and recording sessions. One particular recording session he remembers is when he was present one evening when Furtwängler recorded Schumann&#x27;s Manfred Overture and Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Die Moldau&quot; (Vltava) at the Musikverein in Vienna. Another conductor that he was very impressed with was Hans Knappertsbusch.

Berglund&#x27;s conducting career began in 1949, when he founded his own chamber orchestra. In 1953, Berglund co-founded the Helsinki Chamber Orchestra (partly inspired by the Boyd Neel Orchestra).

In 1955, he was appointed Associate Conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and served as chief conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1962 to 1971. Berglund became music director of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 1975 and held the post for four seasons. He was conductor of the mixed voice choir of the Student Union of the University of Helsinki, The Academic Choral Society (Akateeminen Laulu) from 1959–61.

Berglund attained notoriety as a strict orchestral disciplinarian due to his ruthless rehearsals and dedication to musical perfection. As a conductor Berglund often went beyond the printed score in the music of Jean Sibelius and others to improve on what he believed were weaknesses, especially in orchestration, colour and balance.

Most orchestras he conducted responded well to his no-nonsense approach. He was tireless in studying, preparing and rehearsing. He almost always came to the orchestra with his own materials he had corrected and bowed by his own hand. He would then mark highly detailed instructions on the sheet music of each individual musician.

Berglund would certainly not always agree with composers; he felt comfortable in elaborating any nuances he considered important but which the composers had not highlighted. He believed in details: &quot;I think we have already had our fill of mushy recordings&quot;, Berglund noted in an interview by &quot;Finnish Music Quarterly&quot; (FMQ) in 1999.

In the UK, Berglund led Sibelius Centenary Concerts with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 1965, and became their principal conductor in 1972, concluding his tenure in Bournemouth in 1979. He significantly raised its performing standards, as can be heard from the many recordings made by it for EMI during this period. He also served as principal guest conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra, from 1981–85.

Berglund resigned from both the Helsinki and Bournemouth orchestras in 1979. More noticed in his native Finland was the fact that he had seemed to give up his dictatorial ways. In 1996, he was quoted as saying, &quot;The rise in the standard of Finnish orchestras has been quite incredible...young musicians play so much better than their predecessors did.&quot;

Guest engagements saw him conducting all the major North American and European orchestras, such as the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle, the St Petersburg and Moscow Philharmonics, the Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestras.

Berglund was a member of the Russian National Orchestra&#x27;s conductor collegium.

He made his New York debut in 1978 with the American Symphony Orchestra at the Carnegie Hall, in a concert of Shostakovich and Sibelius. From the 1990s he became a regular guest conductor in the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland Orchestra.

Berglund made over 100 recordings. In an interview for the newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; in 2009, he said when asked about his recordings, that the Smetana recording with the Dresden Staatskapelle is probably the best, since this was the best of the orchestras that he made recordings with.

Berglund conducted opera a few times. The most important of his opera projects were Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; with Finnish National Opera in Helsinki in 2000 (with Karita Mattila, Matti Salminen, Jaakko Ryhänen) and Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Maskerade&quot; in Copenhagen.

Paavo Berglund told in a radio interview for the conductor Atso Almila, made on occasion for the 75th anniversary in 2002 of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, that he had the closest relation and friendship of contemporary Finnish composers to Joonas Kokkonen (1921–1996). The collaboration was very strong. He championed his music as much as possible and also helped him during the difficult times in life. He commissioned many of Kokkonen&#x27;s works.

Berglund was also the first conductor in the early years, alongside Jukka-Pekka Saraste, for the Finnish Chamber Orchestra founded in 1990. The orchestra does not serve as a primary job for anyone, but rather as an instrument to gather top musicians to work together in an exquisite ensemble where art and quality come before routine.

The orchestra consists of concertmasters and principals from leading Finnish orchestras such as the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra of the Finnish National Opera, Tapiola Sinfonietta, Avanti! and Lahti Symphony Orchestra. Berglund also conducted the Sibelius Academy Symphony Orchestra on a few occasions.

==Relationship with Jean Sibelius&#x27; music==
Berglund was particularly associated with the music of Sibelius and he recorded the complete Sibelius symphonies three times.

During the mid-1950s, Jean Sibelius heard Berglund conduct some of the symphonies and the Suite &quot;Rakastava&quot;, and told Berglund how much he had enjoyed the performances. He met Sibelius at his home Ainola as a member of the delegation of the Radio Orchestra that visited Sibelius. Sibelius asked him whether they were playing any Schönberg. To this Paavo Berglund answered no. This was the whole conversation. Berglund made the first recording of the &quot;Kullervo Symphony&quot;.

Berglund&#x27;s source-critical research on the Sibelius Seventh Symphony began in 1957, when he conducted the Seventh with the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, and noticed that they were playing from parts that Sibelius had corrected. He saw that the printed parts had numerous errors. His subsequent research led to the publication of a new edition of the symphony by Hansen in 1980.

In an interview in 1998 with the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Berglund spoke of his interpretative ideas on the music of Jean Sibelius:&quot;Sibelius&#x27;s music is often ruined because it&#x27;s too strictly accurate. I think maybe musicians like to play like this&quot; – he makes a series of downward vertical gestures – &quot;but it&#x27;s good to do it like this&quot; – his hands, one above the other, oscillate gently in and out of vertical alignment. &quot;Accuracy against atmosphere: it&#x27;s not that simple. The early Sibelius conductor Georg Schneevoigt once complained that he couldn&#x27;t get the details out of Sibelius&#x27;s scores. Sibelius said that he should simply swim in the gravy.&quot;

Berglund sometimes courted controversy with his re-touching of orchestral parts; as he said in a &quot;Gramophone&quot; interview in October 1978, &quot;Sibelius was a superb orchestrator, but right up to the very end he made strange dynamics which I find I have to change. In the Second Symphony you don&#x27;t have to alter so much, but funnily enough there is a lot that needs altering in the Seventh Symphony ... My attitude was &quot;&quot; which in German means roughly &#x27;be true to the work&#x27;. But you see, the composers didn&#x27;t always know; they could have given it more thought. Bruckner, when things were suggested to him by Lowe and Schalk (who were certainly not stupid) told them to go ahead and do it. Maybe he was weak and should have argued sometimes a little bit more, but on the other hand many of their suggestions are fine.&quot;

He collaborated with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in recordings of the complete symphonies of Jean Sibelius and Johannes Brahms. The origin for the Sibelius recordings were made when Berglund conducted the orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival in a complete cycle of the Sibelius symphonies. What was especially notable was using smaller string forces than usual in some of the symphonies. The result was highly praised.

Berglund&#x27;s early Sibelius interpretations are darker and heavier. Later on he discovered a new style. While other conductors often go for the big effects in Sibelius, Berglund started to love the clarity that could be achieved with an orchestra of about 50 players.

Berglund was one of the jury members in the 1st International Sibelius Conductors&#x27; Competition held in 1995.

==Last performance==

Paavo Berglund conducted his last concert in the Pleyel Concert Hall in Paris on 1 June 2007. The orchestra was the French Radio Philharmonic Orchestra. The program included the Brahms Violin Concerto with Christian Tetzlaff as a soloist and Sibelius&#x27; Symphony No. 4.

In an interview made on his 80th birthday by the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE, Berglund said that the playing in the Sibelius was almost perfect Sibelius playing. The concert was recorded by French Radio.
==Death and legacy==
Berglund died on 25 January 2012, aged 82, and was buried in Helsinki on 4 February 2012. He was survived by his wife, Kirsti; son, Juha; daughters, Liisa Kylmänen and Eeva Berglund; and five grandchildren.

The Finnish newspaper &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; interviewed the conductor Kurt Masur by telephone from Leipzig on occasion of the passing of Berglund. &quot;Paavo was one of my oldest friends. The world has lost one of its greatest conductors, and my thoughts are with his wife Kirsti and his family&quot;, said Mr Masur.

==Selected instruments==

In 2005, the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation bought a violin from Mr Berglund, which was built in 1732 by Carlo Bergonzi (1683–1747). Before him the violin was owned by Isaac Stern. Violin maker Ilkka Vainio has said that the violin is an example of a masterpiece, the best he has personally known. The violin has maintained its original condition, even the lacquer is still mostly intact. According to Petteri Iivonen, who has played the instrument, the violin has a warm sound yet can endure even a rougher style of play. The violin is lent to a musician for three years at a time. The first was Pietari Inkinen who had the violin during years 2005 to 2009.

In spring 2009, the violin was handed over to Petteri Iivonen. The foundation lends the violin by announcing it on the daily newspapers, musical publications and on its website. Interested musicians may apply to enjoy the violin for the said period of time. A knowledgeable jury decides on the musician who will have the violin.

According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE, Berglund&#x27;s Stradivarius violin was sold by his heirs in 2012 to the Finnish Cultural Foundation for 1.8 million euros. At the same time the performing artist&#x27;s rights to Berglund&#x27;s recordings as well as his valuable collection of orchestral sheet music were donated to the foundation. The latter material will be made available to researchers in ten years&#x27; time. The violin will be named Stradivarius ex. Berglund. Mr Berglund&#x27;s son Juha Berglund, the spokesperson for the family, says that his father had several instruments, but the Stradivari was the dearest to him. Mr Berglund&#x27;s specific wish was that the violin should stay in Finland. The violin was built in around 1700. The violin is in exceptionally good condition for its age.

<text>A barquentine or schooner barque (alternatively &quot;barkentine&quot; or &quot;schooner bark&quot;) is a sailing vessel with three or more masts; with a square rigged foremast and fore-and-aft rigged main, mizzen and any other masts.

==Modern barquentine sailing rig==
While a full-rigged ship is square-rigged on all three masts, and the barque is square-rigged except for the mizzen-mast, the barquentine extends the principle by making only the foremast square-rigged. The advantages of a smaller crew, good performance before the wind and the ability to sail relatively close to the wind while carrying plenty of cargo made it a popular rig at the end of the nineteenth century.

Today, barquentines are popular with modern tall ship and sail training operators as their suite of mainly fore-and-aft sails improve non-downwind performance, while their foremast of square sails offers long distance downwind speed and dramatic appearance in port.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;barquentine&quot; is seventeenth-century in origin, formed from &quot;barque&quot; in imitation of &quot;brigantine&quot;, a two-masted vessel square-rigged only on the forward mast, and apparently formed from the word brig.

==Historic and modern examples==
* &quot;City of New York&quot;, an arctic sailing ship.
* , a sail training ship that capsized and sank on 17 February 2010.
* of Indonesian Navy, launched and commissioned in 1953, a well-known tall ship used for cadet training and ambassador of the sea, sails around the world and visits many countries.
* &#x27;New Endeavour&#x27;, a Danish built three masted schooner launched in 1919 in Svendborg as &quot;Dana&quot;, in 1968 the rig was altered to barquentine and the ship featured prominently in the Australian TV series Barrier Reef. It was scrapped by fire in the dry dock in Ballina, NSW, due to the inability to raise the required money (about $300,000) to make her seaworthy.
* , commanded by Ernest Shackleton and crushed by ice in the Weddell Sea during the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17.
* , a sail training ship of the Chilean Navy.

* Many smaller ships of the late nineteenth century Royal Navy were rigged as barquentines, including the s.
* &quot;Southern Swan&quot;, tall ship from 1922 re-rigged as a barquentine from its original rigging as a schooner. Sails on Sydney Harbour for cruises.

<doc id="620600" wikidata="Q770348" url="?curid=620600" title="Ranulf Higden">
<text>Ranulf Higden or Higdon (–1363 or 1364) was an English chronicler and a Benedictine monk who wrote the &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, a Late Medieval magnum opus. Higden resided at the monastery of St. Werburgh in Chester after taking his monastic vow at Benedictine Abbey in Chester in 1299. Later in life he travelled to visit and counsel with King Edward III. Higden&#x27;s remains are buried in Chester Cathedral. 

Higden wrote many works, including the &quot;Polychronicon, Ars componendi sermones,&quot; and &quot;Speculum curatorum.&quot; Higden began compiling the &quot;Polychronicon,&quot; a seven-book series about world history written in Latin&quot;,&quot; during the reign of Edward III. He is sometimes associated with the Chester Plays, but there is also doubt surrounding this association. &quot;Ars componendi sermones&quot; and &quot;Speculum curatorum&quot; address religious topics. 

==Biography==
Ranulf Higden was born in about 1280 and is believed to have been born in the West of England. He joined St. Werburgh abbey in Chester, England in 1299. There, he may have worked in the abbey library and managed its scriptorium. He was also a preacher and taught other preachers. Already a known historian, Higden was invited to visit Edward III in August of 1352; during this visit he was under direction to bring &quot;Polychronicon&quot; and speak with the king&#x27;s council. Higden was a part of the abbey for 64 years until his death. His death has been said to be between 1363 and 1364; in March 1363; on March 12, 1364; sometime during 1364; or around the feast of St. Gregory. He is buried in Chester Cathedral. 

== His works ==

=== &quot;Polychronicon&quot; ===
Higden authored a chronicle commonly called &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, which name comes from the longer title &quot;Ranulphi Castrensis, cognomine Higden, Polychronicon (sive Historia Polycratica) ab initio mundi usque ad mortem regis Edwardi III in septem libros dispositum&quot;. The work is divided into seven books, in imitation of the seven days of Genesis, and, with exception of the first book, is a summary of general history. V. H. Galbraith described it as &#x27;the most exhaustive universal history produced in medieval times and...the best seller of its age.&#x27; It belonged to St. Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey during Higden&#x27;s lifetime and was kept in the monastic library until the abbey shut down in 1540. 

The first book consists of 60 chapters and provides a geographical survey of the world. It starts with a prologue and a list of sourced authors. Its content covers Asia, Africa and Europe and concludes with several chapters describing Great Britain. It relates events from the Creation to Nebuchadnezzar (Book 2); the birth of Christ (Book 3); the arrival of the Saxons in England (Book 4); the arrival of the Danes in England (Book 5); the Norman Conquest (Book 6); and the reign of Edward III (Book 7). The first letters of each chapter create the acrostic &quot;presentem cronicam conpilavit Frater Ranulphus Cestrensis monachis&quot;.

E. Barber, who was the Archdeacon of Chester, described the text as a &#x27;pleasant, easy-going Universal History&#x27; but not &#x27;critical or scientific, or really historical.&#x27; While some people thought that Higden&#x27;s writing was plagiarised from a man named Roger Higden, Edward Maunde Thompson thought that Roger Higden could have been the same person as Ranulf Higden. Francis J. Haverfield also acknowledged the possibility, but also thought that &#x27;Higden was a great plagiarist&#x27; ; he wrote that plagiarising was not unusual for histories produced in Higden&#x27;s time. Higden may have written the work to 1340 or 1342, later adding content up to 1352 or 1355 and perhaps beyond. Later, &quot;Polychronicon&quot; was extended to 1387.

John Trevisa translated the text into English in 1387. Another translation was written by an anonymous writer in the 15th. century. Trevisa&#x27;s version was revised and printed by Caxton in 1482, who added an eighth book containing content up to 1467.One section in Book 1 from the Latin text was published in a compilation assembled by Thomas Gale in 1691. The &quot;Polychronicon&quot; was a well-known text in the years it was reprinted and revised. The &quot;Polychronicon&quot; was edited for the Rolls Series and included the English translations as well as extensions of the history. This edition was criticised by Mandell Creighton, who wrote that the editing was done in a &#x27;perfunctory manner&#x27; and that the additions to the &quot;Polychronicon&quot; added little to the history. There are over 100 copies of the Latin or English versions held by libraries in the UK, Belgium, Ireland, the USA, France, Spain, and the Vatican City.
=== Chester Plays ===
Over time, after Higden’s death the Chester Plays were attributed to him with possible variations of his name. One of the name variations, Randal Higgenet, may not be the same person as Ranulf Higden, according to A. W. Pollard and Thomas Warton. Higden’s contemporaries, Joseph C. Bridge says, made no mention of Higden writing the plays. One argument, made by author John Taylor, against Higden as the author of the plays is that the plays are written in English; most literature at the time was usually in French or Latin, and Benedictine monks translated other types of documents into English.

=== Other works ===

==== &quot;Ars componendi sermones&quot; ====
In &quot;Ars componendi sermones&quot; Higden outlines the qualities a preacher should have and describes Christ using several metaphors. Popular in the 14th. century, this text guides preachers on how to choose and write sermons, as well as gives sermon suggestions for different occasions. A recent translation of &quot;Ars componendi sermones&quot;, done by Margaret Jennings and Sally A. Wilson, was published in 2003.

==== &quot;Speculum curatorum&quot; ====
In &quot;Speculum curatorum&quot; Higden writes about a variety of topics, including Christ’s teachings in the New Testament and divination. Much of the text is compiled from &quot;De Universo&quot; and &quot;De Legibus&quot; by William of Auvergne; in this text, Higden’s sourced authors go uncited. After writing the text, Higden expanded it. V. H. Galbraith wrote that &quot;Speculum curatorum&quot; as well as Higden’s other theological writings are ‘of no great distinction.’

<text>The Fairey Fox was a British light bomber and fighter biplane of the 1920s and 1930s. It was originally produced in Britain for the RAF, but continued in production and use in Belgium long after it was retired in Britain.

==Development and design==

===Fox I===
In 1923, Charles Richard Fairey, founder and chief designer of Fairey Aviation, disappointed with his Fawn bomber, which owing to the constraints of Air Ministry specifications, was slower than the Airco DH.9A which it was meant to replace while carrying no greater bombload, conceived the idea of a private venture bomber not subject to official limitations, which could demonstrate superior performance and handling. On seeing the Curtiss CR, powered by a Curtiss D-12 V-12 liquid-cooled engine of low frontal area and in a low drag installation, win the 1923 Schneider Trophy race, Fairey realised that this engine would be well suited to a new bomber and acquired an example of the engine and a licence for production.

Fairey began design of a bomber around this engine, with detailed design carried out by a team at first led by Frank Duncanson and then by the Belgian Marcel Lobelle. The resultant aircraft, the Fairey Fox, was a single-bay biplane with highly staggered wings, with a composite wood and metal structure. The Curtiss D-12 was installed in a closely cowled tractor installation, with one radiator mounted on the underside of the upper wing, and a second retractable radiator that could be wound in and out of the fuselage as required. Pilot and gunner sat close together in two tandem cockpits, with the gunner armed with a Lewis gun on a specially designed high-speed gun mounting that allowed the gun to be stowed to reduce drag, with the pilot armed with a single synchronised Vickers machine gun. Up to of bombs could be carried under the wings, aimed by the gunner whose seat folded to allow use of a bombsight.

The prototype Fox first flew at RAF Hendon on 3 January 1925, piloted by Norman Macmillan, quickly demonstrating good performance and handling. Despite this, there was much resistance to the new bomber within the Air Ministry, with the Fox not designed to an official specification and having several features, such as fuel tanks within the fuselage, that went against official norm, and most importantly, it featured an American engine. However, on seeing the prototype Fox being demonstrated on 28 July 1925, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Trenchard, the Chief of the Air Staff, announced that &quot;Mr Fairey, I have decided to order a squadron of these machines&quot;, thus shortcutting official channels, an initial order for 18 Foxes following.

===Second generation Foxes===
In 1926 the Air Ministry drew up Specification 12/26 for a new light-bomber for the Royal Air Force. Unlike previous specifications, high performance was stressed, and many of the overly prescriptive requirements which had previously limited performance removed. At first, Fairey was not informed of the new specification, and only received a copy after protesting to the Air Ministry. To meet the requirement, Lobelle&#x27;s team designed the Fox IIM, effectively an all-new aircraft with a metal structure as demanded by the Specification, and powered by a Rolls-Royce F.XIB (later named the Rolls-Royce Kestrel. It first flew on 25 October 1929. The competing Hawker Hart and Avro Antelope prototypes had been flying for over a year by this time, and the Hart had received an initial production order in June 1929. Although the Fox IIM was not wanted by the RAF, Fairey demonstrated it to the Belgian Air Force, which wanted a light bomber to replace its Breguet 19s and had already bought Fairey Firefly II fighters from Fairey which had also set up a Belgian subsidiary, Avions Fairey, to build the Firefly. The Fox IIM was successful, winning an initial order for 12 Fox II reconnaissance aircraft to be built in England, with further production to come from Avions Fairey.

==Operational history==

The Fox entered service with No. 12 Squadron RAF in June 1926. The Fox proved to have spectacular performance, being 50 mph (80 km/h) faster than the Fairey Fawns that it replaced in 12 Squadron, and as fast as contemporary fighters. Such was the performance of the Fox that 12 Squadron was instructed to fly no faster than 140 mph (225 km/h) during annual Air Defence Exercises in order to give the defending fighters a chance. Despite this, no further RAF squadrons were equipped with the Fox, and only 28 were purchased in total, with later aircraft being powered by the Kestrel engine and surviving Curtiss engined aircraft being re-fitted with the Kestrel. 12 Squadron, which later adopted a fox&#x27;s mask as squadron badge in memory of their sole usage of the aircraft, remained equipped with the Fox until 1931, being finally replaced by the Hawker Hart. Foxes remained in use as dual control trainers at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell until 1933.

Two superannuated Fox Mk.Is took part in the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne. One of them occasioned the only fatalities of the race when it crashed in Italy. The other, commanded by Australian Ray Parer (a veteran of the 1919 England to Australia Air Race), had struggled no further than Paris when news came through that the race winner had completed the course. Parer and co-pilot Geoff Hemsworth continued an epic and eventful journey, taking nearly four months to reach Melbourne.

The first Fox IIs entered service with the Belgian Air Force in early 1932 as a reconnaissance aircraft, with one winning the &quot;Circuit of the Alps&quot; race for two-seat military aircraft at the 1932 Zurich Aviation meeting. The Fox continued in production at Avions Fairey at Gosselies for much of the 1930s, forming the backbone of the Belgian Air Force, being used as reconnaissance, reconnaissance-bomber and two-seater fighters. Later aircraft were fitted with enclosed canopies and more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Y engines.

Over 100 Foxes were still in front-line service with the Belgian Air Force at the time of the German invasion on 10 May 1940. Although massively outclassed by the aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; they flew about 75 sorties and even claimed one kill of a Messerschmitt Bf 109.

<text> () was an heavy cruiser, the third of a class of five vessels. She served with Nazi Germany&#x27;s during World War II. The ship was laid down in April 1936, launched in August 1938, and entered service after the outbreak of war, in August 1940. She was named after Prince Eugene of Savoy, a distinguished 18th-century general in the service of the Holy Roman Empire. She was armed with a main battery of eight guns and, although nominally under the limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, actually displaced over .

 saw action during Operation Rheinübung, an attempted breakout into the Atlantic Ocean with the battleship in May 1941. The two ships destroyed the British battlecruiser and moderately damaged the battleship in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. was detached from during the operation to raid Allied merchant shipping, but this was cut short due to engine troubles. After putting into occupied France and undergoing repairs, the ship participated in Operation Cerberus, a daring daylight dash through the English Channel back to Germany. In February 1942, was deployed to Norway, although her time stationed there was curtailed when she was torpedoed by the British submarine days after arriving in Norwegian waters. The torpedo severely damaged the ship&#x27;s stern, which necessitated repairs in Germany.

Upon returning to active service, the ship spent several months training officer cadets in the Baltic before serving as artillery support for the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front. After the German collapse in May 1945, she was surrendered to the British Royal Navy before being transferred to the US Navy as a war prize. After examining the ship in the United States, the US Navy assigned the cruiser to the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Having survived the atomic blasts, was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she ultimately capsized and sank in December 1946. The wreck remains partially visible above the water approximately two miles northwest of Bucholz Army Airfield, on the edge of Enubuj. One of her screw propellers was salvaged and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany.

== Design ==

The of heavy cruisers was ordered in the context of German naval rearmament after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and repudiated the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, Germany signed the Anglo–German Naval Agreement with Great Britain, which provided a legal basis for German naval rearmament; the treaty specified that Germany would be able to build five &quot;treaty cruisers&quot;. The s were nominally within the 10,000-ton limit, though they significantly exceeded the figure.

 was long overall, and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . After launching, her straight bow was replaced with a clipper bow, increasing the length overall to . The new bow kept her foredeck much drier in heavy weather. The ship had a design displacement of and a full-load displacement of . was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated for a top speed of from . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men.

The ship&#x27;s primary armament was eight SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve L/65 guns, twelve guns, and eight guns. The ship also carried four triple torpedo launchers. For aerial reconnaissance, she was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. ″s armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick and her main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides.

== Service history ==
 was ordered by the from the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel. Her keel was laid down on 23 April 1936, under construction number 564 and the contract name &quot; J&quot;. She was originally to be named after Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the Austrian victor of the Battle of Lissa, though considerations over the possible insult to Italy, defeated by Tegetthoff at Lissa, led the Kriegsmarine to adopt Prinz Eugen as the ship&#x27;s namesake. She was launched on 22 August 1938, in a ceremony attended by the Governor () of the Ostmark, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who made the christening speech. Also present at the launch were Adolf Hitler, the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy (who had commanded the battleship from 24 November 1917 to 1 March 1918), and his wife Magdolna Purgly, who performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.

Commissioning was delayed slightly due to light damage sustained during a Royal Air Force attack on Kiel on the night of 1 July 1940. suffered two relatively light hits in the attack, but she was not seriously damaged and was commissioned into service on 1 August. The cruiser spent the remainder of 1940 conducting sea trials in the Baltic Sea. In early 1941, the ship&#x27;s artillery crews conducted gunnery training. A short period in dry dock for final modifications and improvements followed. In April, the ship joined the newly commissioned battleship for maneuvers in the Baltic. The two ships had been selected for Operation Rheinübung, a breakout into the Atlantic to raid Allied commerce.

On 23 April, while passing through the Fehmarn Belt en route to Kiel, detonated a magnetic mine dropped by British aircraft. The mine damaged the fuel tank, propeller shaft couplings, and fire control equipment. The planned sortie with was delayed while repairs were carried out. Admirals Erich Raeder and Günther Lütjens discussed the possibility of delaying the operation further, in the hopes that repairs to the battleship would be completed or ″s sistership would complete trials in time for the ships to join and . Raeder and Lütjens decided that it would be most beneficial to resume surface actions in the Atlantic as soon as possible, however, and that the two ships should sortie without reinforcement.

=== Operation Rheinübung ===
By 11 May 1941, repairs to had been completed. Under the command of (KzS—Captain at Sea) Helmuth Brinkmann, the ship steamed to Gotenhafen, where the crew readied her for her Atlantic sortie. On 18 May, rendezvoused with off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around 13:00 on 20 May, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish cruiser ; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the Kattegat. transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: &quot;Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10–12 aircraft passed Marstrand, course 205°/20&#x27;.&quot; The (OKM—Naval High Command) was not concerned about the security risk posed by , though Lütjens believed operational security had been lost. The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attaché to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the Admiralty.

The code-breakers at Bletchley Park confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had decrypted reports that and had taken on prize crews and requested additional navigational charts from headquarters. A pair of Supermarine Spitfires were ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the German flotilla. On the evening of 20 May, and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast. At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft that quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached Bergen and anchored at Grimstadfjord. While there, the ships&#x27; crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard &quot;outboard gray&quot; worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.

While in Bergen, took on of fuel; inexplicably failed to similarly refuel. At 19:30 on 21 May, , , and the three escorting destroyers left port. By midnight, the force was in the open sea and headed toward the Arctic Ocean. At this time, Admiral Raeder finally informed Hitler of the operation, who reluctantly allowed it to continue as planned. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off Trondheim. At around 12:00, Lütjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the breakout into the open waters of the Atlantic.

By 04:00 on 23 May, Lütjens ordered and to increase speed to to make the dash through the Denmark Strait. Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMO radar detection equipment sets. led by about ; mist reduced visibility to . The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to . Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid ice floes. At 19:22, hydrophone and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser at a range of approximately . ″s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by &quot;Suffolk&quot; and learned that their location had indeed been reported.

Admiral Lütjens gave permission for to engage &quot;Suffolk&quot;, though the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held fire. &quot;Suffolk&quot; quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser joined &quot;Suffolk&quot;, but approached the German raiders too closely. Lütjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; fired five salvoes, three of which straddled &quot;Norfolk&quot; and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38 cm guns disabled ″s FuMo 23 radar set; this prompted Lütjens to order to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation. The British cruisers tracked and through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships.

====Battle of the Denmark Strait====

The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07 that morning, hydrophone operators aboard detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of , reporting &quot;Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280° relative bearing!&quot;. At 05:45, lookouts on the German ships spotted smoke on the horizon; these turned out to be from and , under the command of Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland. Lütjens ordered his ships&#x27; crews to battle stations. By 05:52, the range had fallen to and &quot;Hood&quot; opened fire, followed by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; a minute later. &quot;Hood&quot; engaged , which the British thought to be , while &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; fired on .

The British ships approached the Germans head on, which permitted them to use only their forward guns, while and could fire full broadsides. Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20° turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on &quot;Hood&quot;. About a minute after opening fire, scored a hit with a high-explosive 20.3 cm shell, detonating unrotated projectile ammunition and starting a large fire on &quot;Hood&quot;, which was quickly extinguished. Holland then ordered a second 20° turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with and . By this time, had found the range to &quot;Hood&quot;, so Lütjens ordered to shift fire and target &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, scored a pair of hits on the battleship and reported that a small fire had been started.

Lütjens then ordered to drop behind , so she could continue to monitor the location of &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;, which were still some to the east. At 06:00, &quot;Hood&quot; was completing her second turn to port when ″s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38 cm armor-piercing shells struck &quot;Hood&quot; and penetrated her thin upper belt armor. The shell reached &quot;Hood&quot;″s rear ammunition magazine and detonated of cordite propellant. The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle. The stern similarly rose upward as water rushed into the ripped-open compartments. After only eight minutes of firing, &quot;Hood&quot; had disappeared, taking all but three of her crew of 1,419 men with her.

After a few more minutes, during which &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; scored three hits on , the damaged British battleship withdrew. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened, though Captain Ernst Lindemann, ″s commander, strongly advocated chasing &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and destroying her. Lütjens firmly rejected the request, and instead ordered and to head for the open waters of the North Atlantic. After the end of the engagement, Lütjens reported that a &quot;Battlecruiser, probably &quot;Hood&quot;, sunk. Another battleship, &quot;King George V&quot; or &quot;Renown&quot;, turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact.&quot; At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach for commerce raiding and to make for St. Nazaire for repairs. Shortly after 10:00, Lütjens ordered to fall behind to discern the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming &quot;broad streams of oil on both sides of [″s] wake&quot;, returned to the forward position.

====Separation and return to France====
With the weather worsening, Lütjens attempted to detach at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker&#x27;s cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. turned around to face Wake-Walker&#x27;s formation, forcing &quot;Suffolk&quot; to turn away at high speed. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; fired twelve salvos at , which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted to slip away.

On 26 May, rendezvoused with the supply ship to refill her nearly empty fuel tanks. She had by then only 160 tons fuel left, enough for a day. Afterwards the ship continued further south on a mission against shipping lines. Before any merchant ship was found, defects in her engines showed and on 27 May, the day was sunk, she was ordered to give up her mission and make for a port in occupied France. On 28 May refueled from the tanker . The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her maximum speed to 28 knots. The screw problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area (at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship&#x27;s radio crew) reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.

=== Operation Cerberus and Norwegian operations ===


Brest is not far from airfields in southern England and during their stay in Brest and the battleships and were repeatedly attacked by Allied bombers. The Royal Air Force jokingly referred to the three ships as the Brest Bomb Target Flotilla, and between 1 August and 31 December 1941 it dropped some 1200 tons of bombs on the port. On the night of 1 July 1941, was struck by an armor-piercing bomb that destroyed the control center deep down under the bridge. The attack killed 60 men and wounded more than 40 others. The loss of the control center also made the main guns useless and repairs lasted until the end of the year.

The continuous air attacks led the German command to decide , and would have to move to safer bases as soon as they were repaired and ready. Meanwhile, the operation had demonstrated the risks of operating in the Atlantic without air cover. In addition, Hitler saw the Norwegian theater as the &quot;zone of destiny&quot;, so he ordered the three ships&#x27; return to Germany in early 1942 so they could be deployed there. The intention was to use the ships to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, as well as to strengthen the defenses of Norway. Hitler insisted they would make the voyage via the English Channel, despite Raeder&#x27;s protests that it was too risky. Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax was given command of the operation. In early February, minesweepers swept a route through the Channel, though the British failed to detect the activity.

At 23:00 on 11 February, , , and left Brest. They entered the Channel an hour later; the three ships sped at , hugging the French coast along the voyage. By 06:30, they had passed Cherbourg, at which point they were joined by a flotilla of torpedo boats. The torpedo boats were led by Erich Bey, aboard the destroyer . (General of Fighter Force) Adolf Galland directed Luftwaffe fighter and bomber forces (Operation Donnerkeil) during Cerberus. The fighters flew at masthead-height to avoid detection by the British radar network. Liaison officers were present on all three ships. By 13:00, the ships had cleared the Strait of Dover but, half an hour later, a flight of six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, with Spitfire escort, attacked the Germans. The British failed to penetrate the Luftwaffe fighter shield, and all six Swordfish were destroyed.

Off Dover, came under fire from British coastal artillery batteries, though they scored no hits. Several Motor Torpedo Boats then attacked the ship, but ″s destroyer escorts drove the vessels off before they could launch their torpedoes. At 16:43, encountered five British destroyers: , , , , and . She fired her main battery at them and scored several hits on &quot;Worcester&quot;, but she was forced to maneuver erratically to avoid their torpedoes. Nevertheless, arrived in Brunsbüttel on the morning of 13 February, completely undamaged, but suffering the only casualty in all three big ships, killed by aircraft gunfire.

On 21 February 1942, , the heavy cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , and steamed to Norway. After stopping briefly in Grimstadfjord, the ships proceeded on to Trondheim. Two days later, while patrolling off the Trondheimsfjord, the British submarine torpedoed . The torpedo struck the ship in the stern, killing fifty men, causing serious damage, and rendering the ship unmaneuverable. However, on her own power she managed to reach Trondheim and from there was towed to , where, over the next few months, emergency repairs were effected. Her entire stern was cut away and plated over and two jury-rigged rudders, operated manually by capstans, were installed.

On 16 May, made the return voyage to Germany under her own power. While en route to Kiel, the ship was attacked by a British force of 19 Bristol Blenheim bombers and 27 Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers commanded by Wing Commander Mervyn Williams, though the aircraft failed to hit the ship. was out of service for repairs until October; she conducted sea trials beginning on 27 October. Hans-Erich Voss, who later became Hitler&#x27;s Naval Liaison Officer, was given command of the ship when she returned to service. In reference to her originally planned name, the ship&#x27;s bell from the Austrian battleship was presented on 22 November by the Italian (Rear Admiral) de Angeles. Over the course of November and December, the ship was occupied with lengthy trials in the Baltic. In early January 1943, the ordered the ship to return to Norway to reinforce the warships stationed there. Twice in January attempted to steam to Norway with , but both attempts were broken off after British surveillance aircraft spotted the two ships. After it became apparent that it would be impossible to move the ship to Norway, was assigned to the Fleet Training Squadron. For nine months, she cruised the Baltic training cadets.

=== Service in the Baltic ===
As the Soviet Army pushed the Wehrmacht back on the Eastern Front, it became necessary to reactivate as a gunnery support vessel; on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty. In June 1944, , the heavy cruiser , and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla formed the Second Task Force, later renamed Task Force Thiele after its commander, August Thiele. was at this time under the command of &quot;KzS&quot; Hans-Jürgen Reinicke, and she served as Thiele&#x27;s flagship. Throughout June she steamed in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of Utö as a show of force during the German withdrawal from Finland. On 19–20 August, the ship steamed into the Gulf of Riga and bombarded Tukums. Four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported the action, along with ″s Ar 196 floatplanes; the cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery. ″s bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.

In early September, supported a failed attempt to seize the fortress island of Hogland. The ship then returned to Gotenhafen, before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating German soldiers from Finland. The convoy, consisting of six freighters, sailed on 15 September from the Gulf of Bothnia, with the entire Second Task Force escorting it. Swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed the convoy, but did not intervene. The following month, returned to gunfire support duties. On 11 and 12 October, she fired in support of German troops in Memel. Over the first two days, the ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her main battery. She returned on the 14th and 15th, after having restocked her main battery ammunition, to fire another 370 rounds.

While on the return voyage to Gotenhafen on 15 October, inadvertently rammed the light cruiser amidships north of Hela. The cause of the collision was heavy fog. The light cruiser was nearly cut in half, and the two ships remained wedged together for fourteen hours. was taken to Gotenhafen, where repairs were effected within a month. Sea trials commenced on 14 November. On 20–21 November, the ship supported German troops on the Sworbe Peninsula by firing around 500 rounds of main battery ammunition. Four torpedo boats—&quot;T13&quot;, &quot;T16&quot;, &quot;T19&quot;, and &quot;T21&quot;—joined the operation. then returned to Gotenhafen to resupply and have her worn-out gun barrels re-bored.
The cruiser was ready for action by mid-January 1945, when she was sent to bombard Soviet forces in Samland. The ship fired 871 rounds of ammunition at the Soviets advancing on the German bridgehead at Cranz held by the XXVIII Corps, which was protecting Königsberg. She was supported in this operation by the destroyer &quot;Z25&quot; and torpedo boat . At that point, had expended her main battery ammunition, and critical munition shortages forced the ship to remain in port until 10 March, when she bombarded Soviet forces around Gotenhafen, Danzig, and Hela. During these operations, she fired a total of 2,025 shells from her 20.3 cm guns and another 2,446 rounds from her 10.5 cm guns. The old battleship also provided gunfire support, as did after 25 March. The ships were commanded by Bernhard Rogge.

The following month, on 8 April, and steamed to Swinemünde. On 13 April, 34 Lancaster bombers attacked the two ships while in port. Thick cloud cover forced the British to abort the mission and return two days later. On the second attack, they succeeded in sinking with a single Tallboy bomb hit. then departed Swinemünde for Copenhagen, arriving on 20 April. Once there, she was decommissioned on 7 May and turned over to Royal Navy control the following day. For his leadership of in the final year of the war, Reinicke was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 21 April 1945. During her operational career with the , lost 115 crew members; 79 men were killed in action, 33 were killed in accidents and three died of other causes. Of these 115 crew members, four were officers, seven were cadets or ensigns, two were petty officers, 22 were junior petty officers, 78 were sailors and two were civilians.

=== Service with the United States Navy ===

On 27 May 1945, and the light cruiser —the only major German naval vessels to survive the war in serviceable condition—were escorted by the British cruisers and to Wilhelmshaven. On 13 December, was awarded as a war prize to the United States, which sent the ship to Wesermünde. The United States did not particularly want the cruiser, but it did want to prevent the Soviet Union from acquiring it. Her US commander, Captain Arthur H. Graubart, recounted later how the British, Soviet and US representatives in the Control Commission all claimed the ship and how in the end the various large prizes were divided in three lots, being one of them. The three lots were then drawn lottery style from his hat with the British and Soviet representatives drawing the lots for other ships and Graubart being left with the lot for . The cruiser was commissioned into the US Navy as the unclassified miscellaneous vessel USS with the hull number IX-300. A composite American-German crew consisting of 574 German officers and sailors, supervised by eight American officers and eighty-five enlisted men under the command of Graubart, then took the ship to Boston, departing on 13 January 1946 and arriving on 22 January.

After arriving in Boston, the ship was extensively examined by the US Navy. Her very large GHG passive sonar array was removed and installed on the submarine for testing. American interest in magnetic amplifier technology increased again after findings in investigations of the fire control system of . The guns from turret Anton were removed while in Philadelphia in February. On 1 May the German crewmen left the ship and returned to Germany. Thereafter, the American crew had significant difficulties in keeping the ship&#x27;s propulsion system operational—eleven of her twelve boilers failed after the Germans departed. The ship was then allocated to the fleet of target ships for Operation Crossroads in Bikini Atoll. Operation Crossroads was a major test of the effects of nuclear weapons on warships of various types. The trouble with ″s propulsion system may have influenced the decision to dispose of her in the nuclear tests.

She was towed to the Pacific via Philadelphia and the Panama Canal, departing on 3 March. The ship survived two atomic bomb blasts: Test Able, an air burst on 1 July 1946 and Test Baker, a submerged detonation on 25 July. was moored about from the epicenter of both blasts and was only lightly damaged by them; the Able blast only bent her foremast and broke the top of her main mast. She suffered no significant structural damage from the explosions but was thoroughly contaminated with radioactive fallout. The ship was towed to the Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific, where a small leak went unrepaired due to the radiation danger. On 29 August 1946, the US Navy decommissioned .

By late December 1946, the ship was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy attempted to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship&#x27;s stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above the surface of the water. The US government denied salvage rights on the grounds that it did not want the contaminated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship&#x27;s screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship&#x27;s bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from is held in Graz, Austria.

Beginning in 1974, the US government began to warn about the danger of an oil leak from the ship&#x27;s full fuel tanks. The government was concerned about the risk of a severe typhoon damaging the wreck and causing a leak. Starting in February 2018, the US Navy, including the Navy&#x27;s Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One, US Army, and the Marshall Islands conducted a joint oil removal effort with the salvage ship , which had cut holes into the ship&#x27;s fuel tanks to pump the oil from the wreck directly into the oil tanker &quot;Humber&quot;. The US Navy announced that the work had been completed by 15 October 2018; the project had extracted approximately of fuel oil, which amounted to 97 percent of the fuel remaining aboard the wreck. Lieutenant Commander Tim Emge, the officer responsible for the salvage operation, stated that &quot;There are no longer active leaks... the remaining oil is enclosed in a few internal tanks without leakage and encased by layered protection.&quot;

<doc id="620603" wikidata="Q231776" url="?curid=620603" title="Margot Fonteyn">
<text>Dame Margaret Evelyn de Arias DBE ( Hookham; 18 May 191921 February 1991), known by the stage name Margot Fonteyn (), was an English ballerina. She spent her entire career as a dancer with the Royal Ballet (formerly the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Company), eventually being appointed &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; of the company by Queen Elizabeth II.

Beginning ballet lessons at the age of four, she studied in England and China, where her father was transferred for his work. Her training in Shanghai was with Russian expatriate dancer Georgy Goncharov, contributing to her continuing interest in Russian ballet. Returning to London at the age of 14, she was invited to join the Vic-Wells Ballet School by Ninette de Valois. She succeeded Alicia Markova as prima ballerina of the company in 1935. The Vic-Wells choreographer, Sir Frederick Ashton, wrote numerous parts for Fonteyn and her partner, Robert Helpmann, with whom she danced from the 1930s to the 1940s.

In 1946, the company, now renamed the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet, moved into the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden where Fonteyn&#x27;s most frequent partner throughout the next decade was Michael Somes. Her performance in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; became a distinguishing role for both Fonteyn and the company, but she was also well known for the ballets created by Ashton, including &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, &quot;Ondine&quot; and &quot;Sylvia&quot;.

In 1949, she led the company in a tour of the United States and became an international celebrity. Before and after the Second World War, Fonteyn performed in televised broadcasts of ballet performances in Britain and in the early 1950s appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; consequently increasing the popularity of dance in the United States.

In 1955, she married the Panamanian politician Roberto Arias and appeared in a live colour production of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; aired on NBC. Three years later, she and Somes danced for the BBC television adaptation of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. Thanks to her international acclaim and many guest artist requests, the Royal Ballet allowed Fonteyn to become a freelance dancer in 1959.

In 1961, when Fonteyn was considering retirement, Rudolf Nureyev defected from the Kirov Ballet while dancing in Paris. Fonteyn, though reluctant to partner with him because of their 19-year age difference, danced with him in his début with the Royal Ballet in &quot;Giselle&quot; on 21 February 1962. The duo immediately became an international sensation, each dancer pushing the other to their best performances. They were most noted for their classical performances in works such as &quot;Le Corsaire Pas de Deux&quot;, &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and &quot;Raymonda&quot;, in which Nureyev sometimes adapted choreographies specifically to showcase their talents. The pair premièred Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Marguerite and Armand&quot;, which had been choreographed specifically for them, and were noted for their performance in the title roles of Sir Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

The following year, Fonteyn&#x27;s husband was shot during an assassination attempt and became a quadriplegic, requiring constant care for the remainder of his life. In 1972, Fonteyn went into semi-retirement, although she continued to dance periodically until the end of the decade. In 1979, she was fêted by the Royal Ballet and officially pronounced the &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; of the company. She retired to Panama, where she spent her time writing books, raising cattle, and caring for her husband. She died from ovarian cancer exactly 29 years after her premiere with Nureyev in &quot;Giselle&quot;.

==Early life (1919–1934)==
Margaret Evelyn Hookham was born on 18 May 1919 in Reigate, Surrey, to Hilda (&quot;née&quot; Acheson Fontes) and Felix John Hookham. Her father was a British mechanical engineer, who worked for the British-American Tobacco Company. Her mother was the illegitimate daughter of an Irish woman, Evelyn Acheson, and the Brazilian industrialist Antonio Gonçalves Fontes. Hookham had one sibling, her older brother Felix. The family moved to Ealing, where her mother sent her four-year-old daughter with her brother to ballet classes with Grace Bosustow. Her mother accompanied Hookham to her earliest lessons, learning the basic positions alongside her daughter in order to improve her understanding of what a ballet student needed to develop. Over the years, Hilda provided constant support, guidance and critique to her daughter; she became a well-known backstage presence at Hookham&#x27;s performances, earning the nickname &quot;Black Queen&quot; from Hookham&#x27;s teachers and colleagues. While some children might have balked at such overbearing attention from a parent, Hookham accepted her mother&#x27;s help with &quot;affectionate and unembarrassed naturalness&quot;.

In July 1924, at the age of five, Hookham danced in a charity concert and received her first newspaper review: the &quot;Middlesex Country Times&quot; noted that the young dancer had performed &quot;a remarkably fine solo&quot; which had been &quot;vigorously encored&quot; by the audience. Even during her early years, Hookham showed signs of the pressure she felt to succeed in her dancing, often pushing herself physically to avoid becoming a disappointment to others. Whenever a dance exam approached, she became ill with a high fever for several days, recovering just in time to take the test. Hookham&#x27;s father began preparing to move his family abroad for work. It was decided, after consultation, that they would take their daughter with them but leave their son Felix at an English boarding school. For Hookham, this new separation from her sibling was a painful experience. Her father was transferred first to Louisville, Kentucky, where Hookham attended school but did not take ballet lessons, as her mother was skeptical about the quality of the local dance school. When Peggy – as she was called in her childhood – was nine, she and her parents moved to China.

For about a year, the family lived in Tianjin. This was followed by a brief stint in Hong Kong before they moved to Shanghai in 1931, where Hookham studied ballet with the Russian émigré teacher Georgy Goncharov. Goncharov&#x27;s partner Vera Volkova later became influential in Hookham&#x27;s career and training. Hookham had no dreams of becoming a dancer and was a reluctant student, but she was competitive. Having June Brae in her classes pushed her to work harder. She did not like the Cecchetti drills, preferring the fluid expression of the Russian style. Her mother brought her back to London when she was 14, to pursue a ballet career. In 1934, Hookham&#x27;s father wrote from Shanghai, explaining he had been having an affair. He asked his wife for a divorce so that he could marry his new girlfriend. Continuing to work in Shanghai, her father was interned during World War II from 1943 to 1945 by the invading Japanese. After the war, he returned to England with his second wife, Beatrice.

Hookham began her studies with Serafina Astafieva, but was spotted by Dame Ninette de Valois and invited to join the Vic-Wells Ballet School, which would later become the Royal Ballet. She trained under Olga Preobrajenska and Volkova. Her first solo performance occurred in 1933, as an actress rather than a dancer, using the interim name &quot;Margot Fontes&quot;, as a child in the production of &quot;The Haunted Ballroom&quot; by de Valois. In 1934, she danced as a snowflake in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, still using the name Fontes. Although Hookham&#x27;s mother had written to her Fontes relatives, requesting their permission for her daughter to use the name for her stage career, the final response was no, possibly due to the family&#x27;s wish to avoid an association with a theatrical performer. Hilda and her daughter subsequently looked up variations of Fontes in the telephone directory, choosing the more British-sounding Fontene and adding a twist to make it Fonteyn. The following year, she took the name by which she was known for the remainder of her professional life, &quot;Margot Fonteyn&quot;, modifying her maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname, &quot;Fontes&quot; — in Portuguese, &quot;fonte&quot; means &quot;fountain&quot;. In Middle and modern English until the 16th century, it was spelled &quot;fonteyn&quot;. Her brother, Felix, who became a specialist of dance photography, eventually adopted the same surname.

==Career==
===Vic-Wells years (1935–1945)===
In 1935, Fonteyn had her solo debut, playing Young Tregennis in &quot;The Haunted Ballroom.&quot; That same year, Sir Frederick Ashton created the role of the bride in his choreography of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le baiser de la fée&quot; specifically for her. Though he appreciated her lyric qualities and found her elegant, Ashton said of her early years that Fonteyn had brittle stubbornness and lacked polish. In spite of her perceived shortcomings, he cast her as the lead, playing the Creole girl in his production, &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. When Alicia Markova, the first &quot;Prima Ballerina&quot; of the company, left the Vic-Wells later in 1935, Fonteyn shared the lead with other members of the company, but quickly rose to the top of the field of dancers. That year, she spent her summer holidays in Paris, where she studied with the exiled Russian ballerinas Olga Preobrajenska, Mathilde Kschessinska, and Lubov Egorova. She returned for further studies with them the following summers. 
Using Fonteyn&#x27;s delicate and somewhat feline grace to advantage, &quot;Sir Frederick often cast her as a frail or otherworldly being&quot;. In 1936, she was cast as the unattainable muse in his &quot;Apparitions&quot;, a role which consolidated her partnership with Robert Helpmann, and the same year played a wistful, poverty-stricken flower seller in &quot;Nocturne&quot;. Her success in &quot;Nocturne&quot; marked a turning point in Ashton&#x27;s perception of Fonteyn and he recognized that she could become the heir to Markova as lead dancer for the company. Shortly afterwards, the company began experimenting with televised performances, accepting paid engagements to perform for the BBC at Broadcasting House and Alexandra Palace. Fonteyn danced her first televised solo in December 1936, performing the Polka from &quot;Façade&quot;. Although the dancers enjoyed these engagements, the tiny television screens with their unsteady blue pictures meant that the medium was not yet sophisticated enough to become a lucrative avenue for the company.

The following year, Fonteyn was given the comic role of Julia in &quot;A Wedding Bouquet&quot; and was cast with Robert Helpmann performing the &quot;pas de deux&quot;, imitating Victorian ice skaters, in Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Les Patineurs&quot;. Helpmann was her most constant partner in the 1930s and 1940s, helping her develop her theatricality. Decades later Fonteyn would name Helpmann as her favourite partner across the span of her career. Constant Lambert, as the company music director, assisted with her musicality. Beginning in 1935, Fonteyn and Lambert developed a romantic relationship, which would continue on and off for the duration of his life. She had previously been involved with Donald Hodson, the Controller of the BBC Overseas Service. Lambert dedicated his score for the ballet &quot;Horoscope&quot; (1938) to Fonteyn.

When the company visited the University of Cambridge for a brief professional engagement in 1937, Fonteyn first met Roberto &quot;Tito&quot; Arias, an 18-year-old law student from Panama who would later become her husband. Fonteyn became enamored with Arias after seeing him perform a rumba dance at a party. The pair enjoyed their time together for the next week, but Arias then returned to Panama for the summer holidays. His lack of subsequent communication left Fonteyn despondent.

By 1939 Fonteyn had performed the principal roles in &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and was appointed as the Prima Ballerina of the Vic-Wells, soon to be renamed the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet. Her performance in &quot;Swan Lake&quot; had been a turning point in her career, convincing critics and audiences that a British ballerina could successfully dance the lead role in a full-length classical Russian ballet. The reviewer Arnold Haskell wrote that never before had Fonteyn&#x27;s performance been &quot;so regal in manner or half so brilliant&quot;, while the writer Tangye Lean commented that she &quot;rose to it with a stability that one had not seen in her before&quot;.

Throughout World War II, the company danced nightly, sometimes also performing matinées, to entertain troops. With such a heavy schedule, the dancers were frequently obliged to complete three to four times their usual weekly number of appearances. Fonteyn later recalled dancing so often that she sometimes &quot;stood trembling in the wings, unable to remember if I had finished my solo before I left the stage&quot;. Wartime drafts meant that the company lost many of its male dancers to the armed forces. Shows had to be carefully chosen or edited to help ensure that an almost entirely female cast could perform all the roles. Fonteyn was often paired with young, inexperienced male dancers pulled straight from ballet schools. With short London seasons, they also travelled abroad and were in the Netherlands when it was invaded in May 1940, escaping back to England with nothing more than the costumes they were wearing. In September 1940, as the London Blitz began, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre was turned into an air raid shelter. The company of dancers was temporarily displaced, touring professionally across England.

In August 1943, Fonteyn took an unexplained sick leave from the company for two months, missing their opening season performances. It was believed by many of her close friends – and her biographer, Meredith Daneman, that she underwent an abortion. Her relationship with Lambert had grown difficult, as he was drinking heavily and having affairs with other women. Concerned about her daughter&#x27;s welfare, Fonteyn&#x27;s mother took matters into her own hands, gently encouraging her daughter to move on from Lambert by setting her up with film director Charles Hasse. Fonteyn and Hasse became lovers, and their close relationship lasted for the next four years.

During the war, Ashton created roles such as his bleak wartime piece &quot;Dante Sonata&quot; (1940) and the glittery &quot;The Wanderer&quot; (1941) for Fonteyn. She also performed notably in &quot;Coppélia&quot;, imbuing the role with humour. The war years helped her develop stamina and improve her natural talent. In February 1944, she danced the role of the Young Girl in &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot; and was coached by Russian prima ballerina Tamara Karsavina.

===Covent Garden years (1946–1955)===

In 1946, the company moved to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. One of Fonteyn&#x27;s first roles was at a command performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; as Aurora with King George, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary, both princesses – Elizabeth and Margaret – and Prime Minister Clement Attlee in attendance. Initially faced with a costume department severely impacted by post-war rationing, the company had put out a call for every available scrap of silk, velvet or brocade, cutting up and re-purposing old opera costumes, furs and even velvet curtains to create a lavish production. In contrast to most Russian dancers, who traditionally learned roles from previous generations of dancers, Fonteyn had no such living references readily available to teach her the role of Aurora and was obliged to create her own interpretation. The ballet became a signature production for the company and a distinguishing role for Fonteyn, marking her &quot;arrival&quot; as the &quot;brightest crown&quot; of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Company.

Ashton immediately created &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; to capitalize on the success of the opening. Of the six dancers in the production, Fonteyn&#x27;s performance was dubbed &quot;brilliant&quot; and Moira Shearer was singled out for her elegance. When the American Ballet Theatre visited the Royal Opera House in 1946, Fonteyn became a close friend of the New York dancer Nora Kaye. Fonteyn appeared on television in 1946, to mark the re-opening of Alexandra Palace after the War. Her television appearances were followed by a performance with the choreographer Léonide Massine as the miller&#x27;s wife in his &quot;The Three-Cornered Hat&quot; and as the lead in the abstract debut of &quot;Scènes de ballet&quot; which Ashton wrote for her.

In 1948, Fonteyn went to Paris to perform as Agathe, a role created for her, in &quot;Les Demoiselles de la nuit&quot; by the choreographer Roland Petit. The admiration of Petit gave her new confidence and assurance, which showed in her performance in Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, though she was injured on the first night, tearing a ligament in her ankle. She was unable to dance for several months, missing the premiere of Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. She recovered sufficiently to dance with Michael Somes in the Christmas presentation of the ballet, and made her mark in the role of Cinderella by challenging the traditional costume for Act I, replacing the usual brown outfit with a stark black dress and a kerchief tied severely over her hair. Observers commented that Fonteyn inserted a new, stronger sense of pathos into the performance.

Reprising the role of Aurora in 1949 when the Royal Ballet toured the United States, Fonteyn instantly became a celebrity, gaining international recognition. In New York, the American showman Sol Hurok said that the Metropolitan Opera House premiere of Fonteyn&#x27;s Aurora was the &quot;most outstanding&quot; performance he had ever facilitated, the curtain calls lasting half an hour. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called Fonteyn &quot;unmistakably such a star&quot;: &quot;London has known this for some time, Europe has found it out and last night she definitely conquered another continent.&quot; Fonteyn was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.
Upon returning to England, Fonteyn danced in George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Ballet Imperial&quot;, before travelling to Italy with Helpmann and Pamela May as a guest star in &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. In 1949, she profiled choreographies of Sir Frederick Ashton, which were no longer in the repertoire of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Company, dancing on television with Michael Somes and Harold Turner. Fonteyn appeared in America on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; for the first time in 1951, and would return several times. Her performances were credited with improving the popularity of dance with American audiences. These were followed by two of her most noted roles, as the lead in Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; (1951) and &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1952).

Fonteyn was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1951 for her contributions to British ballet. Plagued by injury, she considered retiring, especially after her most frequent partner of the 1950s, Somes, began to take less challenging roles. On an American tour in 1953, Fonteyn found herself suddenly reacquainted with Roberto &quot;Tito&quot; Arias – whom she had spent time with at Cambridge University in 1937 – when he surprised her with a visit to her dressing room after a performance of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Arias was now a politician and Panamanian delegate to the United Nations. Although he already had a wife and children, Arias initiated a courtship with Fonteyn and began seeking a divorce from his wife. She returned from the American tour and in the 1954 season debuted in &quot;Entrada de Madame Butterfly&quot;, later called &quot;Entrée japonaise&quot;, in Granada, Spain, followed by her first performance in the title role of &quot;The Firebird&quot;. She was taught the part by Tamara Karsavina, who had debuted the role in 1910. Fonteyn&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot; was &quot;among her greatest achievements&quot; for her ability to use her jetés to simulate flight.

===Marriage and politics (1955–1959)===
In Paris on 6 February 1955, Fonteyn married Arias, adopting the formal married name of &quot;Margot Fonteyn de Arias&quot;, in the Spanish-language tradition. In 1955, she returned to the stage and found success in St. Petersburg, dancing the role of Medora in &quot;Le Corsaire&quot;, opposite Rudolf Nureyev. On 12 December 1955, Fonteyn appeared with Michael Somes in a live U.S. television colour production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, for the anthology series &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;, on NBC. The production was underwritten by the Ford Company and ran for an hour and a half, attracting around 30 million viewers.

In 1956, she and Somes were guest artists featured in Act II of Swan Lake, at the wedding of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III of Monaco. The following year, the duo appeared in a &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Fonteyn starred with Somes in a 1958 BBC Television adaptation of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; which premiered on 21 December. She was successful in two other Ashton ballets, &quot;La Péri&quot; (1956) and &quot;Ondine&quot; (1958), before becoming a freelance dancer in 1959, allowing her to accept the many international engagements she was offered.
Shortly before her marriage, Fonteyn had been selected to succeed Adeline Genée, as president of the Royal Academy of Dance and though she protested the appointment, the academy overruled her decision. Adding planning meetings for a new dance syllabus and attending meetings of the academy, she was honoured as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1956 New Years Honours List. As her husband had been appointed an ambassador to the court of St James upon her marriage, Fonteyn also attended to the duties required of a diplomat&#x27;s wife. She was nevertheless criticized for her obvious lack of interest in politics.

In 1956, she gave four performances in Johannesburg, South Africa, at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and another at Zoo Lake with Michael Somes. Though they received top reviews, she was criticized for performing, despite the dancers&#x27; union ban because of apartheid. She was also criticized for performing for Imelda Marcos and was once detained for attending a party at which drugs were used.
She also danced in Chile during Military dictatorship and she became close to Hope Somoza, the wife of Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

====Coup d&#x27;état plot in Panama====
In April 1959, Fonteyn was arrested, detained for 24 hours in a Panamanian jail, and then deported to New York City, after her husband had staged a coup d&#x27;état against Panamanin President Ernesto de la Guardia, possibly with the support of Fidel Castro. According to Fonteyn, the plot was hatched when she and her husband were visiting Cuba in January 1959, with Castro promising to assist Arias with arms or men. The couple went fishing on their boat &quot;The Nola&quot; and during the voyage ordered fishermen to raise a buoy loaded with arms. The fishermen reported the couple, who hurriedly decided that Arias should try to escape detection. In the night Arias jumped ship, boarding the shrimp boat &quot;Elaine&quot;, while Fonteyn used her own yacht as a decoy to divert the government forces. She returned to Panama City to turn herself in, hoping her surrender would help her husband.

Meeting at the prison with the British ambassador to Panama Sir Ian Henderson, Fonteyn confessed her involvement and the British Foreign Office granted that her statement was confidential. The British embassy arranged for her release, and flew her to New York City on 22 April, without disclosing to the United States government that Cuba had been involved in the plot. Arias took refuge in the Brazilian embassy of Panama and arrived safely in Lima, Peru, the same day Fonteyn arrived in New York. The couple were reunited in June in Rio de Janeiro and by November she had returned to the stage, dancing with Michael Somes in an Ashton &quot;pas de deux&quot; for a London benefit performance. Fonteyn danced in the BBC Eurovision production of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in the title role with Jelko Yuresha on 20 December 1959.

===Nureyev years (1961–1979)===

Fonteyn began her greatest artistic partnership at a time when many people, including the head of the Royal Ballet, Ninette de Valois, thought she was about to retire. In 1961 Rudolf Nureyev, star of the Kirov Ballet, defected in Paris and was invited by de Valois to join the Royal Ballet. De Valois offered Fonteyn the opportunity to dance with Nureyev in his debut, and though reluctant because of their 19-year age difference, Fonteyn agreed.

On 21 February 1962, Nureyev and Fonteyn performed together in &quot;Giselle&quot; to an enthusiastic capacity crowd, for which they received 15 minutes of applause and 20 curtain calls. The performance was followed by a show-stopping performance of &quot;Le Corsaire Pas de Deux&quot; on 3 November.

The press described their performance as &quot;otherworldly&quot;; &quot;The Observer&quot; called it a &quot;knockout&quot; and the pairing &quot;history-making&quot;. A few days later, they performed &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; to rave reviews, which were carried in United States newspapers. Fonteyn was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Cambridge in 1962.

Sir Frederick Ashton choreographed &quot;Marguerite and Armand&quot; for them, which no other couple danced until the 21st century. The 1963 premiere was well publicised before its opening and teamed them with Michael Somes, who played the disapproving father. Composed as a series of &quot;pas de deux&quot;, interrupted by only one solo, the ballet built intensity from the initial &quot;coup de foudre&quot; to the death scene. According to Somes, the pairing of Nureyev and Fonteyn was brilliant, as they were not partners but two stars of equal talent who pushed each other to their best performances. Attended by the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Princess Marina, the production was an immediate success. It became a signature work for the duo, sealing their partnership.

In 1964, Fonteyn and Nureyev toured from Sydney to Melbourne, performing in &quot;Giselle&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot; with The Australian Ballet. After a brief break, they resumed their performances in Stuttgart. On 8 June that year, while the duo were performing in Bath, they were advised that a rival Panamanian politician had shot Fonteyn&#x27;s husband Arias, but it was unclear if he was in imminent danger. Fonteyn, though shaken, danced in MacMillan&#x27;s new &quot;pas de deux&quot;, &quot;Divertimento&quot;, on 9 June, before flying home to Panama.

She found that Arias had been shot four times by Alfredo Jimenez, leaving him a quadriplegic for the rest of his life. Thoughts of retirement receded, as she needed to continue working to pay Arias&#x27; medical bills. Though he used a wheelchair, Fonteyn took him with her on most of her travels. Within two weeks, she had returned to London, having arranged for Arias to be treated at the National Spinal Injuries Centre of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and resumed dancing. Over the next ten days, Fonteyn danced in six performances of &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, and &quot;Marguerite and Armand&quot; while rehearsing Nureyev&#x27;s production of &quot;Raymonda&quot;. A coma and relapse in Arias&#x27; condition forced her to miss all but the final performance of &quot;Raymonda&quot; in Spoleto.
Fonteyn and Nureyev were especially noted for their performance of classics, such as &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, which Fonteyn stripped to the essence of the roles and constantly improved her performance. Nureyev insisted that Fonteyn partner with him in &quot;La Bayadère&quot; and &quot;Raymonda&quot;, and wrote his own version of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for them to perform with the Vienna State Opera Ballet in 1964. The performance was filmed and Lord Snowdon took pictures for the 27 November 1964 issue of &quot;Life&quot;. On 20 January 1965, Fonteyn and Nureyev performed the &quot;Le Corsaire Pas de Deux&quot; at the inaugural ceremonies for President Lyndon B. Johnson in Washington, D. C.

Later that year, the couple debuted the title roles in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; choreographed by Sir Kenneth MacMillan. MacMillan had intended the roles to be performed by Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, but David Webster, the manager of the Royal Opera House, insisted on Fonteyn and Nureyev. A year after the debut, the production was still drawing queues for its nightly performances. The audiences littered the duo with flowers, demanding repeated curtain-calls. Fonteyn&#x27;s depth as an actor made the performance unique, making Juliet one of her most acclaimed roles.

Despite differences in background and temperament – she was methodical while he was wildly exuberant – and a 19-year gap in their ages, Fonteyn and Nureyev became lifelong friends and famously loyal to each other. Fonteyn would not approve an unflattering photograph of Nureyev, nor would she dance with other partners in ballets within his repertoire. The extent of their physical relationship remains unclear. Nureyev said that they had one, while Fonteyn denied it. Her biographer, Meredith Daneman, said that in spite of no real evidence, her opinion was that they did, yet Nureyev&#x27;s biographer, Diane Solway concluded that they did not. Nureyev said about her:
&quot;At the end of &#x27;Lac des Cygnes&#x27;, when she left the stage in her great white tutu I would have followed her to the end of the world.&quot;
In 1965, Fonteyn and Nureyev appeared together in the recorded versions &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, and the &quot;Le Corsaire Pas de Deux&quot;, as part of the documentary &quot;An Evening with the Royal Ballet&quot;. The film grossed over US$1 million, creating a record for a dance film at the time, and was shown in over 50 theatres in New York and New Jersey alone over the week of 6 December 1965. Under the guidance of director Paul Czinner, who used a multi-camera technique to give the feel of a stage performance, they also filmed their famous version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1966. That same year, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the Duke of Devonshire upon his installation as the Chancellor of the University of Manchester.

In 1967 Roland Petit wrote a new ballet for the duo, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. It was an abstract, modern production designed to emphasize Rudolf as a virile Adam and Fonteyn as a chic Eve. With pop art décor and flashing neon, the ballet titillated the fans, including Mick Jagger and his girlfriend, the singer Marianne Faithfull.

Fonteyn went into semi-retirement in 1972, relinquishing parts in full ballets and limiting herself to only a variety of one-act performances. In 1974, she was awarded the Royal Society of Arts&#x27; Benjamin Franklin Medal, in recognition of her having built bridges between Britain and the U.S. through her art. She ventured into modern dance, performing as &quot;Desdemona&quot; in José Limón&#x27; &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Pavane&quot; June 1975 with the Chicago Ballet followed by a performance of the same dance with Nureyev at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in July. Between the two performances, Fonteyn was appearing with the Martha Graham Dance Company in Saratoga, New York City, Athens and London. After the performance at The Kennedy Center, her tour went on to Brazil.

In November 1975, she and Nureyev appeared in &quot;Fonteyn &amp; Nureyev on Broadway&quot; at the Uris Theatre. The appearance, though memorable, confirmed that Fonteyn was no longer able to execute more demanding roles. In 1976, she published her autobiography, though it was not a tell-all. Her husband was still living and Fonteyn was a very private person, as well as proper and fastidious. In 1977, she was awarded the Shakespeare Prize, in Hamburg by the Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S., as the first dancer ever honoured with the award.

===Cattle rancher (1979–1990)===
Fonteyn retired in 1979 at the age of 60, 45 years after becoming the Royal Ballet&#x27;s &quot;prima ballerina&quot;. Fonteyn and Nureyev had created a partnership on and off stage that lasted until her retirement, after which they remained lifelong friends. For her 60th birthday, Fonteyn was feted by the Royal Ballet, dancing a duet with Ashton in his &quot;Salut d&#x27;amour&quot; and a tango from Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Façade&quot; with her former partner Helpmann. At the end of the evening, she was officially pronounced &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; of the Royal Ballet. She performed with Nureyev in his summer season, taking the part of lead nymph in &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; by Vaslav Nijinsky and as the girl in &quot;Le Spectre de la rose&quot;. Fonteyn and Nureyev remained close even after she retired to a Panama cattle farm with her husband. The small farmhouse near El Higo, which did not have a telephone, was in a remote village, but she stayed in touch and the two occasionally performed together. Making telephone calls from a neighbour&#x27;s hotel, Fonteyn spoke with Nureyev several times each week. She discovered that she had a real interest in raising cattle and developed a herd of four hundred head.

In 1979, Fonteyn wrote &quot;The Magic of Dance&quot; which was aired on the BBC as a television series in which she starred and was published in book form. The six-part BBC2 series, explored aspects in the development of dance from the 17th to the 20th century across the world, including scenes shot on location in Australia, China, France, Monte Carlo, Russia, and the United States. It included coverage of a wide range of dancers besides herself and Nureyev, including Fred Astaire, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Sammy Davis Jr., Isadora Duncan, Fanny Elssler, Kyra Nijinsky and Marie Taglioni. The series caused a stir because up to that time she had not been known for speaking on camera, and after rehearsing what she would say on each segment, she ad libbed the lines without cue cards. Though some critics failed to grasp that the production was neither a history of dance nor Fonteyn&#x27;s biography, the series was &quot;brilliantly successful&quot; and Fonteyn received praise from American, Australian, and British critics.

That same year, Fonteyn also published &quot;A Dancer&#x27;s World: An Introduction for Parents and Students&quot;. She danced the role of &quot;Lady Capulet&quot; in Nureyev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with Rudolf and Carla Fracci performing the leading roles in 1981 at the Met in New York City. In 1982, she was made chancellor of Durham University, which she accepted as a great honour, considering her limited and frequently interrupted education. She travelled to Durham annually to attend the degree ceremony of the graduates and wholeheartedly participated in the duties required until her death. In 1983, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of fine arts from Santa Clara University, in the California city of the same name. Fonteyn also published &quot;Pavlova: Portrait of a Dancer&quot;, in 1984, as a homage to Anna Pavlova, whom she admired. In February 1986 (aged 66) she appeared on stage in Miami, in a two-night engagement, as the Queen in &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Fonteyn&#x27;s last performance with Nureyev occurred at the &quot;Maratona-Festa a Corte&quot;, in Mantua, Italy, on 16 September 1988 in &quot;Baroque Pas de Trois&quot;, along with ballerina Carla Fracci.

In 1989, shortly before the death of her husband, Fonteyn was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Having used up all her savings to care for Arias in his long infirmity, and now retired without a pension, she dreaded the ordeal. Her step-daughter, Querube Arias, cared for her and accompanied her to Houston, Texas, on her regular trips to M.D. Anderson Hospital. Nureyev was one of the few people she told of her problems and he arranged to visit her regularly in Houston, despite his busy schedule as a performer and choreographer. By 1990, she had undergone three operations and was bedridden. Out of money, Fonteyn began to sell her jewelry to pay for her care, and Nureyev anonymously helped to pay the bills. In February 1990 the Public Broadcasting Service aired &quot;The Margot Fonteyn Story&quot; as part of its series Great Performances. In the documentary, Nureyev said that they danced with &quot;one body, one soul&quot;. Fonteyn&#x27;s biographer, Daneman, said their uncanny bond of empathy went beyond the understanding most people have for each other: &quot;Most people are on level A. They were on level Z&quot;. In May, a gala was held at Covent Gardens to raise money for her care. Placido Domingo volunteered to sing and both Somes and Nureyev danced. The event was attended by more than 2,000 guests, including Princess Margaret, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dame Ninette de Valois, raising £250,000 for a trust fund to provide for Fonteyn&#x27;s support.

==Death and legacy==

Shortly before her death, Fonteyn converted to Roman Catholicism so that she could have her ashes buried in the same tomb as Arias. As her health worsened, she received a regular flood of messages and flowers from well-wishers, including Queen Elizabeth II and the President of Panama. Fonteyn died on 21 February 1991 in a hospital in Panama City, aged 71, on the 29th anniversary of her premiere with Nureyev in &quot;Giselle&quot;. She was buried with Arias near their home in Panama and a memorial service was held in London on 2 July 1991 at Westminster Abbey. A grief-stricken Nureyev, who was dealing with his own health issues in the form of AIDS, was unable to attend either service.
In her hometown of Reigate, a statue created by British sculptor Nathan David in 1980, stands in tribute to Fonteyn. Depicting her in her favourite role of &quot;Ondine&quot;, the statue was commissioned by fans worldwide. The main hall in Dunelm House, the Student Union building at the University of Durham, is named the &quot;Fonteyn Ballroom&quot; in her honour, as is the foyer to the Great Hall of University College, Durham, in Durham Castle. In 2005, &quot;Margot&#x27;s Closet&quot;, a dancing apparel and accessory shop, named in homage to Fonteyn, opened in Marietta, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb. The &quot;Margot Fonteyn Academy of Ballet&quot; established in Peekskill, New York, in 2007 is named in her honour.

In the early 1990s, the fossil plant &quot;Williamsonia margotiana&quot; was named after Fonteyn. She was one of five &quot;Women of Achievement&quot; selected for a set of British stamps issued in August 1996. In the 1998 film &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; about British cellist Jacqueline du Pre, Fonteyn is portrayed in a cameo appearance by Nyree Dawn Porter. In 2005 Tony Palmer made a documentary for ITV about Fonteyn, titled simply &quot;Margot&quot;. It includes interviews with several colleagues from the dance world, Nureyev&#x27;s personal assistant, and Fonteyn&#x27;s sister-in-law, Phoebe Fonteyn. The BBC made a film about Fonteyn, broadcast on 30 November 2009, based on Daneman&#x27;s biography and starring Anne-Marie Duff as the ballerina. In 2016, the English Heritage Trust installed a blue plaque on the building where Fonteyn lived when she was performing with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet. To mark the 100th anniversary of her birth, The Theatre and Film Guild installed a commemorative blue plaque to Fonteyn at her childhood home at 3 Elm Grove Road, Ealing. Jersey Post also released a set of six commemorative stamps and a miniature sheet honouring Fonteyn in 2019.

<text>Text mode is a computer display mode in which content is internally represented on a computer screen in terms of characters rather than individual pixels. Typically, the screen consists of a uniform rectangular grid of &quot;character cells&quot;, each of which contains one of the characters of a character set; at the same time, contrasted to graphics mode or other kinds of computer graphics modes.

Text mode applications communicate with the user by using command-line interfaces and text user interfaces. Many character sets used in text mode applications also contain a limited set of predefined semi-graphical characters usable for drawing boxes and other rudimentary graphics, which can be used to highlight the content or to simulate widget or control interface objects found in GUI programs. A typical example is the IBM code page 437 character set.

An important characteristic of text mode programs is that they assume monospaced fonts, where every character has the same width on screen, which allows them to easily maintain the vertical alignment when displaying semi-graphical characters. This was an analogy of early mechanical printers which had fixed pitch. This way, the output seen on the screen could be sent directly to the printer maintaining the same format.

Depending on the environment, the screen buffer can be directly addressable. Programs that display output on remote video terminals must issue special control sequences to manipulate the screen buffer. The most popular standards for such control sequences are ANSI and VT100.

Programs accessing the screen buffer through control sequences may lose synchronization with the actual display so that many text mode programs have a &quot;redisplay everything&quot; command, often associated with the key combination.

== History ==
Text mode video rendering came to prominence in the early 1970s, when video-oriented text terminals started to replace teleprinters in the interactive use of computers.

== Benefits ==
The advantages of text modes as compared to graphics modes include lower memory consumption and faster screen manipulation. At the time text terminals were beginning to replace teleprinters in the 1970s, the extremely high cost of random-access memory in that period made it exorbitantly expensive to install enough memory for a computer to simultaneously store the current value of &quot;every&quot; pixel on a screen, to form what would now be called a framebuffer. Early framebuffers were standalone devices which cost tens of thousands of dollars, in addition to the expense of the advanced high-resolution displays to which they were connected. For applications that required simple line graphics but for which the expense of a framebuffer could not be justified, vector displays were a popular workaround. But there were many computer applications (e.g., data entry into a database) for which all that was required was the ability to render ordinary text in a quick and cost-effective fashion to a cathode-ray tube.

Text mode avoids the problem of expensive memory by having dedicated display hardware re-render each line of text from characters into pixels with &quot;each&quot; scan of the screen by the cathode ray. In turn, the display hardware needs only enough memory to store the pixels equivalent to one line of text (or even less) at a time. Thus, the computer&#x27;s screen buffer only stores and knows about the underlying text characters (hence the name &quot;text mode&quot;) and the only location where the actual pixels representing those characters exist as a single unified image is the screen itself, as viewed by the user (thanks to the phenomenon of persistence of vision).

For example, a screen buffer sufficient to hold a standard grid of 80 by 25 characters requires at least 2,000 bytes. Assuming a monochrome display, 8 bits per byte, and a standard size of 8 times 8 bits for each character, a framebuffer large enough to hold every pixel on the resulting screen would require at least 128,000 bits, 16,000 bytes, or just under 16 kilobytes. By the standards of modern computers, these may seem like trivial amounts of memory, but to put them in context, the original Apple II was released in 1977 with only four kilobytes of memory and a price of $1,300 in U.S. dollars (at a time when the minimum wage in the United States was only $2.30 per hour). Furthermore, from a business perspective, the business case for text terminals made no sense unless they could be produced and operated more cheaply than the paper-hungry teleprinters they were supposed to replace.

Another advantage of text mode is that it has relatively low bandwidth requirements in remote terminal use. Thus, a text mode remote terminal can necessarily update the screen much faster than a graphics mode remote terminal linked to the same amount of bandwidth (and in turn will seem more responsive), since the remote server may only need to transmit a few dozen bytes for each screen update in text mode, as opposed to complex raster graphics remote procedure calls that may require the transmission and rendering of entire bitmaps.

== User-defined characters ==

The border between text mode and graphical programs can sometimes be fuzzy, especially on the PC&#x27;s VGA hardware, because many later text mode programs tried to push the model to the extreme by playing with the video controller. For example, they redefined the character set in order to create custom semi-graphical characters, or even created the appearance of a graphical mouse pointer by redefining the appearance of the characters over which the mouse pointer was shown at a given time.

Text mode rendering with user-defined characters has also been useful for 2D computer and video games because the game screen can be manipulated much faster than with pixel-oriented rendering.

==Technical basis==

A video controller implementing a text mode usually uses two distinct areas of memory. &quot;Character memory&quot; or a &quot;pattern table&quot; contains a raster font in use, where each character is represented by a dot matrix (a matrix of bits), so the character memory could be considered as a three-dimensional bit array. &quot;Display matrix&quot; (a &quot;text buffer&quot;, &quot;screen buffer&quot;, or &quot;nametable&quot;) tracks which character is in each cell. In the simple case the display matrix can be just a matrix of code points (so named &quot;character pointer table&quot;), but it usually stores for each character position not only a code, but also &quot;attributes&quot;.
In the case of raster scan output, which is the most common for computer monitors, the corresponding video signal is made by the &quot;character generator&quot;, a special electronic unit similar to devices with the same name used in video technology. The video controller has two registers: scan line counter and dot counter, serving as coordinates in the screen dot matrix. Each of them must be divided by corresponding glyph size to obtain an index in the display matrix; the remainder is an index in glyph matrix. If glyph size equals to 2n, then it is possible just to use n low bits of a binary register as an index in glyph matrix, and the rest of bits as an index in the display matrix — see the scheme.

The character memory resides in a read-only memory in some systems. Other systems allow the use of RAM for this purpose, making it possible to redefine the typeface and even the character set for application-specific purposes. The use of RAM-based characters also facilitates some special techniques, such as the implementation of a pixel-graphics frame buffer by reserving some characters for a bitmap and writing pixels directly to their corresponding character memory. In some historical graphics chips, including the TMS9918, the MOS Technology VIC, and the Game Boy graphics hardware, this was actually the canonical way of doing pixel graphics.

Text modes often assign &quot;attributes&quot; to the displayed characters. For example, the VT100 terminal allows each character to be underlined, brightened, blinking or inverse. Color-supporting devices usually allow the color of each character, and often the background color as well, to be selected from a limited palette of colors. These attributes can either coexist with the character indices or use a different memory area called &quot;color memory&quot; or &quot;attribute memory&quot;.

Some text mode implementations also have the concept of line attributes. For example, the VT100-compatible line of text terminals supports the doubling of the width and height of the characters on individual text lines.

==PC common text modes==

Depending on the graphics adapter used, a variety of text modes are available on IBM PC–compatible computers. They are listed on the table below:

MDA text could be emphasized with bright, underline, reverse and blinking attributes.

Video cards in general are backward compatible, i.e. EGA supports all MDA and CGA modes, VGA supports MDA, CGA and EGA modes.

By far the most common text mode used in DOS environments, and initial Windows consoles, is the default 80 columns by 25 rows, or 80×25, with 16 colors. This mode was available on practically all IBM and compatible personal computers. Several programs, such as terminal emulators, used only 80×24 for the main display and reserved the bottom row for a status bar.

Two other VGA text modes, 80×43 and 80×50, exist but were very rarely used. The 40-column text modes were never very popular outside games and other applications designed for compatibility with television monitors, and were used only for demonstration purposes or with very old hardware.

Character sizes and graphical resolutions for the extended VESA-compatible Super VGA text modes are manufacturer-dependent. Also on these display adapters, available colors can be halved from 16 to 8 when a second customized character set is employed (giving a total repertoire of 512 —instead the common 256— different graphic characters simultaneously displayed on the screen).

Some cards (e.g. S3) supported custom very large text modes, like 100×37 or even 160×120. In Linux systems, a program called SVGATextMode is often used with SVGA cards to set up very large console text modes, such as for use with split-screen terminal multiplexers.

== Modern usage ==
Many modern programs with a graphical interface simulate the display style of text mode programs, notably when it is important to preserve the vertical alignment of text, e.g., during computer programming. There exist also software components to emulate text mode, such as terminal emulators or command line consoles. In Microsoft Windows, the Win32 console usually opens in emulated, graphical window mode. It can be switched to full screen, true text mode and vice versa by pressing the Alt and Enter keys together. This is no longer supported by the WDDM display drivers introduced with Windows Vista.

Linux virtual consoles operate in text mode. Most Linux distributions support several virtual console screens, accessed by pressing Ctrl, Alt and a function key together.

The AAlib open source library provides programs and routines that specialize in translating standard image and video files, such as PNG and WMV, and displaying them as a collection of ASCII characters. This enables a rudimentary viewing of graphics files on text mode systems, and on text mode web browsers such as Lynx.

<text>The Anaheim Piranhas were a professional arena football team that played in the Arena Football League from 1994 to 1997. They played their home games at Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, California. The team was originally known as the Las Vegas Sting, prior to moving to Anaheim in 1996. The team was owned by future Arena Football League commissioner C. David Baker.

==History==
===Las Vegas Sting (1994–1995)===
The Las Vegas Sting was a team which competed in the Arena Football League during the 1994 and 1995 seasons. Their home games in 1994 were played in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and they were moved to the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for the 1995 season. The team was relocated to Anaheim, California prior to the start of the 1996 season, at which time it was renamed the Anaheim Piranhas.

===Anaheim Piranhas (1996–1997)===
The Piranhas played their home games at Arrowhead Pond, also the home of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim of the National Hockey League. The team was not an overwhelmingly successful draw in the high-overhead Southern California market and folded after the conclusion of the 1997 season. The arena (now known as the Honda Center) would once again be the home of an AFL franchise with the launching of the Los Angeles Kiss in 2014.

<text>The Charlotte Rage were a professional arena football team based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. They were members of the Arena Football League from 1992 to 1996. They played their home games at the Charlotte Coliseum from 1992 to 1994 and then again in 1996 and the Independence Arena (now the Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum) in 1995. They were owned by Allen J. Schwalb, Joanne Faruggia and former National Football League and United States Football League quarterback Cliff Stoudt.

==History==
The Rage were founded as an expansion team on October 10, 1991, by motion picture financier Allen J. Schwalb, who backed some of the biggest blockbusters of the 1980s including &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. They competed in the 1992–1996 seasons. They played their home games at the Charlotte Coliseum, then also home of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association from 1992 to 1994 and again in 1996. They played the 1995 season at the much smaller Independence Arena.

The team made the playoffs in 1993 and 1994, losing both times to the Arizona Rattlers in the first round. They are best known for signing former Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Joe DeLamielleure, who played only a handful of games in 1992 before retiring from football for good. He was the only member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to have played in the AFL, a distinction that ended in 2017 when Kurt Warner, a three-year veteran of the AFL, was inducted.

Their logo consisted of an enraged bull which was both snorting fire and surrounded by it.

The team was discontinued after the completion of the 1996 season.

The AFL would return to the Coliseum for the 2003 Arena Football League season when the Carolina Cobras moved from Raleigh, North Carolina.

<doc id="620616" wikidata="Q94291140" url="?curid=620616" title="Catechol-O-methyltransferase">
<text>Catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase (COMT; ) is one of several enzymes that degrade catecholamines (neurotransmitters such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine), catecholestrogens, and various drugs and substances having a catechol structure. In humans, catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase protein is encoded by the COMT gene. Two isoforms of COMT are produced: the soluble short form (S-COMT) and the membrane bound long form (MB-COMT). As the regulation of catecholamines is impaired in a number of medical conditions, several pharmaceutical drugs target COMT to alter its activity and therefore the availability of catecholamines. COMT was first discovered by the biochemist Julius Axelrod in 1957.

== Function ==
Catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase is involved in the inactivation of the catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). The enzyme introduces a methyl group to the catecholamine, which is donated by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Any compound having a catechol structure, like catecholestrogens and catechol-containing flavonoids, are substrates of COMT.

Levodopa, a precursor of catecholamines, is an important substrate of COMT. COMT inhibitors, like entacapone, save levodopa from COMT and prolong the action of levodopa. Entacapone is a widely used adjunct drug of levodopa therapy. When given with an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase (carbidopa or benserazide), levodopa is optimally saved. This &quot;triple therapy&quot; is becoming a standard in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Specific reactions catalyzed by COMT include:
* -DOPA (levodopa) → 3-&quot;O&quot;-methyldopa
* Dopamine → 3-methoxytyramine
* DOPAC → HVA (homovanillic acid)
* Norepinephrine → normetanephrine
* Epinephrine → metanephrine
* Dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol (DOPEG) → methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MOPEG)
* 3,4-Dihydroxymandelic acid (DOMA) → vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)

In the brain, COMT-dependent dopamine degradation is of particular importance in brain regions with low expression of the presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT), such as the prefrontal cortex (In the PFC, dopamine is also removed by presynaptic norepinephrine transporters (NET) and degraded by monoamine oxidase.). Controversy exists about the predominance and orientation of membrane bound COMT in the CNS, that is, whether this COMT process is active intracellularly in postsynaptic neurons and glia, or oriented outward on the membrane, acting extracellularly on synaptic and extrasynaptic dopamine.

Soluble COMT can also be found extracellularly, although extracellular COMT plays a less significant role in the CNS than it does peripherally. Despite its importance in neurons, COMT is actually primarily expressed in the liver.

==Genetics in humans==

The COMT protein is coded by the gene &quot;COMT&quot;. The gene is associated with allelic variants. The best-studied is Val158Met.
Others are rs737865 and rs165599 that have been studied, e.g., for association with personality traits, response to antidepressant medications, and psychosis risk associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. COMT has been studied as a potential gene in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia; however meta-analyses find no association between the risk of schizophrenia and a number of polymorphisms, including Val158Met.

===Val158Met polymorphism===

A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (a common normal variant) of the gene for catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase results in a valine to methionine mutation at position 158 (Val158Met) rs4680. In vitro, the homozygous Val variant metabolizes dopamine at up to four times the rate of its methionine counterpart. However, in vivo the Met variant is overexpressed in the brain, resulting in a 40% decrease (rather than 75% decrease) in functional enzyme activity. The lower rates of catabolism for the Met allele results in higher synaptic dopamine levels following neurotransmitter release, ultimately increasing dopaminergic stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron. Given the preferential role of COMT in prefrontal dopamine degradation, the Val158Met polymorphism is thought to exert its effects on cognition by modulating dopamine signaling in the frontal lobes.

The gene variant has been shown to affect cognitive tasks broadly related to executive function, such as set shifting, response inhibition, abstract thought, and the acquisition of rules or task structure.

Comparable effects on similar cognitive tasks, the frontal lobes, and the neurotransmitter dopamine have also all been linked to schizophrenia. It has been proposed that an inherited variant of &quot;COMT&quot; is one of the genetic factors that may predispose someone to developing schizophrenia later in life. A more recent study cast doubt on the proposed connection between this gene and any alleged casual effect of cannabis on schizophrenia development.

A non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4680 was found to be associated with depressed factor of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale(PANSS) and efficiency of emotion in schizophrenia subjects. It is increasingly recognised that allelic variation at the COMT gene are also relevant for emotional processing, as they seem to influence the interaction between prefrontal and limbic regions. Research conducted at the Section of Neurobiology of Psychosis, Institute of Psychiatry, King&#x27;s College London has demonstrated an effect of COMT both in patients with bipolar disorder and in their relatives, but these findings have not been replicated so far.

The COMT Val158Met polymorphism also has a pleiotropic effect on emotional processing.
Furthermore, the polymorphism has been shown to affect ratings of subjective well-being. When 621 women were measured with experience sample monitoring, which is similar to mood assessment as response to beeping watch, the met/met form confers double the subjective mental sensation of well-being from a wide variety of daily events. The ability to experience reward increased with the number of Met alleles. Also, the effect of different genotype was greater for events that were felt as more pleasant. The effect size of genotypic moderation was quite large: Subjects with the Val/Val genotype generated almost similar amounts of subjective well-being from a &#x27;very pleasant event&#x27; as Met/Met subjects did from a &#x27;bit pleasant event&#x27;. Genetic variation with functional impact on cortical dopamine tone has a strong influence on reward experience in the flow of daily life. In one study participants with the met/met phenotype described an increase of positive affect twice as high in amplitude as participants with the Val/Val phenotype following very pleasant or pleasant events.

One review found that those with Val/Val tended to be more extroverted, more novelty-seeking, and less neurotic than those with the Met/Met allele

===Temporomandibular joint dysfunction===
Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) does not appear to be a classic genetic disorder, however variations in the gene that codes for COMT have been suggested to be responsible for inheritance of a predisposition to develop TMD during life.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;COMT&quot; is the name given to the gene that codes for this enzyme. The O in the name stands for oxygen, not for &quot;ortho&quot;.

==COMT inhibitors==
COMT inhibitors include entacapone, tolcapone, opicapone, and nitecapone. All except nitecapone are used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Risk of liver toxicity and related digestive disorders restricts the use of tolcapone.

<text>The Connecticut Coyotes were an arena football franchise based in Hartford, Connecticut. The Coyotes played in the Eastern Division of the National Conference in the Arena Football League.

==History==

On June 22, 1994, the Arena Football League awarded the state of Connecticut an expansion franchise, and chose the name &quot;Coyotes&quot; in October of the same year. After a tough first season, in which the Coyotes finished 1-11, team president Robert B. Dixon announced that the team would be up for sale. On October 26, 1995, Connecticut Development Authority sold the Coyotes to Ben Morris and Scott Gerard for $750,000. Morris wasted no time hiring Lary Kuharich to become the second coach in Coyotes history.

However, a horrendous record of only 3 wins in 26 games over 2 seasons led to a disbandment of the team following the 1996 season, after Morris failed to sell the franchise to the Madison Square Garden.

The city of Hartford would receive another team in 1999 when the New York CityHawks became the New England Sea Wolves. However, this team&#x27;s tenure in the city would also be short-lived, as the team moved to Toronto following the 2000 season.

<text>Eoraptor () is a genus of small, lightly built, basal sauropodomorph dinosaur. One of the earliest-known dinosaurs and one of the earliest sauropodomorphs, it lived approximately 231 to 228 million years ago, during the Late Triassic in Western Gondwana, in the region that is now northwestern Argentina. The type and only species, Eoraptor lunensis, was first described in 1993, and is known from an almost complete and well-preserved skeleton and several fragmentary ones. &quot;Eoraptor&quot; had multiple tooth shapes, which suggests that it was omnivorous.

== History of discovery ==
The bones of this primitive dinosaur were first discovered in 1991, by University of San Juan paleontologist Ricardo Martínez, during field work conducted by the University of Chicago and the University of San Juan. The holotype specimen &quot;PVSJ 512&quot; was discovered in muddy siltstone belonging to the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in Argentina. The fossils in this formation were deposited in the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 228 million years ago. It took almost 12 months to collect the holotype, which was then shipped to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago for preparation by William F. Simpson and Bob Masek. The fossil was first put on display in Chicago and was then returned to San Juan, Argentina, where it went on display at the Museum of Natural Sciences.
The genus &quot;Eoraptor&quot; was described and named by Paul Sereno, Catherine Forster, Raymond R. Rogers, and Alfredo M. Monetta in 1993. The name is derived from the Greek word () meaning &#x27;dawn&#x27;, a reference to its primitive nature, and the Latin word meaning &#x27;plunderer&#x27;, a reference to its presumed carnivorous nature and its grasping hand. The specific name &quot;lunensis&quot; is derived from the Latin words (&#x27;moon&#x27;) and the suffix (&#x27;inhabitant&#x27;), a reference to its place of discovery: the (&#x27;Valley of the Moon&#x27;), so named for its arid, otherworldly appearance evocative of a lunar landscape. The type species &quot;Eoraptor lunensis&quot; means &#x27;dawn plunderer from the Valley of the Moon&#x27;.

== Description ==

&quot;Eoraptor&quot; was a small dinosaur, with the known specimens measuring in length, and weighing around or less than . It had a lightly built skull with a slightly enlarged external naris. As in early sauropodomorphs such as &quot;Buriolestes&quot; and &quot;Pampadromaeus&quot; and coelophysoids (which would appear millions of years later), &quot;Eoraptor&quot; had a kink in its upper jaws, between the maxilla and the premaxilla. Paul Sereno &quot;et al&quot;. (2013) observed that the lower jaw had a mid-mandibular joint. It ran digitigrade, and upright on its hind legs. The femur of the holotype specimen PVSJ 512 is , and the tibia is , suggesting that it was a fast runner. Its forelimbs are only half the length of its hindlimbs, suggesting that it was bipedal. All of its long bones have hollow shafts. &quot;Eoraptor&quot; had five digits on each &#x27;hand&#x27;, the three longest of which ended in large claws and were presumably used to handle prey. Scientists have surmised that the fourth and fifth digits were too tiny to be of any use in hunting. The ilium is supported by three sacral vertebrae (atypical of the plesiomorphic two sacrals of basal sauropodomorphs), unlike that of the coeval &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; which is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. &quot;Eoraptor&quot; had vertebral centra that are hollow, a feature present in some of its ancestors.
The original describers, Paul Sereno et al. (1993), supported the notion that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; was an adult specimen based on the closure of sutures in the vertebral column, and the partial fusion of the scapulocoracoid. Bonaparte (1996) interpreted the relatively large orbital opening in the skull as a juvenile trait. Ronald Tykoski agreed (2005) and suggested that certain skull features of the type specimen suggested that it was young, specifically, the skull bones are not completely fused, relatively large orbits, and a short snout. Later Sereno et al. (2013) considered the type specimen as a young adult approaching skeletal maturity, considering that it contained traits of both maturity and immaturity.

According to Sereno &quot;et al&quot;. (1993), &quot;Eoraptor&quot; can be distinguished based on the fact that its premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are leaf-shaped, the external nares are slightly enlarged, and the premaxilla is observed to have a slender posterolateral process. Max Langer and Michael Benton (2006) noted that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; can be distinguished based on the fact that the proximal part of its fibula is extremely transversely compressed.

== Classification ==
In 1993 Paul Sereno and his colleagues described and named &quot;Eoraptor&quot;, and determined it to be one of the earliest dinosaurs. Its age was determined by several factors, not least because it lacked the specialized features of any of the major groups of later dinosaurs, including its lack of specialized predatory features. In 1995, Sereno posited that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; is the earliest-recorded theropod, and is closest to &quot;the hypothetical dinosaurian condition than any other dinosaurian subgroup.&quot; The precise placement of &quot;Eoraptor&quot; within Dinosauria has been unstable, with opinion often varying between a basal saurischian and a basal theropod. When it was first described by Sereno and Forster in 1993, it was regarded as a theropod, based on its &quot;functionally tridactyl hand&quot; and other anatomical features. In 2011, a study conducted by Hans-Dieter Sues, Sterling J. Nesbitt, David S. Berman and Amy C. Henrici featuring a description of &quot;Daemonosaurus&quot;, also concluded that there is now enough fossil evidence to confidently classify &quot;Eoraptor&quot; as a theropod. The study noted that the &quot;transitional suite of character states&quot; of the recently discovered dinosaurs, &quot;Daemonosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tawa&quot; further support that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; is a basal theropod, and not a basal saurischian or a basal sauropodomorph. On the other hand, several studies from 2012 onward have recovered &quot;Eoraptor&quot; as an early sauropodomorph, rather than a theropod. The following phylogenetic tree illustrates the relationships of &quot;Eoraptor&quot; among the major theropod groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s.

Philip Currie (1997) found &quot;Eoraptor&quot; anatomically closer to what would be considered the ancestral morphotype of both saurischian and ornithischian dinosaurs. In 2011, Martinez &quot;et al.&quot; (the team that described &quot;Eodromaeus)&quot; found &quot;Eoraptor&quot; to be a basal sauropodomorph, with characteristic features from the group. Michael Benton expressed his hesitation to this, and claimed that it is &quot;quite a shift&quot; to remove &quot;Eoraptor&quot; from Theropoda and then place it in Sauropodomorpha. A subsequent study by Apaldetti, Martinez, Alcober, and Pol published in 2011 found &quot;Eoraptor&quot; to be a saurischian close to sauropodomorphs and theropods, though was unable to resolve which of the two branches, if either, it fell within. Sereno &quot;et al&quot;. (2013) redescribed the holotype skeleton and concluded that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; was not a theropod but a basal sauropodomorph, consistent with the earlier observation made by Martinez &quot;et al&quot;. (2011).

A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs by Matthew Baron, David Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found &quot;Eoraptor&quot; to be the earliest diverging member of Theropoda, within the larger clade Ornithoscelida. A phylogenetic analysis published with the description of new &quot;Buriolestes&quot; remains in 2018, based on Langer &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) placed &quot;Eoraptor&quot; in a clade of early sauropodomorphs, alongside &quot;Buriolestes&quot;, &quot;Panphagia&quot;, &quot;Pampadromaeus&quot;, and &quot;Saturnalia&quot;.

== Paleobiology ==
&quot;Eoraptor&quot; is thought to have been an omnivore, although its dentition is quite similar to that of &quot;Buriolestes&quot;, which is considered carnivorous. It was a swift sprinter and, upon catching its prey, it would use claws and teeth to tear the prey apart. Unlike later, carnivorous dinosaurs, it lacked a sliding joint at the articulation of the lower jaw, with which to hold large prey. Furthermore, only some of its teeth were curved and saw-edged, unlike those in the mouths of later theropods. The heterodont dentition of &quot;Eoraptor&quot; consists of both serrated, recurved teeth in the upper jaw, like the teeth of theropods, and leaf-shaped teeth in the lower jaw, like the teeth of basal sauropodomorphs. &quot;Eoraptor&quot; had 4 teeth in the premaxilla and 18 teeth in the maxilla, a dental formula not dissimilar to that of &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot;.

== Paleoecology ==

During the Late Triassic period, the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests, with a warm and humid climate, but subject to seasonal variations including strong rainfall. Vegetation consisted of ferns, horsetails, and giant conifers, which formed highland forests along the banks of rivers. &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. Sereno (1993) noted that &quot;Eoraptor&quot; was found in &quot;close association&quot; with therapsids, rauisuchians, archosaurs, &quot;Saurosuchus&quot; and the dinosaurs &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; and &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot;, all of whom lived in its paleoenvironment. Herbivores were represented by rhynchosaurs such as &quot;Hyperodapedon&quot;; aetosaurs; cynodonts like &quot;Chiniquodon&quot;, kannemeyeriid dicynodonts such as &quot;Ischigualastia&quot;; and traversodontids such as &quot;Exaeretodon&quot;. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early dinosaurs. Dinosaur fossils, including those of &quot;Eoraptor&quot; only represent approximately 6% of the total sample that has been recovered from the Ischigualasto Formation (Rogers &quot;et al&quot;., 1993), which suggests that dinosaurs were less numerous than other tetrapods.

<doc id="620630" wikidata="Q6904239" url="?curid=620630" title="Montana Democratic Party">
<text>Montana Democratic Party (MDP) is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the U.S. state of Montana and one of the two major political parties in the state. The party as of 2024 is chaired by Robyn Driscoll. The National Committeeman is Jorge Quintana, and the National Committeewoman is Jean Lemire Dahlman.

==History==
The party typically meets in Butte.

===Recent years===
During a special election for a Congressional seat in 2017, state party officials &quot;grew frustrated&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; when national Democratic Party leaders were implored by Democratic Senator Jon Tester to spend national party money on their candidate Rob Quist, but declined. Quist ultimately lost the seat to Republican Greg Gianforte.

In January 2020, Sandi Luckey, previously the state party treasurer for the Democratic party, was elected executive director of the Montana Democratic Party. Robyn Driscoll was party chair at that time. The state party announced in May 2020 that it was creating a Steering Committee for the Blue Bench Program, and that it would have three of those positions dedicated permanently for Native American leaders. The Blue Bench Program recruited and developed local candidates to run for office. At that time, the state party&#x27;s voting delegates largely consisted of legislative leadership, Democrats in statewide elected office, and leaders in Democratic Central Committees for state countries. The party had no delegate votes assigned specifically for Native Americans, and three voting delegates at state conventions who were Native Americans. The Associated Press reported in June 2020 that the state party voted to establish tribal committees to represent the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, Fort Belknap, Rocky Boy&#x27;s, Blackfeet and Flathead reservations and the Little Shell-Chippewa tribes, and the committees would operate &quot;like county central committees, whose delegates vote on the party&#x27;s platform, rules and officers and nominate candidates for special elections.&quot; Luckey, still the state party executive director, said the move made the Montana Democratic Party the first US state country to formally create a formal role based on population for Native Americans.

In February 2022, Democratic senator Jon Tester criticized the larger state party for not doing more to appeal to and engage with &quot;Middle America,&quot; clarifying he meant the area between the Appalachians the Rocky Mountains.

In June 2022, NPR reported that Montana had two U.S. House districts for the first time since 1992, and while the Montana Democratic Party had three candidates in that month&#x27;s primary, it hadn&#x27;t had representation in the U.S. House since 1994. In August 2022, Montana Democrats meeting in Butte announced a new platform, largely statements of principal, such as supporting abortion rights and declaring a &quot;state of climate emergency.&quot; New policy objectives included restoring the Judicial Nominating Commission, recently eliminated by Republicans, and establishing a panel to examine atrocities at the state&#x27;s former boarding schools for Native Americans. Sheila Hogan remained the state party&#x27;s executive director; the only Democrat in statewide or federal office at the time was Senator Jon Tester.

<doc id="620633" wikidata="Q4849544" url="?curid=620633" title="Seattle Aquarium">
<text>The Seattle Aquarium is a public aquarium in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on Pier 59 on the Elliott Bay waterfront. The aquarium opened in 1977 and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

The aquarium consists of three buildings. Its original buildings at Pier 59 and Pier 60 have six major exhibits. A third building, named the Ocean Pavilion, opened in August 2024. This aquarium consistently participates in educational and conservation programs.

==History==
Plans for a city aquarium, replacing an existing private aquarium, were approved by voters in a 1968 Forward Thrust ballot initiative. The Seattle City Council approved a site near Golden Gardens Park in Ballard in April 1971, but reversed its decision months later following public outcry. A site on the north side of Pier 59 was instead chosen the following year, necessitating the demolition of additional piers, and was originally expected to begin construction in 1974 but was delayed by design revisions. The new aquarium was part of a large redevelopment program for the Alaskan Way promenade, which also included Waterfront Park and viewpoints.

Construction began in early 1975 with the driving of piles into the seabed to support the future aquarium structure. The aquarium opened on May 20, 1977, and attracted 1,524 visitors on its first day. It cost $5.4 million to construct and was initially owned and operated by the City of Seattle&#x27;s Department of Parks and Recreation. The opening ceremonies included the release of salmon fingerlings into Elliott Bay and a three-day festival on the waterfront. Bassetti/Norton/Metler/Rekevics were the architects for the building; the exhibits were designed in consultation with local scientists, including Pacific Science Center director and later governor Dixy Lee Ray.

The aquarium&#x27;s first expansion was announced in 1979 and was followed by a new exhibit in 1986. A $25.4 million expansion was rejected by Seattle voters in 1988 after failing to reach a needed supermajority. On June 22, 2007, an expansion added a gift store and café to the aquarium, as well as two new exhibits: Window on Washington Waters and Crashing Waves. The nonprofit Seattle Aquarium Society—the official 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization for the aquarium—assumed management of the institution from the city on July 1, 2010. The organization signed a 20-year operating agreement with the city government. The aquarium promotes marine conservation and educates over 800,000 visitors each year (including 50,000 students) on the impact of mankind on marine life. It also conducts research in these fields.

===Ocean Pavilion expansion===
The Aquarium Society began planning for a major expansion in 2015 to coincide with the redevelopment of Alaskan Way and the Seattle waterfront following the forthcoming removal of the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The expansion, named the Ocean Pavilion, was announced in 2019 and is centered around a exhibit building. The project includes a new waterfront promenade, which includes an overpass to Pike Place Market, and a tank for sharks and sting rays. The Ocean Pavilion opened on August 29, 2024, and focused on the tropical Coral Triangle region of the Pacific Ocean near Indonesia. The building was designed by LMN Architects and uses a yellow cedar exterior that mimics driftwood. The facility was modified to add sustainable features, including the ability to recirculate 96 percent of its saltwater and manage the temperature of its tanks with a heat exchanger and heat pump.

====Funding====
The city government initially approved $34 million in funding from a real estate excise tax but also contributed a $20 million loan in 2022 to fill an expected shortfall, stemming in part from an increase from the original $113 million estimate. The project was expected to cost $160 million with the majority of funds coming from local taxes, private donations, and other sources. An additional loan of $67 million from PNC Bank was requested by operator Seattle Aquarium Society in 2023 to complete the project. It would require city approval to extend the society&#x27;s contract to 2040 and assume responsibility to pay a termination fee for the loan.

== Exhibits ==
The aquarium&#x27;s exhibits are located in three buildings; Pier 59, Pier 60, and the Ocean Pavilion.

=== Pier 59 ===

Window on Washington Waters is a 120,000-US-gallon (450,000 L) tank created as part of the 2007 expansion. It is meant to replicate the coastal waters of Washington state from about 5 to 60 feet (1.5 to 18.3 m), and features native marine life including salmon, rockfish, and sea anemones. Dive shows take place several times a day, divers wear special masks and converse with visitors.

Life on the Edge is a touch-tank where visitors touch live sea stars, urchins, sea cucumbers, and more. Two large exhibit pools that include touch zones allow visitors to see the tide pool life of Washington&#x27;s outer coast and of Seattle&#x27;s inland sea.

Pacific Coral Reef is a man-made coral reef in a 25,000-US-gallon (95,000 L) tank that contains fish that live in and around reefs. This habitat simulates the unique and diverse reef ecosystem, home to around one quarter of all marine species despite only taking up 0.5% of Earths surface.

The Crashing Waves exhibit is a 40-foot (12 m) wave tank that replicates Washington shores from the intertidal zone to a depth of about 5 feet (1.5 m). This habitat features well adapted intertidal zone marine life such as sea cucumbers, snails, limpets, and more.The Ring of Life features a 12 foot (3.7 m) high glass &quot;donut&quot; where visitors are surrounded by moon jellies.
The Giant Pacific Octopus is native to the Puget Sound and more broadly found in waters from California to Alaska and across the Pacific to Japan. The Seattle aquarium&#x27;s octopus resides in a circular tank for viewing of the octopus - and the tank&#x27;s other residents - from all angles.

A Closer Look Table has learning experiences regarding various aquatic creatures that changes frequently.

Caring Cove Play Space is a child friendly play space where kids and accompanying adults dress up, play with plush marine animals, explore faux tide pools, and read.

A Virtual Reality Experience is offered every 15 minutes.

=== Pier 60 ===
The Underwater Dome is a 260-degree exhibit viewed from a mostly transparent spherical undersea room in a 400,000-US-gallon (1,500,000 L) tank. It was built as part of the original construction and opened in 1977. The tank exhibits hundreds of species that would be found in Puget Sound including salmon, lingcod, sharks, sturgeon, skates, and rockfish.

Birds and Shores is an open-air habitat housing Puget Sound natives such as tufted puffins, rhinoceros auklets, common murres, and black oystercatchers. The habitat includes tidal pools and rocky cliffs above the water that support these coastal birds&#x27; natural breeding habits.

The Marine Mammals area includes exhibits for harbor seals, Northern fur seals, sea otters, and river otters. This exhibit offers visibility into these mammals&#x27; underwater world as well as their land habitat. Activities include frequent presentations and feedings.

Puget Sound Fish is a three-part exhibit that contains fish from the Puget Sound, broken into eelgrass communities, deep sandy bottoms, and rocky areas. Fish included in the tank are grunt sculpins, Pacific spiny lumpsuckers, midshipman fish, and armored sturgeon poachers.

Salmon Life Cycle highlights salmon and their stages of development. This learning experience is informative of this keystone species that is integral to Puget Sound ecosystems and holds importance to Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest.

A window into the Veterinary Care Center allows visitors to watch marine life examinations by veterinary staff in the clinic.

Murals created by Ray Troll, Grace Freeman and Marvin E. Oliver, including two new murals introduced in 2023, cover the walls of the Marine Mammals enclosure.

=== Ocean Pavilion ===
The Ocean Pavilion features a tank for sharks and sting rays. The tank exhibits hundreds of species that would be found in the &#x27;Coral Triangle&#x27; of Indonesia. The new multistory exhibit features several interpretive areas, including The Reef, The Archipelago, One Ocean Hall, At Home in the Ocean, an Animal Care Area, and a Discovery Lab. The Reef features a large immersive window into the exhibit tank, and At Home in the Ocean features smaller tanks and exhibits, including one for garden eels.

== Conservation and research ==

The Seattle Aquarium has participated in conservation efforts of various marine species by collaborating with indigenous peoples, governments, institutions, and companies.

In 2020, the Seattle Aquarium cofounded ReShark, an international conservation coalition, aiding in the recovery of zebra sharks in Indonesia. One completed, the Ocean Pavilion will provide breeding resources for the sharks and support a small group prior to their release into their natural habitat. This program, with partners in 15 countries and 44 aquariums, plans to release 500 zebra shark pups in Raja Ampat, Indonesia as of 2023.

In 2021, the aquarium began to rear larval and juvenile pinto abalones, planning to release them each spring after 2022 into designated sites around the San Juan Islands and Strait of Juan de Fuca. These endangered species have faced a 97% decline, studies in the San Juan Islands show.

==Educational efforts==

The Seattle Aquarium offers educational programs for students through high school. These include self guided educational programs that include group discounted rates, educational clinics, digital learning options, a high school volunteer program, and other programs and contests to promote hands-on learning. During the pandemic induced school closures of 2020, the aquarium donated packages that included magnifying glasses and lessons to support distanced learning, along with offering online educational content. The aquarium has hosted and educated an estimated 2 million children at their programs since their implementation.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized Seattle Aquarium is prominently featured in the 2020 action-adventure game &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;.

<text>A glee club is a musical group or choir group, historically of male voices but also of female or mixed voices, which traditionally specializes in the singing of short songs by trios or quartets. In the late 19th century it was very popular in most schools and was made a tradition to have in American high schools from then on.

Glee clubs were named after a form of English part song, called a glee, which they typically sang. The first named Glee Club held its initial meeting in the Newcastle Coffee House in London in 1787. Glee clubs were very popular in Britain from then until the mid-1850s but by then they were gradually being superseded by larger choral societies. By the mid-20th century, proper &quot;glee&quot; clubs were no longer common.

Testifying to the importance of glee clubs in 19th Century America, Henry Stone, a Union veteran of the American Civil War, recalled that &quot;A glee club came down from Chicago, bringing with them the new song, &quot;We&#x27;ll rally &#x27;round the flag, boys&quot; (Battle Cry of Freedom), and it ran through the camp like wildfire. The effect was little short of miraculous. It put as much spirit and cheer into the army as a victory.&quot;

The term remains in contemporary use, for show choirs established in North American colleges, universities, and high schools, although most American glee clubs are choruses in the standard sense, and rarely perform &quot;glees&quot;.

<doc id="620635" wikidata="Q110106" url="?curid=620635" title="Julius Axelrod">
<text>Julius Axelrod (May 30, 1912 – December 29, 2004) was an American biochemist. He won a share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970 along with Bernard Katz and Ulf von Euler. The Nobel Committee honored him for his work on the release and reuptake of catecholamine neurotransmitters, a class of chemicals in the brain that include epinephrine, norepinephrine, and, as was later discovered, dopamine. Axelrod also made major contributions to the understanding of the pineal gland and how it is regulated during the sleep-wake cycle.

==Education and early life==
Axelrod was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, Molly (née Leichtling) and Isadore Axelrod, a basket weaver. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology from the College of the City of New York in 1933. Axelrod wanted to become a physician, but was rejected from every medical school to which he applied. He worked briefly as a laboratory technician at New York University, then in 1935 he got a job with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene testing vitamin supplements added to food. While working at the Department of Health, he attended night school and received his master&#x27;s in sciences degree from New York University in 1941.

==Research==

===Analgesic research===
In 1946, Axelrod took a position working under Bernard Brodie at Goldwater Memorial Hospital. The research experience and mentorship Axelrod received from Brodie would launch him on his research career. Brodie and Axelrod&#x27;s research focused on how analgesics (pain-killers) work. During the 1940s, users of non-aspirin analgesics were developing a blood condition known as methemoglobinemia. Axelrod and Brodie discovered that acetanilide, the main ingredient of these pain-killers, was to blame. They found that one of the metabolites also was an analgesic. They recommended that this metabolite, acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol), be used instead.

===Catecholamine research===

In 1949, Axelrod began work at the National Heart Institute, forerunner of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He examined the mechanisms and effects of caffeine, which led him to an interest in the sympathetic nervous system and its main neurotransmitters, epinephrine and norepinephrine. During this time, Axelrod also conducted research on codeine, morphine, methamphetamine, and ephedrine and performed some of the first experiments on LSD. Realizing that he could not advance his career without a PhD, he took a leave of absence from the NIH in 1954 to attend George Washington University Medical School. Allowed to submit some of his previous research toward his degree, he graduated one year later, in 1955. Axelrod then returned to the NIH and began some of the key research of his career.

Axelrod received his Nobel Prize for his work on the release, reuptake, and storage of the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine, also known as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Working on monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in 1957, Axelrod showed that catecholamine neurotransmitters do not merely stop working after they are released into the synapse. Instead, neurotransmitters are recaptured (&quot;reuptake&quot;) by the pre-synaptic nerve ending, and recycled for later transmissions. He theorized that epinephrine is held in tissues in an inactive form and is liberated by the nervous system when needed. This research laid the groundwork for later selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac, which block the reuptake of another neurotransmitter, serotonin.

In 1958, Axelrod also discovered and characterized the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase, which is involved in the breakdown of catecholamines.

===Pineal gland research===
Some of Axelrod&#x27;s later research focused on the pineal gland. He and his colleagues showed that the hormone melatonin is generated from tryptophan, as is the neurotransmitter serotonin. The rates of synthesis and release follows the body&#x27;s circadian rhythm driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus within the hypothalamus. Axelrod and colleagues went on to show that melatonin had wide-ranging effects throughout the central nervous system, allowing the pineal gland to function as a biological clock. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. He continued to work at the National Institute of Mental Health at the NIH until his death in 2004.

Many of his papers and awards are held at the National Library of Medicine.

==Awards and honors==
Axelrod was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1967 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1979. In 1992, he was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.

==Personal life==
Axelrod injured his left eye when an ammonia bottle in the lab exploded; he would wear an eyepatch for the rest of his life. Although he became an atheist early in life and resented the strict upbringing of his parents&#x27; religion, he identified with Jewish culture and joined several international fights against anti-Semitism. His wife of 53 years, Sally Taub Axelrod, died in 1992.
At his death, on December 29, 2004, he was survived by two sons, Paul and Alfred, and three grandchildren.

===Political views===
After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1970, Axelrod used his visibility to advocate several science policy issues. In 1973 U.S. President Richard Nixon created an agency with the specific goal of curing cancer. Axelrod, along with fellow Nobel-laureates Marshall W. Nirenberg and Christian Anfinsen, organized a petition by scientists opposed to the new agency, arguing that by focusing solely on cancer, public funding would not be available for research into other, more solvable, medical problems. Axelrod also lent his name to several protests against the imprisonment of scientists in the Soviet Union.
Axelrod was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Federation of American Scientists and the International Academy of Science, Munich.

<doc id="620636" wikidata="Q3120160" url="?curid=620636" title="Theophilus Shepstone">
<text>Sir Theophilus Shepstone (8 January 181723 June 1893) was a British South African statesman who was responsible for the annexation of the Transvaal to Britain in 1877. Shepstone is the great-great-grandfather of international artist Conor Mccreedy.

==Early life==
Theophilus Shepstone was born at Westbury-on-Trym near Bristol, England. When he was three years old his father, the Rev. William Theophilus, emigrated to Cape Colony. Young Shepstone was educated at the native mission stations at which his father worked, and the boy acquired great proficiency in the indigenous languages of South Africa, a circumstance which determined his career. In the Xhosa War of 1835 he served as headquarters interpreter on the staff of the governor, Sir Benjamin d&#x27;Urban, and at the end of the campaign remained on the frontier as clerk to the agent for the local tribes.

==Natal==
In 1838 he was one of the party sent from Cape Colony to occupy Port Natal on behalf of Britain. This force was recalled in 1839 when Shepstone was appointed British resident among the Fengu and other tribes in Kaffraria. Here he remained until the definite establishment of British rule in Natal and its organisation as an administrative entity, when Shepstone was made (1845) agent for the native tribes. In 1848 he became captain-general of the native levies; in 1855 judicial assessor in native causes; and, in 1856, on the remodelling of the Natal government, secretary for native affairs and a member of the executive and legislative councils. This position he held until 1877.

Thus for over thirty years, he was the director of native policy in Natal. A man of strong will and pronounced views, he gained a great influence over the indigenous people, by whom he was called &quot;father old man,&quot; and given the nickname &quot;Somtseu&quot; (a famed black hunter) by the Zulus, allegedly when he fled before an elephant, but more likely in childhood. The main line of his policy was to maintain tribal customs as far as consistent with principles of humanity, and not to attempt to force the civilisation. The result of his policy remained traceable for some time in the condition and status of the Natal peoples. While he remained in charge there was but one serious revolt—that of Langalibalele in 1873 against a demand that guns be registered.

Shepstone&#x27;s influence with the Zulus was made use of by the Natal government; in 1861 he visited the Zulu Kingdom and obtained from Mpande a public recognition of Cetshwayo as his successor. Twelve years later Shepstone attended the proclamation of Cetshwayo as king, the Zulu chief promising Shepstone to live at peace with his neighbours. In 1874 and again in 1876 Shepstone travelled to London on colonial affairs.

==Transvaal==
When in London in 1876 Shepstone was entrusted by the 4th earl of Carnarvon, then secretary of state for the colonies, with a special commission to confer with the Transvaal executive on the question of the federation of the South African states, and given power, should he deem it necessary, to annex the country, subject to the confirmation of the British government.

Shepstone went to Pretoria in January 1877, and on 12 April issued a proclamation announcing the establishment of British authority over the Transvaal. Shepstone&#x27;s force consisted of twenty-five men of the Natal Mounted Police only, but no overt opposition was made to the annexation; the republic at the time was in a condition bordering on anarchy. &quot;Nothing but annexation,&quot; wrote Sir Theophilus to the Colonial Office, &quot;will or can save the state, and nothing else can save South Africa from the direst consequences. All the thinking and intelligent people know this, and will be thankful to be delivered from the thraldom of petty factions by which they are perpetually kept in a state of excitement and unrest because the government and everything connected with it is a thorough sham&quot; (Martineau&#x27;s &quot;Life of Sir Bartle Frere&quot;, ch. 18). Shepstone&#x27;s action has been condemned as premature. He had, however, reason to believe that if Britain remained inactive, Germany would be induced to undertake the protection of the Transvaal.

Moreover, had the policy of self-government for the Boers which he outlined in his annexation proclamation been carried out, the revolt of 1880–81 might not have occurred. Shepstone remained in Pretoria as administrator of the Transvaal until January 1879; his rule was marked, according to Sir Bartle Frere, who described him as &quot;a singular type of an Africander Talleyrand,&quot; by an &quot;apparent absence of all effort to devise or substitute a better system&quot; than that which had characterised the previous regime. Shepstone had been summoned home to advise the Colonial Office on South African affairs and he reached England in May 1879; on his return to Natal he retired (1880) from the public service. In 1883, however, he was commissioned to replace Cetshwayo as king in Zululand. He was active in church matters in Natal, and was, prior to the Langalibalele &quot;rebellion&quot;, a close friend of Bishop Colenso. The two men, though, became estranged following Colenso&#x27;s gradual realisation that Shepstone exerted a malign influence on Zulu affairs. Shepstone opposed the grant of self-government to Natal. He died at Pietermaritzburg on 23 June 1893.

Although Shepstone&#x27;s life and work have at times been celebrated by Britons and South Africans, experts on the period such as South African historian Jeff Guy implicate him in building a conspiracy to promote the invasion of the Zulu kingdom and its dismemberment by forces from Natal and the Transvaal. His motive seems to have been both to fill the increasing demand for labour in Natal colony and to win back the friendship of the Transvaal government.

==Family==
In 1833 Shepstone married Maria, daughter of Charles Palmer, commissary-general at Cape Town; they had six sons and three daughters. One of his sons was killed at the Battle of Isandlwana; of the other sons H. C. Shepstone (born 1840) was secretary for native affairs in Natal from 1884 to 1893; Theophilus was adviser to the Swazis (1887–1891); and A. J. Shepstone (born 1852) served in various native expeditions, as assistant-commissioner in Zululand, in the South African War, 1899–1902, and became in 1909 secretary for native affairs (Natal) and secretary of the Natal native trust. A younger brother of Sir Theophilus, John Wesley Shepstone (born 1827), filled between 1846 and 1896 various offices in Natal in connection with the administration of native affairs.

<text>The 2004 San Marino Grand Prix (officially the Gran Premio Foster&#x27;s di San Marino 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 25 April 2004 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, Imola. It was Race 4 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 62-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari. BAR-Honda driver Jenson Button finished second after starting from pole position with Juan Pablo Montoya third in a Williams-BMW

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

==Report==
=== Background ===
The 2004 San Marino Grand Prix marked the 10th anniversary of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accidents in 1994.

=== Qualifying ===
Qualifying gave BAR&#x27;s Jenson Button his maiden career pole position, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Juan Pablo Montoya, Rubens Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher. Both Giancarlo Fisichella and Kimi Räikkönen failed to set a time in the session, leaving them at the back of the grid. Rain fell on the Imola circuit overnight, washing away much of the rubber that had been laid down over the weekend, theoretically handing the advantage to teams with Bridgestone tyres.

=== Race ===
On race day it was warm and sunny, and the circuit was completely dry for the start of the race. As the lights went out, Button got away well, leading the field through the first corners. At the first chicane, David Coulthard locked his brakes and ran into the back of Fernando Alonso, dislodging Coulthard&#x27;s front wing and sending the Scot into the gravel trap. He rejoined the track, but was already a long way behind and was forced to pit to repair the damage. Meanwhile, Montoya attempted to pass Michael Schumacher around the outside of the Tosa corner, with Schumacher squeezing Montoya onto the grass and forcing the pair to touch wheels as they exited the corner. Later, Schumacher explained that he could not see Montoya beside him. The incident caused Montoya to lose momentum, and fall back towards his teammate Ralf Schumacher. As the German attempted to pass Montoya, the Colombian forced him across the track and onto the slippery grass, where Ralf Schumacher kept his foot on the throttle, but was forced to yield the position, and lost another position to Takuma Sato.

At the end of the first lap, Button had built a good lead over Michael Schumacher, Montoya, Sato, Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. Michael Schumacher closed the gap quickly though, putting in consecutive fastest laps to put pressure on Button. The pair pulled away from the field easily, both lapping at nearly 1 second faster than every other driver. On lap 4, Coulthard, still struggling at the back of the field, went off track momentarily to short-cut the chicane. Cristiano da Matta and Felipe Massa became the first drivers to pit on lap 7, Massa dropping from 11th to 14th, but taking a position from da Matta due to his faster stop. Giorgio Pantano became the first retirement of the race, going off track thanks to a hydraulics failure. Lap 8 saw Montoya become the first front-runner to stop, followed into the pits by Mark Webber. Button showed that his qualifying effort was mainly due to a lighter fuel load, stopping on lap 9 to release Michael Schumacher, who immediately started to lap faster. Ralf Schumacher, Olivier Panis and Christian Klien also made their first stops on lap 9. Sato and Barrichello pitted on lap 10, but Barrichello&#x27;s faster stop allowed the Brazilian to get ahead as they exited the pits. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s stop came on lap 11, but he had built up enough of a lead over Button to emerge well ahead. Jarno Trulli, momentarily in second place, pitted on lap 12, with fast work by the Renault team allowing him to take 4th position from Ralf Schumacher. Nick Heidfeld was the last of the three-stoppers to make his stop on lap 14, leaving Fisichella and Räikkönen, in 9th and 10th as the only drivers not to make a pit stop.

Barrichello, with a clearly faster car, closed up on Ralf Schumacher, but was unable to pass for several laps as Michael Schumacher built up a 12-second lead at the end of 18 laps. Coulthard, who had been switched to a two-stop strategy due to his first lap collision, made his stop on lap 19, with Fisichella following on lap 20, then Räikkönen on lap 21. Meanwhile, Massa took 11th place from Jaguar&#x27;s Mark Webber, the Australian suffering a misfire in his Cosworth engine. Cristiano da Matta was again the first to pit in the second round of stops, refuelling on lap 23, followed by Webber and Massa the following lap. Minardi&#x27;s Gianmaria Bruni entered the pits, with the team engineers apparently unprepared for his stop. Soon later he retired from the race, citing a continuously locking rear brake, which made the car difficult to drive. Montoya stopped on lap 25, falling back from 3rd to 7th, followed by Button on lap 26, who was able to retain his 2nd position. Michael Schumacher pitted from the lead on lap 27, easily retaining his position, with an 18-second lead. Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello and Sato all pitted on the following lap, which saw Schumacher just retain his position ahead of Barrichello, the pair nearly colliding as Schumacher was released from his pit area. Fernando Alonso then pitted on lap 30, rejoining behind Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello, who were still close together on the circuit. Trulli then stopped the following lap, splitting Schumacher and Barrichello to take fifth.

da Matta was served with a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags, but made a mistake and went off track soon after, ending his race. After 35 laps, Button was able to find some pace, but not enough to significantly reduce Schumacher&#x27;s lead, which stood at 16.4 seconds. Both Sauber drivers, on different strategies, took their final stops on lap 38. Coulthard made his second and final stop for the day on lap 40, leaving him in 14th position. Räikkönen, in the other McLaren was also struggling in the midfield, but hopeful to pick up his first point of the year, pitted on lap 41. The final round of pitstops for the frontrunners began on lap 43, with Montoya and Barrichello pitting, followed by Button and Ralf Schumacher on lap 44, then Michael Schumacher and Trulli on lap 46. Trulli kept his position ahead of Barrichello, before Alonso&#x27;s stop on lap 48 saw the Spaniard move ahead of both Barrichello and Trulli, into 5th position. Alonso began pressuring Ralf Schumacher, and on lap 51, attempted an overtaking move on the inside of Tosa, which saw the pair collide, sending Schumacher into a spin and dropping him down to 7th. The stewards announced the incident would be investigated after the race. Heidfeld retired from the race with a transmission problem, as Alonso moved in on Montoya and Barrichello got closer to Trulli.

Sato retired from the race with a spectacular Honda engine failure with 6 laps remaining, possibly causing worry for teammate Button, who was in 2nd position. The retirement moved Räikkönen into 8th, eyeing his first point for the 2004 season. Michael Schumacher cruised to the finish line to win his fourth race of the year, with Button in 2nd, and Montoya holding on to the final podium spot ahead of Alonso. Trulli survived an attack by Barrichello on the final lap to hold on to 5th, with Ralf Schumacher and Räikkönen closing out the pointscorers. The result continued Michael Schumacher&#x27;s perfect start to the year, with a maximum 40 points from the first four races. Teammate Barrichello held on to second with 24 points, just ahead of the surprise package Button, on 23. The constructors championship underlined Ferrari&#x27;s incredible early dominance, with the Italian team on 64, over double the score of second-placed Renault, on 31, followed by both Williams and BAR on 27.

<text>Horní Benešov (; until 1926 Benešov; ) is a town in Bruntál District in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,200 inhabitants. Horní Benešov has a long mining tradition.

==Administrative division==

Horní Benešov consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Horní Benešov (1,861)
*Luhy (315)

==Geography==
Horní Benešov is located about east of Bruntál and west of Opava. It lies in the Nízký Jeseník range. The highest point is at above sea level.

==History==
The first written mention of Horní Benešov is from 1226, when it was a mining settlement. The silver mines were one of the oldest in Czech lands. The town of Benešov was founded on the site of the settlement in 1253, and the town rights were confirmed in 1271 by King Ottokar II.

The town was destroyed by a Hungarian invasion in 1474 and then during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The mining was in decline since 17th century. During the 19th and 20th centuries, economic development of Benešov was driven mostly by textile industry.

According to the Austrian administration census of 1910 the town had 3,826 inhabitants, 3,800 (99.9%) were German-speaking. Most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 3,766 (98.4%), followed by Protestants with 30 (0.8%) and the Jews with 25 (0.6%).

Before World War I, the town was part of the Austrian Silesia region. After World War I, the town was within the state of Czechoslovakia and in 1926 was given its present name. From 1938 to 1945 Horní Benešov was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. After the war, the German population was expelled.

In 1902–1914 and in 1951–1992, baryte was mined here.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/11 road (the section from Opava to Bruntál) passes through the town.

==Sights==

The main landmark of Horní Benešov is the Church of Saint Catherine. It was built in the Neoclassical style in 1719. It has preserved elements from the original building from the 16th century.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Horní Benešov is twinned with:
* Pszów, Poland

<doc id="620644" wikidata="Q5461235" url="?curid=620644" title="Florida Bobcats">
<text>The Florida Bobcats were an Arena Football League (AFL) team based in Sunrise, Florida. They were previously known as the Sacramento Attack and the Miami Hooters, and played in the AFL for a total of ten seasons, the last seven in West Palm Beach and Sunrise in the Miami metropolitan area.

The team was founded in 1992 as the Sacramento Attack, based in Sacramento, California. After their first season they relocated to Miami as the Miami Hooters, so named through a marketing deal with the restaurant chain Hooters. After three seasons the Hooters sponsorship was dropped and the team moved north to Sunrise where it changed its name. They folded after the 2001 season after years of weak attendance and poor performance. During their run they made two playoff appearances, once in Sacramento and once in Miami.

==History==

===Sacramento Attack (1992)===
The Sacramento Attack was an Arena Football League team that competed under that name in the 1992 AFL season only. They played at ARCO Arena (later Sleep Train Arena) for that season. The team was originally supposed to play in Los Angeles as the Los Angeles Wings, but the franchise never came into existence in Los Angeles, and moved to Sacramento, California as the Attack.

===Miami Hooters (1993–1995)===
After their inaugural season, the team relocated to Miami, Florida. They took the name Miami Hooters in an unusual marketing arrangement with the Florida-based restaurant chain Hooters, which was ordinarily more noted for its buxom waitresses than feats of athletic prowess. Naturally, the team adopted the restaurant&#x27;s owlish logo and trademark colors as its own for three years, until this unusual arrangement terminated after the completion of the 1995 season. Desirous of staying in the general South Florida area, the team relocated to West Palm Beach as the Florida Bobcats. Subsequent linking of team names with products was to occur, notably the AFL&#x27;s own New Jersey Red Dogs (named for a Miller-owned beer brand), the Toronto Phantoms (named for Phantom Industries, a manufacturer of women&#x27;s hosiery), the Los Angeles Kiss (named for the band KISS, which owned the team) and the Detroit Neon of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. Originally the team was to be named the Miami Toros or Miami Bulls, with a similar logo for each name having been created.

===Florida Bobcats (1996–2001)===
When the Miami Hooters team discontinued its connection with the Hooters Restaurant chain after the 1995 season, it developed both a new identity (the Bobcats) and a new color scheme involving teal and black as opposed to the former orange and brown associated with the restaurants. It also moved north to West Palm Beach in an attempt to reduce overhead. This proved to be a mixed blessing at best, however, as the relatively tiny seating capacity of the West Palm Beach Auditorium (around 6,000) made profitable operations essentially impossible. In the 1997 and 1998 seasons the team played a total of five official league games at neutral sites (in Ottawa, Boston, Los Angeles, Kansas City and Lakeland, Florida), drawing an average crowd of 5,365 -- quite an improvement over the 3,446 per game they drew in their thirteen games in West Palm Beach. This led to some wags referring to Bobcats as &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot;, an ironic comparison to the National Football League&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys. 

In 1999, the Bobcats moved into the far more spacious confines of the National Car Rental Center, also home to the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League. Despite having over 20,000 seats in the new arena, the Bobcats attendance did not improve -- it actually &quot;dropped&quot; to an average of 3,424 in 21 home games. (The Bobcats even set the AFL all-time low attendance mark, when only 1,154 fans watched them beat the Los Angeles Avengers, 61-53, on May 3, 2001.) The club remained there until the team was folded after the completion of the 2001 season. One of the notable facts about this team is that they were quarterbacked through the majority of their existence by Fred McNair, the original &quot;Air McNair&quot; and older brother of 2003 NFL co-MVP Steve McNair. An attempt was made in the 2001 season to sell the team to various prospective owners, including Mark Cuban, who later bought the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA, but nothing came of the deal.

<doc id="620653" wikidata="Q205704" url="?curid=620653" title="Apollodorus of Athens">
<text>Apollodorus of Athens (, &quot;Apollodoros ho Athenaios&quot;; c. 180 BC – after 120 BC), son of Asclepiades, was a Greek scholar, historian, and grammarian. He was a pupil of Diogenes of Babylon, Panaetius the Stoic, and the grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace, under whom he appears to have studied together with his contemporary Dionysius Thrax. He left (perhaps fled) Alexandria around 146 BC, most likely for Pergamon, and eventually settled in Athens.

==Literary works==
* &quot;Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Χρονικά&quot;, &quot;Chronika&quot;), a Greek history in verse from the fall of Troy in the 12th century BC to roughly 143 BC (although later it was extended as far as 109 BC), and based on previous works by Eratosthenes of Cyrene. Its dates are reckoned by its references to the archons of Athens. As most archons only held office for one year, scholars have been able to pin down the years to which Apollodorus was referring. The poem is written in comic trimeters and is dedicated to the second-century BC king of Pergamon, Attalus II Philadelphus.
* &quot;On the Gods&quot; (&quot;Περὶ θεῶν&quot;, &quot;Peri theon&quot;, prose, in 24 books), lost but known through quotes to have included etymologies of the names and epithets of the gods, rifled and quoted by the Roman Epicurean Philodemus; further fragments appear in Oxyrhynchus Papyri.
* A twelve-book essay about Homer&#x27;s Catalogue of Ships, also based on Eratosthenes of Cyrene and Demetrius of Scepsis, dealing with Homeric geography and how it has changed along the centuries. Strabo relied greatly on this for books 8 through 10 of his own &quot;Geographica&quot;.
* Other possible works include an early (possibly the earliest by an Alexandrian writer), and analyses of the poets Epicharmus of Kos and Sophron.
* Apollodorus produced numerous other critical and grammatical writings, which have not survived.
* His eminence as a scholar gave rise to several imitations, forgeries and misattributions. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (or &quot;Library&quot;), an encyclopedia of Greek mythology, was traditionally attributed to him; it was not written by him, however, as it cites Castor the Annalist, a contemporary of Cicero, providing a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; after the time of Apollodorus. As a result, the author of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; is often referred to as &quot;Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot;.

<doc id="620655" wikidata="Q379288" url="?curid=620655" title="Kulning">
<text>Kulning, also known as the Nordic herding call, refers to high-pitched herding calls that were developed centuries ago in Norway and Sweden. Different regions have different names for these calls, such as &quot;kauka&quot;, &quot;lålla&quot;, &quot;kula&quot;, &quot;kulokk&quot;, and &quot;lockrop&quot;. These calls are part of Scandinavian herding music.

The songs and calls were used to guide the movement of livestock in the wilderness and to communicate inbetween farms.

Kulning consists of high-pitched, directed, non-vibrato calls, sometimes ending on a high note and sometimes on a low note. The melodies are often beautifully ornamented with the melancholy typical of Nordic folk music. Kulning also includes various lower-pitched calls and sounds that mimic animal sounds or are designed to catch the attention of animals.

Kulning was typically used mostly by women and girls, but also by some men.

== Acoustic characteristics ==
The song has a high-pitched vocal technique, i.e. a loud call using head tones, so that it can be heard or be used to communicate over long distances. It has a fascinating and haunting tone, often conveying a feeling of sadness, in large part because the &quot;kulokks&quot; often include typical half-tones and quarter-tones (also known as &quot;blue tones&quot;) found in the music of the region. Linguist and phonetician Robert Eklund, speech therapist Anita McAllister and kulning singer and speech therapist Fanny Pehrson studied the difference between kulning voice production and head voice (sometimes also somewhat erroneously referred to as falsetto voice) production in both indoors (normal and anechoic rooms) and in an ecologically valid outdoor setting near Dalarna, Sweden. The song analyzed was the same in all cases, and was performed by the same kulning singer (Pehrson). Comparing kulning to head voice, they found that partials were visible in far higher registers in kulning than in head voice (easily observed up to 16 kHz) and that they were also less affected by an increased distance from the source than head voice, with more or less unaffected partial patterns when comparing a distance of 11 meters from the source, compared to 1 meter from the source. In the outdoor setting, they also found that head voice production exhibited a 25.2 dB decrease at 11 meters from the source, compared to 1 meter from the source, while the corresponding amplitude decrease in kulning was only 9.4 dB, which is a clear indication that kulning is well-suited to carry over long distances in an outdoor setting. Or, as the authors summarize the findings:It was shown that kulning fell off less with distance from an intensity point of view, and also that partials in kulning—but not in head voice—remained more or less unperturbed 11 meters from the singer, as compared to 1 meter from the singer. Both results help explain why kulning as a singing mode was developed for calling cattle that might be at considerable distance from the singer.

== Function and physiological characteristics ==
When a call is made in a valley, it rings and echoes against the mountains. The animals, a number of whom wear bells tuned so that the livestock&#x27;s location can be heard, begin to respond to the call, answering back and the sound of the bells indicates that they are moving down the mountain towards their home farm. The &quot;kulokks&quot; can belong to an individual, but are sometimes family-based and are handed down so that a family&#x27;s cows know they are being called and thus respond. A number of calls contain names of individual (sometimes the &quot;lead&quot;) animals, as herds are not very large.

A study done by Finnish and Swedish universities showed that kulning, as compared to falsetto, exhibits a better contact of the vocal folds and a longer glottal closure in the phonation cycle. Using nasofiberendoscopy also showed medial and anteroposterior narrowing of the laryngeal inlet and approximation of the false vocal folds in kulning.

== Comparison with other regional song traditions ==
In comparison with other song traditions used in northern Scandinavia, e.g. joik, there is no evidence that kulning has been used in religious rituals or for other purposes. It has been used on farms in stock-raising since medieval times. The tradition is still alive today, although waning. Kulning is, however, similar to yodeling, a singing style also developed for long-distance sound propagation.

== Comparison with herdcalling songs in other countries ==
In France, briolage is a set of &quot;techniques of calls and exhortations to the ploughing animals in most cases, intended to guide them.&quot;

== Kulning used in music ==

Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg based a few of his classical music compositions for piano and for orchestra on kulokker that he had heard. An early Norwegian opera includes a soprano aria that is half aria and half kulning. 

Kulning features in the music of some Scandinavian folk groups, for example Heilung, Gjallarhorn and Frifot (featuring singer Lena Willemark).

The song &quot;Ulveham&quot; by Norwegian band Gåte, which they&#x27;re competing with at Eurovision Song Contest 2024, includes a kulning vocalisation on the chorus.

The kulning is sung throughout in the opera &quot;La Reine Garçon&quot; by Québécois composer Julien Bilodeau, a production collaborated between Opéra de Montréal and the Canadian Opera Company.

==Kulning in the media==
There are also other examples of kulning to be found in other forms of modern media:
* Vocalist Christine Hals provided traditional Norwegian kulning for the soundtracks of the films &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), and as a voice actress in action-adventure video game God of War Ragnarök. 
* In the song &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; for the 2019 film &quot;Frozen II&quot;, Norwegian singer Aurora&#x27;s vocals are inspired by kulning.
* Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s film &quot;Offret&quot; (&quot;The Sacrifice&quot; – Sweden, 1986) features kulning in its soundtrack.
* TV series &quot;Vikings&quot; features aggressive kulning during some battle scenes.
* The 2013 videogame &quot; &quot; features kulning in its soundtrack.
* A 2019 episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot; features Daphne Blake and singer Sia at a kulning workshop in Sweden.

<doc id="620656" wikidata="Q7130544" url="?curid=620656" title="Pandebono">
<text>Pandebono or pan de bono is a type of Colombian bread made of cassava starch, cheese, eggs, and in some regions of the country, guava paste. Traditionally, it is consumed with hot chocolate, still warm a few minutes after baking. It is very popular in the Colombian department of Valle del Cauca. This bread can be made in both a round and a ring shape.

==Etymology==
The version documented by Edouard André in &quot;Equinoctial America&quot; published in &quot;Picturesque America&quot; is that there was a place called &quot;Hacienda El Bono&quot; on the road between Dagua and Cali where this product was first prepared. In this hacienda, a bread was made that was consumed by the muleteers who passed by on their way to Buenaventura, and everyone knew it as &#x27;El pan de El Bono&#x27; (the bread of El Bono). Oral tradition merged the terms to popularize it as &#x27;pandebono&#x27;.

The somewhat valid historical records suggest that it was Genoveva, the matron-cook of Hacienda El Bono, who, in an attempt to enhance the nutritional and sensory value of traditional bread, added cassava starch, then corn, and cheese. Moreover, for the day laborers, pandebono represented a more substantial food, midway between a snack and a meal, capable of lasting all day in their satchels.

<doc id="620660" wikidata="Q5634574" url="?curid=620660" title="HMS Tartar (F133)">
<text>HMS &quot;Tartar&quot; (F133) was a Tribal-class frigate of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Tartar people, most of whom were located in Asia and Eastern Europe. She was sold to the Indonesian Navy in 1984 as KRI &quot;Hasanuddin&quot; (333).

&quot;Tartar&quot; was built by Devonport Dockyard, at a cost of £4,140,000. She was launched on 19 September 1960 and commissioned on 26 February 1962.

==Service history==
===Royal Navy===

While in the West Indies in 1963, &quot;Tartar&quot; provided support to Trinidad after Hurricane Flora struck the Caribbean. In early December, &quot;Tartar&quot;″s crew apprehended nine armed Cubans on board a ship off Cay Sal, Bahamas, where an arms cache was discovered by a ship&#x27;s party.

&quot;Tartar&quot; was recommissioned on 12 January 1967 and attended Portsmouth Navy Days later that year. The frigate arrived in the Persian Gulf in 1968 via Simonstown, Mombasa and the Seychelles.

On 29 March 1968, &quot;Tartar&quot; and the amphibious assault vessel were deployed to patrol off the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, small islands in the Persian Gulf, to deter Iran from occupying the islands. Between 1969 and 1971 she was commanded by Captain Cameron Rusby. On the voyage to the Seychelles the fleet auxiliary vessel was lost, having struck a submerged object. Service in the Gulf was followed by a homeward journey via the Beira Patrol lasting six weeks and Cape Town thence to Gibraltar arriving during the talks between Harold Wilson, Prime Minister and Ian Smith from Rhodesia on board the cruiser .

In 1975, &quot;Tartar&quot; undertook fishery protection duties in the Barents Sea. She supported operations during the Third Cod War with Iceland. During the dispute, &quot;Tartar&quot; was rammed by the patrol vessel on 1 April 1976, and by on 6 May. In total, &quot;Tartar&quot; spent six weeks on fisheries protection patrols in the Third Cod War, and was involved in four collisions. Later that year, in the West Indies, &quot;Tartar&quot; searched for and located the wreckage of Cubana Flight 455. She was present at the Spithead Fleet Review in 1977, held in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. At this time she was part of the 1st Frigate Squadron.

&quot;Tartar&quot; was reduced to reserve in 1980, being placed in the Standby Squadron. She was taken out of reserve during the Falklands War and restored for active service. The frigate did not deploy to the South Atlantic, however, instead operating in home waters in the absence of other warships. She did deploy to the West Indies as a guardship in 1982/1983 for 3 months, spending Christmas and New Year in St Petersburg, Florida. In June 1983, &quot;Tartar&quot;″s Westland Wasp helicopter evacuated the six-man crew of the supply ship , which had collided with an oil rig in the English Channel. As a potential hazard to navigation, &quot;Spearfish&quot; had to be sunk by the guns of &quot;Tartar&quot;.

===Indonesian Navy===
&quot;Tartar&quot; was decommissioned in March 1984 and sold to Indonesia. After a refit at Vosper Thornycroft&#x27;s Woolston, Southampton shipyard, the ship was delivered on 22 January 1986 and was commissioned into the Indonesian Navy on 3 April 1986, with the name KRI &quot;Hasanuddin&quot;, so named after a sultan who fought the Dutch. The frigate was stricken in 2000 and her name was given to a Dutch-built .

<text>A long-range acoustic device (LRAD), acoustic hailing device (AHD) or sound cannon is a specialized loudspeaker that produces sound at high power for communicating at a distance. It has been used as a method of crowd control, which has caused permanent hearing damage, having an extremely high decibel capacity (up to 160 dB measured at one meter from the device). Other uses have included for negotiations in siege situations; to deal with piracy at sea; for mass notification during natural disasters or other emergencies; and by defense forces, including several navies.

== Overview ==

Acoustic hailing devices are acoustic devices capable of outputting intelligible sound at very high volumes. The distance at which acoustic hailing can be effective varies based on several factors including the sound level, directionality, and frequency of the acoustic source, the sensitivity and directionality of the receiver, and the transmission channel environment. The sound level diminishes or attenuates with distance. Consequently, as a general rule, higher source levels have greater range. 
Acoustic hailing devices can come in two forms;
# Directional models: These AHDs are characterized by their ability to create long-range, directional voice communications and warning tones. Their directionality is typically 5° to 60° radius conical at a 2kHz tone.
# Omnidirectional models: These acoustic hailing devices are capable of creating 360° voice communications and warning tones. These devices are capable of being heard over away from the emitter head.

=== Origin ===
The term &quot;acoustic hailing device&quot; came into common use following the suicide attack on the while it was at a port in Yemen in 2000. Following this attack, the United States Navy established a requirement for an acoustic hailing device. The intent of this AHD was to provide the Navy with a means to establish the intent of an approaching vessel at a distance such that defensive measures could be taken should the vessel not heed a warning. One unique aspect of this requirement was that the sound needed to be focused so that it could be clearly directed at the approaching vessel.

=== Present ===
Since their inception in 2002, acoustic hailing devices have grown into a variety of applications. AHD uses include checkpoints, crowd control, maritime shipping, mass notification, early warning systems, critical infrastructure protection, military applications and wildlife protection and control. Acoustic hailing devices are now fielded all over the world by various commercial, law enforcement, and military groups.

==History==
In October 2000 the , an American guided missile destroyer, was bombed in an attack by al-Qaeda operatives, using a small boat packed with explosives. The naval personnel on Cole were unable to be sure that their messages could be heard by the approaching boat at a sufficient distance to possibly avert the attack. The ship was badly damaged, with 17 U.S. Navy sailors killed and 37 injured.

Following this attack, navies around the world made several policy changes, while the American Technology Corporation (which was rebranded to LRAD Corporation in 2010 and to Genasys in late October 2019) created and developed the AHD market, which included the launch of its proprietary Long Range Acoustic Device, a type of acoustic hailing device, in 2003. Using this new technology, it became possible for naval personnel to contact approaching vessels which did not respond to radio calls from a distance of over , enabling them to respond appropriately in a timely manner and avert danger.

Since then the technology has developed and expanded. Genasys launched its voice-based mass notification systems in 2012, and in 2019 its unified multichannel Critical Communications and Enterprise Safety system.

LRAD devices have become widely used for communications, and increasingly for crowd control in a range of settings, including civil disturbances and protests.

== Characteristics and measurements ==
Acoustic hailing devices differ from conventional speaker systems in three key ways: volume, clarity, and directionality. AHD manufacturers use different methods to measure their products, but a common standard has emerged.

=== Volume ===
Since sound attenuates with distance, extremely high outputs are required to achieve the required range. Acoustic hailing devices have an output of 135 decibels (dB) or greater. The acoustic level of the source is commonly expressed in terms of Sound Pressure Level or SPL. SPL is a logarithmic measure of the rms sound pressure of a sound relative to a reference value. It is measured in decibels (dB) above a standard reference level. For reference, at a distance of 1 meter, a normal talking voice is approximately 50 dB and a jet engine at 30 meters is 150 dB.

=== Clarity ===
A principal weakness of common speaker systems and bullhorns is their clarity. Their horns and cones create sound that is distorted or out of phase. This results in the common &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; effect, where the message is muffled and misunderstood, analogous to the muted brass squawks representing the unintelligible voices of adults in animated &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials. AHDs create sound that is in phase. Because of this, sound emitted from acoustic hailing devices is intelligible at distance. Clarity is difficult to measure, since it is a subjective reference. However, different scales have been created to compare devices. A common measurement is the Speech Transmission Index (STI). STI ratings range from 0–1.0, with 1.0 being perfect clarity.

=== Focus ===
AHDs are lastly characterized by directionality. To ensure messages are broadcast to the target, AHDs shape sound into a 30–60° audio beam. This shaping is accomplished through the design of the transducers as well as various reflective horns. 
The focus of an AHD is typically measured at the frequency of peak directionality. This is typically in the 1–2 kHz range. Not all frequencies of sound are able to be directed equally. Lower frequencies in the bass range are difficult to form. As such, their directionality may be a 40 degree radius or more depending on the design of the AHD.
==Specifications and functionality==
LRAD devices are made by Genasys. , the company claims its LRAD products meet the following specifications:
* 30° audible transmission ranges out to 5,000 meters
* 60º–360° audible mass notification coverage over areas up to 

LRAD devices include hand-held devices, as well as those mounted on helicopters, motor vehicles and ships.

The parameter &quot;ka&quot;, which is the wave number multiplied by the speaker radius, is often used to characterize sound source directivity. For this source, ka=19 at 2.5 kHz, and according to the LRAD data sheet, the beam angle of about 30 degrees total is what is predicted for a regular loudspeaker.

Small spherical &quot;point-source&quot; acoustic devices follow the known inverse square law, which predicts the loss of 6 decibels (dB) per doubling of distance from the source, solely due to geometric spreading. Large speakers (or large arrays), such as these, have an interference pattern in the nearfield which produces peaks 6 dB higher than the output pressure and nulls where the pressure is essentially zero. The larger the speaker, and the higher the frequency, the longer the effective nearfield. The nearfield for this device is approximately . An LRAD can thus emit a targeted &quot;beam&quot; of sound at very high volume, up to 160 dB at one meter from the device. This is louder than standing behind a jet engine taking off, or a nearby gunshot.

==Use==
Following the impetus for its initial development, 25 navies have adopted the use of LRADs , to provide protection for their vessels. Navy personnel can contact approaching vessels from over and respond defensively if necessary. They are also used by coast guards, naval bases, commercial vessels, and in ports.

Genasys offers its products for the following categories of use on its U.S. website: defense, law enforcement, fire and rescue services, border security, protection of critical infrastructure, and maritime safety. its products are in use in 100 countries. The Asia-Pacific website is focused on emergency management during natural disasters such as bushfires. It is not categorized as a defense item, and does not require an export license.

The technology can also be used to deter wildlife from airport runways, as at Changi Airport in Singapore, and to protect gas and oil platforms from fishing boats, birds and security threats.

There are two basic ways of using LRAD devices: for voice amplification and as an alert. The technology used in &quot;siren mode&quot; (called an &quot;alert tone&quot; by Genasys), primarily for usage in emergency situations, has also been used for crowd control. In this mode, it allows sound transmission at around 2,000–4,000 Hertz, which causes maximum discomfort for the people targeted, as this is the frequency range at human hearing is most sensitive. Although sometimes referred to as an Active Denial System, the latter is based on a different technology, in which millimetre-wave radiation causes nerve receptors in the skin to feel heat, via dielectric heating.

== Risks ==
Acoustic hailing devices have the potential to be used as non-lethal weapons. The human ear can typically stand a sound pressure level of 120 dB before feeling pain. AHDs are capable of 135 dB or more of acoustic energy. OSHA states that any sound pressure level over 90 dB requires hearing protection. As volume increases so does the chance of hearing loss. The effective non-lethal range of an AHD depends on the total acoustic output of the unit. Typically, this range is or less.

In addition to its &quot;voice&quot; feature, which acts as a loudspeaker, the LRAD has an &quot;alert&quot; feature, which emits loud chirping or beeping sounds, which can be used at the top of the decibel range of the device. These sounds have been reported to cause pain and hearing damage. The use of the alert function for crowd control has been described as a &quot;sound cannon&quot; or sonic weapon, although this has been denied by the manufacturer. The sound can be targeted within a narrow and specific range that does not impact those operating the device or standing next to it. Civil liberties organizations are concerned about its use by police forces, and its use has been contested in law courts in the United States. One concern is that police officers are not receiving enough training in its use.

Law enforcement organizations and the manufacturer claim that LRAD systems are primarily designed for long-range communications; however, the device has an extremely high decibel capacity and has been controversially used as a less-lethal weapon for crowd control. Police usually use models that are not quite as powerful as the military-grade version; however, generating levels ranging from 137 dB to 154 dB, they are capable of causing pain, disorientation, nausea, migraines, and permanent damage.

The NYPD&#x27;s LRAD use was to be challenged in US federal court in 2020. Due to potential risks and a lack of studies on the health impact of sonic weapons, the American Civil Liberties Union recommended in a fact sheet that their use in protests be suspended.

==Deployments and uses by emergency services ==
===Australia===
By mid-2016, most Australian police forces had acquired LRADs (Queensland Police said that they had been using it since 2009), and concerns were raised about their use for crowd control. However, before 2020, there was no use of the LRAD in public situations; most usage had been by the various police forces for communications during natural disasters or for negotiations with hostage-takers in a siege, where it was too dangerous to approach a suspect. In June 2020, during the Black Lives Matter protests in New South Wales, NSW Police used LRADs in a different way for the first time, and it has been used at other anti-racism protests in Australia.

The device came to the attention of the wider public when it was used at the 2022 anti-vaccine mandate Canberra protests in &quot;loud hailer&quot; mode for voice messages to be announced to the protesters, and there was speculation among protesters regarding purported harms from its use. However, there was no evidence that it was used as a siren. In addition, some reports appeared to confuse the LRAD with other crowd control devices, such as the Active Denial System; one activist claimed that &quot;supersonic weapons&quot; had been used.

===Czech Republic===
On June 26, 2015, Czech Special Forces Police may have deployed an LRAD 500X during anti-immigration and anti-Islam protests in Brno, the second largest city in the Czech Republic.

Police in Prague used a vehicle-mounted LRAD on November 17, 2020, to repeatedly alert protesters on Wenceslas Square to follow COVID restrictions and wear masks. On that day, police supervised several rallies, meetings and demonstrations. Thousands of participants gathered at the largest protests in the Old Town Square. The police and a Prague City Hall representative used an LRAD to repeatedly call upon demonstrators to follow COVID public safety protocols and to comply with security measures.

During a November 25, 2021 march from the center of Prague to the local soccer stadium for a Europa Conference League match, Prague police and regional Czech law enforcement officers utilized vehicle mounted LRADs to broadcast frequent warnings against the use of pyrotechnics by the large crowds.

Prague police officers utilized a vehicle-mounted LRAD to issue more than 500 warnings to revelers not to set off pyrotechnics during downtown December 31, 2021 - January 1, 2022 New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations.

A vehicle-mounted LRAD was deployed by police in Prague on March 11, 2023, to communicate to and warn away demonstrators from the National Museum.

=== Germany ===
In the first half of 2020, Bad Homburg&#x27;s fire brigade and city police used an LRAD 100X system more than 60 times to deliver COVID-19 information.

=== Greece ===
Hellenic Police acquired two LRAD systems to be used at the Evros border. These were tested after the March 2020 migrant crisis at the border, triggered by the Turkish government. They are to be used as a deterrent against illegal border entry, as a notification system, as well as to handle aggressive actions against the Hellenic Armed Forces.

===Japan===
Japan&#x27;s Coast Guard used Long Range Acoustic Devices and other methods to expel a North Korean fishing flotilla from its waters in September 2017.

In February 2009, the Japanese whaling fleet operating in Antarctic waters near Australia installed LRADs on their vessels. The device was used against activists of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The Japanese fleet later escalated the use of LRAD, deploying it against a Sea Shepherd helicopter carrying a camera crew. Sea Shepherd noted that they had an LRAD of their own, but as of early 2010, had not put it into use other than to play a recording of &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; in the manner of attacking U.S. Army helicopters depicted in the 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

===New Zealand===
During the dispersion of New Zealand&#x27;s parliament protest in March 2022, LRAD were used by New Zealand police against the protesters. A document released under the Official Information Act (OIA), revealed two long range acoustic devices (LRADs) were deployed at the Parliament protest on March 2. 

===Poland===
LRAD was present, but not used because of current legal regulations during protests in Poland, including Million Marijuana March 2011 and Marsz Niepodległości (National Independence Day March) 2011 and 2012. Lacking a way to utilize the LRADs purchased to their full potential sparked an investigation suspecting corruption behind their acquisition. National Police Headquarters spokesman Mariusz Sokolowski defended the purchase of LRAD. He also stressed that the police decided to make this investment because, &quot;We needed good sound reinforcement equipment. With numerous demonstrations and gatherings, police need a public address system that allows you to reach thousands of people.&quot;

Municipal police in Gdańsk, Poznań, Kołobrzeg and other cities in Poland used LRAD systems to deliver COVID-19 notifications.

===Singapore===
LRAD is used by the Singapore Changi Airport to disperse birds and wildlife from runways.

===Spain===
Local police in Leganés, Spain used a vehicle-mounted LRAD to deliver alerts and notifications to residents during the country-wide COVID-19 lockdown. According to Citizen Security, Communication and local government spokesman, Oscar Oliveira, &quot;Because the acoustic device can be heard inside of houses, we can inform older residents with mobility issues that all municipal resources are available through the Citizen Attention Service by calling 010.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence on May 11, 2012, that an LRAD would be deployed in London during the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. It was spotted fixed to a landing craft on the River Thames.

===United States===
An LRAD was present, but not used, during protests of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. LRAD was present and used when the New York City Police department raided and destroyed the Occupy Wall Street encampment from Zuccotti Park to disrupt and disperse the crowd before arresting or ejecting them on the morning of 15 November 2011. On December 5, 2014, the NYPD utilized an LRAD, notifying approximately 100 protestors to disperse, during the protest of the police killing of Eric Garner in Midtown Manhattan. The NYPD used a Long Range Acoustic Device during the Baltimore solidarity rally in Union Square on April 29, 2015. An NYPD pickup truck equipped with an LRAD parked near protesters and broadcast a looped warning message about staying off the streets and not blocking the sidewalks. Rochester NY police used verbal warnings and an LRAD to help disperse disorderly crowds during the August 2019 Puerto Rican Festival. Rochester, NY police used a Long Range Acoustic Device to make announcements to protesters that they were unlawfully in the roadway and obstructing traffic on September 12, 2020. The device was also used at the September 16, 2020 protest in front of Rochester city hall.

The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department used a LRAD at the January 21, 2017 Women&#x27;s March. Protesters at the June 1, 2020 Washington, D.C. George Floyd protests said police gave little or no warning before employing aggressive tactics against them. A 2015 settlement requires federal police to give large crowds several loud dispersal orders before deploying chemical irritants and other dispersion tools. Using an LRAD to issue loud protest dispersal orders would have complied with the 2015 settlement requirement. In September 2020, it was revealed that federal officials had explored the use of the device and the Active Denial System (&quot;heat ray&quot;) to disperse civilians protesting outside the White House in June of that year, but had been advised that the National Guard was not currently in possession of either device.

LRAD was reportedly used by the Oakland Police Department during the clearance of the Occupy Oakland encampment on the morning of 25 October 2011. Police in San Diego, California, used an LRAD on May 27, 2016, to order anti-Trump protesters to disperse. The Mendocino County (California) Board of Supervisors approved the purchase of a Long Range Acoustic Device for the Mendocino County Sheriff&#x27;s Office on April 18, 2017. Sheriff Tom Allman said the device would aid in searches for missing persons, most often hunters and mushroom pickers, which cost the county tens of thousands of dollars. He said the LRAD might have made the intense 2011 manhunt for Aaron Bassler a little easier, and that it could be used to warn of a tsunami. MCSO found LRAD useful out of a low-flying plane, and it could help in a barricaded-person situation to communicate from the outside of the building.

The Greensboro, North Carolina Police Department (GPD) purchased an LRAD 300X and demonstrated it for reporters in November 2015. Jonathan Franks, a GPD captain, said that it could be used for alerts for everything from riots to missing children to weather disasters, and that it could save lives in some cases. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina Police Department Crisis Intervention Team and SWAT negotiators used a long-range acoustic device to talk a man down from an energized electrical tower.

The Phoenix, Arizona city council approved the purchase of two LRAD 500X systems in November 2018 &quot;to give clear and concise messages to groups of people whenever we find it necessary&quot;. Police utilized a Long Range Acoustic device to declare an unlawful assembly in downtown Phoenix, Arizona, on May 28, 2020, during the George Floyd protests. Multiple announcements were made in English and Spanish.

The Salisbury, Maryland Police Department acquired an LRAD in October 2013 with proceeds from their speed cameras. On February 17, 2017, the Princess Anne Police Department deployed its LRAD system at the request of the Maryland State Police to disperse an unruly concert crowd on the campus of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore.

The Columbus, Ohio Police Department (CPD) demonstrated a Long Range Acoustic Device to the local media on November 21, 2016. CPD expects to use the device for crowd control, barricaded suspect operations, and to communicate to residents during emergencies and natural disasters. The Cuyahoga County Sheriff&#x27;s Department purchased Long Range Acoustic Devices to improve the department&#x27;s ability to issue dispersal orders clearly over long distances. The purchases resulted from the department&#x27;s after-action report of the May 30, 2020 riot in downtown Cleveland, Ohio.

The Seattle Police Department in Washington purchased an LRAD in response to claims that it did not adequately communicate orders to demonstrators during the summer 2020 protests. SPD&#x27;s use of its LRAD was alleged to have caused ear damage to a peaceful demonstrator, although an internal SPD review deemed the allegations to be unsustained. After receiving feedback from protesters who said commands from on-scene officers were not clear or loud enough, the Seattle, Washington mayor&#x27;s office recommended purchasing an LRAD.

LRADs were used by the Pittsburgh PD in Pennsylvania during protests at the G20 Summit in September 2009. This was the first time the LRAD was used during a protest in the U.S.

LRAD was deployed during a march against NATO&#x27;s actions and policies in Chicago, Illinois on May 20, 2012, at Michigan Ave. &amp; Cermack.

St. Louis County police used LRAD during protests surrounding the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina police obtained two LRAD systems through a federal grant in March 2015. Myrtle Beach police captain Marty Brown told the Myrtle Beach city council that &quot;his department is getting the LRADs to enhance their communication capabilities be it with large crowds or for emergency announcements such as evacuation orders.&quot;

The New Jersey State Police used an armored-vehicle-mounted LRAD to communicate with crowds denied entry to a June 7, 2015 concert after they began throwing bottles and tried to rush the gates outside MetLife Stadium.

Police from several agencies, including North Dakota state troopers, the National Guard, and other law enforcement agencies from surrounding counties and states deployed two LRADs to clear a protest camp and blockades along Highway 1806. &quot;Long Range Acoustic Devices, which emit an ear-splitting whine, were used intermittently throughout the day&quot; one reporter wrote. An LRAD was present again on November 20, 2016, at the bridge just north of the protesters camp on highway 1806.

During the same period, the LRAD was used at a protest in front of the Arkansas State Capitol.

The Portland Police Bureau in Oregon used a vehicle-mounted LRAD during the protests there following the murder of George Floyd on June 4, 2020, and on other occasions during the protests.

A BearCat-mounted LRAD was used to emit voice messages and high-pitched sirens in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 24, 2020, in front of the Kenosha County Courthouse to disperse crowds assembled in Civic Center Park as part of the Jacob Blake protests.

On March 6, 2021, the Boulder Police Department used a toned warble noise from an LRAD in an effort to disperse a crowd of up to 800 students from the University of Colorado Boulder. The University Hill Incident occurred when code enforcement and members of Boulder Police&#x27;s Neighborhood Impact Team were unable to disperse partygoers who were congregating against Boulders public health order. LRAD was used after students and other partygoers began throwing rocks at SWAT vehicles and officers.

On April 12, 2021, the Brooklyn Center, Minnesota Police Department deployed a vehicle mounted LRAD outside of its headquarters to announce curfew violations and dispersal orders to a large crowd protesting the death of Daunte Wright.

On July 3, 2021, Massachusetts State Police utilized an LRAD to secure a group of 11 suspects involved in the Sovereign Citizen movement. The group identified themselves as part of the &quot;Rise of the Moors&quot; movement, or &quot;Moorish Americans&quot;. The self styled militia group was traveling between Rhode Island and Maine when an MSP trooper came across their convoy refueling. The group had multiple firearms in their possession, and admitted to not having proper carrying requirements. Several fled into the surrounding forest, at which point the LRAD was deployed. The group was taken into custody without further incident.

The Oklahoma County, Oklahoma Sheriff&#x27;s Office Tactical Team used a vehicle-mounted LRAD on November 22, 2021, to serve a search warrant on a residence suspected of being used for drug trafficking.

==Mass notification==
===Australia===
Genasys has supplied its NEWS mass notification service in Australia since 2013, when it partnered with Nokia to deliver emergency notifications via SMS, following the disastrous consequences of the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009.

===United States===
Menlo Park and Atherton, California police and fire officials attended a &#x27;sound off&#x27; between a siren installation and an LRAD 360XT mobile voice mass notification system in April 2018. &quot;The side by side test was very helpful and everyone agreed that the LRAD system completely outperformed the older siren system,&quot; said Fire District Emergency Manager Ryan Zollicoffer. &quot;Not only because of the voice capability, but the modular-mobility benefit is something that appeals to first responders because it can be used for a variety of public safety purposes and better moved around if that&#x27;s needed or desired.&quot;

The Menlo Park Fire District demonstrated its Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) community notification system on April 18, 2019. The fire district also showed how the ShakeAlert system could eventually be tied together with its LRAD to provide area wide audible alerts for earthquake, flood, fire and other emergencies. &quot;ShakeAlert will notify and protect our Station firefighters, but we also believe coupled with the LRAD public address system, it can help to bridge the &#x27;notification gap&#x27; as another important public safety tool and option for community early warning messaging for earthquakes as well as for fire and flooding information and evacuation signaling,&quot; said Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman.

The City of Laguna Beach, California, installed LRAD speaker sirens in 2018. The systems alert the downtown and Main Beach areas during an emergency where the public needs to take immediate action.

In June 2019, Mill Valley, California, became the first city in the Bay Area to replace its sirens with LRAD community notification systems. The combined siren loudspeakers receive emergency messages via satellite and have backup batteries if the power fails.

The Mill Valley Fire Department began testing its city&#x27;s new LRAD installations on June 27, 2019. LRAD systems project both siren and voice recordings to alert and inform community members during large-scale disasters. The Long Range Acoustic Devices replaced siren-only systems in five Mill Valley, California locations. &quot;We believe that the purchase and installation of LRAD goes a long way to improve the resiliency and redundancy of our communication systems,&quot; Mill Valley Fire Chief Tom Welch said. &quot;LRAD systems are highly effective in communicating warnings, instructions, and notifications throughout incident sites and over vast areas during life-threatening events.&quot;

The City of Newport Beach plans to spend $200,000 to replace three rusty tsunami warning sirens on the Balboa Peninsula with LRAD siren/public address systems. The LRAD systems are expected to be installed by the end of 2019.

In October 2020, Laguna Beach, California, tested its expanded outdoor warning system of 13 Long Range Acoustic Devices mounted on buildings throughout the city. The solar-powered devices broadcast recorded evacuation messages in case cell service is disabled during a disaster.

Seven new LRAD emergency siren systems are scheduled for installation in southern Marin County in 2022.

The Berkeley, California city council approved the installation of a Genasys outdoor warning system to alert residents of fires, earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters. The system is capable of running on solar-powered battery backup and being controlled remotely via satellite.

Public safety officials in Berkeley, California unveiled the city&#x27;s new Genasys emergency warning network during the September 17, 2023 Fire Ready Fest. Ten systems that broadcast both sirens and voice messages have been installed on buildings throughout Berkeley to provide another layer of reaching residents and visitors in the event of serious emergencies. Five more systems are projected to be installed by early 2024.

==High seas anti-piracy==

On November 5, 2005, the luxury cruise ship &quot;Seabourn Spirit&quot; employed an LRAD to repel pirates who attacked the vessel with rocket-propelled grenades about off the coast of Somalia. The effectiveness of this device during the attack is not completely clear, but the pirates did not succeed in boarding the vessel and eventually fled.

The Liberian-flagged vessel was attacked on November 28, 2008. The security detachment aboard &quot;Biscaglia&quot; was reported to have used an LRAD device in an effort to repel attackers armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Following a one-sided shootout, the ship was seized and the unarmed security contractors abandoned ship leaving the ship and crew to the pirates. The incident caused the usefulness of LRADs to be called into question by &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot;. The security detachment&#x27;s reported use of LRAD is not completely clear as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; makes no mention of LRAD being used during the incident. 

In January 2011, the &quot;Spirit of Adventure&quot;, a cruise ship sailing through the Indian Ocean, deployed an LRAD system as part of its defensive measures when being pursued by pirates.

S/Y Hideaway used an LRAD in 2016 to deter suspected pirates in the Gulf of Aden.

<text>Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet () is a Catholic church in the centre of Paris, France, in the 5th arrondissement. It was constructed between 1656 and 1763. The facade was designed in the classical style by Charles Le Brun. It contains many notable art works from the 19th century, including a rare religious painting by Jean-Baptiste Corot.

Since the expulsion of the parish priest and his assistants by traditionalist Catholics in 1977, the church has been run by the Society of St. Pius X, which celebrates Traditional Latin Masses there.

==History==

===Establishment ===

A chapel was first built in 1230, in a field planted with chardons (thistles), hence the name. It originally was a dependence of the Abbey of Saint Victor. As the population of the neighbourhood grew, a series of larger churches were built. In 1656, the construction of the present church began, under architects Michel Noblet and François Levé. Due to a shortage of funds, the church was not finished until 1763. Only the bell tower, built sometime before 1600, remains from the earlier church.

In the late 17th century, noted harpsichordist Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy (1633–1694) served as titular organist of the church.

The church was closed and badly damaged during the French Revolution, and most of the art was destroyed. It was gradually replaced with new work by French artists in the 19th century.

Since 1905, the city of Paris, following the enactment of the law on separation of Church and State, claims ownership of the church but grants the Roman Catholic Church a free usage right.

===1977 occupation and rededication ===
On 27 February 1977, traditionalist priest Monsignor François Ducaud-Bourget, who opposed the post-Vatican II Mass, organised a meeting of his followers at the nearby Maison de la Mutualité. He led the attendees to Saint-Nicolas church, where a service was just concluding. Ducaud-Bourget entered in procession, went to the altar and said Mass in Latin. The parish priest was ejected. The occupation was intended to be just for the length of the Mass, but then it continued indefinitely. The parish priest went to court and obtained an order for the expulsion of the occupiers, but the application order was delayed pending mediation, with writer Jean Guitton appointed as mediator. After three months of mediation between the occupants and the Archbishop of Paris, François Marty, Guitton admitted his failure to resolve the issue; the police made no attempt to enforce the expulsion order. The occupiers aligned themselves with the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), and received help from its leader, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.

In 1978, the Court of Cassation confirmed that the occupation was illegal but the order of eviction was never implemented. On 20 February 1987, the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; ruled that the disturbance to public order resulting from an expulsion would be higher than that resulting from the illegal occupation.

Ducaud-Bourget died in 1984, and was replaced by Philippe Laguérie. In 1993, the SSPX members, led by Laguérie, unsuccessfully attempted to occupy another church in Paris, St-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the congregation of Saint-Nicolas defied the social distancing regulations then in force by holding an Easter Vigil. A live stream on YouTube showed the priest and deacons in close contact, without wearing masks, and Holy Communion was given with bare hands. About 40 people were in attendance. The priest was warned and booked, and given a €135 fine.

== Exterior ==

The construction of the primary facade of the church on Rue Monge, designed by architect Charles Halley, was long unfinished, and was not completed until 1937. It follows the classical style of the rest of the building. The side doorway along the rue des Bernardins, designed by Charles Le Brun, dates to 1669, and is a particularly good example of the classicism of the period. It features pilasters in the Ionic and composite style, triangular frontons or pediments, and sculpted angels. The door, designed by Nicolas Legendre, is richly decorated with carved wreaths and heads of cherubs.
== Interior ==

The interior of the church is a good example of the Baroque style, lavishly decorated with paintings, medallions and sculpture, dedicated to visually expressing the glory of God. The nave is lined with rows of cruciform pillars, and pilasters with capitals decorated with acanthus leaves in the classical style The arcades that separate the outer aisles from the nave have rounded arches, also in the classical Roman style.

The arrangement of the interior was modified to suit pre-Vatican II liturgical arrangements after 1977 when the church was occupied by the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X. In the pre-Vatican II Tridentine Mass, the priest always celebrates Mass facing east, rather than the congregation, and thus the freestanding &quot;Novus Ordo&quot; altar was removed.

== Art and Decoration - the Chapels ==
===Chapels of Lower Right Aisle - Le Brun and Corot ===

The chapel in the first traverse displays an early work by Charles Le Brun, called &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint John the Evangelist at the Latin Gate.&quot; Le Brun was a student of Simon Vouet, who later became the court painter of Louis XIV. It depicts Saint John, who has been sentenced by the Emperor Diocletian to be thrown into a vat of boiling oil, from which his body emerges unscathed. The painting displays his early skill depicting the human form and the sense of movement.

The Chapel of the Baptismal Fonts displays a rare religious painting by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot;. The Baptism itself occupies only the lower third of the painting, and follows the classical style of Nicolas Poussin. The upper two-thirds are occupied by an angel flying above a majestic tree and landscape, the subjects for which Corot became famous. Eugène Delacroix saw the painting in Corot&#x27;s studio, and described it in his journal as &quot;His grand baptism of Christ, full of naive beauties.&quot;

===Sculpture in the chapels===

The central feature of the Chapel of Saint-Charles-Boromée is the funeral monument of Charles Le Brun and his wife, Suzanne Butay, made by the sculptor Antoine Coysevox (1640-1720). In the same chapel, the sculptor Jean Collignon (died 1702) created the tomb of Juilienne Le Be, the mother of Le Brun, following a drawing by Le Brun. The composition of the sculpture follows a theme typical of the French Baroque style at the beginning of the 18th century. The deceased is depicted emerging from her tomb, praying, with her eyes upward. Above her is a sculpture of an angel with a trumpet, announcing the Judgement Day and her resurrection.

<doc id="620665" wikidata="Q3071757" url="?curid=620665" title="Oakum">
<text>Oakum is a preparation of tarred fibers used to seal gaps. Its traditional application was in shipbuilding for caulking or packing the joints of timbers in wooden vessels and the deck planking of iron and steel ships. Oakum was also used in plumbing for sealing joints in cast iron pipe, and in log cabins for chinking. In shipbuilding it was forced into the seams using a hammer and a caulking iron, then sealed into place with hot pitch.

It is also referenced frequently as a medical supply for medieval surgeons, often used alongside bandages for sealing wounds.

==History==
The word oakum derives from Middle English &#x27;, from Old English &#x27;, from &#x27; (separative and perfective prefix) + &#x27; (akin to Old English &quot;&quot;, &quot;comb&quot;)—literally &quot;off-combings&quot;.

Oakum was at one time recycled from old tarry ropes and cordage, which were painstakingly unravelled and reduced to fibre, termed &quot;picking&quot;. The task of picking and preparation was a common occupation in prisons and workhouses, where the young or the old and infirm were put to work picking oakum if they were unsuited for heavier labour. Sailors undergoing naval punishment were also frequently sentenced to pick oakum, with each man made to pick of oakum a day. 

The work was tedious, slow and taxing on the worker&#x27;s thumbs and fingers. In 1862, girls under 16 at Tothill Fields Bridewell had to pick a day, and boys under 16 had to pick . Over the age of 16, girls and boys had to pick per day respectively. The oakum was sold for £4 10s () per hundredweight (). At Coldbath Fields Prison, the men&#x27;s counterpart to Tothill Fields, prisoners had to pick per day unless sentenced to hard labour, in which case they had to pick between of oakum per day.

In modern times, the fibrous material used in oakum comes from virgin hemp or jute. In plumbing and marine applications, the fibers are impregnated with tar or a tar-like substance, traditionally pine tar (also called &quot;Stockholm tar&quot;), an amber-coloured pitch made from pine sap. Tar-like petroleum by-products can also be used for modern oakum. &quot;White oakum&quot; is made from untarred material, and was chiefly used as packing between brick and masonry in homes and building construction prior to World War II, as its breathability allows moisture to continue to wick and transfer through the material.

==Plumbing==
Oakum can be used to seal cast iron pipe drains. After setting the pipes together, workers pack oakum into the joints, then pour molten lead into the joint to create a permanent &quot;lead and oakum&quot; seal. The oakum swells and seals the joint, the tar in the oakum prevents rot, and the lead keeps the joint physically tight. Oakum present in older cast iron bell/spigot joints may also contain asbestos, requiring special methods for removal.

Today, modern methods, such as rubber seals (for example, gaskets or o-rings), are more common.

==Cultural references==
In Herman Melville&#x27;s novella &quot;Benito Cereno&quot;, crew members of a slave ship spend their idle hours picking oakum.

Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; mentions the extraction of oakum by orphaned children in the workhouse. The oakum extracted is for use on navy ships, and the instructor says that the children are serving the country.

&quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;, a travel book by Mark Twain, also mentions in chapter 37 a &quot;Baker&#x27;s Boy/Famine Breeder&quot; who eats soap and oakum, but prefers oakum, which makes his breath foul and teeth stuck up with tar.

Jack London, in his book &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot; (1903), mentions picking oakum in the workhouses of London.

Robert Jordan, in &quot;Winter&#x27;s Heart&quot; alludes to picking oakum as a punishment among the Sea Folk.

Joshua Slocum in &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, describes caulking his ship the &quot;Spray&quot;, with oakum.

Guy de Chauliac in &quot;The Major Surgery of Guy de Chauliac&quot;, frequently cites oakum as a medical supply in his treatments of wounds.

Bernard Cornwell, in his Sharpe novels, refers to Richard Sharpe&#x27;s childhood in a workhouse, picking fibres from old rope.

<doc id="620667" wikidata="Q185698" url="?curid=620667" title="Methodology">
<text>In its most common sense, methodology is the study of research methods. However, the term can also refer to the methods themselves or to the philosophical discussion of associated background assumptions. A method is a structured procedure for bringing about a certain goal, like acquiring knowledge or verifying knowledge claims. This normally involves various steps, like choosing a sample, collecting data from this sample, and interpreting the data. The study of methods concerns a detailed description and analysis of these processes. It includes evaluative aspects by comparing different methods. This way, it is assessed what advantages and disadvantages they have and for what research goals they may be used. These descriptions and evaluations depend on philosophical background assumptions. Examples are how to conceptualize the studied phenomena and what constitutes evidence for or against them. When understood in the widest sense, methodology also includes the discussion of these more abstract issues.

Methodologies are traditionally divided into quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research is the main methodology of the natural sciences. It uses precise numerical measurements. Its goal is usually to find universal laws used to make predictions about future events. The dominant methodology in the natural sciences is called the scientific method. It includes steps like observation and the formulation of a hypothesis. Further steps are to test the hypothesis using an experiment, to compare the measurements to the expected results, and to publish the findings.

Qualitative research is more characteristic of the social sciences and gives less prominence to exact numerical measurements. It aims more at an in-depth understanding of the meaning of the studied phenomena and less at universal and predictive laws. Common methods found in the social sciences are surveys, interviews, focus groups, and the nominal group technique. They differ from each other concerning their sample size, the types of questions asked, and the general setting. In recent decades, many social scientists have started using mixed-methods research, which combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

Many discussions in methodology concern the question of whether the quantitative approach is superior, especially whether it is adequate when applied to the social domain. A few theorists reject methodology as a discipline in general. For example, some argue that it is useless since methods should be used rather than studied. Others hold that it is harmful because it restricts the freedom and creativity of researchers. Methodologists often respond to these objections by claiming that a good methodology helps researchers arrive at reliable theories in an efficient way. The choice of method often matters since the same factual material can lead to different conclusions depending on one&#x27;s method. Interest in methodology has risen in the 20th century due to the increased importance of interdisciplinary work and the obstacles hindering efficient cooperation.

== Definitions ==
The term &quot;methodology&quot; is associated with a variety of meanings. In its most common usage, it refers either to a method, to the field of inquiry studying methods, or to philosophical discussions of background assumptions involved in these processes. Some researchers distinguish methods from methodologies by holding that methods are modes of data collection while methodologies are more general research strategies that determine how to conduct a research project. In this sense, methodologies include various theoretical commitments about the intended outcomes of the investigation.

=== As method ===
The term &quot;methodology&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for the term &quot;method&quot;. A method is a way of reaching some predefined goal. It is a planned and structured procedure for solving a theoretical or practical problem. In this regard, methods stand in contrast to free and unstructured approaches to problem-solving. For example, descriptive statistics is a method of data analysis, radiocarbon dating is a method of determining the age of organic objects, sautéing is a method of cooking, and project-based learning is an educational method. The term &quot;technique&quot; is often used as a synonym both in the academic and the everyday discourse. Methods usually involve a clearly defined series of decisions and actions to be used under certain circumstances, usually expressable as a sequence of repeatable instructions. The goal of following the steps of a method is to bring about the result promised by it. In the context of inquiry, methods may be defined as systems of rules and procedures to discover regularities of nature, society, and thought. In this sense, methodology can refer to procedures used to arrive at new knowledge or to techniques of verifying and falsifying pre-existing knowledge claims. This encompasses various issues pertaining both to the collection of data and their analysis. Concerning the collection, it involves the problem of sampling and of how to go about the data collection itself, like surveys, interviews, or observation. There are also numerous methods of how the collected data can be analyzed using statistics or other ways of interpreting it to extract interesting conclusions.

=== As study of methods ===
However, many theorists emphasize the differences between the terms &quot;method&quot; and &quot;methodology&quot;. In this regard, methodology may be defined as &quot;the study or description of methods&quot; or as &quot;the analysis of the principles of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline&quot;. This study or analysis involves uncovering assumptions and practices associated with the different methods and a detailed description of research designs and hypothesis testing. It also includes evaluative aspects: forms of data collection, measurement strategies, and ways to analyze data are compared and their advantages and disadvantages relative to different research goals and situations are assessed. In this regard, methodology provides the skills, knowledge, and practical guidance needed to conduct scientific research in an efficient manner. It acts as a guideline for various decisions researchers need to take in the scientific process.

Methodology can be understood as the middle ground between concrete particular methods and the abstract and general issues discussed by the philosophy of science. In this regard, methodology comes after formulating a research question and helps the researchers decide what methods to use in the process. For example, methodology should assist the researcher in deciding why one method of sampling is preferable to another in a particular case or which form of data analysis is likely to bring the best results. Methodology achieves this by explaining, evaluating and justifying methods. Just as there are different methods, there are also different methodologies. Different methodologies provide different approaches to how methods are evaluated and explained and may thus make different suggestions on what method to use in a particular case.

According to Aleksandr Georgievich Spirkin, &quot;[a] methodology is a system of principles and general ways of organising and structuring theoretical and practical activity, and also the theory of this system&quot;. Helen Kara defines methodology as &quot;a contextual framework for research, a coherent and logical scheme based on views, beliefs, and values, that guides the choices researchers make&quot;. Ginny E. Garcia and Dudley L. Poston understand methodology either as a complex body of rules and postulates guiding research or as the analysis of such rules and procedures. As a body of rules and postulates, a methodology defines the subject of analysis as well as the conceptual tools used by the analysis and the limits of the analysis. Research projects are usually governed by a structured procedure known as the research process. The goal of this process is given by a research question, which determines what kind of information one intends to acquire.

=== As discussion of background assumptions ===
Some theorists prefer an even wider understanding of methodology that involves not just the description, comparison, and evaluation of methods but includes additionally more general philosophical issues. One reason for this wider approach is that discussions of when to use which method often take various background assumptions for granted, for example, concerning the goal and nature of research. These assumptions can at times play an important role concerning which method to choose and how to follow it. For example, Thomas Kuhn argues in his &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; that sciences operate within a framework or a paradigm that determines which questions are asked and what counts as good science. This concerns philosophical disagreements both about how to conceptualize the phenomena studied, what constitutes evidence for and against them, and what the general goal of researching them is. So in this wider sense, methodology overlaps with philosophy by making these assumptions explicit and presenting arguments for and against them. According to C. S. Herrman, a good methodology clarifies the structure of the data to be analyzed and helps the researchers see the phenomena in a new light. In this regard, a methodology is similar to a paradigm. A similar view is defended by Spirkin, who holds that a central aspect of every methodology is the world view that comes with it.

The discussion of background assumptions can include metaphysical and ontological issues in cases where they have important implications for the proper research methodology. For example, a realist perspective considering the observed phenomena as an external and independent reality is often associated with an emphasis on empirical data collection and a more distanced and objective attitude. Idealists, on the other hand, hold that external reality is not fully independent of the mind and tend, therefore, to include more subjective tendencies in the research process as well.

For the quantitative approach, philosophical debates in methodology include the distinction between the inductive and the hypothetico-deductive interpretation of the scientific method. For qualitative research, many basic assumptions are tied to philosophical positions such as hermeneutics, pragmatism, Marxism, critical theory, and postmodernism. According to Kuhn, an important factor in such debates is that the different paradigms are incommensurable. This means that there is no overarching framework to assess the conflicting theoretical and methodological assumptions. This critique puts into question various presumptions of the quantitative approach associated with scientific progress based on the steady accumulation of data.

Other discussions of abstract theoretical issues in the philosophy of science are also sometimes included. This can involve questions like how and whether scientific research differs from fictional writing as well as whether research studies objective facts rather than constructing the phenomena it claims to study. In the latter sense, some methodologists have even claimed that the goal of science is less to represent a pre-existing reality and more to bring about some kind of social change in favor of repressed groups in society.

Viknesh Andiappan and Yoke Kin Wan use the field of process systems engineering to distinguish the term &quot;methodology&quot; from the closely related terms &quot;approach&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, &quot;procedure&quot;, and &quot;technique&quot;. On their view, &quot;approach&quot; is the most general term. It can be defined as &quot;a way or direction used to address a problem based on a set of assumptions&quot;. An example is the difference between hierarchical approaches, which consider one task at a time in a hierarchical manner, and concurrent approaches, which consider them all simultaneously. Methodologies are a little more specific. They are general strategies needed to realize an approach and may be understood as guidelines for how to make choices. Often the term &quot;framework&quot; is used as a synonym. A method is a still more specific way of practically implementing the approach. Methodologies provide the guidelines that help researchers decide which method to follow. The method itself may be understood as a sequence of techniques. A technique is a step taken that can be observed and measured. Each technique has some immediate result. The whole sequence of steps is termed a &quot;procedure&quot;. A similar but less complex characterization is sometimes found in the field of language teaching, where the teaching process may be described through a three-level conceptualization based on &quot;approach&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, and &quot;technique&quot;.

One question concerning the definition of methodology is whether it should be understood as a descriptive or a normative discipline. The key difference in this regard is whether methodology just provides a value-neutral description of methods or what scientists actually do. Many methodologists practice their craft in a normative sense, meaning that they express clear opinions about the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. In this regard, methodology is not just about what researchers &quot;actually do&quot; but about what they &quot;ought to do&quot; or how to perform &quot;good&quot; research.

== Types ==
Theorists often distinguish various general types or approaches to methodology. The most influential classification contrasts quantitative and qualitative methodology.

=== Quantitative and qualitative ===
Quantitative research is closely associated with the natural sciences. It is based on precise numerical measurements, which are then used to arrive at exact general laws. This precision is also reflected in the goal of making predictions that can later be verified by other researchers. Examples of quantitative research include physicists at the Large Hadron Collider measuring the mass of newly created particles and positive psychologists conducting an online survey to determine the correlation between income and self-assessed well-being.

Qualitative research is characterized in various ways in the academic literature but there are very few precise definitions of the term. It is often used in contrast to quantitative research for forms of study that do not quantify their subject matter numerically. However, the distinction between these two types is not always obvious and various theorists have argued that it should be understood as a continuum and not as a dichotomy. A lot of qualitative research is concerned with some form of human experience or behavior, in which case it tends to focus on a few individuals and their in-depth understanding of the meaning of the studied phenomena. Examples of the qualitative method are a market researcher conducting a focus group in order to learn how people react to a new product or a medical researcher performing an unstructured in-depth interview with a participant from a new experimental therapy to assess its potential benefits and drawbacks. It is also used to improve quantitative research, such as informing data collection materials and questionnaire design. Qualitative research is frequently employed in fields where the pre-existing knowledge is inadequate. This way, it is possible to get a first impression of the field and potential theories, thus paving the way for investigating the issue in further studies.

Quantitative methods dominate in the natural sciences but both methodologies are used in the social sciences. Some social scientists focus mostly on one method while others try to investigate the same phenomenon using a variety of different methods. It is central to both approaches how the group of individuals used for the data collection is selected. This process is known as sampling. It involves the selection of a subset of individuals or phenomena to be measured. Important in this regard is that the selected samples are representative of the whole population, i.e. that no significant biases were involved when choosing. If this is not the case, the data collected does not reflect what the population as a whole is like. This affects generalizations and predictions drawn from the biased data. The number of individuals selected is called the &quot;sample size&quot;. For qualitative research, the sample size is usually rather small, while quantitative research tends to focus on big groups and collecting a lot of data. After the collection, the data needs to be analyzed and interpreted to arrive at interesting conclusions that pertain directly to the research question. This way, the wealth of information obtained is summarized and thus made more accessible to others. Especially in the case of quantitative research, this often involves the application of some form of statistics to make sense of the numerous individual measurements.

Many discussions in the history of methodology center around the quantitative methods used by the natural sciences. A central question in this regard is to what extent they can be applied to other fields, like the social sciences and history. The success of the natural sciences was often seen as an indication of the superiority of the quantitative methodology and used as an argument to apply this approach to other fields as well. However, this outlook has been put into question in the more recent methodological discourse. In this regard, it is often argued that the paradigm of the natural sciences is a one-sided development of reason, which is not equally well suited to all areas of inquiry. The divide between quantitative and qualitative methods in the social sciences is one consequence of this criticism.

Which method is more appropriate often depends on the goal of the research. For example, quantitative methods usually excel for evaluating preconceived hypotheses that can be clearly formulated and measured. Qualitative methods, on the other hand, can be used to study complex individual issues, often with the goal of formulating new hypotheses. This is especially relevant when the existing knowledge of the subject is inadequate. Important advantages of quantitative methods include precision and reliability. However, they have often difficulties in studying very complex phenomena that are commonly of interest to the social sciences. Additional problems can arise when the data is misinterpreted to defend conclusions that are not directly supported by the measurements themselves. In recent decades, many researchers in the social sciences have started combining both methodologies. This is known as mixed-methods research. A central motivation for this is that the two approaches can complement each other in various ways: some issues are ignored or too difficult to study with one methodology and are better approached with the other. In other cases, both approaches are applied to the same issue to produce more comprehensive and well-rounded results.

Qualitative and quantitative research are often associated with different research paradigms and background assumptions. Qualitative researchers often use an interpretive or critical approach while quantitative researchers tend to prefer a positivistic approach. Important disagreements between these approaches concern the role of objectivity and hard empirical data as well as the research goal of predictive success rather than in-depth understanding or social change.

=== Others ===
Various other classifications have been proposed. One distinguishes between substantive and formal methodologies. Substantive methodologies tend to focus on one specific area of inquiry. The findings are initially restricted to this specific field but may be transferrable to other areas of inquiry. Formal methodologies, on the other hand, are based on a variety of studies and try to arrive at more general principles applying to different fields. They may also give particular prominence to the analysis of the language of science and the formal structure of scientific explanation. A closely related classification distinguishes between philosophical, general scientific, and special scientific methods.

One type of methodological outlook is called &quot;proceduralism&quot;. According to it, the goal of methodology is to boil down the research process to a simple set of rules or a recipe that automatically leads to good research if followed precisely. However, it has been argued that, while this ideal may be acceptable for some forms of quantitative research, it fails for qualitative research. One argument for this position is based on the claim that research is not a technique but a craft that cannot be achieved by blindly following a method. In this regard, research depends on forms of creativity and improvisation to amount to good science.

Other types include inductive, deductive, and transcendental methods. Inductive methods are common in the empirical sciences and proceed through inductive reasoning from many particular observations to arrive at general conclusions, often in the form of universal laws. Deductive methods, also referred to as axiomatic methods, are often found in formal sciences, such as geometry. They start from a set of self-evident axioms or first principles and use deduction to infer interesting conclusions from these axioms. Transcendental methods are common in Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy. They start with certain particular observations. It is then argued that the observed phenomena can only exist if their conditions of possibility are fulfilled. This way, the researcher may draw general psychological or metaphysical conclusions based on the claim that the phenomenon would not be observable otherwise.

== Importance ==
It has been argued that a proper understanding of methodology is important for various issues in the field of research. They include both the problem of conducting efficient and reliable research as well as being able to validate knowledge claims by others. Method is often seen as one of the main factors of scientific progress. This is especially true for the natural sciences where the developments of experimental methods in the 16th and 17th century are often seen as the driving force behind the success and prominence of the natural sciences. In some cases, the choice of methodology may have a severe impact on a research project. The reason is that very different and sometimes even opposite conclusions may follow from the same factual material based on the chosen methodology.

Aleksandr Georgievich Spirkin argues that methodology, when understood in a wide sense, is of great importance since the world presents us with innumerable entities and relations between them. Methods are needed to simplify this complexity and find a way of mastering it. On the theoretical side, this concerns ways of forming true beliefs and solving problems. On the practical side, this concerns skills of influencing nature and dealing with each other. These different methods are usually passed down from one generation to the next. Spirkin holds that the interest in methodology on a more abstract level arose in attempts to formalize these techniques to improve them as well as to make it easier to use them and pass them on. In the field of research, for example, the goal of this process is to find reliable means to acquire knowledge in contrast to mere opinions acquired by unreliable means. In this regard, &quot;methodology is a way of obtaining and building up ... knowledge&quot;.

Various theorists have observed that the interest in methodology has risen significantly in the 20th century. This increased interest is reflected not just in academic publications on the subject but also in the institutionalized establishment of training programs focusing specifically on methodology. This phenomenon can be interpreted in different ways. Some see it as a positive indication of the topic&#x27;s theoretical and practical importance. Others interpret this interest in methodology as an excessive preoccupation that draws time and energy away from doing research on concrete subjects by applying the methods instead of researching them. This ambiguous attitude towards methodology is sometimes even exemplified in the same person. Max Weber, for example, criticized the focus on methodology during his time while making significant contributions to it himself. Spirkin believes that one important reason for this development is that contemporary society faces many global problems. These problems cannot be solved by a single researcher or a single discipline but are in need of collaborative efforts from many fields. Such interdisciplinary undertakings profit a lot from methodological advances, both concerning the ability to understand the methods of the respective fields and in relation to developing more homogeneous methods equally used by all of them.

== Criticism ==
Most criticism of methodology is directed at one specific form or understanding of it. In such cases, one particular methodological theory is rejected but not methodology at large when understood as a field of research comprising many different theories. In this regard, many objections to methodology focus on the quantitative approach, specifically when it is treated as the only viable approach. Nonetheless, there are also more fundamental criticisms of methodology in general. They are often based on the idea that there is little value to abstract discussions of methods and the reasons cited for and against them. In this regard, it may be argued that what matters is the correct employment of methods and not their meticulous study. Sigmund Freud, for example, compared methodologists to &quot;people who clean their glasses so thoroughly that they never have time to look through them&quot;. According to C. Wright Mills, the practice of methodology often degenerates into a &quot;fetishism of method and technique&quot;.

Some even hold that methodological reflection is not just a waste of time but actually has negative side effects. Such an argument may be defended by analogy to other skills that work best when the agent focuses only on employing them. In this regard, reflection may interfere with the process and lead to avoidable mistakes. According to an example by Gilbert Ryle, &quot;[w]e run, as a rule, worse, not better, if we think a lot about our feet&quot;. A less severe version of this criticism does not reject methodology per se but denies its importance and rejects an intense focus on it. In this regard, methodology has still a limited and subordinate utility but becomes a diversion or even counterproductive by hindering practice when given too much emphasis.

Another line of criticism concerns more the general and abstract nature of methodology. It states that the discussion of methods is only useful in concrete and particular cases but not concerning abstract guidelines governing many or all cases. Some anti-methodologists reject methodology based on the claim that researchers need freedom to do their work effectively. But this freedom may be constrained and stifled by &quot;inflexible and inappropriate guidelines&quot;. For example, according to Kerry Chamberlain, a good interpretation needs creativity to be provocative and insightful, which is prohibited by a strictly codified approach. Chamberlain uses the neologism &quot;methodolatry&quot; to refer to this alleged overemphasis on methodology. Similar arguments are given in Paul Feyerabend&#x27;s book &quot;Against Method&quot;.

However, these criticisms of methodology in general are not always accepted. Many methodologists defend their craft by pointing out how the efficiency and reliability of research can be improved through a proper understanding of methodology.

A criticism of more specific forms of methodology is found in the works of the sociologist Howard S. Becker. He is quite critical of methodologists based on the claim that they usually act as advocates of one particular method usually associated with quantitative research. An often-cited quotation in this regard is that &quot;[m]ethodology is too important to be left to methodologists&quot;. Alan Bryman has rejected this negative outlook on methodology. He holds that Becker&#x27;s criticism can be avoided by understanding methodology as an inclusive inquiry into all kinds of methods and not as a mere doctrine for converting non-believers to one&#x27;s preferred method.

== In different fields ==
Part of the importance of methodology is reflected in the number of fields to which it is relevant. They include the natural sciences and the social sciences as well as philosophy and mathematics.

=== Natural sciences ===

The dominant methodology in the natural sciences (like astronomy, biology, chemistry, geoscience, and physics) is called the scientific method. Its main cognitive aim is usually seen as the creation of knowledge, but various closely related aims have also been proposed, like understanding, explanation, or predictive success. Strictly speaking, there is no one single scientific method. In this regard, the expression &quot;scientific method&quot; refers not to one specific procedure but to different general or abstract methodological aspects characteristic of all the aforementioned fields. Important features are that the problem is formulated in a clear manner and that the evidence presented for or against a theory is public, reliable, and replicable. The last point is important so that other researchers are able to repeat the experiments to confirm or disconfirm the initial study. For this reason, various factors and variables of the situation often have to be controlled to avoid distorting influences and to ensure that subsequent measurements by other researchers yield the same results. The scientific method is a quantitative approach that aims at obtaining numerical data. This data is often described using mathematical formulas. The goal is usually to arrive at some universal generalizations that apply not just to the artificial situation of the experiment but to the world at large. Some data can only be acquired using advanced measurement instruments. In cases where the data is very complex, it is often necessary to employ sophisticated statistical techniques to draw conclusions from it.

The scientific method is often broken down into several steps. In a typical case, the procedure starts with regular observation and the collection of information. These findings then lead the scientist to formulate a hypothesis describing and explaining the observed phenomena. The next step consists in conducting an experiment designed for this specific hypothesis. The actual results of the experiment are then compared to the expected results based on one&#x27;s hypothesis. The findings may then be interpreted and published, either as a confirmation or disconfirmation of the initial hypothesis.

Two central aspects of the scientific method are observation and experimentation. This distinction is based on the idea that experimentation involves some form of manipulation or intervention. This way, the studied phenomena are actively created or shaped. For example, a biologist inserting viral DNA into a bacterium is engaged in a form of experimentation. Pure observation, on the other hand, involves studying independent entities in a passive manner. This is the case, for example, when astronomers observe the orbits of astronomical objects far away. Observation played the main role in ancient science. The scientific revolution in the 16th and 17th century affected a paradigm change that gave a much more central role to experimentation in the scientific methodology. This is sometimes expressed by stating that modern science actively &quot;puts questions to nature&quot;. While the distinction is usually clear in the paradigmatic cases, there are also many intermediate cases where it is not obvious whether they should be characterized as observation or as experimentation.

A central discussion in this field concerns the distinction between the inductive and the hypothetico-deductive methodology. The core disagreement between these two approaches concerns their understanding of the confirmation of scientific theories. The inductive approach holds that a theory is confirmed or supported by all its positive instances, i.e. by all the observations that exemplify it. For example, the observations of many white swans confirm the universal hypothesis that &quot;all swans are white&quot;. The hypothetico-deductive approach, on the other hand, focuses not on positive instances but on deductive consequences of the theory. This way, the researcher uses deduction before conducting an experiment to infer what observations they expect. These expectations are then compared to the observations they actually make. This approach often takes a negative form based on falsification. In this regard, positive instances do not confirm a hypothesis but negative instances disconfirm it. Positive indications that the hypothesis is true are only given indirectly if many attempts to find counterexamples have failed. A cornerstone of this approach is the null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no connection (see causality) between whatever is being observed. It is up to the researcher to do all they can to disprove their own hypothesis through relevant methods or techniques, documented in a clear and replicable process. If they fail to do so, it can be concluded that the null hypothesis is false, which provides support for their own hypothesis about the relation between the observed phenomena.

=== Social sciences ===
Significantly more methodological variety is found in the social sciences, where both quantitative and qualitative approaches are used. They employ various forms of data collection, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, and the nominal group technique. Surveys belong to quantitative research and usually involve some form of questionnaire given to a large group of individuals. It is paramount that the questions are easily understandable by the participants since the answers might not have much value otherwise. Surveys normally restrict themselves to closed questions in order to avoid various problems that come with the interpretation of answers to open questions. They contrast in this regard to interviews, which put more emphasis on the individual participant and often involve open questions. Structured interviews are planned in advance and have a fixed set of questions given to each individual. They contrast with unstructured interviews, which are closer to a free-flow conversation and require more improvisation on the side of the interviewer for finding interesting and relevant questions. Semi-structured interviews constitute a middle ground: they include both predetermined questions and questions not planned in advance. Structured interviews make it easier to compare the responses of the different participants and to draw general conclusions. However, they also limit what may be discovered and thus constrain the investigation in many ways. Depending on the type and depth of the interview, this method belongs either to quantitative or to qualitative research. The terms research conversation and muddy interview have been used to describe interviews conducted in informal settings which may not occur purely for the purposes of data collection. Some researcher employ the go-along method by conducting interviews while they and the participants navigate through and engage with their environment.

Focus groups are a qualitative research method often used in market research. They constitute a form of group interview involving a small number of demographically similar people. Researchers can use this method to collect data based on the interactions and responses of the participants. The interview often starts by asking the participants about their opinions on the topic under investigation, which may, in turn, lead to a free exchange in which the group members express and discuss their personal views. An important advantage of focus groups is that they can provide insight into how ideas and understanding operate in a cultural context. However, it is usually difficult to use these insights to discern more general patterns true for a wider public. One advantage of focus groups is that they can help the researcher identify a wide range of distinct perspectives on the issue in a short time. The group interaction may also help clarify and expand interesting contributions. One disadvantage is due to the moderator&#x27;s personality and &quot;group effects&quot;, which may influence the opinions stated by the participants. When applied to cross-cultural settings, cultural and linguistic adaptations and group composition considerations are important to encourage greater participation in the group discussion.

The nominal group technique is similar to focus groups with a few important differences. The group often consists of experts in the field in question. The group size is similar but the interaction between the participants is more structured. The goal is to determine how much agreement there is among the experts on the different issues. The initial responses are often given in written form by each participant without a prior conversation between them. In this manner, group effects potentially influencing the expressed opinions are minimized. In later steps, the different responses and comments may be discussed and compared to each other by the group as a whole.

Most of these forms of data collection involve some type of observation. Observation can take place either in a natural setting, i.e. the &quot;field&quot;, or in a controlled setting such as a laboratory. Controlled settings carry with them the risk of distorting the results due to their artificiality. Their advantage lies in precisely controlling the relevant factors, which can help make the observations more reliable and repeatable. Non-participatory observation involves a distanced or external approach. In this case, the researcher focuses on describing and recording the observed phenomena without causing or changing them, in contrast to participatory observation.

An important methodological debate in the field of social sciences concerns the question of whether they deal with hard, objective, and value-neutral facts, as the natural sciences do. Positivists agree with this characterization, in contrast to interpretive and critical perspectives on the social sciences. According to William Neumann, positivism can be defined as &quot;an organized method for combining deductive logic with precise empirical observations of individual behavior in order to discover and confirm a set of probabilistic causal laws that can be used to predict general patterns of human activity&quot;. This view is rejected by interpretivists. Max Weber, for example, argues that the method of the natural sciences is inadequate for the social sciences. Instead, more importance is placed on meaning and how people create and maintain their social worlds. The critical methodology in social science is associated with Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. It is based on the assumption that many of the phenomena studied using the other approaches are mere distortions or surface illusions. It seeks to uncover deeper structures of the material world hidden behind these distortions. This approach is often guided by the goal of helping people effect social changes and improvements.

=== Philosophy ===

Philosophical methodology is the metaphilosophical field of inquiry studying the methods used in philosophy. These methods structure how philosophers conduct their research, acquire knowledge, and select between competing theories. It concerns both descriptive issues of what methods have been used by philosophers in the past and normative issues of which methods should be used. Many philosophers emphasize that these methods differ significantly from the methods found in the natural sciences in that they usually do not rely on experimental data obtained through measuring equipment. Which method one follows can have wide implications for how philosophical theories are constructed, what theses are defended, and what arguments are cited in favor or against. In this regard, many philosophical disagreements have their source in methodological disagreements. Historically, the discovery of new methods, like methodological skepticism and the phenomenological method, has had important impacts on the philosophical discourse.

A great variety of methods has been employed throughout the history of philosophy. Methodological skepticism gives special importance to the role of systematic doubt. This way, philosophers try to discover absolutely certain first principles that are indubitable. The geometric method starts from such first principles and employs deductive reasoning to construct a comprehensive philosophical system based on them. Phenomenology gives particular importance to how things appear to be. It consists in suspending one&#x27;s judgments about whether these things actually exist in the external world. This technique is known as epoché and can be used to study appearances independent of assumptions about their causes. The method of conceptual analysis came to particular prominence with the advent of analytic philosophy. It studies concepts by breaking them down into their most fundamental constituents to clarify their meaning. Common sense philosophy uses common and widely accepted beliefs as a philosophical tool. They are used to draw interesting conclusions. This is often employed in a negative sense to discredit radical philosophical positions that go against common sense. Ordinary language philosophy has a very similar method: it approaches philosophical questions by looking at how the corresponding terms are used in ordinary language.

Many methods in philosophy rely on some form of intuition. They are used, for example, to evaluate thought experiments, which involve imagining situations to assess their possible consequences in order to confirm or refute philosophical theories. The method of reflective equilibrium tries to form a coherent perspective by examining and reevaluating all the relevant beliefs and intuitions. Pragmatists focus on the practical consequences of philosophical theories to assess whether they are true or false. Experimental philosophy is a recently developed approach that uses the methodology of social psychology and the cognitive sciences for gathering empirical evidence and justifying philosophical claims.

=== Mathematics ===
In the field of mathematics, various methods can be distinguished, such as synthetic, analytic, deductive, inductive, and heuristic methods. For example, the difference between synthetic and analytic methods is that the former start from the known and proceed to the unknown while the latter seek to find a path from the unknown to the known. Geometry textbooks often proceed using the synthetic method. They start by listing known definitions and axioms and proceed by taking inferential steps, one at a time, until the solution to the initial problem is found. An important advantage of the synthetic method is its clear and short logical exposition. One disadvantage is that it is usually not obvious in the beginning that the steps taken lead to the intended conclusion. This may then come as a surprise to the reader since it is not explained how the mathematician knew in the beginning which steps to take. The analytic method often reflects better how mathematicians actually make their discoveries. For this reason, it is often seen as the better method for teaching mathematics. It starts with the intended conclusion and tries to find another formula from which it can be deduced. It then goes on to apply the same process to this new formula until it has traced back all the way to already proven theorems. The difference between the two methods concerns primarily how mathematicians think and present their proofs. The two are equivalent in the sense that the same proof may be presented either way.

=== Statistics ===

Statistics investigates the analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It plays a central role in many forms of quantitative research that have to deal with the data of many observations and measurements. In such cases, data analysis is used to cleanse, transform, and model the data to arrive at practically useful conclusions. There are numerous methods of data analysis. They are usually divided into descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics restricts itself to the data at hand. It tries to summarize the most salient features and present them in insightful ways. This can happen, for example, by visualizing its distribution or by calculating indices such as the mean or the standard deviation. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, uses this data based on a sample to draw inferences about the population at large. That can take the form of making generalizations and predictions or by assessing the probability of a concrete hypothesis.

=== Pedagogy ===

Pedagogy can be defined as the study or science of teaching methods. In this regard, it is the methodology of education: it investigates the methods and practices that can be applied to fulfill the aims of education. These aims include the transmission of knowledge as well as fostering skills and character traits. Its main focus is on teaching methods in the context of regular schools. But in its widest sense, it encompasses all forms of education, both inside and outside schools. In this wide sense, pedagogy is concerned with &quot;any conscious activity by one person designed to enhance learning in another&quot;. The teaching happening this way is a process taking place between two parties: teachers and learners. Pedagogy investigates how the teacher can help the learner undergo experiences that promote their understanding of the subject matter in question.

Various influential pedagogical theories have been proposed. Mental-discipline theories were already common in ancient Greek and state that the main goal of teaching is to train intellectual capacities. They are usually based on a certain ideal of the capacities, attitudes, and values possessed by educated people. According to naturalistic theories, there is an inborn natural tendency in children to develop in a certain way. For them, pedagogy is about how to help this process happen by ensuring that the required external conditions are set up. Herbartianism identifies five essential components of teaching: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application. They correspond to different phases of the educational process: getting ready for it, showing new ideas, bringing these ideas in relation to known ideas, understanding the general principle behind their instances, and putting what one has learned into practice. Learning theories focus primarily on how learning takes place and formulate the proper methods of teaching based on these insights. One of them is apperception or association theory, which understands the mind primarily in terms of associations between ideas and experiences. On this view, the mind is initially a blank slate. Learning is a form of developing the mind by helping it establish the right associations. Behaviorism is a more externally oriented learning theory. It identifies learning with classical conditioning, in which the learner&#x27;s behavior is shaped by presenting them with a stimulus with the goal of evoking and solidifying the desired response pattern to this stimulus.

The choice of which specific method is best to use depends on various factors, such as the subject matter and the learner&#x27;s age. Interest and curiosity on the side of the student are among the key factors of learning success. This means that one important aspect of the chosen teaching method is to ensure that these motivational forces are maintained, through intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. Many forms of education also include regular assessment of the learner&#x27;s progress, for example, in the form of tests. This helps to ensure that the teaching process is successful and to make adjustments to the chosen method if necessary.

==Related concepts==
Methodology has several related concepts, such as &quot;paradigm&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot;. In the context of science, a paradigm is a conceptual worldview. It consists of a number of basic concepts and general theories, that determine how the studied phenomena are to be conceptualized and which scientific methods are considered reliable for studying them. Various theorists emphasize similar aspects of methodologies, for example, that they shape the general outlook on the studied phenomena and help the researcher see them in a new light.

In computer science, an algorithm is a procedure or methodology to reach the solution of a problem with a finite number of steps. Each step has to be precisely defined so it can be carried out in an unambiguous manner for each application. For example, the Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm that solves the problem of finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. It is based on simple steps like comparing the two numbers and subtracting one from the other.

<text>Sunil Dutt (born Balraj Raghunath Dutt; 6 June 1929 – 25 May 2005) was an Indian actor, film producer, director and politician. He is one of the greatest actors in Indian Cinema known for his versatility and charming personality. He is also well known for his humanitarian work and compassion both on and off screen. He was the recipient of three Filmfare Awards, including two for Best Actor. He was honoured with Padma Shri, in 1968, by the Government of India, for his contribution to Indian cinema.

Dutt debuted in 1955 with the Hindi film &quot;Railway Platform&quot;. He rose to prominence with highly successful and acclaimed films, such as &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; (1956) and &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and went on to deliver a number of hugely popular films in a career that spanned 48 years. He played variety of roles in his career like romantic hero, anti-hero, sophisticated man, buffoon lover, dacoit and strict father.In 1995, he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to the film industry for four decades.

Dutt married his &quot;Mother India&quot; co-star Nargis in 1958. Together they had three children, including the actor Sanjay Dutt. In 1984 he joined the Indian National Congress party and was elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the constituency of Mumbai North West. He was the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in the Manmohan Singh government (2004–2005) and also a former Sheriff of Mumbai. He also used his political resources to propagate several principles. He believed, &quot;Secularism means being a good person who respects all religions.&quot;

==Early life==
Sunil Dutt was born on 6 June 1929 in Nakka Khurd in the Jhelum District of the Punjab Province of British India (now in Punjab, Pakistan) into a Punjabi Hindu family of the Hussaini Brahmin caste, as Balraj Dutt to father Diwan Raghunath Dutt and mother Kulwantidevi Dutt.

Dutt belonged to a family of landlords. When he was five years old, Dutt&#x27;s father died. When he was 18, the Partition of India began inciting Hindu-Muslim violence across the country. A Muslim friend of Dutt&#x27;s father named Yakub, saved their entire family. The family resettled in the small village of Mandauli on the bank of the river Yamuna, located in the Yamunanagar District of East Punjab (now in Haryana).

Later in life, Dutt moved to Lucknow in the United Provinces with his mother, Kulwantidevi Dutt, and spent a long time in the Aminabad Bazaar neighbourhood during graduation. He then moved to Bombay, where he joined Jai Hind College of the University of Bombay in the Churchgate neighbourhood of South Bombay, as an undergraduate and took up a job at the city&#x27;s BEST Transportation Engineering division. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History (Hons.) in 1954.

== Film career==

===Early career and rise to prominence (1955–1957)===

Director Ramesh Saigal was instrumental in giving Dutt a break in the film &quot;Railway Platform&quot; (1955) when the latter was hosting the show, Lipton Ki Mehfil on Radio Ceylon. While covering the Dilip Kumar film &quot;Shikast&quot; in 1953, Dutt met director Saigal, who impressed by his personality and voice, offered him a role in his upcoming film. Saigal came up with the new screen name &quot;Sunil Dutt&quot; for the debutante actor whose real name was Balraj Dutt to avoid name conflicts with the then veteran actor Balraj Sahni.

He shot to stardom with B.R. Chopra&#x27;s family drama &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; (1956) and Mehboob Khan&#x27;s epic drama &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). While &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; was a superhit, &quot;Mother India&quot; went many steps ahead and emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; along with being the most successful film of the 1950s. Even being a newcomer that time, Dutt accepted the role of anti-hero but this was the film who made him first anti-hero of Bollywood. It was dubbed in several European languages including Spanish, French and Russian; it did substantial business in Greece, Spain and Russia and was released in the Eastern Bloc countries. Technicolor arranged one screening of the film in Paris on 30 June 1958, under the name &quot;Les bracelets d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;The Gold Bracelets&quot;). It did minimal business in Paris, but fared better in French colonies. It was successful in the Latin American countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. &quot;Mother India&quot; was also acclaimed across the Arab world, in the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and North Africa and continued to be shown in countries such as Algeria at least ten years after its release. It went on to win several accolades and was also featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.

===Widespread success, setback and resurgence (1958–1979)===
He once again collaborated with B.R. Chopra for &quot;Sadhna&quot; (1958) opposite Vyjayanthimala. The film did extremely well at the box office and went on to become a superhit. The following year, he starred in Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Sujata&quot; and Shakti Samanta&#x27;s &quot;Insan Jaag Utha&quot;. While the former was a huge commercial success, &quot;Insan Jaag Utha&quot; could only manage average profits. &quot;Sujata&quot; also opened to critical acclaim and went on to win the National Film Award for Third Best Feature Film (Hindi). From 1960 to 1962, he only delivered moderately successful films, such as &quot;Hum Hindustani&quot; in 1960, &quot;Chhaya&quot; in 1961 and &quot;Main Chup Rahungi&quot; in 1962 which was a superhit. The year 1963 brought him in the big league with superhits in &quot;Gumrah&quot; and &quot;Mujhe Jeene Do&quot;. Apart from commercial success, both the films received positive reviews from critics. For his portrayal of a notorious bandit in &quot;Mujhe Jeene Do&quot;, Dutt won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 1964, he directed, produced and starred in &quot;Yaadein&quot;, an experimental film with him as the sole actor. It did not do well at the box office, but received critical praise and won National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film (Hindi) as well as an entry in Guinness Book of World Records in the category &quot;Fewest actors in a narrative film&quot;. Dutt&#x27;s performance was highly praised by viewers and &quot;Yaadein&quot; is considered as a unique film which was ahead of its time.

Dutt reached his peak in the mid-1960s. He began 1965 with Yash Chopra&#x27;s ensemble masala film &quot;Waqt&quot;. It opened to an excellent response from the audience and proved to be a major blockbuster as well as the highest-grossing film of the year. Today it is widely regarded as a cult classic. His next release was A. Bhimsingh&#x27;s family drama &quot;Khandan&quot; which also performed very well and emerged a superhit with Dutt receiving immense acclaim for his portrayal of a dedicated family man who is handicapped and winning his second and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 1966, he had a blockbuster in Raj Khosla&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Mera Saaya&quot; and a flop in Lekh Tandon&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Amrapali&quot;. The soundtrack of &quot;Mera Saaya&quot; composed by Madan Mohan was highly successful and one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1960s. Its songs, such as &quot;Jhumka Gira Re&quot; sung by Asha Bhosle and &quot;Mera Saaya Saath&quot;, a solo by Lata Mangeshkar remain popular till date. 1967 proved to be the best year of Dutt&#x27;s career with three major commercial successes. He first starred in Adurthi Subba Rao&#x27;s reincarnation drama &quot;Milan&quot;. A remake Of Telugu hit &quot;Mooga Manasulu&quot; (1964), &quot;Milan&quot; proved to be an equally successful at the box office with its songs &quot;Sawan Ka Mahina&quot;, &quot;Bol Gori Bol Tera Kaun Piya&quot; and &quot;Ram Kare Aisa Ho Jaye&quot; topping the musical chart that year. For portraying an innocent boatman in the film, Dutt received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category and won his first and only BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi). His next release was Bhimsingh&#x27;s drama film &quot;Mehrban&quot; which also had Ashok Kumar, Nutan, Mehmood, Sulochana Latkar and Shashikala in the lead where he was a dedicated and honest man. &quot;Mehrban&quot; like &quot;Milan&quot; was also a commercially successful. He concluded the year with B.R. Chopra&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;Hamraaz&quot; which received positive reviews from critics, eventually emerging a blockbuster and Dutt&#x27;s third consecutive hit of the year.

In 1968, he delivered another superhit in Jyoti Swaroop&#x27;s musical comedy film &quot;Padosan&quot; where he played a buffoon lover named Bhola. Indiatimes ranked the film among the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. Dutt surprised everyone with his comic timing. Amit Upadhaya of ThePrint in a retrospective article on film&#x27;s 50th anniversary wrote ″As cult comedy films go, Jyoti Swaroop&#x27;s &quot;Padosan&quot; is one of the few in Hindi film history to never run out of laughs. With its bare-bones plot about an innocent naïve young man Bhola, who falls in love with his dancer-singer neighbour Bindu and wins her over in a not-so-honest but oh-so-charming way, the focus in Padosan is entirely on scene mechanics and individual performances.&quot; In a similar fiftieth-anniversary article, Devansh Sharma of Firstpost gave credit to RD Burman&#x27;s soundtrack for changing the state of comedy genre in Hindi films as he felt that ″Burman&#x27;s music gave wings to the camera that was otherwise doomed to sit still. Krishan&#x27;s poetry also allowed the editor and director a lot of freedom as they could choose the appropriate shot for every emotion expressed in the songs.″

The year 1969 saw the rise of superstar Rajesh Khanna, who stormed the nation with &quot;Aradhana&quot; and &quot;Do Raaste&quot;. With his emergence, a number of stars saw a decline in their career graph and Dutt was one of them. That year Dutt only saw success with Raj Khosla&#x27;s &quot;Chirag&quot; and Khalid Akhtar&#x27;s &quot;Meri Bhabhi&quot; while the rest of his films didn&#x27;t do well. The series of failures continued from 1970 to 1972 with films, including &quot;Reshma Aur Shera&quot; (which he also directed), &quot;Zindagi Zindagi&quot;, &quot;Zameen Aasmaan&quot; and &quot;Jai Jwala&quot;. However, his &quot;Bhai Bhai&quot; in 1970 did moderate success at the box office. The year 1973 marked Dutt&#x27;s return to the big league with Sultan Ahmed&#x27;s dacoit drama &quot;Heera&quot;, which proved to be a massive hit. The huge box office success of &quot;Heera&quot; was followed by superhits, &quot;Pran Jaye Per Vachan Na Jaye&quot; (1974) and &quot;Zakhmee&quot; (1975) along with two more successful films, &quot;Geeta Mera Naam&quot; (1974) and &quot;Umar Qaid&quot; (1975). His performance in the respective movies was highly praised by audience thus solidifying his comeback.

In 1976, Dutt had two releases - Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s horror film &quot;Nagin&quot; and Raj Khosla&#x27;s action drama &quot;Nehle Pe Dehla&quot;. The former which had an ensemble cast, including Reena Roy, Feroz Khan, Sanjay Khan, Rekha and Mumtaz went on to become a blockbuster at the box office. On the other hand, &quot;Nehle Pe Dehla&quot; alongside Saira Banu and Vinod Khanna was also a major commercial success. The following year, he delivered two more successes with &quot;Paapi&quot; and &quot;Aakhri Goli&quot;. In 1978, Dutt donned the director&#x27;s hat for &quot;Daaku Aur Jawan&quot;, co-starring Vinod Khanna, Reena Roy and Leena Chandavarkar. The film opened to positive response from critics and emerged a superhit at the box office. He also appeared opposite Rekha and Saira Banu in &quot;Ram Kasam&quot; and &quot;Kaala Aadmi&quot;, respectively. While the former was a commercially successful venture, &quot;Kaala Aadmi&quot; failed to do well. In 1979, he reunited with Rajkumar Kohli for another multi-starrer horror film &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot;, which took a bumper opening and emerged a blockbuster as well as one of the highest-earners of that year. Dutt once again collaborated with Kohli for &quot;Muqabla&quot;, the same year. The film backed up with chartbuster song &quot;Govinda Govinda&quot;, a duet by Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar went on to become a hit at the box office. He concluded the year with another critical and commercial success in the action drama film &quot;Ahinsa&quot;.

===Shift to character roles, hiatus and final works (1980–2003)===

Dutt began the new decade with a pivotal supporting role in Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s mega-budget action crime drama &quot;Shaan&quot; (1980). The film received positive reviews from critics, but ended up as a moderately successful venture due to its high costs. In 1981, he launched his son Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s career with &quot;Rocky&quot; which was a hit. Shortly before the film&#x27;s release, Nargis died of pancreatic cancer. Dutt founded the &quot;Nargis Dutt Foundation&quot; in her memory for the care of cancer patients. In 1982, he appeared alongside Dharmendra and Jeetendra in Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Badle Ki Aag&quot;, which was a box office success. The following year, he directed, produced and starred in the drama film &quot;Dard Ka Rishta&quot;, alongside Ashok Kumar, Reena Roy, Smita Patil and Khushbu Sundar. Despite its heavy theme, &quot;Dard Ka Rishta&quot; did well commercially and proved to be a hit venture. Dutt followed it with a minor setback as he had a string of critical and commercial failures from 1984 to 1985 with films, such as - &quot;Raaj Tilak&quot;, &quot;Laila&quot;, &quot;Yaadon Ki Zanjeer&quot; and &quot;Faasle&quot;. This changed in 1986 with the critically acclaimed venture &quot;Kala Dhanda Goray Log&quot; and a hit in &quot;Watan Ke Rakhwale&quot;, the next year.

After appearing in &quot;Dharamyudh&quot; (1988), he went on a brief hiatus and returned to big screen in 1991 with &quot;Yeh Aag Kab Bujhegi&quot; (which he also directed), &quot;Kurbaan&quot; and &quot;Pratigyabadh&quot;. While the lattermost was a box office failure, &quot;Yeh Aag Kab Bujhegi&quot; proved to be an average fare and &quot;Kurbaan&quot; emerged a major commercial success. He followed it with another success in &quot;Virodhi&quot; (1992) and three more films in 1993 which were - &quot;Parampara&quot;, &quot;Phool&quot; and &quot;Kshatriya&quot; before taking retirement from films to focus on his political career.

Dutt returned to films once again in 2003 with Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s satirical comedy drama &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; which had his son in the lead. &quot;Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.&quot; opened to highly positive reviews from critics and proved to be a commercially successful. Today it is considered a classic and one of the best films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. It was Sunil Dutt&#x27;s last film; he died after two years of its release.

==Political career==
In 1982, he was appointed as the Sheriff of Bombay, an apolitical titular position bestowed on him by the Maharashtra government for a year. He was elected a Member of Parliament from Northwest Mumbai for five terms (1984, 1989, 1991 [resigned in 1993 in protest over religious violence], 1999, and 2004). He worked actively for the cause of slum dwellers, refugees and displaced people.

In 1987 when Punjab was facing heightened militancy, Dutt, accompanied by his daughter Priya undertook a 2,000 km 76 day long &quot;Mahashanti Padyatra&quot; (journey by foot) from Bombay to Amritsar (Golden Temple) to establish communal harmony and brotherhood. During the &quot;padyatra&quot;, he attended more than 500 roadside meetings and suffered a bout of jaundice and blistered feet but recovered. He always stressed that violence is not the solution.His political career was halted for some years in the early 1990s when he worked to free his son from jail after he was arrested for keeping an AK-56 that he claimed was for the protection of his family after bomb blasts in Bombay.

After his son&#x27;s release, Dutt contested in 1999 election from the same constituency and won. He was re-elected in 2004 and became Cabinet Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports in Manmohan Singh&#x27;s government. He won several accolades including the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Award for National Integration and Communal Harmony in 1997, the Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Award for International Peace, Communal Harmony, Unity and National Integration in 1997 and the Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavana Award in 1998.

==Personal life==
Dutt married actress Nargis, a Muslim, also of Punjabi Mohyal descent, on 11 March 1958. Prior to their marriage, Nargis converted to Hinduism and adopted the name Nirmala Dutt. Reportedly, Dutt had saved her life from a fire on the sets of &quot;Mother India&quot;. They had three children: Sanjay Dutt, Namrata Dutt, and Priya Dutt. Sanjay went on to become a successful film actor. Namrata married actor Kumar Gaurav, son of veteran actor Rajendra Kumar who had appeared alongside Nargis and Dutt in &quot;Mother India&quot;. Priya became a politician and a Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha).

With his wife, Dutt formed the Ajanta Arts Cultural Troupe, which involved several leading actors and singers of the time, and performed at remote frontiers to entertain the Indian soldiers at border. It was the first troupe to perform in Dhaka, after the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971.

Dutt&#x27;s wife Nargis died in 1981. One year after her death, the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation was established by Dutt in her memory.

==Death==

Dutt died of a heart attack in his sleep on 25 May 2005 at his residence in Bandra, West Mumbai, at age 75. At the time of his death, he was the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports in the Union Government led by Manmohan Singh and was the Member of Parliament from North-West Mumbai. He was cremated with full state honours at Santacruz Crematorium in Mumbai. He quoted his wish, &quot;There should be no statues or a street named after me, no postal stamp with my face or any organisation after me. I like people to remember me by my following work.&quot; He was succeeded as Minister by Mani Shankar Aiyar. After his death, his seat in the Parliament was contested by his daughter, Priya Dutt, who won it and was a Member of Parliament until May 2014.

<text>Cheltenham College is a public school (fee-charging boarding and day school for pupils aged 13–18) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. The school opened in 1841 as a Church of England foundation and is known for its linguistic, military, and sporting traditions.

==History==
Two Cheltenham residents, G. S. Harcourt and J. S. Iredell, founded the college in July 1841 to educate the sons of gentlemen. The plan to establish a &quot;Proprietary Grammar School&quot; had been agreed at a meeting of residents at Harcourt&#x27;s home on 9 November 1840. It originally opened in three houses along Bays Hill Terrace in the centre of the town.

Within two years it had moved to its present site, with Boyne House as the first College Boarding House, and soon became known simply as Cheltenham College. Accepting both boarding and day boys, it was divided into Classical and Military sides until the mid-20th century. The 1893 book &quot;Great Public Schools&quot; by E. S. Skirving, S. R. James, and Henry Churchill Maxwell Lyte contained a chapter on each of what they considered England&#x27;s ten greatest public schools; it included a chapter on Cheltenham College. The college is now an independent fee paying school, governed by Cheltenham College Council. A few girls were admitted in 1969. In 1981 the first girls&#x27; house opened and the Sixth Form became fully co-educational. In 1998, girls were admitted to all other years.

In 1865, a Junior Department was added to the main College buildings. In 1993 it opened its doors to girls and also opened a pre-Prep department, Kingfishers, for 3- to 7-year-olds.

==Student body==
Cheltenham has approximately 720 pupils (a fifth being day pupils) between the ages of 13 and 18. The fees are between approximately £34,000–£46,500 per annum, making it amongst the most expensive schools in the United Kingdom. The school claims to have a strong academic reputation, with the majority of pupils going to The Russell Group Universities, and around 7% going on to Oxford and Cambridge universities. Both GCSE and A Level results are among the highest in Gloucestershire.

Cheltenham College and Cheltenham Prep are home to over 100 international students from over 30 countries. These students all need an Educational Guardian as part of admission.

==Military tradition==
In the First World War 702 Old Cheltonians (former pupils) were killed in the service of their country, and a further 363 died in World War II. Cheltenham is one of only three schools in England to have its own military colours (last presented in 2000 by The Princess Royal). (The others are Eton College and the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School.)

=== Combined Cadet Force (CCF) ===
Cheltenham College has an affiliate tri-service Combined Cadet Force which has a history dating back to 1862. 

Cheltenham College CCF (Army Section) is attached to the Rifles Regiment, and consequently Army cadets&#x27; berets have the Rifles Bugle as their cap badge.

== Sport ==

===Rugby===
The Rugby club dates back to 1844. Cheltenham competes with larger single gender schools. The first inter-school rugby football match was played between Rugby School and Cheltenham College, Cheltenham beating Rugby. The &quot;Cheltenham Rules&quot; were adopted by the Rugby Football Union in 1887. Cheltenham&#x27;s rugby XV was undefeated in the 1957, 2008 and 2017 seasons. Eddie Butler, former Welsh, Barbarian and British Lions International Rugby player, taught French at the school. The schools Director of Rugby is former Gloucester Rugby and England Rugby player Olly Morgan.

===Rowing===
The Boat Club was founded in 1841. The Boat House itself is located at the foot of Tewkesbury Abbey on the banks of the River Severn. Key events in the rowing calendar are; Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race, The National Schools Regatta and Henley Royal Regatta. At the 2013 National School&#x27;s Head of River, the 1st IV+ came first in their division.

===Rackets===
Cheltenham College plays Rackets. At times, they have dominated the Queen&#x27;s Club Public Schools Competition: Cheltenham have been National Champions three times from 2003 to 2011. Chris Stout won the Foster Cup (the individual championship for public schools) at Queen&#x27;s Club in December 2011. The current World Champion, Jamie Stout (Chris&#x27;s brother), is an Old Cheltonian as well.

===Polo===
Cheltenham were National Schools Champions in 1997, 1998, 2004, &amp; 2005 and Arena Champions in 2004, 2005, and 2006.

===Cricket===
Cheltenham has a longstanding tradition of cricket and is the home of the Cheltenham Cricket Festival. Gloucestershire County Cricket Club played its first game at the College cricket ground in 1872, making this the longest running cricket festival on an out-ground, in the world.

==In popular culture and media==
Cheltenham College was used to film the majority of the school scenes in the popular 1968 British film &quot;If...&quot;, starring Malcolm McDowell, although an agreement between the school&#x27;s then Headmaster, David Ashcroft, and the film&#x27;s director, Lindsay Anderson (who was a former pupil and Senior Prefect), prevented the filmmakers from crediting the school. Additional interior scenes were filmed at Aldenham School in Hertfordshire, which gained sole accreditation in the film&#x27;s closing credit.

<text>Rituals is an American soap opera that aired in first-run syndication from September 10, 1984, to September 6, 1985. Developed by Gene Palumbo, Clifford Champion, Joyce Corrington and John William Corrington, it was loosely based on a novel of the same name by Charlene Keel. Distributed by Telepictures, 260 25-minute episodes were produced over its single-season run.

== Storylines ==

The show took place in the fictional Virginia town of Wingfield. The community was the home of Wingfield Mills and Chapin Industries, the town&#x27;s leading employers. Also located in Wingfield was a boarding school for girls called Haddon Hall. The story focused on the Chapin, Gallagher and Robertson families and the people who were connected with them either socially or professionally.

The story began with the death of Chapin family matriarch Katherine, and while everyone mourned her, her long-absent daughter, Taylor, stepped off a helicopter holding a racehorse&#x27;s victory wreath. Katherine&#x27;s will was read, setting off a round of battles and squabbles over the will.

Much of the focus of the show was set at Haddon Hall, which was run by president Carter Robertson, who didn&#x27;t much like the Chapin family. Even when he was discovered to be Patrick Chapin&#x27;s illegitimate son, he didn&#x27;t change his views on the family. He was married to Christina Robertson, whose sister, Sara, was married to sleazy Eddie Gallagher, a working-class man, who was shot and killed in self-defense by his daughter, Haddon Hall student Noel, for years of physical and sexual abuse. (This was the result of an on-air contest to discover the victim, the killer, and the motive.)

The series ended its syndicated run in 1985.

== Characters ==

===The Robertsons===
* Carter Robertson Chapin (Monte Markham) Husband of Christina and Headmaster of girls school, Haddon Hall. He is the illegitimate son of Patrick Chapin (and was originally thought to be the son of the Chapin family butler), father of Jeff. Was run down by a car, and used a wheelchair for mobility. After he divorced Christina, he later married Marissa Mallory (but annulled it when it was revealed he was still married to Christina); and after his divorce was finalized, married Christina&#x27;s youngest sister, Lisa. 
* Christina Robertson Chapin (née Thompson) (Christine Jones) Wife of Carter and sister of Sara Gallagher and Lisa Thompson. She was a close friend of the late Katherine Chapin and was given the Chapin Diamond as a result. She later divorced Carter (in between she had an affair with Patrick Chapin, which led to his death and enmity with his daughter, Taylor Von Platen) and eventually attempted to marry C.J. Field, but she shot and wounded him and killed Sara. She and C.J. divorced after realizing she couldn&#x27;t live with having killed her sister. As a result of what happened, she later became a nun and spoke the final lines in the series, &quot;Each person&#x27;s life is unique, but the rituals remain the same.&quot; 
* Jeff Robertson Chapin (Tim Maier) Son of Carter and Christina. In the beginning, a student at Harvard, but after being beaten up by Eddie Gallagher, lived in Wingfield again. Best friend of Brady Chapin, who later became his uncle. Turns out to be as scheming as his parents were.

===The Chapins===
* Patrick Chapin (Dennis Patrick) Head of the Chapin family. Head of Wingfield Mills and Chapin Industries, as well as one of the wealthiest people in Wingfield. The Chapin family, who live at an estate called The Willows, also were the founders of Haddon Hall, Wingfield&#x27;s local women&#x27;s college (Oakwood was the male equivalent of Haddon Hall, and was not that far away from Wingfield). He is the father of Brady, Taylor, Carter Robertson and Michele Davenport (via Sarah Gallagher); and the grandfather of Julia Field. The funeral of his wife, Katherine (née Haddon), was the opening scene of the show which eventually sets in motion most of the plotlines. He eventually died himself as a result of a heart attack, while in a romantic clinch with Christina Robertson, who had fallen in love with him.
* Brady Chapin (Marc Poppel in 1984, Jon Lindstrom from 1984–1985) Son of Patrick, brother of Taylor, and half-brother of Carter Robertson and Michele Davenport. He is an irresponsible playboy (who also had a cocaine addiction), but was also a champion horseback rider. He fell in love with Dakota Lane, aggravating his ex-girlfriend, Noel Gallagher.

Head of the board of trustees at Haddon Hall. a crassly materialistic and money-mad woman, she was married five times (one of which was to C.J. Field, with whom she procreated Julia). Taylor is resented by her daughter (due to her continual neglecting of her) and they clashed repeatedly. She made her first appearance interrupting her mother&#x27;s funeral by stepping off a helicopter with a race horse&#x27;s victory wreath. She is also involved with Logan Williams, although she is angered at him for being the executor of her mother&#x27;s will. She had affairs with a lot of men, including Bernhardt Kraus (mainly to aggravate Julia). She gained a personal assistant in hard-working student Patty DuPont, whom she matched up with Bernhardt. Had a rivalry with Christina Robertson when she embarked on an affair with her father. 
** Carson &quot;C.J.&quot; Field (Peter Haskell) Wealthy former husband of Taylor Chapin and father of Julia. He helped the Chapin family out of financial straits when he married Taylor. He became Governor of Virginia and fell in love with Sarah Gallagher after her first husband&#x27;s death. They were engaged and were happy until her sister, Christina, killed her and wounded him. He married Christina, but they divorced soon after the marriage because she couldn&#x27;t live with what she had done to them.

** Julia Chapin Field (Andrea Moar) Daughter of Taylor Chapin and C.J. Field. She resents her absentee mother, Taylor (with whom she clashes repeatedly over the series run), which prompts her to have a closer relationship with her father (which came over time as she felt neglected by him as well). In order for her to acquire her grandmother, Katherine&#x27;s jewelry, she has to remain in Wingfield and graduate from Haddon Hall, which she did. At first very headstrong and spoiled (due to her parents neglect), but with time, she mellows and becomes more mature, becoming Dakota Lane&#x27;s closest friend and staunchest supporter. Has doomed relationships with Logan Williams (which her mother stopped); Bernhardt Kraus (whom she was engaged to, which was also stopped by her mother) and Luther &quot;Lucky&quot; Washington (which was again stopped but by her whole family this time), half-sister of Mark Field.

<doc id="620674" wikidata="Q12486185" url="?curid=620674" title="Iain Moncreiffe">
<text>Sir Rupert Iain Kay Moncreiffe of that Ilk, 11th Baronet, (9 April 1919 – 27 February 1985), Chief of Clan Moncreiffe, was a British Officer of Arms, historian and genealogist.

==Biography==
Moncreiffe was the son of Lieutenant-Commander Gerald Moncreiffe, RN, and Hilda, daughter of the Comte de Miremont. He succeeded his cousin as 11th Baronet and Chief of Clan Moncreiffe in 1957.

Educated at Stowe School, Heidelberg, and Christ Church, Oxford, as a cadet officer Moncreiffe trained with Derek Bond (actor) and Patrick Leigh Fermor, he later served in Scots Guards during the Second World War, then as attaché at the British embassy in Moscow, before studying Scots Law at the University of Edinburgh. He was awarded a PhD (1958) with a thesis on the Origins and Background of the Law of Succession to Arms and Dignities in Scotland, which was published as a monograph in 2010.

A prominent member of the Lyon Court, Moncreiffe held the offices of Falkland Pursuivant (1952), Kintyre Pursuivant (1953), Unicorn Pursuivant (1955), and (from 1961) Albany Herald. He wrote a popular work about the Scottish clans, &quot;The Highland Clans&quot; (1967), and with Don Pottinger &quot;Simple Heraldry, Cheerfully Illustrated&quot; (1953), &quot;Simple Custom&quot; (1954), and &quot;Blood Royal&quot; (1956), but his interests also extended to Georgian and Byzantine noble genealogies. &quot;Lord of the Dance, A Moncreiffe Miscellany&quot;, edited by Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd encompassed his genealogical world-view.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists in 1969.

He was an incorrigible snob; he even called himself Master Snob. He took silk (relatively late in his career) because very few barristers specialised in heraldic matters and he wished to highlight the importance of this field of speciality. He was a frequent writer of amusing and often illuminating letters to newspapers, particularly &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and provided the introduction to Douglas Sutherland&#x27;s satirical book &quot;The English Gentleman&quot; (1978). He held membership in many London clubs and founded his own club in Edinburgh, called Puffin&#x27;s Club, – the name was taken from the nickname of Sir Iain&#x27;s first wife, &#x27;Puffin&#x27;, Diana Hay, 23rd Countess of Erroll. It was and continues to be a weekly luncheon club, which between the early 1960s and late 1990s met in Martin&#x27;s restaurant in Rose Street Lane North, Edinburgh. It still meets monthly in London and Edinburgh. The membership was and is as varied and eccentric as its founder. Ex-King Zog I, King of Albania paid his founding subscription of £5 in 1961, but died before he could attend. The actor Terence Stamp, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, Sir Fitzroy Maclean and Lord Dacre all attended with varying frequency. It was said that at some point half the crowned heads of Europe were on the list.

==Family==
Moncreiffe married twice. Firstly Diana Hay, 23rd Countess of Erroll, whom he married on 19 December 1946 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. They had three children:
* Merlin Sereld Victor Gilbert Hay, 24th Earl of Erroll, Chief of Clan Hay (b. 20 April 1948).
* Hon. Peregrine David Euan Malcolm Moncreiffe of that Ilk, Chief of Clan Moncreiffe (b. 16 February 1951), married in 1988 Miranda Mary Fox-Pitt (b. 29 December 1968).
* Lady Alexandra Victoria Caroline Anne Moncreiffe Hay (b. 30 July 1955), married Jolyon Connell (b. 16 May 1952); they have two daughters, Flora Diana Catharine Cecelia Connell (b. 24 February 1990) and Ciara Edith Elisabeth Connell (b. 28 March 1994). Lady Alexandra also has a son, Ivar Francis Grey de Miremont Wigan.

Moncreiffe&#x27;s first marriage was dissolved in 1964 and in 1966 he took as his second wife Hermione Patricia Faulkner, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Douglas Faulkner and Patricia Katherine Montagu Douglas Scott.

<text>Marvin Harold Zindler (August 10, 1921 – July 29, 2007) was a news reporter for television station KTRK-TV in Houston, Texas, United States. His investigative journalism, through which he mostly represented the city&#x27;s elderly and working class, made him one of the city&#x27;s most influential and well-known media personalities.

==Early life==
Zindler attended Pershing Middle School and Lamar High School in Houston before graduating from San Jacinto High School in Houston. He went on to John Tarleton Agricultural College (now Tarleton State University) in Stephenville, Texas. In 1941, when the United States entered World War II, Zindler joined the United States Marine Corps and later received an honorable discharge for medical reasons.

Zindler&#x27;s father, Abe Zindler, who founded and owned a successful clothing store in Houston, was disappointed in Marvin, whom Abe considered frivolous and irresponsible. Abe wanted his sons to inherit the store, a career course that Marvin was reluctant to take because of his father&#x27;s sometimes angry behavior. When Abe died in 1963, Marvin&#x27;s inheritance was instead allocated to a trust for Zindler&#x27;s children.

==Early career==
Zindler began his broadcasting career in 1943 as a part-time night radio disc jockey and spot news reporter at Houston radio station KATL (the current-day KMIC (1590)) while working for his family&#x27;s clothing store. Beginning in 1951, when he worked for KATL, he hosted &quot;The Roving Mike&quot;, a 30-minute radio program airing on Sundays that documented crime and the people involved in Houston. In 1950 Zindler became a reporter and cameraman for Southwest Film Production Company which produced the 6 p.m. news for KPRC-TV, but in 1954, he was fired by an executive who said he was &quot;too ugly&quot; to work in TV. Two years later, Zindler joined the Scripps Howard &quot;Houston Press&quot; to work part-time as a crime reporter and photographer. While working for the newspaper and his father&#x27;s store, Zindler became dissatisfied with the retail business and in 1962 took a career detour to join the Harris County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. He handled Civil Process for two years and then joined the Fugitive Squad where his work took him all over the world to extradite fugitives.

Two years before joining KTRK-TV, Zindler was assigned by the Sheriff and District Attorney to establish a Consumer Fraud Division with the Harris County District Attorney&#x27;s Office. This division is still in operation today. It was during this time of his career that he got his first taste of working on behalf of people. After Jack Heard was elected Sheriff of Harris County in 1972, Zindler was unceremoniously let go, a move that Zindler blamed on agitated car dealers who were alleged to have been rolling back odometers.

==At KTRK-TV==
Upon news of Zindler&#x27;s departure from the Harris County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, KTRK anchor Dave Ward recommended Zindler to the station&#x27;s assistant news director. On January 1, 1973, Marvin Zindler joined KTRK, a station with a news program languishing in third place.

===The &quot;Chicken Ranch&quot; story===
Zindler made local and national headlines when he and fellow journalist Larry Conners reported on a long-lived brothel known as the &quot;Chicken Ranch&quot; in Fayette County, Texas, near La Grange, which led to its closure in 1973. The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; magazine, two 1974 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, was the basis for the Broadway and film musical &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, in which the character of Melvin P. Thorpe was based on Zindler. It also served as the basis of the song &quot;La Grange&quot; by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched toupee. Reportedly, Flournoy waved the hairpiece in the air as if it were a prized enemy scalp and threw it in the street.

Governor Dolph Briscoe closed the operation, only to have it open again after a few months. Then Zindler stepped in to shed more light on the operation, which led to its being closed for good.

===Lifetime contract===
The story, along with his trademark reporting style, was instrumental in Zindler signing an unprecedented lifetime contract with Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. and KTRK-TV in September 1988, which he honored. The last story filed was to help an American citizen obtain a Social Security card. Zindler had been a primary factor in KTRK&#x27;s rise from a perennial third in the ratings to its usual number one position.

===&quot;Rat and Roach Report&quot;===
Zindler was also famed in Houston for his self-described &quot;Rat and Roach Report&quot;, where he read details from his controversial City of Houston Food Inspection Program restaurant reports on the air. These reports soon became famous for Zindler&#x27;s enthusiastic reports of &quot;sliiiiime in the ice machine!&quot;, which quickly became a catchphrase of his, and eventually given their own subsection at the end of the reports. Hundreds, if not thousands, of restaurants in Greater Houston have made at least one appearance on his reports. KTRK-TV&#x27;s own commissary was cited on one occasion.

Zindler&#x27;s Rat and Roach Reports were traditionally broadcast on Friday nights live during KTRK&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast and rebroadcast later during the station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast.

Two spin-off segments resulted from these reports:
*In the first spin-off, Marvin Zindler also rewarded restaurants for operating clean kitchens continuously with his &quot;Blue Ribbon Awards,&quot; which was done in his final years with local beauty pageant contestants giving the envelopes of the winning restaurants to Zindler.
*The other spin-off showcased places where Zindler preferred to dine, called &quot;Where Marvin Likes to Eat...&quot;. Most of these restaurants were locally based restaurants, while a handful of them were national chains, including McDonald&#x27;s and Ruth&#x27;s Chris Steak House. But Zindler&#x27;s favorite place to eat, which was seen in the last segment of this spin-off feature, was his home.

On Friday nights, Zindler also gave viewers additional good wishes just before his traditional sign-off: &quot;Have a good weekend good golf, good tennis, or whatever makes you happy.&quot;

===Other stories===
Zindler&#x27;s reports on KTRK also included international stories, many involving trips to various third-world countries; segments in which local business owners (known as Marvin&#x27;s Angels) provided services to people in dire financial or physical health; and stories focused on the elderly, including nursing home abuse investigations. On his Friday reports, Zindler had also reported birthday and wedding anniversary greetings on air, usually involving those celebrating their 100th birthday or at least a 50th wedding anniversary. The station has stated that over 100,000 requests for help from Zindler were received yearly. In choosing stories, Zindler focused on two factors – neediness and chance of success. While low income was a key factor, being selected for a story had more to do with an injustice than with income.

Marvin Zindler&#x27;s trademark signoff at the end of each report was, nearly shouting: &quot;Marvin Zindler... Eyewitness News.&quot;

==Honors==
Zindler was the recipient of hundreds of awards from news organizations, charity groups, and medical professionals. The Plastic Surgeons of America honored Zindler for his openness and honesty in talking about his cosmetic surgeries and for the help he obtained for charity patients who desperately needed reconstructive surgery. He was a Freemason, a member of Temple Lodge #4 in Houston and was particularly proud of the 33rd Degree that was conferred upon him by the Scottish Rite.

==Personal life==
Zindler was Jewish. In 1941, he married his first wife, the former Gertrude S. Kugler (May 30, 1921 – November 28, 1997). They had five children together; Marvin Jr., Donny, Danny, Mark and Helen. When Gertrude died, Zindler vowed he would never marry again, yet he fell in love with Niki Devine and married her in 2006. Before his death, Marvin and Niki Zindler lived in the Houston neighborhood of Maplewood, where Zindler had lived continuously for forty-eight years. They were the owners of a dog, Magic, a bichon frisé. Additionally, Zindler owned a cat, Sugar, who died in 2006. At the time of his death, Zindler had five children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

At one point in the 1970s, Zindler considered running for Congress as a Republican, and the local GOP commissioned surveys that predicted he would win. However, Gertrude was hesitant to leave Houston, and the plans were dropped. Also, Zindler described himself as a social liberal who supported universal health care and the feminist movement. He had initially been a Democrat and a Lyndon B. Johnson supporter. Zindler&#x27;s father was a four-term mayor of suburban Bellaire and was also a liberal; he was a card-carrying member of the NAACP and opponent of the Ku Klux Klan and his clothing store was among a handful of Houston businesses that advertised in African-American newspapers.

Zindler was known for wearing makeup continually, loved cigars, and was a frequent golfer. He had his own producer and cameraman as well as his own editing suite at KTRK. Zindler was also noted for his seventeen cosmetic surgeries, the first of which took place in 1954 after the KPRC-TV firing. KTRK&#x27;s longtime investigative reporter, Wayne Dolcefino, has described Zindler&#x27;s eccentric behavior in the office, including loud phone conversations (which Dolcefino attributed to his poor hearing) and trademark zealous pursuit of reports.

On November 10, 1999, Zindler appeared on KTRK&#x27;s locally produced mid-morning talk show at the time, &quot;Debra Duncan&quot; as the show paid tribute to him as well as talking about his life and legacy.

===Illness and death===
On July 5, 2007, it was announced on KTRK&#x27;s 6:00 p.m. newscast that Zindler was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer that had also spread to his liver. In a news conference, Zindler said he would continue to work. Zindler stated that he planned to stay on the air as his illness was treated, even doing restaurant reports and greetings from his bedside. Zindler died from the cancer at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in the Texas Medical Center in Houston on July 29, 2007, two nights after what would turn out to be his final newscast.

Zindler&#x27;s funeral took place on Wednesday, August 1, 2007 at Congregation Beth Israel of Houston. ABC-13 staff members and Houston-area religious figures, such as Joel Osteen, Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza, Reverend Bill Lawson (anchor Melanie Lawson&#x27;s father), and Reverend Kirbyjon Caldwell were among those presenting tributes to Zindler at the funeral. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Houston, Texas.

==Legacy==
The role of Melvin P. Thorpe, as played by Clinton Allmon in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; and Dom DeLuise in the 1982 film version, is based on Zindler.

In November 2007, Bellaire Park in Bellaire, Texas was renamed &quot;Bellaire Zindler Park.&quot;

<text>The Houston ThunderBears were a professional arena football team based in Houston, Texas. The team finished the 2001 season as a member of the Western Division of the American Conference of the Arena Football League (AFL). The team joined the AFL in 1996 as the expansion Texas Terror. After their first two years of existence, the franchise changed their name to the Houston ThunderBears. Plagued with attendance problems through the majority of their existence, the team folded in 2001. Home games were played at the Compaq Center.

The six seasons in which the team played coincided with the absence of the National Football League from the Houston market; the Houston Oilers had announced their departure from the city after the 1996 season, and the Houston Texans began play in 2002. Many of the same issues that led to the Oilers&#x27; departure, including poor attendance and a decline in the price of oil that drove Houston&#x27;s economy, also affected the Thunderbears.

==History==

===Texas Terror (1996–1997)===

The Texas Terror was a franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL). The Terror played in the 1996 and 1997 Arena seasons. Their home games were played at the Summit also at that time home to the Houston Rockets of the NBA. The Terror&#x27;s logo appeared to be a stylized representation of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster holding a football.

The 1996 season was an unmitigated disaster, with the Terror notching only one win, coming against another first-year team, the ill-fated Minnesota Fighting Pike. The 1997 season was considerably better with a record of 6-8, but the attendance was abysmal, especially given the size of the Houston market. After the season, the decision was made to remake the franchise and scrap both the existing logo and team name, and the team was renamed the Houston ThunderBears.

===Houston ThunderBears (1998–2001)===

The Houston ThunderBears were a continuation of the Texas Terror franchise (1996–1997) of the AFL under a new name, logo, and color scheme. The team still played its home games at the Compaq Center. 1998, the first year as the ThunderBears, was the high-water mark in team history, in which they recorded their only winning season and sole playoff appearance (a loss to Arizona). The two subsequent seasons saw a decline in both on-field performance and attendance. For the 2001 season, then owner Leslie Alexander (owner of the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets), sold the franchise back to the AFL. Although still called the &quot;Houston ThunderBears&quot;, the team played none of its home games in Houston. The league decided to use them as a showcase team to stimulate interest in new markets, playing in cities such as Bismarck, North Dakota, Madison, Wisconsin, and Charleston, West Virginia. Four AFL/af2 franchises (the Utah Blaze, Fresno Frenzy, Central Valley Coyotes, and Lubbock Renegades) emerged from some of the markets that the ThunderBears played in. The team was ultimately contracted along with three other AFL franchises in the 2001–2002 offseason.

<doc id="620709" wikidata="Q726392" url="?curid=620709" title="List of Linux distributions">
<text>This page provides general information about notable Linux distributions in the form of a categorized list. Distributions are organized into sections by the major distribution or package management system they are based on.

==Debian-based==
Debian (a portmanteau of the names &quot;Deb&quot; and &quot;Ian&quot;) Linux is a distribution that emphasizes free software. It supports many hardware platforms. Debian and distributions based on it use the .deb package format and the dpkg package manager and its frontends (such as apt or synaptic).

===Ubuntu-based===

Ubuntu (named after the Nguni philosophy of &quot;ubuntu&quot;) is a distribution based on Debian, designed to have regular releases, a consistent user experience and commercial support on both desktops and servers.

==== Current official derivatives ====
These Ubuntu variants, also known as Ubuntu flavours, simply install a set of packages different from the original Ubuntu, but since they draw additional packages and updates from the same repositories as Ubuntu, all of the same software is available for each of them.

==== Discontinued official derivatives ====
==== Unofficial derivatives ====
Unofficial variants and derivatives are not controlled or guided by Canonical Ltd. and generally have different goals in mind.
===Knoppix-based===

Knoppix (a portmanteau of the surname &quot;Knopper&quot; from Klaus Knopper and Unix) itself is based on Debian. It is a live distribution, with automated hardware configuration and a wide choice of software, which is decompressed as it loads from the drive.

== Pacman-based ==
Pacman is a package manager that is capable of resolving dependencies and automatically downloading and installing all necessary packages. It is primarily developed and used by Arch Linux and its derivatives.

=== Arch Linux-based ===
Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system—configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
=== Other Pacman-based ===
==RPM-based==
Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux were the original major distributions that used the .rpm file format, which today is used in several package management systems. Both of these were later divided into commercial and community-supported distributions. Red Hat Linux was divided into a community-supported but Red Hat-sponsored distribution named Fedora, and a commercially supported distribution called Red Hat Enterprise Linux, whereas SUSE Linux was divided into openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

===Fedora-based===

Fedora is a community supported distribution. It aims to provide the latest software while maintaining a completely Free Software system.

====RHEL-based====

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial open-source Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market.

===openSUSE-based===
openSUSE is a community-developed Linux distribution, sponsored by SUSE. It maintains a strict policy of ensuring all code in the standard installs will be from FOSS solutions, including Linux kernel Modules. SUSE&#x27;s enterprise Linux products are all based on the codebase that comes out of the openSUSE project.

===Mandriva-based===
Mandriva Linux is open-source distribution (with exceptions), discontinued in 2011. The first release was named Mandrake Linux and based on Red Hat Linux (version 5.1) and KDE 1 in July 1998. It had since moved away from Red Hat&#x27;s distribution and became a completely separate distribution. The name was changed to Mandriva, which included a number of original tools, mostly to ease system configuration. Mandriva Linux was the brainchild of Gaël Duval, who wanted to focus on ease of use for new users. The last stable version was in 2011. Mandriva&#x27;s developers moved to Mageia and OpenMandriva.
=== Other RPM-based ===
==Gentoo-based==

Gentoo is a distribution designed to have highly optimized and frequently updated software. Distributions based on Gentoo use the Portage package management system with emerge or one of the alternative package managers.

==Slackware-based==

Slackware is a highly customizable distribution that stresses ease of maintenance and reliability over cutting-edge software and automated tools. It is generally considered a distribution for advanced users.

== Android-based ==
Android is a mobile operating system bought and currently being developed by Google, based on a Google modified Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Despite Android&#x27;s core mobile focus, some laptop oriented derivatives like Android-x86 have come out over the years since its initial release.
==Source-based==
