<text>Thomas Simpson (30 November 1937 – 13 July 1967) was one of Britain&#x27;s most successful professional cyclists. He was born in Haswell, County Durham, and later moved to Harworth, Nottinghamshire. Simpson began road cycling as a teenager before taking up track cycling, specialising in pursuit races. He won a bronze medal for track cycling at the 1956 Summer Olympics and a silver at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

In 1959, at age 21, Simpson was signed by the French professional road-racing team . He advanced to their first team () the following year, and won the 1961 Tour of Flanders. Simpson then joined ; in the 1962 Tour de France he became the first British rider to wear the yellow jersey, finishing sixth overall.

In 1963 Simpson moved to , winning Bordeaux–Paris that year and the 1964 Milan–San Remo. In 1965 he became Britain&#x27;s first professional world road race champion and won the Giro di Lombardia; this made him the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the first cyclist to win the award. Injuries hampered much of Simpson&#x27;s 1966 season. He won two stages of the 1967 Vuelta a España before he won the general classification of Paris–Nice that year.

In the thirteenth stage of the 1967 Tour de France, Simpson collapsed and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many fans for his character and will to win.

==Early life and amateur career==

===Childhood and club racing===

Simpson was born on 30 November 1937 in Haswell, County Durham, the youngest of six children of coal miner Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (née Cheetham). His father had been a semi-professional sprinter in athletics. The family lived modestly in a small terraced house until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village&#x27;s working men&#x27;s club and lived above it. In 1950 the Simpsons moved to Harworth on the Nottinghamshire–Yorkshire border, where young Simpson&#x27;s maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry, by now, the only children left at home. Simpson rode his first bike, his brother-in-law&#x27;s, at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for time trials around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth &amp; District CC (Cycling Club) aged 13. He delivered groceries in the Bassetlaw district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better road bike. He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him &quot;four-stone Coppi&quot;, after Italian rider Fausto Coppi, due to his slim physique.

Simpson began winning club time trials, but sensed resentment of his boasting from senior members. He left Harworth &amp; District and joined Rotherham&#x27;s Scala Wheelers at the end of 1954. Simpson&#x27;s first road race was as a junior at the Forest Recreation Ground in Nottingham. After leaving school he was an apprentice draughtsman at an engineering company in Retford, using the commute by bike as training. He placed well in half mile races on grass and cement, but decided to concentrate on road racing. In May 1955 Simpson won the National Cyclists&#x27; Union South Yorkshire individual pursuit track event as a junior; the same year, he won the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) junior hill climb championship and placed third in the senior event.

Simpson immersed himself in the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a red light in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.

===Track years===

Berger told Simpson that if he wanted to be a successful road cyclist, he needed experience in track cycling, particularly in the pursuit discipline. Simpson competed regularly at Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist Cyril Cartwright, who helped him develop his technique. At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion Norman Sheil before losing to Mike Gambrill.

Simpson began working with his father as a draughtsman at the glass factory in Harworth. He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur world championships, he made the 4,000-metre team pursuit squad for the 1956 Olympics. In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in Eastern Europe against Russian and Italian teams to prepare for the Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began with races in Leningrad, continuing to Moscow before finishing in Sofia. He was nicknamed &quot;the Sparrow&quot; by the Soviet press because of his slender build. The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, where the team qualified for the team-pursuit semi-finals against Italy; they were confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss for pushing too hard on a turn and being unable to recover for the next.
After the Olympics, Simpson trained throughout his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode in the national 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working for a month and struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks&#x27; racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.

In September 1958, Simpson competed at the amateur world championships in Paris. Against reigning champion Carlo Simonigh of Italy in the opening round of the individual pursuit, he crashed on the concrete track at the end of the race. Simpson was briefly knocked unconscious and sustained a dislocated jaw; however, he won the race since he crashed after the finish line. Although he was in pain, team manager Benny Foster forced Simpson to race in the quarter-final against New Zealand&#x27;s Warwick Dalton, hoping to unsettle Dalton ahead of a possible meeting with Simpson&#x27;s teammate Sheil. Simpson wanted to turn professional, but needed to prove himself first, setting his sights on the world amateur indoor hour record. Reg Harris arranged for an attempt at Zürich&#x27;s Hallenstadion velodrome on Simpson&#x27;s birthday in November. He failed by 320 metres, covering a distance of and blaming his failure on the low temperature generated by an ice rink in the centre of the velodrome. The following week he travelled to Ghent, in the Flanders region of Belgium, to ride amateur track races. He stayed at the Café Den Engel, run by Albert Beurick, who organised for him to ride at Ghent&#x27;s Kuipke velodrome in the &quot;Sportpaleis&quot; (English: Sport Palace).

Simpson decided to move to the continent for a better chance at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. They agreed that he could stay with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.

===Move to Brittany===

In April 1959, Simpson left for France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in appreciation of his help promoting the company. His last words to his mother before the move were, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be sitting here in twenty years&#x27; time, wondering what would have happened if I hadn&#x27;t gone to France&quot;. The next day, his National Service papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.

He applied to local cycling clubs, and joined Club Olympique Briochin, racing with an independent (semi-professional) licence from the British Cycling Federation. When settled with the Murphy family, 21-year-old Simpson met 19-year-old Helen Sherburn, an au pair from Sutton, Yorkshire. Simpson began attracting attention, winning races and criteriums. He was invited to race in the eight-day stage race Route de France by the Saint-Raphaël VC 12e, the amateur club below the professional team . Simpson won the final stage, breaking away from the peloton and holding on for victory. After this win, he declined an offer to ride in the Tour de France for the professional team. Simpson had contract offers from two professional teams, and , which had a British cyclist, Brian Robinson; opting for the latter team, on 29 June he signed a contract for 80,000 francs (£80 a month).

On Simpson&#x27;s return to Harworth for Christmas, the RAF were notified and the press ran stories on his apparent draft avoidance. He passed a medical in Sheffield, but history repeated itself and the papers arrived the day after his departure for his team&#x27;s training camp in Narbonne in southern France. The French press, unlike the British, found the situation amusing.

==Professional career==

===1959: Foundations===
In July, four months after leaving England, Simpson rode his first race as a professional, the Tour de l&#x27;Ouest in west France. He won the fourth stage and took the overall race leader&#x27;s jersey. He won the next stage&#x27;s individual time trial, increasing his lead. On the next stage he lost the lead with a punctured tyre, finishing the race in fourteenth place overall.
In August Simpson competed at the world championships in the 5000 m individual pursuit at Amsterdam&#x27;s large, open-air velodrome and the road race on the nearby Circuit Park Zandvoort motor-racing track. He placed fourth in the individual pursuit, losing by 0.3 seconds in the quarter-finals. He prepared for the road race, eight laps of the track. After a ten-rider breakaway formed; Simpson bridged the gap. As the peloton began to close in, he tried to attack. Although he was brought back each time, Simpson placed fourth in a sprint for the best finish to date by a British rider. He was praised by the winner, André Darrigade of France, who thought that without Simpson&#x27;s work on the front, the breakaway would have been caught. Darrigade helped him enter criteriums for extra money. His fourth place earned Simpson his nickname, &quot;Major Simpson&quot;, from French sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. They ran the headline: &quot;Les carnets du Major Simpson&quot; (&quot;The notes of Major Simpson&quot;), referencing the 1950s series of books, &quot;Les carnets du Major Thompson&quot; by Pierre Daninos.

Simpson moved up to &#x27;s first team, , for the end-of-season one-day classic races. In his first appearance in the Giro di Lombardia, one of the five &quot;monuments&quot; of cycling, he retired with a tyre puncture while in the lead group of riders. In Simpson&#x27;s last race of the season, he finished fourth in the Trofeo Baracchi, a two-man team time trial with Gérard Saint, racing against his boyhood idol, Fausto Coppi; it was Coppi&#x27;s final race before his death. Simpson finished the season with twenty-eight wins.

===1960: Tour de France debut===
His first major race of the 1960 season was the one-day &quot;monument&quot; Milan–San Remo in March, in which the organisers introduced the Poggio climb (the final climb) to keep the race from finishing with a bunch sprint. Simpson broke clear from a breakaway group over the first climb, the Turchino, leading the race for before being caught. He lost contact over the Poggio, finishing in 38th place. In April he moved to the Porte de Clichy district of Paris, sharing a small apartment with his teammate Robinson.

Days after his move, Simpson rode in Paris–Roubaix, known as &quot;The Hell of the North&quot;, the first cycling race to be shown live on Eurovision. He launched an attack as an early breakaway, riding alone at the front for , but was caught around a mile from the finish at Roubaix Velodrome, coming in ninth. Simpson rode a lap of honour after the race at the request of the emotional crowd. His televised effort gained him attention throughout Europe. He then won the Mont Faron hill climb and the overall general classification of the Tour du Sud-Est, his first overall win in a professional stage race. He planned to ride in the Isle of Man International road race, excited to see to his home fans. There were rumours, which proved correct, that the Royal Military Police were waiting for him at the airport, so he decided not to travel. This was the last he heard from the authorities regarding his call-up. The British Cycling Federation fined him £25 for his absence.
In June, Simpson made his Grand Tour debut in the Tour de France aged 22. Rapha &quot;directeur sportif&quot; (team manager) Raymond Louviot opposed his participation, but since the race was contested by national teams Simpson accepted the invitation from the British squad. During the first stage, he was part of a thirteen-rider breakaway which finished over two minutes in front of the field; he crashed on the cinder track at Heysel Stadium in Brussels, finishing thirteenth, but received the same time as the winner. Later that day he finished ninth in the time trial, moving up to fifth place overall. During the third stage Simpson was part of a breakaway with two French riders who repeatedly attacked him, forcing him to chase and use energy needed for the finish; he finished third, missing the thirty-second bonus for a first-place finish, which would have put him in the overall race leader&#x27;s yellow jersey. He dropped to ninth overall by the end of the first week. During stage ten, Simpson crashed descending the Col d&#x27;Aubisque in the Pyrenees but finished the stage in fourteenth place. In the following stage he was dropped, exhausted, from a chasing group; failing to recover. He finished the Tour in twenty-ninth place overall, losing in weight over the three weeks.

After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until crashing in central France; he returned home to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week&#x27;s bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes on the right side of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.

===1961: Tour of Flanders and injury===
Simpson&#x27;s first major event of the 1961 season was the Paris–Nice stage race in March. In stage three he helped his team win the team time trial and took the general classification lead by three seconds; however, he lost it in the next stage. In the final stages of the race Simpson&#x27;s attacks were thwarted, and he finished fifth overall.
On 26 March, Simpson rode in the one-day Tour of Flanders. With &#x27;s Nino Defilippis, he chased down an early breakaway. Simpson worked with the group; with about to go he attacked, followed by Defilippis. The finish, three circuits around the town of Wetteren, was flat; Defilippis, unlike Simpson, was a sprinter and was expected to win. One kilometre from the finish, Simpson launched a sprint; he eased off with 300 m to go, tricking Defilippis into thinking he was exhausted. As Defilippis passed, Simpson jumped again to take victory, becoming the first Briton to win a &quot;monument&quot; classic. Defilippis protested that the finishing banner had been blown down, and he did not know where the finish was; however, the judges noted that the finish line was clearly marked on the road itself. Defilippis&#x27; team asked Simpson to agree to a tie, saying no Italian had won a classic since 1953. He replied: &quot;An Englishman had not won one since 1896!&quot;

A week later, Simpson rode in Paris–Roubaix in the hope of bettering his previous year&#x27;s ninth place. As the race reached the paved section he went on a solo attack, at which point he was told that rider Raymond Poulidor was chasing him down. Simpson increased his speed, catching the publicity and press vehicles ahead (known as the &quot;caravane&quot;). A press car swerved to avoid a pothole; this forced him into a roadside ditch. Simpson fell, damaging his front wheel and injuring his knee. He found his team car and collected a replacement wheel, but by then the front of the race had passed. Back in the race he crashed twice more, finishing 88th.

At Simpson&#x27;s next race, the four-day Grand Prix d&#x27;Eibar, his first in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but was forced to quit during the following stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons he was forced to enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.

Helen became pregnant; Simpson&#x27;s apartment in Paris was now unsuitable and a larger home in France was not in their means. In October, with help from his friend, Albert Beurick, they moved into a small cottage in Ghent. Low on funds, Simpson earned money in one-day track races in Belgium.

===1962: Yellow jersey===
Simpson&#x27;s contract with Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop had ended with the 1961 season. Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil signed with them for 1962, but Simpson wanted to lead a team, and signed with for the 1962 season. After training camp at Lodève in southern France, he rode in Paris–Nice. He helped his team win the stage-3a team time trial and finished second overall, behind &#x27;s Jef Planckaert. He was unable to ride in Milan–San Remo when its organisers limited the race to Italian-based teams; instead he rode in Gent–Wevelgem, finishing sixth, then defended his Tour of Flanders title. At the end of the latter, Simpson was in a select group of riders at the head of the race. Although he led over each of the final climbs, at the finish he finished fifth and won the King of the Mountains prize. A week later Simpson finished thirty-seventh in Paris–Roubaix, delayed by a crash.
Coming into the Tour de France, Simpson was leader of his team; it was the first time since 1929 that company teams were allowed to compete. He finished ninth in the first stage, in a group of twenty-two riders who finished over eight minutes ahead of the rest. Simpson&#x27;s team finished second to in the stage-2b team time trial; he was in seventh place in the general classification, remaining in the top ten the rest of the first week. During stage 8a he was in a thirty-rider group which gained about six minutes, moving him to second overall behind teammate André Darrigade. At the end of the eleventh stage Simpson was third in the overall, over a minute behind race leader Willy Schroeders () and fifty-one seconds behind Darrigade. Stage twelve from Pau to Saint-Gaudens, the hardest stage of the 1962 Tour (known as the &quot;Circle of Death&quot;), was the Tour&#x27;s first mountain stage. Simpson saw an opportunity to lead the race. The team now solely concentrated on his interests, since Darrigade was a sprinter and would no longer be involved in the general classification. As the peloton reached the Col du Tourmalet, Simpson attacked with a small group of select riders, finishing eighteenth place in a bunch sprint. As he finished ahead of all the other leaders in the general classification, he became the overall new leader of race, and the first British rider to wear the leader&#x27;s yellow jersey. Simpson lost the lead on the following stage, a short time trial ending with a steep uphill finish at Superbagnères. He finished thirty-first and dropped to sixth overall. On stage nineteen he advanced recklessly descending the Col de Porte in the Alps, crashing on a bend and only saved from falling over the edge by a tree, leaving him with a broken left middle finger. He lost almost eleven minutes in the next stage&#x27;s time trial, finishing the Tour at Paris&#x27; Parc des Princes stadium 17 minutes and 9 seconds behind in 6th place.

After the Tour Simpson rode criteriums before the road world championships in Salò, Italy, where he retired after missing a large breakaway. He began riding six-day track races into his winter break. In December he made an appearance at the Champions&#x27; Concert cycling awards held at Royal Albert Hall in London. Separately, he won the British Cycling Federation&#x27;s Personality of the Year. Simpson and Helen were expecting their second child and upgraded to a larger house in Sint-Amandsberg, a sub-municipality of Ghent.

===1963: Bordeaux–Paris===
Leroux withdrew its sponsorship of the Gitane team for the 1963 season. Simpson was contracted to their manager, Raymond Louviot; Louviot was rejoining and Simpson could follow, but he saw that as a step backwards. bought the contract from Louviot, which ran until the end of the season. Simpson&#x27;s season opened with Paris–Nice; he fell out of contention after a series of tyre punctures in the opening stages, using the rest of the race as training. He withdrew from the race on the final stage to rest for his next race, Milan–San Remo; after breaking away by himself he stopped beside the road, which annoyed his fellow riders. At Milan–San Remo, Simpson was in a four-rider breakaway; his tyre punctured, and although he got back to the front, he finished nineteenth. He placed third in the Tour of Flanders in a three-rider sprint. In Paris–Roubaix Simpson worked for teammate, and winner, Emile Daems, finishing ninth. In the one-day Paris–Brussels he was in a breakaway near the Belgian border; with remaining he was left with world road race champion Jean Stablinski of , who attacked on a cobbled climb in Alsemberg outside Brussels. Simpson&#x27;s bike slipped a gear, and Stablinski stayed away for the victory. After his second-place finish, Simpson led the Super Prestige Pernod International season-long competition for world&#x27;s best cyclist. The following week he raced in the Ardennes classics, placing thirty-third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, after he rode alone for about before being caught in the closing kilometres.
On 26 May, Simpson rode in the one-day, Bordeaux–Paris. Also known as the &quot;Derby of the Road&quot;, it was the longest he had ever ridden. The race began at 1:58 am; the initial were unpaced until the town of Châtellerault, where dernys (motorised bicycles) paced each rider to the finish. Simpson broke away in a group of three riders. Simpson&#x27;s pacer, Fernand Wambst, increased his speed, and Simpson dropped the other two. He caught the lead group, thirteen minutes ahead, over a distance of . Simpson attacked, and with remaining, opening a margin of two minutes. His lead steadily increased, and he finished in the Parc des Princes over five minutes ahead of teammate Piet Rentmeester.

Simpson announced that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Shay Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished in a bunch sprint, with Simpson crossing the line in 29th. Simpson&#x27;s season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, along with other European riders. He skipped his usual winter training schedule for his first skiing holiday at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in the Alps, taking Helen and his two young daughters, Jane and Joanne.

===1964: Milan–San Remo===
After a training camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in Belgium, finishing second to &#x27;s Arthur Decabooter. The conditions were so cold, he only completed the race to keep warm. Albert Beurick started Simpson&#x27;s supporters club at the Café Den Engel, raising £250 for him in the first nine months. In Paris–Nice, his tyre punctured during stage four, losing five minutes and used the rest of the race for training.
On 19 March, two days later, Simpson rode in Milan–San Remo. Before the race, French journalist René de Latour advised Simpson not to attack early: &quot;If you feel good then keep it for the last hour of the race.&quot; In the final , Simpson escaped in a group of four riders, which included the 1961 winner, Poulidor of . On final climb, the Poggio, Poulidor launched a series of attacks on the group; only Simpson managed to stay with him and they crossed the summit and descended into San Remo. With 500 m to go, Simpson began his sprint; Poulidor could not respond, leaving Simpson to take the victory with a record average speed of .

Simpson spent the next two months training for the Tour de France at the end of June. After the first week of the Tour, Simpson was in tenth place overall. On the ninth stage, he was part of 22-rider breakaway which finished together at Monaco&#x27;s Stade Louis II; he placed second to Anquetil, moving up to eighth overall. The next day, he finished 20th in the time trial. During the 16th stage, which crossed four cols, Simpson finished 33rd, 25 minutes and 10 seconds behind the stage winner, and dropped to 17th overall. He finished the Tour in 14th place overall. Simpson later discovered that he rode the Tour suffering from tapeworms.

After the race, Simpson prepared for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He got back to the peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia. Halfway through the race he was given the wrong &quot;musette&quot; (bag) by his team in the feed zone, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, Molteni&#x27;s Gianni Motta attacked. Simpson was the only one who could follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained him for a while. On the final climb Simpson led Motta, but was exhausted. Over the remaining of flat terrain, Motta dropped him; Simpson cracked, and was repeatedly overtaken, finishing twenty-first. He closed the year riding track races.

===1965: World championship and Lombardia===
The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, before a trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, suffering a broken foot and a sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out on the fourth day with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo at the foot of the Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled to walk on his injured foot. In Liège–Bastogne–Liège he attacked with &#x27;s Felice Gimondi, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up. Simpson rode alone before slipping on oil mixed with water; he stayed with the front group, finishing tenth.

On 29 May, Simpson rode in the London–Holyhead race, the longest unpaced one-day race, with a distance of ; he won in a bunch sprint, setting a record of ten hours and twenty-nine minutes. He followed with an appearance at Bordeaux–Paris. François Mahé () went on a lone break, Simpson attacked in pursuit, followed by Jean Stablinski. Simpson&#x27;s derny broke down, and he was delayed changing motorbikes. He caught Stablinski, and was joined by Anquetil. Outside Paris Mahé was caught and dropped, after on his own. Anquetil won the race by fifty-seven seconds ahead of Stablinski, who beat Simpson in a sprint. Peugeot manager Gaston Plaud ordered Simpson to ride the Midi Libre stage race to earn a place in the Tour de France, and he finished third overall. The 1965 Tour was considered open due to Anquetil&#x27;s absence, and Simpson was among the riders favoured by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. During stage nine he injured his hand crashing on the descent of the Col d&#x27;Aubisque in the Pyrenees, finishing tenth in the stage and seventh in general classification. Simpson developed bronchitis after stage fifteen and cracked on the next stage, losing nearly nineteen minutes. His hand became infected, but he rode the next three stages before the Tour doctor stopped him from racing. He was taken to hospital, where they operated on his hand and treated him for blood poisoning, bronchitis and a kidney infection.
After ten days off his bike, Simpson was only contracted to three post-Tour criteriums. His training for the road world championships included kermesse circuit races in Flanders. Simpson&#x27;s last race before the world championships was the Paris–Luxembourg stage race, riding as a super-&quot;domestique&quot; (lieutenant). On 5 September, Simpson rode in the road race at the world championships in San Sebastián, Spain. The race was a hilly circuit of fourteen laps. The British team had no support; Simpson and his friend Albert Beurick obtained food and drink by stealing from other teams. During the first lap, a strong break was begun by British rider Barry Hoban. As his lead stretched to one minute, Simpson and teammates Vin Denson and Alan Ramsbottom bridged the gap, followed by Germany&#x27;s Rudi Altig. Hoban kept the pace high enough to prevent any of the favourites from joining. Simpson and Altig broke clear with two-and-a-half laps remaining, staying together until the final kilometre, when Simpson launched his sprint; he held off Altig for victory by three bike lengths, becoming the first British professional world road race champion.

On 16 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia, which featured five mountain passes. He escaped with Motta, and dropped him before the finish in Como to win his third &quot;monument&quot; classic over three minutes ahead of the rest. Simpson was the second world champion to win in Italy; the first was Alfredo Binda in 1927. Simpson was offered lucrative contracts by teams, including who were prepared to pay him the year&#x27;s salary in advance. He could not escape his contract with Peugeot, which ran until the end of the 1967 season. For the next three weeks he rode contract races, riding an estimated . He rode 18 races, with each earning him £300–£350.

Simpson ended the year second to Anquetil in the Super Prestige Pernod International, and won the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Sportsman of the Year, the Sports Journalists&#x27; Association Sportsman of the Year, presented by the Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. In British cycling Simpson won the British Cycling Federation Personality of the Year and the Bidlake Memorial Prize. He was given the freedom of Sint-Amandsberg; his family, including his parents, were driven in an open-top car along the crowd-lined route from the Café Den Engel to the Town Hall.
===1966: An injury-ridden season===
As in the previous winter, Simpson went on a skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, breaking his right tibia, and his leg was in a plaster cast until the end of February. He missed contract races, crucial training and most of the spring classics. Simpson began riding again in March, and in late April started, but did not finish, Liège–Bastogne–Liège.
Simpson&#x27;s injury did not stop the press from naming him a favourite for the Tour de France. He was subdued in the race until stage twelve, when he forced a breakaway with Altig (Molteni), finishing second. Simpson again finished second in the next stage, jumping clear of the peloton in a three-rider group in the final kilometres. After the stage he was eighteenth overall, over seven minutes down. Simpson moved up to 16th after finishing 5th in stage 14b – a short time trial. As the race reached the Alps, he decided to make his move. During stage sixteen he attacked on the descent of the first of three cols, the Croix de Fer. He crashed but continued, attacking again. Simpson was joined by &#x27;s Julio Jiménez on the climb of the Télégraphe to the Galibier. Simpson was caught by a chase group descending the Galibier before he crashed again, knocked off his bike by a press motorcycle. The crash required five stitches in his arm. The next day he struggled to hold the handlebars and could not use the brake lever with his injured arm, forcing him to abandon. His answer to journalists asking about his future was, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m heartbroken. My season is ruined.&quot;

After recovering from his injury Simpson rode 40 criteriums in 40 days, capitalising on his world championship and his attacks in the Tour. He retired from the road world championships at the Nürburgring with cramp. His road season ended with retirements from autumn classics Paris–Tours and the Giro di Lombardia. He rode six-day races, finishing fourteenth in the winter rankings. The misfortune he endured during the season made him the first rider named as a victim of the &quot;curse of the rainbow jersey&quot;. For the winter Simpson took his family to the island of Corsica, planning the build of his retirement home.

===1967: Paris–Nice and Vuelta stages===
Simpson&#x27;s primary objective for 1967 was overall victory in the Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which – although one of the weakest – would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson&#x27;s previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with &quot;Cycling&quot; (now Cycling Weekly) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track and spend more time with his family.
In March he rode in the Paris–Nice. After stage two his teammate, Eddy Merckx, took the overall lead. Simpson moved into the lead the next day as part of a breakaway, missed by Merckx, which finished nearly twenty minutes ahead. Merckx thought Simpson double-crossed him, but Simpson was a passive member of the break. At the start of stage six, Simpson was in second place behind &#x27;s Rolf Wolfshohl. Merckx drew clear as the race approached Mont Faron, with Simpson following. They stayed together until the finish in Hyères, with Simpson allowing Merckx to take first place. Simpson finished over a minute ahead of Wolfshohl, putting him in the race leader&#x27;s white jersey. He held the lead in the next two stages to win the race. Three days later Simpson and Merckx both raced in Milan–San Remo. Simpson escaped early in a five-rider breakaway lasting about , before Merckx won in a bunch sprint with assistance from Simpson, who finished in seventieth place. After of Paris–Roubaix, Simpson&#x27;s bike was unridable and he retired from the race.

In late April Simpson rode in his first Vuelta a España, using the eighteen-stage race to prepare for the Tour. During stage two a breakaway group gained over thirteen minutes, dashing his hopes for a high placing. Simpson nearly quit the race before the fifth stage, from Salamanca to Madrid, but rode it because it was easier to get home by air from Madrid. He won the stage, attacking from a breakaway, and finished second in stage seven. On the eleventh stage, concluding in Andorra, Simpson rode away from the peloton on his own. With remaining, he began to lose control of his bike and was halted by Peugeot manager Gaston Plaud until he had recovered, by which time the race had passed. In an interview with &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;&#x27;s Philippe Brunel in February 2000, Tour de France physician Pierre Dumas revealed that Simpson told him that he was taken to hospital during the Vuelta. Simpson won stage sixteen, which ended in San Sebastián, and finished the Vuelta thirty-third overall.

Simpson was determined to make an impact in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement. His plan was to finish in the top three, or to wear the yellow jersey at some point in the race. He targeted three key stages, one of which was the thirteenth, over Mont Ventoux, and planned to ride conservatively until the race reached the mountains. In the prologue, Simpson finished thirteenth. After the first week he was in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. Unable to eat, he finished stage ten in 16th place and dropped to seventh overall as his rivals passed him. Teammate Vin Denson advised Simpson to limit his losses and accept what he had. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on stage 12. In Marseille, on the evening before stage thirteen, Simpson&#x27;s manager, Daniel Dousset, pressured him for good results. Plaud begged Simpson to quit the race.
==Death==
The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France measured ; it started in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the &quot;Giant of Provence&quot;) before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn, Tour doctor Pierre Dumas met journalist Pierre Chany near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature, &quot;If the boys stick their nose in a &#x27;topette&#x27; [bag of drugs] today, we could have a death on our hands.&quot; At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson looked tired and asked him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, &quot;No, it&#x27;s not the heat, it&#x27;s the Tour.&quot;

As the race reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson&#x27;s team mechanic Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid back on his water bottle as he exited a building. Race &quot;commissaire&quot; (official) Jacques Lohmuller later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back to a group of chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: &quot;Come on Tom, that&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s your Tour finished&quot;, but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, &quot;If Tom wants to go on, he goes&quot;. Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, &quot;Me straps, Harry, me straps!&quot; They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson&#x27;s last words, as remembered by Hall, were &quot;On, on, on.&quot; Hall estimated Simpson rode a further before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked on the handlebars. Hall and a nurse from the Tour&#x27;s medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40 p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of amphetamines, one of which was labelled &quot;Tonedron&quot;, were found in the rear pocket of his jersey. The official cause of death was &quot;heart failure caused by exhaustion.&quot;
On the next racing day, the other riders were reluctant to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. France&#x27;s Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Hoban won the stage, although many thought the stage winner should have been Denson, Simpson&#x27;s close friend. Media reports suggested that his death was caused by heat exhaustion, until, on 31 July 1967 British journalist J. L. Manning of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson&#x27;s death. French authorities confirmed that Simpson had traces of amphetamine in his body, impairing his judgement and allowing him to push himself beyond his limits. His death contributed to the introduction of mandatory testing for performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, leading to tests in 1968 at the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Tour de France and Summer Olympics. Simpson was buried in Harworth Cemetery, after a service at the 12th-century village church attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners, including Peugeot teammate Eddy Merckx, the only continental rider in attendance. The epitaph on Simpson&#x27;s gravestone in Harworth cemetery reads, &quot;His body ached, his legs grew tired, but still he would not give in&quot;, taken from a card left by his brother, Harry, following his death.

==Doping==
Unlike the majority of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by Chris Brasher for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: &quot;I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don&#x27;t want to have to take it – I have too much respect for my body.&quot; Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, &quot;The People&quot;, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.

In his biography of Simpson, &quot;Put Me Back on My Bike&quot;, William Fotheringham quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, &quot;Tom went on the [1967] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things&quot;, which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson&#x27;s roommate Colin Lewis. Ramsbottom added, &quot;Tom took a lot of chances. He took a lot of it [drugs]. I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days.&quot; although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: &quot;That&#x27;s my year&#x27;s supply of Micky Finns&#x27;. That lot cost me £800.&quot;

Commentator and Simpson&#x27;s close friend David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, &quot;Cycling in the Sixties&quot;, that although he did not condone Simpson&#x27;s use of drugs, he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: &quot;I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself because he just did not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all.&quot; Saunders went on to say that Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because &quot;he was not going to be beaten by a pill&quot;.

==Riding style and legacy==
Simpson in his adolescence was described as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, he would come back on the descent. Simpson&#x27;s risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: &quot;When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes ride up the advertising boards at the top of the bankings, Wall of Death-style, to please the crowds.&quot; Simpson&#x27;s death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a near-death experience during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: &quot;He said he felt peace of mind and wasn&#x27;t afraid to die. He said he would have been happy dying.&quot;

Simpson looked for any advantage over his opponents. He made his own saddle, a design which is now standard. During his time with Peugeot, he rode bikes made by Italian manufacturer Masi that resembled Peugeots. Simpson was obsessed with dieting since 1956, when he was mentored by Cyril Cartwright. Simpson understood the value of fruit and vegetables after reading &quot;Les Cures de jus&quot; by nutritionist Raymond Dextreit; during the winter, he would consume of carrots a day. Other unusual food preferences included pigeons, duck and trout skin, raspberry leaves and garlic in large quantities.

In the 1968 Tour de France, there was a special prize given in his honour, the Souvenir Tom Simpson, a sprint on stage 15 in the small town of Mirepoix, won by the soloing Roger Pingeon. Winner of the race Jan Janssen said of him, &quot;Occasionally Tommy could be annoying. When it was rolling along at 30kmh and - paf!… he’d attack. Oh leave us alone! There&#x27;s still 150km to go pipe down. But often, he wanted war.&quot; Janssen went on to say, &quot;Even in the feed zones. It&#x27;s not the law, but it&#x27;s not polite. Musettes (lunch bags) were up in the air there was panic and crashes. It was Simpson acting like a jerk. It didn&#x27;t happen often. Occasionally I was angry at him. I’d say to him in his native English: You f*****g c**t... There were often many teams, five or six, in the same hotel together every evening. Each had their own table. And at a certain moment, Tommy walked into the restaurant like a gentleman, with a cane, bowler hat and in costume… He was like a Lord in England and the rest of us were in tracksuits. Everyone saw that, laughed, and the things he had done during the race were forgotten.&quot;
A granite memorial to Simpson, with the words &quot;Olympic medallist, world champion, British sporting ambassador&quot;, stands on the spot where he collapsed and died on Ventoux, one kilometre east of the summit. &quot;Cycling&quot; began a fund for a monument a week after Simpson&#x27;s death, raising about £1,500. The memorial was unveiled in 1968. It has become a site of pilgrimage for cyclists, who frequently leave cycling-related objects, such as water bottles and caps, in tribute. In nearby Bédoin, a plaque was installed in the town square by journalists following the 1967 Tour. The Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club has a small museum dedicated to Simpson, opened by Belgian cyclist Lucien Van Impe in August 2001. In 1997, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, a small plaque was added to the Mont Ventoux memorial, with the words &quot;There is no mountain too high. Your daughters Jane and Joanne, July 13, 1997&quot;, and a replica of the memorial was erected outside the museum. In his adopted hometown of Ghent, there is a bust of Simpson at the entrance to the Kuipke velodrome. Every year since his death, the Tom Simpson Memorial Race has taken place in Harworth.

Ray Pascoe, a fan, made the 1995 film &quot;Something To Aim At&quot;, a project he began in the years following Simpson&#x27;s death; the film includes interviews with those closest to Simpson. The 2005 documentary &quot;Wheels Within Wheels&quot; follows actor Simon Dutton as he searches for people and places in Simpson&#x27;s life. Dutton&#x27;s four-year project chronicles the midlife crisis that sparked his quest to rediscover Simpson. British rider David Millar won stage twelve of the 2012 Tour de France on the 45th anniversary of Simpson&#x27;s death; previously banned from cycling for using performance-enhancing drugs, he paid tribute to Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his – and Simpson&#x27;s – mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Cycling Is My Life&quot;, published in 2009. In 2010, Simpson was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. He inspired &quot;Simpson Magazine&quot;, which began in March 2013. According to the magazine&#x27;s creators, “It was Simpson&#x27;s spirit and style, his legendary tenacity and his ability to suffer that endeared him to cycling fans everywhere as much as the trophies he won.”

==Family and interests==
Soon after moving to France in 1959, Simpson met Helen Sherburn. They married in 1961, before moving to Ghent, Belgium, the following year. They had two daughters, Jane (born April 1962) and Joanne (born May 1963), who were brought up, and live, in Belgium. After his death, Helen Simpson married Barry Hoban in December 1969. Simpson is the maternal uncle of retired Belgian-Australian cyclist Matthew Gilmore, whose father, Graeme, was also a cyclist. The 2000 book &quot;Mr. Tom: The True Story of Tom Simpson&quot;, written by Simpson&#x27;s nephew, Chris Sidwells, focuses on his career and family life.

Simpson spoke fluent French, and was also competent in Flemish and Italian. He was interested in vintage cars, and his driving and riding styles were similar; Helen remembered, &quot;Driving through the West End of London at , was nothing.&quot; In January 1966, Simpson was a guest castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;; his favourite musical piece was &quot;Ari&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Exodus&quot; by the London Festival Orchestra, his book choice was &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; and his luxury item was golf equipment. Helen said that she chose his records for the show, since he was not interested in music. Simpson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Cycling Is My Life&quot;, was first published in 1966.

<text>The Last Tour on Earth is a live album comprising recordings from Marilyn Manson&#x27;s Mechanical Animals Tour, Beautiful Monsters Tour and Rock is Dead Tour, released on November 12, 1999. On the studio version of &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, Manson says that drugs &quot;are made in California&quot;, but in the live version, he says that &quot;drugs, they say, are made right here in Cleveland&quot;, to a roar of crowd approval, suggesting that the song was recorded in Cleveland, Ohio. &quot;Lunchbox&quot; was recorded in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot; was recorded in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. &quot;The Last Day on Earth&quot; was recorded in Las Vegas on the Mechanical Animals Tour, and &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; was recorded some time during the Rock is Dead Tour.

&quot;Rock is Dead&quot; is introduced as if Omega and the Mechanical Animals, the alter-egos Manson and his band devised for the Mechanical Animals album and tour, were playing. Some of the tracks, most notably &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot;, are prefaced with spoken diatribes.

The album includes one new studio track, &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes&quot;, which also appears on the &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; soundtrack. A promotional single was released for Celebrity Deathmatch but never commercially released. 

Although extensive amounts of performance footage was captured (partially shown In The 40 minute documentary &quot;God Is in the T.V.&quot;) a live DVD of this tour did not materialize.

<doc id="623015" wikidata="Q7285023" url="?curid=623015" title="Rainy Season (short story)">
<text>&quot;Rainy Season&quot; is a short horror story by Stephen King, first published in &quot;Midnight Graffiti&quot; in 1989, and later collected in King&#x27;s book &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; in 1993.

== Plot summary ==
A young husband and wife on summer vacation rent a house in a small town called Willow, Maine, only to be warned repeatedly (if vaguely) to leave by the local inhabitants. They do not comply and, having purchased groceries, return to the house. They learn the price for prosperity the citizens of Willow must pay: every seven years a husband and wife will go there from outside and will stay, despite protests, to become sacrifices during the rainy season. When the &quot;rain&quot; starts, the couple learns the nature of the precipitation: an army of grotesque black toads the size of footballs, armed with needle-sharp teeth and able to chew through doors and walls. After the carnage, the toads melt away into poisonous sludge that is washed away easily. Two residents debate the price that is paid for their prosperity, but decide there is nothing they can do about it.

== Publication ==
The writing of &quot;Rainy Season&quot; ended a bout of writer&#x27;s block from which King had been suffering. The story was first published in issue 3 of the magazine &quot;Midnight Graffiti&quot; in spring 1989. In 1993, it was republished in King&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; collection. In 2006, a version of the story illustrated by Glenn Chadbourne was published as part of the Cemetery Dance Publications book &quot;The Secretary of Dreams, Volume One&quot;. The audiobook version of this story was narrated by actress Yeardley Smith. 

== Reception ==
Wiater et al. compared it to Shirley Jackson&#x27;s short story &quot;The Lottery&quot;, an idea reinforced by the fact that one of the story&#x27;s characters directly references Jackson&#x27;s story at one point. Writing at Tor.com, Grady Hendrix called it a &quot;time passer&quot; that was likely expanded from a single surreal image.

==Adaptations ==
&quot;Rainy Season&quot; was adapted into a 2017 short film of the same name, written and directed by Vanessa Ionta Wright and produced by Above the Line Artistry.

In 2019, the story was again adapted, this time by Patrick Haischberger, and starring Thomas Stipsits, Sabrina Reiter, Inge Maux, Fritz Karl and Wolfgang Hübsch.

<doc id="623017" wikidata="Q475650" url="?curid=623017" title="José Luis Cuevas">
<text>José Luis Cuevas (February 26, 1934 – July 3, 2017) was a Mexican artist, he often worked as a painter, writer, draftsman, engraver, illustrator, and printmaker. Cuevas was one of the first to challenge the then dominant Mexican muralism movement as a prominent member of the Generación de la Ruptura (English: Breakaway Generation). He was a mostly self-taught artist, whose styles and influences are moored to the darker side of life, often depicting distorted figures and the debasement of humanity. He had remained a controversial figure throughout his career, not only for his often shocking images, but also for his opposition to writers and artists who he feels participate in corruption or create only for money. In 1992, the José Luis Cuevas Museum was opened in the historic center of Mexico City holding most of his work and his personal art collection. His grandson Alexis de Chaunac is a contemporary artist.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
José Luis Cuevas was born on February 26, 1934, to a middle-class family in Mexico City. He was born on the upper floor of the paper and pencil factory belonging to his paternal grandfather, Adalberto Cuevas.

When he was ten years old, he began studies at the National School of Painting and Sculpture &quot;La Esmeralda&quot;, and he also started to illustrate newspapers and books. However, he was forced to abandon his studies in 1946 when he contracted rheumatic fever. The illness left him bedridden for two years. During this time, he learned engraving work taught by Lola Cueto of Mexico City College.

===Early career===
At age fourteen, he rented a space on Donceles street to use as a studio instead of returning to school as his poor health meant that did not know how long he might live. He decided it would be better to dedicate himself to his art. Cuevas learned how to horse back ride and basket weave for money. He worked on illustrations for &quot;The News&quot;, and despite his lack of formal training, he taught art history classes at Coronet Hall Institute. One element of his training was the opportunity to visit the La Castaneda mental hospital where his brother worked to draw the patients.

=== Generación de la Ruptura ===
Cuevas was sometimes described as vain, a pathological liar and a hypochondriac, obsessed with sickness and death, especially his own. Writer René Avilés Fabila once said that “The greatest love of José Luis Cuevas is named José Luis Cuevas, because he is an artist more in love with himself than with his work.” The reason for this quote is that he has done so many self-portraits that it is like having a large number of mirrors. Cuevas stated that he did not believe that he was vain and says that idea started in 1955 when he decided to take a picture of himself every day, which he continued to do up to the end of his life. He was one of the most photographed contemporary artists of Mexico. One ludicrous story states that he visited a “vampire brothel” where they scratch and paw at customers. Other story relates him to a 70-year-old woman named Gloria who he tried to seduce and another one that Marlene Dietrich threw herself at him. He admitted to being a bit paranoid and defensive, concerned about being cast in a negative light. He claimed Julio Scherer García as an enemy for interfering with his writing career. He also had feuds with painter Rufino Tamayo. He claimed that José Chávez Morado, Guillermo González Camarena and the &quot;Frente Popular de Artes Plasticas&quot; were envious of him and that they accused him of working with the CIA in the 1950s when he was coming out after mainstream artists. Even in his final years, he made deferences by opening his museum to all of his friends but those he considers enemies were not permitted inside.

In the 1960s, he went to Morocco to study Islamic art, meeting painter Francis Bacon in Tangiers. He became an atheist after the death of his mother in the 1970s. From 1976 to 1979, he “self-exiled”, leaving Mexico for France, working on various books, serigraphs and lithographs for publication. When he returned to Mexico, he presented the exhibition “José Luis Cuevas. El regreso de otro hijo pródigo.” (José Luis Cuevas. The return of another prodigal son).

Despite his predictions that he would live to over a hundred because various tarot readings had told him so,
Cuevas died on July 3, 2017, in Mexico City at the age of 83.

==Marriage==
Cuevas married his first wife, Bertha Riestra, in 1961. He met Bertha at the La Castaneda hospital while she was there doing community service and painting. Her parents did not attend the wedding as they did not approve of him since he was an artist. Despite being married, he gained a reputation as a womanizer, nicknamed “gato macho” (male cat) or seducer of women, which he took advantage of to promote himself. In a Mexico City newspaper column written by him, he claimed he had over 650 erotic encounters. He states that Bertha was not allowed the same freedom and that she never knew about his affairs despite his writings about them. He and Bertha had three daughters, Mariana, Ximena and María Jose. In 2000, Berta Riestra, his wife and, at the time, the director of the José Luis Cuevas Museum, died due to breast cancer and leukemia. The following year, he met Beatriz del Carmen Bazán, whom he married in 2003 at the museum.

Cuevas and his wife both lived in the San Ángel neighborhood of Mexico City. The house was built for Cuevas in the 1970s by architects Abraham Zabludovsky and Teodoro González de León in a style reminiscent of Luis Barragán. The walls are tones of gray with very straight lines. The interior is minimalist with paintings by the artist on the walls and wood furniture with Mexican textiles. While the house is clean and orderly, the space dedicated as his studio is messy, strewn with books, old machinery, a telescope, mirrors, many photographs and more.

==Exhibitions==

Within a career that spanned over seventy years, Cuevas was a painter, writer, draftsman, engraver, illustrator and printmaker. There have been solo exhibitions od Cuevas&#x27; work in museums and galleries throughout the world. His first exhibition was when he was only fourteen at the Seminario Axiologico but no one came, the works came off the walls and were stepped on. His first successful individual exhibition was at Mexico City&#x27;s Galería Prisse in 1953, when he was nineteen. In 1954, he meets the critic Jose Gomez-Sicre who invites him to exhibit at the Panamerican Union in Washington, DC. This, his first U.S. exhibition, sold out opening night and resulted in interviews with Time and the Washington Post, which called him a “golden boy,” opening doors and helping to sell his paintings. In 1955, he participated in the first Salón de Arte Libre organized by Galería Proteo, where he met David Alfaro Siqueiros. During the rest of the 1950s, he exhibited in Havana, Caracas, Lima and Buenos Aires, where he met Jorge Luis Borges.

In the 1960 he exhibited at the David Herbert Gallery, when the NY Times compared him to Picasso. In 1961, two of his works at the Galería del L’Oblisco in Rome, Los Funerales de un Dictador and La Caída de Franco caused a diplomatic conflict with Spain that asked the images to be removed. In 1962, he exhibited a series of works based on a sculpture by Tilman Riemenschneider he saw in Munich. Cuevas&#x27; other exhibitions from this period include one at the Silvan Simone Gallery in 1967.

During the 1970s, he exhibited 72 self-portraits at the Centro Cultural Universitario at UNAM, and exhibited other works at the San Francisco Museum of Art, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Caracas, Phoenix Art Museum, the Musee d’Art Moderne in Paris and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. In 1976, he had four women tattooed with original designs of his own making, so that the art “would grow old with him” This despite the fact that tattoos were illegal in Mexico at the time. In 1979 Jose Luis exhibits 50 watercolors and drawings along with illustrated letters at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla, California.

In 1981, he opened the exhibit &quot;Signs of Life&quot; which contained a vial with his semen and an electrocardiogram taken while he was making love. He stated in the exhibition&#x27;s brochure that he would impregnate any woman that asked him to do so, but the Secretaría de Gobernación made him to remove the brochure because it was then-considered as act of prostitution. In 1982, fourteen galleries in Mexico City, Barcelona, Paris and others held a simultaneous exhibits of &quot;“Marzo. Mes de José Luis Cuevas”&quot; (&quot;March. Month of Jose Luis Cuevas.&quot;) From 1984 to 1988, a series of 50 large format drawings called “Intolerance” toured universities and museums in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. These drawings were the result of Jose Tasende&#x27;s gift to Cuevas of the book &quot;The Witches&#x27; Advocate&quot; by Gustav Henningsen. In 1985 exhibits with Henry Moore and Eduardo Chillida in the exhibition Figure Space Image at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla, California. The illustrated letters he wrote to his dealer JM Tasende during his exile from Mexico are exhibited at Tasende Gallery prior to becoming part of the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

In 1991 &quot;Celebrating 25 Years with Jose Luis Cuevas&quot; opens at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla. He created a Talavera mural which was placed at the Zona Rosa neighborhood in 1995. In 1997 he exhibits at Tasende Gallery, West Hollywood, California. In 1998, he exhibited “Retrospectiva de Dibujo y Escultura” at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. In 1999, the Pablo Picasso Foundation presented the exhibition “José Luis Cuevas. Obra Gráfica&quot;.

In 2001, he donated a sculpture called “Figura Obscena” (Obscene Figure) to the city of Colima. This sculpture became the center of a scandal in 2006. Other exhibitions from the 2000s include in 2005 &quot;Jose Luis Cuevas in Drawing and Sculpture&quot; at the Latin American Art Museum in Long Beach, California. &quot;Selected Drawings and Watercolors&quot; Tasende Gallery, West Hollywood, California. In 2006, he inaugurated the Paseo Escultórico Nezahualcóyotl with a sculpture named after his wife called “Carmen.” Retrospective Exhibition at the Museum of the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City in 2008. “Exposición Siameses 50 Años de la Plástica del Maestro José Luis Cuevas” in 2009 and 2011 and “Dibujo y Escultura” in 2010. He continued to actively exhibit his work until his death, especially in Mexico.

==Publications==

By the age of fourteen, Cuevas had illustrated numerous periodicals and books. In 1957, he went to Philadelphia to illustrate the book &quot;The World of Kafka and Cuevas&quot; for Falcon Prest Publishers. In the late 1950s, he began to write on cultural topics for the &quot;Novedades de México&quot; publication, where he referred to the then mural artists establishment such as Diego Rivera as the (&quot;Nopal Cactus Curtain&quot;) and also advocated for greater artistic freedom. This philosophy inspired the founding in 1960 of the group Nueva Presencia, which he joined for a brief time. The group promoted individual expression and figurative art reflecting the contemporary human condition.

In the 1960s, his publications included &quot;Recollections of Childhood&quot; (1963), &quot;Cuevas-Chareton&quot; (1966), a book of lithographs made at the Tamarind Workshop in Los Angeles inspired by the Marquis de Sade and &quot;Homage to Quevedo&quot; an album of thirteen lithographs dedicated to Francisco de Quevedo.

In 1970, he presented &quot;Crime by Cuevas&quot; at the Primera Bienal del Grabado Latinoamericano in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The lithographic series called &quot;Cuevas Comedies&quot; was published in 1972, inspired by San Francisco. He “self-exiled” to France where he exhibited at the Modern Art Museum in Paris and the Chartres Cathedral and worked on several books, serigraphs and lithographs in works called “Cuaderno de París” and “La Renaudiere.” The first was honored at the Book Fair in Stuttgart, Germany in 1978.

In 1985, he began publishing a column called “Cuevario.” In 1987 he worked with the &quot;Crónica de la Ciudad de México&quot;. He published &quot;Arte-Objeto and Animales Impuros&quot; in 1995, which was inspired by a poem by José-Miguel Ullán. In 2012 he published &quot;Cartas amorosas a Beatriz del Carmen&quot; which contains 183 cards drawn by Cuevas for his wife.

==Artistic development and influence==

As Cuevas&#x27; education was interrupted by illness, he was mostly a self-taught artist. He was part of the first generation of Mexican artists to have emerged after the Muralist movement, and a main figure of both the Generación de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation) and Neo Figurativism, associated with writers and artists such as Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz and Fernando Benítez.

Cuevas was born and raised in a country which has produced major innovators in the fine arts, and he himself became a symbol of both the continuity of this tradition as well as a permanent break with the past. In particular, Cuevas was an early and very outspoken critic of the muralist movement led by the then-dominant artists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. His critiques focus on how these artists depicted Mexican social intertwine and how much their art was influenced by government propaganda through sponsorship. His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused him trouble at times, including violent public outcry to his work, written insults, personal threats and even once having had his own house attacked with a machine-gun. These are some of the reasons that earned him the nickname of &quot;il enfant terrible&quot; (&quot;The Bad Boy&quot;) of Mexican fine arts.

His initial opposition to the Mexican cultural status quo was with the muralists, calling them and the government that supported them the “nopal cactus curtain,” acting against newer artists and innovations. His first essay against the “nopal cactus curtain,” was to be published by Excélsior but ultimately rejected by the periodical, although he later renamed and published it as “Letter to Siqueiros” in a magazine titled &quot;Perfumes y Modas&quot; (&quot;Perfumes and Fashions&quot;) and dropped off a copy of the magazine at Siqueiros&#x27;s house. Later, with the help of Carlos Fuentes he published in &quot;Museo en la Cultura&quot; (&quot;Museum in Culture&quot;), a supplement of Novedades newspaper, where he continued his critique towards the Mexican muralist movement. Throughout this time, he became friends with a number of other writers such as Fernando Benítez, José Emilio Pacheco, José de la Colina, Carlos Monsiváis who, along with writer Carlos Fuentes, were known as “La Maffia” a critique group of Mexico&#x27;s then-current culture. It also earned him scorn and critique, especially from Leopoldo Méndez and Raúl Anguiano, as well as strong opposition from many at the Academy of San Carlos. Despite this opposition, Siqueiros wanted Cuevas to become part of the muralist group, saying that his work had an Orozco quality. Since that time, the muralism tradition waned but Cuevas remaines a controversial and oppositional figure, criticizing writers and artists he felt criticized the country&#x27;s corruption and other problems but at the same time were a party to them. He also stated that he was strongly against opposed to those who he felt used art for “fraudulent” ends as well as those who copied others’ work and those who sold out their art only to make money.

Themes in Cuevas’ work tend to be bleak, grotesque, enveloped in anguish and fantasy, with human figures distorted to the point of uniqueness. His work has been described as having a “great gestural ferocity” often preferring subjects relating to human degradation such as prostitution and despotism. His most characteristic work involves images of disfigured creatures and the misery of the contemporary world. Although he was not opposed to worldly pleasures, they are not depicted in his work. He stated that his work leans more towards the flesh in an “excessive” way with the presence of death. Cuevas said that his drawing representa the solitude and isolation of contemporary man and man&#x27;s inability to communicate. He also stated that it is an “invitation to return to vegetarianism.&quot;

Cuevas stated that he drew a skull as he considered them devoid of expression and they are not necessarily representative of death in Mexican culture. He preferred to draw cadavers and bodies shortly after death, as they still retain the individual human qualities. In this approach, he stated that he followed elements of German Expressionism, Catalan Romanesque and Romanticism of the 19th century. He felt very “Spanish” in this as Goya used to paint cadavers as well and yet, far from José Guadalupe Posada who drew skulls and bones. His work was influenced by Spanish poetry and Spanish cities as Seville and Barcelona have appeared in his works. His predilection for the darker side of life along with breaking with tradition has meant belated acceptance for his work in certain circles of the art market.

Cuevas’ influences included Goya, writer Francisco de Quevedo, Picasso, with some hues from Posada and Orozco. Over the years, he paid homage to his favorite painters and writers, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Francisco de Quevedo and Marquis de Sade, in numerous series of drawings and prints.

Cuevas&#x27;s style is aggressive and lacks inhibition which often shocks the observer. Cuevas&#x27;s drawings, which were done in pen and ink, gouache and watercolor, are mostly done on very large sheets of paper. In many of these drawings, the figures transform into animals or acquire an animal quality. Well acquainted with the cinematic arts, he manipulated data and even concocted events, drawing on his memory for plausible details. His best known event of this type was the creation of the “Mural Efímero” (Ephemeral Mural), which he created and immediately destroyed publicly as a challenge to the Mexican muralism movement. He gave what is now known as “Zona Rosa” its name, located in the then cosmopolitan section of Colonia Juarez, stating that &quot;Es demasiado ingenua para ser roja, pero demasiado frívola para ser blanca, por eso es precisamente rosa&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s too naive to be red, but too frivolous to be white, that&#x27;s why it is precisely pink.&quot;)

His work reates controversy to the end and his appearance attracted large numbers of women.

==Recognition==
Cuevas’ earliest award was in 1959, the International First Prize for Drawing at the São Paulo Biennale, with 40 works from the series Funeral of a Dictator, which was followed by First Prize at the International Black and White Exhibition in Lugano, Switzerland, in 1962. His other awards from the 1960s include the Prize for Excellence in Art and Design at the 29th Annual Exhibition of the Art Directors’ Club, Philadelphia, United States, in 1964, Premio Madeco at the II Bienal Iberoamericana de Grabado at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Santiago, Chile, in 1965 and First International Prize for Printmaking, Triennial of Graphic Arts, New Delhi, India, 1968.

In 1977 he won First Prize at the III Latin American Print Biennial in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1981, he earned the National Prize of Culture, which signified his acceptance by the people of Mexico. Cuevas&#x27; other honors of the 1980s included having his work exhibited at the 1982 Venice Biennial, Premio Nacional de Arte from the Mexican government in the same year, and the International Prize from the World Council of Engraving in the United States.

In the 1990s, he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France in 1991, induction in the National System of Creators of Mexico in 1993 and In 1997 the Premio de Medallística Tomás Francisco Prieta from Queen Sofía of Spain .

In the 2000s he received the Jerusalem Prize from the City of Jerusalem and the World Zionist Organization in 2007 and the Lorenzo the Great Prize at the VIII Biennial of Florence in 2012.

In addition to awards for his artwork, Cuevas received other honors as well. These include honorary doctorates from Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa (1984), the Universidad Veracruzana (2004), the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (2007) and the Instituto Superior de Arte and the Casa de las Américas in Havana (2008). He was honored as Captain of the Yaqui Army by the leaders of the Yaqui people in 1996. In 1989, the cities of Monterrey and Tijuana declared him an “honored guest” and he received the keys to the two cities.

==José Luis Cuevas Museum==

In the late 1980s, Cuevas obtained the old monastery of Santa Inés in Mexico City&#x27;s historical center for the purpose of creating the José Luis Cuevas Museum, which was inaugurated in 1992. The first director of the museum was his first wife, Bertha until her death in 2000. In 2005, his second wife, Beatriz del Carmen, took over operations. The Museum has been backed by the Fundación Maestro José Luis Cuevas since 2003. Because of the opposition in some essential artistic statements between José Luis Cuevas and some professors in the Academia de San Carlos, which is located half a block to the south, the artistic community in this art school say &quot;el vecino de enfrente&quot; (neighbor from across the street&quot; to refer to the now late artist and the Museum).

The Museum&#x27;s collection includes more than 1860 pieces by various artists, mostly from Latin America. The pieces are rotated among the various building&#x27;s rooms. One of the main pieces is &quot;La Giganta&quot; (&quot;The Giantess&quot;) by Cuevas, which is situated in the central courtyard. The androgynous sculpture was created in 1991 and inspired by a poem by Baudelaire. The museum is considered to be controversial in no small part due to the “Erotic Room,&quot; filled with Cuevas&#x27; own drawings on the theme and of actual bordellos and cabarets, and the presence of a large brass bed on which he claimed he had many sexual encounters. The museum also contains a library with 45 large volumes with over 11,500 newspaper clippings as well as 500 books dedicated to Cuevas&#x27; work.

<text>The Lamborghini Gallardo (; ) is a sports car built by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 2003 to 2013. It is Lamborghini&#x27;s second car released under parent company Audi, and the best-selling model at the time with 14,022 built throughout its production run. Named after a famous breed of fighting bull, the V10 powered Gallardo has been Lamborghini&#x27;s sales leader and stable-mate to a succession of V12 flagship models—first to the Murciélago (4,099 built between 2001 and 2010), then to the Aventador, being the first entry-level Lamborghini in one-and-half decades. On 25 November 2013, the last Gallardo was rolled off the production line. The Gallardo was replaced by the Huracán in 2014.
==Overview==

After Megatech purchased Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A in 1994, Italdesign Giugiaro was hired to design concept cars to replace their existing cars. One of the concepts built by them was the Lamborghini Calà, built to replace the Lamborghini Jalpa and was displayed at the 1995 Geneva Motor Show.

After the Volkswagen Group took hold of the company in 1998, the Lamborghini Gallardo was built on the basis of the Calà and had many features absorbed from the concept car such as the exterior design and the traditional V10 engine.

The car name is taken from the 18th century Spanish bullfighting breeder Francisco Gallardo. It means &quot;gallant&quot;.

==Specifications==

===Awards and recognition===
* 2006 &quot;Top Gear&quot; Dream Car of the Year
* 2009 &quot;Top Gear&quot; Car of the Year – Lamborghini LP 550-2 Balboni

==Gallardo (2003–2008)==
===Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe===

The original Gallardo was powered with an even firing 90 degree V10 engine generating a maximum power output of at 7500 rpm and of torque at 4500 RPM. The Gallardo was offered with two choices of transmission; a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed manual transmission, and a six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch automated manual transmission that Lamborghini called &quot;E-gear&quot;. Both gearboxes were built by Graziano Trasmissioni. The &quot;E-gear&quot; transmission provides gear changes more quickly than could be achieved through a manual shift. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever. The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was based on the 1995 Calà prototype designed by Italdesign Giugiaro.

====2005 Coupé update====
For the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005), Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20 PS to a maximum of , and the biggest change was overall lower gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear. These changes gave the car a much better performance than the original and were also included in the limited edition Gallardo SE.

===Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder===
The convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. It was considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with the engine having a power output of and a low-ratio six-speed manual transmission. The Spyder has a retractable soft-top.

===Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera===
At the 2007 Geneva Auto Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Gallardo Superleggera. The name paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini production model, the 350 GT, designed and built by Carrozzeria Touring and its emphasis on weight reduction. The Superleggera is lighter than the base model by due to the use of carbon fiber panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was uprated by courtesy of an improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total power output of . The 6-speed E-Gear transmission was standard on US spec models with the 6-speed manual transmission offered as a no cost option. Production of the Superleggera was limited to 618 units worldwide.

====Recall====
Lamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of power steering fluid leaking and the risk of fire. The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008.
==Facelift (2008–2013)==
===Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4===

Presented at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, the Gallardo LP 560-4 was a significant update of the Gallardo, powered by a new, uneven firing V10 engine that produces at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 6,500 rpm. Featuring &quot;Iniezione Diretta Stratificata&quot; direct fuel injection system to improve efficiency; fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 18% despite the increase in performance. The car was redesigned, inspired by the Murciélago LP 640 and its derivative model the Reventón.

The new engine, more powerful than in the previous car, comes with two transmission choices: a 6-speed manual or 6-speed E-gear, the latter of which was revised to offer a Corsa mode which makes 40% quicker shifts than before and decreases traction control restrictions, a Thrust Mode launch control system was also added. Accompanied with a weight reduction. All the improvements add up to a claimed performance of 0- in 3.7 seconds, 0- of 11.8 and a top speed of .

The MSRP base price was $198,000 in the US and £147,330 (including NavTrak vehicle tracking system and delivery package) in the UK. The first US car was sold in the 16th Annual Race to Erase MS charity auction for $198,000 to former True Religion Jeans co-founder/co-creator Kymberly Gold and music producer Victor Newman.

===Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4 Spyder===

==Concept cars==
===Lamborghini Concept S===
The Lamborghini Concept S is a concept car based on the Gallardo, featuring a speedster (Barchetta) body designed by Luc Donckerwolke. It was built in 2005 and was first shown at that year&#x27;s Geneva Motor Show. The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a &#x27;saute-vent&#x27; (French for &#x27;change wind&#x27;) instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0 L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow. The rear-view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumored to be building 100 examples for customers but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby&#x27;s Manhattan event &quot;Driven by Disruption&quot;. It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell. In 2023 one of the two prototypes arrived in a Miami car dealer named CURATED.

==Motorsports==
=== FIA GT3 Championship ===
In 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the FIA GT3 Championship, with the Gallardo GT3, built by German motorsport specialists Reiter Engineering, who previously manufactured the Murciélago R-GT and the Diablo GTR Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. Brembo racing brakes and OZ Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear-wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo. The engine generated a maximum power output of at 7,800 rpm and of torque at 4,500 RPM.

=== ADAC GT Masters ===
The inaugural season of ADAC GT Masters was held in 2007 and the championship was won by the Lamborghini Gallardo LP520 GT3 driven by Christopher Haase, Gianni Morbidelli and Jos Menten.

The engine could only have a power output of and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictions placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.

=== Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo ===

In May 2009 Lamborghini introduced what it calls the &#x27;Fastest one-make series in the world&#x27;, featuring the Gallardo LP 560-4 Super Trofeo, a race-prepared version of the newer Gallardo LP 560-4. The series supported European race series such as Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), FIA GT Series and the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), featuring 18 races overall and having a 30-car grid consisting of privateer teams as well as Lamborghini dealer teams and one factory team featuring guest drivers.

The car has dry weight of . E-gear transmission was standard.

=== American Le Mans Series ===
West Racing campaigned an LP 560 GT in the GT class of the American Le Mans Series for certain races of the 2011 season. However, as of July 2011, the team announced that they were developing a new car and by implication would no longer race the LP 560.

=== Speed World Challenge ===
DP7 Racing has currently entered two Gallardos in the Speed World Challenge GT Series, driven by Dan Pastorini and Chip Herr.

==Gas tank issues==
The Gallardo features a unique gas port located on the top of the car, and is designed in a way that is incompatible with the anti-vapor sheath that most American gas stations use as a safety feature. This design issue causes gas pumps to fail to engage, or disengage in the middle of the fill process. Lamborghini owners have resorted to using mechanical hacks, such as pulling back the sheath with their fingers, or employing a plastic ring fitted over the port to force the sheath backwards.

<doc id="623025" wikidata="Q5189019" url="?curid=623025" title="Crouch End (short story)">
<text>&quot;Crouch End&quot; is a horror story by Stephen King, set in the real-life North London district of Crouch End, originally published in &quot;New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos&quot; (1980), and republished in a slightly different version in King&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; collection (1993). It contains distinct references to the horror fiction of H. P. Lovecraft.

A television adaptation aired July 12, 2006 on TNT, as part of &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&quot;. A song by British black metal/dark ambient band The Axis of Perdition uses excerpts from the story as lyrics.

==Plot==
Police constables Ted Vetter and Robert Farnham are working the night shift at a small station in the London suburb of Crouch End. They discuss the case of Doris Freeman, a young American woman who came in to report the disappearance of her husband, lawyer Lonnie Freeman. Nearly hysterical, Doris arrived in the station speaking of monsters and supernatural occurrences. 

Doris relates how she and her husband got lost while searching for a potential employer&#x27;s house in Crouch End. While they are looking up the employer&#x27;s address in a phone book, the cab they had hired mysteriously disappears, and the entire neighborhood becomes strangely deserted and alien, with the sole exception of a cat with a scarred face and two children, one of whom has a deformed hand. After encountering something unseen beyond a hedge, Lonnie becomes unhinged. He eventually disappears while the couple is walking through a tunnel, leaving Doris alone and scared out of her mind as the surroundings become increasingly bizarre; even the night sky no longer shows Earth&#x27;s stars, but some unknown alien sky. Eventually, Doris once again encounters the two disfigured children, who summon an enormous, hideous, otherworldly being from beneath the ground of Crouch End (implied to be the Lovecraftian goddess Shub-Niggurath). The monster has seemingly consumed Lonnie along with countless others, whose spirits are now trapped in its body and whose faces Doris glimpses trapped in the body of the being. After that, Doris remembers nothing else until she woke up huddled in an entranceway back in the real world.

Newcomer Farnham dismisses the story as a delusion caused by mental illness, but Vetter, who has policed Crouch End for decades, is not so sure, remembering a number of similar missing-person cases from years gone by. He speculates about other planes of existence, and of Crouch End perhaps being a location where the divide between our world and an alien, demonic world is somehow less robust. 

Vetter goes out for a walk. After contemplating the story for a while, Farnham wonders what has become of him. Leaving the station empty, he walks down the street in search of Vetter and notices that something seems strangely different about the neighborhood, most notably that the streetlights at the bottom of the street have all gone out. Farnham turns the corner at the bottom of the street and walks out of sight of the station - and is never seen again. Vetter returns from his walk just minutes later and can find no clue to Farnham&#x27;s whereabouts. The official investigation into his vanishing can find no leads, and Vetter reaches retirement age soon after; he dies of a heart attack in his home six months later. Doris returns to America with her children, where she attempts suicide and spends time in a mental hospital, but eventually learns to live with the memory of Crouch End and is released. The story ends with the statement that there are still strange occurrences in Crouch End, and that, very occasionally, people are &quot;...known to lose their way. Some of them lose it forever.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
The short story was adapted into an episode of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King,&quot; starring Eion Bailey and Claire Forlani. Virginia Heffernan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that it &quot;has a simpler charm&quot; than previous episodes and that the couple&#x27;s terror at being lost makes &quot;a grand subject for horror.&quot; Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict rated the episode D+ and stated that the story doesn&#x27;t work on television. Christopher Noseck of DVD Talk panned the episode in part because of the special effects, which he called &quot;laughable&quot;.

The audiobook version of this story was narrated by actor Tim Curry.

<doc id="623026" wikidata="Q7759254" url="?curid=623026" title="The Raft (short story)">
<text>&quot;The Raft&quot; is a horror short story by Stephen King. It was first published as a booklet included with &quot;Gallery&quot; in November 1982 and was collected in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Four college students – Randy, Deke, Rachel, and LaVerne – swim to a wooden raft on a remote Pennsylvania lake in October as a final outing before winter. Randy notices a mysterious black substance floating on the surface that appears to chase the girls as they reach the raft. Deke and LaVerne ridicule Randy&#x27;s suspicions until Rachel remarks on the beautiful bands of colors on the patch&#x27;s oily surface and touches it. The black patch pulls her into the water, coats her, begins to dissolve her and finally, wholly envelops her. The horrified trio helplessly watch as she is devoured, expanding the size of the black shape. 

After the initial panic, the three contemplate their situation. They realize swimming past the black substance is not possible, as it moves too fast. The group told no one else about their outing and drove eight miles from the nearest main road, so they cannot hope to be rescued. Their only option is to wait and see if the thing leaves. Gazing at the creature&#x27;s beautifully iridescent surface entrances and disorients the onlookers, nearly causing them to fall off the raft. When the creature floats under the raft, Deke prepares to make a desperate jump into the lake to swim to the shore. But the creature oozes up through two boards and grabs him by his foot, pulling his leg through the crack in the boards. Randy and LaVerne are forced to watch as Deke is devoured and dragged through the crack, slowly and laboriously. LaVerne faints, and Randy fights to maintain his sanity. Randy contemplates swimming to shore while the creature eats Deke but realizes that means he would have to leave the unconscious LaVerne behind.

After LaVerne regains consciousness, she and Randy take turns sitting, standing, and watching the creature, allowing brief moments of rest for one while the other watches for when the black patch goes under the raft. At night, LaVerne convinces Randy that they should sit and watch it together. As the temperature drops, the two slowly embrace for warmth and gradually begin to have sex, Randy assuring her that he will keep an eye on the creature. However, he is distracted by the hypnotic colors of the creature and, when LaVerne&#x27;s hair falls over the side of the raft, the creature tangles itself in her hair and flows over her face. Knowing he will be unable to save her, he kicks her over the side of the raft in a panic, quickening her death.

Randy barely gets any sleep as night falls, since the creature flows under the raft every time Randy tries to sit down, forcing him to remain permanently standing. Randy finally breaks down and gives up, acknowledging the hopelessness of the situation. He fantasizes about rescue and sings deliriously, suffering from extreme fatigue. At last, Randy turns to the creature and contemplates if the creature&#x27;s hypnotizing colors will take the pain out of being consumed. Randy does not look away as the creature&#x27;s colors shimmer at him.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Raft&quot; was adapted to film as a segment of the 1987 horror anthology movie &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, directed by Michael Gornick from a screenplay by George A. Romero.

The bulk of the story is faithful to the short story, but the ending was changed for the film. As soon as the creature takes LaVerne, Randy makes a swim for shore and is quickly pursued. Crawling out to apparent safety a few feet from the water&#x27;s edge, he yells &quot;I beat you! Whatever you are, I beat you!&quot; The creature then becomes a wave, throwing itself up on the shore and engulfs him. As the creature quietly slides back down into the lake, the screen pans over a no-swimming sign that also features a warning, which was hidden in overgrown reeds, near the now-abandoned Camaro. 

This segment of the movie was filmed at Granite Basin Lake in Prescott, Arizona.

==Background==
In the intro to the story in &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; and in afterword to the book &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, King relates an anecdote about the story&#x27;s possible 1969 publication in &quot;Adam&quot; magazine in different form, under the title &quot;The Float&quot;. A short time after the story was accepted, King was arrested in the town of Orono, Maine, for removing traffic cones from the street after one of them had damaged his car. He was unable to pay the fine and was about to be jailed when the payment check for &quot;The Float&quot; arrived, an event King referred to as asking to &quot;have someone send you a real Get Out of Jail Free card.&quot; Despite receiving payment, King has never located a copy of the magazine with the published story in it.

==Reception==
Reviewing &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Susan Bolotin called the story &quot;wonderfully gruesome&quot;.

<text>Borley Rectory was a house located in Borley, Essex, famous for being described as &quot;the most haunted house in England&quot; by psychic researcher Harry Price. Built in 1862 to house the rector of the parish of Borley and his family, the house was badly damaged by fire in 1939 and demolished in 1944.

The large Gothic-style rectory had been alleged to be haunted ever since it was built. These reports multiplied suddenly in 1929 after the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper published an account of a visit by Price, who wrote two books supporting claims of paranormal activity.

Price&#x27;s reports prompted a formal study by the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price&#x27;s credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. However, neither the SPR&#x27;s report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.

A short programme commissioned by the BBC about the alleged manifestations, scheduled to be broadcast in September 1956, was cancelled owing to concerns about a possible legal action by Marianne Foyster, widow of the last rector to live in Borley Rectory. In 1975 the BBC aired a programme entitled &quot;The Ghost Hunters&quot; that focused on the house and conducted interviews with several psychic researchers, including Peter Underwood. It also featured a late-night psychic investigation of nearby Borley Church.

==History==
Borley Rectory was constructed on Hall Road in the village of Borley, Essex, in 1862, near Borley Church. The house was built by the Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull; he moved in a year after being named rector of the parish. The house replaced an earlier rectory on the site that had been destroyed by fire in 1841. It was eventually enlarged by the addition of a wing to house Bull&#x27;s family of fourteen children.

The nearby church, the nave of which may date from the 12th century, serves a scattered rural community of three hamlets that make up the parish. There are several substantial farmhouses and the fragmentary remains of Borley Hall, once the seat of the Waldegrave family. Legend claims that a Benedictine monastery was supposedly built in this area in about 1362, and that a monk from the monastery conducted a relationship with a nun from a nearby convent. After their affair was discovered, the monk was executed and the nun reportedly bricked up alive in the convent walls. This legend was debunked in 1938 as it was confirmed that it had no historical basis known and could have been fabricated by the rector&#x27;s children to romanticise the rectory. The story of the walling up of the nun may have come from Rider Haggard&#x27;s novel &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1893) or Walter Scott&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Marmion&quot; (1808).

==Hauntings==
The first paranormal events at Borley Rectory reportedly occurred in about 1863, since a few locals later remembered having heard unexplained footsteps within the house at about that time. On 28 July 1900, four of Bull&#x27;s daughters saw what they thought was the ghost of a nun at twilight, about from the house; they tried to talk to it, but it disappeared as they got closer. Local organist Ernest Ambrose later said that the Bull family were &quot;very convinced that they had seen an apparition on several occasions&quot;. Various people claimed to have witnessed a variety of puzzling incidents, such as a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen, during the next four decades. Bull died in 1892 and his son, the Reverend Henry (&quot;Harry&quot;) Foyster Bull, took over the parish.

Upon Harry Bull&#x27;s death on 9 June 1927, Borley Rectory became vacant. In the following year, on 2 October, the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the house. Soon after moving in, Smith&#x27;s wife, while cleaning out a cupboard, reportedly came across a brown paper package containing the skull of a young woman. Shortly afterwards the family reported a variety of incidents, including the sounds of servant bells ringing despite being disconnected, lights appearing in windows, and unexplained footsteps. In addition, Smith&#x27;s wife believed she saw a horse-drawn carriage at night. 

The Smiths contacted the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper asking to be put in touch with the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). On 10 June 1929 the newspaper sent a reporter, who promptly wrote the first in a series of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley Rectory. The paper also arranged for Harry Price, a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the house. He arrived on 12 June and immediately phenomena of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. &quot;Spirit messages&quot; were tapped out from the frame of a mirror. As soon as Price left, these occurrences ceased. Smith&#x27;s wife later maintained that she suspected Price, an expert conjurer, of falsifying the phenomena.

The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929, and the parish had some difficulty in finding a replacement. On 16 October 1930, the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (1899–1992) moved into the house along with their adopted daughter Adelaide. Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time his family moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, the throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of Adelaide in a room with no key. Marianne reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed. On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by &quot;something horrible&quot;. Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; in the middle of the first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. 

Because of coverage of the case by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, these incidents attracted the attention of several paranormal researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by Marianne. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. Marianne later admitted that she was having a sexual relationship with a lodger named Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons.

The Foyster family left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster&#x27;s ill health.

==Price investigation==
Borley Rectory remained vacant for some time after the Foysters&#x27; departure. In May 1937, Price took out a year-long rental agreement with Queen Anne&#x27;s Bounty, the owners of the property. Through an advertisement printed in &quot;The Times&quot; on 25 May 1937, and subsequent personal interviews, he recruited a corps of 48 &quot;official observers&quot;, mostly students, who spent periods, mainly during weekends, at the house with instructions to report any phenomena that occurred. 

In March 1938, Helen Glanville (the daughter of S. J. Glanville, one of Price&#x27;s helpers) conducted a planchette séance in Streatham, London. Price reported that she made contact with two spirits, the first of which was that of a young nun who identified herself as Marie Lairre. According to the planchette story, Marie was a French nun who left her religious order and travelled to England to marry a member of the Waldegrave family. She was said to have been murdered in an older building on the site of Borley Rectory, and her body was either buried in the cellar or thrown into a disused well. The wall-writings were alleged to be her pleas for help; one read, &quot;Marianne, please help me get out&quot;.

The second spirit to be contacted identified himself as Sunex Amures, and claimed that he would set fire to Borley Rectory at nine o&#x27;clock that night, 27 March 1938. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.

===Fire===

On 27 February 1939, the new owner of Borley Rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was unpacking boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway. The house was never connected to a gas or electricity supply, and water was obtained from a well in the courtyard. The fire quickly spread and the house was severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze, the insurance company concluded that the fire seemed to have been started deliberately.

A Miss Williams from nearby Borley Lodge said she saw the figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window during the fire and, according to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found belonged to a pig.

==Society for Psychical Research investigation==
After Price&#x27;s death in 1948, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reporter Charles Sutton accused him of faking phenomena. Sutton claimed that whilst visiting Borley Rectory with Price in 1929, he was hit on the head by a large pebble. Sutton stated that he seized Price and found his coat pockets filled with different sized stones.

In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, three members of the SPR, two of whom had been Price&#x27;s most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley Rectory. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, &quot;The Haunting of Borley Rectory&quot;, which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.

The &quot;Borley Report&quot;, as the SPR study has become known, stated that many of the phenomena were either faked or due to natural causes, such as rats and the strange acoustics attributed to the odd shape of the house. In their conclusion, the three authors wrote, &quot;[W]hen analysed, the evidence for haunting and poltergeist activity for each and every period appears to diminish in force and finally to vanish away.&quot; Terence Hines wrote that &quot;Mrs. Marianne Foyster, wife of the Rev. Lionel Foyster who lived at the rectory from 1930 to 1935, was actively engaged in fraudulently creating [haunted] phenomena. Price himself &#x27;salted the mine&#x27; and faked several phenomena while he was at the rectory.&quot;

Marianne Foyster later admitted she had seen no apparitions and that the alleged ghostly noises were caused by the wind, friends she invited to the house and in other cases by herself playing practical jokes on her husband. Many of the legends about Borley Rectory had also been invented. The children of the Rev. Harry Bull, who lived in the house before Lionel Foyster, claimed to have seen nothing and were surprised they had been living in what was described as England&#x27;s most haunted house.

Robert Hastings was one of the few SPR researchers to defend Price. Price&#x27;s literary executor, Paul Tabori, and SPR researcher Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman, in an SPR report in 1997, wrote that Price&#x27;s defenders were unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.

==Film==
In 2017, the part-animated film &quot;Borley Rectory: The Most Haunted House in England&quot; was released. It was written and directed by Ashley Thorpe and starred Reece Shearsmith and Jonathan Rigby.

In 2021, the feature film &quot;The Ghosts of Borley Rectory&quot; was released. It was written and directed by Steven M. Smith and starred Julian Sands, Toyah Willcox, Colin Baker and Christopher Ellison.

<doc id="623034" wikidata="Q1506572" url="?curid=623034" title="Atrial flutter">
<text>Atrial flutter (AFL) is a common abnormal heart rhythm that starts in the atrial chambers of the heart. When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate and is classified as a type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Atrial flutter is characterized by a sudden-onset (usually) regular abnormal heart rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in which the heart rate is fast. Symptoms may include a feeling of the heart beating too fast, too hard, or skipping beats, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, a feeling as if one&#x27;s stomach has dropped, a feeling of being light-headed, or loss of consciousness.
Although this abnormal heart rhythm typically occurs in individuals with cardiovascular disease (e.g., high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy) and diabetes mellitus, it may occur spontaneously in people with otherwise normal hearts. It is typically not a stable rhythm and often degenerates into atrial fibrillation (AF). But rarely does it persist for months or years. Similar to the abnormal heart rhythm atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter also leads to poor contraction of the atrial chambers of the heart. This leads to the pooling of the blood in the heart and can lead to the formation of blood clots in the heart, which poses a significant risk of breaking off and traveling through the bloodstream, resulting in strokes.
A supraventricular tachycardia with a ventricular heart rate of 150 beats per minute is suggestive (though not necessarily diagnostic) of atrial flutter. Administration of adenosine in the vein (intravenously) can help medical personnel differentiate between atrial flutter and other forms of supraventricular tachycardia. Immediate treatment of atrial flutter centers on slowing the heart rate with medications such as beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem) if the affected person is not having chest pain, has not lost consciousness, and if their blood pressure is normal (known as stable atrial flutter). If the affected person is having chest pain, has lost consciousness, or has low blood pressure (unstable atrial flutter), then an urgent electrical shock to the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm is necessary. Long-term use of blood thinners (e.g., warfarin or apixaban) is an important component of treatment to reduce the risk of blood clot formation in the heart and resultant strokes. Medications used to restore a normal heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics) such as ibutilide effectively control atrial flutter about 80% of the time when they are started but atrial flutter recurs at a high rate (70–90% of the time) despite continued use. Atrial flutter can be treated more definitively with a technique known as catheter ablation. This involves the insertion of a catheter through a vein in the groin which is followed up to the heart and is used to identify and interrupt the electrical circuit causing the atrial flutter (by creating a small burn and scar).
Atrial flutter was first identified as an independent medical condition in 1920 by the British physician Sir Thomas Lewis (1881–1945) and colleagues. AFL is the second most common pathologic supraventricular tachycardia but occurs at a rate less than one-tenth of the most common supraventricular tachycardia (atrial fibrillation). The overall incidence of AFL has been estimated at 88 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of AFL is significantly lower (~5 cases/100,000 person-years) in those younger than age 50 and is far more common (587 cases/100,000 person-years) in those over 80 years of age.

==Signs and symptoms==
While atrial flutter can sometimes go unnoticed, its onset is often marked by characteristic sensations of the heart feeling like it is beating too fast or hard. Such sensations usually last until the episode resolves, or until the heart rate is controlled.

Atrial flutter is usually well-tolerated initially (a high heart rate is, for most people just a normal response to exercise); however, people with other underlying heart diseases (such as coronary artery disease) or poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, nausea and, in some patients, nervousness and feelings of impending doom.

Prolonged atrial flutter with fast heart rates may lead to decompensation with loss of normal heart function (heart failure). This may manifest as exercise intolerance (exertional breathlessness), difficulty breathing at night, or swelling of the legs and/or abdomen.

===Complications===
Although often regarded as a relatively benign heart rhythm problem, atrial flutter shares the same complications as the related condition atrial fibrillation. There is a paucity of published data directly comparing the two, but overall mortality in these conditions appears to be very similar.

====Rate-related====
Rapid heart rates may produce significant symptoms in patients with pre-existing heart disease and can lead to inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle and even a heart attack.

In rare situations, atrial flutter associated with a fast heart rate persists for an extended period of time without being corrected to a normal heart rhythm and leads to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Even in individuals with a normal heart, if the heart beats too quickly for a prolonged period of time, this can lead to ventricular decompensation and heart failure.

====Clot formation====
Because there is little, if any, effective contraction of the atria, there is stasis (pooling) of blood in the atria. Stasis of blood in susceptible individuals can lead to the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) within the heart. A thrombus is most likely to form in the atrial appendages. A blood clot in the left atrial appendage is particularly important as the left side of the heart supplies blood to the entire body through the arteries. Thus, any thrombus material that dislodges from this side of the heart can embolize (break off and travel) to the brain&#x27;s arteries, with the potentially devastating consequence of a stroke. Thrombus material can embolize to any other portion of the body, though usually with a less severe outcome.

====Sudden cardiac death====
Sudden death is not directly associated with atrial flutter. However, in individuals with a pre-existing accessory conduction pathway, such as the bundle of Kent in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the accessory pathway &quot;may&quot; conduct activity from the atria to the ventricles at a rate that the AV node would usually block. Bypassing the AV node, the atrial rate of 300 beats/minute leads to a ventricular rate of 300 beats/minute (1:1 conduction). Even if the ventricles are able to sustain a cardiac output at such a high rate, 1:1 flutter with time may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing hemodynamic collapse and death.

==Pathophysiology==
Atrial flutter is caused by a re-entrant rhythm. This usually occurs along the cavo-tricuspid isthmus of the right atrium though atrial flutter can originate in the left atrium as well. Typically initiated by a premature electrical impulse arising in the atria, atrial flutter is propagated due to differences in refractory periods of atrial tissue. This creates electrical activity that moves in a localized self-perpetuating loop, which usually lasts about 200 milliseconds for the complete circuit. For each cycle around the loop, an electric impulse results and propagates through the atria.

The impact and symptoms of atrial flutter depend on the heart rate of the affected person. Heart rate is a measure of ventricular rather than atrial activity. Impulses from the atria are conducted to the ventricles through the atrio-ventricular node (AV node). In a person with atrial flutter, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will demonstrate the atrial chambers of the heart contracting at a rate of 280–300 beats per minute whereas the ventricular chambers of the heart typically beat at a rate of 140–150 beats per minute. Due primarily to its longer refractory period, the AV node exerts a protective effect on heart rate by blocking atrial impulses in excess of about 180 beats/minute, for the example of a resting heart rate. (This block is dependent on the age of the patient and can be calculated roughly by subtracting patient age from 220). If the flutter rate is 300 beats per minute, only half of these impulses will be conducted, giving a ventricular rate of 150 beats per minute, or a 2:1 heart block. The addition of rate-controlling drugs or conduction system disease can increase this block substantially

==Diagnosis==
Typical atrial flutter is recognized on an electrocardiogram by the presence of characteristic &quot;flutter waves&quot; at a regular rate of 250 to 350 beats per minute. Flutter waves may not be evident on an ECG in atypical forms of atrial flutter. Individual flutter waves may be symmetrical, resembling p-waves, or maybe asymmetrical with a &quot;sawtooth&quot; shape, rising gradually and falling abruptly or vice versa. If atrial flutter is suspected clinically but is not clearly evident on ECG, acquiring a Lewis lead ECG may be helpful in revealing flutter waves.

===Classification===
There are two types of atrial flutter, the common &quot;type I&quot; and rarer &quot;type II&quot;. Most individuals with atrial flutter will manifest only one of these. Rarely someone may manifest both types; however, they can manifest only one type at a time.

====Type I====
Type I atrial flutter, also known as common atrial flutter or typical atrial flutter, has an atrial rate of 240 to 340 beats/minute. However, this rate may be slowed by antiarrhythmic agents.

The reentrant loop circles the right atrium, passing through the cavo-tricuspid isthmus – a body of fibrous tissue in the lower atrium between the inferior vena cava, and the tricuspid valve. Type I flutter is further divided into two subtypes, known as counterclockwise atrial flutter and clockwise atrial flutter depending on the direction of current passing through the loop.
* Counterclockwise atrial flutter (known as cephalad-directed atrial flutter) is more commonly seen. The flutter waves in this rhythm are inverted in ECG leads II, III, and aVF.
* The re-entry loop cycles in the opposite direction in clockwise atrial flutter, thus the flutter waves are upright in II, III, and aVF.

====Type II====
Type II (atypical) atrial flutter follows a significantly different re-entry pathway to type I flutter, and is typically faster, usually 340–350 beats/minute. Atypical atrial flutter rarely occurs in people who have not undergone previous heart surgery or previous catheter ablation procedures. Left atrial flutter is considered atypical and is common after incomplete left atrial ablation procedures. Atypical atrial flutter originating from the right atrium and heart&#x27;s septum have also been described.

==Management==
In general, atrial flutter should be managed in the same way as atrial fibrillation. Because both rhythms can lead to the formation of a blood clot in the atrium, individuals with atrial flutter usually require some form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agent. Both rhythms can be associated with dangerously fast heart rates and thus require medication to control the heart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers) and/or rhythm control with class III antiarrhythmics (such as ibutilide or dofetilide). However, atrial flutter is more resistant to correction with such medications than atrial fibrillation. For example, although the class III antiarrhythmic agent ibutilide is an effective treatment for atrial flutter, rates of recurrence after treatment are quite high (70–90%). Additionally, there are some specific considerations particular to treatment of atrial flutter.

===Cardioversion===

Atrial flutter is considerably more sensitive to electrical direct current cardioversion than atrial fibrillation, with a shock of only 20 to 50 Joules commonly being enough to cause a return to a normal heart rhythm (sinus rhythm). Exact placement of the pads does not appear important.

===Ablation===
Due to the reentrant nature of atrial flutter, it is often possible to ablate the circuit that causes atrial flutter with radiofrequency catheter ablation or pulsed field ablation. Catheter ablation was considered to be a first-line treatment method for many people with typical atrial flutter due to its high rate of success (&gt;90%) and low incidence of complications, although pulsed field ablation now offers a non-thermal option. This is done in the cardiac electrophysiology lab by causing a ridge of scar tissue in the cavotricuspid isthmus that crosses the path of the circuit that causes atrial flutter. Eliminating conduction through the isthmus prevents reentry, and if successful, prevents the recurrence of the atrial flutter. Atrial fibrillation often occurs (30% within 5 years) after catheter ablation for atrial flutter.

<doc id="623037" wikidata="Q4127421" url="?curid=623037" title="Word Processor of the Gods">
<text>&quot;Word Processor of the Gods&quot; is a short story by American writer Stephen King, first published in the January 1983 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine under the title &quot;The Word Processor&quot;. It was collected in King&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
Richard Hagstrom, a middle-aged writer, is disenchanted with his tyrannical wife Lena, his disrespectful teenage son Seth, and his life in general. His teenage nephew Jonathan suddenly dies in a car accident caused by the writer&#x27;s abusive brother Roger, who was driving drunk. Roger dies in the crash, along with Jonathan&#x27;s gentle, kind mother, Belinda (who had originally dated Richard before Roger married her). From the boy&#x27;s effects, the writer is given a word processor, which Jonathan was seemingly in the process of cobbling together from a dozen different sources before he died. When the writer turns it on, the start-up message displays &quot;Happy birthday, Uncle Richard&quot;, revealing that it was intended as a birthday gift for the main character. At home, Richard discovers that the processor has the mysterious ability to affect reality, but the electronics in the patchwork machine are brittle and will not function for long.

While in the middle of testing the processor, Richard&#x27;s son returns home alongside his obnoxious band members. Overhearing his son badmouthing him, Richard deletes him, which retroactively erases his existence. His bandmates are gone, his room is empty, and every trace of him ever living there is gone. When his wife returns home, he finds she is now even fatter than when she left, the result of never having any children. After she verbally abuses him, he deletes her as well.

With the processor now rapidly deteriorating, Richard impulsively rewrites reality, making the nephew his own son, and his sister-in-law his wife, moments before the processor irreparably breaks. He turns around, finding the nephew alive once again, now calling him &quot;Dad&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Word Processor of the Gods&quot; was adapted for an episode of the &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; TV series, first broadcast November 25, 1984.

A similar concept is used in the first episode of the 2019 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series, in which a stand-up comedian incorporates details about people he knows into his routines, unaware that every joke results in someone being erased from existence.

<text>&quot;Nona&quot; is a short horror story by Stephen King, first published in the 1978 anthology &quot;Shadows&quot; and later collected in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story is the account of an unnamed man being held in prison, recounting his life as a college dropout who met and fell in love with a beautiful girl named Nona, while aimlessly hitchhiking on a snowy winter&#x27;s night in Maine. That night, the narrator is seduced by Nona into murdering several innocent bystanders. Somewhere near Castle Rock, Nona lures the narrator to a graveyard and morphs into a hideously large rat which laughs at him. It&#x27;s not immediately clear whether the narrator has encountered a supernatural force or Nona is a figment of his insanity. Later, the narrator is found alone by the authorities, taken into custody, and sentenced to prison where he now writes his tale. Also, the narrator is preparing to commit suicide as he contemplates hearing strange sounds in the walls (not unlike H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; (1924), King&#x27;s own earlier short story, &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1978), or King&#x27;s later novella &quot;1922&quot; (2010)).

==Connection to King&#x27;s other works==
In &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (1999) there is a character called Ronnie Malenfant, who has the same surname as the character Betsy Malenfant which appears in &quot;Nona&quot;. In &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot;, Ronnie refers to having a sister.

Ace Merrill and Vern Tessio, who first appeared in &quot;The Body&quot; (1982), were not in the original version of this story but were added in flashback by King before the publication of Skeleton Crew in 1985. Ace later played a major role in &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1991).

<text>The cherry barb (Rohanella titteya) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is endemic to Sri Lanka, and introduced populations have become established in Mexico and Colombia. The cherry barb was named &quot;Puntius titteya&quot; by Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1929. Synonyms include &quot;Barbus titteya&quot; and &quot;Capoeta titteya&quot;. It is the only species in the genus Rohanella.

The species is commercially important in the aquarium trade and farmed in larger numbers, but it remains threatened by overcollection and habitat loss.

==Taxonomy==
The cherry barb was first formally described as &quot;Puntius titteya&quot; in 1929 by the Sri Lankan naturalist Paul E. P. Deraniyagala with its type locality given as Ambagaspitiya in Sri Lanka. In 2023 Hiranya Sudasinghe, Lukas Rüber and Madhava Meegaskumbura proposed that this species be classified within the new monospecific genus &quot;Rohanella&quot;. This taxon is classified within the subfamily Smiliogastrinae within the family Cyprinidae.

==Etymology==
The cherry barb is the only species in the genus &quot;Rohanella&quot;, this name honours the Sri Lankan biologist Rohan Pethiyagoda, whofirst recognised that some Sri Lankan barbs formerly classified in the genus &quot;Puntius&quot; should be reclassified in seaparte genera. The specific name &quot;tittaya&quot; is the Sinhala name for this fish.

==Description==
The cherry barb is a small elongated fish with a relatively compressed body. It reaches in length. The female is fawn-colored on top with a slight greenish sheen. Its sides and belly have gleaming silver highlights. It may have a rosy tone on its back and upper sides. A horizontal stripe extends from the tip of the snout through the eye to the base of the caudal fin. The male has a reddish color, becoming very deep red when breeding, and a more slender body shape. The females have two pinkish color stripes down their sides, also becoming darker when ready to breed.
==Habitat==
The cherry barb&#x27;s natural habitat is a heavily shaded, shallow, and calm water body. Its native substrate is silty with leaf cover. It comes from a tropical climate and prefers water with a pH of 6 to 8, a water hardness (dH) of 5 to 19, and a temperature range of .

==In the aquarium==
The fish is most often kept in community tanks by aquarium hobbyists. The cherry barb is a schooling fish and is best kept in groups of five or more individuals, though the schools are often less discrete than those of other barbs. Within these schools, there will most likely be a hierarchy. There should be a ratio of at least two females to one male. The male will constantly harass the females to breed, and if there are multiple females, each can escape the attention of the male for a time. The average life span is four years, with a maximum of around seven years. The tank should have abundant plant material (about two-thirds to three-quarters of the tank), but the fish also needs open space to swim. It tends to hide and will often withdraw under the cover of plants. The younger male is generally peaceful, but a mature male can be aggressive when breeding. Appropriate tankmates include &quot;Rasbora&quot; and similar calm fish.

==Breeding==
When breeding, the male swims just behind the female, chasing away rival males. The female will spawn 200 to 300 eggs and scatter them on plants and the substrate. It may eat its own eggs and small fry. The eggs hatch in one to two days and the fry are free-swimming after two more days. After five weeks, the hatchlings will be about 1 cm. long and easily identifiable as cherry barbs.

<doc id="623055" wikidata="Q692573" url="?curid=623055" title="Cold turkey">
<text>Cold turkey refers to the abrupt cessation of substance use in the context of substance dependence, as opposed to gradually easing the process through reduction over time or by using replacement medication. Sudden withdrawal from drugs such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates can be extremely dangerous, leading to potentially fatal seizures. For long-term alcoholics, going cold turkey can cause life-threatening delirium tremens. In the case of opioid withdrawal, going &quot;cold turkey&quot; is extremely unpleasant but less dangerous. Life-threatening issues are unlikely unless one has a pre-existing medical condition.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the phrase &quot;cold turkey&quot; in the sense of unpleasant withdrawal is a matter of some debate and ambiguity.

=== Reaction to being served cheap meat ===
Scholars of 19th-century British periodicals have pointed to the UK satirical magazine &quot;Judy&quot; as the catalyst of the evolution in the phrase&#x27;s meaning. The journal&#x27;s issue of January 3, 1877, featured the fictional diary of one John Humes, Esquire, a Scrooge-like miser who disapproves of Christmas. When Hume is invited to stay at his cousin Clara&#x27;s as a part of her household&#x27;s celebrations, he is shocked to be served slices of cold turkey on the evening of his arrival. That cold turkey is poor substitute for the roasted and dressed dish is played for comic effect. The dissatisfied barrister stays several days nonetheless, and with each passing day, he is more and more shocked to be served cold turkey each day. The story ends with Hume, disgusted at having been treated so badly, removing Clara from his will and testament.

The hypothesis posited by researchers is that Hume&#x27;s behavior towards Clara - excluding and excommunicating her in retaliation for her ongoing ill-treatment of him - became known as &quot;the cold turkey treatment&quot;, and that word quickly spread from London to the rest of Britain, and finally the United States.

An early print appearance of &quot;cold turkey&quot; in its exclusionary sense dates to 1910, in Canadian poet Robert W. Service&#x27;s &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98: A Northland Romance&quot;: &quot;Once I used to gamble an&#x27; drink the limit. One morning I got up from the card-table after sitting there thirty-six hours. I&#x27;d lost five thousand dollars. I knew they&#x27;d handed me out &#x27;cold turkey&#x27;...&quot;

===&quot;Talking turkey&quot;===

Another possible origin relates to the American phrase &quot;talk turkey&quot;, meaning &quot;to speak bluntly with little preparation&quot;. The phrase &quot;taking cold turkey&quot; has also been reported during the 1920s as slang for pleading guilty.

===Goosebumps===

The term is also attributed to piloerection or &quot;goose bumps&quot; that occurs with abrupt withdrawal from opioids, which resembles the skin of a plucked refrigerated turkey. 

The similar term &quot;kick the habit&quot; alludes to the muscle spasms that occur in addition to goosebumps in some cases.

==Usage==
A term appears in its contemporary usage in a December 1920 New York City medical bulletin:
 Another early printed use, this one in the media to refer to drug withdrawal occurred in the &quot;Daily Colonist&quot; in British Columbia in 1921:

The Plastic Ono Band released the song &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; in 1969, which was lyrically inspired from brief heroin addictions endured by John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

<text>The Welsh Football League (also known as the Nathaniel Car Sales Welsh Football League for sponsorship reasons) was a club football league in Wales. For its final season in 2019–20 season it operated at levels 3 and 4 of the Welsh football league system. Level 3 – the Welsh Football League Division One and level 4 Welsh Football League Division Two. It folded in 2020 after the Football Association of Wales took over the running of tier 3 leagues and the responsibility for tier 4 passed to regional football associations.

The Welsh Football League&#x27;s history stretches back to 1904 when the competition was first formed and Aberdare were crowned first champions of a seven-team First Division. Abergavenny were champions of Division 2 and Trelewis the winners of Division 3.

==The first season in 1904–05==
In April 1904, the Merthyr Express newspaper reported that a new football league would be formed in addition to the South Wales League which had been in existence since 1891.

This new competition would be named the Rhymney Valley League and the reason for its creation was due to the South Wales League being overly dominated by Cardiff clubs, though the number of teams from Cardiff barely numbered more than a couple in any one season.

==Structure==
Division One of the League operated at the second tier of the Welsh system, until 2019–20, when it was replaced at that tier by the FAW Championship.

==Former divisions==
* Welsh Football League Division One
* Welsh Football League Division Two

<doc id="623058" wikidata="Q2204179" url="?curid=623058" title="Llandeilo">
<text>Llandeilo () is a town and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales, situated at the crossing of the River Towy by the A483 on a 19th-century stone bridge. At the 2021 the community had a population of 1,784. It is adjacent to the westernmost point of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The town is served by Llandeilo railway station on the Heart of Wales Line.

In 2021, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called the town one of the top six places to live in Wales. The newspaper praised the town as a ‘sophisticated shopping destination and a great showcase for local arts and crafts’.

==History==
===Early history===
Roman soldiers were active in the area around Llandeilo around AD74, as evidenced by the foundations of two castra discovered on the grounds of the Dinefwr estate. The fortifications measured 3.85 hectares and 1.54 hectares, respectively. Roman roads linked Llandeilo with Llandovery and Carmarthen. A small civil settlement developed outside the gates of the fort and may have continued in use as the embryonic town after the Romans left in around AD120.

Llandeilo is named after one of the better-known Celtic saints of the 6th century, Saint Teilo. The Welsh word &quot;llan&quot; signified a monastery or a church. Saint Teilo, who was a contemporary of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, established a &quot;clas&quot; (a small monastic settlement) on the site of the present-day parish church. There is reasonable evidence to suggest, however, that Saint Teilo was buried in Llandeilo. The parish church of Llandeilo Fawr (&quot;Great Llandeilo&quot;) is dedicated to Saint Teilo, and until 1880 its churchyard encompassed his baptistery.

The early Christian settlement that developed around the Saint Teilo&#x27;s Church prospered, and by the early 9th century it had attained considerable ecclesiastical status as the seat of a Bishop-Abbot. The Church of St Teilo soon became a &#x27;mother church&#x27; to the surrounding district, acquiring an extensive estate, and possessing one of Wales&#x27; most beautiful and finely illustrated manuscripts – the &quot;Gospel Book of Saint Teilo&quot;. The discovery of fragments of two large Celtic crosses from this period provides further testimony to Llandeilo&#x27;s importance and indeed prestige as an early ecclesiastical centre. Towards the end of the 9th century, the importance of Llandeilo as a spiritual centre had started to decline.

Dinefwr Castle (anglicised as Dynevor) overlooks the River Tywi near the town. It lies on a ridge on the northern bank of the Tywi, with a steep drop of about to the river. Dinefwr was the chief seat of the kingdom of Deheubarth.

The estate of Golden Grove lies near the town, and further away, the impressive Carreg Cennen Castle, another Welsh stronghold. The remains of Talley Abbey can be seen away to the north of the town. further north are the remains of the Roman Dolaucothi Gold Mines.

===Medieval period===

In the centuries that followed the Norman conquest of England, the Bishop of Llandaff and Bishop of St David&#x27;s both claimed Llandeilo for their respective diocese. By the early 12th century, Llandeilo came under the patronage of the Bishopric of St David&#x27;s, an ecclesiastic borough that became responsible for the affairs of the town including its development as an important medieval market centre to an extensive agricultural hinterland. Until the middle of the 20th century, a fair called St. Teilo&#x27;s Fair, which had been authorised initially by Edward I of England in 1291, was held annually in the churchyard. Some of the agricultural produce and other goods offered for sale are recorded to have been displayed on the tombstones. 

The town was put to the torch during Owain Glyndwr&#x27;s march through the Tywi Valley in July 1403. Nearby Carreg Cennen Castle was besieged by Yorkist forces in 1461 during the Wars of the Roses and partially demolished. 

===Early modern period to the present===
At the Reformation, the town was at the centre of the parish known as Llandeilo Fawr. It was in the Diocese of St Davids and part of the archdeaconry of Carmarthen. In 1560, the bishop of St Davids recorded the population of Llandeilo Fawr as 620 households (perhaps amounting to 2,790 people), many of whom would have lived in Llandeilo itself. 

In the middle of the seventeenth century, Llandeilo was in the area of influence of the royalist general Sir Henry Vaughan. A royalist skirmish took place in the town in April 1648, defeating elements of the New Model Army.

In 1887, John Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; described Llandeilo as having a population of 1,533. He observed that “the principal trade of the town is in corn and flour; the other industries include woollen cloth mills, timber and saw mills, and tanneries”.

The road and railway bridges over the Tywi are of engineering interest. The single-arched Llandeilo Bridge was completed in 1848 and is Grade II* listed. The railway bridge, opened in 1852, is a rare survival of an early lattice truss bridge.

In the Great Storm of 1987, the floods were so severe that the River Tywi (Towy) overwhelmed the railway bridge crossing the river near Llandeilo. Four people, one of them a boy, were drowned when the 05:27 train from Swansea to Shrewsbury plunged off the damaged Glanrhyd Bridge into the river.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Llandeilo, at community (town) and county level: Llandeilo Fawr Town Council (Cyngor Tref Llandeilo Fawr) and Carmarthenshire County Council (Cyngor Sir Gâr). The town council is based at Hengwrt (Old Courthouse) at 8 Carmarthen Street, being the former Shire Hall, built in 1802.

The Llandeilo community is bordered by the communities of: Manordeilo and Salem; Dyffryn Cennen; Llanfihangel Aberbythych; and Llangathen, all being in Carmarthenshire.

===Administrative history===
Llandeilo historically formed part of the parish of Llandeilo Fawr, which also included extensive rural areas north and south of the town itself. In 1859, a local government district called Llandilo was established covering the central part of the parish around the town itself. Such local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so that part of the parish outside the urban district became a separate parish called Llandeilo Fawr Rural.

The official spelling of the name of the urban district was &#x27;Llandilo&#x27; until 1957, when it was changed to &#x27;Llandeilo&#x27; to better reflect modern Welsh orthography.

Llandeilo Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Llandeilo was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. Although the community name is officially just Llandeilo, its community council calls itself Llandeilo Fawr Town Council. District-level functions passed to Dinefwr Borough Council. Carmarthenshire County Council was abolished as part of the same reforms, with county-level functions passing to the new Dyfed County Council. Dinefwr and Dyfed were both abolished in 1996 and their councils&#x27; functions passed to a re-established Carmarthenshire County Council.

The parish of Llandeilo Fawr Rural also became a community in 1974; it was abolished in 1987, being divided between the communities of Cwmamman, Manordeilo and Salem, and Dyffryn Cennen. At the same time, the community of Llandeilo was enlarged to take in the area of the abolished community of Llandyfeisant west of the town, which brought Dinefwr Castle and its grounds into the community of Llandeilo.

==Sports and recreation==

Llandeilo has two main parks: Penlan Park and Parc Le Conquet. Penlan Park contains a bandstand and a woodland walk to the Dinefwr estate. Parc Le Conquet is home to the town’s bowls club. 

The town has several sports clubs. The local rugby union team is Llandeilo RFC, which was one of the founding clubs of the Welsh Rugby Union. The town is also home to Llandeilo Town AFC, an association football club currently playing in the Carmarthenshire League. Llandeilo Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1908/9. The club and course disappeared in the late 1960s. The town also has a thriving cricket club that fields a male, female and junior teams.

The town hosted a celebrity football event that took place between 2015 and 2017 to help raise funds for Ty Hafan children&#x27;s hospice. Celebrities who took part in the event included EastEnders actor Matt Lapinskas, Former Blackburn &amp; Scotland defender Colin Hendry, Big Brother runner-up Glyn Wise, former Wales rugby player Mark Taylor, and Everton &amp; Wales legend Neville Southall. The event helped raise over £4,500 for the hospice.

In 2008 Llandeilo hosted the World Sheepdog Trials.

== Llandeilo relief road ==
The amount of traffic coming into the town has caused considerable debate. In 2020, town mayor, Owen James, said “As it stands it’s simply dangerous for people to come into Llandeilo. I know of people who don’t want to come into Llandeilo for that reason. Stand on the main road – you know exactly why we need a bypass.” Work on a bypass road was scheduled to begin in 2019, directing traffic around the town. Commencement of construction work has been delayed. A freeze on construction of new roads in Wales did not include the bypass, which the Welsh Government has estimated to cost £50m.

A final decision on how best to proceed with the bypass was scheduled for the autumn of 2022, but was delayed until later in the winter.

<doc id="623060" wikidata="Q1196223" url="?curid=623060" title="Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, owned and operated by Tokyo Metro. The line was named after the Hibiya area in Chiyoda&#x27;s Yurakucho district, under which it passes. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color silver, and its stations are given numbers using the letter &quot;H&quot;.

==Overview==

The Hibiya Line runs between in Meguro and in Adachi. The line&#x27;s path is somewhat similar to that of the Ginza Line; however, the Hibiya Line was designed to serve a number of important districts, such as Ebisu, Roppongi, Tsukiji, Kayabachō and Senju, which were not on an existing line.

The Hibiya Line became the first line operated by Tokyo Metro to offer through services with a private railway, and the second Tokyo subway line overall after the Toei Asakusa Line. It is connected to the Tobu Skytree Line at , and through services operate between Naka-Meguro and on the Tobu Skytree Line, and onward to on the Tobu Nikko Line. Some peak-hour services terminate at , or on the Tobu Skytree Line. Despite its name, the through service does not stop anywhere near the Tokyo Skytree.

The line is the first subway line overall to use narrow gauge (as previous lines used standard gauge), and all subsequent lines operated by Tokyo Metro were built to this gauge to accommodate through services. (Of all subway lines built since the Hibiya Line, only the Asakusa, Shinjuku, and Ōedo lines were not built to this gauge.)

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Hibiya Line is the eighth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, running at 164% capacity between Minowa and Iriya stations.

On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color silver, and its stations are numbered with the prefix &quot;H&quot;.

As the old trains which have mixture of three and five doors per car have been retired, platform gates are now being installed as of 14 April 2020 with unified door arrangements of four doors per car. This also reflects with the reduction of eight-car train to seven-car trainset due to the longer per car trainset instead of the older per car trainset, which resulted in 1% reduction in capacity per train.

A reserved seat limited stop liner service known as the TH Liner commenced service since 6 June 2020 and stop at selected stations along the Hibiya Line and the Tobu lines.

==History==
The Hibiya Line was the fourth subway line built in Tokyo after the Ginza Line, Marunouchi Line, and Toei Asakusa Line.

Its basic plan was drawn up by a Ministry of Transportation committee in 1957. Called &quot;Line 2&quot; at the time, it was designed to connect Naka-Meguro in southwest Tokyo with Kita-Koshigaya in the northeast. The full northeastern extension of the line was never built, as the Tobu Railway upgraded to quadruple track within the same corridor to meet capacity demands.

Work began in 1959, with the original section from Minami-Senju to Naka-okachimachi Station opening in March 1961. The line opened in stages: the northern section was operational in May 1962 between Kita-Senju and Ningyōchō and in February 1963 between Ningyōchō and Higashi-ginza; the southern section, between Naka-Meguro and Kasumigaseki, opened in March 1964.

The final segment, bridging Higashi-Ginza and Kasumigaseki, opened on 29 August 1964, just weeks before the opening ceremony for the 1964 Summer Olympics. Through service to the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line also began operations on this date. This was something of a coup for the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (the predecessor of today&#x27;s Tokyo Metro), as the Toei Asakusa Line, which was also to be completed in time for the Olympics, had fallen behind schedule and remained under construction for the duration of the Games.

The Hibiya Line was one of the lines targeted in the 1995 Aum sarin gas attack.

On 8 March 2000, five people were killed and 63 were injured when a derailed Hibiya Line train was sideswiped by a second train near Naka-Meguro Station.

The line, station facilities, rolling stock, and other assets were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

16 March 2013 marked the end of through service with Tōkyū Tōyoko Line. All Hibiya Line trains now terminate Naka-Meguro Station.

<text>&quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; is a short story by Stephen King published as part of his 1978 short story collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;. Unlike most other stories in this book, &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; had been previously unpublished until February 1978 under Doubleday Publishing. It was featured in Edward D. Hoch&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Best detective stories of the year&quot; collection. The plot follows Dick Morrison&#x27;s discovery of the brutal enforcement methods used by Quitters, Inc., the firm which he enlists to aid him quit smoking. Like much of Stephen King&#x27;s work, this short story exhibits elements of horror fiction and gothic fiction. The tale was adapted in the 1985 American anthology horror film &quot;Cat’s Eye&quot;.

== Plot ==
Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Morrison, a middle-aged smoker, is at John F. Kennedy International Airport when he encounters Jimmy McCann, his old college roommate and advertisement agency coworker. McCann, who had been a heavy smoker in college, credits a firm called Quitters, Inc. for helping him give it up and recommends that Dick try their services. The firm has a 98% success rate and guarantees that the person will quit smoking forever. Dick, who works in advertising, is reluctant as he has never seen this firm advertised in billboards or print media, to which McCann says it is a small firm with all the clients they can handle solely by word of mouth. Before leaving, McCann gives a business card to Dick.

A month later, when Dick is not happy in his job, he resorts to drinking, and Jimmy McCann&#x27;s business card falls out of Dick&#x27;s wallet when he pays the bartender. As the address is close to the bar, Dick decides to go to Quitters, Inc. on a whim. Dick is introduced to Victor Donatti, who will be his quitting counselor. Donatti tells the history of Quitters, Inc., that it was founded by a New Jersey mob boss who had been a heavy smoker and realized, before he died of lung cancer, that he must aid others in quitting. Dick is still uneasy, especially as Donatti asks many questions about the Morrison family without revealing the methods used.

The following day, Donatti states to Morrison that they have found out all the relevant information about his family. Although Donatti assures Morrison that Quitters, Inc. holds clients&#x27; personal information in the strictest confidence, Dick is disgusted and shocked at what has been discovered. Donatti then shows Dick their method: aversion training, demonstrated by electrocuting a rabbit so it would be trained not to eat. Donatti warns Dick that he will be under surveillance and if he is caught smoking, Dick&#x27;s family will be sent to the &quot;rabbit room&quot;.

For the first month, Dick will have round-the-clock surveillance to ensure he is not smoking, and for the second and third months, the surveillance drops down to 18 hours a day (&quot;but you will never know &quot;which&quot; eighteen&quot;, cautions Donatti). During the fourth month (when relapses often occur) the surveillance goes back up to 24 hours. From the fifth month until one year in the program, the surveillance will be reduced to 12 hours a day. After that, the surveillance consists of random checks for the remainder of his life. The brutal enforcement methods used by Quitters, Inc. are non-fatal electric shocks of increasing intensity to his wife, Cindy, a second infraction to him, and the third the both of them. A fourth infraction would involve beatings to his son, and subsequent infractions would result in more trips to the shock room with higher voltage, and more painful beatings of his son and wife. After the ninth infraction, his son&#x27;s arms would be broken. Finally, if Dick commits a 10th infraction, he would be shot dead, with Donatti remarking &quot;he would become part of the unregenerate 2%&quot;. He ends by showing Dick a gun and affirming the guarantee that even the 2% &quot;would never smoke again&quot;.

Donatti says that Morrison should not worry too much about the torture, as 40% of Quitters, Inc. clients never violate the agreement at all, and only 10% are subject to a fourth or greater infraction. Donatti says Morrison&#x27;s greatest problem will probably be temptation as a result of availability, as there is a newspaper stand in the lobby of the very building Quitters, Inc. is situated, and they sell all cigarette brands. Dick&#x27;s desire to relapse is overcome by fear of the surveillance and torture, which he conceals from his wife in order not to frighten her.

Months go by, and Dick is faithful to his resolve to quit smoking, even during a point when he drank excessively at a party; he is still sober enough to decline an offer for a smoke. He gradually loses the physical jitters of quitting, but the psychological craving for tobacco stays strong. One day during a stressful traffic jam, Dick&#x27;s desire overtakes him, and he finds an old pack of cigarettes in the glove compartment, lights a cigarette, but stubs it out after only three drags. After the traffic clears, Dick comes home to an empty house and a call from Donatti informing him that they have his wife. Dick heads to Quitters, Inc. only to be restrained by a Mafia enforcer and watches as Cindy is shocked at a low setting. After the shocking, Dick speaks with Cindy in private, who is forgiving and supportive that, according to her, Donatti has &quot;let him out of a prison&quot;.

Shortly after the shocking, Dick has gained weight, and Donatti obtains some prohibited diet pills for him to achieve a target weight. If Dick strays from this goal, Donatti threatens that his wife&#x27;s right little finger will be cut off. Morrison exercises and keeps in shape, and gives the business card to a , echoing the start of the story. The story ends when Dick and Cindy meet the McCanns, and Dick realizes that Jimmy&#x27;s wife is missing her little finger on her right hand.

== Style and themes ==
Stephen King connects his classic horror style with humor in &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, as he tells the story of how the threat of radical punishment can curb smoking addiction quickly. The names of the main characters of the text, Dick Morrison and Jimmy McCann refer to the tobacco company Philip Morris and the advertising company, McCann. The story portrays the upper-middle-class in the late 1970s, particularly the way in which smoking was widespread in popular culture. When King was writing this story, the movement to quit smoking was starting to become increasingly popular in the United States. This began with the affluent in upper management roles who, like King, could ‘afford’ the effort to quit smoking. Although King previously wrote about blue-collar characters, there is a shift here in &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, where King explores the horrors of the upper class.

Dr. Katherine Hawley says that through the tale, Stephen King questions how social accountability strategies raise ethical dilemmas around self-control. She writes that outright promises and contracts generate new moral obligations, and when we put other people&#x27;s interests on the line, we must be realistic about our prospects of success. The formalization of this by promising, like Morrison does to Donatti, adds an ethical dimension. This is to say that, in &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, even if Morrison succeeds in quitting, the danger he places his family in is morally abhorrent and outrageous, Hawley says.

Quitters, Inc. has been utilized to discuss approach to communication of characters in modern American literature. According to Dr. Tatjana Rusko, Mr. Donatti uses an emotional approach to impression management when attempting to intimidate Morrison. She says that when Morrison is at Quitters, Inc. for the first time, Mr. Donatti&#x27;s speech is unshakable and persuasive. He uses an assertive tone and repetition of the personal pronoun ‘we’ to present a desired image and, as Rusko writes, a hypnotic effect. She writes that the reference to the well-known guru Dale Carnegie is a hook that Mr. Donatti uses to manipulate Morrison.

Mark Browning says that &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; can be more accurately described as a story of the unexpected. He also draws a link between this story and Roald Dahl’s 1954 story &quot;Man from the South&quot;, especially as both feature the wife of a minor character having her pinky cut off.

Tony Magistrale says that King&#x27;s fiction is largely satirical in nature, that &quot;reveals a collective cultural fears and fantasies which go unspoken in everyday life&quot;. He writes that Stephen King&#x27;s work mostly aims to critique a loss of dignity through a lack of self-control and powerlessness. Ben P. Idick says that the terror of King&#x27;s works, like &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, is that he combines fear and realism.

== Autobiographical elements ==

Stephen King has criticized psychoanalysis several times throughout his career. King tries to convey the evil of behavioral psychology specialists from his point of view, says Dr. Lenore C. Terr. She says that King developed his childhood fear of psychiatry despite the possibility that it could have helped him. In &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, this manifests in the terrifying addiction counselor Vincent Donatti and the satire of self-improvement &quot;guru&quot; Dale Carnegie. This is similar to another story in &quot;Night Shift&quot;, &quot;The Boogeyman&quot;, where a boogeyman that has murdered three young children disguises itself as a psychiatrist. Additionally, as King suffered from insomnia and nightmares in his youth, Terr says that he translated these nightmares to others through his horror fiction.

In the early 1970s, King developed a severe alcohol addiction that would persist for more than a decade. His addiction to alcohol, drugs and cigarettes was so severe that King says he barely recalls writing his 1981 novel &quot;Cujo&quot;. Like Dick Morrison in &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, Stephen King was dependent on nicotine for decades. He thought of cigarettes as a stimulant for his imagination and says that quitting smoking caused his writing to &quot;slow down&quot;. As a result of this lifelong struggle, addiction was a key theme that appeared in several of King&#x27;s works, notably &quot;Misery&quot; (1987) and &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; (1978).

== Adaptations ==

=== &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1985) ===
&quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; was adapted onto the big screen in the 1985 anthology horror film &quot;Cat’s Eye&quot;, alongside &quot;The Ledge&quot; and &quot;General&quot;. This dramatization features James Woods as Dick Morrison, and Alan King as Dr. Vincent Donatti, produced by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Like the other adaptations, this film downplays the horror from the original, by elevating the humour in the work. The film opens in New York with a cat having escaped and is captured by an agent for Quitters, Inc. The main difference between the adaptation is the replacement of the rabbit from the original text with a cat, which like the rabbit, is later electrocuted to disturb Morrison  The film ends just like the text, with the threat that if Morrison compensates for smoking with overeating, his wife&#x27;s little finger will be cut off. Moving onto Atlantic City, the cat is adopted by Cressner, a gangster who has just become aware of his wife&#x27;s affair (the beginning of &quot;The Ledge&quot;)

In &quot;Cat’s Eye&quot;, Morrison&#x27;s attempt to smoke secretly leads to a chain of horror clichés; thunder and lightning, creeping around the house at night, a shocking glimpse in his own reflection and a golf bag that jumps out at Morrison from a wardrobe. In one scene, a party that is full of cigarette smoke leads to vivid hallucinations and surrealism where Morrison sees a strange figure sit on the couch and exhale smoke slowly. The final scene, in which we get a close-up of Jerry&#x27;s wife&#x27;s missing finger, is when we receive confirmation that Morrison&#x27;s experiences were real, Mark Browning says.

Other adaptations: 
* Bollywood film &quot;No Smoking&quot; (2007) : a neo-noir psychological thriller that is based on &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot; The plot follows K (John Abraham), a chain smoker who agrees to quit smoking to save his marriage by attending a rehabilitation center but is trapped by Baba Bengali (Paresh Rawal) who is sure to make him quit.
*“Bigalow’s Last Smoke” (1985) an episode of &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;: Mr. Bigalow, a chain smoker, wakes up to find himself trapped in a replica of his own apartment. A mysterious figure appears on the television screen which subjects him to endurance tests in order to force him to quit smoking, which pushes him to the edge of sanity. When he recovers, he finds he has no interest in smoking at all, only to be confronted by the figure about his addiction to caffeine, and that now they are going to treat him for that.

<text>Rev. Henry William Watson FRS (25 February 1827, Marylebone, London11 January 1903, Brighton) was a mathematician and author of a number of mathematics books. He was an ordained priest and Cambridge Apostle.

==Life==
Watson was born at Marylebone on 25 Feb. 1827, the son of Thomas Watson, R.N., and Eleanor Mary Kingston.

He was educated at King&#x27;s College London and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated as second wrangler and Smith&#x27;s prizeman in 1850, Dr. W. H. Besant being senior wrangler. 
In 1851 he became fellow of Trinity college, and from 1851 to 1853 was assistant tutor there. Watson formed a close friendship with James Fitzjames Stephen, who entered Trinity in 1847. From 1853 he was mathematical master in the City of London School, and in 1857 he became mathematical lecturer at King′s College.

Watson was ordained deacon in 1856, and two years later received priest′s orders. He was an assistant master at Harrow School from 1857 to 1865, when he became rector of Berkswell near Coventry. He kept this position for 37 years, resigning in August 1902, when he moved to Brighton. His time at the rectory provided ample time to pursue mathematical and scientific studies, and he was a frequent contributor to scientific literature.

He and Francis Galton introduced the Galton–Watson process in 1875. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1881, and took the degree D.Sc. in 1883.

He died in Brighton on 11 January 1903.

==Books by H. W. Watson==
* The mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism (Volume 1: electrostatics) (Clarendon, Oxford, 1885–1889) 
* The mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism (Volume 2: magnetism &amp; electrodynamics) (Clarendon, Oxford, 1885–1889)
* A treatise on the application of generalised coordinates to the kinetics of a material system (Clarendon, Oxford, 1879) 
* A treatise on the kinetic theory of gases (Clarendon, Oxford, 1893)

<doc id="623068" wikidata="Q3273595" url="?curid=623068" title="Foreach loop">
<text>In computer programming, foreach loop (or for-each loop) is a control flow statement for traversing items in a collection. is usually used in place of a standard loop statement. Unlike other loop constructs, however, loops usually maintain no explicit counter: they essentially say &quot;do this to everything in this set&quot;, rather than &quot;do this times&quot;. This avoids potential off-by-one errors and makes code simpler to read. In object-oriented languages, an iterator, even if implicit, is often used as the means of traversal.

The statement in some languages has some defined order, processing each item in the collection from the first to the last.
The statement in many other languages, especially array programming languages, does not have any particular order. This simplifies loop optimization in general and in particular allows vector processing of items in the collection concurrently.

== Syntax ==
Syntax varies among languages. Most use the simple word codice_1, although other use the more logical word codice_2, roughly as follows:

 foreach(key, value) in collection {
 # Do something to value #

== Language support ==
Programming languages which support foreach loops include ABC, ActionScript, Ada, C++ (since C++11), C#, ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML), Cobra, D, Daplex (query language), Delphi, ECMAScript, Erlang, Java (since 1.5), JavaScript, Lua, Objective-C (since 2.0), ParaSail, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, REALbasic, Rebol, Red, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, Swift, Tcl, tcsh, Unix shells, Visual Basic (.NET), and Windows PowerShell. Notable languages without foreach are C, and C++ pre-C++11.

=== ActionScript 3.0 ===
ActionScript supports the ECMAScript 4.0 Standard for codice_3 which pulls the value at each index.
var foo:Object = {
 &quot;apple&quot;:1,
 &quot;orange&quot;:2

for each (var value:int in foo) { 
 trace(value); 

// returns &quot;1&quot; then &quot;2&quot;
It also supports codice_4 which pulls the key at each index.
for (var key:String in foo) { 
 trace(key); 

// returns &quot;apple&quot; then &quot;orange&quot;
=== Ada ===

Ada supports foreach loops as part of the normal for loop. Say X is an array:
for I in X&#x27;Range loop
 X (I) := Get_Next_Element;
end loop;
This syntax is used on mostly arrays, but will also work with other types when a full iteration is needed.

Ada 2012 has generalized loops to foreach loops on any kind of container (array, lists, maps...):
for Obj of X loop
 -- Work on Obj
end loop;
=== C ===
The C language does not have collections or a foreach construct. However, it has several standard data structures that can be used as collections, and foreach can be made easily with a macro.

However, two obvious problems occur:
* The macro is unhygienic: it declares a new variable in the existing scope which remains after the loop.
* One foreach macro cannot be defined that works with different collection types (e.g., array and linked list) or that is extensible to user types.

C string as a collection of char

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* foreach macro viewing a string as a collection of char values */
#define foreach(ptrvar, strvar) \
char* ptrvar; \
for (ptrvar = strvar; (*ptrvar) != &#x27;\0&#x27;; *ptrvar++)

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 char* s1 = &quot;abcdefg&quot;;
 char* s2 = &quot;123456789&quot;;
 foreach (p1, s1) {
 printf(&quot;loop 1: %c\n&quot;, *p1);
 foreach (p2, s2) {
 printf(&quot;loop 2: %c\n&quot;, *p2);
 return 0;


C int array as a collection of int (array size known at compile-time)

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* foreach macro viewing an array of int values as a collection of int values */
#define foreach(intpvar, intarr) \
int* intpvar; \
for (intpvar = intarr; intpvar &lt; (intarr + (sizeof(intarr)/sizeof(intarr[0]))); ++intpvar)

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 int a1[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8};
 int a2[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
 foreach (p1, a1) {
 printf(&quot;loop 1: %d\n&quot;, *p1);
 foreach (p2, a2) {
 printf(&quot;loop 2: %d\n&quot;, *p2);
 return 0;


Most general: string or array as collection (collection size known at run-time)
: &quot; can be removed and codice_5 used in its place with GCC&quot;

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

/* foreach macro viewing an array of given type as a collection of values of given type */
#define arraylen(arr) (sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]))
#define foreach(idxtype, idxpvar, col, colsiz) \
idxtype* idxpvar; \
for (idxpvar = col; idxpvar &lt; (col + colsiz); ++idxpvar)

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 char* c1 = &quot;collection&quot;;
 int c2[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
 double* c3;
 int c3len = 4;
 c3 = (double*)calloc(c3len, sizeof(double)); 
 c3[0] = 1.2; c3[1] = 3.4; c3[2] = 5.6; c3[3] = 7.8;

 foreach (char, p1, c1, strlen(c1)) {
 printf(&quot;loop 1: %c\n&quot;, *p1);
 foreach (int, p2, c2, arraylen(c2)) {
 printf(&quot;loop 2: %d\n&quot;, *p2);
 foreach (double, p3, c3, c3len) {
 printf(&quot;loop 3: %.1lf\n&quot;, *p3);
 return 0;


=== C# ===
In C#, assuming that myArray is an array of integers:

foreach (int x in myArray) { Console.WriteLine(x); }

Language Integrated Query (LINQ) provides the following syntax, accepting a delegate or lambda expression:

myArray.ToList().ForEach(x =&gt; Console.WriteLine(x));

=== C++ ===
C++11 provides a foreach loop. The syntax is similar to that of Java:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
 int myint[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

 for (int i : myint)
 std::cout « i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
}
C++11 range-based for statements have been implemented in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) (since version 4.6), Clang (since version 3.0) and Visual C++ 2012 (version 11 )

The range-based codice_1 is syntactic sugar equivalent to:
 for (auto __anon = begin(myint); __anon != end(myint); ++__anon)
 auto i = *__anon;
 std::cout « i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;


The compiler uses argument-dependent lookup to resolve the codice_7 and codice_8 functions.

The C++ Standard Library also supports codice_9, that applies each element to a function, which can be any predefined function or a lambda expression. While range-based for is only from the start to the end, the range or direction can be changed by altering the first two parameters.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // contains std::for_each
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main()
 std::vector&lt;int&gt; v {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

 std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int i)
 std::cout « i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;

 std::cout « &quot;reversed but skip 2 elements:\n&quot;;

 std::for_each(v.rbegin()+2, v.rend(), [](int i)
 std::cout « i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
}
Qt, a C++ framework, offers a macro providing foreach loops using the STL iterator interface:
#include &lt;QList&gt;
#include &lt;QDebug&gt;

int main()
 QList&lt;int&gt; list;

 list « 1 « 2 « 3 « 4 « 5;

 foreach (int i, list)
 qDebug() « i;
}

Boost, a set of free peer-reviewed portable C++ libraries also provides foreach loops:
#include &lt;boost/foreach.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
 int myint[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 BOOST_FOREACH(int &amp;i, myint)
 std::cout « i « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
}
=== C++/CLI ===
The C++/CLI language proposes a construct similar to C#.

Assuming that myArray is an array of integers:
for each (int x in myArray)
 Console::WriteLine(x);


=== ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) ===
==== Script syntax ====

// arrays
arrayeach([1,2,3,4,5], function(v){
 writeOutput(v);

// or

for (v in [1,2,3,4,5]){
 writeOutput(v);

// or

// (Railo only; not supported in ColdFusion)
letters = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;];
letters.each(function(v){
 writeOutput(v); // abcde

// structs
for (k in collection){
 writeOutput(collection[k]);

// or

structEach(collection, function(k,v){
 writeOutput(&quot;key: #k#, value: #v#;&quot;);

// or
// (Railo only; not supported in ColdFusion)
collection.each(function(k,v){
 writeOutput(&quot;key: #k#, value: #v#;&quot;);


==== Tag syntax ====

&lt;!--- arrays ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop index=&quot;v&quot; array=&quot;#[&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;,&#x27;d&#x27;,&#x27;e&#x27;]#&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfoutput&gt;#v#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;!--- a b c d e ---&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;

CFML incorrectly identifies the value as &quot;index&quot; in this construct; the codice_10 variable does receive the actual value of the array element, not its index.
&lt;!--- structs ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop item=&quot;k&quot; collection=&quot;#collection#&quot;&gt;
 &lt;cfoutput&gt;#collection[k]#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
=== Common Lisp ===
Common Lisp provides foreach ability either with the &quot;dolist&quot; macro:

(dolist (i &#x27;(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17))
 (print i))

or the powerful &quot;loop&quot; macro to iterate on more data types

(loop for i in &#x27;(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17)
 do (print i))
and even with the &quot;mapcar&quot; function:

(mapcar #&#x27;print &#x27;(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17))
=== D ===
foreach(item; set) {
 // do something to item


or
foreach(argument) {
 // pass value


=== Dart ===
for (final element in someCollection) {
 // do something with element


=== Object Pascal, Delphi ===

Foreach support was added in Delphi 2005, and uses an enumerator variable that must be declared in the &quot;var&quot; section.
for enumerator in collection do
begin
 //do something here
end;
=== Eiffel ===
The iteration (foreach) form of the Eiffel loop construct is introduced by the keyword codice_11.

In this example, every element of the structure codice_12 is printed:
 across my_list as ic loop print (ic.item) end
The local entity codice_13 is an instance of the library class codice_14. The cursor&#x27;s feature codice_15 provides access to each structure element. Descendants of class codice_14 can be created to handle specialized iteration algorithms. The types of objects that can be iterated across (codice_12 in the example) are based on classes that inherit from the library class codice_18.

The iteration form of the Eiffel loop can also be used as a boolean expression when the keyword codice_19 is replaced by either codice_20 (effecting universal quantification) or codice_21 (effecting existential quantification).

This iteration is a boolean expression which is true if all items in codice_12 have counts greater than three:
 across my_list as ic all ic.item.count &gt; 3 end
The following is true if at least one item has a count greater than three:
 across my_list as ic some ic.item.count &gt; 3 end
=== Go ===
Go&#x27;s foreach loop can be used to loop over an array, slice, string, map, or channel.

Using the two-value form gets the index/key (first element) and the value (second element):

for index, value := range someCollection {
 // Do something to index and value


Using the one-value form gets the index/key (first element):

for index := range someCollection {
 // Do something to index


=== Groovy ===
Groovy supports &quot;for&quot; loops over collections like arrays, lists and ranges:
def x = [1,2,3,4]
for (v in x) // loop over the 4-element array x
 println v

for (v in [1,2,3,4]) // loop over 4-element literal list 
 println v

for (v in 1..4) // loop over the range 1..4
 println v


Groovy also supports a C-style for loop with an array index:
for (i = 0; i &lt; x.size(); i++)
 println x[i]


Collections in Groovy can also be iterated over using the &quot;each&quot; keyword
and a closure. By default, the loop dummy is named &quot;it&quot;
x.each{ println it } // print every element of the x array
x.each{i-&gt; println i} // equivalent to line above, only loop dummy explicitly named &quot;i&quot;
=== Haskell ===
Haskell allows looping over lists with monadic actions using codice_23 and codice_24 (codice_23 with its arguments flipped) from Control.Monad:

It&#x27;s also possible to generalize those functions to work on applicative functors rather than monads and any data structure that is traversable using codice_26 (codice_1 with its arguments flipped) and codice_28 (codice_29 with its arguments flipped) from Data.Traversable.

=== Haxe ===
for (value in iterable) {
 trace(value);

Lambda.iter(iterable, function(value) trace(value));
=== Java ===
In Java, a foreach-construct was introduced in Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5.0.

Official sources use several names for the construct. It is referred to as the &quot;Enhanced for Loop&quot;, the &quot;For-Each Loop&quot;, and the &quot;foreach statement&quot;.
for (Type item : iterableCollection) {
 // Do something to item


Java also provides the stream api since java 8:

 List&lt;Integer&gt; intList = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4);
 intList.stream().forEach(i -&gt; System.out.println(i));
=== JavaScript ===
In ECMAScript 5, a callback-based codice_30 method was added to the array prototype:
myArray.forEach(function (item, index) {
 // Do stuff with item and index 
 // The index variable can be omitted from the parameter list if not needed
The ECMAScript 6 standard introduced a more conventional codice_31 syntax that works on all iterables rather than operating on only array instances. However, no index variable is available with the syntax.

for (const item of myArray) {
 // Do stuff with item


For unordered iteration over the keys in an object, JavaScript features the codice_32 loop:
for (const key in myObject) {
 // Do stuff with myObject[key]


To limit the iteration to the object&#x27;s own properties, excluding those inherited through the prototype chain, it&#x27;s often useful to add a codice_33 test (or a codice_34 test if supported).

for (const key in myObject) {
 // Available in older browsers
 if (myObject.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
 // Do stuff with object[key]
 // Preferred in modern browsers
 if (Object.hasOwn(myObject, key)) {
 // Do stuff with object[key]
}

Alternatively, the codice_35 method combined with the codice_31 loop can be used for a less verbose way to iterate over the keys of an object.

const book = { 
 name: &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, 
 author: &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; 
for (const key of Object.keys(book)) {
 console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${book[key]}`);


=== Lua ===

Iterate only through numerical index values:
for index, value in ipairs(array) do
 -- do something
end
Iterate through all index values:
for index, value in pairs(array) do
 -- do something
end
=== Mathematica ===
In Mathematica, codice_37 will simply evaluate an expression for each element of a list, without returning any value.
In[]:= Do[doSomethingWithItem, {item, list}]
It is more common to use codice_38, which returns the result of each evaluation in a new list.
In[]:= list = {3, 4, 5};

In[]:= Table[item^2, {item, list}]
Out[]= {9, 16, 25}
=== MATLAB ===
for item = array
%do something
end
=== Mint ===
For each loops are supported in Mint, possessing the following syntax:

for each element of list
 /* &#x27;Do something.&#x27; */
end
The codice_39 or codice_40 infinite loop
in Mint can be written using a for each loop and an infinitely long list.
import type
/* &#x27;This function is mapped to&#x27;
 * &#x27;each index number i of the&#x27;
 * &#x27;infinitely long list.&#x27;
sub identity(x)
 return x
end
/* &#x27;The following creates the list&#x27;
 * &#x27;[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., infinity]&#x27;
infiniteList = list(identity)
for each element of infiniteList
 /* &#x27;Do something forever.&#x27; */
end
=== Objective-C ===
Foreach loops, called Fast enumeration, are supported starting in Objective-C 2.0. They can be used to iterate over any object that implements the NSFastEnumeration protocol, including NSArray, NSDictionary (iterates over keys), NSSet, etc.
NSArray *a = [NSArray new]; // Any container class can be substituted

for(id obj in a) { // Dynamic typing is used. The type of object stored
 // in &#x27;a&#x27; can be unknown. The array can hold many different 
 // types of object.

 printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, [[obj description] UTF8String]); // Must use UTF8String with %s
 NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, obj); // Leave as an object


NSArrays can also broadcast a message to their members:
NSArray *a = [NSArray new];

[a makeObjectsPerformSelector:@selector(printDescription)];
Where [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] are available, an NSArray can automatically perform a block on every contained item:
[myArray enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop)
 NSLog(@&quot;obj %@&quot;, obj);
 if ([obj shouldStopIterationNow])
 *stop = YES;


The type of collection being iterated will dictate the item returned with each iteration.
For example:
NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary new];

for(id key in d) {
 NSObject *obj = [d objectForKey:key]; // We use the (unique) key to access the (possibly nonunique) object.
 NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, obj);


=== OCaml ===
[[OCaml]] is a [[functional programming]] language. Thus, the equivalent of a foreach loop can be achieved as a library function over lists and arrays.

For lists:
List.iter (fun x -&gt; print_int x) [1;2;3;4];; 
or in short way:
List.iter print_int [1;2;3;4];; 
For arrays:
Array.iter (fun x -&gt; print_int x) [|1;2;3;4|];;
or in short way:
Array.iter print_int [|1;2;3;4|];;
=== ParaSail ===
The [[ParaSail (programming language)|ParaSail]] parallel programming language supports several kinds of iterators, including a general &quot;for each&quot; iterator over a container:
var Con : Container&lt;Element_Type&gt; := ...
for each Elem of Con concurrent loop // loop may also be &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;reverse&quot; or unordered (the default)
 // ... do something with Elem
end loop
ParaSail also supports filters on iterators, and the ability to refer to both the key and the value of a map. Here is a forward iteration over the elements of &quot;My_Map&quot; selecting only elements where the keys are in &quot;My_Set&quot;:

var My_Map : Map&lt;Key_Type =&gt; Univ_String, Value_Type =&gt; Tree&lt;Integer» := ...
const My_Set : Set&lt;Univ_String&gt; := [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;ghi&quot;];

for each [Str =&gt; Tr] of My_Map {Str in My_Set} forward loop
 // ... do something with Str or Tr
end loop
=== Pascal ===
In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], ISO standard 10206:1990 introduced iteration over [[Pascal (programming language)#Set types|set types]], thus:
var
 elt: ElementType;
 eltset: set of ElementType;

for elt in eltset do
 { ... do something with elt }
=== Perl ===
In [[Perl]], &quot;foreach&quot; (which is equivalent to the shorter for) can be used to traverse elements of a list. The expression which denotes the collection to loop over is evaluated in list-context and each item of the resulting list is, in turn, aliased to the loop variable.

List literal example:
foreach (1, 2, 3, 4) {
 print $_;


Array examples:
foreach (@arr) {
 print $_;

foreach $x (@arr) { #$x is the element in @arr
 print $x;


Hash example:
foreach $x (keys %hash) {
 print $x . &quot; = &quot; . $hash{$x}; # $x is a key in %hash and $hash{$x} is its value


Direct modification of collection members:
@arr = ( &#x27;remove-foo&#x27;, &#x27;remove-bar&#x27; );
foreach $x (@arr){
 $x =~ s/remove-//;
# Now @arr = (&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;);
=== PHP ===
foreach ($set as $value) {
 // Do something to $value;


It is also possible to extract both keys and values using the alternate syntax:
foreach ($set as $key =&gt; $value) {
 echo &quot;{$key} has a value of {$value}&quot;;


Direct modification of collection members:
$arr = array(1, 2, 3);
foreach ($arr as &amp;$value) { // The &amp;, $value is a reference to the original value inside $arr
 $value++;
// Now $arr = array(2, 3, 4);

// also works with the full syntax
foreach ($arr as $key =&gt; &amp;$value) {
 $value++;

=== Python ===
for item in iterable_collection:
 # Do something with item
Python&#x27;s tuple assignment, fully available in its foreach loop, also makes it trivial to iterate on (key, value) pairs in [[Associative array|dictionaries]]:
for key, value in some_dict.items(): # Direct iteration on a dict iterates on its keys
 # Do stuff
As codice_41 is the only kind of for loop in Python, the equivalent to the &quot;counter&quot; loop found in other languages is...
for i in range(len(seq)):
 # Do something to seq[i]
... although using the codice_42 function is considered more &quot;Pythonic&quot;:
for i, item in enumerate(seq):
 # Do stuff with item
 # Possibly assign it back to seq[i]
=== R ===
for (item in object) {
 # Do something with item


As codice_41 is the only kind of codice_1 loop in R, the equivalent to the &quot;counter&quot; loop found in other languages is...
for (i in seq_along(object)) {
 # Do something with object[[i]]


=== Racket ===
(for ([item set])
 (do-something-with item))
or using the conventional Scheme codice_45 function:
(for-each do-something-with a-list)

codice_46 is a one-argument function.

=== Raku ===
In [[Raku (programming language)|Raku]], a sister language to Perl, &quot;for&quot; must be used to traverse elements of a list (&quot;foreach&quot; is not allowed). The expression which denotes the collection to loop over is evaluated in list-context, but not flattened by default, and each item of the resulting list is, in turn, aliased to the loop variable(s).

List literal example:
for 1..4 {
 .say;


Array examples:
for @arr {
 .say;


The for loop in its statement modifier form:
.say for @arr;

for @arr -&gt; $x {
 say $x;

for @arr -&gt; $x, $y { # more than one item at a time
 say &quot;$x, $y&quot;;


Hash example:
for keys %hash -&gt; $key {
 say &quot;$key: $hash{$key}&quot;;


or
for %hash.kv -&gt; $key, $value {
 say &quot;$key: $value&quot;;


or
for %hash -&gt; $x {
 say &quot;$x.key(): $x.value()&quot;; # Parentheses needed to inline in double quoted string

Direct modification of collection members with a doubly pointy block, &quot;&lt;-&gt;&quot;: 
my @arr = 1,2,3;
for @arr &lt;-&gt; $x {
 $x *= 2;
# Now @arr = 2,4,6;
=== Ruby ===
set.each do |item|
 # do something to item
end
or
for item in set
 # do something to item
end
This can also be used with a hash.
set.each do |key,value|
 # do something to key
 # do something to value
end
=== Rust ===

The codice_1 loop has the structure for &lt;pattern&gt; in &lt;expression&gt; { /* optional statements */ }. It implicitly calls the codice_48 method on the expression, and uses the resulting value, which must implement the codice_49 trait. If the expression is itself an iterator, it is used directly by the codice_1 loop through an implementation of codice_51 for all codice_49s that returns the iterator unchanged. The loop calls the codice_53 method on the iterator before executing the loop body. If codice_53 returns codice_55, the value inside is assigned to the [[pattern matching|pattern]] and the loop body is executed; if it returns codice_56, the loop is terminated.
let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];

// Immutable reference:
for number in &amp;numbers { // calls IntoIterator::into_iter(&amp;numbers)
 println!(&quot;{}&quot;, number);

for square in numbers.iter().map(|x| x * x) { // numbers.iter().map(|x| x * x) implements Iterator
 println!(&quot;{}&quot;, square);

// Mutable reference:
for number in &amp;mut numbers { // calls IntoIterator::into_iter(&amp;mut numbers)
 *number *= 2;

// prints &quot;[2, 4, 6]&quot;:
println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, numbers);

// Consumes the Vec and creates an Iterator:
for number in numbers { // calls IntoIterator::into_iter(numbers)
}

// Errors with &quot;borrow of moved value&quot;:
// println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, numbers);
=== Scala ===
// return list of modified elements
items map { x =&gt; doSomething(x) }
items map multiplyByTwo

for {x &lt;- items} yield doSomething(x)
for {x &lt;- items} yield multiplyByTwo(x)

// return nothing, just perform action
items foreach { x =&gt; doSomething(x) }
items foreach println

for {x &lt;- items} doSomething(x)
for {x &lt;- items} println(x)

// pattern matching example in for-comprehension
for ((key, value) &lt;- someMap) println(s&quot;$key -&gt; $value&quot;)
=== Scheme ===
(for-each do-something-with a-list)

codice_46 is a one-argument function.

=== Smalltalk ===
collection do: [:item| &quot;do something to item&quot; ]
=== Swift ===
[[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] uses the codice_1…codice_59 construct to iterate over members of a collection.
for thing in someCollection {
 // do something with thing


The codice_1…codice_59 loop is often used with the closed and half-open range constructs to iterate over the loop body a certain number of times.
for i in 0..&lt;10 {
 // 0..&lt;10 constructs a half-open range, so the loop body
 // is repeated for i = 0, i = 1, …, i = 9.

for i in 0...10 {
 // 0...10 constructs a closed range, so the loop body
 // is repeated for i = 0, i = 1, …, i = 9, i = 10.


=== SystemVerilog ===
[[SystemVerilog]] supports iteration over any vector or array type of any dimensionality using the codice_2 keyword.

A trivial example iterates over an array of integers:

A more complex example iterates over an associative array of arrays of integers:

=== Tcl ===
[[Tcl]] uses foreach to iterate over lists. It is possible to specify more than one iterator variable, in which case they are assigned sequential values from the list. 
It is also possible to iterate over more than one list simultaneously. In the following codice_63 assumes sequential values of the first list, codice_64 sequential values of the second list:
=== Visual Basic (.NET) ===
For Each item In enumerable
 &#x27; Do something with item.
Next
or without [[type inference]]
For Each item As type In enumerable
 &#x27; Do something with item.
Next
=== Windows ===
==== Conventional command processor ====

Invoke a hypothetical codice_65 command three times, giving it a color name each time.

C:\&gt;FOR %%a IN ( red green blue ) DO frob %%a
==== Windows PowerShell ====
foreach ($item in $set) {
 # Do something to $item


From a pipeline
$list | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_}

# or using the aliases
$list | foreach {write $_}
$list | % {write $_}
=== XSLT ===
 &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;set&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!-- do something for the elements in &lt;set&gt; --&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;

Yellandu is located at . It has an average elevation of 205 metres (672 feet). Bhuga vagu divides Yellandu which is started from Yellandula padu cheruvu. one of the important coal seams bore his name. The Hyderabad (Deccan) Company Limited incorporated in England acquired mining rights in 1886 to exploit coal found in Yellandu area. The present Company was incorporated on 23 December 1920 under the Hyderabad Companies Act as a public limited company with the name &#x27;The Singareni Collieries Company Limited&#x27; (SCCL). It acquired all the assets and liabilities of the Hyderabad (Deccan) Co. Ltd. Best &amp; Co., acted as Secretaries and Selling Agents. The State of Hyderabad purchased majority shares of the Company in 1945. From 1945 to 1949, the Hyderabad Construction Co., Ltd., was acting as Managing Agent. In 1949 this function was entrusted to Industrial Trust Fund by the then Government of Hyderabad. The controlling interest of the Company devolved on the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956 pursuant to the reorganization of States.

<doc id="623074" wikidata="Q4369591" url="?curid=623074" title="Battleground (short story)">
<text>&quot;Battleground&quot; is a fantasy short story by American writer Stephen King, first published in the September 1972 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine, and later collected in King&#x27;s 1978 collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
Renshaw is a professional hit-man, who returns from his assassination of a toy-maker to find a package delivered to his penthouse apartment in the Bay Area. The package contains a &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; Vietnam footlocker, sent to him by the mother of the toy-maker he had recently killed. When he opens the package, he finds that the toy soldiers are alive with working copies (albeit miniature) of weapons, jeeps, and helicopters. To Renshaw&#x27;s surprise, the tiny soldiers begin to attack him. Despite his training and experience as a hitman, Renshaw finds himself outnumbered and outgunned, and he cedes control of the living room to the toy soldiers, taking cover in the bathroom. As the soldiers establish a base camp on his dining table, they unveil more and more military hardware, ranging from shoulder-launched rockets to military attack helicopters. The soldiers pass a piece of paper under the door, demanding his surrender, but Renshaw writes &quot;NUTS&quot; on the paper and sends it back, prompting a barrage of rocket fire which destroys most of the door.

Renshaw eventually plots to destroy the soldiers with a Molotov cocktail constructed from a bottle of lighter fluid, but before the cocktail detonates, a massive blast destroys the entire apartment. Outside in a park below, a couple finds Renshaw&#x27;s bloody shirt, and the other contents of the footlocker are revealed, including one made-to-scale thermonuclear weapon.

== Film and TV adaptations ==

&quot;Battleground&quot; was converted to a teleplay by Richard Christian Matheson for the television series &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes.&quot; Originally airing on Wednesday July 12, 2006, the episode was directed by Brian Henson and starred William Hurt as Renshaw the assassin. There is no dialogue in the entire episode.

The episode featured a longer ending than the short story, in which Renshaw is attacked again and makes it out of the penthouse for a final showdown in the elevator shaft with an angry plastic commando (played by an uncredited Bill Barretta). Renshaw defeats the final commando, only to find it has armed a thermonuclear weapon that then explodes and kills him.

The story was also made into an animated short film, &quot;Srazhenie&quot; ( - meaning &quot;Battle&quot;; see External Links below) by the Soviet Kievnauchfilm studio in 1986, directed by Mikhail Titov.

A similar concept was used in the 1981 anthology series &quot;Darkroom.&quot; The segment, titled &quot;The Siege of 31 August,&quot; involved a Vietnam Vet turned farmer that discovers the army men he purchased for his son have come to life.

<doc id="623077" wikidata="Q131418" url="?curid=623077" title="Timor Sea">
<text>The Timor Sea (, , or ) is a relatively shallow sea in the Indian Ocean bounded to the north by the island of Timor with Timor-Leste to the north, Indonesia to the northwest, Arafura Sea to the east, and to the south by Australia. The Sunda Trench marks the deepest point of the Timor Sea with a depth of more than 3300 metres, separating the continents of Oceania in the southeast and Asia to the northwest and north. The Timor sea is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis north of the Sunda Trench, due to its location on the Ring of Fire as well as volcanic activity and can experience major cyclones, due to the proximity from the Equator.

The sea contains a number of reefs, uninhabited islands and significant hydrocarbon reserves. International disputes emerged after the reserves were discovered resulting in the signing of the Timor Sea Treaty.

The Timor Sea was hit by the worst oil spill for 25 years in 2009.

It is possible that Australia&#x27;s first inhabitants crossed the Timor Sea from the Malay Archipelago at a time when sea levels were lower.

== Etymology ==
The Timor Sea is named after Timor, the island on the other side of the sea&#x27;s northern coastline. The island&#x27;s name is a variant of , Malay for &quot;east&quot;.

In Tetum, the sea is often referred to by the expression (). The counterpart of that body of water, the &#x27;Ombai-Wetar Strait&#x27;, which has smaller waves, is less turbid, and washes most of Timor island&#x27;s northern shores, is commonly referred to in Tetum as ().

== Geography ==

The waters to the east are known as the Arafura Sea. The Timor Sea is adjacent to three substantial inlets on the north Australian coast, the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Beagle Gulf and the Van Diemen Gulf. The Australian city of Darwin which is located in part on the shore of the Beagle Gulf, is the nearest large city to the sea. The small town of Wyndham is located on the west arm of Cambridge Gulf, an inlet of Joseph Bonaparte Gulf.

Rivers that enter the Timor Sea from the Northern Territory include Fish River, King River, Dry River, Victoria River and the Alligator Rivers. Rivers in the Kimberley region that flow into the Timor Sea include the Ord River, Forrest River, Pentecost River and Durack River.

The sea is about wide, covering an area of about . Its deepest point is the Timor Trough (which some geologists consider is the south-eastern extension of the Java Trench, but others view as a foreland trough to the Timor Island &quot;mountain range&quot;), located in the northern part of the sea, which reaches a depth of . The remainder of the sea is much shallower, much of it averaging less than deep, as it overlies the Sahul Shelf, part of the Australian continental shelf.

The Big Bank Shoals is an area on the sloping seabed between the continental shelf and the Timor Trough where a number of submerged banks are located. The ecosystem of the shoals differs significantly from the deeper waters surrounding them. In May 2010, it was announced that a crater about wide has been discovered on the seabed of the Timor Sea.

=== Extent ===

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Timor Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:

&quot;On the North&quot; The Southeastern limit of the Savu Sea [By a line from the Southwest point of Timor to the Northeast point of Roti, through this island to its Southwest point] the Southeastern coast of Timor and the Southern limit of the Banda Sea [A line from Tanjong Aro Oesoe, through Sermata to Tanjong Njadora the Southeast point of Lakov () along the South coasts of Lakov, Moa and Leti Islands to Tanjong Toet Pateh, the West point of Leti, thence a line to Tanjong Sewirawa the Eastern extremity of Timor].

&quot;On the East.&quot; The Western [limit] of the Arafura Sea [A line from Cape Don to Tanjong Aro Oesoe, the Southern point of Selaroe (Tanimbar Islands)].

&quot;On the South.&quot; The North coast of Australia from Cape Don to Cape Londonderry ().

&quot;On the West.&quot; A line from Cape Londonderry to the Southwest point of Roti Island


=== Meteorology ===
Many tropical storms and cyclones originate or pass through the Timor Sea. In February 2005, Tropical Cyclone Vivienne disrupted oil and gas production facilities in the area, and the next month, Severe Tropical Cyclone Willy interrupted production. Petroleum production facilities are designed to withstand the effects of cyclones, although as a safety precaution production work is often reduced or temporarily halted and workers evacuated by helicopter to the mainland - usually to Darwin or Dili.

=== Reefs and islands ===

A number of significant islands are located in the sea, notably Melville Island, part of the Tiwi Islands, off Australia and the Australian-governed Ashmore and Cartier Islands. It is thought that early humans reached Australia by &quot;island-hopping&quot; across the Timor Sea.

Scott and Seringapatam Reefs formed in the area and to the west, on the same underwater platform, are the Rowley Shoals.

== History ==
=== World War II ===

During the 1940s the Japanese navy conducted air raids on Australia from ships in the Timor Sea. On the 19 February 1942 the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga with other vessels, launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, sinking nine ships, including the &quot;USS Peary&quot;. This bombing marked the beginning of the Battle of Timor in the Pacific theatre of World War II.

== Hydrology ==
=== Timor Current ===
The Timor Current is an oceanic current that runs south-west in the Timor Sea between the Malay Archipelago and Australia. It is a major contributor to the Indonesian Throughflow that transports water from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean.

== Hydrocarbon reserves ==

Beneath the Timor Sea lie considerable reserves of oil and gas. Confirmation of the prospectivity of the Timor Sea came when Woodside-Burmah&#x27;s Big John rig drilled Troubadour No. 1 well in June 1974 on the Troubadour Shoals about southeast of Timor, and intersected of hydrocarbons. A number of offshore petroleum projects are in operation and there is considerable exploration activity either underway and numerous proposed projects. A gas pipeline crosses the Timor Sea from the Joint Petroleum Development Area to Wickham Point near Darwin.

The Timor Sea was the location for Australia&#x27;s largest oil spill when the Montara oil field leaked oil, natural gas and condensate from 21 August to 3 November 2009. During the spill of oil leaked each day. The Montara Commission of Inquiry placed blame on the Thai company PTTEP, owner of the wells. In response to the disaster, Indonesian seaweed farmers engaged in a class action lawsuit to claim for damages.

=== Bayu-Undan project ===
The largest petroleum project in operation in the Timor Sea is the Bayu-Undan project operated by Santos. The Bayu-Undan field is located approximately north-west of Darwin in the Bonaparte Basin. Production commenced in 2004 as a gas recycle project - with liquids (condensate, propane and butane) being stripped from the raw production stream and exported. Gas was pumped back down into the reservoir. At around the same time, construction commenced on a subsea natural gas pipeline connecting the Bayu-Undan processing facility to a liquefied natural gas plant situated at Wickham Point in Darwin harbour. Since the completion of the pipeline and the Darwin LNG plant in 2005, gas produced offshore at Bayu-Undan is now transported to the Darwin plant where it is converted into a liquid and transported to Japan under long-term sales contracts. Timor-Leste has made, as of 2017, over $18 billion from Bayu-Undan since production began; however, it is predicted its reserves will be exhausted by 2023.

===Ichthys gas field===
The Ichthys gas field is a natural gas field located in the Timor Sea, off the northwestern coast of Australia. The field is located 220 km offshore Western Australia and 820 km southwest of Darwin, with an average water depth of approximately 250 metres. It was discovered in 2000. First Gas from the Ichthys field was achieved on 30 July 2018.

=== Other projects ===
AED Oil owns the large oil project at Puffin oilfield and Woodside Petroleum is producing oil at the Laminaria oilfield. The Greater Sunrise gas field, discovered in 1974, is one of the largest in the area and is expected to earn East Timor several billion dollars in royalty revenues. Woodside Petroleum plans to process gas from Greater Sunrise via a floating platform, however Xanana Gusmão, East Timor&#x27;s Prime Minister opposes this plan and instead wants the gas to go to Beaço via a pipeline for processing.

Since 2018, Santos has sought to establish the Barossa offshore gas project to exploit a gas field in order to supply the Darwin liquefield natural gas (LNG) onshore terminal when gas from Bayu-Undan runs out in the 2020s. This has been opposed by Dangalaba and Larrakia people as well as climate justice organisations.

== Territorial dispute ==

Since the discovery of petroleum in the Timor Sea in the 1970s, there have been disputes surrounding the rights to ownership and exploitation of the resources situated in a part of the Timor Sea known as the Timor Gap, which is the area of the Timor Sea which lies outside the territorial boundaries of the nations to the north and south of the Timor Sea. These disagreements initially involved Australia and Indonesia, although a resolution was eventually reached in the form of the Timor Gap Treaty. After declaration of East Timor&#x27;s nationhood in 1999, the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty were abandoned and negotiations commenced between Australia and East Timor, culminating in the Timor Sea Treaty.

From 1965 to 2018, Australia&#x27;s territorial claim extended to the bathymetric axis (the line of greatest sea-bed depth) at the Timor Trough. It overlapped East Timor&#x27;s own territorial claim, which followed the former colonial power Portugal and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in claiming that the dividing line should be midway between the two countries. In 2018, Australia agreed to a median line boundary.

It was revealed in 2013 that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) planted listening devices to listen to East Timor during negotiations over the Greater Sunrise oil and gasfields. This is known as the Australia–East Timor spying scandal.

=== Timor Sea Treaty ===
The Timor Sea Treaty, which was signed on the 20 May 2002, led to the establishment of the Timor Sea Designated Authority (TSDA). This organisation is responsible for the administration of all petroleum-related activities in a part of the Timor Sea known as the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA). The treaty was ratified in February 2007.

Under the terms of the treaty, royalties on petroleum production in the JPDA are split in a 90:10 ratio between East Timor and Australia. It has been criticised because the treaty did not finalise the maritime boundary between East Timor and Australia.

=== 2018 Maritime Boundaries Treaty ===
The &quot;Australia–Timor Leste Treaty Establishing Their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea&quot; was signed on 6 March 2018 at United Nations headquarters in New York in the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

<text>&quot;Survivor Type&quot; is a psychological horror short story by Stephen King, first published in the 1982 horror anthology &quot;Terrors&quot;, edited by Charles L. Grant, and included in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;. The Robinsonade follows a shipwrecked drug-trafficking surgeon who, left with only a large amount of drugs and no food or resources, resorts to self-cannibalism.

King considered the idea that came to him to be too disgusting, saying that &quot;[it] goes a little bit too far, even for me.&quot; He consulted with a doctor, discussing how long a person could feed on his own body. Even being a famous writer, the author could not get the story published for a long time. Literary critics emphasized the author’s courage, humor and irony inherent in the work, as well as the realism of the events described, though some assessments of the plot were more restrained. The story has been adapted into short film and television format multiple times.

==Plot summary==
The story opens with the following epigraph:
&quot;Survivor Type&quot; is an epistolary story written as the diary of a disgraced surgeon, Richard Pine, who, while attempting to smuggle a large amount of heroin aboard a cruise ship, is forced to escape when an explosion causes the ship to sink. Pine relates growing up poor in New York City&#x27;s Little Italy, attending medical school, and establishing successful practice until his illegal distribution of prescription medicines led to the loss of his license. He arranged to smuggle heroin from Vietnam to make a large amount of money, which would then be distributed for bribes that would enable him to return to practicing medicine. 

Pine finds himself marooned on a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean whose exact location is completely unknown to him, with very limited supplies and no food. A self-proclaimed &quot;survivor&quot; type, he bitterly whiles away the time by using a logbook as his diary, detailing his rise and fall in the medical profession and his determination to survive this ordeal, get even with the people that &quot;screwed him over&quot;, and return to prosperity.

Over time, the diary entries become more and more disjointed and raving, revealing Pine&#x27;s slow mental decay and eventual insanity caused by starvation, isolation, and drug use. Determined to hold out for rescue, he goes to horrifying lengths to survive. He eats insects, kelp, and seagulls. After fracturing his ankle while attempting to signal an airplane, he amputates his own foot, then realizes he has to eat it to survive. He continues to amputate his own limbs to use as a food source, ingesting the heroin as a crude anesthetic during these operations. Although he initially keeps track of the dates (the entries begin January 26), his increasing mental instability causes him to lose perception of days passed (finally ending his entries with &quot;&quot;Febba&quot; and &quot;Fe/40?&quot;&quot;). His last few diary entries, barely comprehensible, indicate that Pine has sliced off and eaten both legs, as well as his earlobes, and drools uncontrollably as he ponders which body part to consume next. The diary entries end when he cuts off his left hand to eat it and writes that his fingers taste just like lady fingers.

==Development==
In the &quot;Notes&quot; section of the 1985 short fiction collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, Stephen King wrote about the topic of arriving at the story&#x27;s premise: &quot;I got to thinking about cannibalism one day . . . and my muse once more evacuated its magic bowels on my head. I know how gross that sounds, but it&#x27;s the best metaphor I know.&quot; King later elaborates that he was so interested in the idea that it was all he could think about for days. Hesitant to write anything down, King gained the assurance for the story after speaking with his neighbor, Ralph Drews, a retired doctor who confirmed that &quot;a guy could subsist on himself for quite a while - like everything else which is material, the human body is just stored energy.&quot; Dr. Drews&#x27;s further elaborations became the inspiration for the opening epigraph of the story.

King wrote &quot;Survivor Type&quot; in 1977, but he was unable to sell it for years; he stated that &quot;not even men&#x27;s magazines would consider this one&quot;. In a 2021 interview with Stephen Colbert, King stated that &quot;Survivor Type&quot; was his favorite story that he had written.

<doc id="623083" wikidata="Q7197031" url="?curid=623083" title="Piotr Zak">
<text>Piotr (or Pjotr) Zak is the name of a fictional Polish composer whose alleged composition &quot;Mobile for Tape and Percussion&quot; was broadcast twice on the BBC Third Programme on 5 June 1961 in a performance supposedly played by &quot;Claude Tessier&quot; and &quot;Anton Schmidt&quot;. In fact, the composer and the performers were pseudonyms of BBC producers Hans Keller and Susan Bradshaw, who concocted the deliberately unmusical percussive piece as a hoax. According to Bradshaw, &quot;It was a serious hoax to set people thinking that fake music can be indistinguishable from the genuine.&quot; The success of the hoax, however, is open to question. While &quot;Mobile for Tape and Percussion&quot; was reviewed seriously by several critics, all of the reviews were roundly negative, with the piece being almost instantly identified as a &quot;non-musical&quot; studio prank.

==History==

===Broadcast and critical reaction===

The broadcast of the work was preceded by alleged biographical information about Zak in the form of a programme note supposedly written by Schmidt. The text read by the announcer (Alvar Lidell) was as follows:

:Piotr Zak, who is of Polish extraction but lives in Germany, was born in 1939. His earliest works are conservative, but he has recently come under the influence of Stockhausen and John Cage. This work for tape and percussion was written between May and September of last year. Within the precise and complex framework defined by the score, there is considerable room for improvisation.

The work was reviewed by three critics, who gave unenthusiastic or outright condemnatory reactions.

Jeremy Noble&#x27;s review in the &quot;Times&quot; stated &quot;It was certainly difficult to grasp more than the music&#x27;s broad outlines, partly because of the high proportion of unpitched sounds and partly because of their extreme diversity&quot;. Noble deemed the broadcast a &quot;lapse&quot; on the part of the BBC, and wrote &quot;such recognizably musical events as did occur seemed trivial&quot;.

Further down the scale from Noble&#x27;s overall pan (leavened with some extremely faint praise), the &quot;Daily Telegraph&#x27;s&quot;′ critic Donald Mitchell called the performance &quot;wholly unrewarding&quot;, adding that Zak 

Rollo Myers, writing in the &quot;Listener&quot;, was harsher still, accurately identifying the piece as a &quot;farce d&#x27;atelier&quot; (studio prank) with &quot;no possible claim to be considered as music&quot;, and characterising the BBC&#x27;s broadcast of such a thing &quot;a serious error of judgment&quot;. Myers continued, He concluded with praise for the other works on the programme, by Webern, Nono, Petrassi, and &quot;the always satisfying Serenade in B flat for thirteen wind instruments by Mozart—which may have been missed by the many listeners who, I am sure, switched off their sets for the repeat performance of the Zak&quot;.

===Admission of hoax===
Nearly two months after the event, a BBC spokesman denied that the work was a hoax, describing it instead as an &quot;experiment&quot;, in which &quot;the percussion instruments on the tape were played at random. I imagine that Piotr Zak does not exist. But we did not hoax the listeners. It was an experiment&quot;. A conflicting report published the next day claimed that the BBC confessed the entire programme had been a hoax. It was revealed that the piece had been produced by Hans Keller and Susan Bradshaw at the BBC. By striking randomly and with deliberate senselessness at a collection of percussion instruments, the two (as &quot;Tessier&quot; and &quot;Schmidt&quot;) had produced a strenuously meaningless twelve-minute &quot;work&quot; of superficially &quot;avant-garde&quot; character; this was completed by the addition of a selection of human whistling sounds (evidently meant to represent the &quot;tape&quot;), and with the resulting chaos being edited into some kind of whole by BBC technicians.

Revealing the true nature of the work was itself apparently part of the publicity for the BBC broadcast of a radio documentary, &quot;The Strange Case of Piotr Zak&quot;, first aired on 13 August 1961, in which Keller discussed his hoax with music critics Jeremy Noble and Donald Mitchell. Both critics agreed that the manner of presentation required them to take the piece seriously, but, since they both had given it an unfavourable review, they could not be said to have been fully taken in by the hoax.

In the months and years after the original broadcast, some tellings of the story indicated that Zak&#x27;s work received favourable reviews from critics unable to distinguish random noise from genuine avant-garde music. However, in an October 1961 editorial in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, editor Andrew Porter noted of &#x27;The Zak Affair&#x27; that while some reports indicated that &quot;critics were taken in by it...Let it go on record that this was not the case.&quot; After discussing and quoting several contemporaneous reviews (and referencing the similar Ern Malley affair that caused controversy in modern poetry circles 16 years earlier), Porter wrote that &quot;the critics showed clearly that they could distinguish between Zak and Stockhausen – whose &quot;Zyklus&quot;, &#x27;bashed out&#x27; by an imported solo percussionist at an earlier BBC concert, &quot;was&quot; praised.&quot;

===Zak as reviewer===
Despite Porter&#x27;s editorial, &quot;Pjotr Zak&quot; (whose first name had always been previously identified as &quot;Piotr&quot;) wrote a piece for &quot;The Musical Times&quot; a few months later. Written in actuality by Keller, it appeared in the July 1962 issue. Zak&#x27;s piece was a 700-word review of Stockhausen&#x27;s score for &quot;Zyklus&quot;, a work that had debuted in performance in 1959, but was not published as a score until 1962.

Zak&#x27;s review discussed the nature of the score, which allows for improvisation, while indicating that he could not answer the question of how the meaning of Stockhausen&#x27;s score was &quot;audibly different from (a) a completely free improvisation from the same performer, or indeed (b) an experiment of the kind my &quot;Mobile&quot; has immortalized.&quot; However, Zak went on to write that &quot;nobody interested in the development of creative thought can allow himself to remain ignorant of Stockhausen&#x27;s score.&quot; He also humorously suggested that while Stockhausen was unquestionably an influence on &quot;Zak&quot;, Zak&#x27;s &quot;Mobile&quot; may have been an influence on the published score for &quot;Zyklus&quot;...&quot;even though neither Stockhausen nor I may readily admit the fact&quot;.

<text>Coleoidea or Dibranchiata is one of the two subclasses of cephalopods containing all the various taxa popularly thought of as &quot;soft-bodied&quot; or &quot;shell-less&quot; (i.e. octopus, squid and cuttlefish). Unlike its extant sister group Nautiloidea, whose members have a rigid outer shell for protection, the coleoids have at most an internal shell called cuttlebone or gladius that is used for buoyancy or as muscle anchorage. Some species, notably incirrate octopuses, have lost their internal shell altogether, while in some it has been replaced by a chitinous support structure.

The major divisions of Coleoidea are based upon the number of arms or tentacles and their structure. The extinct and most primitive form, the Belemnoidea, presumably had ten equally-sized arms in five pairs numbered dorsal to ventral as I, II, III, IV and V. More modern species either modified or lost a pair of arms. The superorder Decapodiformes has arm pair IV modified into long tentacles with suckers generally only on the club-shaped distal end. Superorder Octopodiformes has modifications to arm pair II; it is significantly reduced and used only as a sensory filament in the Vampyromorphida, while Octopoda species have totally lost that arm pair. The inner surface of the suckers (acetabulum) are reinforced with rigid sucker rings which are smooth in Sepiolida, have blunt teeth in Sepiida and sharply pointed teeth in Loliginidae and Oegopsida. The arms and/or tentacles of some oegopsid families have also evolved claw-like hooks.

==Evolutionary history==
The earliest certain coleoids are known from the Mississippian sub-period of the Carboniferous Period, about 330 million years ago. Some older fossils have been described from the Devonian,
but paleontologists disagree about whether they are coleoids. Other cephalopods with internal shells, which could represent coleoids but may also denote the independent internalization of the shell, are known from the Silurian. It has been hypothesized that the Early–Middle Cambrian fossil &quot;Nectocaris&quot; represents a coleoid (or other cephalopod) that lost its shell, possibly secondarily, although it is more likely that &quot;Nectocaris&quot; represents an independent lineage within the Lophotrochozoa.

By the Carboniferous, coleoids already had a diversity of forms, but the major radiation happened during the Tertiary. Although most of these groups are traditionally classified as belemnoids, the variation among them suggests that some are not closely related to belemnites.

<text>Graham Miles (11 May 1941 – 12 October 2014) was an English snooker player.

==Career==
Miles turned professional in 1971. He first gained recognition in 1974, when he reached the final of the World Championship, losing 12–22 to Ray Reardon. As he was left-eye dominant, the right-handed Miles developed an idiosyncratic sighting style with his cue crossing his chin on the left side. This style became more pronounced over time, to the point where the cue ran beneath his left ear.

Miles became one of the best known players in Britain, in an era when there was little televised snooker other than the &quot;Pot Black&quot; series. He won this tournament at his first attempt in 1974 (after entering as a late replacement for Fred Davis, who withdrew because of illness) and again in 1975. Other notable moments in his career included reaching the final of the 1976 Masters, where he again lost to Reardon.

The 1978/79 season saw something of a purple patch for Miles. At the 1978 UK Championship he defeated Rex Williams 9–8 and then easily beat Willie Thorne 9–1, which included what was then a championship record break of 139 in the last frame. However, he was then dispatched 1–9 by eventual winner Doug Mountjoy.

This form continued in January 1979, when he reached the final of the Holsten Lager International by defeating John Pulman, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins. He led John Spencer 7–6 in the final, having made a break of 107, but eventually lost 7–11 to take £2,000 as runner-up.

Miles led defending champion Ray Reardon 3–0 and 5–3 in the first round of the 1979 World Championship, but he came down with flu and lost 8–13. Straight after this, Miles defeated Doug Mountjoy 4–3 and Perrie Mans 5–2 in the group stages of the Pontins Professional Event. Miles then beat Steve Davis 4–0 in the semi-final but lost 4–8 in the final to Doug Mountjoy.

At the inaugural World Team Cup, Miles represented England along with John Spencer and Fred Davis, where they reached the final only to be beaten 3–14 by Wales. His last major victory was the 1981 Tolly Cobbold Classic, when he beat Cliff Thorburn 5–1 in Ipswich. During the 1980s he slid down the rankings, and 1984 saw his last appearance at the World Championship.

==Personal life==
After retiring from the game in 1992, he ran two snooker clubs at Sandwell, West Midlands, and one in Crewe, Cheshire. He came out of retirement to play at the Seniors Pot Black competition in 1997.

Miles died on 12 October 2014, aged 73.

<doc id="623097" wikidata="Q952375" url="?curid=623097" title="Shifu">
<text>Shifu is a Chinese cultural term. Although its pronunciation always sounds the same, there are two ways of writing it using Chinese characters, and they bear two different meanings. The first variation, Shīfù 師傅 (&#x27;Expert Instructor&#x27;), is used as an honorific, which is applied to various professionals in everyday life.

The second variation, Shīfu 師父 (&#x27;Father-Teacher&#x27;), is an honorific usually reserved as a title to describe teachers of Chinese Martial Arts, and those who might teach other encompassing Chinese traditions, such as painting, sculpting, Feng Shui, singing, etc. While in China both variations are commonly used, in English-speaking countries people are mostly familiar with the second way of writing, in the context of the martial art traditions. 

In the second inflection, &quot;Shifu&quot; has a deeper meaning than just a teacher, but a teacher who gives the utmost care for his or her pupils, as would a father or mother. The martial arts honorific is also commonly Romanized as Sifu (from Cantonese Chinese) or Saihu (from Hokkien Chinese).

==Etymology==
&quot;Shifu&quot; is in fact the English spelling of two similar but distinct Chinese words ( and ). The only phonetic difference between the two words is the tone of the second syllable. Because English is not a tonal language, in English texts the two words are usually written the same way. Even among native speakers of Chinese, the words are pronounced so similarly and have such similar meanings, the precise difference between the two is sometimes unclear.

The first word () is made up of syllables meaning &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;mentor&quot;, and is used by an apprentice speaking to their mentor. &quot;Shifu&quot; () historically referred to master craftsmen. However, by the late twentieth century, artisans no longer occupied the same place of reverence they once did. &quot;Shifu&quot; is therefore less widely used in the shift towards an industrial and service economy. Alternatively, it is used as a respectful form of address for skilled tradespeople, such as pharmacists, and workers in various trades like construction, plumbing, carpentry, welding, and electrical work, as well as technicians in fields like telecommunications and mechanics. In Mainland China during the Cultural Revolution, &quot;shifu&quot; was sometimes adopted as a substitute for &quot;comrade&quot; (同志, tóngzhì) to refer to any stranger.

The second term () replaces the syllable meaning &quot;mentor&quot; with one meaning &quot;father&quot;. It can also be used to address a teacher, but the substitution lends it a more intimate tone and indicates a heightened level of respect. It has an association with religion, because Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars and Taoist priests often establish master/apprentice-like relationships with initiates and are addressed with this term.

Although a martial arts &quot;shifu&quot; may establish a Master-Apprentice type of relationship with certain students, the Chinese characters used for the term do not imply &#x27;Mastery&#x27;. Rather, the characters mean either &#x27;expertise with teaching ability&#x27; (shīfù 師傅) in the case of a professional, or &#x27;teaching as a father would&#x27; (shīfù 師父) in the case of a martial arts instructor.

==Use in martial arts==

Traditionally in Chinese Martial Arts, and still today, s&quot;hifu&quot; has been used as a familial term and sign of respect for teachers. Shifu is not a rank (like a &#x27;black belt&#x27;), but rather, a title, similar to that of &#x27;Sensei&#x27; in Japanese Martial Arts&#x27;. 

A &quot;shifu&quot; was deemed a &quot;father&quot;, therefore his disciples would address each other as &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot;, particularly &quot;big brothers&quot; (), &quot;little brothers&quot; (), &quot;big sisters&quot; () and &quot;little sisters&quot; (). More specific familial prefixes could also be used, for example as in &quot;biggest brother&quot; (), &quot;second biggest (big) sister&quot; (), &quot;third biggest (little) sister&quot; (). Unlike actual familial prefixes however, &quot;dà&quot;-, &quot;èr&quot;-, &quot;sān&quot;-, etc. usually depended on the order in which a disciple was officially adopted by the master (i.e. seniority), not on their age. Likewise, whether or not fellow disciples are addressed as &quot;big&quot; or &quot;little&quot; brother/sister depended on whether they were adopted by the master before or after the subject, not on whether or not they are actually older or younger in age.

Despite the &quot;father&quot; meaning of the word , the term is also used to address a female teacher, while the term &quot;shīmǔ&quot; () or &quot;master-mother&quot; is used to address a male teacher&#x27;s wife. A female teacher&#x27;s husband is addressed as () or &quot;master-husband&quot;. Additionally, there are also terms for the master&#x27;s fellow disciples, such as &quot;big uncle&quot; () or &quot;little uncle&quot; (), which also apply regardless of sex. Whether or not they are addressed as &quot;big uncle&quot; or &quot;little uncle&quot; also depends on when that person was adopted by the master&#x27;s master, not their age. 

The term takes on a less intimate context when a student becomes a formal student or disciple of the teacher. The acceptance as a student is a very formal event, usually requiring a discipleship ceremony called (). After the ceremony, the relationship is defined in a more direct parent–child context and usage takes on this term rather than a generic sign of respect for skill and knowledge. The disciple may then, by his or her closer relationship with the &quot;shifu&quot;, gain more intimate and sometimes secretive knowledge, about the style being taught.

<text>The Gare Loch or Gareloch () is an open sea loch in Argyll and Bute in the west of Scotland, and it bears a similar name to the village of Gairloch in the north west Highlands.

The loch is well used for recreational boating, water sports and fishing. Harbour and grey seals are often seen in the Gare Loch along with pods of porpoise. Bottle Nose whales were photographed in September 2020. The loch also has been used since the early 20th century for naval training and as a base for the United Kingdom&#x27;s submarine based nuclear weapons system.

==Geography==

A sea loch aligned north–south, Gare Loch is long with an average width of . At its southern end it opens into the Firth of Clyde through the Rhu narrows. The village of Rosneath lies on the western shore just north of Rosneath Point and gives the name Rosneath Peninsula to the whole body of land separating the Gare Loch from Loch Long to the west.

The town of Helensburgh lies on the eastern shore and is the largest settlement on the banks of the loch. Other towns and villages next to the loch include Rhu, Garelochhead, Shandon, Argyll, Clynder and Rosneath.

==Recreational and shipping use==

At the north end of the loch the substantial village of Garelochhead includes adventure holiday facilities and has a station on the West Highland Line. The Gare Loch offers good conditions for sightseeing, sailing and sea angling.

The Greek sugar boat was heading for the sheltered waters of the Loch but now lies wrecked in the Clyde.

==Naval history==

The base was used by the Royal Navy dating back to the First World War. On 29 January 1917 the steam-powered submarine sank in the loch during sea-trials. The submarine was carrying 80 passengers, made up of naval personnel as well as shipbuilders, when seawater entered the engine room causing flooding which killed 31. The remaining 48 men aboard were rescued in an effort which took over 57 hours. The submarine was later salvaged and re-entered service as HMS &quot;K22&quot;. As a result of sinking of &quot;K13&quot;, no other Royal Navy vessel has been named using the number 13.

However it was during the Second World War that the loch became the site of a major naval base as its depth made it suitable to accommodate a large variety of naval craft. The loch was widely used by the United States military forces, alongside operations on nearby Holy Loch, during the war for naval landing preparations that would be deployed in North Africa and the Normandy landings. In the 1950s, the Royal Navy used the loch to store decommissioned naval vessels.

HMNB Clyde was established on the banks on the loch in 1964 as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s preparations for hosting the Polaris submarine based nuclear programme. The site was chosen due to its deep water, suitable for submarine operations and ease of access to the North Atlantic. The site continues to operate a number of naval operations, mostly associated with the current nuclear Trident defence system and also to be the base of the Royal Navy&#x27;s s.

Given the siting of the nuclear missile programme on the Loch, pressure groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Trident Ploughshares have maintained a permanent peace camp outside the gates of the naval facility since 1982.

The Royal Marines&#x27; Garelochhead training camp was established in the 1940s and is still in use today after a number of new facilities were installed in 2014.

<text>A switchblade (also known as switch knife, automatic knife, pushbutton knife, ejector knife, flick knife, gravity knife, flick blade, or spring knife) is a pocketknife with a sliding or pivoting blade contained in the handle which is extended automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Virtually all switchblades incorporate a locking blade, a means of preventing the blade from being accidentally closed while in the open position. An unlocking mechanism must be activated in order to close the blade for storage.

During the 1950s, US newspapers as well as the tabloid press promoted the image of a new violent crime wave caused by young male delinquents with a switchblade or flick knife, based mostly on anecdotal evidence. In 1954, Democratic Rep. James J. Delaney of New York authored the first bill submitted to the U.S. Congress banning the manufacture and sale of switchblades, beginning a wave of legal restrictions worldwide and a consequent decline in their popularity.

== Method of operation ==
=== Side-opening ===
The most common type of switchblade is the side-opening or out-the-side (OTS) knife. These resemble traditional manually-operated folding knives, but feature a coil or leaf spring which powers a blade that is released when the activation button is pressed. Side-opening knives may feature a safety mechanism that prevents the accidental actuation of the blade release mechanism. Manipulation of a lever, slide button, bolster, or picklock releases the blade for closure.

=== Out the front (OTF) knives ===
==== Double action OTF knives ====
A double action out the front knife is so-called because the blade emerges from the front of the handle and the thumb stud can be moved forwards or backwards to extend or retract the knife respectively.

The knife blade (dark grey) is locked in position by a spring-loaded restraining pin (yellow and red) fitting into a notch in the blade at position 1. The two spring carriers (green) fit into the spaces on the slide (blue) and this assembly rests to the side of the blade. The right spring carrier is restrained by a tab at position 2 that fits over the end of the blade. Tension on the main spring (red zig-zag) holds the other spring carrier, slide and thumb stud (light grey) to the right.

When the thumb stud is pushed forward the slide and left spring carrier are free to travel. This increases tension on the main spring as the blade and right spring carrier are locked. A ramp on the slide impinges on the lower pin. When the pin evacuates the notch, the blade and right spring carrier are free to move. The right spring carrier moves only a short distance before it comes to rest in the slide. Momentum carries the blade further before flanges (not shown) retard its motion.

Another restraining pin at position 3 fits into a notch and locks the blade in the extended position. A tab on the left spring carrier fits into a hole in the blade at position 4 which restrains the left spring carrier. This allows reverse force on the thumb stud to increase tension in the main spring before the upper restraining pin releases and the blade and carrier can return to the closed position.

The small restraining pin at 3 is the only thing holding the blade open and is prone to failure if abused. The whole slide assembly moves only a short distance, exactly as far as the thumb stud moves. The force that causes the blade to extend or retract is equal to the force applied by the user on the thumb stud to stretch the main spring before it releases. For this reason the tip of the blade is unlikely to even break skin and is entirely incapable of causing significant injury when released though the edge of the blade may still cut as it moves as with any knife. Any object in the path of the extending blade may cause the blade to stop before it can lock in position. This is easily remedied by either pulling the blade out so that it locks or pushing it in till it locks and then redeploying.

Double-action knives have the advantages of being able to automatically retract the blade, as well as allowing the main spring to be in the &quot;at rest&quot; position whenever the knife is fully open or closed. However, because they have more complicated mechanisms, double-action OTFs will tend to be more expensive, have a weaker firing action, and a less-solid lockup than comparable single-action OTFs.

==== Single action OTF knives ====
A single action out the front knife operates under similar principles but will only automatically extend the blade which must then be manually retracted.

One spring post (green, left) is rigidly fixed to the handle (orange), the other spring post (green, right) is fastened to the base of the blade. The main spring (red) is under tension, but the blade cannot eject because the spring mounted button (light grey, its spring not shown) is resting in a notch in the blade. The cocking arm (blue) emerges through the base of the handle; friction with the handle holds it in place.

When the button is depressed (sideways into the handle or, as illustrated, into the page) a slot in it aligns with the blade and allows the blade to move forward. When the blade is fully extended flanges on the blade engage pins on the cocking arm retarding the blade&#x27;s motion. The blade is locked in position when the rear notch of the blade allows the button to return to its rest position. Even if the button is pressed spring tension holds the knife open.

To retract the blade the button is again pressed so that its slot aligns with the blade. The cocking arm is pulled backwards which itself pulls the blade backward. When the blade is fully retracted the spring mounted button rests in the forward notch and again pops up and locks the blade in the cocked position. The cocking arm is then manually pushed forward to again sit flush with the handle.

Because the main spring is constantly acting on the blade and is extended by a far greater amount and is cocked by the whole hand and arm rather than by thumb the force it can exert on the blade is greater than with a double action knife. This will easily allow the tip of the blade to break skin when deployed and possibly penetrate a few millimetres (or hundredths of an inch) past it or to pass through light clothing. While still not a hugely strong design, because it is more firmly attached a good quality single action out the front blade displays less wobble and play than its comparable quality double action counterpart.

==Spring-assist knife vs. switchblade==
While operationally identical (in terms of one-handed opening), the &quot;spring-assist&quot; or &quot;assisted opening&quot; knife is not a switchblade or automatic knife. A switchblade opens its blade from the handle automatically to the fully locked and open position with the single press of a button, lever, or switch that is remotely mounted in the knife handle or bolster. In contrast, a spring-assist design uses either 1) manual pressure upon a protrusion on the blade itself or 2) movement of a lever or switch directly linked to the blade to initiate &quot;partial&quot; opening of the blade, at which point an internal spring propels the blade into the fully open, locked position. By this definition, some out-the-front automatics could be considered spring-assisted knives rather than switchblades, and some merchants in the United States sold them as such during periods of switchblade illegality.

Despite this difference in function, the criminal codes of many nations treat the assisted opening knife as a prohibited weapon like the switchblade. 
In the US, persons have occasionally been arrested or prosecuted by state law enforcement authorities for carrying assisted-opening knives defined as an illegal switchblade. An attempt to criminalize the sale of spring-assisted knives by federal law enforcement was forestalled by a US 2009 amendment (Amendment 1447) to 15 U.S.C. §1244. This amendment provides that the Switchblade Knife Act shall not apply to &quot;spring-assist&quot; or &quot;assisted-opening&quot; knives (i.e. knives with closure-biased springs that require physical force applied to the blade to assist in opening the knife).

==Legality==

===Austria===
Beginning with the Austrian Arms Act of 1996 switchblades, like all other knives, are generally legal to buy, import, possess or carry, regardless of blade length or opening or locking mechanism. The only exception are minors (defined as persons under the age of 18) and people who have been expressly banned from owning and carrying any weapon (&quot;Waffenverbot&quot;): both groups may only possess knives which are not considered &quot;weapons&quot; under the Arms Act, defined as &quot;objects that by their very nature are intended to reduce or eliminate the defensive ability of a person through direct impact&quot;. Switchblades usually fall under that definition.

In Austria the regulatory laws of individual states and the Assembly Act prohibit switchblades and other knives from being carried into a public building, school, public assembly, or public event.

===Australia===
In Australia, switchblades are banned by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations as a Prohibited Import. Australian customs refer to the automatic knife or switchblade as a flick knife. Australian law defines a flick knife as a knife that has a blade which opens automatically by gravity, by centrifugal force, or by any pressure applied to a button, spring or device in or attached to the handle of the knife, a definition that would cover not only switchblades and automatic-opening knives, but also gravity knives and balisongs.

At a state and local level, most jurisdictions declare flick knives to be prohibited weapons in their respective acts, codes and regulations. Persons residing in states that do not have specific weapons legislation covering switchblades (such as Tasmania) are still covered by Federal Customs legislation, but in conditions where the state has no legislation against such items, an exemption may be applied for and received if approved by the chief supervisory officer of the police service in that state.

Some states which have specific legislation against switchblades allow individuals to apply for an exemption from this legislation if they have a legitimate reason. For example, in the state of Victoria, a member of a &quot;bona fide&quot; knife-collectors&#x27; association, who is not a prohibited person (per the Firearms Act 1996), and meets other guidelines and conditions may apply to the Chief Commissioner of Police for a Prohibited Weapons Exemption to possess, carry, or otherwise own such a knife. This exemption may then, in turn, be used to apply to the Australian Customs Service for an import permit.

===Belgium===
Article 3, §1 of the 2006 Weapons Act lists the switchblade or automatic knife (&quot;couteaux à cran d&#x27;arrêt et à lame jaillissante&quot;) as a prohibited weapon. In Belgium, the police and local jurisdictions are also allowed to prohibit the carrying or possession of a wide variety of knives, which are not explicitly banned by law, if the owner cannot establish a legitimate reason (&quot;motif légitime&quot;) for having that knife, particularly in urban areas or at public events.

===Canada===
Under Part III of the Criminal Code a knife that has a blade that opens automatically by gravity or centrifugal force or by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife, is illegal to possess, import, sell, buy, trade, or carry on one&#x27;s person. These are prohibited weapons (&quot;armes défendues&quot;). While certain businesses can be granted a licence to acquire and possess prohibited weapons such as switchblades for use as props in movie productions, these exemptions do not apply to individuals.

===Czech Republic===
It is legal to carry and possess switchblades or automatic knives in the Czech Republic.

===Denmark===
Any type of automatic-opening knife or bladed tool that can be opened using just one hand (this includes any one-handed knife that has been deactivated by removing its opening mechanism) is illegal to own or possess. Multi-tools featuring one-hand opening blades are also illegal to own or possess. Manually opened one-handed knives are legal.

===Finland===
In Finland switchblade or automatic knives are legal to purchase or possess. All knives are considered as dangerous weapons and it is forbidden to carry any knife without a proper cause. The law forbids carrying or importing any automatic knife that has the blade completely hidden like OTF switchblades. The restriction does not apply to importing historically significant knives or those with significant artistic value. The law requires that switchblades be cased and secured while being transported.

===France===
French law defines switchblades as dangerous weapons, which may not be carried on one&#x27;s person. If carried in a vehicle, such knives must be placed in a secure, locked compartment not accessible to the vehicle occupants. In addition, French law provides that authorities may classify any knife as a prohibited item depending upon circumstances and the discretion of the police or judicial authorities.

===Germany===
The switchblade is known in Germany as the &quot;Springmesser&quot; (also called a &quot;Sprenger&quot; or &quot;Springer&quot;). All large side-opening switchblade knives (blade longer than ), OTF switchblades, balisongs or butterfly knives (blade longer than ), and gravity knives are illegal to own, import or export under German law. Side-opening switchblade knives with single-edged blades not longer than and incorporating a continuous spine are legal to own. Legal switchblades may be carried both open and concealed on one&#x27;s person if there is a justified need for it (&quot;berechtigtes Bedürfnis&quot;) or if the weapon cannot be accessed with less than 3 moves (&quot;Transport in verschlossenem Behältnis&quot;). Other laws or regulations may still prohibit the carrying of otherwise legal automatic or switchblade knives, particularly in certain situations or places (gatherings on public ground, check-in areas of airports).

===Hungary===
According to decree 175/2003. (X. 28.) of the Hungarian government &quot;a közbiztonságra különösen veszélyes eszközökről&quot; (about the instruments particularly hazardous to public safety), it is prohibited to possess a switchblade in public places or private places open to the public – that includes the inside of vehicles present there – and on public transport vehicles, except for filmmaking and theatrical performances. Members of the Hungarian Army, law enforcement, national security agencies and armed forces stationed in Hungary are exempt from this limitation together with those who are authorised to carry such instruments by legislation. Sale of a switchblade is authorised only to the persons and organizations above. Customs clearance of switchblades may not be performed for private individuals such as tourists.

===Hong Kong===
According to the Weapons Ordinance (Cap. 217), any person who has possession of any prohibited items (including Gravity Knife and Flick Knife) commits an offence.

===Ireland===
Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 makes it an offence to carry a &quot;flick knife&quot; in any public space without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. A summary conviction is punishable with either a €1000 fine, up to 12 months imprisonment or both but if indictable the penalty can be up to five years in prison. The Act, which classifies a flick knife as an offensive weapon, also prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan of these knives. Conviction for any of these offences carries a sentence of up to seven years imprisonment.

===Italy===
In Italy, the switchblade or automatic opening knife (&quot;coltello a scatto&quot;) is generally defined as an &quot;arma bianca&quot; (offensive weapon) rather than a tool. While legal for adults to purchase, such knives may not be transported outside of one&#x27;s property nor carried on the person, either concealed or unconcealed, nor may it be carried in a motor vehicle where the knife may be accessed by driver or passengers. The Italian Ministry of Interior has warned that switchblade knives will be considered offensive weapons in their own right.

===Japan===
In Japan any switchblade over in blade length requires permission from the prefectural public safety commission in order to possess at home. However, switchblades and assisted open knives are prohibited from carry under any circumstances.

===Lithuania===
According to Lithuanian law it is illegal to carry or possess a switchblade if it meets one of the following criteria: the blade is longer than ; the width in the middle of the blade is less than 14% of its total length; the blade is double sided.

===Mexico===
It is legal to carry and possess switchblades in Mexico.

===Netherlands===
As of 2012, it is prohibited to own or possess, whether kept at home or not, any stilettos, switchblades, folding knives with more than one cutting edge, and throwing knives.

===New Zealand===
The Customs Import Prohibition Order 2008 prohibits the importation of &quot;any knife having a blade that opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife (sometimes known as a &#x27;flick-knife&#x27; or &#x27;flick gun&#x27;)&quot;. The Summary Offences Act 1981 and the Crimes Act 1961 section 202A(4)(a) make it an offence to possess any weapon in a public place without reasonable excuse.

===Norway===
Switchblades or automatic knives (&quot;springkniver&quot;) may not be acquired, possessed, or carried in Norway &quot;without justifiable purpose&quot; and also assuming they &quot;appear as products of violence&quot;.

===Poland===
Knives, including switchblades, although regarded as dangerous tools, are not considered weapons under Polish law, except for blades hidden in umbrellas, canes, etc. It is legal to sell, buy, trade and possess a switchblade, and Polish law does not prohibit carrying a knife in a public place. However, certain prohibitions may apply during mass events.

===Russia===
In Russia, switchblades (rus. &quot;автоматический нож&quot;, &quot;выкидной нож&quot;, &quot;пружинный нож&quot;) are illegal only if their blade&#x27;s length is more than – this is an illegal weapon, and there is a fine 500–2000 Russian rubles (about $8–30) and withdrawing of the knife only for carrying it (article 20.8 of Offences Code of Russia), but not for illegal purchasing and possession (keeping at home or somewhere else). Only self-making and selling white arms (rus. &quot;холодное оружие&quot;) is a crime in Russia (these two crimes are punished by: part 4 article 222 and part 4 article 223 of Russian Criminal Code). If the blade is shorter than 9 centimetres, anyone (even if people younger than 18 years old, having a criminal history or mental illness) can buy, own and concealed carry (open carry of any weapon or things that look like weapon at human settlements is forbidden in Russia; with the exception for policemen) such a switchblade without any license. But even in this case, it is recommended that people carry on their person an official certificate (type approval) (which is usually in a box with a purchased knife), which proves that it is not a melee weapon and not restricted to carry, in which case even knives longer than 9 cm are sometimes approved.

===Singapore===
The importation and possession of switchblades are illegal in Singapore. It may not be also listed or sold in auctions in Singapore.

===Slovenia===
Switchblades are specifically prohibited under Slovenian law.

===Slovakia===
It is legal to carry and possess switchblade or automatic knives with no restriction to the length of the blade.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, little to no laws exist on the possession, sale, manufacture, and carrying of weapons, other than firearms. Switchblades are legal for possession, sale, manufacture, and carrying.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, any knife that automatically opens wider than 45 degrees with the push of a button and has a blade that is longer than is subject to registration. In order to register the knife and legally possess it, one must be older than 20, have no previous criminal offences and be healthy both physically and psychologically. The registration process is carried out at nearby police stations. However, unless the owner of the knife has a hunting license, carrying the knife in public is generally prohibited.

===Spain===
Manufacture, importation, trade, use and possession of switchblade knives are prohibited in Spain.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the possession of any knife in a public place, at school, or public roads is prohibited. Exceptions are made for those who carry knives for professional or otherwise justified reasons. Switchblades may not be possessed by individuals under 21 years of age.

===Switzerland===
Knives whose blade can be opened with an automatic mechanism that can be operated with one hand are illegal to acquire (except with a special permit) in Switzerland under the Federal Weapons Act. Butterfly knives, throwing knives and daggers with a symmetrical blade are banned likewise. Violations are punishable with imprisonment of up to three years or a fiscal penalty, as provided for by article 33 of the same act.

===Turkey===
Switchblades are illegal to buy, sell and carry in Turkey per the corresponding law 6136 (4) which includes an incarceration sentence of up to 1 year. However, due to the widespread use of switchblades and butterfly knives in the country, imprisoning is very rare and sentences are often converted to a fine when it is the only violation.

===Ukraine===
Under Article 263 of the Criminal Code, switchblades are not specifically prohibited; however, any knife definable as a &#x27;dagger&#x27; may not be manufactured, sold, repaired for sale, nor carried on one&#x27;s person without a valid permit.

===United Kingdom===
On 12 May 1958, Parliament passed the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, which banned the manufacture, sale or offer to sell or hire any type of automatic-opening or switchblade knife. The law came in response to their perceived use by juvenile delinquents and gangs and associated media coverage, as well as by the 1958 passage of the Switchblade Knife Act in the United States. Indeed, much of the language in the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 appears to be taken directly from the American law.

In 2019, parliamentary amendments to Section 43, 44, and 46 of The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 make it illegal to own, possess, sell or transfer a switchblade or flick knife within the United Kingdom, including possession at home. According to UK government websites, assisted-opening knives are included in the amended and expanded definition of a prohibited &#x27;flick knife&#x27;.

===United States===
==== Federal law ====
The &quot;Switchblade Knife Act&quot; (, , aka &quot;SWA&quot;, enacted on August 12, 1958, and codified in ), prohibits the manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, and sale of switchblade knives in commercial transactions substantially affecting interstate commerce between any state, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and any place outside that state, territory, U.S. possession, or the District of Columbia. The Act also prohibits possession of such knives on federal or Indian lands or on lands subject to federal jurisdiction. The federal SWA does &quot;not&quot; prohibit the ownership or carrying of automatic knives or switchblades inside state lines while not on federal property, nor does it prohibit the acquisition or disposition of such knives in an intrastate (in-state) transaction. Finally, the law does not prohibit interstate knife sales or transactions that are either noncommercial in nature, or which do not substantially affect interstate commerce (as defined by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court).

U.S. Code Title 15, Sect. 1241 defines switchblade knives as any knives which open &quot;1) by hand pressure applied to a button or other device in the handle of the knife, or any knife having a blade which opens automatically; (2) by operation of inertia, gravity, or both&quot;. The Act also prohibits the manufacture, sale, or possession of switchblade knives on any Federal lands, Native American reservations, military bases, and Federal maritime or territorial jurisdictions including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories. The act was amended in 1986 to also prohibit the importation, sale, manufacture, or possession of ballistic knives in interstate commerce.

U.S.C. 1716 prohibits the mailing or transport of switchblades or automatic knives through the U.S. mails (U.S. Postal Service), with a few designated exceptions. The act provides for a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than one year. provides:

 provides that the federal &quot;Switchblade Knife Act&quot; does not apply to: 1) any common carrier or contract carrier, with respect to any switchblade knife shipped, transported, or delivered for shipment in interstate commerce in the ordinary course of business; 2) the manufacture, sale, transportation, distribution, possession, or introduction into interstate commerce of switchblade knives pursuant to contract with the Armed Forces; 3) to the Armed Forces or any member or employee thereof acting in the performance of his duty; 4) the possession and transportation upon his person of any switchblade knife with a blade or less in length by any individual who has only one arm, and 5) a knife &quot;that contains a spring, detent, or other mechanism designed to create a bias toward closure of the blade and that requires exertion applied to the blade by hand, wrist, or arm to overcome the bias toward closure to assist in opening the knife&quot;.

====State laws====
In addition to federal law, some U.S. states have laws restricting or prohibiting automatic knives or switchblades, sometimes as part of a catchall category of &quot;deadly weapons&quot; or &quot;prohibited weapons&quot;. A few states, among them Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey, New Mexico, and New York, prohibit sale, transfer, ownership or possession of automatic knives or switchblades as deadly or prohibited weapons, while others such as New Hampshire and Arizona have no restrictions on sale, ownership, possession, or carry (with some location-specific exceptions). Other states allow purchase, possession, and carrying on one&#x27;s person to a limited degree, sometimes with restrictions on blade length or location.

The negative public reputation of the switchblade as the tool of the juvenile delinquent, derived from sensational media coverage of the 1950s, was enshrined in many states&#x27; criminal codes, and some of these laws persist to this day. Thus in some states, the possession or carrying of an automatic-opening knife or switchblade may become illegal based solely on its design or aesthetic appearance, or simply its use as a weapon in a given circumstance. For example, switchblade knives with blade shapes originally designed for the purpose of stabbing or thrusting, such as the dirk, dagger, poignard, or stiletto are automatically considered to be &#x27;deadly weapons&#x27; (i.e. knives designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon to inflict death or serious bodily injury).

Over the years, state judicial decisions have expanded the original reach of switchblade laws, either by reclassifying single-edged automatic pocket knives with short, general-purpose blades as illegal &#x27;dirks or daggers&#x27;, or by re-defining otherwise legal manually-operated lock-blade pocket knives as a prohibited gravity knife, flick knife, or switchblade. Persons who used knives deemed prohibited as in their work or for self-defense, or who could not afford adequate legal representation, particularly racial minorities, have been disproportionately affected by the capricious enforcement of such laws.

In response to complaints raised about the constitutionality and inconsistent application of existing statutes to modern knife designs, several states such as Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have repealed older laws against possession or purchase of switchblade or automatic knives. Five states still prohibit anyone from selling, purchasing, owning or carrying a switchblade.

In August 2024, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court relied on the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot; when it struck down a 1957 ban on switchblade knives in the state, on the grounds there were no similar bans at the time of the writing of the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. This may mean other switchblade laws at the federal and state level will be ruled unconstitutional.

====City and county ordinances====
Unless preempted by state law, various county, city, or other local jurisdictions may also have their own codes or ordinances further restricting or prohibiting switchblade possession or use, for example Sioux Falls, South Dakota, or Oakland, California.

== History ==
Switchblades date from the mid-18th century. The development of the first automatic knife was made possible by the invention of small tempered springs by the clockmaker Benjamin Huntsman in 1742.

The first spring-fired switchblade that can be authenticated appeared in the late 1700s, probably constructed by a craftsman in Italy. After 1816, no automatic knives were produced in Italy for 50 years due to laws passed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1900, Italy had resumed production of automatic knives of the [stiletto] pattern, all hand-crafted by individual cutlers or small knife forges. Most of these knifemakers were concentrated in the towns of Maniago, Frosolone, Campobasso, and Scarperia.

Unknown artisans developed an automatic folding spike bayonet for use on flintlock pistols and coach guns. Examples of steel automatic folding knives from Sheffield England have crown markings that date to 1840. Cutlery makers such as Tillotson, A. Davey, Beever, Hobson, Ibbotson and others produced automatic-opening knives. Some have simple iron bolsters and wooden handles, while others feature ornate, embossed silver alloy bolsters and stag handles. English-made knives often incorporate a &quot;pen release&quot; instead of a central handle button, whereby the main spring activated larger blade is released by pressing down on the closed smaller pen blade.

In France, 19th-century folding knives marked &quot;Châtellerault&quot; were available in both automatic and manually opened versions in several sizes and lengths. &quot;Châtellerault&quot; switchblades have recognizable features such as S-shaped cross guards, picklock type mechanisms and engraved decorative pearl and ivory handles. In Spain, Admiral D&#x27;Estaing is attributed with a type of folding naval dirk that doubled as an eating utensil. In closed (folded) position, the blade tip would extend beyond the handle to be used at the dining table. It could be spring activated to full length if needed as a side arm, by pressing a lever instead of a handle button. By 1850, at least one American company offered a .22 rimfire single-shot pistol equipped with a spring-operated knife. After the American Civil War (1865), knife production became industrialized. The oldest American made mass-production automatic knife is the &quot;Korn Patent Knife&quot;, which used a rocking bolster release.

The advent of mass production methods enabled folding knives with multiple components to be produced in large numbers at lower cost. By 1890, US knife sales of all types were on the increase, buoyed by catalog mail order sales as well as mass marketing campaigns utilizing advertisements in periodicals and newspapers. In consequence, knife manufacturers began marketing new and much more affordable automatic knives to the general public. In Europe as well as the United States, automatic knife sales were never more than a fraction of sales generated by conventional folding knives, yet the type enjoyed consistent if modest sales from year to year.

In 1892, George Schrade, a toolmaker and machinist from New York City developed and patented the first of several practical automatic knife designs. The following year, Schrade founded the New York Press Button Knife Company to manufacture his switchblade knife pattern, which had a unique release button mounted in the knife bolster. Schrade&#x27;s company operated out of a small workshop in New York City and employed about a dozen workmen.

===1900–1945===
Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, developed a market in the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early French &quot;Châtellerault&quot; knife. Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic knives marked &quot;Campobasso&quot; or &quot;Frosolone&quot; were often called &quot;Flat Guards&quot; because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a blade lock release activated by prying up a locking flange at the hinge end, and were known as &quot;picklock&quot; models. These knives were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the blade lock release into a tilting bolster.

In Italy, increased production of automatic knives resulted from the actions of German businessman Albert Marx, who owned two cutlery manufacturing concerns in Solingen, Germany. After a trip to Maniago in 1907, Marx was convinced of the appeal of Italian style automatic knives, and duly took note of attempts by Maniago knifemakers to increase productivity using powered cutting tools. Marx promptly introduced the Solingen methods of semi-mass production to the Maniago knife industry, increasing output and lowering individual costs. While Italian automatic knives would remain hand-assembled and to some extent hand-crafted products, Marx&#x27;s innovations did increase production, enabling exports to other parts of Italy and eventually throughout Europe and abroad. Over time, Maniago became the central hub of automatic knife production in Italy.

In the United States, commercial development of the switchblade knife was primarily dominated by the inventions of George Schrade and his &quot;New York Press Button Knife Company&quot;, though &quot;W.R. Case&quot;, &quot;Union Cutlery&quot;, &quot;Camillus Cutlery&quot;, and other U.S. knife manufacturers also marketed automatic knives of their own design. Most of Schrade&#x27;s switchblade patterns were automatic versions of utilitarian jackknives and pocket knives, as well as smaller penknife models designed to appeal to women buyers. In 1903, Schrade sold his interest in the New York Press Button Knife Co. to the Walden Knife Co., and moved to Walden, New York, where he opened a new factory. There Schrade became the company&#x27;s production superintendent, establishing a production line to manufacture several patterns of Schrade-designed switchblade knives, ranging from a large folding hunter to a small pocket knife. Walden Knife Co. would go on to sell thousands of copies of Schrade&#x27;s original bolster button design.

The advertising campaigns of the day by Schrade and other automatic knife manufacturers focused on marketing to farmers, ranchers, hunters, or outdoors men who needed a compact pocket knife that could be quickly brought into action when needed. In rural areas of America, these campaigns were partially successful, particularly with younger buyers, who aspired to own the most modern tools at a time when new labor-saving inventions were constantly appearing on the market. Most American-made switchblades made after 1900 were patterned after standard utilitarian pocketknives, though a few larger &quot;Bowie&quot; or &quot;Folding Hunter&quot; patterns were produced with blade shapes and lengths that could be considered useful as fighting knives. Most had flat or sabre-ground clip or spear-point blade profiles and single-sharpened edges. Blade lengths rarely exceeded . A few manufacturers introduced the double switchblade, featuring two blades that could be automatically opened and locked with the push of a button.

At the low end of the market, &quot;Shapleigh Hardware Company&quot; of St. Louis, Missouri contracted thousands of switchblades under the trademark &quot;Diamond Edge&quot; for distribution to dealers across the United States and Canada. Most of these knives were novelty items, assembled at the lowest possible cost. Sold off display cards in countless hardware and general stores, many low-end &quot;Diamond Edge&quot; switchblades failed to last more than a few months in actual use. Other companies such as Imperial Knife and Remington Arms paid royalties to Schrade in order to produce automatic &quot;contract knives&quot; for rebranding and sale by large mail-order catalog retailers such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.

In 1904, in combination with his brothers Louis and William, George Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Co. in Walden, and began developing a new series of switchblades, which he patented in 1906–07. Schrade&#x27;s new &quot;Safety Pushbutton Knives&quot; incorporated several design improvements over his earlier work, and featured a handle-mounted operating button with a sliding safety switch. A multi-blade operating button allowed the knife to operate with up to four automatic blades. In successive patents from 1906 through 1916 Schrade would steadily improve this design, which would later become known as the &quot;Presto&quot; series. With the &quot;Presto&quot; line, Schrade would largely dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next forty years. Schrade would go on to manufacture thousands of contract switchblade knives under several trademarks and brands, including &quot;E. Weck&quot;, &quot;Wade &amp; Butcher&quot;, and &quot;Case XX&quot;, while other companies used Schrade&#x27;s patent as the basis for their own switchblade patterns. Among these were pocket and folding hunter pattern switchblades bearing the name &quot;Keen Kutter&quot;, a trademark owned by E.C. Simmons Hardware Co. (later purchased by the Shapleigh Hardware Co.).

Having earned a handsome return from his work, Schrade traveled to Europe in 1911, first to Sheffield, England, where he assisted &quot;Thomas Turner &amp; Company&quot; in expediting a wartime order from the British Navy. He next moved to the knifemaking center of Solingen, Germany. Schrade was aware of Solingen&#x27;s reputation for having the best cutlery steel in Europe, and he opened a factory to produce his safety pushbutton switchblade knife there. In 1915 or 1916 Schrade sold his Solingen holdings (some sources state they were seized by the German government) and returned to the United States.

In 1918, Captain Rupert Hughes of the U.S. Army submitted a patent application for a specialized automatic-opening trench knife of his own design, the &quot;Hughes Trench Knife&quot;. This was a curious device consisting of a folding spring-loaded knife blade attached to a handle which fastened to the back of the hand and was secured by a leather strap, leaving the palm and fingers free for grasping other objects. Pressing a button on the handle automatically extended a knife blade into an open position and locked position, allowing the knife to be used as a stabbing weapon. The &quot;Hughes Trench Knife&quot; was evaluated as a potential military arm by a panel of U.S. Army officers from the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in June 1918. After testing the board found the &quot;Hughes&quot; design to be of no value, and it was never adopted. Hughes went on to patent his automatic trench knife in 1919, though Hughes appears to have been unsuccessful in persuading a knife manufacturing company to produce his design.

From 1923 to 1951, the &quot;Union Cutlery Co.&quot; of Olean, New York produced a series of lever-operated switchblades designed for the mid and upper end of the market, featuring celluloid, stag, or jigged bone handles, a bolster-mounted push-button, all featuring the company&#x27;s &quot;KA-BAR&quot; trademark on the blade tang. The line included the &quot;KA-BAR Grizzly&quot;, &quot;KA-BAR Baby Grizzly&quot;, and &quot;KA-BAR Model 6110 Lever Release&quot; knives. The largest model was &quot;KA-BAR Grizzly&quot;, a folding hunter pattern with a broad bowie-type clip point blade.
Upon returning to the United States, Schrade made a final improvement to his &quot;Presto&quot; series of switchblades, filing his patent application on June 6, 1916. The next year, Schrade licensed a new flylock switchblade design to the &quot;Challenge Cutlery Company&quot;, which he then joined. Under the trademark of &quot;Flylock Knife Co.&quot;, Challenge made several patterns of the flylock switchblade, including a large folding hunter model with hinged floating guard and a small pen knife model designed to appeal to women buyers. A Challenge Cutlery advertisement of the day depicted a female hand operating a fly-lock automatic pen knife, accompanied by a caption urging women to buy one for their sewing kit so as not to break a nail while attempting to open a normal pen knife. Schrade pursued his knifemaking interests at both Challenge and at Schrade, where his brother George now managed one of the company&#x27;s factories.

With a few ex-Challenge employees Schrade formed a second company, the &quot;Geo. Schrade Knife Company&quot;, primarily to manufacture his &quot;Presto&quot; series of switchblade knives. In 1937, Schrade came out with two more low-cost switchblade knives designed to appeal to youth, the &quot;Flying Jack&quot; and the &quot;Pull-Ball Knife&quot;. The &quot;Flying Jack&quot; had a sliding operating latch and could be produced with one or more automatically opening blades. The &quot;Pull-Ball&quot; opened by pulling a ball located on the butt end of the handle. Schrade would later manufacture alternative configurations to the ball operating handle, including dice, rings, eight balls, or different colors. The &quot;Pull-Ball&quot; required two hands to open, removing much of the switchblade&#x27;s utility as a one-handed knife. As the blade catch mechanism required a good deal of space within the handle, the knife&#x27;s blade length was short relative to its handle length. Schrade manufactured many pull-ball knives for sale under other brands, including Remington, Case, and the &quot;J.C.N. Co.&quot; (&quot;Jewelry Cutlery Novelty Company&quot; of North Attleboro, Massachusetts) Always looking for a new way to appeal to customers, Schrade continued to experiment with new forms of switchblade designs up to the time of his death in 1940.

In the late 1930s the German Luftwaffe began training a &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; or paratroop force, and as part of this effort developed specialized equipment for the airborne soldier, including the &quot;Fallschirmjäger-Messer&quot; (paratrooper&#x27;s knife), which used a gravity-operated mechanism to deploy its sliding spearpoint blade from the handle. The German paratrooper knife, which featured a marlinspike in addition to the cutting blade, was used to cut rigging and unknot lines, though it could be employed as a weapon in an emergency. The U.S. Army in 1940 tasked the &quot;Geo. Schrade Knife Co.&quot; to produce a small single-edge switchblade for U.S. airborne troops, to be used similarly to the &quot;Fallschirmjäger-Messer&quot;. The knife was not intended primarily as a fighting knife, but rather as a utility tool, to enable a paratrooper to rapidly cut himself out of his lines and harness in the event he could not escape them after landing.

The company&#x27;s submission was approved by the U.S. Army Materiel Command in December 1940 as the &quot;Knife, Pocket, M2&quot;. The M2 had a clip-point blade and featured a carrying bail. Except for the bail, the M2 was for all intents and purposes a copy of George Schrade&#x27;s popular &quot;Presto&quot; safety-button civilian model. The M-2 was issued primarily to U.S. Army paratroopers during the war, though some knives appear to have been distributed to crews and members of the Office of Strategic Services. When issued to paratroopers, the M2 was normally carried in the dual-zippered knife pocket on the upper chest of the M42 jump uniform jacket. After the war, the M2 was manufactured by Schrade (now &quot;Schrade-Walden, Inc.&quot;) as the &quot;Parachutist&#x27;s Snap Blade Knife&quot; (MIL-K-10043) under a postwar military contract. In addition, other companies such as the &quot;Colonial Knife Co.&quot; made civilian versions of the M2 after the war.

===Postwar usage and the Italian stiletto===

From the end of World War II until 1958, most U.S.-manufactured switchblades were manufactured by Schrade (now &quot;Schrade-Walden, Inc.&quot;, a division of &quot;Imperial Knife Co.&quot;), and the Colonial Knife Co.

Schrade-Walden Inc. made knives under the &quot;Schrade-Walden&quot; trademark, while Colonial made a number of mass-produced switchblade patterns during the 1950s under the trademark &quot;Shur Snap&quot;. Designed to a price point, &quot;Shur Snap&quot; switchblades feature stamped plated sheet-metal bolsters and plastic scales.

In 1956, the U.S. Air Force requested development for a new aircrew knife with several requirements, including the ability to be opened with one hand. The final result was the &quot;MC-1 Aircrew Survival Knife&quot;. A development of the WW2-era M2 Parachutist Snap Blade knife, the MC-1 featured twin blades, The main blade was a blunt line-cutting blade with a protected sharpened inside edge for severing parachute lines, while the secondary blade opened automatically with a push button in the event the crew member could use only one hand. First issued in 1958, the MC-1 was restricted to U.S. military sales only, and was produced by the Camillus Cutlery Co., Logan/Smyth of Venice Florida, and Schrade-Walden Inc.. The last production contract for the MC-1 was cancelled in 1993.

After 1945, American soldiers returning home from Europe brought along individually purchased examples of the Italian style of stiletto pattern switchblade produced in Maniago and other cutlery towns. Though undeniably limited in practical usefulness, the style and beauty of the so-called stiletto switchblade was a revelation to US buyers accustomed to the utilitarian nature of most U.S.-made automatic knives such as the Schrade &quot;Presto&quot; pocketknife. Consumer demand for more of these knives resulted in the importation of large numbers of side-opening and telescoping blade switchblades, primarily from Italy. In the case of the switchblade, the name stiletto derives from the blade design, since most Italian designs incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard reminiscent of the medieval weapon. The majority of these stiletto pattern switchblade knives used a now-iconic slender bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-ground edge and an opposing false edge. Other blade styles included the double-edged dagger and the curved-edge kris. Some were flimsy souvenirs made for tourists or novelty purchasers, while others were made with solid materials and workmanship. Eventually, many thousands of Italian switchblades were exported to the US. Around this time, the traditional Italian switchblade &#x27;picklock&#x27; method of blade release was largely replaced by the tilt bolster mechanism, ending the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of hand-crafted Italian switchblades.

As with the medieval stiletto upon which it was based, the so-called stiletto switchblade was intended to be a concealable weapon optimized for thrusting rather than cutting or slashing (many imported stiletto switchblades had no sharpened cutting edge at all). These knives ranged in blade length from . As a weapon, the stiletto switchblade was much less effective than most fixed-blade hunting and military knives commonly available in the US, including the Bowie knife and dagger, which could inflict deep slashing cuts as well as stab wounds. However, its peculiar properties of easy concealment and rapid blade deployment appealed to some, and as with any other knife, the stiletto switchblade could inflict a severe wound, given sufficient blade length.

===1950s gang usage and controversy===
In 1950, an article titled &quot;The Toy That Kills&quot; appeared in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;, a widely read U.S. periodical of the day. The article sparked a storm of controversy and a nationwide campaign that would eventually result in state and federal laws criminalizing the importation, sale, and possession of automatic-opening knives. In the article, author Jack Harrison Pollack assured the reader that the growing switchblade &quot;menace&quot; could have deadly consequence &quot;as any crook can tell you&quot;. Pollack, a former aide to Democratic Senator Harley M. Kilgore and a ghostwriter for then-Senator Harry S Truman, had authored a series of melodramatic magazine articles calling for new laws to address a variety of social ills. In &quot;The Toy That Kills&quot;, Pollack wrote that the switchblade was &quot;Designed for violence, deadly as a revolver - that&#x27;s the switchblade, the &#x27;toy&#x27; youngsters all over the country are taking up as a fad. Press the button on this new version of the pocketknife and the blade darts out like a snake&#x27;s tongue. Action against this killer should be taken now&quot;. To back up his charges, Pollack quoted an unnamed juvenile court judge as saying: &quot;It&#x27;s only a short step from carrying a switchblade to gang warfare&quot;.

During the 1950s, established U.S. newspapers as well as the sensationalist tabloid press joined forces in promoting the image of a young delinquent with a stiletto switchblade or flick knife. While the press focused on the switchblade as a symbol of youthful evil intent, the American public&#x27;s attention was attracted by lurid stories of urban youth gang warfare and the fact that many gangs were composed of lower class youth and/or racial minorities. The purported offensive nature of the stiletto switchblade combined with reports of knife fights, robberies, and stabbings by youth gangs and other criminal elements in urban areas of the United States generated continuing demands from newspaper editorial rooms and the public for new laws restricting the lawful possession and/or use of switchblade knives - with particular emphasis on racial minorities, especially African-American and Hispanic teens. In 1954, the state of New York passed the first law banning the sale or distribution of switchblade knives in hopes of reducing gang violence. That same year, Democratic Rep. James J. Delaney of New York authored the first bill submitted to the U.S. Congress banning the manufacture and sale of switchblades.

Some U.S. congressmen saw the switchblade controversy as a political opportunity to capitalize on constant negative accounts of the switchblade knife and its connection to violence and youth gangs. This coverage included not only magazine articles but also highly popular films of the late 1950s including &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955), &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot; (1956), &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), &quot;The Delinquents&quot; (1957), &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), and the 1957 Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Hollywood&#x27;s fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence, sex, and delinquency resulted in renewed demands from the public and Congress to control the sale and possession of such knives. State laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures.

In 1957, Senator Estes Kefauver (D) of Tennessee attempted unsuccessfully to pass a law restricting the importation and possession of switchblade knives. Opposition to the bill from the U.S. knife making industry was muted, with the exception of the &quot;Colonial Knife Co.&quot; and &quot;Schrade-Walden Inc.&quot;, which were still manufacturing small quantities of pocket switchblades for the U.S. market. Some in the industry even supported the legislation, hoping to gain market share at the expense of Colonial and Schrade. However, the legislation failed to receive expected support from the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Justice, which considered the legislation unenforceable and an unwarranted intrusion into lawful sales in interstate commerce.

While Kefauver&#x27;s bill failed, a new U.S. Senate bill prohibiting the importation or possession of switchblade knives in interstate commerce was introduced the following year by Democratic Senator Peter F. Mack Jr. of Illinois in an attempt to reduce gang violence in Chicago and other urban centers in the state. With youth violence and delinquency aggravated by the severe economic recession, Mack&#x27;s bill was enacted by Congress and signed into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.

The melodrama created by US media towards the stiletto switchblade had its effect in Canada and the United Kingdom. The US Switchblade Knife Act was closely followed by the UK Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act of 1959. In Canada, Parliament amended the Criminal Code in 1959 to include all new-production automatic knives as prohibited weapons - banned from importation, sale or possession within that country.

The new laws treated all automatic-opening knives as a prohibited class, even knives with utility or general-purpose blades not generally used by criminals. Curiously, the sale and possession of stilettos and other &#x27;offensive&#x27; knives with fixed or lockback blades were not prohibited. In other U.S. states, the sale and possession of switchblade knives remained legal, particularly in rural states where a significant proportion of the population possessed firearms. As late as 1968, Jack Pollack was still writing lurid articles demanding further federal legislation prohibiting the purchase or possession of switchblade knives. That same year, New York congressman Lester L. Wolff (D) even read one of Pollack&#x27;s articles into the U.S. Congressional Record while introducing legislation to further restrict the sale and transportation of switchblades, arguing that &#x27;switchblade knives have no redeeming social value and are restricted almost solely to violence&#x27;.

As an anti-violence measure, legislation against switchblade sales or use clearly failed in the United States, as youth street gangs increasingly turned from bats and knives to handguns, MAC-10s, and AK-47s to settle their disputes over territory as well as income from prostitution, extortion, and illicit drug sales. In fact, the U.S. murder rate using cutting or stabbing instruments of all types declined from 23% of all murders in 1965 to just 12% in 2012.

====1970-2000====
By the late 1960s, new production of switchblades in the United States was largely limited to military contract automatic knives such as the MC-1.

In Italy, switchblades known among collectors as &quot;Transitionals&quot; were made with a mix of modern parts and leftover old style parts.

Switchblade knives continued to be sold and collected in those states in which possession remained legal. In the 1980s, automatic knife imports to the U.S. resumed with the concept of kit knives, allowing the user to assemble a working switchblade from a parts kit with the addition of a mainspring or other key part (often sold separately). Since no law prohibited importation of switchblade parts or unassembled kits, all risk of prosecution was assumed by the assembling purchaser, not the importer. This loophole was eventually closed by new federal regulations.

====Present day====
The ability to purchase or carry switchblades or automatic knives continues to be heavily restricted or prohibited throughout much of Europe, with some notable exceptions. In Britain, the folding type of switchblade is commonly referred to as a flick knife. In the UK, knives with an automated opening system are nearly impossible to acquire or carry legally; although they can legally be owned, it is illegal to manufacture, sell, hire, give, lend, or import such knives. This definition would nominally restrict lawful ownership to &#x27;grandfathered&#x27; automatic knives already in possession by their owner prior to the enactment of the applicable law in 1959. Even when such a knife is legally owned, carrying it in public without good reason or lawful authority is also illegal under current UK laws.

Under US federal laws, switchblades remain illegal to import from abroad or to purchase through interstate commerce since 1958 under the old Switchblade Knife Act (15 U.S.C. §§1241-1245). In recent years, many U.S. states have repealed laws prohibiting the purchase or possession of automatic or switchblade knives in their entirety.

====Modern-day Switchblade Development====
Despite federal law, there are still a number of U.S. knife companies and custom makers who build automatic knives, primarily for use by the military and emergency personnel. Some well known present-day automatic knife manufacturers include &quot;Buck Knives&quot;, &quot;Colonial Knife Co.&quot;, &quot;Microtech Knives&quot;, &quot;Benchmade&quot;, &quot;Severtech&quot;, &quot;Gerber Legendary Blades&quot;, &quot;Mikov&quot;, &quot;Pro-Tech Knives&quot;, &quot;Dalton&quot;, &quot;Böker&quot;, &quot;Spyderco&quot;, &quot;Kershaw Knives&quot;, and &quot;Piranha&quot;. Colonial currently manufactures the M724 Automatic Rescue Knife, which is currently being issued for use in all U.S. military aircraft ejection seat survival kits.

The classic Italian-style stiletto switchblade continues to be produced in Italy, Taiwan, and China. Automatic knife manufacture in Italy consists predominantly as a cottage industry of family-oriented businesses. These include &quot;Frank Beltrame&quot; and &quot;AGA Campolin&quot;, who have been making automatic knives using hand assembly techniques for more than half a century. Since the late 1990s, the nations of Taiwan and China have emerged as large-scale producers of automatic knives.

Automatic or switchblade knives have been produced in the following countries: Argentina, China, Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and U.S.A..

<doc id="623102" wikidata="Q1303896" url="?curid=623102" title="Checker barb">
<text>The checker barb (Oliotius oligolepis) is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to creeks, rivers, and lakes in Sumatra, Indonesia. It has also been established in the wild in Colombia. The adult males have red fins with black tips. It will grow up to a length of TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Oliotius&quot; is derived as a combination of a portion of the specific epithet &quot;oligolepis&quot; and its former genus name &quot;Puntius&quot;.

The common name &quot;checker barb&quot; (as well as such related names as &quot;checkered barb&quot;, &quot;chequer barb&quot; and &quot;checkerboard barb&quot;) derives from the black marks on its side similar in appearance to those found on a checkerboard.

==Taxonomic issue==
This species has sometimes been placed in the genus &quot;Barbus&quot; though &quot;Barbus oligolepis&quot; properly refers to another fish species that is only found in Turkey. Since Bleeker&#x27;s &quot;oligolepis&quot; is not placed in &quot;Barbus&quot;, both names are valid.

==Habitat==
Checker barbs natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a pH of 6.0 - 6.5, a water hardness of 10.0 dGH, and a temperature range of . Their omnivorous diet consists of small worms, crustaceans, insects, and plants.

An egg-scattering fish, they spawn early in the morning on plants that are the center of the male&#x27;s territory. Once the spawning is completed, the pair will attempt to eat the eggs that they can find.

==In the aquarium==
The checker barb has commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry; this peaceful fish is sometimes used in community tanks by fish keeping hobbyists. The checker barb is a schooling fish that is well suited to a community aquarium. It requires warm (), soft to medium-hard water. It occupies the medium to lower levels of the aquarium and is an omnivore, doing well on processed foods. The checker barb is a prolific egg-scatterer that lends itself well to the novice breeder.

<text>Anthony Christian Meo (born 4 October 1959) is a retired English snooker player. He won the 1989 British Open by defeating Dean Reynolds 13–6 in the final, and was runner-up to Steve Davis at the 1984 Classic. He won four World Doubles Championship titles, partnering Davis, and the 1983 World Team Classic representing England alongside Davis and Tony Knowles.

He played snooker together with his schoolfriend Jimmy White as a teenager. Aged seventeen, Meo became the then-youngest person known to have made an unofficial maximum break of 147. He won the British under-19 title in 1978, as well as other junior titles. He turned professional in 1979, and won the 1981 Australian Masters, 1983 Thailand Masters and 1985 Australian Masters. He reached the final of the 1984 Lada Classic but lost in the . He took the 1986 English Professional Championship title, and retained it in 1987. He made a break of 147 in his 1988 Matchroom League match against Stephen Hendry, and won the 1990 International League.

He retired from professional play after the 1996–97 snooker season and became a wrist watch consultant. In 1986, Meo was one of five players under Barry Hearn&#x27;s management (along with Davis, Terry Griffiths, Willie Thorne and Dennis Taylor) who appeared on &quot;Snooker Loopy&quot;, a hit single about the game recorded with Chas &amp; Dave.

==Early life==
Anthony Christian Meo was born on 4 October 1959 in Tooting, London, and started playing snooker aged 13. He was a schoolfriend of Jimmy White at Ernest Bevin Comprehensive, and the pair regularly skipped school to play snooker together. When he was 15 (and White was 13), they were approached by &quot;Dodgy&quot; Bob Davis who arranged money matches for them and became their manager. The players later signed to be managed, alongside the leading London amateur Patsy Fagan, by Henry West. At 17, Meo became the then-youngest person known to have made an unofficial maximum break of 147.

==Amateur career==
Meo defeated White in the final to win the 1977 Pontins Junior title as well as taking the Warners Pro-Am title by winning against professional Doug Mountjoy 5–4 in the final. Meo took the British under-19 title in 1978 with a 3–1 victory against defending champion Ian Williamson in the final. At the 1978 Canadian Open, he achieved the most notable win of his career to that point by eliminating Alex Higgins in the semi-final, and led 10–6 in the final against Cliff Thorburn before losing the match 15–17. He won a second Warners Open title in 1979, 5–2 against White in the final.

==Professional career==
Meo turned professional in June 1979. At the 1979 Canadian Open he was seeded into the last 16, where he lost 7–9 to Jim Wych. He eliminated David Taylor from the 1979 UK Championship 9–7, and then lost to the eventual champion John Virgo 6–9 in the following round. He made his world championship debut at the 1980 World Snooker Championship, after progressing past Jimmy van Rensberg and Pat Houlihan (both 9–1) in qualifying. Facing Higgins, Meo was ahead after their first , and at 9–8 was a away from winning before Higgins took the last two frames with breaks of 77 and 62 to claim victory.

At the 1980 UK Championship, Meo eliminated defending champion Virgo 9–1 before losing to Steve Davis in the quarter-finals. The 1981 English Professional Championship saw Meo eliminate Virgo, Graham Miles and Willie Thorne to reach the final. Meo finished as runner-up, losing 3–9 to Davis. Meo recorded his third win against Virgo in the season with a 10–6 win at the 1981 World Snooker Championship, making a break of 134 during the match. In the second round, Meo finished his first session with Terry Griffiths at 4–4, but only won two of the next eleven frames, with Griffiths taking the match 13–6.

At the start of the 1981–82 snooker season, Meo won the 1981 Australian Masters, a short-format competition that saw two groups each of four professional players play one-frame round-robin matches, with the group winners then playing the final over three frames. He lost 3–9 to Griffiths in the semi-finals at the 1981 UK Championship after eliminating both Higgins and Thorburn. Davis and Meo won the 1982 World Doubles Championship. Meo also reached the semi-finals of the 1982 Masters. The 1982 UK Championship was a repeat of 1981 in that he reached the semi-finals and lost to Griffiths, this time 7–9. He reached the World Championship quarter-finals for the first time at the 1983 tournament, and finished the season by winning the 1983 Pontins Brean Sands tournament, with a 9–7 final victory against Silvino Francisco.

In the 1983–84 snooker season, he won the 1983 Thailand Masters, and was a semi-finalist at the 1983 Professional Players Tournament. In December 1983, Davis and Meo retained the World Doubles Championship. The following month, they faced each other in the final of the Lada Classic. Meo had reached the final by eliminating Rex Williams 5–3, Kirk Stevens 5–2 and Mark Wildman 5–3. After losing the first two frames in the final, Meo established a 4–2 lead, which was reduced to 4–3 after Davis won the concluding frame of the first session with a 122 . In the second session, Davis took the first four frames, compiling six breaks of 35 or more. Meo claimed the next four frames, to require just one more frame at 8–7, having recovered from more than 40 behind in both the 12th and 15th frames. Davis won the 16th frame with a break of 84 to force a . Davis built a lead of 38 points, but Meo recovered to 12 points behind with a break of 26. Meo only needed to clear the to win the title, but missed potting the after being distracted by a shout of &quot;Come on, Tony&quot; from a spectator. Davis went on to win the frame and match.

The non-ranking 1984 Malaysian Masters was the only final that Meo reached in 1984–85 snooker season, but he retained his ranking of tenth for 1985–86. He won the 1985 Australian Masters by defeating John Campbell 7–2 in the final, and the 1986 English Professional Championship. In the latter, he defeated Davis 9–7 in the semi-finals, his first victory over Davis in their eleven professional matches against each other. In the final, Meo led Neal Foulds 3–1, but the first session finished with the pair level at 3–3. Meo was a frame ahead at 4–3 and 5–4, with Foulds then taking the next two frames to lead for the first time in the match at 6–5. Meo added the 12th frame, but Foulds moved ahead again by claiming the 13th. Meo won the next three frames for a 9–7 victory, finishing with a break of 94 in the 16th frame.

The 1987 English Professional Championship saw him retain the title by defeating Les Dodd 9–5 in the final, but his ranking tournament performances in the 1986–87 snooker season meant he slipped from 11th to 20th place in the rankings, and his results in the following season saw him fall to 31st in the 1988/1989 rankings. He compiled a maximum break of 147 in his 1988 Matchroom League match against Stephen Hendry.

In the 1988–89 snooker season, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1988 International Open. At the 1989 British Open he eliminated Colin Roscoe 5–3, then the defending champion Hendry and Peter Francisco, each by the same scoreline. In the semi-final against Mike Hallett, Meo was two frames behind with three to play at 6–8. He won the 15th frame by a single point after requiring two , then added the next two frames to win 9–8. In the final, he played Dean Reynolds, and won each of the first two sessions 5–2, thus leading 10–4 by the third session. Reynolds reduced his deficit to 6–10, but Meo won the next three frames to claim victory at 13–6 and achieve his first ranking title victory. Before the tournament, he had been rated as a 200–1 outsider to win. In the post-match speeches, Reynolds complained that he had been &quot;totally bored&quot; by Meo&#x27;s cautious style of play. Meo acknowledged that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t very spectacular&quot; and added that he felt that it was &quot;the best tactical snooker&quot; that he had ever player.

Meo was a semi-finalist at the World Championship, losing 7–16 to John Parrott. His performances in ranking tournaments led to him moving up from 31st place to 14th in the rankings for the following season, during which he won the round-robin 1990 International League by winning four of his five matches, and drawing the other one. However, in the following years, he failed to reach as far as the quarter-finals in any ranking tournament, and his ranking fell one place to 15th, then out of the top 32. Meo was ranked 160th after the 1996–97 snooker season, but did not participate in any further tournaments in the following seasons. He became a wrist watch consultant.

In 1982, Meo signed up to be managed by Barry Hearn, Davis&#x27;s manager. With Davis, Meo won four World Doubles titles, and was also part of the victorious England team at the 1983 World Team Classic. In 1986, Meo was one of five players under Hearn&#x27;s management (along with Davis, Griffiths, Thorne and Dennis Taylor) who appeared on &quot;Snooker Loopy&quot;, a hit single about the game recorded with Chas &amp; Dave. He was nicknamed &quot;The Cat&quot; and &quot;Meo, Meo&quot;. The highest ranking that he attained was tenth.

==Personal life==
By 1981, Meo had married Denise, and in 1991 they had their fourth child. After retiring from snooker in 1997, Meo managed a wristwatch and jewellery store in Hatton Garden.

<text>Robotic mapping is a discipline related to computer vision and cartography. The goal for an autonomous robot is to be able to construct (or use) a map (outdoor use) or floor plan (indoor use) and to localize itself and its recharging bases or beacons in it. Robotic mapping is that branch which deals with the study and application of ability to localize itself in a map / plan and sometimes to 
construct the map or floor plan by the autonomous robot.
Evolutionarily shaped blind action may suffice to keep some animals alive. For some insects for example, the environment is not interpreted as a map, and they survive only with a triggered response. A slightly more elaborated navigation strategy dramatically enhances the capabilities of the robot. Cognitive maps enable planning capacities and use of current perceptions, memorized events, and expected consequences.

== Operation ==
The robot has two sources of information: the idiothetic and the allothetic sources. When in motion, a robot can use dead reckoning methods such as tracking the number of revolutions of its wheels; this corresponds to the idiothetic source and can give the absolute position of the robot, but it is subject to cumulative error which can grow quickly.

The allothetic source corresponds the sensors of the robot, like a camera, a microphone, laser, lidar or sonar. The problem here is &quot;perceptual aliasing&quot;. This means that two different places can be perceived as the same. For example, in a building, it is nearly impossible to determine a location solely with the visual information, because all the corridors may look the same. 3-dimensional models of a robot&#x27;s environment can be generated using range imaging sensors or 3D scanners.

== Map representation ==
The internal representation of the map can be &quot;metric&quot; or &quot;topological&quot;: 
*The metric framework is the most common for humans and considers a two-dimensional space in which it places the objects. The objects are placed with precise coordinates. This representation is very useful, but is sensitive to noise and it is difficult to calculate the distances precisely.
*The topological framework only considers places and relations between them. Often, the distances between places are stored. The map is then a graph, in which the nodes corresponds to places and arcs correspond to the paths.

Many techniques use probabilistic representations of the map, in order to handle uncertainty.

There are three main methods of map representations, i.e., free space maps, object maps, and composite maps. These employ the notion of a grid, but permit the resolution of the grid to vary so that it can become finer where more accuracy is needed and more coarse where the map is uniform.

== Map learning ==
Map learning cannot be separated from the localization process, and a difficulty arises when errors in localization are incorporated into the map. This problem is commonly referred to as Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

An important additional problem is to determine whether the robot is in a part of environment already stored or never visited. One way to solve this problem is by using electric beacons, Near field communication (NFC), WiFi, Visible light communication (VLC) and Li-Fi and Bluetooth.

== Path planning ==
Path planning is an important issue as it allows a robot to get from point A to point B. Path planning algorithms are measured by their computational complexity. The feasibility of real-time motion planning is dependent on the accuracy of the map (or floorplan), on robot localization and on the number of obstacles. Topologically, the problem of path planning is related to the shortest path problem of finding a route between two nodes in a graph.

== Robot navigation ==

Outdoor robots can use GPS in a similar way to automotive navigation systems.

Alternative systems can be used with floor plan and beacons instead of maps for indoor robots, combined with localization wireless hardware. Electric beacons can help for cheap robot navigational systems.

<doc id="623113" wikidata="Q5210793" url="?curid=623113" title="Dales Way">
<text>The Dales Way is an long-distance footpath in Northern England, from (south-east to north-west) Ilkley, West Yorkshire, to Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria. This walk was initially devised by the West Riding Ramblers&#x27; Association with the &#x27;leading lights&#x27; being Colin Speakman and Tom Wilcock (Footpath Secretary). The route was announced to the public in 1968 and the first recorded crossing was by a group of Bradford Grammar School Venture Scouts in 1969.

The Dales Way passes through two National Parks: the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the Lake District National Park. The first half of the walk follows the River Wharfe upstream to the main watershed of Northern England at Ribblehead. The second half follows several river valleys (Dentdale, River Mint, River Kent) to descend to the shores of Windermere.

==Route==
The walk is shorter and less strenuous than better-known routes such as the Pennine Way and Coast to Coast Walk, being mostly along river valleys. It thus makes a good training ground for these harder walks while being well worth doing in its own right. It is feasible (for those more interested in a challenge than the enjoyment of the walk) to complete the route in around four days, but most walkers take about a week, dividing the route into sections of 10 to 15 miles per day and taking a rest day or two. 

From Ilkley the trail closely follows the River Wharfe past Addingham, Bolton Abbey and Burnsall to Grassington. It then follows a higher level route before returning to the riverside from Kettlewell to Buckden. From there the Dales Way follows the upper reaches of the river through Langstrothdale, passing the small hamlets of Hubberholme and Yockenthwaite to Beckermonds, where the confluence of two becks forms the Wharfe. The trail ascends the valley of Oughtershaw Beck by a minor road to the hamlet of Oughtershaw.

From Oughtershaw the Dales Way ascends steeply to the watershed at Cam Fell above Cam Houses. The Dales Way descends from Cam Fell by a good track to Gearstones on the B6255 road, east of Ribblehead, where there is a pub and a railway station. From Cam Fell a shorter alternative route, with no facilities, follows the Pennine Bridleway to rejoin the Dales Way at Stoops Moss, north of Gearstones. 

From Stoops Moss the trail descends steeply into Dentdale by a minor road, which it follows for . An alternative high level route follows the Pennine Bridleway before descending past Dent railway station into Dentdale at Cowgill. The Dales Way passes through the village of Dent and then crosses a fell to reach the banks of the River Rawthey at Millthrop, just outside the town of Sedbergh.

From Sedbergh the trail follows the River Rawthey downstream, then follows the River Lune upstream through the Lune Gorge. The Dales Way eventually crosses the river by the historic Crook of Lune Bridge (the border of the former West Riding of Yorkshire), and shortly after finally leaves the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The trail then follows field paths west. It crosses the M6 motorway and descends the valley of the River Mint. It continues west to cross the A6 road north of Kendal, and reaches the large village of Burneside on the River Kent. The Dales Way follows the River Kent north to Staveley. In its final section the trail crosses higher ground with views of the Lake District mountains to end at a dramatic viewpoint just above Bowness.

== Logistics ==
Planning an itinerary is generally easy. Public transport (including Windermere &quot;steamers&quot;) is good at both ends of the route (railway stations at Ilkley and Windermere). The popularity of the walk (and the area generally) means that there are many choices of accommodation – for instance, many pubs along the route offer bed and breakfast.

Many walkers walk the Dales Way in sections, using public transport. Between Ilkley and Sedbergh the Dalesbus network serves the route at many points, and the Settle–Carlisle railway also assists the sectional walker. At the northern end of the route there are frequent trains on the Windermere branch line, and Stagecoach buses between Kendal, Windermere and Bowness.
The largest settlements on the route are Ilkley and Bowness at either end. Grassington and Sedbergh have a range of facilities, and provisions are also available at Kettlewell, Dent, Burneside and Staveley. The larger town of Kendal is not far from the route.
===Warnings===
The most difficult section is over the watershed from Buckden to Gearstones. This section has the greatest ascent and descent, and passes through remote country with limited accommodation and no other facilities. The distance from Buckden to the next public transport at Ribblehead is , and it is from Buckden to the first accommodation in Dentdale, near Cowgill. 

For much of its length the Dales Way follows riverside paths in upland areas. Paths may become flooded and impassable and alternative routes may need to be followed. The Dales Way Association maintains up-to-date information on flooding and other hazards on its website and publishes suggested route alternatives.

==Connecting trails==

From its initial conception the Dales Way was planned with link routes to Ilkley from three urban centres in the West Riding of Yorkshire: Leeds, Bradford and Harrogate. The Leeds Link runs for from Woodhouse Moor along the Meanwood Valley Trail and over Otley Chevin and Ilkley Moor to Ilkley. The Bradford Link is long from Bradford Cathedral via Shipley Glen and Ilkley Moor to Ilkley. The Harrogate Link is long, running from the Valley Gardens in Harrogate by Haverah Park and the Washburn Valley to Ilkley.

At Ilkley the Dales Way connects with the Ebor Way. On its course through Wharfedale, Lady Anne&#x27;s Way runs in conjunction with the Dales Way. At Cam Fell between Langstrothdale and Ribblehead the Dales Way briefly coincides with the Pennine Way and the Pennine Bridleway. At Ribblehead the trail connects with the Ribble Way. Just before it reaches the end at Bowness-on-Windermere the route connects with the Windermere Way. 

The Dales High Way is a high level route which runs parallel to the Dales Way between Ilkley Moor and Dent and on to Sedbergh.

<doc id="623117" wikidata="Q179335" url="?curid=623117" title="2003 San Marino Grand Prix">
<text>The 2003 San Marino Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Foster&#x27;s di San Marino 2003) was a Formula One motor race held on 20 April 2003 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, Imola, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, with the race taking place on Easter Sunday. It was the fourth round of the 2003 Formula One season The 62-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher for the Ferrari team after starting from pole position. Kimi Räikkönen, driving for McLaren, finished second with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. The remaining points-scoring positions were filled by Ralf Schumacher (Williams), David Coulthard (McLaren), Fernando Alonso (Renault), Juan Pablo Montoya (Williams) and Jenson Button (BAR). Schumacher&#x27;s victory for Ferrari was his and the team&#x27;s first of the season.

Schumacher and his brother Ralf raced despite the death of their mother Elisabeth before the Grand Prix. The brothers led the field at the start with Ralf leading having overtaken Michael and held the lead until the first round of pit stops.

As a consequence of the race, Räikkönen increased his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, over teammate David Coulthard to 13 points with Michael Schumacher climbing to third. In the World Constructors Championship, McLaren increased their lead to 19 points with Ferrari overtaking Renault for second.

==Background==
Heading into the fourth race of the season, McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen was leading the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 24 points, teammate David Coulthard was second on 15 points, 9 points behind Räikkönen. Behind Räikkönen and Coulthard in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Fernando Alonso was third on 14 points in a Renault, with Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli on 10 and 9 points respectively. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren were leading on 39 points and Renault were second on 23 points, with Ferrari on 16 points.

At the preceding Brazilian Grand Prix, confusion caused by a red flag at the end of the race led to Räikkönen being declared the winner. An investigation by Formula One&#x27;s governing body the FIA in the days following the race proved that Fisichella had been the actual victor. The investigation discovered that Fisichella started his 56th lap when the red flag was shown and the results were rolled back to 54 laps. Under the countback rule, the driver leading two laps before a race is stopped is declared the winner. During a meeting organised by the teams, the countback rule would be placed under review having highlighted potential problems. Fifteen minutes before the start of the first practice session, a ceremony was held in which Räikkönen and McLaren team principal Ron Dennis presented their winners&#x27; trophies to Fisichella and Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan, accompanied by the Italian national anthem (in honour to Fisichella) and by the Irish national anthem (in honour to Jordan).

Ferrari originally planned to debut its new car the F2003-GA at Imola. However, issues with reliability led to the decision to race the F2002. Ferrari stated the F2002 was still a competitive car and believed racing the F2003-GA would be &quot;risky&quot; despite testing the car at Mugello and Fiorano.

== Friday drivers ==
Three teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship had the right to run a third car on Friday&#x27;s additional testing. These drivers did not compete in qualifying or the race.

==Practice==
Three practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held from 11:00 to 12:00 local time on Friday, and two 45 minute timed sessions were also held on Saturday from 09:00 to 09:45 and 10:15 to 11:00 local time. The Qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon. The cars were run one at a time; the Friday running order was determined with the Championship leading heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.

Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya set the pace in the Friday free practice, which took place in dry and sunny conditions, with a time of 1:21.335. Montoya was less than sixth hundredths of a second behind, ahead of Jaguar driver Mark Webber, Coulthard, Alonso and BAR driver Jenson Button. Michael Schumacher clipped the kerb at the Variante Bassa chicane, damaging the Ferrari&#x27;s left rear suspension.

==Qualifying==
In the Saturday afternoon qualifying session, Schumacher clinched his second pole position of the season with a time of 1:22.327. He was joined on the front row by his brother Ralf Schumacher, who was 14 thousands of a seconds behind. Rubens Barrichello was third in the other Ferrari, with Montoya fourth. Webber took fifth, with Räikkönen taking sixth. Minardi driver Jos Verstappen crashed into the wall at the Variane Alta chicane becoming the first driver to not set a competitive lap time under the new qualifying format.

==Race==
The race took place in the afternoon and started at 14:00 local time, in dry and clear weather. As usual, the race was broadcast worldwide, with the &quot;World Feed&quot; coverage being produced by host broadcaster RAI. Michael Schumacher, from pole position on the grid, lost the lead from Ralf Schumacher before the first corner. Webber, from fifth, made a poor start dropping down to eleventh. Räikkonen managed to gain one position for fifth with teammate Coulthard making the best start and gained four places to go into eighth position. Webber&#x27;s teammate Antônio Pizzonia stalled on the grid. Trackside marshals pushed Pizzonia&#x27;s car to the exit of the pitlane where Jaguar mechanics managed to restart the car&#x27;s engine enabling Pizzonia rejoin at the back of the field.

===Post-race===
Ralf and Michael Schumacher raced despite the death of their mother Elisabeth just hours before the race with the pair flying on a private jet to Cologne to be at her side. They sported black armbands and no champagne was sprayed on the podium as a mark of respect. Ralf also sported a black stripe on his racing helmet. The Schumacher brothers left the circuit immediately after the podium celebrations and Ferrari team principal Jean Todt took Michael&#x27;s place at the post-race press conference. Race stewards Tony Scott-Andrews, Roger Peart and Giuseppe Musiconi formally excused the Schumacher brothers from the pre and post-race formalities.

At the subsequent post-race press conference, Todt revealed that Schumacher made the decision to compete in the Grand Prix with Ferrari giving their full support to Schumacher. Mercedes motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug expressed sympathy for the Schumacher brothers while also praising them for their performance during the race.

As a consequence of the race, Räikkönen increased his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, over teammate David Coulthard to 13 points with Schumacher climbing to third. In the World Constructors Championship, McLaren increased their lead to 16 points with Ferrari overtaking Renault for second.

<doc id="623118" wikidata="Q161173" url="?curid=623118" title="Ipomoea">
<text>Ipomoea () is the largest genus in the plant family Convolvulaceae, with over 600 species. It is a large and diverse group, with common names including morning glory, water convolvulus or water spinach, sweet potato, bindweed, moonflower, etc. The genus occurs throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and comprises annual and perennial herbaceous plants, lianas, shrubs, and small trees; most of the species are twining climbing plants.

Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in &quot;Calonyction&quot; (Greek &quot;good&quot; and , , , &quot;night&quot;) are called moonflowers. The name &quot;Ipomoea&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek , meaning , and (), meaning &quot;resembling&quot;. It refers to their twining habit.

== Uses and ecology ==
Human uses of &quot;Ipomoea&quot; include: 
*Most species have spectacular, colorful flowers, and are often grown as ornamentals, and a number of cultivars have been developed. Their deep flowers attract large Lepidoptera - especially the Sphingidae, such as the pink-spotted hawk moth (&quot;Agrius cingulata&quot;) - or even hummingbirds.
*The genus includes food crops; the tubers of sweet potatoes (&quot;I. batatas)&quot; and the leaves of water spinach (&quot;I. aquatica&quot;) are commercially important food items, and have been for millennia. The sweet potato is one of the Polynesian &quot;canoe plants&quot;, transplanted by settlers on islands throughout the Pacific. Water spinach is used all over eastern Asia and the warmer regions of the Americas as a key component of well-known dishes, such as &quot;canh chua rau muống&quot; (Mekong sour soup) or callaloo; its numerous local names attest to its popularity. Other species are used on a smaller scale, e.g. the whitestar potato (&quot;I. lacunosa&quot;) traditionally eaten by some Native Americans, such as the Chiricahua Apaches, or the Australian bush potato (&quot;I. costata&quot;). The peduncles or seed pods of Ipomoea muricata are consumed as a delicacy in the Indian state of Kerala.
*Peonidin, an anthocyanidin potentially useful as a food additive, is present in significant quantities in the flowers of the &#x27;Heavenly Blue&#x27; morning glory cultivar.
*Ipomoea sepiaria, is part of the Dashapushpam (Ten sacred flowers) in Kerala and is known as &quot;Thiruthali&quot; in Malayalam.
*Moon vine (&quot;I. alba&quot;) sap was used for vulcanization of the latex of &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; (Panama rubber tree, Nahuatl: &quot;olicuáhuitl&quot;) to rubber; as it happens, the rubber tree seems well-suited for the vine to twine upon, and the two species are often found together. As early as 1600 BCE, the Olmecs produced the balls used in the Mesoamerican ballgame.
*The root called John the Conqueror in hoodoo and used in lucky and/or sexual charms (though apparently not as a component of love potions, because it is a strong laxative if ingested) usually seems to be from &quot;I. jalapa&quot;. The testicle-like dried tubers are carried as amulets and rubbed by the users to gain good luck in gambling or flirting. As Willie Dixon wrote, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, in his song &quot;Rub My Root&quot; (a Muddy Waters version is titled &quot;My John the Conquer Root&quot;):

:My pistol may snap, my mojo is frail
:But I rub my root, my luck will never fail
:When I rub my root, my John the Conquer root
:Aww, you know there ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; she can do, Lord,
:I rub my John the Conquer root

=== As medicine and entheogen ===

Humans use &quot;Ipomoea&quot; spp. for their content of medical and psychoactive compounds, mainly alkaloids. Some species are renowned for their properties in folk medicine and herbalism; for example, Vera Cruz jalap (&quot;I. jalapa&quot;) and Tampico jalap (&quot;I. simulans&quot;) are used to produce jalap, a cathartic preparation accelerating the passage of stool. &quot;Kiribadu ala&quot; (giant potato, &quot;I. mauritiana&quot;) is one of the many ingredients of &quot;chyawanprash&quot;, the ancient Ayurvedic tonic called &quot;the elixir of life&quot; for its wide-ranging properties.

The leaves of &quot;I. batatas&quot; are eaten as a vegetable, and have been shown to slow oxygenation of LDLs, with some similar potential health benefits to green tea and grape polyphenols.

Other species were and still are used as potent entheogens. Seeds of Mexican morning glory (&quot;tlitliltzin, I. tricolor&quot;) were thus used by Aztecs and Zapotecs in shamanistic and priestly divination rituals, and at least by the former also as a poison, to give the victim a &quot;horror trip&quot; (see also Aztec entheogenic complex). Beach moonflower (&quot;I. violacea&quot;) was also used thusly, and the cultivars called &#x27;Heavenly Blue&#x27;, touted today for their psychoactive properties, seem to represent an indeterminable assembly of hybrids of these two species.Ergoline derivatives (lysergamides) are probably responsible for the entheogenic activity. Ergine (LSA), isoergine, -lysergic acid N-(α-hydroxyethyl)amide and lysergol have been isolated from &quot;I. tricolor&quot;, &quot;I. violacea&quot; and/or purple morning glory (&quot;I. purpurea&quot;); although these are often assumed to be the cause of the plants&#x27; effects, this is not supported by scientific studies, which show although they are psychoactive, they are not notably hallucinogenic. Alexander Shulgin in &quot;TiHKAL&quot; suggests ergonovine is responsible, instead. It has verified psychoactive properties, though as yet other undiscovered lysergamides possibly are present in the seeds.

Though most often noted as &quot;recreational&quot; drugs, the lysergamides are also of medical importance. Ergonovine enhances the action of oxytocin, used to still &quot;post partum&quot; bleeding. Ergine induces drowsiness and a relaxed state, so might be useful in treating anxiety disorder. Whether &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species are useful sources of these compounds remains to be determined. In any case, in some jurisdictions, certain &quot;Ipomoea&quot; are regulated, e.g. by the Louisiana State Act 159, which bans cultivation of &quot;I. violacea&quot; except for ornamental purposes.
=== Pests and diseases ===
Many herbivores avoid morning glories such as &quot;Ipomoea&quot;, as the high alkaloid content makes these plants unpalatable, if not toxic. Nonetheless, &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). For a selection of diseases of the sweet potato (&quot;I. batatas&quot;), many of which also infect other members of this genus, see List of sweet potato diseases.

=== Pollination ===
The species of &quot;Ipomoea&quot; interfere with each other&#x27;s pollination. Pollen from different species compete in each other&#x27;s reproductive processes, imposing a fitness cost.

<doc id="623130" wikidata="Q182561" url="?curid=623130" title="Coromandel Coast">
<text>The Coromandel Coast is the southeastern coastal region of the Indian subcontinent, bounded by the Utkal Plains to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Kaveri delta to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west, extending over an area of about 22,800 square kilometres. The coast has an average elevation of 80 metres and is backed by the Eastern Ghats, a chain of low lying and flat-topped hills.

The land of the Chola dynasty was called Cholamandalam in Tamil, literally translated as &quot;the realm of the Cholas&quot;, from which Coromandel is derived.

In historical Muslim sources from the 12th century onward, the Coromandel Coast was called Maʿbar.

==Etymology==
The land of the Chola dynasty was called &quot;Cholamandalam&quot; (சோழ மண்டலம்) in Tamil, translated as &quot;The realm of the Cholas&quot;, from which the Portuguese derived the name &quot;Coromandel&quot;. The name could also be derived from &quot;Karai mandalam&quot;, meaning &quot;The realm of the Shores&quot;.

Another theory is that the first Dutch ship to India stopped at Karimanal, an island village to the north of Pulicat. The sailors aboard the ship mispronounced the village&#x27;s name as &#x27;Corimondal&#x27; and the name stuck thereafter.

An Italian explorer, Ludovico di Varthema, perhaps first gave the name Coromandel in 1510, which was then used on maps by the Portuguese, but it was the Dutch who took up serious trading there.

===Flora===
The Coromandel Coast is home to the East Deccan dry evergreen forests ecoregion, which runs in a narrow strip along the coast. Unlike most of the other tropical dry forest Biome regions of India, where the trees lose their leaves during the dry season, the East Deccan dry evergreen forests retain their leathery leaves year round.

The Coromandel Coast is also home to extensive mangrove forests along the low-lying coast and river deltas, and several important wetlands, notably Kaliveli Lake and Pulicat Lake, that provide habitat to thousands of migrating and resident birds.

==History==

By late 1530 the Coromandel Coast was home to three Portuguese settlements at Nagapattinam, São Tomé de Meliapore, and Pulicat . In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Coromandel Coast was the scene of rivalries among European powers for control of the India trade. The British established themselves at Fort St George (Madras) and Masulipatnam, the Dutch at Pulicat, Sadras and Covelong, the French at Pondicherry, Karaikal and Nizampatnam, the Danish in Dansborg at Tharangambadi.

The Coromandel Coast supplied Indian Muslim eunuchs to the Thai palace and court of Siam (modern Thailand). The Thai at times asked eunuchs from China to visit the court in Thailand and advise them on court ritual since they held them in high regard.

Eventually the British won out, although France retained the tiny enclaves of Pondichéry and Karaikal until 1954. Chinese lacquer goods, including boxes, screens, and chests, became known as &quot;Coromandel&quot; goods in the 18th century, because many Chinese exports were consolidated at the Coromandel ports.

Two of the famous books on the economic history of the Coromandel Coast are &quot;Merchants, companies, and commerce on the Coromandel Coast, 1650–1740&quot; (Arasaratnam, Oxford University Press, 1986) and &quot;The World of the Weaver in Northern Coromandel, &quot; (P. Swarnalatha, Orient Longman, 2005).

On 26 December 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history, the Indian Ocean earthquake, struck off the western coast of Sumatra (Indonesia). The earthquake and subsequent tsunami reportedly killed over 220,000 people around the rim of the Indian Ocean. The tsunami devastated the Coromandel Coast, killing many and sweeping away many coastal communities.

==Applications of the name==
Four ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name after the Indian coast. The Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand was named after one of these ships, and the town of Coromandel, New Zealand was named after the peninsula.
Coromandel Valley, South Australia, and its neighbouring suburb, Coromandel East, gained their names from the ship &quot;Coromandel&quot;, which arrived in Holdfast Bay from London in 1837 with 156 English settlers. After the ship reached the shore, some of its sailors deserted, intending to remain behind in South Australia, and took refuge in the hills in the Coromandel Valley region.

In Slovene, the idiom &quot;Indija Koromandija&quot; (India Coromandel) means a land of plenty, a promised land, a utopia where &quot;Houses are bleached with cheese and covered with cake&quot;.

Edward Lear situates his nonsense poem &quot;The Yonghy Bonghy Bo&quot; by citing Coromandel on the first line: &quot;On the Coast of Coromandel&quot;.

The Coromandel Express is a train of the Indian Railways. The daily train runs down the east coast of India between Shalimar railway station, West Bengal, and Chennai Central railway station, Tamil Nadu.

<doc id="623133" wikidata="Q3304214" url="?curid=623133" title="E Bukura e Dheut">
<text>E Bukura e Dheut (the &quot;Beauty of the Earth&quot; or &quot;Earthly Beauty&quot;) is an epithet in Albanian mythology and folklore, used in some traditions for a crafty fairy, and in other traditions for a chthonic/earth goddess, the counterpart of e Bukura e Detit (the Beauty of the Sea) and i Bukuri i Qiellit (the Beauty of the Sky). As a goddess of the underworld and at the same time a personification of springtime, the Beauty of the Earth is evidently an epithet of the Albanian equivalent of the Ancient Greek Persephone, which is considered to be Prende, the Albanian dawn goddess, goddess of love, beauty, fertility, health, and protector of women, also referred to as &quot;Zoja e Bukuris&quot; &quot;Goddess/Lady of Beauty&quot;.

In central Albanian folklore E Bukura e Dheut appears as the sister of e Bukura e Detit and the consort of Baba Tomor.

The quest for the &quot;e Bukura e Dheut&quot; is a very popular and frequent motif in Albanian folktales: the princely hero must search for or rescue the Earthly Beauty, even going into her mystical underworld palace.

==Role==

E Bukura e Dheut is beauty itself, golden-haired, but may also appear in the form of an &quot;arap&quot; with black skin. She may be a good spirit or (more often) evil, with magical powers the derive from her dress, and lives in the underworld, where her palace is guarded by a three-headed dog, a kuçedra and all sorts of other weird and wonderful creatures. She is sometimes described as always ready to help, and so powerful that she can undertake tasks that would normally be the province of God or of an angel.

In some traditions e Bukura e Dheut is a chthonic goddess of the underworld or earth goddess, The ancestors of the Albanians presumably had in common with the Ancient Greek theogony the tripartite division of the administration of the world into heaven, sea, and underworld, and in the same functions as the Greek deities Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, they would have worshiped the deities referred to as the Beauty of the Sky (&quot;i Bukuri i Qiellit&quot;), the Beauty of the Sea (&quot;e Bukura e Detit&quot;), and the Beauty of the Earth (&quot;e Bukura e Dheut&quot;). The phrases &quot;the Beauty of the Sea&quot; and &quot;the Beauty of the Earth&quot; are kept to refer to figures of Albanian folk beliefs and fairy tales, &quot;the Beauty of the Sky&quot; continues to be used in Albanian to refer to the monotheistic God. In central Albanian folklore, e Bukura e Dheut is the wife of Baba Tomor.

==Appearances in folktales==
Albanologist Robert Elsie and Janice Mathie-Heck stated that the character is very popular in Albanian myths and fairy tales. The quest for the &quot;e Bukura e Dheut&quot; is a very popular and frequent motif in Albanian folktales: the princely hero must search for or rescue the Earthly Beauty, even going into her mystical underworld palace.

English traveller Lucy Mary Jane Garnett noted the character is present in Albanian and Greek folktales as &quot;Beauty of the Earth&quot; or &quot;[Beauty of] the World&quot;.

===In Albania===
Her name is given as &quot;Beautiful of the Earth&quot; by Martin Camaj and she is present as a character in &quot;Albanian Wonder Tales&quot;, by George Post Wheeler: &quot;The Boy who killed the Dîf&quot;, &quot;The Boy who took the Letter to the World where the Dead live&quot;, &quot;The Boy who was fated to be a King&quot; and &quot;The Boy who was Brother to the Drague&quot;. This last tale is an English translation of the epic &quot;The Twins&quot;, the story of brothers Zjermi and Handa.

Her name is translated as &quot;Belle of the Earth&quot; in another variant of tale type ATU 707, identified as the &quot;Albanian version&quot; of the story, collected in Auguste Dozon&#x27;s &quot;Contes Albanais&quot; (Paris, 1881) and published in &quot;Variants and analogues of the tales in Vol. III of Sir R. F. Burton&#x27;s Supplemental Arabian Nights (1887)&quot;, by W. A. Clouston. Dozon himself had collected three tales with the character, named &quot;La Belle de la Terre&quot;: Tale II - &quot;Les Soeurs Jaleuses&quot; (&quot;The Envious Sisters&quot;), Tale V - &quot;La Belle de la Terre&quot; (&quot;The Beauty of the World&quot;) and Tale XII - &quot;La Loubie et la Belle de la Terre&quot;.

Parisian professor André Mazon published a study on Balkan folklore, with four tales of The Beauty of the Earth, whose name he wrote down as &quot;lepinata zemiâtuj&quot; or &quot;lepinata zemjëtuj&quot;: &quot;La Chevrette Merveilleuse&quot;, &quot;Belle de la Terre&quot;, &quot;Les Trois Soeurs&quot; and &quot;Le Fils de L&#x27;Ourse&quot;.

French comparativist Emmanuel Cosquin, in his folklore analysis, cited her as &quot;La Belle de la Terre&quot; (the French translation of her name), in a tale collected by Holger Pedersen: a youth, son of a hunter, touches four pieces of flesh hanging from a tree; they reform into the Beauty of Earth, who explains she has been a captive of a &quot;dark elf&quot; for 10 years. Cosquin also quoted the tale where the Beauty of the Earth disguises herself in her &quot;dark skin&quot; and assumes another identity. The motif of the magical dress or garment also happens in a story where her suitor brings home to his mother the magical dress.

German albanologist Robert Elsie translated her name as &quot;Earthly Beauty&quot;, in his book &quot;Albanian Folktales and Legends&quot;, and she appears in six tales of his compilation: &quot;The Youth and the Maiden with Stars on their Foreheads and Crescents on their Breasts&quot;, &quot;The three friends and the Earthly Beauty&quot;, &quot;The Boy and the Earthly Beauty&quot;, &quot;The Scurfhead&quot; (as a trio of Earthly Beauties living in an underground kingdom), &quot;The Stirrup Moor&quot; (as the true identity of the Moor and helper of the hero) and &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter and the Skull&quot; (as a fairy who disenchants the skull).

This character&#x27;s name is translated as &quot;Schöne der Erde&quot; in German translations by linguist August Leskien, in his book of Balkan folktales: &quot;&quot;Die Lubi und die Schöne der Erde&quot;, &quot;Die Schöne der Erde&quot;, &quot;Die neidischen Schwestern&quot; (a variant of the ATU 707 tale type), and in &quot;Die Nachtigall Gisar&quot;&quot; (where she appears as the owner of the nightingale Gisar). She also appears in &quot;Das Haar der Schönen der Erde&quot; (&quot;The Hair of the Beauty of the Earth&quot;), in von Hahn&#x27;s book of Albanian fairy tales, and in &quot;Die drei Gesellen&quot;, from author Gustav Meyer. Lucy Mary Jane Garnett translated Leskien&#x27;s Albanian tale as &quot;The Liouvía and the Beauty of The Earth&quot;.

The Beauty of the Earth also appears in the tale &quot;Peshkatari dhe e Bukura e dheut&quot; (&quot;The Fisherman and the Beauty of the World&quot;), collected by Anton Çetta in his &quot;Përralla&quot;, Vol II, and in the compilation by Donat Kurti, in the story of &quot;The Beauty of the Earth and the Shtriga&quot; (&quot;e Bukura e dheut dhe shtriga&quot;).

Folklorist Anton Berisha published another Albanian language tale with the character, titled &quot;Djali i vogël i padishajt dhe e bukura e dheut që bahesh skile&quot;.

===In Greece===
This mythological figure has been found in the Arvanitika dialect of Albanian, in Greece, with the name written in Greek derived script: &quot;Ε μπούκουρα ε δέουτ&quot;.

A character named &quot;Beauty of the Land&quot; appears in a fairy tale variant of the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index 707, &quot;The Three Golden Children&quot; (&quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird&quot;), collected in the village of Zagori, Epirus, by J. G. Von Hahn in his &quot;Griechische und Albanische Märchen&quot; (Leipzig, 1864), and analysed by Arthur Bernard Cook in his &quot;Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion&quot;.

In the tale &quot;The Twin Brothers&quot; (tale type ATU 303, &quot;The Twins or Blood Brothers&quot;), published (as unsourced) by Andrew Lang in his &quot;The Grey Fairy Book&quot; and compiled by scholar Georgios A. Megas in his book &quot;Folktales of Greece&quot;, an old woman reveals that the infertility of a fisherman&#x27;s wife can be cured by ingesting the flesh of a gold-fish, and after some should be given to her she-dogs and mares. Male twins are born, two foals and two puppies - each brother getting a hound and a horse. A pair of cypress trees also sprout in the fisherman&#x27;s garden and act as their life token. When one of the twins leaves home, he arrives at a kingdom and tries to woo the princess of this kingdom, by performing three tasks for her father. The princess&#x27;s name is given as &quot;Fairest in the Land&quot; in Lang&#x27;s translation, and as &quot;Beauty of the Country&quot; in Megas&#x27;s version. This tale was originally collected in German by Austrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn from Negades, Zagori. with the title &quot;Die Zwillingsbrüder&quot;. In Hahn&#x27;s version, the princess is named &quot;Schönen des Landes&quot;.

In another tale collected by Georgios A. Megas, &quot;The Navel of the Earth&quot;, a dying king makes his sons promise to wed his three sisters to whoever passes by their castle after his death. The youngest marries his sisters off, respectively, to a lame man, a one-eyed man and a man in rags. Later, he decides to win the &quot;Beauty of the World&quot; as his bride, despite her dangerous reputation.

===In Italy===
In the heroic tale &quot;The Twins&quot; (Albanian: &quot;Binoshët&quot;; Italian: &quot;I Gemelli&quot;) collected by Giuseppe Schirò in Piana degli Albanesi and published in his 1923 &quot;Canti tradizionali ed altri saggi delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia&quot;, e Bukura e Dheut is translated in Italian as &quot;la Bella della Terra&quot;.

According to Albanologist Robert Elsie, Bernardo Bilotta, an Italian poet and writer of Arbëresh descent, has composed unpublished narrative poems with fairy tale motifs, based on the legend of &quot;The Beauty of the Earth&quot;: &quot;E bukura e Jetës&quot; (La Bella del Mondo) (1894) and &quot;La Bella Gioia&quot; (1896).

<text>RTÉ 2fm, or 2FM as it is more commonly referred to, is an Irish radio station operated by RTÉ. The station specialises in current popular music and chart hits and is the second national radio station in Ireland.

==History==
The station commenced broadcasting on 31 May 1979 and has undergone numerous name and line-up changes.

In 2008, the station had 17% of the national audience, making it the second most popular station in Ireland after RTÉ Radio 1 (23%). According to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, the 9amnoon slot is &quot;the most critical in the 2fm schedule both in terms of audience figures and advertising revenue&quot;. This was presented by Gerry Ryan from 1988 until his sudden death on 30 April 2010. &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot; was the longest running show in the station&#x27;s history.

The station is recognised as being the first in the world to play any new single released by U2, due to the band&#x27;s long-term friendship with Dave Fanning. They celebrated their thirty-year association with each other in September 2009 with the airing of a special weekend of programmes, including &quot;U2&#x27;s Top 30 Moments&quot;.

RTÉ 2fm, like RTÉ Radio 1, technically broadcasts 24 hours a day, however it plays a computerised music feed weekdays from midnight - 6am and weekends from 5- 7am (originally replays of previous day&#x27;s selected programmes) along with live news updates on the hour, and weekend overnight hours have been home to specialist music recorded shows since 2001. The station regularly broadcasts live from large Irish music festivals, such as Oxegen, Electric Picnic and Life Festival, and latterly has broadcast live music under the title &quot;2fm XtrAlive&quot; (formerly &quot;2fm Live&quot;), with the most recorded visiting act being Manic Street Preachers. The series of shows entitled the 2fm 2moro 2our maintained the station&#x27;s reputation for homegrown live performance promotion as well as offering career boosts to artists such as The Immediate, The Flaws, Ham Sandwich, Concerto For Constantine and David Geraghty.

As part of the expansion of RTÉ&#x27;s young people&#x27;s music radio output, an all-music (mostly of the rock genre) sister station of 2FM, RTÉ 2XM, designed for students and young adults, now operates on the RTÉ DAB Multiplex.

==Reception==
RTÉ 2fm is available in Ireland on 90-92 MHz FM, and on 97 MHz in the northeast.
The station was previously available on 612 kHz medium wave until 12 April 2004 from the Athlone transmitter. It was also available on 1278 kHz on low power transmissions from Dublin (until December 2003) and from Cork (until 12 April 2004).

===Radio 2 (19791988)===
RTÉ Radio 2, as it was originally known, began broadcasting on 31 May 1979. &quot;Like Clockwork&quot; by The Boomtown Rats was the first song on air, played by Larry Gogan. It was developed as a response by RTÉ to the pirate radio craze sweeping Dublin and the rest of the country. Its original slogan was &quot;Radio 2 Comin&#x27;atcha&quot; and, as well as broadcasting popular music, it carried a number of other musical strands as well as news and current affairs. Its main inspiration in format was BBC Radio 1. Its original broadcast frequencies were 612 kHz (Athlone/nationwide) and 1278 kHz (Dublin and Cork) MW (until 2004) and 90-92 MHz FM. As well as Larry Gogan, other original DJs included Vincent Hanley and Jimmy Greeley, who transferred from RTÉ Radio 1, and Mark Cagney, who transferred from RTÉ Cork Local Radio. Most of the remaining DJs were recruited directly from the pirate stations, such as Michael McNamara, Declan Meehan, Ronan Collins, Gerry Ryan and Dave Fanning.

===2FM (19881999)===

In 1988 after many years presenting a nightly music show called &quot;Lights out&quot; for around 6 years previously &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot;, a morning topical radio show, began broadcasts. Not long afterwards, RTÉ began radical changes to Radio 2&#x27;s format. Most non-pop music programming was dropped. The station was rebranded as &quot;2FM&quot; in 1988. At this stage the basic schedule for the next decade or so was put in place: Ian Dempsey, Gerry Ryan, Larry Gogan, Gareth O&#x27;Callaghan, Tony Fenton, Dusty Rhodes, DJ Micky Mac (Michael McNamara), Barry Lang, John Kenny and Dave Fanning were staples of this period. Many of these presenters have stayed with 2FM over the years while others have moved to competing stations. In 1998, after 18 years with the station, drivetime presenter Barry Lang left to become an airline pilot, in the Middle East.

2FM in this era was at its most popular. Its mobile broadcasting unit, the roadcaster, made regular trips nationwide, with 2FM organising live events throughout Ireland, such as the &quot;Beat on the Street&quot; with M.C and &#x27;Eye in the Sky&#x27; traffic news presenter Electric Eddie, Doug Murray, introducing the station&#x27;s DJs to the vast crowds which gathered at events throughout Ireland and &quot;Lark in the Park&quot;. New bands would often get their &quot;big break&quot; by being featured on the &quot;Dave Fanning Show&quot;. Gerry Ryan&#x27;s radio show became a national institution.

===RTÉ 2fm (20002009)===

By the year 2000, the 1990s schedule was looking very stale. In addition, 2FM suffered the high-profile departure of Ian Dempsey to the newly established commercial national radio station Today FM. Both Today FM and the emerging independent local radio sector had eroded 2FM&#x27;s once unassailable listenership base. Tony Fenton was the most recent departure to Today FM in September 2004. 2FM in turn raided Phantom FM for Cormac Battle, Jenny Huston and Dan Hegarty, while Colm &amp; Jim-Jim were poached from FM104. Old stalwarts such as Dave Fanning and Larry Gogan were moved to the weekend to make way for the likes of Rick O&#x27;Shea and Nikki Hayes. The Gerry Ryan Show continued to be the most popular programme on the station and one of the top-rated radio programmes in the country.

In 1999, veteran producer and disc jockey John Clarke was made Head of 2FM. Unlike the previous people in that position, John had worked his way through a number of pirate stations before joining RTÉ in the late eighties. He rebranded 2FM with a new blue and red logo (as &quot;RTÉ 2fm&quot;) and re-arranged the schedule.
During this period (Late 1990s/Early 2000s) long serving station names such as Andy Ruane, Lorcan Murray, Michael McNamara, Mike Ryan, Suzanne Duffy, Peter Collins, Bob Conway, Simon Young and Gerry Wison disappeared from the schedule.

In 2003, Ryan Tubridy was poached from RTÉ Radio 1 to present &quot;The Full Irish&quot; breakfast programme; however in 2005 he returned to Radio 1 for a number of years, heralding an era of instability in breakfast broadcasting as first Ruth Scott and Rick O&#x27;Shea took charge of &quot;The Rick and Ruth Breakfast Show&quot;, before being replaced 5 months later by Marty Whelan in September 2005. DJ Mark McCabe and John Power arrived to present dance music shows at weekends. Later, more changes saw Larry Gogan being moved from his lunchtime slot to &quot;drive time&quot;. A news programme, &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, was added to the schedules in response to criticisms that RTÉ 2fm was not fulfilling its remit as a public service broadcaster. Newer alternative DJs such as the &quot;Phantom 3&quot;, Canadian Jenny Huston, Dan Hegarty and Kerbdog front-man Cormac Battle also joined the line-up, as did Jennifer Greene.

From 1999 to 2007 Will Leahy presented the most popular weekend show in the station&#x27;s history, &#x27;The Saturday Show&#x27;. It was broadcast live from Limerick each Saturday. This programme ended its run in 2007 with a record 252,000 listeners, the station&#x27;s second most successful show in its history after only The Gerry Ryan Show.

On 12 January 2007 RTÉ announced a major revamp of 2fm with the axing of Marty Whelan&#x27;s breakfast show to make way for &quot;The Colm &amp; Jim-Jim Breakfast Show&quot; as 2fm engaged in a spot of poaching for once in persuading Colm Hayes and Jim-Jim Nugent to leave FM104. As FM104 continues to broadcast its breakfast show under &quot;The Strawberry Alarm Clock&quot; title, the 2fm version was known as the &quot;Colm and Jim-Jim Breakfast Show&quot; (initially referred to in pre-publicity as the &quot;2fm Alarm Clock&quot;, however the name was changed after FM104 threatened legal action). During this 2007 revamp Will Leahy, formerly of the &quot;Saturday Show&quot;, was promoted to the weekday Drivetime slot, which he broadcast from his base at the RTÉ Limerick studios on the fifth floor of the Cornmarket. Larry Gogan was moved to the weekend and Dave Fanning moved to Radio 1 for a period (though he still presented a Sunday night programme on 2fm). The new schedule launched on 5 March 2007.

John Clarke resigned unexpectedly his position as Head of RTÉ 2fm on 14 August 2009. Four days later, and after spending some time presenting on RTÉ Radio 1, it was announced that Dave Fanning would be returning to RTÉ 2fm to present his evening weekday show in his old 7pm slot.

===The John McMahon years (20092013)===
Clarke was replaced by John McMahon the following month. The return of Fanning followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers, while Larry Gogan also returned to weekday lunch-times. There was comment within the Irish media when, despite electing to target a middle-aged audience, the radio station opted in September 2009 not to playlist David Gray, an English singer-songwriter who was popular with that age group in Ireland. Gray&#x27;s music was played on Today FM and other stations at the time. In spite of this arrangement, Gray has since turned up on &quot;Celebrity Sunday&quot;, a programme featuring celebrities and which, when it featured Nicky Byrne, became a Twittertrending topic. McMahon began his reign by bringing in several schedule changes from early 2010, new additions to the station included the arrivals of Hector Ó hEochagáin and Tommy Tiernan live from Galway, and &#x27;Celebrity Sunday&#x27; which included guest presenters such as Louis Walsh, Neil Hannon, Thomas Walsh, Mike Scott and Nicky Byrne.

In the aftermath of the sudden death of Gerry Ryan in 2010, a number of changes were made to the schedule. Hector Ó hEochagáin headed a breakfast show called &#x27;Breakfast with Hector&#x27; which broadcast live from Galway each morning. Ryan Tubridy took over the 9am11am slot, with Rick O&#x27;Shea the main afternoon anchor. Will Leahy presented the drive time slot, a show which he broadcast live from Limerick for seven years.

===The Dan Healy years (2013present)===
In 2014 following the appointment of Dan Healy as head of 2fm, the schedule was revamped. On 17 December 2013 RTÉ announced that Hector Ó hEochagáin would finish presenting the breakfast show. He was replaced by Jennifer Maguire, Bernard O&#x27;Shea and Keith Walsh. The regionally produced breakfast and drive time shows were axed, and all weekday shows were centralised to Dublin. An online campaign protested at the removal of Will Leahy and Hector Ó hEochagáin from their regionally produced shows. Larry Gogan, Dave Fanning and Will Leahy were moved to the weekend. Nicky Byrne took over the 11am2pm slot. 

In 2016, RTÉ 2fm received new branding, new content and a new website.

The show hosted by Jennifer Maguire, Bernard O&#x27;Shea and Keith Walsh was called the Breakfast Republic which is the second-longest running show, lasting over 5 years, with the majority of its presenters resigning to other shows across RTÉ. Doireann Garrihy and Eoghan McDermott fronted the show in the following two years, followed by Garrihy continuing with new hosts Carl Mullan and Donncha O&#x27;Callaghan until her resignation in May 2024. Mullan and O&#x27;Callaghan continued with new host Aifric O&#x27;Connell. However this was shortly followed by O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s departure in July. This was a period of a lot of change at 2FM, as Jennifer Maguire left the show, along with the 2 Johnnies as well. In January 2025, there was a major upheaval announced at 2FM which announced a slew of changes focussing on bringing some new voices into the station along with some old voices in Doireann Garrihy returning. Some of the stalwarts at the station, like Aifric O&#x27;Connell, Taran O&#x27;Sullivan, David O&#x27;Reilly, Blathnaid Treacy have seemingly disappeared from the roster.

===2FM Song Contest===

In 1982, 2FM held its first annual Song Contest with the goal of finding Ireland&#x27;s most talented songwriter. The contest was created by producer/presenter Kevin Hough and continued for 25 years. Winners included Naimee Coleman, Laura Izabor, RuthAnne and Dave Geraghty.

== Logos ==
In January 2016, a new logo was revealed which replaced the old one that had been in use for seven years.

==Digital sister stations==
The launch of digital radio into Ireland has allowed RTÉ to expand their music radio operation. Whereas 2fm has to play a mix of genres of pop, the digital stations can play a wider range of music and focus more tightly on a particular format. RTÉ operates three music-led digital stations, which could be described as sister stations to 2fm: RTÉ 2XM, a station playing new and alternative music; RTÉ Gold, a station playing popular music from before 1990; and RTÉ Pulse, a station playing dance and electronic music.
There is also a chill out music service, RTÉ Chill, which shares a broadcast slot with children station RTÉ Junior.

<doc id="623140" wikidata="Q5194037" url="?curid=623140" title="Cumbria Way">
<text>The Cumbria Way is a linear long-distance footpath in Cumbria, England.
 The majority of the route is inside the boundaries of the Lake District National Park. Linking the two historic Cumbrian towns of Ulverston and Carlisle, it passes through the towns of Coniston and Keswick. The route cuts through Lakeland country via Coniston Water, Langdale, Borrowdale, Derwent Water, Skiddaw Forest and Caldbeck. It is a primarily low-level route with some high-level exposed sections.

==History==
The Cumbria Way was originally devised in the 1970s by local Ramblers Association members. The waymarking of the entire route was completed by volunteers and national park staff in May 2007.

==Route==
The route can be walked in either direction but is described here as south to north beginning at the trailhead of Ulverston and ending in Carlisle.

===Stage 1: Ulverston to Coniston===

The route leaves the urban area of Ulverston, birthplace of Stan Laurel, and heads north towards the village of Gawthwaite and the boundary of the Lake District National Park. The trail, which consists primarily of field paths at this stage, leads to the settlement of Sunny Bank and the shore of Coniston Water, the western shoreline of which is followed before reaching the settlement of Coniston. Grizedale Forest is visible to the east of the lake with Coniston Old Man and Dow Crag being visible to the west on approach to Coniston. This stage is approximately in length.

===Stage 2: Coniston to Langdale===

The route leaves Coniston heading in a NNW direction through woodland towards Tarn Hows. The way involves some road walking as it passes through the villages of Colwith and Skelwith Bridge. The Langdale Pikes soon become visible as the route leaves Skelwith Bridge in a NNE direction, passing Elter Water before entering the Great Langdale valley. This stage is approximately in length.

===Stage 3: Langdale to Keswick===

The route leaves Langdale and travels alongside Mickleden beck, with the mountain of Bow Fell to the west and Langdale Pikes to the east. After a significant gain in elevation the route crosses Stake Pass before descending via Langstrath beck and turning towards the villages of Stonethwaite and Rosthwaite. The route subsequently follows the River Derwent before reaching Derwent Water where it follows the shoreline path to reach the town of Keswick. The mountains Skiddaw and Blencathra may be visible to the north. This stage is approximately in length.

===Stage 4: Keswick to Caldbeck===

After some urban walking on the exit from Keswick, the route crosses the A591 road before ascending past Latrigg towards Skiddaw House Youth Hostel. After crossing the area of fells known as Back o&#x27;Skiddaw the route passes High Pike and the Caldbeck Fells before descending towards the village of Caldbeck. This stage is approximately in length.

===Stage 5: Caldbeck to Carlisle===

After leaving the village of Caldbeck this final low-level section of the route follows the course of the River Caldew to the city of Carlisle, Cumbria&#x27;s county town. The route passes through the villages of Sebergham, Buckabank and Dalston primarily following woodland and farmland public footpaths and bridleways. This stage is approximately in length.

==Geology and biology==

===Flora and fauna===
The tarns encountered on the route provide a habitat for a wide range of species including vendace, charr, crayfish and schelly.

The red squirrel can be found in woodland encountered on the route.

The high precipitation in the ancient woodland encountered throughout the route provides a favourable habitat for mosses, liverworts, ferns and lichens. The boggy areas encountered, particularly on the high-level parts of the route, provide a habitat for carnivorous plants including sundew and butterwort.

== Connecting trails ==
The route connects with the Allerdale Ramble, Cumbria Coastal Way, Coast to Coast Walk, Hadrian&#x27;s wall path, Cistercian Way, Eden Way and Windermere Way.

<text>John Howard Griffin (June 16, 1920 – September 9, 1980) was an American journalist and author from Texas who wrote about and championed racial equality. He is best known for his 1959 project to temporarily pass as a black man and journey through the Deep South in order to see life and segregation from the other side of the color line first-hand. He first published a series of articles on his experience in &quot;Sepia&quot; magazine, which had underwritten the project, then later published an expanded account in book form, under the title &quot;Black Like Me&quot; (1961). This was later adapted into a 1964 film of the same name. A 50th anniversary edition of the book was published in 2011 by Wings Press.

==Early life==
Griffin was born in 1920 in Dallas, Texas, to John Walter Griffin and Lena May Young. His mother was a classical pianist, and Griffin acquired his love of music from her. Awarded a musical scholarship, he went to France to study French language and literature at the University of Poitiers and medicine at the École de Médecine. At 19, he joined the French Resistance as a medic, working at the Atlantic seaport of Saint-Nazaire, where he helped smuggle Austrian Jews to safety and freedom in England.

Griffin returned to the United States and enlisted, serving 39 months in the United States Army Air Forces stationed in the South Pacific, during which he was decorated for bravery. He spent 1943–44 as the only European-American on Nuni, one of the Solomon Islands, where he was assigned to study the local culture. He had a bout with spinal malaria that left him temporarily paraplegic. During this year, Griffin married an island woman. In 1946, he went slowly blind, the after effect of a severe concussion that he had received from a Japanese bomb. He would remain blind until inexplicably regaining his sight in 1957.

He returned home to Texas without his wife and converted to Catholicism in 1952, becoming a Lay Carmelite. He taught piano. He gained dispensation from the Vatican for a second marriage. He married one of his students, Elizabeth Ann Holland, and they had four children.

In 1952, he published his first novel, &quot;The Devil Rides Outside,&quot; a mystery set in a monastery in postwar France, where a young American composer goes to study Gregorian chant.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Griffin wrote a number of essays about his loss of sight and his life, followed by his spontaneous return of sight in 1957. At that point he began to develop as a photographer.

He published &quot;Nuni&quot; (1956), a semi-autobiographical novel drawing from his year &quot;marooned&quot; in the Solomon Islands. It shows his developing interest in ethnography. He conducted a kind of social study in his 1959 project, resulting in his book &quot;Black Like Me&quot; (1961).

==&quot;Black Like Me&quot;==

In the fall of 1959, Griffin decided to investigate firsthand the plight of African Americans in the South, where racial segregation was legal; blacks had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century and closed out of the political system, and whites were struggling to maintain dominance against an increasing civil rights movement.

Griffin consulted a New Orleans dermatologist for aid in darkening his skin, being treated with a course of drugs, sunlamp treatments, and skin creams. Griffin shaved his head in order to hide his straight hair. He spent six weeks travelling as a black man in New Orleans and parts of Mississippi (with side trips to South Carolina and Georgia), getting around mainly by bus and by hitchhiking. He was later accompanied by a photographer who documented the trip, and the project was underwritten by &quot;Sepia&quot; magazine, in exchange for first publication rights for the articles he planned to write. These were published under the title &quot;Journey into Shame.&quot; When he decided to end his journey, in Montgomery, Alabama, he spent three days secluded in a hotel room to avoid the sunlight and stopped taking his skin-darkening medication.

Griffin published an expanded version of his project as &quot;Black Like Me&quot; (1961), which became a best seller in 1961. He described in detail the problems an African American encountered in the segregated Deep South meeting the needs for food, shelter, and toilet and other sanitary facilities. Griffin also described the hatred he often felt from white Southerners he encountered in his daily life—shop clerks, ticket sellers, bus drivers, and others. He was particularly shocked by the curiosity white men displayed about his sexual life. He also included anecdotes about white Southerners who were friendly and helpful.

The wide publicity about the book made Griffin a national celebrity for a time. The book had several editions. In a 1975 essay included in later editions of the book, Griffin recalled encountering hostility and threats to him and his family in his hometown of Mansfield, Texas. Someone hanged his figure in effigy. He eventually moved his family to Mexico for about nine months before they returned to Fort Worth.

The book was adapted as a 1964 film of the same name, starring James Whitmore as Griffin, and featuring Roscoe Lee Browne, Clifton James and Will Geer. A 50th anniversary edition of the book was published in 2011 by Wings Press.

==Later life==
Griffin continued to lecture and write on race relations and social justice during the early years of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1964, he received the Pacem in Terris Award from the Davenport (Iowa) Catholic Interracial Council for his contributions to racial understanding. In 1975, Griffin was severely beaten by the Ku Klux Klan, but survived.

In his later years, Griffin focused on researching his friend Thomas Merton, an American Trappist monk and spiritual writer whom he first met in 1962. Griffin was chosen by Merton&#x27;s estate to write the authorized biography of Merton, but his health (he had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes) prevented him from completing this project. He concentrated on Merton&#x27;s later years.

==Death==
Griffin died in Fort Worth, Texas, on September 9, 1980, at the age of 60, from complications of diabetes. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth Ann Griffin and children. He was buried in the cemetery in his birthplace of Mansfield, Texas. After her death, Elizabeth was also buried there, although she had remarried.

There have been persistent rumors that Griffin died of skin cancer, which purportedly developed from his use of large doses of methoxsalen (&quot;Oxsoralen&quot;) in 1959 to darken his skin for his race project. Griffin did not have skin cancer but he did experience temporary and minor symptoms from taking the drug, especially fatigue and nausea.

==Legacy==
===Posthumous works===
Griffin&#x27;s nearly finished portion of the biography of Thomas Merton, which covered Merton&#x27;s later years, was posthumously published in paperback by Latitude Press in 1983 as &quot;Follow the Ecstasy: Thomas Merton, the Hermitage Years, 1965–1968.&quot;

Griffin&#x27;s essays about his blindness and recovery were collected and published posthumously as &quot;Scattered Shadows: A Memoir of Blindness and Vision&quot; (2004).

In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the publication of &quot;Black Like Me,&quot; Wings Press published a new edition. It also published updated editions of Griffin&#x27;s other works, including his first novel, &quot;The Devil Rides Outside.&quot;

===Secondary studies===
* Robert Bonazzi wrote a biographical memoir of Griffin: &quot;Man in the Mirror: John Howard Griffin and the Story of Black Like Me&quot; (1997). Bonazzi had published other works by Griffin at his Latitudes Press. In 2018, TCU Press published Bonazzi&#x27;s &quot;Reluctant Activist: The Spiritual Life and Art of John Howard Griffin&quot;.
* &quot;Uncommon Vision: The Life and Times of John Howard Griffin&quot; is a film documentary released in 2011 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his influential book. Directed and produced by Morgan Atkinson, it was aired on PBS stations. The film is also included as an extra on the 2013 DVD release of the film &quot;Black Like Me&quot;.

==Parallel exercises==
* Ray Sprigle, a Pulitzer Prize-winning white journalist from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, disguised himself in 1948 as a black man and traveled in the Deep South for a month with prominent black Atlanta political leader John Wesley Dobbs, a guide and host provided by the NAACP. Sprigle wrote a 21-part nationally syndicated series of articles under the title &quot;I Was a Negro in the South for 30 Days&quot; that formed the basis of Sprigle&#x27;s 1949 book &quot;In the Land of Jim Crow&quot;. &quot;30 Days a Black Man&quot; (Lyons Press, 2017) by journalist Bill Steigerwald details Sprigle&#x27;s undercover mission and the stir it created in the media in 1948.
* Grace Halsell, a white female journalist, also Texan, who, inspired by Griffin, disguised herself as black in a similar manner. Shortly after the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., she left her position on President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s White House staff for the journey she described as &quot;embracing the Other&quot;. She published her account the next year as &quot;Soul Sister: The Story of a White Woman Who Turned Herself Black and Went to Live and Work in Harlem and Mississippi&quot;. She undertook many similar immersive disguises throughout her career.
* Günter Wallraff, a white German undercover journalist who often immersed himself in parts to reveal the treatment of others (an alcoholic, a worker in a chemicals factory, a homeless person), and released the 2009 documentary &quot;Black on White&quot;, showing how he was treated in Germany while undercover as a black man.

<doc id="623143" wikidata="Q144887" url="?curid=623143" title="18610 Arthurdent">
<text>18610 Arthurdent (provisional designation ) is an asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 3.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 February 1998, by a team of astronomers including Felix Hormuth at Starkenburg Observatory in Heppenheim, Germany. The asteroid was named after Arthur Dent from Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series.

== Orbit and classification ==
Arthurdent orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,485 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The first known precovery image was taken during the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) at Palomar Observatory in 1988, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 10 years prior to its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Arthurdent measures 3.5 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.234. This agrees with a generic absolute magnitude-to-diameter conversion for a silicaceous asteroid (albedo of 0.25), which gives a diameter of approximately 3 kilometers for an absolute magnitude of 14.3.

=== Rotation period ===
As of 2017, the Arthurdent&#x27;s composition, rotation period and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named after Arthur Dent, the bewildered hero of Douglas Adams&#x27;s radio play and book &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The naming of the asteroid was announced by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in its &quot;Minor Planet Circular&quot; on 9 May 2001 (). Two days later, Adams died of a heart attack in Santa Barbara, California.

=== Coincidence with death ===
The near coincidence of these events led to some media reports of the asteroid naming appearing after Adams&#x27;s death was reported, and to assumptions that the two events occurred on the same day, even by those connected to the naming: on 14 May 2001, German amateur astronomer Reiner Stoss at the Starkenburg Observatory wrote: &quot;You may have heard the sad news that Douglas Adams passed away last Friday. By accident on the same day the naming of minor planet (18610) Arthurdent was announced by the Minor Planet Center. We wanted to make Mr. Adams a joy, but did never dare to think that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to receive this surprise, when we sent our name proposal to the MPC a few months back.&quot;

<text>The sella turcica (Latin for &#x27;Turkish saddle&#x27;) is a saddle-shaped depression in the body of the sphenoid bone of the human skull and of the skulls of other hominids including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. It serves as a cephalometric landmark. The pituitary gland or hypophysis is located within the most inferior aspect of the sella turcica, the hypophyseal fossa.

==Structure==
The sella turcica is located in the sphenoid bone behind the chiasmatic groove and the tuberculum sellae. It belongs to the middle cranial fossa.

The sella turcica&#x27;s most inferior portion is known as the hypophyseal fossa (the &quot;seat of the saddle&quot;), and contains the pituitary gland (hypophysis). In front of the hypophyseal fossa is the tuberculum sellae.

Completing the formation of the saddle posteriorly is the dorsum sellae, which is continuous with the clivus, inferoposteriorly. The dorsum sellae is terminated laterally by the posterior clinoid processes.

===Development===
It is widely believed that the development of the diaphragma sellae is a factor which determines the morphology of the sella turcica and its contents.

==Function==
The sella turcica forms a bony seat for the pituitary gland.

==Clinical significance==
Empty sella syndrome is the condition of a shrunken or flattened pituitary gland.

Since the sella turcica forms a bony caudal border for the pituitary gland, a pituitary tumor usually extends upward in the rostral direction into the suprasellar region. This can result in compression of the optic chiasm, which lies on top of the pituitary, enveloping the pituitary stalk. Compression of the optic chiasm can lead to bitemporal hemianopsia, and, when there is no relevant trauma, this clinical finding is pathognomonic for a pituitary tumor.

Some pituitary adenomas can extend inferiorly, growing downward and invading the sphenoid bone and cavernous sinus. Large adenomas can cause remodeling of the underlying sphenoid bone altering the shape of the sella turcica.

Sella turcica is also usually used as a reference point with nasion to establish the base of the skull in cephalometric analysis. This is commonly done prior to orthodontic treatment.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sella turcica&quot; is from the Latin words &quot;sella&quot;, meaning seat, and &quot;turcica&quot;, meaning Turkish.

<text>Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers (sometimes stylized as &quot;Buddy Wasisname &amp; The Other Fellers&quot;, though the official name does not contain the &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol) is a musical and comedy trio from Newfoundland and Labrador, founded in 1983 and composed of Kevin Blackmore (&quot;Buddy Wasisname&quot;), Wayne Chaulk, Byron Pardy and Ray Johnson (&quot;The Other Fellers&quot;). The group specializes in Newfoundland and folk music, and performs comedic skits and stand-up routines.

Chaulk performs on bass or guitar, Johnson on accordion or fiddle, and Blackmore on mandolin, fiddle, banjo, guitar and improvised percussion instruments including Tupperware lids and garbage bags. Byron Pardy performs on bass and backing vocals. All three musicians sing and write songs which reflect their Newfoundland heritage; Johnson also arranges traditional accordion numbers for the band to perform. Their recordings range from serious reflections on Newfoundland culture to light-hearted tales that border on the ridiculous (e.g. &quot;Is You &#x27;Appy?&quot; and &quot;Chainsaw Earle&quot;). They have produced 15 albums, 2 of which are purely comedy focused, 5 compilation albums, and 5 live DVDs.

==Name==
The group&#x27;s name, and the names of many of their albums and songs, contain phonetic spellings of colloquial contractions and phrases native to Newfoundland, which would normally only be spoken aloud and in an informal setting. This reflects the group&#x27;s focus on Newfoundland culture; most Newfoundlanders immediately recognize the intended meanings despite the atypical spelling. The band name plays on Newfoundlanders&#x27; habit of rapidly slurring words together; &quot;wasisname&quot; is a contraction of &quot;what&#x27;s his name?&quot;; however, in Newfoundland &quot;Buddy Wasisname&quot; is simply a version of &quot;I can&#x27;t remember his name&quot;. &quot;Fellers&quot; is simply a dialectal form of &quot;fellas&quot; or &quot;fellows&quot;.

==History==

Two of the group&#x27;s members (Johnson and Chaulk) were school teachers prior to forming the band. Their first album, &quot;Makin&#x27; For the Harbour&quot; was self-released in 1986. The album relied heavily on Newfoundland standards and Blackmore&#x27;s comedy numbers; &quot;Gotta Get Me Moose B&#x27;y&quot; would become their early career signature tune, and remains one of their more popular songs. Their next album was &quot;Nods&#x27;N&#x27;Winks&quot;, which was released in 1988.

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Flatout&quot;, was released in 1990, and contains &quot;Saltwater Joys&quot;, the band&#x27;s most requested concert song. Another song on the album, &quot;Peein&#x27; in the Snow&quot; also became a hit after being performed on several comedy programs. In 1992, they released &quot;The Miracle Cure&quot;, the band&#x27;s best-selling album. This album contains &quot;Chainsaw Earle&quot;; several traditional songs and &quot;The Pits&quot;, for which a video was produced.

In 1993, the band released &quot;100% Pure&quot;. It includes The &quot;Song for Newfoundland&quot;, an a cappella anthem written by Chaulk, has often been covered often by Newfoundland vocal groups. The album contains the well-known song &quot;By The Glow Of The Kerosene Light&quot;, written by Wince Coles, which featured additional players on cello, harp and piano, an arrangement not often seen in the group&#x27;s catalogue.

At the 1994 East Coast Music Awards, Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers won the award for Live Artist of the Year and the award for Group Recording of the Year.

The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Salt Beef Junkie&quot;, includes original songs of the same type, but the arrangements deviate from their usual style. The opening track features a full rock backing band in addition to Chaulk&#x27;s guitar and Johnson&#x27;s accordion; &quot;He&#x27;s A Part Of Me&quot; features the same backing trio as &quot;Kerosene Light&quot;; and many of the tracks feature George Morgan&#x27;s drum machines.

The group maintains an active touring schedule throughout the Atlantic provinces and other Canadian cities. In 2017, when their website was last updated, they reported playing 58 concerts.

At the East Coast Music Association&#x27;s 2021 ECMA Awards, Buddy Wasisname &amp; The Other Fellers received the Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors Award, in recognition of their long-term contribution to the East Coast music industry.

On December 29, 2022, Blackmore, Chaulk and Johnson were named Members of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="623149" wikidata="Q615972" url="?curid=623149" title="Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego">
<text>Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego (MCRD San Diego) is a United States Marine Corps military installation in San Diego, California. It lies between San Diego Bay and Interstate 5, adjacent to San Diego International Airport and the former Naval Training Center San Diego. MCRD San Diego&#x27;s main mission is the initial training of enlisted male and female recruits living west of the Mississippi River. Over 21,000 recruits are trained each year. As of 2022, 1.5 million recruits have completed their boot camp training at the depot. It is also the home to the Marine Corps&#x27; Recruiter School and Drill Instructors School.

==History==
The Marines made an amphibious landing in San Diego in 1846 from and during the Mexican–American War. The Marines made a presence in San Diego again in July 1914, but ground was not broken for a permanent base until March 2, 1919. The initial proposal for the base came from Congressman William Kettner, who also proposed construction of Naval Training Center San Diego. The Marine base only became a reality due to the perseverance of its first commanding officer, Colonel Joseph Henry Pendleton (later a general and the namesake of Camp Pendleton). Before the commissioning of the base on Dutch Flats, the Marines were based in Balboa Park. The structures were designed by architect Bertram Goodhue in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, and they echoed the style used for the buildings of the 1915 Panama–California Exposition (also inspired by Goodhue). The base and its original buildings are now on the National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California.

On December 1, 1921, the base was formally commissioned as the Marine Advanced Expeditionary Base San Diego. In 1923, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot for the west coast was relocated to the new base in San Diego from Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California. On March 1, 1924, the base became officially the Marine Corps Base San Diego. It became the Marine Corps&#x27; recruit training center for the western United States. During World War II, the flow of recruits into the base surged, with 18,000 recruits arriving in one month. On January 1, 1948, the base was officially renamed Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.

==Recruit training==

The base&#x27;s main mission is to train new United States Marine Corps recruits, specifically males recruited from west of the Mississippi River, but also from some areas east of the river, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, the Chicago metropolitan area and New Orleans. Until 2021, all female recruits were trained at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.

Recruit training for those enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, includes a thirteen-week process during which the recruit becomes cut off from the civilian world and must adapt to a Marine Corps lifestyle. During training, drill instructors train recruits in a wide variety of subjects including weapons training, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, personal hygiene and cleanliness, close order drill, and Marine Corps history. The training emphasizes physical fitness, and recruits must attain a minimum standard of fitness to graduate by passing a Physical Fitness Test. Recruits must also meet minimum combat-oriented swimming qualifications, qualify in rifle marksmanship with the M16A4 service rifle, and pass a 54-hour simulated combat exercise known as &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

Unlike training at Parris Island, recruits must leave the depot to conduct field training. At Edson Range aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, recruits fire on the rifle range, conduct field training, and undergo the Crucible. At the conclusion, recruits return to MCRD San Diego for Marine week and then graduation.

On December 14, 2020, the depot agreed to accept female recruits. On December 17, 2020, three women successfully completed training at the depot to become drill instructors. 60 female recruits would then begin training at the San Diego depot&#x27;s boot camp in February 2021. Despite training alongside men, it was acknowledged that female drill instructors were put in charge of training the women recruits. On April 22, 2021, 53 of these female recruits became Marines after becoming the first women to complete boot camp training at the San Diego Depot.

==Tenant organizations and facilities==
In addition to recruit training, MCRD San Diego is also home to the Drill Instructor&#x27;s School for the Western Recruiting Region and the Recruiter&#x27;s School for the entire Marine Corps.
U.S. Coast Guard units are also stationed at MCRD, including a USCG Pacific Area Tactical Law Enforcement Detachment and a USCG Maritime Safety and Security Team.

MCRD base is also home to the MCRD San Diego Command Museum.

Several schools pertinent to the Marine Corps mission are and have been based at MCRD. Among these was the &quot;Sea School,&quot; which trained the Marine Detachments for duty aboard Naval vessels. The Communications and Electronics School was formerly located there.

The parade deck at MCRD San Diego serves both as a vital part of every recruit&#x27;s training and as a memorial to the veterans of WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and the war on terror. It also divides the portion of the base dedicated to recruit training from the sections housing other schools and administrative personnel.

==Possibility of closure==
Some politicians have pushed for the closure of MCRD San Diego, primarily because it occupies what is now extremely valuable land adjacent to the city&#x27;s harbor and airport. Although the installation was not on the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure list proposed by the Pentagon, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission asked the Pentagon for a written explanation as to why the MCRD was not proposed to be closed and consolidated into the depot at Parris Island. The Commission noted that the Navy and Air Force had successfully consolidated training facilities without risk to the mission or risk of loss of &quot;surge capability&quot; (the ability to quickly increase the rate of recruit training if circumstances make that necessary). They also noted that the military value of San Diego is lower than Parris Island due in part to encroachment and land constraints. 
Closure meets heavy resistance from the Marine Corps, because of the status of the parade deck as a memorial to veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, as well as the cost of relocation of the Depot. In a July 14, 2005 public response to the commission, Gordon R. England, the acting Deputy Secretary of Defense, stated that the Department of Defense did not recommend San Diego&#x27;s closure because it would create a single point of failure in regard to Parris Island&#x27;s vulnerability to hurricanes, among other threats. He also noted that the payback on such a closure would take over 100 years, due to the need for new construction at Parris Island and the need to relocate rather than eliminate personnel from San Diego.

<doc id="623150" wikidata="Q4346098" url="?curid=623150" title="Windage">
<text>Windage is a term used in aerodynamics, firearms ballistics, and automobiles that mainly relates to the effects of air (e.g., wind) on an object of interest. The term is also used for the similar effects of liquids, such as oil.

==Usage==
=== Aerodynamics ===
Windage is a force created on an object by friction when there is relative movement between air and the object. Windage loss is the reduction in efficiency due to windage forces.

For example, electric motors are affected by friction between the rotor and air. Large alternators have significant losses due to windage. To reduce losses, hydrogen gas may be used, since it is less dense.

There are two causes of windage:
# The object is moving and being slowed by resistance from the air.
# A wind is blowing, producing a force on the object.

The term can refer to:
* The effect of the force, for example the deflection of a missile or an aircraft by a cross wind.
* The area and shape of the object that make it susceptible to friction, for example those parts of a boat that are exposed to the wind.

Aerodynamic streamlining can be used to reduce windage.

There is a hydrodynamic effect similar to windage, hydrodynamic drag.

=== Ballistics ===
In firearms parlance, the word &quot;windage&quot; refers to the sight adjustment used to compensate for the horizontal deviation of the projectile trajectory from the intended point of impact due to wind drift or Coriolis effect. By contrast, the adjustment for the vertical deviation is the &quot;elevation&quot;.

The colloquial term &quot;Kentucky windage&quot; refers to the practice of holding the aim to the upwind side of the target (also known as deflection shooting or &quot;leading&quot; the wind) to compensate for wind drift, without actually changing the existing adjustment settings on the gunsight.

In muzzleloading firearms, &quot;windage&quot; also refers to the difference in diameter between the bore and the ball, especially in muskets and cannons. The bore gap allows the shot to be loaded quickly, but reduces the efficiency of the weapon&#x27;s internal ballistics, as it allows gas to leak past the projectile. It also reduces the accuracy, as the ball takes a zig-zag path along the barrel, emerging out of the muzzle at an unpredictable angle.

=== Automobiles ===
In automotive parlance, windage refers to parasitic drag on the crankshaft due to sump oil splashing on the crank train during rough driving, as well as dissipating energy in turbulence from the crank train moving the crankcase gas and oil mist at high RPM. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump and back to the oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.

<doc id="623153" wikidata="Q877429" url="?curid=623153" title="Danes (tribe)">
<text>The Danes were a North Germanic tribe inhabiting southern Scandinavia, including the area now comprising Denmark proper, northern and eastern England, and the Scanian provinces of modern-day southern Sweden, during the Nordic Iron Age and the Viking Age. They founded what became the Kingdom of Denmark. The name of their realm is believed to mean &quot;Danish March&quot;, viz. &quot;the march of the Danes&quot;, in Old Norse, referring to their southern border zone between the Eider and Schlei rivers, known as the Danevirke.

==Origins==

The origin of the Danes remains undetermined, but several ancient historical documents and texts refer to them and archaeology has revealed and continues to reveal insights into their culture, cultural beliefs, beliefs organization and way of life. A 2025 study in &quot;Nature&quot; found genetic evidence of an influx of central European population after about 500 AD into the region later ruled by the Danes. 

The Danes first appear in written history in the 6th century with references in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot; (551 AD), by Procopius, and by Gregory of Tours. 
In his description of Scandza, Jordanes says that the Dani were of the same stock as the &quot;Suetidi&quot; (&quot;Swedes&quot;) and expelled the Heruli and took their lands.

The Old English poems &quot;Widsith&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as well as works by later Scandinavian writers (notably by Saxo Grammaticus ( 1200)), provide some of the original written references to the Danes. According to the 12th-century author Sven Aggesen, the mythical King Dan gave his name to the Danes.

==Culture==
===Language===
The Danes spoke Proto-Norse which gradually evolved into the Old Norse language by the beginning of the Viking Age. They spoke &quot;dǫnsk tunga&quot; (Danish tongue), which the Danes shared with the people in Norway and Sweden and later in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

Like previous and contemporary people of Scandinavia, the Danes used runes for writing, but did not write much apparently, as they have left no literary legacy except for occasional rune stones and carvings in wood and various items like weapons, utensils and jewellery.

===Religion===
As previous and contemporary peoples of Scandinavia (the Vikings), the tribal Danes were practitioners of the Norse religion. Around 500 AD, many of the gods of the Norse pantheon had lost their previous significance, except a few such as Thor, Odin and Frey who were increasingly worshipped. During the 10th century of the late Viking Age, the Danes officially adopted Christianity, as evidenced by several rune stones, documents and church buildings. The new Christian influences also show in their art, jewellery and burial practices of the late Viking Age, but the transition was not rapid and definitive and older customs from the Norse religion remained to be practised to various degrees.

Some sources, such as the &quot;Beowulf&quot;, point to a very early Arianism in Denmark, but it has been a matter of intense academic debate for many years whether these sources reflect later adjustments or an actual early Germanic Christianity among the Danes in the Iron Age. There are several archaeological artefacts in and from Denmark however, made as early as the 500s, depicting Daniel among the lions, so the Danes must have had some knowledge of and influence from Arian cultures.

==Iron Age==

In the Nordic Iron Age, the Danes were based in present-day Zealand and Scania (and neighbouring parts of present-day Sweden). Until around the 6th century, Jutland was the homeland of two other Germanic tribes: the Jutes in what is now North Jutland, and the Angles in South Jutland (especially Angeln). 

The &quot;Widsith&quot; mentions two semi-mythical kings in relation to the Danes of the Iron Age. Sigar who ruled the &quot;Sea-Danes&quot; and Offa who ruled both Danes and Angles. Centuries later, Saxo lists for the first time the Danes entire lineage of semi-mythical kings, starting from King Dan. As Saxo&#x27;s texts are the first written accounts of Denmark&#x27;s history, and hence the Danes, his sources are largely surviving legends, folk lore and word of mouth.

The royal seat and capital of the Danes was located on Zealand near Lejre and constituted what has later been dubbed the Lejre Kingdom, ruled by the Skjöldung dynasty.

Some time around the middle of the First Millennium, both Jutland and Angeln became part of Danish kingdom or kingdoms. So was southern Schleswig (now the northernmost part of Germany) – the site of Danevirke, a large set of fortifications reportedly built by Danes to mark the southern border of their realm. It was extended several times in later centuries.

==Viking Age==

Beginning in the 8th century, the Danes initiated the construction of trading towns across their realm, including Hedeby, Ribe, Aarhus and Viborg and expanded existing settlements such as Odense and Aalborg. Hedeby quickly grew to become the largest settlement in Scandinavia and remained so until its eventual destruction in the later half of the 11th century.

From around 800 AD, the Danes began a long era of well-organised raids across the coasts and rivers of Europe. Some of the raids were followed by a gradual succession of Danish settlers and during this epoch, large areas outside Scandinavia were settled by the Danes, including the Danelaw in England and countryside and newly established towns in Ireland, the Netherlands and northern France. In the early 11th century, King Cnut the Great (died 1035) ruled the extensive North Sea Empire for nearly 20 years, consisting of Denmark, England, Norway, southern Sweden and parts of northern Germany.

During the 10th century the royal seat of the Danes was moved from Lejre to Jelling in central Jutland, marking the foundation and consolidation of the Kingdom of Denmark.

===Danelaw===
In the British Isles, Danes landed three Viking ships at the isle of Portland, Dorset in 786 AD, where they met and killed a local reeve and his men. In 793 AD, a Viking raid and plunder of the monastery at Lindisfarne took place, but no further activity in England followed until 835 AD. In that year, the Danes raided and built a permanent camp on the Isle of Sheppey in south east England and settling followed from 865, when brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless wintered in East Anglia. Halfdan and Ivar moved north and captured Northumbria in 867 and York as well. Danelaw – a special rule of law – was soon established in the settled areas and shaped the local cultures there for centuries. Cultural remains are still noticeable today.

===Ireland===
The Danes first arrived in Ireland in 795 AD, at Rathlin Island, initiating subsequent raids and fortified trade settlements, so called longphorts. During the Viking Age, they established many coastal towns including Dublin (Dyflin), Cork, Waterford (Veðrafjǫrðr) and Limerick (Hlymrekr) and Danish settlers followed. There were many small skirmishes and larger battles with the native Irish clans in the following two centuries, with the Danes sometimes siding with allied clans. In 1014 AD, at the Battle of Clontarf, the Vikings were eventually defeated and the remaining Danish settlers gradually assimilated with the Irish population.

===Frisia===
The first Vikings appeared in Frisia, now part of the Netherlands and Germany, in 800 AD, when Danes plundered coastal settlements and later the trade town of Dorestad became a frequent target of raids. During this time, Frisia was ruled by the Franks and in the mid-9th century, the Danish chieftain of Roric received the western parts of the Netherlands as a fief and established here.

The Danes were probably involved in Frisia much earlier as Gregory of Tours (c. 538–594 AD) mentions a Danish king Chlochilaichus who was killed there while invading Frankish territory in the early 6th century.

===France===

The first known Viking raid in what now constitutes France, commenced in 799, when an attack was fought off on the coast of Aquitaine. Several other smaller skirmishes with aggressive Vikings from primarily Danish territory have been recorded, including the first raid on the Seine in 820, but it was not until the year 834 before Viking activity in France took off on a grand scale. In that year, Danes established a lasting base on Noirmoutier island, a central spot for the European salt trade at the time, and poured into the Loire Valley on larger raid expeditions. Many large scale raids followed all across the coasts and in-land rivers of Western Europe in subsequent decades.

In the beginning of the 900s, Vikings had established an encampment and base in the lower parts of the Seine river around Rouen. In an effort to stop or reduce the relentless raids, Charles the Simple made a treaty in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with the Viking chieftain of Rollo in 911, granting Rollo and his Danish men authority over the area now known as Normandy. This prompted Scandinavian settlers to establish themselves here and in the course of the next couple of centuries, the Norman culture emerged in Normandy.

==Historical texts==

Important historical documents that tell about the tribal Danes include:

* &quot;Widsith&quot;
* &quot;Beowulf&quot;. This poem describes an event in Lejre around the year 500 CE and was probably originally written shortly after.
* Saxo Grammaticus: &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Deeds of The Danes) written in the 12th century.

<text>Assessment of kidney function occurs in different ways, using the presence of symptoms and signs, as well as measurements using urine tests, blood tests, and medical imaging. 

Functions of a healthy kidney include maintaining a person&#x27;s fluid balance, maintaining an acid-base balance; regulating electrolytes sodium, and other electrolytes; clearing toxins; regulating blood pressure; and regulating hormones, such as erythropoietin; and activation of vitamin D. The kidney is also involved in maintaining blood pH balance.

==Description ==

The functions of the kidney include maintenance of acid-base balance; regulation of fluid balance; regulation of sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes; clearance of toxins; absorption of glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules; regulation of blood pressure; production of various hormones, such as erythropoietin; and activation of vitamin D.

The Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is regarded as the best overall measure of the kidney&#x27;s ability to carry out these numerous functions. An estimate of the GFR is used clinically to determine the degree of kidney impairment and to track the progression of the disease. The GFR, however, does not reveal the source of the kidney disease. This is accomplished by urinalysis, measurement of urine protein excretion, kidney imaging, and, if necessary, kidney biopsy.

Much of renal physiology is studied at the level of the nephron the smallest functional unit of the kidney. Each nephron begins with a filtration component that filters the blood entering the kidney. This filtrate then flows along the length of the nephron, which is a tubular structure lined by a single layer of specialized cells and surrounded by capillaries. The major functions of these lining cells are the reabsorption of water and small molecules from the filtrate into the blood, and the secretion of wastes from the blood into the urine.

Proper function of the kidney requires that it receives and adequately filters blood. This is performed at the microscopic level by many hundreds of thousands of filtration units called renal corpuscles, each of which is composed of a glomerulus and a Bowman&#x27;s capsule. A global assessment of renal function is often ascertained by estimating the rate of filtration, called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

== Clinical assessment ==
Clinical assessment can be used to assess the function of the kidneys. This is because a person with abnormally functioning kidneys may have symptoms that develop. For example, a person with chronic kidney disease may develop oedema due to failure of the kidneys to regulate water balance. They may develop evidence of chronic kidney disease, that can be used to assess its severity, for example high blood pressure, osteoporosis or anaemia. If the kidneys are unable to excrete urea, a person may develop a widespread itch or confusion.

== Urine tests ==
Part of the assessment of kidney function includes the measurement of urine and its contents. Abnormal kidney function may cause too much or too little urine to be produced. The ability of the kidneys to filter protein is often measured, as urine albumin or urine protein levels, measured either at a single instance or, because of variation throughout the day, as 24-hour urine tests.

== Blood tests ==
Blood tests are also used to assess kidney function. These include tests that are intended to directly measure the function of the kidneys, as well as tests that assess the function of the kidneys by looking for evidence of problems associated with abnormal function. One of the measures of kidney function is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Other tests that can assess the function of the kidneys include assessment of electrolyte levels such as potassium and phosphate, assessment of acid-base status by the measurement of bicarbonate levels from a vein, and assessment of the full blood count for anaemia.

===Glomerular filtration rate===

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman&#x27;s capsule per unit time. Creatinine clearance (CCr) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Creatinine clearance exceeds GFR due to creatinine secretion, which can be blocked by cimetidine. Both GFR and CCr may be accurately calculated by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated by formulas using just a blood test result (eGFR and eCCr) The results of these tests are used to assess the excretory function of the kidneys. Staging of chronic kidney disease is based on categories of GFR as well as albuminuria and cause of kidney disease.

Central to the physiologic maintenance of GFR is the differential basal tone of the afferent and efferent arterioles (see diagram). In other words, the filtration rate is dependent on the difference between the higher blood pressure created by vasoconstriction of the input or afferent arteriole versus the lower blood pressure created by lesser vasoconstriction of the output or efferent arteriole.

GFR is equal to the renal clearance ratio when any solute is freely filtered and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidneys. The rate therefore measured is the quantity of the substance in the urine that originated from a calculable volume of blood. Relating this principle to the below equation – for the substance used, the product of urine concentration and urine flow equals the mass of substance excreted during the time that urine has been collected. This mass equals the mass filtered at the glomerulus as nothing is added or removed in the nephron. Dividing this mass by the plasma concentration gives the volume of plasma which the mass must have originally come from, and thus the volume of plasma fluid that has entered Bowman&#x27;s capsule within the aforementioned period of time. The GFR is typically recorded in units of &quot;volume per time&quot;, e.g., milliliters per minute (mL/min). Compare to filtration fraction.

:formula_1

There are several different techniques used to calculate or estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR or eGFR). The above formula only applies for GFR calculation when it is equal to the clearance rate.

The normal range of GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is 100–130 average 125 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) in men and 90–120 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) in women younger than the age of 40. In children, GFR measured by inulin clearance is 110 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) until 2 years of age in both sexes, and then it progressively decreases. After age 40, GFR decreases progressively with age, by 0.4–1.2 mL/min per year.

Estimated GFR (eGFR) is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines and regulatory agencies for routine evaluation of GFR whereas measured GFR (mGFR) is recommended as a confirmatory test when more accurate assessment is required.

==Medical imaging==
The kidney function can also be assessed with medical imaging. Some forms of imaging, such as kidney ultrasound or CT scans, may assess kidney function by indicating chronic disease that can impact function, by showing a small or shrivelled kidney.. Other tests, such as nuclear medicine tests, directly assess the function of the kidney by measuring the perfusion and excretion of radioactive substances through the kidneys.

==Kidney function in disease==
A decreased renal function can be caused by many types of kidney disease. Upon presentation of decreased renal function, it is recommended to perform a history and physical examination, as well as performing a renal ultrasound and a urinalysis. The most relevant items in the history are medications, edema, nocturia, gross hematuria, family history of kidney disease, diabetes and polyuria. The most important items in a physical examination are signs of vasculitis, lupus erythematosus, diabetes, endocarditis and hypertension.

A urinalysis is helpful even when not showing any pathology, as this finding suggests an extrarenal etiology. Proteinuria and/or urinary sediment usually indicates the presence of glomerular disease. Hematuria may be caused by glomerular disease or by a disease along the urinary tract.

The most relevant assessments in a renal ultrasound are renal sizes, echogenicity and any signs of hydronephrosis. Renal enlargement usually indicates diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis or myeloma. Renal atrophy suggests longstanding chronic renal disease.

===Chronic kidney disease stages===

Risk factors for kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, family history, older age, ethnic group and smoking.
For most patients, a GFR over 60 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) is adequate. But significant decline of the GFR from a previous test result can be an early indicator of kidney disease requiring medical intervention. The sooner kidney dysfunction is diagnosed and treated the greater odds of preserving remaining nephrons, and preventing the need for dialysis.
The severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is described by six stages; the most severe three are defined by the MDRD-eGFR value, and first three also depend on whether there is other evidence of kidney disease (e.g., proteinuria):
:0) Normal kidney function – GFR above 90 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) and no proteinuria
:1) CKD1 – GFR above 90 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) with evidence of kidney damage
:2) CKD2 (mild) – GFR of 60 to 89 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) with evidence of kidney damage
:3) CKD3 (moderate) – GFR of 30 to 59 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2)
:4) CKD4 (severe) – GFR of 15 to 29 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2)
:5) CKD5 kidney failure – GFR less than 15 (mL/min)/(1.73 m2) Some people add CKD5D for those stage 5 patients requiring dialysis; many patients in CKD5 are not yet on dialysis.

Note: others add a &quot;T&quot; to patients who have had a transplant regardless of stage.

Not all clinicians agree with the above classification, suggesting that it may mislabel patients with mildly reduced kidney function, especially the elderly, as having a disease. A conference was held in 2009 regarding these controversies by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) on CKD: Definition, Classification and Prognosis, gathering data on CKD prognosis to refine the definition and staging of CKD.

<doc id="623158" wikidata="Q565453" url="?curid=623158" title="Rhein Fire (NFL Europe)">
<text>The Rhein Fire were a professional football team in the NFL Europe, formerly the World League of American Football. Established in Düsseldorf, Germany in 1995, the franchise resurrected the name of the former Birmingham Fire team which was active during the 1991–1992 WLAF seasons.

==History==
The team was based in Düsseldorf (and early on the team was occasionally referred to in the U.S. as the Düsseldorf Fire), playing at the Rheinstadion until 2002. After the demolition of the Rheinstadion, the team moved to nearby Gelsenkirchen and played at Arena AufSchalke for the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The team returned to Düsseldorf for the 2005 season, playing at the newly constructed LTU Arena. The Fire would remain at the LTU Arena until NFL Europe&#x27;s dissolution in 2007.

The Fire hosted the World Bowl a record five times: in 1999 and 2002 at the Rheinstadion, in 2004 at Arena AufSchalke, and in 2005 and 2006 at the LTU Arena.

The Fire were one of NFL Europe&#x27;s most successful teams in terms of fan support and on-field success. The team itself played for five World Bowl championships throughout its history, winning in 1998 over the Frankfurt Galaxy and 2000 over the Scottish Claymores. They lost to the Barcelona Dragons in 1997, the Berlin Thunder in 2002, and the Galaxy in 2003.

<text>Raymond Reardon (8 October 1932 – 19 July 2024) was a Welsh professional snooker player who dominated the sport in the 1970s, winning the World Snooker Championship six times and claiming more than a dozen other professional titles. Due to his dark widow&#x27;s peak and prominent eye teeth, he was nicknamed &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Until his mid-thirties, Reardon worked as a coal miner and then as a police officer while pursuing snooker at an amateur level. His titles during this era included six consecutive Welsh Amateur Championships from 1950 to 1955 and the English Amateur Championship in 1964. He turned professional in 1967 and became World Champion in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1978; he was also runner-up in 1982. His other major tournament wins included the inaugural &quot;Pot Black&quot; tournament in 1969, the 1976 Masters, and the 1982 Professional Players Tournament. The first player to be ranked &quot;world number one&quot; when world rankings were introduced during the 1976–77 season, he held the position for the next five years. He regained the top ranking position in 1982, after which his form declined; he dropped out of the elite top-16 ranked players after the 1986–87 season.

In 1978, Reardon became the oldest world snooker champion, aged 45 years and 203 days, a record that he held until the 2022 event, when Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won his seventh world title at the age of 46 years and 148 days. Reardon remains the oldest player to win a ranking event, which he accomplished in 1982, aged 50 years and 14 days. He retired from professional competition in 1991, aged 58, never having achieved a maximum break in tournament play; his highest in competition was 146. During his retirement, Reardon was president of Churston Ferrers golf club in Devon, where he was a member for over 40 years. He mentored O&#x27;Sullivan in preparation for his 2004 World Championship campaign, helping him lift his second world title. Appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1985, he died from cancer in July 2024, aged 91.

==Early life==
The son of Ben and Cynthia Reardon, he was born on 8 October 1932 in the coal mining community of Tredegar in Monmouthshire, Wales. When eight years old, he was introduced to a version of snooker by his uncle, and at ten he was practising cue sports twice-weekly at Tredegar Workmen&#x27;s Institute as well as on a scaled-down billiard table at home. He primarily played English billiards rather than snooker, which, according to authors Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby, helped improve his control of the and his . At the age of 14, following in the footsteps of his father, Reardon turned down a place at a grammar school to become a miner at Ty Trist Colliery. He wore white gloves while mining, to protect his hands for snooker. He made his first century break on his 17th birthday.

In March 1959, Reardon married Sue, a pottery painter. After a rockfall in which he was buried for three hours, and with Sue&#x27;s encouragement, he quit mining and became a police officer in 1960 when his family moved to Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. While serving in the police force, Reardon earned commendations for bravery. On one occasion, he disarmed a man who was wielding a shotgun. On another, he crawled across an icy rooftop and dropped through a skylight onto a burglar.

==Amateur snooker career==
In 1949, Reardon won the &quot;News of the World&quot; Amateur title and was awarded an ash cue stick, presented to him by 15-time world snooker champion, Joe Davis. Reardon used this cue for almost 30 years until it came apart shortly after the 1978 World Championship final. He reached the final of the 1949–50 under-19 Junior championship, losing 2–3 to Jack Carney. Reardon first won the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1950, defeating the defending champion John Ford 5–3 in the final, and he retained the title every year until 1955. He reached the final of the 1956 English Amateur Championship, where he led Tommy Gordon 7–3 after the first day, but lost the from his cue early on the second day and was defeated 9–11.

Reardon played a fellow Tredegar resident, Cliff Wilson, in a succession of and faced him several times in amateur tournaments. Their contests attracted hundreds of spectators and in his 1979 book, &quot;The Story of Billiards and Snooker&quot;, Clive Everton describes them as &quot;modern snooker&#x27;s nearest equivalent to a bare knuckle prize fight.&quot;

After losing in the first round of the 1957 English Amateur Championship, Reardon decided to take some time out from competitive snooker to work on improving his game. He next entered the championship in 1964, when he won the title by defeating John Spencer 11–8 in the final.

==Professional career==

===Six times world snooker champion===
That victory in 1964 led to an invitation to tour South Africa with Jonathan Barron, which proved so successful that Reardon was offered the opportunity to return and tour again as a professional. He returned there after having resigned from the police force and turned professional in 1967. When he played Jimmy van Rensberg in the South African Challenge, Reardon won the best-of-three matches event 2–1.

Reardon&#x27;s first appearance at the World Snooker Championship was in 1969 in a quarter-final against Fred Davis in Stoke-on-Trent. The match featured lengthy tactical exchanges between the players, resulting in some of the longest sessions ever recorded in World Championship play. Neither player was ahead by more than two until Reardon won the 27th frame to lead 15–12, after which Davis won six frames in a row. The best-of-49-frames match went to a , which Davis won. In July 1969, the BBC began broadcasting &quot;Pot Black&quot;, a competition of one-frame matches which became popular with viewers and enhanced the profile and earning power of the participants. Reardon won the first series by defeating Spencer 88–29 in the one-frame final.

In London in April 1970, Reardon won the World Championship for the first time, defeating Davis in the quarter-finals, Spencer in the semi-finals, and John Pulman 37–33 in the final, having led 27–14 before Pulman reduced the lead to one frame at 34–33. At the next World Championship, played in Australia in November 1970, Reardon won all four of his round-robin group matches, and qualified for a place in the semi-finals, where Spencer established a winning margin against him at 25–7 and finished the match 34–15 ahead after . Reardon won the October 1971 edition of the Park Drive 2000, defeating Spencer 4–3 in the final after placing second in the round-robin stage (behind Spencer who had placed first). In the Spring 1972 edition, he made a break of 146 in the round-robin, which was the highest-ever break in competitive play at that time. This remained the highest official break of Reardon&#x27;s career, as he never achieved a maximum break of 147 in tournament play.

At the 1972 World Championship, Reardon lost his first match 22–25 to Rex Williams in the quarter-finals. He reached the final of the 1973 World Championship in Manchester, beating Jim Meadowcroft 16–10, and Spencer 23–22. He lost the first seven frames of the final to Eddie Charlton, but took 17 of the next 23 to hold a four-frame advantage at 17–13 and then moved further ahead into a 27–25 lead. At this point in the match, he complained to the organisers about the television lighting reflecting on the ; when his complaint was not resolved by the organisers, he approached the tournament sponsors and threatened to withdraw from the competition, after which the lighting was changed. Reardon was ahead 31–29 going into the last day, and won 38–32 to claim his second world title.

Reardon defended his World Championship title in 1974, defeating Meadowcroft 15–3, Marcus Owen 15–11 and Davis 15–3 before beating Graham Miles 22–12 in the final. In a post-match interview, Reardon suggested that he had not played &quot;any better than mediocre&quot; in the final, but that Miles had not created any pressure for him, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel the elation that I felt at winning last year.&quot; He also won the 1974 Pontins Professional, leading 9–4 in the final and winning it 10–9 after Spencer took five consecutive frames to force a decider.

In 1975, Reardon reached the final of the inaugural Masters by winning 5–4 on the against Williams in the semi-final, but lost the final 8–9 to Spencer on a . At the 1975 World Championship in Australia, he won a tough quarter-final against Spencer, 19–17, and then eliminated Alex Higgins 19–14 in the semi-finals to meet Charlton in the final. Reardon was leading 16–8, but Charlton won the following nine frames and then went ahead 28–23 before Reardon pulled back seven of the next eight frames to lead 30–29. Charlton took the 60th frame to tie the match but Reardon won the vital 61st frame to secure the world title for the third successive year. A week later, at Pontins in Prestatyn, Wales, he retained the Professional title and won the Spring Open title.

Reardon won the Masters in January 1976, beating Miles 7–3 in the final. He had earned his place in the final by defeating Pulman 4–1 in the quarter-finals, in a match where the highest break (compiled by Pulman) was only 22, and then Charlton 5–4 in the semi-finals.

In 1976, Reardon won his fifth world title, defeating John Dunning 15–7, Dennis Taylor 15–2 and Perrie Mans 20–10. During the final in Manchester against Higgins, Reardon complained about the television lighting (which was changed), the quality of the table (to which adjustments were subsequently made), and the referee (who was replaced). Higgins led in the early stages of the match, but Reardon recovered to 15–13 before winning 12 of the next 15 frames for a 27–16 victory. He claimed the Pontins Professional title for the third consecutive year, defeating Fred Davis 10–9 in a contest described by &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; correspondent as the best match of the professional season for &quot;quality, interest and excitement&quot;. Both players made a century break in the match, Reardon pulling ahead to 8–5 after losing all of the first three frames, but then needing the last two when Davis took the score to 9–8. Reardon also won the 1976 World Professional Match-play Championship in Australia, defeating the event&#x27;s promoter Charlton 31–24 in the final.

Reardon reached the final of the 1977 Masters, beating Williams 4–1 in the quarter-finals and Miles 5–2 in the semi-finals, but lost the final 6–7 to Doug Mountjoy. He was also runner-up at the 1977 Benson &amp; Hedges Ireland Tournament, losing 2–5 to Higgins. Reardon&#x27;s successful run at the World Championship ended in 1977 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, when he lost to Spencer in the quarter-finals 6–13; it was his first defeat at the World Championship since his quarter-final loss to Williams in 1972.

Reardon regained the world title in 1978 in Sheffield; after recovering from 2–7 down to beat Mountjoy 13–9 in the last-16 round, he defeated Bill Werbeniuk 13–6, Charlton 18–14, and Mans 25–18 in the final to lift the trophy for the sixth and final time. Aged 45 years and 203 days, Reardon was the oldest winner of the World Snooker Championship, a record that lasted until 2022 when Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won the title aged 46 years and 148 days. Soon after establishing this record, Reardon regained the Pontins Professional title, taking it for the fourth time in five years, defeating Spencer 7–2 in the final. The same year, his old rival from Tredegar, Wilson, won the World Amateur Championship.

=== Later professional career ===
Toward the end of 1978, Reardon beat Patsy Fagan 6–1 and Higgins 11–9 to win the one-off &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; event, sponsored by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and held at the Wembley Conference Centre. He also won the 1979 Forward Chemicals Tournament.

Reardon regained his &quot;Pot Black&quot; title in 1979 by defeating Mountjoy 2–1 in the final. This was Reardon&#x27;s first win since he won the inaugural event in 1969, although he was runner-up in 1970, 1972 and 1980. At the 1979 World Championship, he lost to Dennis Taylor in the quarter-finals, and was eliminated by David Taylor at the same stage in 1980. He progressed one stage further in 1981, beating Spencer 13–11 and Werbeniuk 13–10 before being defeated by Mountjoy in the semi-finals. Mountjoy scored a championship record break of 145 during the match, which he won 16–10.

In 1979, Reardon joined with Mountjoy and the reigning World Champion, Terry Griffiths, to win the first World Challenge Cup for Wales, defeating England (Fred Davis, Spencer and Miles) in the final, 14–3. The same Wales team retained the title in 1980.

At the 1982 Highland Masters, Reardon eliminated Steve Davis in the semi-finals before winning the event by defeating Spencer 11–4 in the final.He reached the final of the 1982 World Championship, losing to Higgins 15–18. En route to the final, he defeated Jim Donnelly 10–5, John Virgo 13–8, Silvino Francisco 13–8, and Charlton, in the semi-finals, by 16–11 after winning five successive frames from 11-all. In the final, Reardon built a 5–3 lead, but was behind 7–10 at the end of the first day. He later levelled the match at 15–15, but Higgins won the last three frames to claim the title.

For the 1982–83 season, Reardon returned to number one in the world rankings, which at the time was only based on performances at the World Championships over previous years. He won the Professional Players Tournament in late 1982, beating Jimmy White 10–5 in the final, reached the final of the Benson &amp; Hedges Masters, losing 7–9 to Cliff Thorburn, and won the 1983 International Masters, where he defeated Davis 2–1 in the semi-final group stages, before prevailing 9–6 against White in the final, having trailed 3–5. At the Professional Players Tournament, Reardon set a record as the oldest winner of a ranking tournament at the age of 50 years and 14 days. He also regained the Welsh Professional Title, eliminating Griffiths 9–4 and Mountjoy 9–1 in the semi-final and final respectively. At the 1983 World Championship, he lost 12–13 in the second round to Tony Knowles; he reached the quarter-finals in 1984 but was eliminated 2–13 by Kirk Stevens.

Reardon first wore spectacles in a match at the 1985 British Open, which he lost 4–5 to Dave Martin after leading 4–1. He reached the semi-finals of the 1985 World Championship (playing with unassisted vision), where he lost 5–16 to Davis. He lost to John Campbell in the first round of the 1986 World Championship, and to Davis in the second round in 1987.

After dropping out of the top-16 rankings in 1987, Reardon whitewashed Davis 5–0 in the third round of the 1988 British Open, using his old cue (encouraged to rebuild it by Davis) with which he had won his world titles. In the next round, playing under TV lighting, he suffered a drying of contact lenses (which he started using in 1987) and lost 2–5 to David Roe, having led 2–1.

In 1985, Reardon left his wife Sue, with whom he had two children, to live with Carol Covington. He told reporters from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Sue had been &quot;fully informed&quot; of his eight-year affair with Covington. The Reardons divorced in December 1986, and Reardon married Covington in June 1987.

==Retirement, death and legacy==
Reardon played his last competitive ranking match in the second round of qualifying for the 1991 World Championship, where he was defeated 5–10 by Jason Prince, losing three frames on the final black. Afterwards, Reardon said that he felt &quot;no bitterness&quot; but that he would not be returning. Aged 58 and having slipped to 127th in the provisional rankings, Reardon halted his playing career, mentioning that he had not entered any tournaments for the following season because the qualifying event dates clashed with his exhibition commitments on the holiday camp circuit, but adding that &quot;even if it were feasible, [he] wouldn&#x27;t play&quot; except in invitation or seniors events. He later played in the 2000 World Seniors Masters where he lost his opening one-frame match 46–69 to Miles. He advised Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan on the way to his 2004 World Championship victory, giving him psychological and tactical help.

When the snooker world rankings were introduced in 1976, Reardon was the first to claim the position of world number one, retaining it until 1981. His win in the 1982 Professional Players Tournament at 50 contributed to his recapturing the world number one position in the first set of rankings to be calculated on tournaments other than the World Championship. Reardon and Spencer were the first players to exploit the commercial opportunities made available by the increasing interest in snooker in the early 1970s. After winning &quot;Pot Black&quot; in 1969 and the world title in 1970, Reardon took up offers for exhibition matches and holiday camp exhibition engagements. Everton and Gordon Burn (1986) have both noted that his peak as a player pre-dated the real boom in snooker that happened in the 1980s.

In January 1976, Reardon was the subject of an episode of the British TV show, &quot;This is Your Life&quot;, the guests including Spencer, Charlton, Higgins, Pulman, Miles, Thorburn, Jackie Rea and Joyce Gardner. Later that year, he was a guest on &quot;The David Nixon Show&quot;, and in 1979 he was a guest on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, and &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;. His later guest appearances included &quot;Punchlines&quot; (1981), &quot;Saturday Superstore&quot; (1984), &quot;The Rod and Emu Show&quot; (1984), &quot;Sorry!&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Little and Large Show&quot; (1987). He appeared on the snooker-themed game show &quot;Big Break&quot; several times. Ian Wooldridge wrote and presented a &quot;Ray Reardon&quot; special on BBC2 in 1984, and the same channel broadcast &quot;Ray Reardon at 80&quot; in 2012. Reardon was a castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1979, and chose a set of golf clubs and balls as his luxury item.

His prominent eye teeth and widow&#x27;s peak led to him being nicknamed &quot;Dracula&quot;; the sobriquet was first used by Paul Daniels after Reardon appeared on one of his television shows. Everton has described Reardon in his early career as a &quot;deadly long potter&quot;, and praised his &quot;nerve with which he identifies and seizes frame winning openings.&quot; Jack Karnehm wrote that Reardon achieved &quot;complete and utter dominance of the game&quot; by 1976, and &quot;had a determination and will to win unequalled since the heyday of Joe Davis.&quot; Williams and Gadsby described Reardon as &quot;without doubt the most successful snooker player of the 1970s&quot;, and claimed &quot;he set new standards for mental fortitude&quot; in the game.

After seeing Reardon play at Pontins in 1975, Steve Davis incorporated elements that he had observed in Reardon&#x27;s game into his own, including a pause before hitting the cue ball, and his &quot;approach&quot; to the shot. Burn wrote &quot;Ray Reardon behaved as if he thought he was special. And Stevewith a little encouragement from [his manager] Barry [Hearn]decided that was how he was going to behave from now on.&quot; Davis admitted that he had lost some respect for Reardon when, as a new professional, he experienced Reardon asking for the pack of to be six times, claiming that the referee had not placed them correctly. Unsettled by what he felt was gamesmanship on Reardon&#x27;s part, Davis had lost the match 0–4. Spencer stated in his autobiography that he was never friendly with Reardon, and suggested that he was &quot;the sort of person who could laugh 24 hours a day if it was to his advantage&quot;.

Reardon was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1985 Birthday Honours for services to snooker. He resided in Devon, and was the president of the golf club in Churston, a position that he had held since 2001, having been a member since the 1970s. He made a playing appearance at a Snooker Legends evening in Plymouth in July 2010. The Welsh Open trophy was renamed the &quot;Ray Reardon Trophy&quot; in his honour, starting with the 2017 edition of the tournament.

Reardon died of cancer on 19 July 2024, at the age of 91. Three-time world champion Mark Williams led tributes to his fellow Welshman, describing Reardon as &quot;one of the best sportspeople ever from Wales and the best snooker player.&quot;

<doc id="623166" wikidata="Q20117" url="?curid=623166" title="Dihydrogen monoxide parody">
<text>The dihydrogen monoxide parody is a parody that involves referring to water by its unfamiliar chemical systematic name &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; (DHMO, or the chemical formula H2O) and describing some properties of water in a particularly concerning manner — such as the ability to accelerate corrosion (rust) and cause suffocation (drowning) — for the purpose of encouraging alarmism among the audience to often incite a moral panic calling for water to be banned, regulated strictly or labeled as a hazardous chemical. The parody has also involved other uncommon chemical nomenclatures for water such as &quot;hydrogen hydroxide&quot;, &quot;dihydrogen oxide&quot; and &quot;hydric acid&quot;, used in many prank shows to scare people into thinking that it is a lethal or corrosive substance.

The motivation behind the parody is to play into chemophobia, and to demonstrate how exaggerated analysis, information overload and a lack of scientific literacy can lead to misplaced fears.

==History==
In 1983 on April Fools&#x27; Day, an edition of the &quot;Durand Express&quot;, a weekly newspaper in Durand, Michigan, reported that &quot;dihydrogen oxide&quot; had been found in the city&#x27;s water pipes, and warned that it was fatal if inhaled, and could produce blistering vapors.

The first appearance of the parody as &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; on the Internet was attributed to the &quot;Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide&quot;, a parody organization at the University of California, Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and newsgroup discussions in 1990. This new version of the parody was created by housemates while attending UC Santa Cruz, in 1990, revised by Craig Jackson in 1994, and was published in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; in March 1996. It received widespread public attention in 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban &quot;DHMO&quot; as the basis of his science project, titled &quot;How Gullible Are We?&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s original site included the following warning:

A mock material safety data sheet has also been created for DHMO.

== Molecular terminology and naming conventions ==
The water molecule has the chemical formula , meaning the molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Literally, the term &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; means &quot;two hydrogen, one oxygen&quot;: the prefix &quot;&quot; in &quot;dihydrogen&quot; means &quot;two&quot;, the prefix &quot;&quot; in &quot;monoxide&quot; means &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;oxide&quot; designates oxygen in a compound (the consecutive o&#x27;s that would occur in &quot;monooxide&quot; are combined into one).

Using chemical nomenclature, other names for water include: &quot;hydrogen oxide&quot;; &quot;hydrogen hydroxide&quot;, which characterises it as a base; and several designating it as an acid, such as &quot;hydric acid&quot; or &quot;hydroxyl acid&quot;. The term used in the original text, &quot;hydroxyl acid&quot;, is a non-standard name.

Under the 2005 revisions of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry, there is no single correct name for every compound. The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers, unambiguously, to a single substance. It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name, although the number of acceptable names is limited. &quot;Water&quot; is one acceptable name for this compound, even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound (its liquid form). The other IUPAC recommendation is &quot;oxidane.&quot;

==Public use==
* In 1989–1990, several students circulated a dihydrogen monoxide contamination warning on the University of California, Santa Cruz, campus via photocopied fliers.
* In 1994, Craig Jackson created a web page for the Coalition to Ban DHMO.
* The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by Dan Curtis Johnson, partly as a foil on the Coalition page, claiming to oppose its &quot;subversive agenda&quot;. The site points out that hydrogen hydroxide is &quot;environmentally safe&quot; and &quot;enhances the functionality, growth, and health of many forms of life&quot;.
* In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in Idaho Falls, Idaho, gathered 43 votes to ban the chemical, out of 50 ninth-graders surveyed. Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls Science Fair for analysis of the results of his survey. In recognition of his experiment, journalist James K. Glassman coined the term &quot;&quot; to refer to &quot;the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion&quot;.
* In late 1997, drawing inspiration from Jackson&#x27;s web page and Zohner&#x27;s research, Tom Way created a website at DHMO.org, including links to some legitimate sites such as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Institutes of Health.
* On April 1, 1998 (April Fools&#x27; Day), a member of the Australian Parliament announced a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide internationally.
* In , a staffer in New Zealand Green Party MP Sue Kedgley&#x27;s office responded to a request for support for a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide by saying she was &quot;absolutely supportive of the campaign to ban this toxic substance&quot;. This was criticized in a press release by the National Party, one of whose MPs fell for the very same joke six years later.
* In 2002, radio talk show host Neal Boortz mentioned on the air that the Atlanta water system had been checked and found to be contaminated with dihydrogen monoxide, and set about relating the hazards associated with that &quot;dangerous&quot; chemical. A local TV station even covered the &#x27;scandal&#x27;. A spokesperson for the city&#x27;s water system told the reporter that there was no more dihydrogen monoxide in the system than what was allowed under the law.
* The idea was used for a segment of an episode of the Penn &amp; Teller documentary show &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, in which actress Kris McGaha and a camera crew gathered signatures from people considering themselves &quot;concerned environmentalists&quot; to sign a petition to ban DHMO.
* In March 2004, Aliso Viejo, California, almost considered banning the use of foam containers at city-sponsored events because dihydrogen monoxide is part of their production. A paralegal had asked the city council to put it on the agenda; he later attributed it to poor research. The bill was pulled from the agenda before it could come to a vote, but not before the city received a raft of bad publicity.
* In 2006, in Louisville, Kentucky, David Karem, executive director of the Waterfront Development Corporation, a public body that operates Waterfront Park, wished to deter bathers from using a large public fountain. &quot;Counting on a lack of understanding about water&#x27;s chemical makeup&quot;, he arranged for signs reading: to be posted on the fountain at public expense. 
* In 2007, Jacqui Dean, New Zealand National Party MP, fell for the joke, writing a letter to Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton asking &quot;Does the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs have a view on the banning of this drug?&quot;
* On April 1, 2009, then-Canadian Member of Parliament, Andrew Scheer (who was later elected leader of the Conservative Party), used the DHMO parody as the basis for an April Fool&#x27;s Day &quot;media release&quot; on his website, in which he claimed to have presented a bill to ban the substance from all federal government buildings.
* In February 2011, during the campaign of the Finnish parliamentary election, a voting advice application asked the candidates whether the availability of &quot;hydric acid, also known as dihydrogen monoxide&quot; should be restricted. 49% of the candidates answered in favor of the restriction.
* In April 2013, as part of an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, two radio personalities at Gator Country 101.9, a station in Lee County, Florida, were suspended for a few days after telling listeners that dihydrogen monoxide was coming out of their water taps. The prank resulted in several calls by consumers to the local utility company, necessitating that the company send out a press release stating that the water was safe.

<text>The National Library of South Africa is the agency of the government of South Africa which maintains a national library of all published materials relating to the country.

==History==
In 1818, Lord Charles Somerset, the Cape Colony&#x27;s first civil Governor, issued a proclamation to control the wine trade, imposing a tax on wine brought into Cape Town for sale. The net proceeds would be used to form a Public Library which should &quot;lay the foundation of a system, which shall place the means of knowledge within reach of the youth of this remote corner of the Globe,&quot; (presuming a globe hath corners) &quot;and bring within their reach what the most eloquent of ancient writers has considered to be one of the first blessings of life, &#x27;Home Education&#x27;.&quot; Since that time, South Africa&#x27;s library development was bifurcated although the library in Cape Town was the original establishment. The most likely model for Cape Town&#x27;s &quot;Public Library&quot; was the London Institution (established in 1805 in the style of an Athenaeum).

The Library&#x27;s first significant acquisition was the collection of , who bequeathed his books to the Dutch Reformed Church in 1761 to serve as the foundation of a public library. In 1820 the board of trustees decided to donate the Dessinian Collection to the new library. Other notable donations followed over the years, among others Sir George Grey who when he left South Africa in 1861 presented the Library with his remarkable personal collection of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and rare books. In 1873 the South African Public Library became a legal deposit library for the Cape Colony, and from 1916 it received all printed items published throughout the country. The Library continued as a legal deposit library until 1954, when this function was taken over by the City of Cape Town. From then on it began to develop its unique character as a national reference library devoted to research based on its extensive stock, with a concurrent name change in 1967 to the South African Library.

Diplomat Edmund Roberts visited the library, then called the South African Library around 1833 and described it as &quot;once the pride and boast of the colony.&quot; He noted that the library had approximately 10,000 volumes and called it a &quot;highly creditable place.&quot;

===The State Library===
The came into being thanks to a donation of books from the Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde. These books consisted of a complete library of Dutch works, mainly Dutch literature and language, to the Transvaal Republic&#x27;s government. The first consignment of eight chests of books arrived in 1883, including a chest from the Dutch Bible Society. On 21 September 1887 the Transvaal government approved the constitution of the Staats-Bibliotheek. As Pretoria began to grow in size, there arose a need for a public library. The State Library functioned as both a public and national library, from  the early 1890’s to 1964. The State Library ultimately took the responsibility of legal deposit too. These two libraries merged in November of 1999 and became the National Library of South Africa.

The first Pretoria Public Library had opened its doors in 1878, but because of ongoing financial problems was closed down in 1890. In 1893 strong public support and a collection of 700 saw another public library arise, this time under the wing of the Staats-Bibliotheek and with the bookstock of the former Public Library. From that time onward until 1964, the State Library performed a dual role as public library and national library. The first national librarian, the Afrikaans poet Jan Celliers, saw exchange agreements as a means of enriching the State Library&#x27;s collections. The first exchange agreement was entered into in 1898 with the Smithsonian Institution of Washington in the United States. In terms of the agreement the State Library would receive all American official publications in exchange for two copies of each official publication of the South African republic. From the early thirties under the guidance of the visionary national librarian Matthew Stirling, the State Library began to develop the character of a central library for South Africa, taking on functions such as striving for a national library lending system and a centre for bibliographical information.

==Modern consolidation==

Until 1 November 1999, for historical reasons, South Africa had two national libraries, the South African Library, founded in 1818, in Cape Town, and the State Library, founded in 1887, in Pretoria. In terms of South African legal deposit legislation, each of the national libraries was a legal deposit library, entitled to receive from the publishers a gratis copy of every book, serial, newspaper, government publication or other printed item published in South Africa. In South Africa legal deposit, in some form or another, dates back to 1842. As a result, extensive collections of material of great scholarly value have been built up in the former national libraries. During the 1990s the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology began a review of all legislation under its jurisdiction, including the National Libraries Act, No 56 of 1985. The Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in 1996 appointed a Working Group on the National Libraries of South Africa to advise him on the future of the two national libraries. The most important recommendation of the Working Group was that the two national libraries be amalgamated to form a dual-site (Cape Town and Pretoria) national library, to be known as the National Library of South Africa.

===Creation under the National Library Act===

The National Library of South Africa&#x27;s core national library functions are described in Section 4 subsection 1 of the National Library Act, No 92 of 1998, and cover the following broad areas:

* to build up a complete collection of published documents emanating from or relating to South Africa; 
* to maintain and extend any other collections of published and unpublished documents with the emphasis on documents emanating from or relating to Southern Africa; 
* to promote the optimal management of collections of published documents held in South African libraries as a national resource; and to render a national bibliographic service and to act as the national bibliographic agency; 
* to promote optimal access to published documents, nationally and internationally; 
* to provide reference and information services, nationally and internationally; 
* to act as the national preservation library and to provide conservation services on a national basis; 
* to promote awareness and appreciation of the national published documentary heritage; and 
* to promote information awareness and information literacy.

<doc id="623174" wikidata="Q412310" url="?curid=623174" title="Von Willebrand factor">
<text>Von Willebrand factor (VWF) () is a blood glycoprotein that promotes primary hemostasis, specifically, platelet adhesion. It is deficient and/or defective in von Willebrand disease and is involved in many other diseases, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Heyde&#x27;s syndrome, and possibly hemolytic–uremic syndrome. Increased plasma levels in many cardiovascular, neoplastic, metabolic (e.g. diabetes), and connective tissue diseases are presumed to arise from adverse changes to the endothelium, and may predict an increased risk of thrombosis.

== Biochemistry ==

=== Synthesis ===
VWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein present in blood plasma and produced constitutively as ultra-large VWF in endothelium (in the Weibel–Palade bodies) and megakaryocytes (α-granules of platelets).

=== Structure ===
VWF is synthesized as a prepropeptide comprising 2813 amino acids in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. The prepropeptide includes a 22-amino acid signal peptide (SP), a 741-amino acid propeptide (VWFpp), and a 2050-amino acid mature VWF monomer. The signal peptide directs the prepropeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is cleaved, resulting in the formation of pro-VWF. Pro-VWF undergoes glycosylation, forms disulfide bonds, and dimerizes under neutral pH and the influence of Protein Disulfide Isomerase A1 (PDIA1).

Dimerized pro-VWF is then transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it forms &quot;dimeric bouquets&quot; and undergoes further glycosylation. The propeptide is cleaved by furin, but remains associated with the mature VWF in a non-covalent manner. This association persists until the propeptide dissociates, yielding mature VWF monomers, which subsequently dimerize and multimerize. Although the fundamental structure of mature VWF is monomeric, the smallest form detectable in blood plasma is a VWF dimer.

The basic monomer of VWF, a 2050-amino acid protein, contains several key domains with specific functions:

* The D&#x27;/D3 domain: Binds to factor VIII, heparin, and P-selectin.
* The A1 domain: Binds to the platelet GPIb-receptor, collagen types IV and VI, heparin, and osteoprotegerin.
* The A2 domain: Unfolds to expose the cleavage site for ADAMTS13 protease, which cleaves VWF into smaller multimers. Unfolding is influenced by blood shear flow, calcium binding, and a &quot;vicinal disulfide&quot; at the A2-domain’s C-terminus.
* The A3 domain: Acts as the primary collagen binding site for VWF, binding to collagen types I and III.
* The C4 domain: Contains an RGD motif that binds to platelet integrin αIIbβ3.
* The CK (cystine knot) domain at the protein’s C-terminal end: Involved in VWF dimerization.

VWF is one of the few proteins carrying ABO blood group antigens. After glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, VWF is packaged into storage granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) in endothelial cells, and α-granules in platelets.
=== Function ===

Von Willebrand Factor&#x27;s primary function is binding to other proteins, in particular factor VIII, and it is important in platelet adhesion to wound sites. It is not an enzyme and, thus, has no catalytic activity.

VWF binds to a number of cells and molecules. The most important ones are:
* Factor VIII is bound to VWF while inactive in circulation; factor VIII degrades rapidly when not bound to VWF. Factor VIII is released from VWF by the action of thrombin. In the absence of VWF, factor VIII has a half-life of 1–2 hours; when carried by intact VWF, factor VIII has a half-life of 8–12 hours.
* VWF binds to collagen, e.g., when collagen is exposed beneath endothelial cells due to damage occurring to the blood vessel. Endothelium also releases VWF which forms additional links between the platelets&#x27; glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and the collagen fibrils
* VWF binds to platelet GpIb when it forms a complex with gpIX and gpV; this binding occurs under all circumstances, but is most efficient under high shear stress (i.e., rapid blood flow in narrow blood vessels, see below).
* VWF binds to other platelet receptors when they are activated, e.g., by thrombin (i.e., when coagulation has been stimulated).

VWF plays a major role in blood coagulation. Therefore, VWF deficiency or dysfunction (von Willebrand disease) leads to a bleeding tendency, which is most apparent in tissues having high blood flow shear in narrow vessels. From studies it appears that VWF uncoils under these circumstances, decelerating passing platelets. Recent research also suggests that von Willebrand Factor is involved in the formation of blood vessels themselves, which would explain why some people with von Willebrand disease develop vascular malformations (predominantly in the digestive tract) that can bleed excessively.

===Catabolism===
The biological breakdown (catabolism) of VWF is largely mediated by the enzyme ADAMTS13 (acronym of &quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;d&quot;isintegrin-like &quot;a&quot;nd &quot;m&quot;etalloprotease with &quot;t&quot;hrombo&quot;s&quot;pondin type 1 motif no. &quot;13&quot;&quot;). It is a metalloproteinase that cleaves VWF between tyrosine at position 842 and methionine at position 843 (or 1605–1606 of the gene) in the A2 domain. This breaks down the multimers into smaller units, which are degraded by other peptidases.

The half-life of vWF in human plasma is around 16 hours; glycosylation variation on vWF molecules from different individuals result in a larger range of 4.2 to 26 hours. Liver cells as well as macrophages take up vWF for clearance via ASGPRs and LRP1. SIGLEC5 and CLEC4M also recognize vWF.

== Role in disease ==
Hereditary or acquired defects of VWF lead to von Willebrand disease (vWD), a bleeding diathesis of the skin and mucous membranes, causing nosebleeds, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The point at which the mutation occurs determines the severity of the bleeding diathesis. There are three types (I, II and III), and type II is further divided in several subtypes. Treatment depends on the nature of the abnormality and the severity of the symptoms. Most cases of vWD are hereditary, but abnormalities of VWF may be acquired; aortic valve stenosis, for instance, has been linked to vWD type IIA, causing gastrointestinal bleeding - an association known as Heyde&#x27;s syndrome.

In thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or has been inhibited by antibodies directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of VWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.

Higher levels of VWF are more common among people that have had ischemic stroke (from blood-clotting) for the first time. Occurrence is not affected by ADAMTS13, and the only significant genetic factor is the person&#x27;s blood group. High plasma VWF levels were found to be an independent predictor of major bleeding in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients. VWF is a marker of endothelial dysfunction, and is consistently elevated in atrial fibrillation, associated with adverse outcomes.

== History ==

VWF is named after Erik Adolf von Willebrand, a Finnish physician who in 1926 first described a hereditary bleeding disorder in families from Åland. Although von Willebrand did not identify the definite cause, he distinguished von Willebrand disease (vWD) from hemophilia and other forms of bleeding diathesis.

In the 1950s, vWD was shown to be caused by a plasma factor deficiency (instead of being caused by platelet disorders), and, in the 1970s, the VWF protein was purified.
Harvey J. Weiss and coworkers developed a quantitative assay for VWF function that remains a mainstay of laboratory
evaluation for VWD to this day.

== Interactions ==

Von Willebrand Factor has been shown to interact with Collagen, type I, alpha 1.

Recently, It has been reported that the cooperation and interactions within the von Willebrand Factors enhances the adsorption probability in the primary haemostasis. Such cooperation is proven by calculating the adsorption probability of flowing VWF once it crosses another adsorbed one. Such cooperation is held within a wide range of shear rates.

<text>Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov (; 24 April 1908 – 19 December 1954) was a high-level Soviet security official who from 1943 to 1946 was the head of SMERSH in the USSR People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defense, and from 1946 to 1951 of the Minister of State Security or MGB (ex-NKGB). He was removed from office and arrested in 1951 on charges of failing to investigate the Doctors&#x27; Plot. After the death of Joseph Stalin, Abakumov was tried for fabricating the Leningrad Affair, sentenced to death and executed in 1954.

== Early life and career ==

Abakumov was an ethnic Russian. Recent scholarship suggests that he was born in Moscow, though he was previously said to be from the Don Cossack region of south Russia. His father was an unskilled labourer and his mother a nurse.

At the age of 14, Abakumov joined the Soviet Red Army in spring 1922 and served with the 2nd Special Task Moscow Brigade in the Russian Civil War until demobilization in December 1923. He then joined the Komsomol. He became a candidate member of the Communist Party in 1930, and worked in the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Supplies until 1932, while being responsible for the Military Section of the Communist Youth League in the Moscow area (&quot;raion&quot;).

In early 1932, recommended by the Party to join the security services (OGPU), he was assigned to the Economic Department and possibly to the Investigation Department. In 1933, he was dismissed from the Economic Department and assigned as an overseer to the GULAG. This was a clear demotion; Abakumov was a compulsive womanizer, and his superior, M.P. Shreider (ru), regarded Abakumov as unfit to be a Chekist.

== Rise through NKVD ranks ==

In 1934, after the reorganization of the security apparatus (the OGPU was joined to the NKVD as a GUGB), Abakumov started his work in a 1st Section of Economics Department (EKO) by the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) of NKVD. On 1 August 1934, he was transferred to the Chief Directorate of Camps and Labour Colonies (GULAG), where he served until 1937, mainly as an operative officer in the 3rd Section of Security Department of GULAG of the NKVD. In April 1937, Abakumov was moved to the 4th Department (OO) of GUGB of the NKVD where he served until March 1938.

After the next reorganization of NKVD structure in March 1938, he became assistant to the chief of the 4th Department in the 1st Directorate of the NKVD. From 29 September to 1 November 1938, he was an assistant to Pyotr Fedotov, the head of the 2nd Department (Secret Political Dep – or. SPO) of GUGB of the NKVD. Until the end of 1938, he worked in the &quot;SPO&quot; GUGB NKVD as a head of one of the sections. Abakumov survived the Great Purge by participating in it. He executed each order without scruple, probably saving him from facing an execution squad himself. Near the end of December 1938, Abakumov was moved from Moscow to Rostov-on-Don, where he became the head of the UNKVD of the Rostov Oblast (the head of the local NKVD Office).

== World War II activities ==

Abakumov returned to Moscow HQ on 12 February 1941 as a Captain of State Security (he acquired this rank 12.28.1938 bypassing the rank of senior lieutenant of State security) and, after the reorganization and creation of the new NKGB, he became one of the deputies of Lavrentiy Beria, who was the People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs (head of the NKVD). On 19 July 1941, he became the head of newly Directorate of Special Department&#x27;s (&quot;UOO&quot;) of the NKVD which was responsible for Counterintelligence and internal security in the RKKA (Red Army).

In this position, after the attack of Nazi Germany on the Soviet Union and the defeats experienced by the Red Army, on Stalin&#x27;s order he led the purges of RKKA commanders accused of betrayal and cowardice. In 1943, from 19 April to 20 May 1943, Abakumov was one of Stalin&#x27;s deputies, when he held the post of People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence of the USSR.

In April 1943, when military Counterintelligence Main Directorate of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defence of the USSR (or &quot;GUKR&quot; NKO USSR) better known as SMERSH was created, Abakumov was put in charge of it, in the rank of Commissar (2nd rank) of State Security, and held the title of vice-Commissar of Defense.

During the war, he reported directly to Joseph Stalin, and appears to have been able to bypass Beria. For example, Beria disclaimed responsibility for the arrest in 1941 of the Red Army Marshal, Kirill Meretskov, for which he blamed Stalin and Abakumov. However, Nikita Khrushchev – who later denounced Stalin and had both Beria and Abakumov executed – did not believe him. He claimed that Stalin &quot;thought he had found in Abakumov a bright young man who was dutifully carrying out his orders, but actually Abakumov was reporting to Stalin what Beria had told him Stalin wanted to hear&quot;.

He used his position to enrich himself. He took over a &#x27;splendid&#x27; apartment, whose previous occupant, a soprano, he had arrested, and &quot;stashed his mistresses in the Moskva Hotel and imported trainloads of plunder from Berlin.&quot;

== Head of MGB ==

In 1946, Stalin appointed Abakumov Minister of State Security (MGB). Although the ministry was under the general supervision of Beria, Stalin hoped to curb the latter&#x27;s power. Beria was said by Vsevolod Merkulov to be &quot;scared to death of Abakumov&quot; and tried to &quot;have good relations&quot; with him. In his capacity in the MGB he was in charge of the 1949 purge known as the &quot;Leningrad Affair,&quot; in which the Politburo members Nikolai Voznesensky and Aleksei Kuznetsov were executed.

He also carried out the early stages of the anti-semitic campaign that Stalin ordered, as the second pro-Arab phase of Stalin&#x27;s Middle East plans following the enormous military support he had given to help establish the state of Israel, involving the arrest and torture of numerous prominent Jews, including an Old Bolshevik, Solomon Lozovsky.

When the eminent scientist, Lina Stern, was arrested and brought before Abakumov, he shouted at her, accusing her of being a Zionist and of plotting to turn the Crimea in a separate Jewish state. When she denied the accusation, he shouted: &quot;Why you old whore!&quot; Stern replied: &quot;So that&#x27;s the way a minister talks to an academician.&quot;

== Arrest and execution ==

In March 1951, an elderly Jewish doctor, Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger died in custody after being subjected to interrogations lasting up to 12 hours a session by a junior officer, Mikhail Ryumin. Ryumin claimed that Etinger had confessed to murdering the former leader of the Moscow communist party, Aleksandr Shcherbakov, but neither Abakumov nor his deputy, Mikhail Likhachev, believed his story, and Likhachev proposed that Ryumin be disciplined for mishandling the case. Ryumin retaliated by writing to Stalin alleging that Abakumov and Likhachev were covering up Shcherbakov&#x27;s &#x27;murder&#x27;. A Politburo commission backed Ryumin, and ruled that Abakumov had &quot;prevented the Central Committee from exposing the undoubtedly real conspiratorial group of doctors&quot; who were supposedly foreign agents intend on murdering leaders of the communist party. This fabrication became known as the Doctors&#x27; plot.
Abakumov was dismissed on 11 July, and arrested the following day. For three months, he was held in a freezing cell, whilst being interrogated by Ryumin, a vicious torturer. Most of the leading Jewish officers who had worked with Abakumov were dismissed, and several were arrested. Ryumin planned to build a case in which Abakumov and Lev Shvartzman were at the head of a Zionist plot. Shwartzman &#x27;confessed&#x27; not only to being part of a Zionist plot, but to having had homosexual relations with Abakumov, and his son.

In March 1953 Stalin died, Beria regained control of the police, Ryumin was arrested, and the Doctors&#x27; plot was declared to have been a fabrication, but Abakumov and his associates remained in prison. On 2 April, Beria sent a note to the Praesidium of the Central Committee saying that Abakumov had been questioned about the suspicious death of the actor, Solomon Mikhoels, and had confessed that he was murdered on Stalin&#x27;s orders. On 12 May, Beria sent another note, accusing Abakumov of having fabricated the case against Polina Zhemchuzhina, Jewish wife of the Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, who had been arrested as a suspected Zionist in 1948. On 26 May, Beria submitted another memorandum, accusing Abakumov of fabricating the case against the former Minister of Aviation, Aleksey Shakhurin and other leaders of the air force, who were released after seven years in prison.

The case against Abakumov continued after Beria&#x27;s arrest, with the additional detail that he was now accused of being &quot;an accomplice in the crimes of Beria&quot;. The most serious charge against him was that he had been involved in fabricating the charges against Nikolai Voznesensky and other victims of the &#x27;Leningrad affair&#x27;. During a meeting of Leningrad party members, on 6 May 1954, the USSR Procurator General, Roman Rudenko described Abakumov as &quot;a criminal, falsifying criminal cases, an adventurer, ready to commit any crimes for the sake of his careeristic, enemy goals, a bourgeois degenerate.&quot;

Abakumov and five others were brought to a six-day trial in December 1954, accused of falsifying the &#x27;Leningrad Affair&#x27; and other charges. Abakumov and three former deputy heads of the MGB Section for Investigating Specially Important Cases, Aleksandr Leonov, Vladimir Komarov and Mikhail Likhachev, were sentenced to death and shot after the trial ended on 19 December. Two others, Yakov. M. Broverman and I.A. Chernov were sentenced, respectively, to 25 years and 15 years in the GULAG. In 1970, it was reported that Yakov Broverman was enjoying a relatively privileged position as a trustee in a labour camp. He was released in 1976.

==Awards==
Abakumov was deprived of all titles and awards on November 14, 1955.
== In literature and film ==

Abakumov is portrayed as a cunning courtier, not altogether trusted by Stalin, in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s novel, &quot;The First Circle&quot;. In the 1992 film version of the book, he was played by Christopher Plummer and in a Russian language mini-series broadcast in 2006, he was played by Roman Madyanov. There is another fictional portrayal of him in the novel &quot;Dust and Ashes&quot; by Anatoly Rybakov. In Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s famous non-fiction text, The Gulag Archipelago, he accused Abakumov of personally engaging in the beatings and torture of prisoners during interrogations.

<text>The Good Old Naughty Days (, ), released in 2002, is a compilation from over 300 recently discovered film clips from silent hardcore pornographic films made between 1905 and 1930, re-edited by director Michel Reilhac, with a new soundtrack by Eric Le Guen. Most of the films were made in France and were intended to be shown in brothels. The collection also includes a pornographic animation from the United States, &quot;Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure&quot;, made by unknown artists in or around 1928 and never theatrically released before.

Themes covered include pornographic adaptations of classics such as &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, precursors of pornography clichés such as the encounter between the &quot;musketeer&quot; and the milkmaid, stock characters such as lascivious nuns and priests, and footage showing bestiality (sexual acts with non-human animals), which according to the film-maker Michel Reilhac shows that &quot;the modern porn industry did not invent anything – everything had already been filmed by our great-grandparents.&quot;

At the time of its release (2003) it was the first R18 film to be rated for display in cinemas in the United Kingdom for over ten years, despite its contents, partly due to its &#x27;classic&#x27; style and age and as &quot;historical footage&quot;.
