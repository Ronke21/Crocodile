<text>A manual transmission (MT), also known as manual gearbox, standard transmission (in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States), or stick shift (in the United States), is a multi-speed motor vehicle transmission system where gear changes require the driver to manually select the gears by operating a gear stick and clutch (which is usually a foot pedal for cars or a hand lever for motorcycles).

Early automobiles used &quot;sliding-mesh&quot; manual transmissions with up to three forward gear ratios. Since the 1950s, &quot;constant-mesh&quot; manual transmissions have become increasingly commonplace, and the number of forward ratios has increased to 5-speed and 6-speed manual transmissions for current vehicles.

The alternative to a manual transmission is an automatic transmission. Common types of automatic transmissions are the hydraulic automatic transmission (AT) and the continuously variable transmission (CVT). The automated manual transmission (AMT) and dual-clutch transmission (DCT) are internally similar to a conventional manual transmission, but are shifted automatically.

Alternatively, there are semi-automatic transmissions. These systems are based on the design of, and are technically similar to, a conventional manual transmission. They have a gear shifter which requires the driver&#x27;s input to manually change gears, but the driver is not required to engage a clutch pedal before changing gear. Instead, the mechanical linkage for the clutch pedal is replaced by an actuator, servo, or solenoid and sensors, which operate the clutch system automatically when the driver touches or moves the gearshift. This removes the need for a physical clutch pedal.

==Overview==
A manual transmission requires the driver to operate the gear stick and clutch in order to change gears (unlike an automatic transmission or semi-automatic transmission, where one (typically the clutch) or both of these functions are automated). Most manual transmissions for cars allow the driver to select any gear ratio at any time, for example shifting from second to fourth gear, or fifth to third gear. However, sequential manual transmissions, which are commonly used in motorcycles and racing cars, only allow the driver to select the next-higher or next-lower gear.

In a vehicle with a manual transmission, the flywheel is attached to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft, therefore rotating at engine speed. A clutch disc sits between the flywheel and the transmission pressure plate which is attached to the transmission input shaft, controlling whether the transmission is connected to the engine or not. The clutch pedal controls the pressure plate (&quot;clutch engaged&quot; – the clutch pedal is not being pressed) or not connected to the engine (&quot;clutch disengaged&quot; – the clutch pedal is being pressed down). When the engine is running and the clutch is engaged (i.e., clutch pedal up), the flywheel spins the clutch pressure plate and hence the transmission.
The design of most manual transmissions for cars is that gear ratios are selected by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. This is a fundamental difference compared with a typical hydraulic automatic transmission, which uses an epicyclic (planetary) design, and a hydraulic torque converter. An automatic transmission that allows the driver to control the gear selection (such as shift paddles or &quot;+/−&quot; positions on the gear selector) is called a manumatic transmission, and is not considered a manual transmission. Some automatic transmissions are based on the mechanical build and internal design of a manual transmission but have added components (such as computer-controlled actuators and sensors) which automatically control the timing and speed of the gear shifts and clutch; this design is typically called an automated manual transmission (or sometimes a &quot;clutchless manual transmission&quot;).

Contemporary manual transmissions for cars typically use five or six forward gears ratios and one reverse gear, however, transmissions with between two and seven gears have been produced at times. Transmissions for trucks and other heavy equipment often have between eight and twenty-five gears, in order to keep the engine speed within the optimal power band for all typical road speeds. Operating such transmissions often uses the same pattern of shifter movement with a single or multiple switches to engage the next sequence of gears.

== History ==
=== 1890s to 1940s ===
Many of the first automobiles were rear-engined, with a simple belt-drive functioning as a single-speed transmission. The 1891 Panhard et Levassor is considered a significant advance in automotive transmissions since it used a three-speed manual transmission. This transmission, along with many similar designs that it inspired, was a non-synchronous (also called &quot;sliding-mesh&quot;) design where gear changes involved sliding the gears along their shafts so that the desired cogs became meshed. The driver was therefore required to use careful timing and throttle manipulation when shifting, so the gears would be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh. This was difficult to achieve, so gear changes were often accompanied by grinding or crunching sounds, resulting in the gearboxes being nicknamed &quot;crash boxes&quot;. Even after passenger cars had switched to synchronous transmissions (i.e. with synchronizers), many transmissions for heavy trucks, motorcycles and racing cars remained non-synchronous, in order to withstand the forces required or provide a faster shift time.

=== 1950s to 1980s ===
The first car to use a manual transmission with synchromesh was the 1929 Cadillac. Most North American marques had adopted synchronized manual transmissions, usually for second and high gears, by the mid-1930s. In 1947, Porsche patented the &quot;split ring&quot; synchromesh system. The 1952 Porsche 356 was the first car to use a transmission with synchromesh on all forward gears. In the early 1950s, most cars only had synchromesh for the shift from third gear to second gear (drivers&#x27; manuals in vehicles suggested that if the driver needed to shift from second to first, it was best to come to a complete stop beforehand).

Up until the late 1970s, most transmissions had three or four forward gear ratios, although five-speed manual transmissions were occasionally used in sports cars such as the 1948 Ferrari 166 Inter and the 1953 Alfa Romeo 1900 Super Sprint. Five-speed transmissions became widespread during the 1980s, as did the use of synchromesh on all forward gears.

=== 1990s to present ===
Six-speed manual transmissions started to emerge in high-performance vehicles in the early 1990s, such as the 1990 BMW 850i and the 1992 Ferrari 456. The first 6-speed manual transmission was introduced in the 1967 Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale. The first 7-speed manual transmission was introduced in the 2012 Porsche 911 (991).

In 2008, 75.2% of vehicles produced in Western Europe were equipped with manual transmission, versus 16.1% with automatic and 8.7% with other.
==Internals==

===Shafts===
A manual transmission has several shafts with various gears and other components attached to them. Most modern passenger cars use &#x27;constant-mesh&#x27; transmissions consisting of three shafts: an &quot;input shaft&quot;, a &quot;countershaft&quot; (also called a layshaft) and an &quot;output shaft&quot;.

The &quot;input shaft&quot; is connected to the engine and spins at engine speed whenever the clutch is engaged. The &quot;countershaft&quot; has gears of various sizes, which are permanently meshed with the corresponding gear on the input shaft. The gears on the &quot;output shaft&quot; are also permanently meshed with a corresponding gear on the countershaft; however, the output shaft gears are able to rotate independently of the output shaft itself (through the use of bearings located between the gears and the shaft). Through the use of collars (operated using the &quot;shift rods&quot;), the speed of the output shaft becomes temporarily locked to the speed of the selected gear. Some transmission designs—such as in the Volvo 850 and S70—have two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle&#x27;s ring gear. This allows for a narrower transmission since the length of each countershaft is halved compared with one that contains four gears and two shifters.

The fixed and free gears can be mounted on either the input or output shaft or both. For example, a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the main shaft. This means that when the vehicle is stopped and idling in neutral with the clutch engaged and the input shaft spinning, the third-, fourth-, and fifth-gear pairs do not rotate.

When neutral is selected, none of the gears on the output shaft are locked to the shaft, allowing the input and output shafts to rotate independently. For reverse gear, an idler gear is used to reverse the direction in which the output shaft rotates. In many transmissions, the input and output shafts can be directly locked together (bypassing the countershaft) to create a 1:1 gear ratio which is referred to as &quot;direct-drive&quot;.

In a transmission for longitudinal engined vehicles (e.g. most rear-wheel-drive cars), it is common for the input shaft and output shaft to be located on the same axis, since this reduces the torsional forces to which the transmission casing must withstand. The assembly consisting of both the input and output shafts is referred to as the &quot;main shaft&quot; (although sometimes this term refers to just the input shaft or output shaft). Independent rotation of the input and output shafts is made possible by one shaft being located inside the hollow bore of the other shaft, with a bearing located between the two shafts.

In a transmission for transverse engined vehicles (e.g., front-wheel-drive cars), there are usually only two shafts: input and countershaft (sometimes called input and output). The input shaft runs the whole length of the gearbox, and there is no separate input pinion. These transmissions also have an integral differential unit, which is connected via a pinion gear at the end of the counter/output shaft.


===Dog clutch===
In a modern constant-mesh manual transmission, the gear teeth are permanently in contact with each other, and dog clutches (sometimes called &quot;dog teeth&quot;) are used to select the gear ratio for the transmission. When the dog clutches for all gears are disengaged (i.e. when the transmission is in neutral), all of the gears are able to spin freely around the output shaft. When the driver selects a gear, the dog clutch for that gear is engaged (via the gear selector rods), locking the transmission&#x27;s output shaft to a particular gear set. This means the output shaft rotates at the same speed as the selected gear, thus determining the gear ratio of the transmission.

The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism that sits around the output shaft. It has teeth to fit into the splines on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate at the same speed as the gear hub. However, the clutch can move back and forth on the shaft, to either engage or disengage the splines. This movement is controlled by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft. Unlike some other types of clutches (such as the foot-operated clutch of a manual-transmission car), a dog clutch provides non-slip coupling and is not suited to intentional slipping.

===Synchromesh===

In order to provide smooth gearshifts without requiring the driver to manually match the engine revs for each gearshift, most modern passenger car transmissions use &#x27;synchromesh&#x27; (also called &#x27;synchronizer rings&#x27;) on the forward gears. These devices automatically match the speed of the input shaft with that of the gear being selected, thus removing the need for the driver to use techniques such as double-clutching. The synchromesh transmission was invented in 1919 by Earl Avery Thompson and first used on production cars by Cadillac in 1928.

The need for synchromesh in a constant-mesh transmission is that the dog clutches require the input shaft speed to match that of the gear being selected; otherwise, the dog teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. Therefore, to speed up or slow down the input shaft as required, cone-shaped brass synchronizer rings are attached to each gear. When the driver moves the gearshift lever towards the next gear, these synchronizer rings press on the cone-shaped sleeve on the dog collar so that the friction forces can reduce the difference in rotational speeds. Once these speeds are equalized, the dog clutch can engage, and thus the new gear is now in use. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed. Many transmissions do not include synchromesh on the reverse gear (see Reverse gear section below).

The synchromesh system must also prevent the collar from bridging the locking rings while the speeds are still being synchronized. This is achieved through &#x27;blocker rings&#x27; (also called &#x27;baulk rings&#x27;). The synchro ring rotates slightly because of the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. Once the speeds are synchronized, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and the blocker ring twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow the dog clutch to fall into the engagement.

Common metals for synchronizer rings are brass and steel, and are produced either by forging or sheet metal shaping. The latter involves stamping the piece out of a sheet metal strip and then machining to obtain the exact shape required. The rings are sometimes coated with anti-wear linings (also called &#x27;friction linings&#x27;) made from molybdenum, iron, bronze or carbon (with the latter usually reserved for high-performance transmissions due to their high cost).

Mechanical wear of the synchronizer rings and sleeves can cause the synchromesh system to become ineffective over time. These rings and sleeves have to overcome the momentum of the entire input shaft and clutch disk during each gearshift (and also the momentum and power of the engine, if the driver attempts a gearshift without fully disengaging the clutch). Larger differences in speed between the input shaft and the gear require higher friction forces from the synchromesh components, potentially increasing their wear rate.

=== Reverse gear ===
Even in modern transmissions where all of the forward gears are in a constant-mesh configuration, often the reverse gear uses the older &quot;sliding-mesh&quot; (&quot;crash box&quot;) configuration. This means that moving the gearshift lever into reverse results in gears moving to mesh together. Another unique aspect of the reverse gear is that it consists of two gears—an idler gear on the countershaft and another gear on the output shaft—and both of these are directly fixed to the shaft (i.e. they are always rotating at the same speed as the shaft). These gears are usually spur gears with straight-cut teeth which—unlike the helical teeth used for forward gear—results in a whining sound as the vehicle moves in reverse.

When reverse gear is selected, the idler gear is physically moved to mesh with the corresponding gears on the input and output shafts. To avoid grinding as the gears begin to the mesh, they need to be stationary. Since the input shaft is often still spinning due to momentum (even after the car has stopped), a mechanism is needed to stop the input shaft, such as using the synchronizer rings for fifth gear. However, some vehicles do employ a synchromesh system for the reverse gear, thus preventing possible crunching if reverse gear is selected while the input shaft is still spinning.

Most transmissions include a lockout mechanism to prevent reverse gear from being accidentally selected while the car is moving forwards. This can take the form of a collar underneath the gear knob which needs to be lifted or requiring extra force to push the gearshift lever into the plane of reverse gear.

=== Non-synchronous transmission ===
Another design of transmission that is used in older cars, trucks, and tractors, is a non-synchronous transmission (also known as a crash gearbox). Non-synchronous transmissions use a sliding-mesh (or constant-mesh, in later years) design and have the nickname &quot;crash&quot; because the difficulty in changing gears can lead to gear shifts accompanied by crashing/crunching noises.
== Clutch ==
Vehicles with manual transmissions use a clutch to manage the linkage between the engine and the transmission, and decouple the transmission from the engine during gearshifts and when the vehicle is stationary. Without a clutch, the engine would stall any time the vehicle stopped, and changing gears would be difficult (deselecting a gear while the transmission requires the driver to adjust the throttle so that the transmission is not under load, and selecting a gear requires the engine RPM to be at the exact speed that matches the road speed for the gear being selected).

Most motor vehicles use a pedal to operate the clutch; except for motorcycles, which usually have a clutch lever on the left handlebar. 
== Gear shift types ==


In most vehicles with a manual transmission, the driver selects gears by manipulating a lever called a &quot;gear stick&quot; (also called a &quot;gearshift&quot;, &quot;gear lever&quot; or &quot;shifter&quot;). In most automobiles, the gear stick is located on the floor between the driver and front passenger, but some cars have a gear stick that is mounted to the steering column or center console.

The movement of the gear stick is transferred (via solid linkages or cables) to the selector forks within the transmission.

Motorcycles typically employ sequential manual transmissions, although the shift pattern is modified slightly for safety reasons. Gear selection is usually via the left-foot (or, on older motorcycles; right-foot) shift lever with a layout of 

=== &quot;Three on the tree&quot; vs. &quot;four on the floor&quot; ===
During the period when U.S. vehicles usually had only three forward speeds, the most common gear-shifter location was on the steering column, a layout that was sometimes called &quot;three on the tree&quot;. By contrast, high-performance cars, and European vehicles in general, mostly used a four-speed transmission with floor-mounted shifters. That layout was referred to as &quot;four on the floor&quot;.

Most FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive) vehicles have a transmission that sits between the driver and the front passenger seat. Floor-mounted shifters are often connected directly to the transmission. FF (front-engined, front-wheel drive) vehicles, RR (rear-engined, rear-wheel drive) vehicles and front-engined vehicles with rear-mounted gearboxes often require a mechanical linkage to connect the shifter to the transmission.

=== Column-mounted shifter ===

Some vehicles have a gear lever mounted on the steering column. A 3-speed column shifter, which came to be popularly known as a &quot;three on the tree&quot;, began appearing in America in the late 1930s and became common during the 1940s and 1950s. If a U.S. vehicle was equipped with overdrive, it was very likely to be a Borg-Warner type, operated by briefly backing off the accelerator pedal when above to enable, and momentarily flooring the same pedal to return to normal gear. The control simply disables overdrive for such situations as parking on a hill or preventing unwanted shifting into overdrive.

Later, European and Japanese models began to have 4-speed column shifters with this shift pattern:

A majority of North American-spec vehicles sold in the U.S. and Canada had a 3-speed column-mounted shifter—the first generation Chevrolet/GMC vans of 1964–70 vintage had an ultra-rare 4-speed column shifter. The column-mounted manual shifter disappeared in North America by the mid-1980s, last appearing in the 1987 Chevrolet pickup truck. Prior to 1980, the GM X platform compacts (Chevrolet Nova and its rebadged corporate clones) were the final passenger cars to have a column-mounted manual shifter. Outside North America, the column-mounted shifter remained in production. All Toyota Crown and Nissan Cedric taxis in Hong Kong had the 4-speed column shift until 1999 when automatic transmissions were first offered. Since the late 1980s or early 1990s, a 5-speed column shifter has been offered in some vans sold in Asia and Europe, such as Toyota Hiace, Mitsubishi L400 and the first-gen Fiat Ducato. Many European cars had manual column shifts and the Renault 16TX had a 5 speed.

Column shifters are mechanically similar to floor shifters, although shifting occurs in a vertical plane instead of a horizontal one. Because the shifter is further away from the transmission, and the movements at the shifter and at the transmission are in different planes, column shifters require more complicated linkage than floor shifters. Advantages of a column shifter are the ability to switch between the two most commonly used gears—second and third—without letting go of the steering wheel, and the lack of interference with passenger seating space in vehicles equipped with a bench seat.

===Console-mounted shifter===
Some smaller cars in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Citroën 2CV, Renault 4 and early Renault 5 feature a shifter in the dash panel. This was cheaper to manufacture than a column shifter and more practical, as the gearbox was mounted in front of the engine. The linkage for the shifter could then be positioned on top of the engine. The disadvantage is that shifting is less comfortable and usually slower to operate.

Newer small cars and MPVs, like the Suzuki MR Wagon, the Fiat Multipla, the Toyota Matrix, the Pontiac Vibe, the Chrysler RT platform cars, the Honda Element, the Honda Civic, the Daihatsu Sigra, and the Honda Avancier, may feature a manual or automatic transmission gear shifter located on the vehicle&#x27;s instrument panel, similar to the mid-1950s Chryslers and Powerglide Corvairs. Console-mounted shifters are similar to floor-mounted gear shifters in that most of the ones used in modern vehicles operate on a horizontal plane and can be mounted to the vehicle&#x27;s transmission in much the same way a floor-mounted shifter can. However, because of the location of the gear shifter in comparison to the locations of the column shifter and the floor shifter, as well as the positioning of the shifter to the rest of the controls on the panel often require that the gearshift be mounted in a space that does not feature a lot of controls integral to the vehicle&#x27;s operation, or frequently used controls, such as those for the stereo system or HVAC system, to help prevent accidental activation or driver confusion.

More and more small cars and vans from manufacturers such as Suzuki, Honda, and Volkswagen are featuring console shifters in that they free up space on the floor for other features such as storage compartments without requiring that the gear shift be mounted on the steering column. Also, the basic location of the gear shift in comparison to the column shifter makes console shifters easier to operate than column shifters.
== External overdrive ==

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, fuel-efficient highway cruising with low engine speed was in some cases enabled on vehicles equipped with 3- or 4-speed transmissions by means of a separate overdrive unit in or behind the rear housing of the transmission. This was actuated either manually while in high gear by throwing a switch or pressing a button on the gearshift knob or on the steering column, or automatically by momentarily lifting the foot from the accelerator with the vehicle traveling above a certain road speed. Automatic overdrives were disengaged by flooring the accelerator, and a lockout control was provided to enable the driver to disable overdrive and operate the transmission as a normal (non-overdrive) transmission.

The term &#x27;overdrive&#x27; is also used to describe a gear with a ratio of less than one (e.g., if the top gear of the transmission has a ratio of 0.8:1).

== Push starting ==
Vehicles with a manual transmission can often be push started when the starter motor is not operational, such as when the car has a dead battery or when the starter motor itself has malfunctioned and is unable to deliver sufficient rotational energy to turn the engine over. 

When push-starting, the energy generated by the wheels moving on the road is transferred to the driveshaft, then the transmission, and eventually the crankshaft. When the crankshaft spins as a result of the energy generated by the rolling of the vehicle, the motor is cranked over. This simulates what the starter is intended for and operates in a similar way to crank handles on very old cars from the early 20th century, with the cranking motion being replaced by the pushing of the car.

== Driving techniques ==
Recently, many automatic transmissions have included more gear ratios than their manual counterparts.

In some countries, a driving license issued for vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a license for manual transmissions covers both.

=== Hill starts ===
Starting from a stationary position in a manual transmission vehicle requires extra torque to accelerate the vehicle up the hill, with the potential for the vehicle to roll backward in the time it takes to move the driver&#x27;s foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal (to increase the engine RPM before engaging the clutch). A traditional method of hill starts in a manual transmission car is to use the parking brake (also called &quot;handbrake&quot;, &quot;emergency brake&quot;, or &quot;e-brake&quot;) to hold the vehicle stationary. This means that the driver&#x27;s right foot is not needed to operate the brake pedal, freeing it up to be used on the accelerator pedal instead. Once the required engine RPM is obtained, the driver can engage the clutch, also releasing the parking brake as the clutch engages.

A device called the hill-holder was introduced on the 1936 Studebaker. Many modern vehicles use an electronically actuated parking brake, which often includes a hill-holder feature whereby the parking brake is automatically released as the driven wheels start to receive power from the engine.

In many light-duty vehicles, skilled drivers can slip the clutch just barely enough to hold the vehicle from much rollback during the second while the right foot is moving from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal; this method effectively solves the hill-holding problem without any parking brake use and with negligible clutch life reduction, although it requires some skill.

=== Other driving techniques ===
* Rev-matching is where the driver uses the throttle to match the revs to the road speed so that gear changes are not jerky. This is commonly used by drivers with non-synchromesh gearboxes, or those driving racing vehicles
* Double-clutching is required on non-synchro gearboxes. To double-clutch while downshifting: depress the clutch pedal and move the gear lever to neutral, release the clutch pedal, &quot;blip&quot; the throttle to speed up the layshaft to increase the rotational speed of the lower gear, depress the clutch pedal again, move the gear lever to the lower gear, then release the clutch pedal.
* Heel-and-toe shifting is where the driver uses one foot to modulate the brake and accelerator pedal simultaneously to allow for rev matching under braking.
* Rowing, block shifting or skip shifting is the technique of downshifting more than one gear in order to reduce wear and tear on the gearbox. Rev-matching may need to be used to create a smooth shift. Combining this with Heel-and Toe downshifting provides for maximum braking when going from top gear to a much lower gear, and optimal engine RPM for exiting the corner.

== Synchronized downshift rev-matching system ==
The synchronized down shift rev-matching system is a computer-controlled technology that mimics the manual rev-matching technique.

== Truck transmissions ==

Some trucks have transmissions that look and behave like ordinary consumer vehicle transmissions—these transmissions are used on lighter trucks, typically have up to 6 gears, and usually have synchromesh.

For trucks needing more gears, the standard &quot;H&quot; pattern can be complicated for some truck drivers, so additional controls are used to select additional gears. The &quot;H&quot; pattern is retained, then an additional control selects among alternatives. In older trucks, the control is often a separate lever mounted on the floor or more recently a pneumatic switch mounted on the &quot;H&quot; lever; in newer trucks, the control is often an electrical switch mounted on the &quot;H&quot; lever. Multi-control transmissions are built in much higher power ratings but rarely use synchromesh.

There are several common alternatives for the shifting pattern. The standard types are:

*Range transmissions use an &quot;H&quot; pattern through a narrow range of gears, then a &quot;range&quot; control shifts the &quot;H&quot; pattern between high and low ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through fourth gears are accessed when a low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth gears, the range selector is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through fourth gear positions. In high range, the first gear position becomes fifth, the second gear position becomes sixth, and so on.
*Splitter transmissions use an &quot;H&quot; pattern with a wide range of gears, and the other selector splits each sequential gear position in two: First gear is in the first position/low split, second gear is in the first position/high split, third gear is in second position/low split, fourth gear is in second position/high split, and so on.
*Range-splitter transmissions combine range-splitting and gear-splitting. This allows even more gear ratios. Both a range selector and a splitter selector are provided.

Although there are many gear positions, shifting through gears usually follows a regular pattern. For example, a series of up shifts might use &quot;move to splitter direct; move to splitter overdrive; move the shift lever to No. 2 and move splitter to underdrive; move splitter to direct; move splitter to overdrive; move the shifter to No. 3 and move splitter to underdrive&quot;; and so on. In older trucks using floor-mounted levers, a bigger problem is common gear shifts require the drivers to move their hands between shift levers in a single shift, and without synchromesh, shifts must be carefully timed or the transmission will not engage. For this reason, some splitter transmissions have an additional &quot;under under&quot; range, so when the splitter is already in &quot;under&quot; it can be quickly downshifted again, without the delay of a double shift.

Modern truck transmissions are most commonly &quot;range-splitter&quot;. The most common 13-speed has a standard H pattern, and the pattern from the left upper corner is as follows: R, down to L, over and up to 1, down to 2, up and over to 3, down to 4. The &quot;butterfly&quot; range lever in the center front of the knob is flipped up to high range while in 4th, then shifted back to 1. The 1 through 4 positions of the knob is repeated. Also, each can be split using the thumb-actuated under-overdrive lever on the left side of the knob while in high range. The &quot;thumb&quot; lever is not available in low range, except in 18 speeds; 1 through 4 in the low range can be split using the thumb lever and L can be split with the &quot;Butterfly&quot; lever. L cannot be split using the thumb lever in either the 13- or 18-speed. The 9-speed transmission is like a 13-speed without the under-overdrive thumb lever.

Truck transmissions use many physical layouts. For example, the output of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a &quot;Brownie&quot; or &quot;Brownie box&quot; after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a &quot;two-speed rear end&quot;. Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two counter shafts, so each main shaft gear can be driven from one or the other countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust countershafts, while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single gear case.

Heavy-duty transmissions are mostly non-synchromesh. Sometimes synchromesh adds weight that could be payload, and is one more thing to fail, and drivers spend thousands of hours driving so can take the time to learn to drive efficiently with a non-synchromesh transmission. Float shifting (also called &quot;floating gears&quot;) is changing gears without disengaging the clutch, usually on a non-synchronized transmission used by large trucks. Since the clutch is not used, it is easy to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission.

Heavy trucks are usually powered with diesel engines. Diesel truck engines from the 1970s and earlier tend to have a narrow power band, so they need many close-spaced gears. Starting with the 1968 Maxidyne, diesel truck engines have increasingly used turbochargers and electronic controls that widen the power band, allowing fewer and fewer gear ratios. As of 2021, fleet operators often use 9, 10, 13, or 18-speed transmissions, but automated manual transmissions are becoming more common on heavy vehicles, as they can improve efficiency and drivability, reduce the barrier to entry for new drivers, and may improve safety by allowing the driver to concentrate on road conditions. 

== Lubrication ==

Manual transmissions are lubricated with gear oil (or engine oil in some vehicles) which must be changed periodically in some vehicles, although not as frequently as the fluid in an automatic transmission. Gear oil has a characteristic aroma because it contains added sulfur-bearing anti-wear compounds. These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical gear cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of straight-cut spur gears). On motorcycles with &quot;wet&quot; clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating the lower part of the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission.

<text>The computer file hosts is an operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is a plain text file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by Stanford Research Institute for the ARPANET membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations. The Domain Name System, first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984, automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hosts file remains an alternative name resolution mechanism, configurable often as part of facilities such as the Name Service Switch as either the primary method or as a fallback method.

==Purpose==
The hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating system&#x27;s Internet Protocol (IP) implementation, and serves the function of translating human-friendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called IP addresses, that identify and locate a host in an IP network.

In some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), but many systems implement name service switches, e.g., nsswitch.conf for Linux and Unix, to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer&#x27;s administrator.

==File content==

The hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an IP address in the first text field followed by one or more host names. The host names map to the IPs, not vice versa. Each field is separated by white space – tabs are often preferred for historical reasons, but spaces are also used. Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by an octothorpe (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:
 127.0.0.1 localhost loopback
 ::1 localhost
This example only contains entries for the loopback addresses of the system and their host names, a typical default content of the hosts file. The example illustrates that an IP address may have multiple host names (&quot;localhost&quot; and &quot;loopback&quot;), and that a host name may be mapped to both IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses, as shown on the first and second lines respectively.

==Location in the file system==
The location of the hosts file in the file system hierarchy varies by operating system. It is usually named &quot;hosts&quot;, without an extension.
==History==
The ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, had no distributed host name database. Each network node maintained its own map of the network nodes as needed and assigned them names that were memorable to the users of the system. There was no method for ensuring that all references to a given node in a network were using the same name, nor was there a way to read the hosts file of another computer to automatically obtain a copy.

The small size of the ARPANET kept the administrative overhead small to maintain an accurate hosts file. Network nodes typically had one address and could have many names. As local area TCP/IP computer networks gained popularity, however, the maintenance of hosts files became a larger burden on system administrators as networks and network nodes were being added to the system with increasing frequency.

Standardization efforts, such as the format specification of the file &quot;HOSTS.TXT&quot; in RFC 952, and distribution protocols, e.g., the hostname server described in RFC 953, helped with these problems, but the centralized and monolithic nature of hosts files eventually necessitated the creation of the distributed Domain Name System (DNS).

On some old systems a file named networks is present that is similar to a hosts file, containing names of networks.

==Extended applications==
In its function of resolving host names, the hosts file may be used to define any hostname or domain name for use in the local system.

;Redirecting local domains: Some web service and intranet developers and administrators define locally defined domains in a LAN for various purposes, such as accessing the company&#x27;s internal resources or to test local websites in development.

;Internet resource blocking: Entries in the hosts file may be used to block online advertising, or the domains of known malicious resources and servers that contain spyware, adware, and other malware. This may be achieved by adding entries for those sites to redirect requests to another address that does not exist or to a harmless destination such as the local machine. Commercial software applications may be used to populate the hosts file with entries of known undesirable Internet resources automatically. In addition, user-created hosts files which block nuisance servers are publicly available.

:Fravia described these files variously as &quot;scrolls&quot;, &quot;precious&quot;, and &quot;powerful&quot; in his anti-advertisement pages, where this usage of hosts was first published.

;Software piracy: Some pirated versions of software rely on a modified hosts file to prevent software from contacting the activation servers of the publisher, although activation servers sometimes appear in general purpose hosts files.

==Security issues==
The hosts file may present an attack vector for malicious software. The file may be modified, for example, by adware, computer viruses, or trojan horse software to redirect traffic from the intended destination to sites hosting malicious or unwanted content. The widespread computer worm Mydoom.B blocked users from visiting sites about computer security and antivirus software and also affected access from the compromised computer to the Microsoft Windows Update website.

In some cases, malware has modified the library responsible for loading the hosts file in order to redirect it to a file it is able to control freely.

<text>The English-speaking world comprises the 88 countries and territories in which English is an official, administrative, or cultural language. In the early 2000s, between one and two billion people spoke English, making it the largest language by number of speakers, the third largest language by number of native speakers and the most widespread language geographically. The countries in which English is the native language of most people are sometimes termed the Anglosphere. Speakers of English are called Anglophones. 

Early Medieval England was the birthplace of the English language; the modern form of the language has been spread around the world since the 17th century, first by the worldwide influence of England and later the United Kingdom, and then by that of the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional fields, such as science, navigation and law.

The United States and India have the most total English speakers, with 306 million and 129 million, respectively. These are followed by the United Kingdom (68 million), and Nigeria (60 million). As of 2022, there were about 400 million native speakers of English. Including people who speak English as a second language, estimates of the total number of Anglophones vary from 1.5 billion to 2 billion. David Crystal calculated in 2003 that non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of three to one.

Besides the major varieties of English—American, British, Canadian, Australian, Irish, New Zealand English—and their sub-varieties, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries and territories, such as Ghana, also use English as their primary official language even though it is not the native language of most of the people. English holds official status in numerous countries within the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Majority English-speaking countries==

English is the primary natively spoken language in several countries and territories. Five of the largest of these are sometimes described as the &quot;core Anglosphere&quot;; they are the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

The term &quot;Anglosphere&quot; can sometimes be extended to include other countries and territories where English or an English Creole language is also the primary native language and English is the primary language of government and education, such as Ireland, Gibraltar, and the Commonwealth Caribbean. 

While English is also spoken by a majority of people as a second language in a handful of countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, these countries are not considered part of the English-speaking world as the language is still viewed primarily as a foreign tongue and does not serve an important cultural role in society.

==Countries or territories where English is an official language==

English is an official language (&quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot;) of the following countries and territories.

*North America: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, United States, United States Virgin Islands
*South America: Falkland Islands, Guyana
*Europe: Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Malta, United Kingdom
*Africa: Botswana, British Indian Ocean Territory, Cameroon, Eswatini, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
*Asia: Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore
*Oceania: American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Vanuatu

Although not official, English is also an important language in some former colonies and protectorates of the British Empire where it is used as an administrative language, namely Brunei, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka.

==English as a global language==
Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been called a &quot;world language&quot;, the lingua franca of the modern era, and while it is not an official language in most countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. It is, by international treaty, the official language for aeronautical and maritime communications. English is one of the official languages of the United Nations and many other international organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. It is also one of two co-official languages for astronauts (besides the Russian language) serving on board the International Space Station.

The English language has a particular significance in the Commonwealth of Nations, which developed from the British Empire. English is the medium of inter-Commonwealth relations. The English language as used in the Commonwealth has sometimes been referred to as &quot;&quot;, most often interchangeably with &quot;British English&quot;.

English is studied most often in the European Union, and the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 67% in favour of English, ahead of 17% for German and 16% for French (). In some of the non–English-speaking EU countries, the following percentages of adults claimed to be able to converse in English in 2012: 90% in the Netherlands; 89% in Malta; 86% in Sweden and Denmark; 73% in Cyprus, Croatia, and Austria; 70% in Finland; and over 50% in Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Germany. In 2012, excluding native speakers, 38% of Europeans consider that they can speak English.

Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world; English is the most commonly used language in the sciences, with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.

In publishing, English literature predominates considerably, with 28% of all books published in the world [Leclerc 2011] and 30% of web content in 2011 (down from 50% in 2000).

The increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages, leading to language shift and language death, and to claims of linguistic imperialism. English itself has become more open to language shift as multiple regional varieties feed back into the language as a whole.

<text>HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 8 June 1781 at Rotherhithe. The ship was wrecked in a hurricane on 5 November 1799 in Table Bay near the Cape of Good Hope.

==Career==
Shortly after completion she was sent out to the Indian Ocean to join Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes&#x27;s squadron. She arrived in time for the Battle of Trincomalee in 1782. This was the fourth battle of a bloody campaign between Vice-Admiral Hughes and the French Admiral Suffren&#x27;s squadron.

The following year, she took part in the Battle of Cuddalore (1783), the final battle in the East Indies campaign. In the run-up to the battle &quot;Sceptre&quot; captured the &quot;Naïade&quot;, under captain Villaret, on the night of 11 April 1783. &quot;Naïade&quot; was armed with eighteen to twenty 8-pounder guns and ten swivel guns, and had a crew of 160 men. The British took her into service but never commissioned her; they then sold her in August 1784.

She was then laid up for the peace. In 1794, under the command of Commodore John Ford, &quot;Sceptre&quot; assisted in the capture of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

On 12 March 1795, under the command of Captain William Essington, &quot;Sceptre&quot; sailed for the Cape of Good Hope as escort to fleet of East Indiamen sailing to India and China.

===Capture of eight Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena===

When &quot;Sceptre&quot; arrived at St Helena she brought the news that France had invaded the Netherlands in January. Furthermore, under an order dated 9 February 1795, Royal Navy vessels and British letters of marque were to detain Dutch vessels and cargoes and bring them into British ports that they might be detained provisionally. Then on 2 June the British East India Company packet ship &quot;Swallow&quot; arrived from the Cape of Good Hope with the news than a convoy of Dutch East Indiamen had left the Cape, sailing for the Netherlands.

On 18 May 1795, the Dutch brig &quot;Komeet&quot;, under the command of Captain-Lieutenant Mynheer Claris, and the Dutch corvette &quot;Scipio&quot;, under the command of de Jong, set out from Table Bay with a convoy of sixteen East Indiamen, for Europe. Bad weather forced eight Indiamen back to the Cape. These eight sailed again on 22 May.

The remaining eight Indiamen, which had sailed on 18 May together with their two escorts, and a private Dutch ship from the Cape, the whaler &quot;Herstilder&quot;, sailed on. All but two of this group reached ports in then-neutral Norway.

Essington prevailed upon Colonel Brooke, the governor of St Helena, to lend him some troops and to put the British East India Company (EIC) vessels there at the time to form a squadron to try and intercept the Dutch. Providentially, , an East Indiaman under the command of Captain William Taylor Money, was resting at St Helena while on her way back to England. On 3 June, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, &quot;General Goddard&quot;, (also an EIC ship), and &quot;Swallow&quot; set out. Five other HEIC ships set out later, of which only met up with the squadron. On 10 June the British captured the Dutch Indiaman &quot;Hougly&quot;, which &quot;Swallow&quot; escorted into St Helena, before returning to the squadron with additional seamen. Due to bad weather, &quot;Manship&quot; and &quot;Busbridge&quot; lost contact with Essington&#x27;s squadron.

In the afternoon of 14 June, Essington&#x27;s squadron sighted seven sail. At 1 a.m. the next morning &quot;General Goddard&quot; sailed through the Dutch fleet, which fired on her. She did not fire back. Later that morning, after some exchange of shots between the British and Dutch vessels, the Dutch surrendered. The HEIC ships &quot;Busbridge&quot;, Captain Samuel Maitland, and , Captain John Davy Foulkes, arrived on the scene and helped board the Dutch vessels. There were no casualties on either side. The British then brought their prizes into St Helena on 17 June.

On 1 July, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, &quot;General Goddard&quot; and the prizes sailed from St Helena to gather in other returning British East Indiamen. They then returned to St Helena, where George Vancouver and , which had arrived there in the meantime, joined them. The entire convoy, now some 20 vessels or so strong, sailed from there in August to Shannon, where most arrived on 13 December. (Three Dutch vessels were lost. &quot;Houghly&quot; was lost on 1 September. &quot;Surcheance&quot; was lost on 5 September. &quot;Zeelelie&quot; escaped and wrecked off the Scilly Islands on 26 September.) &quot;General Goddard&quot; reached the Downs on 15 October.

Because the captures occurred before Britain had declared war on the Batavian Republic, the vessels become Droits to the Crown. Still, prize money, in the amount of two-thirds of the value of the Dutch ships amounted to £76,664 14s. Of this, £61,331 15s 2d was distributed among the officers and crew of &quot;Sceptre&quot;, &quot;General Goddard&quot;, &quot;Busbridge&quot;, &quot;Asia&quot;, and &quot;Swallow&quot;.

==Wrecking==
While under the command of Captain Valentine Edwards, &quot;Sceptre&quot; was caught at anchor in a storm on 5 November 1799 along with seven other ships in Table Bay, near the Cape of Good Hope. At 10:30am, the captain ordered the topmasts struck, and the fore and main yards lowered in order to ease the ship in the strengthening winds. At midday, the ship fired a &quot;feu de joie&quot; on the occasion of the Gunpowder Plot, suggesting no apparent apprehension about the oncoming storm. However within half an hour, the main anchor cable parted and despite the laying of a secondary one, this also broke. At approximately 7pm, the ship was driven ashore onto a reef at Woodstock Beach at the site of the present-day Royal Cape Yacht Club and battered to pieces. One account states approximately 349 seamen and marines were killed or drowned. One officer, two midshipmen, 47 seamen, and one marine were saved from the wreck, but nine of these died on the beach. The ship was wrecked a few hundred meters from the spot where a similar sized Danish warship, the &quot;Oldenborg&quot; was also wrecked in the same hurricane.

On 14 December, the surviving junior officers and crew were subjected to a court martial (standard on the loss of a ship) but all were acquitted and no blame was apportioned for the loss of the ship.

<text>In linguistics, a nonce word—also called an occasionalism—is any word (lexeme), or any sequence of sounds or letters, created for a single occasion or utterance but not otherwise understood or recognized as a word in a given language. Nonce words have a variety of functions and are most commonly used for humor, poetry, children&#x27;s literature, linguistic experiments, psychological studies, and medical diagnoses, or they arise by accident.

Some nonce words have a meaning at their inception or gradually acquire a fixed meaning inferred from context and use, but if they eventually become an established part of the language (neologisms), they stop being nonce words. Other nonce words may be essentially meaningless and disposable (nonsense words), but they are useful for exactly that reason—the words &quot;wug&quot; and &quot;blicket&quot; for instance were invented by researchers to be used in child language testing. Nonsense words often share orthographic and phonetic similarity with (meaningful) words, as is the case with pseudowords, which make no sense but can still be pronounced in accordance with a language&#x27;s phonotactic rules. Such invented words are used by psychology and linguistics researchers and educators as tools to assess a learner&#x27;s phonetic decoding ability, and the ability to infer the (hypothetical) meaning of a nonsense word from context is used to test for brain damage. Proper names of real or fictional entities sometimes originate as nonce words.

The term is used because such a word is created &quot;&quot; (i.e., for the time being, or this once), coming from James Murray, editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary.&quot; Some analyses consider nonce words to fall broadly under neologisms, which are usually defined as words relatively recently accepted into a language&#x27;s vocabulary; other analyses do not.

==Types of nonce words==
A variety of more specific concepts used by scholars falls under the umbrella of &quot;nonce words&quot;, of which overlap is also sometimes possible:
*nonsense word: a nonce word that is meaningless 
**nonword: a nonsense word that is not even pronounceable in a particular language
**pseudoword: a nonsense word that still follows the phonotactics of a particular language and is therefore pronounceable, feeling to native speakers like a possible word (for example, in English, &quot;blurk&quot; is a pseudoword, but &quot;bldzkg&quot; is a nonword); thus, pseudowords follow a language&#x27;s phonetic rules but have no meaning
*ghost word: a nonce word authoritatively described in a reference work that turns out to have originated from a typo or other simple error
*protologism: a nonce word that has achieved repeated usage, perhaps even by a small group but not beyond that (an intermediate step towards a neologism)
*stunt word: a nonce word intentionally coined to demonstrate the creator&#x27;s cleverness or elicit an emotional reaction, such as admiration or laughter; such words are often noted in the works of Dr. Seuss, as in &quot;Sometimes I am quite certain there&#x27;s a Jertain in the curtain&quot;, in which the one-time use of &quot;Jertain&quot; refers to some unspecified fictional creature purely invented to create a whimsical rhyme with &quot;certain&quot; and &quot;curtain&quot;

===Similar or related concepts===
Many types of other words can also be meaningful nonce words, as is true of most sniglets (words, often stunt words, explicitly coined in the absence of any relevant dictionary word). Other types of misinterpretations or humorous re-wordings can also be nonce words, as may occur in word play, such as certain examples of puns, spoonerisms, malapropisms, etc. Furthermore, meaningless nonce words can occur unintentionally or spontaneously, for instance through errors (typographical or otherwise) or through keysmashes.

==In child development studies==

Nonce words are sometimes used to study the development of language in children, because they allow researchers to test how children treat words of which they have no prior knowledge. This permits inferences about the default assumptions children make about new word meanings, syntactic structure, etc. &quot;Wug&quot; is among the earliest known nonce words used in language learning studies, and is best known for its use in Jean Berko&#x27;s &quot;Wug test&quot;, in which children were presented with a novel object, called a wug, and then shown multiple instances of the object and asked to complete a sentence that elicits a plural form—e.g., &quot;This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...?&quot; The use of the plural form &quot;wugs&quot; by the children suggests that they have applied a plural rule to the form, and that this knowledge is not specific to prior experience with the word but applies to most English nouns, whether familiar or novel.

Nancy N. Soja, Susan Carey, and Elizabeth Spelke used &quot;blicket&quot;, &quot;stad&quot;, &quot;mell&quot;, &quot;coodle&quot;, &quot;doff&quot;, &quot;tannin&quot;, &quot;fitch&quot;, and &quot;tulver&quot; as nonce words when testing to see if children&#x27;s knowledge of the distinction between non-solid substances and solid objects preceded or followed their knowledge of the distinction between mass nouns and count nouns.

== In literature ==

A poem by Seamus Heaney titled &quot;Nonce Words&quot; is included in his collection &quot;District and Circle&quot;. David Crystal reported &quot;fluddle&quot;, which he understood to mean a water spillage between a puddle and a flood, invented by the speaker because no suitable word existed. Crystal speculated in 1995 that it might enter the English language if it proved popular. &quot;Bouba&quot; and &quot;kiki&quot; are used to demonstrate a connection between the sound of a word and its meaning. &quot;Grok&quot;, coined by Robert Heinlein in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, is now used by many to mean &quot;deeply and intuitively understand&quot;. The poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; is full of nonce words, of which two, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, have entered into common use. The novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; used &quot;quark&quot; (&quot;three quarks for Muster Mark&quot;) as a nonce word; the physicist Murray Gell-Mann adopted it as the name of a subatomic particle.

<text>The Moss is a brook in North East Derbyshire, England.

When Rother Valley Country Park was built in the 1980s, constructors used water from The Moss to fill the lakes.

==Name==
The name of the river derives from &quot;Moss Beck&quot;, which means &#x27;stream through marshy ground&#x27;.

==Course==
The river flows through the Moss Valley and through the villages of Geerlane, Birley Hay, Ford and Eckington. It passes through several areas of woodland, including Coalpit Wood, Long Wood and Eckington Park. The main tributaries of The Moss are the Robin Brook, the Owler Car Brook, Sickle Brook, Troway Brook, Sloadlane Brook, and Ridgeway Brook.

The source of the Moss can be found just to the east of Jordanthorpe Parkway (B6057 road). The source is a natural spring which lies in an area of woodland called Coalpit Wood. The stream flows broadly eastwards, and is joined by several other streams, all rising from springs within woodland. Owler Car Brook flows to the north west through Whinacre Wood, Cook Spring Wood and Owler Car Wood to join the south bank, and soon afterwards, a larger stream flowing southwards from Lightwood through Newfield Spring Wood joins on the north bank. Sickle Brook rises to the west of Troway and flows through Mires Spring Wood and Brownstorth Wood to join on the south bank. Below the junction, where there is a ford across the river, the surrounding land is less wooded, although there are patches of trees. Another tributary rises from springs in Charnock Hall, and flows southwards through Charnock Wood, Carterhall Wood and Ryall&#x27;s Wood to reach the north bank, and Troway Brook rises to the east of Troway and flows northwards. As the river passes Geer Lane Farm, there are a number of ponds on the northern bank.

As it approaches the hamlet of Birley Hay, which is considerably smaller than it was in 1886, the river powered a scythe manufactory. Below the outlet weir is a small grade II listed 18th century cottage which was associated with the manufactory and a warehouse which also dates from the late 18th century. The millpond and part of the water-powered forge still exist, but are not listed structures. Soon afterwards, a small river flows northwards to join the south bank. It contains two large mill ponds, which powered the Skelper Forge and Wheel. A bridge carries Geer Lane over the river to join Ford Lane, which then crosses back over the river and the Robin Brook at the hamlet of Ford. Robin Brook flows southwards from Base Green, and joins the north bank of The Moss just below the bridge. Another mill pond lies just to the north of the river, whereas most of the previous ones have dammed the main channel. If formerly powered Ford Wheel. There is another mill pond to the south of the river, which was filled by a stream rising at Bramley and flowing northwards. It once powered Sough Wheel.

Neverfear Dam, a little further downstream is, like the Ford dam, on the north side of the main channel, which flowed over a weir to continue on its way. The dam, a term used locally to describe the body of water, rather than the structure that creates it, powered Neverfear Wheel. Next the river reaches the site of Field&#x27;s Wheel, where there are three weirs, but little remains of the dam. Beyond it, the river was once crossed by a tramway, which ran along the south bank from a shaft, and then turned abruptly north to ascend up a long inclined plane to buildings at the top of the slope. It had been removed by 1898, and sometime between 1923 and 1937, Footrail dam was constructed at the site of the crossing. The body of water stretched back almost to the weirs at Field&#x27;s Wheel, but by 1967 it had been reduced to a small pond to the north of the main channel. Carlton Wheel Dam supplied Carlton Wheel, which was another inline pond with a weir at the outlet. Lady Ida&#x27;s Drive crosses just below where the weir was, and to the south of the river is the site of Plumbley Colliery, a scheduled monument because it is a good example of a late 19th century coal mine. The remains include the Seldom Seen engine house, a Guibal fan house, the remains of coking ovens, and a conical spoil heap. It was operational between 1875 and 1914.

As the river approaches Eckington, there is another weir by Gasworks Lane Bridge, which formerly supplied Park Mill, a flour mill which was no longer marked as such by 1967. Eckington gas works was located on the south bank of the river, which then passes under the A6135 Sheffield Road and the B6053 Rotherham Road. There was once a sluice by the first bridge, which fed a saw mill by the second, but the building had been demolished by 1923. The river passes along the northern edge of the Rotherside Road Business Park and joins the west bank of the River Rother, which flows to the north at this point. At the southern edge of the business park, Eckington Mine was a drift mine where coal continued to be extracted until it unexpectedly closed in 2019. The site has since been made safe by the Coal Authority.

The river forms the ancient southern boundary of the manor of Mosborough, between its confluence with the River Rother and the point upstream of the Never Fear dam, where the Ridgeway Brook joins from the north. It then follows that stream for much of its length.

==Moss Valley==
Moss Valley is the name of the valley carved out by The Moss, located in North East Derbyshire, just south of Sheffield, England. Nearby settlements include Charnock, Troway, Eckington, Mosborough, and Ridgeway.

Moss Valley is home to the Eckington Woods and Bluebell Woods, the latter being a local term coined because of the quantity of bluebells which cover the woods in the springtime.

The valley, which is formed by The Moss and its tributaries, covers an area of about .

===Industry===
Moss Valley, due to its location next to a river near several coal seams and rock outcrops, has seen much industry over its history.

Moss Valley has a long history of quarrying and mining. The quarries and mines are now closed, including the coal mine near to where The Moss flows into the River Rother. Eckington Coal Mine was a drift mine opened in 1993 by Moorside Mining Co., but subsequently owned by others, which closed suddenly in 2019.
There are also several mills in the valley, which was known as a centre for the production of scythes and sickles. In several locations, The Moss has been dammed to create reservoirs and mill ponds.

Foxholes Wheel was located above the confluence with the stream from Charnock Hall. Part of the mill pond called Gill Bridge WHeel Dam was shown on a map dating from 1773, but the map did not include the area where any buildings would have been. The enclosure map of 1796 showed a small building, but no mill pond, while a document from that time referred to it as Woollin Wheel. Little else is known, and evidence on the ground is sparse.

There was a corn mill at Birley Hay in the early 16th century, but a cutler&#x27;s wheel was erected a little before 1599. The millpond was formed by a dam across the valley, which was called Fortitude Dam on a map dating from 1796. The wheel was owned by William and John Mullins at that time, and there were ten grinding troughs. The operation was expanded in 1836, when a forge was constructed, and a second water wheel was added to allow it to be worked independently of the grinding wheels. A range of nearby buildings were associated with the scythe manufactory, which had been bought by Thomas Hutton in 1836. The Hutton family were associated with the site for over one hundred years, as scythes were made there until the 1930s, by T &amp; G Hutton and &amp; Company. Because of the age of the building, maintenance costs rose, and Huttons intended to move production to their steam-powered Phoenix Works at Ridgeway in 1939, but the move was brought forwards to 1938 when the main shaft of the waterwheel broke. The works was sold to the Sitwell estate in 1940, who wanted to use the mill pond as a fish pond. The works lay empty, and in 1944 the machinery was dismantled as part of the war effort, but the ironwork remained on site until 1946. The forge and smithies deteriorated, and were demolished when the fishing lake was sold to new owners. The wheelhouse and the warehouse remain as do the millponds, dams and watercourses, but are on private property, although they can be seen from a nearby public footpath.

Skelper forge and wheel were located on a tributary, on which there were two mill ponds. They appear to have been constructed after 1796, as they do not appear on the enclosure map of that year, but before 1809, since one of the dams failed in January 1809. By 1877, there were no buildings near the upper pond, but there was a building at the north end of the lower pond. It was marked as Old Skelper Wheel, which was shown as disused by 1898, but was not marked as disused subsequently.

Thomas Hutton&#x27;s brother Joseph owned Ford Wheel in 1796, although he did not work it himself, as it was leased to Thomas Slagg. Unlike most of the wheels on the river, it had good access by road. A wood turning shop was added to the site, which may have been the reason that the mill pond was enlarged. The pond is located to the north of the river, and is fed by a goit which leaves the main channel further to the west. Robin Brook feeds into the goit, although there was an arrangement to allow excess water to be diverted back into The Moss. The wheel was later powered by a steam engine. The head race and the pond survive, but nothing else does.

Sough Wheel was built shortly before 1796 on a tributary which runs northwards to join The Moss on its right bank. It was referred to as the &quot;New Wheel&quot; at the time of the inclosure act of 1796, and a map from 1795 shows two buildings, one at the north end of the mill pond and another to the west. It was owned by W &amp; J Mullings, and was leased for about £10 per trough, of which there were two. It was used for grinding sickles, and another slightly later document mentions six troughs. It was unused by 1827.

Never Fear Wheel was powered by a pond to the north of the main channel, which was fed by a long goit, leaving the river where the Ridgeway Brook joined it. The wheel was housed in a building at the south-eastern edge of the pond, which is known to have been there by 1778. In 1796 it contained six troughs. The pond and head goit are still there, although the pond was shown as silted up in 1898, and the main building had been demolished.

Fields Wheel was built around 1780 by William Fields, whose widow and son were managing it by 1796. At that time, it contained four troughs for grinding sickles. The wheel was around in diameter and wide. By 1822, the number of troughs had increased to six. At the end of the 18th century, it was marked as Carlton Upper Wheel on maps, but had reverted to Fields Wheel by 1855. By that date, the mill pond was already partially silted up, and by 1898 it appeared to be completely silted up.

The first known maps of the Lower Carlton Mill date from 1722, when there was a goit running along the south side of the river to power the wheel, but no mill pond. The function of the channels was then changed, when a dam was built across the main river, and the former goit acted as a bypass channel around the wheel. The precise function of the wheel in 1773 is unclear, as it was described as &quot;Carlton Wheel with the CinderHill&quot;, suggesting that it was used for some other purpose as well as grinding sickles. There were nine griding troughs in 1797. The site was known as Lower Carlton Sickle Wheel in 1819, but by 1855 the mill pond was already silting up. The 1886 map shows &quot;Old Weir&quot; to the north of the former goit, with a building to the south, and by 1898 there was a weir on that channel close to the building.

Park Mill was located close to the parish church in Eckington, and is thought to be the site of a watermill mentioned in the Domesday Book. A mill on the site was mentioned in documents dating from 1480 and 1581, but it was rebuilt in the early 19th century, as a sale document from 1828 describes it as a new stone-built corn mill. The rebuild probably followed a serious fire in 1826, and the new building had three floors, stabling for three horses, and a tiled roof. Another serious fire occurred in 1904, and on 24 September 1931 significant damage occurred when the mill dam gave way, resulting in the end wall being destroyed and part of the roof collapsing. Nevertheless, it was rebuilt and continued in operation until the mid 1940s. The two storey building was demolished in the late 1950s or early 1960s. In the mid-19th century, it had an overshot wheel which was in diameter and wide. However, a painting dating from 1953 shows it with a backshot wheel at that time. No details of its internal machinery are known, although two pairs of stones are visible in a photograph taken at the time it was demolished.

===Sport and recreation===
Moss Valley is popular among walkers, ramblers and cyclists. On a bank holiday the woods can be very busy with people, families and groups exploring the woods or linking the woods into a wider walk. Mountain bikers are a common sight in the area, and several trails are popular amongst local cyclists on both the Mosborough and the Eckington sides of the valley. The two ponds on the Ridgeway side are used for private fishing, and there is a car park at this end, as well as the Bridge Inn public house.

===Wildlife===
Multiple locations in the Moss Valley have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature.

The main Moss Valley SSSI consists of a strip of land along both banks of the Moss, starting at Bromehead Wood (just east of Ford) and ending at the Gashouse Lane road bridge just outside Eckington. It has been designated as an SSSI due to its value as a high quality habitat for invertebrates. This site also includes about 5 hectares of the increasingly rare floodplain grazing marsh habitat.

Three distinct locations in the valley have been designated as part of the Moss Valley Meadows SSSI, two along the side valley of the Robin Brook, one of the Moss&#x27;s main tributaries, and one on the south bank of The Moss. The northern section of the SSSI is the largest and consists of a large area of forest clearings in the Near Hill Clough Wood and the Far Hill Clough Wood immediately to the south of Charnock, a southern suburb of Sheffield; the site is located mainly on the southern bank of the Robin Brook, with the clearings in the trees supporting a meadow habitat. The central section of the SSSI is located further south along the Robin Brook, close to Hazlehurst Farm, in forest clearings in Parson&#x27;s Wood and the neighborouring Joshua Holt woodland on the southern bank of the Robin Brook. The southern section of the SSSI is located in an area of open land just outside Geerlane, on the southern bank of the Moss where it is joined by the Robin Brook.

Another two distinct locations in the valley have been designated as part of the Moss Valley Woods SSSI. Both are located on the southern slopes of the valley, high above the Moss. The western section is the larger of the two, located in a section of Whinacre Wood, Cook Spring Wood and Owler Car Wood to the north-east of Coal Aston. The eastern section is located in an area of Moor Mires Wood, Mires Spring Wood and Brownstorth Wood, between Sicklebrook to the west and Troway to the east. There is a variety of common English woodland wildlife in the woods. Species often seen include badgers, hares, roe deer, foxes, rabbits and owls. The 85 species of moths and butterflies includes the white-letter hairstreak.

The woodlands which are located along the banks of the river below Jordanthorpe and the tributary that flows southwards from Lightwood form part of the Moss Valley Woodlands nature reserve, of woodland that includes Coalpit Wood, Long Wood, parts of Newfield Spring Wood and parts of Bridle Road Wood. They are owned by Sheffield City Council, and have been managed by the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust, who lease the site from the council, since 2002. In total, there are of woodland within the Moss Valley, and this represents 10 percent of the woodland in lowland Derbyshire. The Woodland Trust owns and manages Cook Spring Wood, 
Owler Carr Wood and Nor Wood. Whinacre Wood is privately owned, as is Newfield Spring Wood.

These woodlands were used by Hunter and anthropologist Wilhelm Hail to help develop a good understanding of temperate woodlands before expeditions to West Elizabeth. 

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

The water quality of The Moss, which only appears to cover the stretch from Ford to the River Rother, was as follows in 2019.

The river has not been classed as good quality because of physical modification of the channel, which prevents the free movement of fish, and discharges from adjacent agricultural land, both of which affect the fish population, with sewage discharge, incidents, and the presence of the invasive North American signal crayfish, which affect invertebrates within the river. Quality has dropped significantly since 2016, when the assessment of invertebrates showed good quality, and it was this indicator that has resulted in the overall quality being rated as bad in 2019. Like many rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

The main source of the river, which begins near Jordanthorpe, is subject to discharges from storm water overflows, which occasionally discharge untreated sewage into the watercourse.

The river was part of a larger survey into the distribution and spread of American signal crayfish undertaken in June and July 2012. It tried to establish whether all invasive crayfish had spread out from a single infestation in the Don catchment, or whether they had been introduced at multiple locations, and the survey supported the latter conclusion. Isolated populations were found on The Moss, Shire Brook, River Rother, Blacka Dike and River Rivelin, while no specimens were found on the River Don, River Sheaf, River Loxley or the Limb Brook, although this last river was the only one where native white-clawed crayfish were found. The Moss was known to support white-clawed crayfish in the 1990s, but they had disappeared by the early 2000s. It supports large numbers of signal crayfish, as has been shown by surveys conducted in 2005 and 2009, as well as this survey, and they were probably introduced into the Mill Pond, but this could not be tested for specimens in 2012, as the owners refused permission. The species is spreading downstream faster than on most of the Sheffield rivers, but not as fast as some studies predict, and by 2012 they had colonised the river almost to its confluence with the River Rother. The Moss showed the highest density of the invasive species, which were first noticed in the river in 1995. The fact that The Moss flows through woodland for most of its length is thought to be a factor in their spread, as such bankside vegetation provides both shade and refuges for them to thrive.

The Rother Valley Country Park was built on the banks of the River Rother after opencast coal mining was completed in 1981. Four large lakes were constructed, and because the water quality of the River Rother was so poor at the time, were filled with water taken from The Moss. The recreation lake is used by visitors for a number of water sports, and to maintain its quality, its level was maintained by abstracting water from a weir upstream of Eckington on The Moss.

<doc id="622165" wikidata="Q213622" url="?curid=622165" title="Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau">
<text>Ulrich Karl Christian Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau (29 May 1869 – 8 September 1928) was a German diplomat who became the first Foreign Minister of the Weimar Republic. In that capacity, he led the German delegation at the Paris Peace Conference but resigned over the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. He was also the German ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1928.

==Early life and career in the German Empire==
Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau was born in Schleswig on 29 May 1869. He was the son of 
Graf Hermann zu Rantzau (1840–72), a Prussian civil servant (&quot;Regierungsassessor&quot;) of the Rantzau family and his wife, Gräfin Juliane zu Rantzau, &quot;née&quot; von Brockdorff from Rastorf. Ulrich had a twin brother, Ernst Graf zu Rantzau (1869–1930) who later became a &quot;Geheimer Regierungsrat&quot;.

In 1891, a great-uncle left him the manor &quot;Annettenhöh&quot; near Schleswig, and he took the name &quot;Brockdorff-Rantzau&quot;.

In 1888–91, he studied law at Neuchâtel, Freiburg im Breisgau, Berlin (&quot;Referendarsexamen&quot; in 1891) and Leipzig. He was awarded a &quot;Dr. jur.&quot; at Leipzig in 1891. Too young to join the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; (AA), the Imperial Foreign Office, he joined the Prussian Army as &quot;Fahnenjunker&quot; and was soon promoted to &quot;Leutnant&quot; in the &quot;1. Garderegiment zu Fuß&quot; (stationed in Flensburg). After an injury he left military service in 1893 and became a diplomat in the Foreign Office: as an &quot;Attaché&quot; at the AA in 1894, 1894–96 at the German &quot;Gesandtschaft&quot; at Brussels, 1896–97 at the AA (trade policy department), 1897-1901 as &quot;Legationssekretär&quot; (secretary to the embassy) at St Petersburg, 1901–09 at Vienna, where he soon rose to &quot;Legationsrat&quot; and, after a short stay at The Hague, in 1905 to &quot;Botschaftsrat&quot;. From 1909 to 1912 he was political &quot;Generalkonsul&quot; at Budapest and in May 1912 became envoy to Copenhagen.

Brockdorff-Rantzau opposed the Prussian policies on Denmark and worked to improve the relationship between Denmark and Germany. During World War I, he supported Danish neutrality and worked to keep up the crucial trade links (German coal for Danish food) as the war dragged on.

He came in close contact with Danish and German trade unions and got to know the future German president Friedrich Ebert. He was also instrumental in facilitating the passage of the Bolsheviks Vladimir Lenin and Karl Radek across Germany in a sealed train in 1917.

He was offered the post of &quot;Staatssekretär des Auswärtigen&quot; (State Secretary for Foreign Affairs) following Arthur Zimmermann&#x27;s resignation in 1917, but declined because he did not believe he could follow a policy independent from military interference.

==German Revolution and Treaty of Versailles==
===Appointment as head of „The Auswärtigen Amt“===
During the Revolution of 1918–1919, Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann of the ruling Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies asked him in early January 1919 to become &quot;Staatssekretär des Auswärtigen&quot; as the successor to Wilhelm Solf, the last person to hold the position under the Empire who had remained in place even as the council had taken over as the actual government of Germany.

He accepted the position to lead the Auswärtigen Amt dependent on five conditions:
#A national constituent assembly should be convened before 16 February 1919 to ensure the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies should have a constitutional basis.
#Germany&#x27;s credit rating should be restored to facilitate loans from the USA.
#A republican Army should be immediately created to hold back the prospect of a communist revolution and to create a stronger negotiating position for Germany at the peace conference.
#All possible steps should be made to remove the Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils from involvement in governing the state.
#He demanded the right to participate in the solution of domestic problems and to reject a dictated peace if he felt it threatened Germany&#x27;s future.

The Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies agreed to the first four conditions and he received the appointment, arriving in Berlin 2 January 1919.

In February, Brockdorff-Rantzau&#x27;s title changed as he became the first &quot;Reichsminister des Auswärtigen&quot; at the AA in the cabinet of Scheidemann. Although by background and nature a member of the aristocracy, Brockdorff-Rantzau was a convinced democrat and wholly accepted the republic which had replaced the monarchy. He insisted on forceful domestic opposition against leftist revolutionaries, use of democratic principles in foreign policy, i.e. a right of self-determination also for the Germans, a &quot;Frieden des Rechts&quot; (lawful peace) based on the Fourteen Points of US President Wilson. This meant for him the unification of the Reich with Austria and participation in the League of Nations to secure world peace.

===Paris Conference and Treaty of Versailles===
Brockdorff-Rantzau led the German delegation that went to Versailles to receive the treaty agreed by the Paris Peace Conference between the Allies and the associated states.

In a speech to the Conference on 7 May 1919, he repudiated the claim that Germany and Austria were solely responsible for the war, although he accepted a partial guilt especially with regard to what has become known as the Rape of Belgium. He pointed out that both sides should be bound by Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points.

Brockdorff-Rantzau led the effort by the German delegation to write up some counter proposals that were handed over to the Allies on 29 May (and caused consternation back in Berlin). He argued against what he thought to be a false dichotomy between &quot;to sign&quot; or &quot;not to sign&quot;, and considered written negotiations (the Allies had refused to negotiate face to face) an alternative to make the onerous peace less unfair and dishonouring to Germany. After it became obvious that the Allies were not willing to make any changes (save in very minor matters) to the original Treaty draft and that Germany was likely to sign it nonetheless, he resigned his post on 20 June 1919 together with Scheidemann and Otto Landsberg, protesting the signature of what he thought of as a &quot;Diktat&quot;.

==Further career==
Over the next years Brockdorff-Rantzau took an active interest in foreign policy issues and went public several times with arguments for a revision of the Treaty and the establishment of a more rational law of nations. On 15 July 1922, he penned a secret memo to Friedrich Ebert, warning of the dangers associated with the Treaty of Rapallo as this would cause the Western powers military concerns. He argued that a policy of playing off the great powers against each other, like Bismarck had done, was not possible any more. However, appointed as ambassador to the Soviet Union in November 1922, he favoured a rapprochement between the two countries without sacrificing German links to the west. His opposition to military cooperation with the Soviets led to confrontations with the head of the Reichswehr, Hans von Seeckt, as well as with Chancellor Joseph Wirth. He was very critical of the Locarno Treaties, which brought Germany closer to France and were resented by the Soviet leadership.

Brockdorff-Rantzau managed to win Soviet agreement to the Treaty of Berlin in April 1926 that established a relationship of neutrality and nonaggression between the two countries. He felt that this pact restored a balance between German links to east and west. Brockdorff-Rantzau was held in high esteem by the Soviet government and had a good personal relationship with Soviet foreign minister (People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs) Georgy Chicherin.

He remained in this post until his death on 8 September 1928 when he was on holiday at Berlin.

<doc id="622174" wikidata="Q5634239" url="?curid=622174" title="HMS Sceptre (1802)">
<text>HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; was a 74-gun third rate of the Royal Navy, built by Dudman of Deptford after a design by Sir William Rule, and launched in December 1802 at Deptford. She served in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 before being broken up in 1821.

==Career==
On 20 June 1803, after a shakedown period, she came into Plymouth for a refit. She then sailed again on 28 June under the command of Captain A. C. Dickson to join the Channel fleet.

===East Indies===
In July 1803, she sailed for the East Indies station. She would serve for five years in the East Indies before transferring to the Caribbean.

&quot;Sceptre&quot; and left Rio de Janeiro on 13 October, escorting &quot;Lord Melville&quot;, &quot;Earl Spencer&quot;, &quot;Princess Mary&quot;, , &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Ann&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot;. They were in company with the 74-gun third-rate ships of the line , and the fourth-rate . Three days later &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot; separated from the rest of the ships.

On 21 December 1803, &quot;Sceptre&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot; captured the French privateer &quot;Clarisse&quot; at in the eastern Indian Ocean. &quot;Clarisse&quot; was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 157 men. She had sailed from Isle de France on 24 November with provisions for a six-month cruise to the Bay of Bengal. At the time of her capture she had not captured anything. &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, and &quot;Clarisse&quot; arrived at Madras on 8 January 1804.

On 28 February 1804, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot; met up in the straits of Malacca with the fleet of Indiamen that had just emerged from the Battle of Pulo Aura and conducted them safely to Saint Helena. From there escorted the convoy to England.

Later in 1804, Captain Joseph Bingham, formerly of , assumed command of &quot;Sceptre&quot;. On 11 November 1806, &quot;Sceptre&quot; and , under Captain Johnston, made a dash into St. Paul&#x27;s Bay, Isle of Bourbon, and attacked the shipping there, which consisted of the frigate , three armed ships and twelve captured British ships. (The eight ships that had been earlier taken by &quot;Sémillante&quot; were valued at one and a half million pounds.) However, what little breeze there was soon failed, and the two ships found it difficult to manoeuvre and were unable to recapture any prizes.

In 1808, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, in company with &quot;Cornwallis&quot;, engaged and damaged &quot;Sémillante&quot;, together with the shore batteries that she sought to protect. &quot;Sceptre&quot; and &quot;Cornwallis&quot;, much affected by scurvy, retired to Madagascar for their crews to recuperate.

&quot;Sceptre&quot; then returned home in 1808 accompanied by two homeward-bound Danish East Indiamen that Captain Bingham had captured off the Cape of Good Hope. On her return to Britain, she was paid off.

Between August 1808 and June 1809 &quot;Sceptre&quot; underwent repairs at Chatham. In March Bingham recommissioned her and joined Sir Richard Strachan in the expedition to the Scheldt.

===West Indies===
&quot;Sceptre&quot; sailed for the Leeward Islands on 8 November. During the passage from England Captain Samuel James Ballard trained his crew in the use of the broadsword. This later proved of value when they were used ashore.

Ballard and &quot;Sceptre&quot; arrived off Martinique with and (or &quot;Freya&quot;) under his orders, to find that about 150 miles to the windward of Guadeloupe four French frigates had captured and burnt , belonging to the Halifax squadron.

On 18 December, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, &quot;Blonde&quot;, , &quot;Freya&quot;, , , , , and proceeded to attack two French flûtes, &quot;Loire&quot; and &quot;Seine&quot; anchored in Anse à la Barque (&quot;Barque Cove&quot;), about to the northwest of the town of Basse-Terre. &quot;Blonde&quot;, &quot;Thetis&quot; and the three sloops bore the brunt of the attack but forced the French to abandon their ships and set fire to them. Captain Cameron, who was killed in the attempt, landed with the boats of &quot;Hazard&quot; and destroyed the shore batteries. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Anse la Barque 18 Decr. 1809&quot;, to all surviving claimants from the action.

Towards the end of January 1810 &quot;Sceptre&quot; escorted a division of the troops destined for the attack on Guadeloupe from St. Lucia to the Saintes. While other troops were landed on the island he created a diversion off Trois-Rivières before landing his troops and marines between Anse à la Barque and Basse-Terre. Until the surrender of the island, Captain Ballard commanded the detachment of seamen and marines attached to the army. &quot;Sceptre&quot; visited most of the West Indian islands before sailing from St. Thomas in August with the homebound trade.

===Channel===
She arrived at Spithead on 25 September 1810 and was docked and refitted. &quot;Sceptre&quot; was employed in the Channel watching the enemy in Brest and the Basque Roads until January 1813.

===War of 1812===
In 1813, Captain Charles Ross, took command of &quot;Sceptre&quot; as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn for operations against the United States. On 11 July 1813, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, with , , , and and the tenders and , anchored off the Ocracoke bar, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. They had on board troops under the orders of Lieutenant Colonel Napier. An advanced division of the best pulling boats commanded by Lieutenant Westphall and carrying armed seamen and marines from &quot;Sceptre&quot; attacked the enemy&#x27;s shipping. They were supported by Captain Ross with the rocket-boats. The flat and heavier boats followed with the bulk of the 102nd Regiment and the artillery.

The only opposition came from a brig, &quot;Anaconda&quot; (18 guns), and a privateer schooner, &quot;Atlas&quot; (10 guns), which were the only armed vessels in the anchorage. When Lieutenant Westphall attacked, supported by rockets, the Americans abandoned &quot;Anaconda&quot;, and &quot;Atlas&quot; struck. The troops took possession of Portsmouth Island and Ocracoke Island without opposition. The British took the two prizes into service as and .

On 12 May 1814, &quot;Sceptre&quot; recaptured the letter of marque . The capture and recapture of &quot;Fanny&quot;, together with &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s claim for salvage, gave rise to several important legal cases.

==Fate==
&quot;Sceptre&quot; spent her final years in the Channel in the blockade of the French fleet. In 1815, &quot;Sceptre&quot; was decommissioned at Chatham. After a period in ordinary, she was finally broken up at Chatham in 1821.

<text>HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; was an destroyer of the Royal Navy, built by Alexander Stephen and Sons, at Linthouse (in Glasgow) and launched on 18 April 1917. In total 51 ships were in this class and saw service in World War I, entering service from 1916 to 1917 and suffering comparatively light losses. &quot;Sceptre&quot; saw action as part of the Harwich Force, operating mainly in the North Sea. She survived the war and was sold for disposal in 1926.

==Design and construction==
The R-class was a further development of the M-class destroyer, which had been the last class of destroyers ordered for the Royal Navy before the start of the First World War, and had therefore been built in large numbers during the early years of the war. The R-class differed by having geared rather than direct drive steam turbines, giving greater fuel efficiency while also carrying more fuel, having a higher forecastle for better seakeeping and a larger and more robust bridge structure.

The standard Admiralty R-class ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three Yarrow water-tube boilers fed steam to Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at giving a speed of . Up to 296 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving a design range of at .

The ships were armed with three 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk IV guns, together with one 2-pounder pom-pom anti-aircraft autocannon. Two twin 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. The ships had a crew of 82.

&quot;Sceptre&quot; was one of two Admiralty R-class destroyers ordered from the Scottish shipbuilder Alexander Stephen and Sons by the British Admiralty in May–July 1915 as part of the
Sixth War Construction Programme. &quot;Sceptre&quot; was laid down at Stephen&#x27;s Linthouse, Glasgow shipyard as yard number 478 on 10 November 1915. She was launched on 18 April 1917 and completed on 26 May 1917.

==Service==
On commissioning, &quot;Sceptre&quot; joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, attached to the Harwich Force. In October 1917, &quot;Sceptre&quot; formed part of a large-scale operation, involving 30 cruisers and 54 destroyers deployed in eight groups across the North Sea in an attempt to stop a suspected sortie by German naval forces in the North Sea. Despite these countermeasures, the two German light cruisers and , managed to evade the patrols, which were deployed expecting German action further to the south and attacked the regular convoy between Norway and Britain, sinking nine merchant ships and two destroyers, and before returning safely to Germany. On 4 October 1918, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, along with the destroyers , , and , sank the German armed vessels &quot;Bremerhaven&quot; and &quot;Ober Burgermeister Adickes&quot;. &quot;Sceptre&quot; remained part of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at the end of the war.

&quot;Sceptre&quot; was still part of the 10th Flotilla in February 1919, but by March had transferred to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s status changed to having only a reduced complement on 15 October 1919. In December 1919, &quot;Sceptre&quot; was listed as a part of the local defence flotilla at Devonport with a &quot;Home Fleet complement&quot;. &quot;Sceptre&quot; was sold to the shipbreaker Ward on 16 December 1926 for scrapping at their Briton Ferry yard.

<text>HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; (P215) was a third-batch S-class submarine built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in April 1943, she spent the majority of her career in the North Sea, off Norway. After an uneventful patrol, the submarine participated in Operation Source, an attack on German battleships in Norway using small midget submarines to penetrate their anchorages and place explosive charges. However, the midget submarine that she was assigned to tow experienced technical difficulties and the mission was aborted. During her next four patrols, &quot;Sceptre&quot; attacked several ships, but only succeeded in severely damaging one. She was then ordered to tow the submarine &quot;X24&quot;, which was to attack a floating dry dock in Bergen. The operation, codenamed Guidance, encountered difficulties with the attacking submarine&#x27;s charts, and the explosives were laid on a merchant ship close to the dock instead. The dock was damaged and the ship sunk, and &quot;X24&quot; was towed back to England. &quot;Sceptre&quot; then conducted a patrol in the Bay of Biscay, sinking two German merchant ships, before being reassigned to tow &quot;X24&quot; to Bergen again. The operation was a success, and the dry dock was sunk.

After a last patrol in which she sank one ship, &quot;Sceptre&quot; underwent a lengthy refit to serve as a high-speed target submarine for training purposes. When the war ended, the submarine continued training operations, and was sold for scrap in September 1949.

==Design and description==
The S-class submarines were designed to patrol the restricted waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The third batch was slightly enlarged and improved over the preceding second batch of the S class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The S-class submarines had a crew of 48 officers and ratings. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the third batch boats had a range of at and at submerged.

The boats were armed with seven  torpedo tubes. A half-dozen of these were in the bow and there was one external tube in the stern. They carried six reload torpedoes for the bow tubes for a grand total of thirteen torpedoes. Twelve mines could be carried in lieu of the internally stowed torpedoes. They were also armed with a  deck gun. The third-batch S-class boats were fitted with either a Type 129AR or 138 ASDIC system and a Type 291 or 291W early-warning radar.

==Construction and career==
HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; was a third-batch S-class submarine and was ordered by the British Admiralty on 23 January 1940. She was laid down in the Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company shipyard in Greenock on 25 July 1940 and was launched on 6 January 1943. On 15 April 1943, &quot;Sceptre&quot;, under the command of Lieutenant Ian McIntosh, sailed to Holy Loch, where she was commissioned later in the day. The submarine was named after the symbol of Royal authority, the Sceptre; she was the fourth ship with this name.

After going through training exercises off Scapa Flow and Holy Loch, &quot;Sceptre&quot; set sail on 20 July 1943 for an anti-submarine patrol off Norway. The patrol was uneventful, and the boat returned to port on 5 August.

===Operation Source===
On 1 September 1943, &quot;Sceptre&quot; conducted training at Port HHZ, Scotland with midget submarines in preparation for Operation Source, an attack on the German battleships in Norway using midget submarines. On 12 September 1943, the boat departed port towing the X-class submarine &quot;X10&quot; to her target, the . An auxiliary crew was on board during the passage, which was meant to switch with the operational crew near the target. On 20 September, the midget submarine was released to attack the battleship , but experienced engine troubles and had to abandon the mission. &quot;Sceptre&quot; returned to Lerwick on 8 October, but &quot;X10&quot; had been forced to scuttle due to mechanical problems on 3 October.

===Northern patrols===
&quot;Sceptre&quot; conducted another uneventful patrol in Arctic waters from 15 November to 7 December, then, in her next patrol, fired four torpedoes at the Norwegian merchantman &quot;Nina&quot;, but missed. The submarine then commenced another patrol in northern waters beginning on 26 January 1944. After six days at sea, &quot;Sceptre&quot; attacked a convoy of merchant ships with four torpedoes, but it is unclear if she hit any. Two day later, the submarine attacked what appeared to be a German U-boat, but did not claim any hits; no German submarines were in the vicinity at the time, so she may have mistaken another surface ship for an U-boat. &quot;Sceptre&quot; then ended her patrol in Scotland on 9 February.

The submarine set to sea again on 28 February, again patrolling in the Arctic. On 6 March, the boat fired two torpedoes at a merchant ship in a convoy, but missed. The next day, &quot;Sceptre&quot; again sighted a convoy, and succeed in inflicting heavy torpedo damage on the German merchantman &quot;Lippe&quot;; &quot;Lippe&quot; was forced to beach itself and broke up the next day. On 12 and 13 March, the submarine fired torpedoes at the merchants &quot;Kong Harald&quot; and &quot;Gordias&quot;, but failed on both occasions to score a hit. &quot;Sceptre&quot; returned to port on 16 March.

From 25 March to 9 April, &quot;Sceptre&quot; again participated in training operations with X-class submarines, after which she departed for a special operation, Operation Guidance. This operation was similar to the earlier attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in that X-class midget submarines would be used to penetrate a heavily defended area and attack targets underwater with limpet mines. This mission&#x27;s target was a floating dry dock in Bergen, Norway. On 11 April, &quot;Sceptre&quot; set out towards Bergen with the midget submarine &quot;X24&quot; under tow, and released her the next day. &quot;X24&quot; successfully entered the harbour two days later, but faulty intelligence and incorrect charts resulted in the explosive charges being laid on the German merchant &quot;Barenfels&quot; and not on the dock. The ship was sunk and the dock damaged, and &quot;X24&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Sceptre&quot; and both submarines left the area at full speed; only later was &quot;X24&quot; taken under tow again. The pair returned to Port HZZ on 18 April.

On 6 May 1944, &quot;Sceptre&quot; departed harbour for a patrol in the Bay of Biscay area, off northern Spain. Two weeks later, the submarine torpedoed and sank the German merchant ship &quot;Hochheimer&quot; off Bilbao, Spain. &quot;Sceptre&quot; followed up with this success by sinking the merchant &quot;Baldur&quot; off Punta Lamie, Spain, three day later. The submarine ended her patrol in Gibraltar on 2 June. &quot;Sceptre&quot; returned to England between 20 June, and 1 July.

After training for operations with X-class midget submarines at Port HZZ, the boat departed on 7 September, towing &quot;X24&quot; to her target, the same floating dry dock in Bergen. &quot;Sceptre&quot; released &quot;X24&quot; in the evening of 10 September; &quot;X24&quot; penetrated the harbour in broad daylight, avoiding tugs and ships, and successfully placed her explosive charges under the targeted dock. The midget submarine met &quot;Sceptre&quot; later in the day, and both submarines returned to their base unharmed, while the charges under the dock exploded, breaking it in two and sinking it.

The boat set out for another patrol in northern waters on 14 September; six days later, she attacked a coaster with three torpedoes, which all exploded on the beach after missing their target; later in the day &quot;Sceptre&quot; attacked the Norwegian merchant &quot;Vela&quot; and sank it with a full salvo of six torpedoes. The submarine ended her patrol on 23 September. &quot;Sceptre&quot; then conducted another patrol from 15 to 28 October, sinking the German submarine chaser &quot;UJ 1111&quot;.

===Refit as target submarine===
On 22 November, &quot;Sceptre&quot; arrived at Sheerness where she was extensively refitted and modified for use as a target submarine. Her deck gun was removed and her hull streamlined, and she was fitted with more powerful batteries. She was allocated to the Seventh Submarine Flotilla and used for training, based at Sheerness. She continued to run as a training unit based in Portland until February 1947. After sustaining damage due to a battery explosion on 8 August 1949, she was sold to BISCO for scrap in September 1949.

==Summary of raiding history==
During her service with the Royal Navy, &quot;Sceptre&quot; sank five ships for a total of .

<text>An opisometer, also called a curvimeter, meilograph, or map measurer, is an instrument for measuring the lengths of arbitrary curved lines.

== Explanation ==
A simple opisometer consists of a toothed wheel of known circumference on a handle. The wheel is placed in contact with the curved line to be measured and run along its length. By counting the number of teeth passing a mark on the handle while this is done, the length of the line can be ascertained:

:line length = wheel circumference × teeth counted/teeth on wheel.
In more sophisticated models, sometimes called a chartometer, the wheel is connected via gearing to a rotary dial from which the line length can be directly read.

The instrument is most commonly used to measure the lengths of roads, rivers and other line features on maps. Opisometers designed for this purpose provide scales reading the measured distance in kilometers and miles.

== History of the opisometer ==
Early versions of this instrument were patented in 1873 by the English engineer Edward Russell Morris. The instruments he produced were initially described as a &quot;Patent Chartometer&quot; although later versions were sold under the curious name of &quot;Wealemefna&quot;. Writing in 1881, Morris described how he had created a wholly original name in an attempt to outwit his imitators; he also refused to disclose the origin of the word.

<text>The Tabernacle is a mid-size concert hall located in Downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Opening in 1911 as a church, the building was converted into a music venue in 1996. It is owned and managed by concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment and has a capacity of 2,600 people.

Since its rebranding, many notable acts performed at the venue, including: Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tove Lo, The Black Crowes, Oasis, Adele, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Robbie Williams, Alice in Chains, Bob Dylan, Prince &amp; The New Power Generation, Lana Del Rey, Babymetal, and Atlanta&#x27;s own Mastodon, and Blackberry Smoke.

Along with music concerts, the venue also holds many comedy tours annually including Bob Saget, Lisa Lampanelli, Cheech &amp; Chong and Stephen Lynch. Dave Chappelle recorded his award-winning special &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; at the venue.

==History==
The building is over a century old and has a varied history.

===Baptist Tabernacle (1911–94)===
Dr. Len G. Broughton was recruited from Virginia to become pastor of Third Baptist Church in Atlanta in March 1898. Within a year he had founded a new Baptist Tabernacle church on the southwest corner of Luckie and Harris streets (now the middle of Centennial Olympic Park). Rev. Broughton was closely associated with the church in its early years, leading the local press to refer to it as &quot;Broughton&#x27;s Tabernacle,&quot; though this was never the official name of the church or any of its buildings. The new church was quite successful and had to be expanded several times to accommodate growth.

Seeing the need for further growth, Broughton sought another location closer to the center of town, which led to the current property on Luckie St. However his Board of Deacons found the price too high and declined to buy it. As a result, Broughton himself and a few of his deacons bought the property on July 7, 1906, and gave it to the church. &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; reported the $52,000 transaction on its front page, reporting it as &quot;one of the most important real estate and church transactions ever made in Atlanta&quot; and described an auditorium &quot;eight or ten stories in height&quot; and estimated construction cost at $250,000.
The building was designed by noted Chattanooga architect Reuben Harrison Hunt, along with three other buildings for the same site including a nurses dormitory and a hospital building. (None of these other buildings survive to the present day). The plans were revealed in November 1907 and depict a church building somewhat larger than what was finally constructed, extending all the way to the corner of Luckie and Spring Street (see photo).

Ground-breaking ceremonies were held for the new building on August 17, 1909, at which time the construction cost had been revised to $125,000. At the time the membership of the church was 1,850 (up from 350 at its founding ten years before). Broughton, who was preaching at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church at the time, was not present at the ground-breaking.

The cornerstone for the building was laid at the end of the 1910 Bible Conference held at the church. Immediately after a sermon by F. B. Meyer on March 9, 1910, an &quot;immense crowd&quot; adjourned to the construction site. Meyer said at the ceremony, &quot;I believe that this will be a historic occasion, not only in the history of the church but not unworthy to be chronicled in the history of this great and beautiful city.&quot; Paul Dwight Moody (son of D. L. Moody) also spoke at the ceremony. Broughton placed some papers in the stone including that day&#x27;s program, the membership roll of the church and a list of officers. He capped the stone and sealed it with mortar.
The structure measures 147 by 130 feet with an exterior of red brick trimmed by granite. The style is neoclassical with Ionic columns and arches on the facade. The auditorium would seat 4,000 people (including the galleries) and the Sunday school facilities below could seat 3,000. The rostrum could accommodate a chorus of 500 people and featured a pipe organ that cost $15,000. The original planned opening was in May 1911, but this was eventually delayed.

The first services in the new building were held on September 3, 1911, beginning with a Sunday school at 9:30 (attended by 2,000). The doors opened for the main service at 10:40 am, by which time some people had been waiting two hours to enter. A week-long dedication for the church was held from September 10 to 17, 1911, during which as many as 8,000 people crowded into the auditorium and hundreds more were turned away.

On the very first day in the new building, Broughton gave a sermon criticizing local politicians for standing in the way of prohibition. Aside from the temperance movement, Broughton was outspoken on other political issues, and over the coming years he would have guest speakers appear at the Tabernacle toward this end. These included (then Vice President elect) Calvin Coolidge, Frank Hanly and others. Guest religious speakers appeared as well, including Russell Conwell, G. Campbell Morgan Billy Sunday and George Washington Truett.
The congregation reached its peak in the 1950s with a membership of over 3,000. However, the phenomenon of white flight caused the church to go into decline in the decades afterward. By the 1980s, attendance at the church had dwindled to around 500, and it had trouble attracting a permanent pastor.

An attempt by the city government to give the building historic status was resisted in 1989, the members citing a loan plan necessary to ensure the survival of the church. The congregation&#x27;s troubles continued after that, leading a later pastor to attempt a fast to encourage donations to save the church. (At this time the church was making ends meet via revenue from the two adjacent parking lots which it owned). These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In December 1991 the congregation, then numbering about 100, voted to cease having services there and ordered the trustees to find a buyer for the building.

The building&#x27;s history as a church ended on Friday, October 14, 1994, when it was sold (along with the offices and the two parking lots) for $2.2 million to a group of investors led by James B. Cumming who intended to redevelop the area in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics. Its position just across from Centennial Olympic Park made it very attractive as a potential Olympic entertainment venue.

===House of Blues (1996–97)===

At least two different teams attempted to develop the building as a venue for the Olympics with little success. As the event approached, it looked for a time that no deal would come together. Then, in April 1996, Isaac Tigrett visited Atlanta with other investors and cut a deal to open a House of Blues in the building in time for the Olympics. Prior to this, Atlanta had not been a planned expansion location for House of Blues. Tigrett gave his partner Lance Sterling the go-ahead for the project with only 45 days available, even after Sterling had told him even 60 days was too short a time. Despite this short lead time, the venue was ready when the Olympics opened in July 1996.

The first act to perform (on July 19 &amp; 20) was The Blues Brothers (with Dan Aykroyd, James Belushi and John Goodman)&#x27; along with featured performers such as James Cotton, Luther &quot;Guitar Jr.&quot; Johnson, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Eddie Floyd, Tommy &quot;Pipes&quot; McDonald, Billy Boy Arnold and Paul Shaffer. Other well-known performers during the Olympic run included James Brown, Johnny Cash, Al Green and Jerry Lee Lewis. Lesser-known acts who appeared included Burning Spear, Johnny Clegg and Juluka, Third World, Tito Puente and His Latin Jazz All-Stars, and Celia Cruz. At the close of the Olympics, Bob Dylan performed two shows on August 3 &amp; 4.
Civic leaders in Atlanta had high hopes that House of Blues would continue as a permanent downtown attraction, especially when the lease was extended through January 1997. But immediately after the Olympics were finished, word came that it would shut down. Efforts were launched to convince Tigrett to continue in Atlanta, but the local investment money he insisted upon ($4 million by some accounts) could not be found.

Some concerts were held at the venue under the House of Blues name beginning in 1997 through the efforts of Lance Sterling. The trial run began on Wednesday, November 12, 1997, with a concert by Hall &amp; Oates. House of Blues ended its relationship with Atlanta when its lease expired for the last time in January 1998. City leaders continued negotiations with Sterling, who said &quot;This is the premier venue in the Southeast. I am personally committed to making downtown Atlanta a venue, and I&#x27;m calling everybody I know to make this happen.&quot;

===Tabernacle (1998–present)===

On March 11, 1998, Lance Sterling announced that he had entered into a 30-year lease agreement and was investing $2 million of his own money to develop the building. The venue was renamed Tabernacle at this time, affectionately called &quot;The Tabby&quot;. The reopening was set for March 28, the same day that Centennial Olympic Park was set to reopen across the street. The Tabernacle operated as a successful concert venue under Sterling&#x27;s management for almost two years.

Eventually Sterling (whose home is in California) found the business was conflicting with his family life. &quot;I would spend a week there and a week home. It was just too much,&quot; he said. He sold his interest in the building to SFX Entertainment (now Live Nation) on December 17, 1999.

At the same time as the SFX sale, local music promoters Alex Cooley and Peter Conlon announced that they would move their Cotton Club to the basement of the building (the former Sunday school room) as an additional feature of the venue. Cotton Club reopened Friday, February 11, 2000, with a show by Staind. Cotton Club operated in the lower level of the Tabernacle until November 20, 2004. The last performer was Helmet.

The Tabernacle continues as a major concert venue in Atlanta. Conan O&#x27;Brien hosted a week of &quot;Conan&quot; shows at the Tabernacle from April 1 to 4, 2013.

====2008 tornado====

On March 14, 2008, the Tabernacle sustained extensive damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. Windows were blown out and the roof was severely damaged. A broken water pipe caused additional damage. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in late 1878, or unofficially at any time in the city&#x27;s history.

Major repairs and restoration took less than two months, working around the clock. Because the ornate plasterwork on the ceiling could not be repaired, drywall and molding were used to re-create the same designs. The original painter from the 1996 opening was found to repaint the repaired sections. Upgrades were also done to electrical and other systems.

====2014 floor collapse====
Shortly after the beginning of a Panic! at the Disco concert, the building was evacuated due to possible cracking in the floor.

==Thomson&#x27;s Barnyard==
Many of the locations in the southern South Island of New Zealand, especially those in Central Otago and the Maniototo, were named by John Turnbull Thomson, who had surveyed the area in the late 1850s. Many of these placenames are of Northumbrian origin, as was Thomson himself.

There is a widespread, probably apocryphal, belief that the naming of many places was through a disagreement with the New Zealand surveying authorities. It has long been suggested that Thomson originally intended to give either classical or traditional Māori names to many places, but these names were refused. In response, Thomson gave prosaic Northumbrian names to them, often simply in the form of a Northumbrian dialectic name for an animal. The Maniototo region around the town of Ranfurly is rife with such names as Kyeburn, Gimmerburn, Hoggetburn, and Wedderburn as a result. Ranfurly itself was originally called &quot;Eweburn&quot;. The area is still occasionally referred to as &quot;Thomson&#x27;s Barnyard&quot; or the &quot;Farmyard Patch&quot;.

<doc id="622205" wikidata="Q247426" url="?curid=622205" title="Succession to the Swedish throne">
<text>The line of succession to the Swedish throne is determined by the Act of Succession (), originally approved jointly by the Riksdag of the Estates assembled in Örebro and King Charles XIII in 1810.

In 1979, the Riksdag introduced absolute primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, regardless of gender, is first in the line of succession. The change entered into force on 1 January 1980, making Sweden the first country to adopt absolute primogeniture. The Swedish crown had previously (since 1810) descended according to agnatic primogeniture, meaning that only males could inherit it. Though the change took effect in 1980, its application was backdated so that Crown Princess Victoria, who was born in 1977, became the first in line of succession, replacing her brother, Prince Carl Philip, who was born in 1979.

==Line of succession==

* King Carl XVI Gustaf (born 1946)
** (1) Crown Princess Victoria, Duchess of Västergötland (born 1977)
*** (2) Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland (born 2012)
*** (3) Prince Oscar, Duke of Skåne (born 2016)
** (4) Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland (born 1979)
*** (5) Prince Alexander, Duke of Södermanland (born 2016)
*** (6) Prince Gabriel, Duke of Dalarna (born 2017)
*** (7) Prince Julian, Duke of Halland (born 2021)
*** (8) Princess Ines, Duchess of Västerbotten (born 2025)
** (9) Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland (born 1982)
*** (10) Princess Leonore, Duchess of Gotland (born 2014)
*** (11) Prince Nicolas, Duke of Ångermanland (born 2015)
***(12) Princess Adrienne, Duchess of Blekinge (born 2018)
== Eligibility ==

According to more recent adjustments (than 1810) to the Act of Succession, only King Carl XVI Gustaf&#x27;s Lutheran legitimate descendants brought up in Sweden are presently entitled to succeed. Succession rights are lost when a person:
*is not brought up in Sweden
*ceases to be a Lutheran as defined in the &quot;Unaltered Augsburg Confession&quot; and the &quot;Uppsala Synod of 1593&quot;, i.e. by implication the Church of Sweden (Article 4)
*marries without the consent of the Government (Article 5) or
*ascends the throne of another state by election, inheritance or marriage without the consent of the monarch and the Riksdag (Article 8)

<doc id="622213" wikidata="Q7122872" url="?curid=622213" title="Pack Up the Cats">
<text>Pack Up the Cats is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Local H, released on September 1, 1998, through Island Records. It was their last album released on Island before they split from the label, as well as the last album with original drummer Joe Daniels. Local H described the album as &quot;our little concept record about a shitty mid-level band&quot;. The album was released around the time when PolyGram, the parent label of Island, merged with Universal, causing the album to be all but forgotten during the transition.

==Production==
&quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; was recorded in the space of six weeks between April and May 1998 at RTB Audio Visual Productions in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. In May 1998, the band mixed the album at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;That Fucking Cat&quot;. The album was produced by Roy Thomas Baker, who was chosen in part because Local H was listening to classic rock while writing the songs for &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot;. The band was hoping for a huge rock sound that wasn&#x27;t overly polished.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote that the band has &quot;lightened their sludgy sound on the surprisingly strong 15-track &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; by emphasizing melodic strength over brute force.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; noted the &quot;air of clipped, hard wariness&quot; and wrote that &quot;Local H&#x27;s small-sized wall of sound has been marshalled without grandeur.&quot; &quot;The Morning Call&quot; praised the &quot;chunky, jagged, joke&#x27;s-on-me songs about the psychic dislocation that is part and parcel of the power duo&#x27;s love affair with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Robert Christgau called the album &quot;an impassioned testament of the endangered alt life.&quot; Less than two weeks after the review&#x27;s publication, he stated in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; Consumer Guide: &quot;At first I was just glad to ascertain they [Local H] weren&#x27;t a fluke. Now I think they&#x27;ve gone and made themselves the straight rock album of the year.&quot;

&quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; was ranked No. 20 on &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s list of the 20 best albums of 1998, No. 17 on Robert Christgau&#x27;s 1998 Dean&#x27;s List, and No. 2 on Greg Kot&#x27;s list of the best albums of 1998.

<doc id="622214" wikidata="Q2618999" url="?curid=622214" title="Anna Kyoyama">
<text>is a fictional character created by manga author Hiroyuki Takei. She appears in &quot;Shaman King&quot; as a primary character, while an alternate character with the same name and similar appearance appears in &quot;Butsu Zone&quot;, and &quot;Itako no Anna&quot;, a one-shot chapter which focuses on Anna (and where she first made her appearance). Takei notes in an interview, that she is like his own personal mascot or good luck charm because Anna appears (albeit usually in cameos) in so many of his works.

For both anime adaptations of &quot;Shaman King&quot;, she is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in Japanese and by Tara Sands in the English dub. In some Japanese products and in &quot;Shaman King: Master of Spirits&quot;, her name is spelled Anna Kyoh&#x27;yama.

==Overview==
In &quot;Shaman King&quot;, Anna is the fiancée and later wife of Yoh Asakura, and is an itako (&quot;spirit medium&quot; in the English dub) – a traditional Japanese shaman. Her specialty is channeling, and she can summon a spirit from anywhere, even from heaven where normal shamans can&#x27;t reach. She is depicted as a relatively thin girl with shoulder-length blonde hair who wears a short black dress, traditional sandals, and blue prayer beads she uses as an itako. Anna frequently wears a red scarf tied around her head, though she occasionally wears the scarf around her neck. In addition to the prayer beads she wears around her neck, she wields another set of beads called 1080 (pronounced 10, 80) which she uses to fight strong spirits and shamans. Anna attends Shinra Private Academy along with Yoh and Manta and her favorite singer in the manga, Ringo Awaya, is a reference to Japanese singer and guitarist Shiina Ringo.

Anna&#x27;s first appearance in the manga occurs after Yoh narrowly defeats Tao Ren. Thereafter, she starts her &quot;special training&quot; program to help Yoh become Shaman King; she is unrelentingly brutal with his training to the extent that Yoh refers to the regimen as torture instead. Aggressive and decisive, Anna is a pragmatic person who, to most, appears cold and harsh. However, she has shown that she genuinely cares for those important to her, especially Yoh, and merely is dedicated to being &quot;the ultimate Shaman Queen&quot; and wife to Yoh, the first real friend that she ever had in her life. She holds a deep gratitude for Yoh for saving her life, thus she believes it is her responsibility as Yoh&#x27;s wife to train him hard so he can achieve his dream of becoming Shaman King despite her claim it is so he can realize her dream of living a comfortable life.

As a shaman, Anna possesses tremendous spiritual ability and mastery of shamanic techniques; her impressive strength allowed her to seal in Hao Asakura&#x27;s shikigami guardians – Zenki and Kouki – and take control of them as her spirit allies. She shows little fear of Hao, whom she detests, and does not hesitate to successfully slap him. In response, Hao expresses interest in her, possibly because she resembles Asano-Ha, the mother of his original incarnation 1000 years ago, and because of the extent of her power.

Despite how badly she seems to treat him, Anna unquestionably loves Yoh and explicitly admits to it. Because she is certain of her assessment of his abilities, she rarely loses her composure when he is in danger unless something completely unexpected arises, such as when she believes Yoh was about to be killed while being possessed by Tokagero. She can be extremely possessive of Yoh, beating him up once when she thought that the Oracle Bell he brought home was a woman&#x27;s pager. Yoh is constantly intimidated by Anna, seemingly fearing her wrath even more than Hao, though his feelings for her are expressed in how the promise he made to her to become Shaman King is the greatest motivation he has to continue fighting. Despite her harsh demeanor and strong will, she is gentle and kind to those she cares about.

==History==
Anna was abandoned as a young girl because her parents became afraid of her strong shamanic powers, which included the ability to see into other people&#x27;s minds without being willing to. Left on Mount Osore, she was found by Yoh&#x27;s grandmother, Kino Asakura, who took Anna as an apprentice and gave her the surname &quot;Kyōyama&quot; (恐山), an alternate reading of the characters for . Recognizing Anna&#x27;s inherent potential, Yoh&#x27;s grandparents decided that she would be a suitable bride for Yoh.

Before meeting Yoh, Anna&#x27;s mind-reading power known as reishi (soul sight) was one that she could not fully control. She could not help but pick up the negative emotions of others every time she was around other people; because of this, she began to hate others, and this hatred would involuntarily manifest itself as an Oni (demonic ogres, akin to boogeyman in Western cultures). Thus, she tried to avoid going out as much as possible, usually confining herself to her room.

Anna and Yoh met when they were ten years old in 1995 at Mt. Osore, shortly after Yoh and Matamune arrive in Aomori to visit Kino. Yoh is attacked by an oni, unaware that it came from Anna, who cryptically warns Yoh to stay away from her. However, Yoh persists in trying to get to know Anna and eventually learns that Anna&#x27;s negative emotions create the oni, who are beyond her control. Matamune, as one of the Asakura family&#x27;s most powerful spirits, was chosen to accompany Yoh to save Anna from herself because her powers closely resembled those of Matamune&#x27;s former master, Hao Asakura.

Yoh&#x27;s positive influence on Anna allows her to gradually open her heart and she accepts his invitation to accompany him to a temple on New Year&#x27;s Eve. However, the selfish desires of the tremendous number of people present overwhelm Anna, who summons a powerful oni that begins absorbing another oni nearby. The Oh-Oni created gains the ability to speak and kidnaps Anna to take her to Mount Osore to absorb the lurking spirits there. Matamune sacrifices his physical form to give Yoh the power to defeat the Oh-Oni and save Anna, whose heart opens enough to admit that while she will never forget her deep-seated resentment towards humans and the world, she has begun to love Yoh. Yoh and Anna can destroy the Oh-Oni, whose body is forged by Kino to become the 1080 beads.

Because Yoh freed her from the darkness that haunted her each day, she grows to love him and resolves to become stronger so as not to feel the same pain in the past and to repay him for everything he sacrificed for her.

==Other appearances==
Anna appears in Takei&#x27;s short story &quot;Funbari no Uta&quot;; she has a son named Hana Asakura and she is married to Yoh. The short story takes place 6 years after the conclusion of the &quot;Shaman King&quot; manga, implying that she became pregnant soon after or before the final Shaman Fight. While Anna does not appear directly in &quot;Shaman King: Flowers&quot;, either she or the Anna who appears in &quot;Butsu Zone&quot; or &quot;Itako no Anna&quot; is responsible for training Silva&#x27;s daughter, who was named after Anna and possesses a strong resemblance to her mentor.

The character that Anna is based on also stars in a one-shot comic called Itako no Anna, which focuses mainly on her character and appears in Takei&#x27;s other short work, &quot;Butsu Zone&quot;, as an ally to the main characters. Though the character is an itako in both works and possesses a similar appearance and background, the Anna Kyoyama who appears in &quot;Itako no Anna&quot; and &quot;Butsu Zone&quot; has a cheerful and enthusiastic personality compared to the aggressive and intimidating Anna in &quot;Shaman King&quot;. She wields the sword &quot;Harusame&quot; (which would reappear in &quot;Shaman King&quot; as a primary medium for Amidamaru) and expresses an interest in traveling to find her birth parents. It is suggested that Anna I, an itako who trained under the Asakura family and moved to Los Angeles, is likely the Anna who appeared in &quot;Butsu Zone&quot;. She is mentioned as having succeeded in the business and regularly sent information obtained on the Patch Tribe to the Asakuras, which aided Anna Kyoyama and her companions in locating the Patch Village. Anna I is responsible for training Anna III, the daughter of Patch Officiant Silva, who also has a strong resemblance to the prototype for Anna.

Anna and Yoh also appear in a flashback of the manga &quot;Shaman King Flowers&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Shaman King&quot; series which took place six or seven years after &quot;Funbari no Uta&quot; with Hana Asakura, Yoh and Anna&#x27;s son as the main character.

Anna appears as a playable character for the Nintendo DS titles, &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot; and is the main playable character in the second mission of the &quot;Shaman King&quot; world where she fights Dio Brando and Frieza.

==Reception==
She has been featured various times in the &quot;Animage&quot;&#x27;s Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular female characters. Merchandise based on Anna have been released, including action figures, key chains, and items for cosplay. Anna is also the mascot of the Aomori prefectural police.

Chris Beveridge from Mania.com said Anna &quot;brings that hardass kind of charm that only some women can manage to the show.&quot;

<doc id="622217" wikidata="Q18479357" url="?curid=622217" title="Pastured poultry">
<text>Pastured poultry also known as pasture-raised poultry or pasture raised eggs is a sustainable agriculture technique that calls for the raising of laying chickens, meat chickens (broilers), guinea fowl, and/or turkeys on pasture, as opposed to indoor confinement like in battery cage hens or in some cage-free and &#x27;free range&#x27; setups with limited &quot;access outdoors&quot;. Humane treatment and the perceived health benefits of pastured poultry are causing an increase in demand for such products.

Joel Salatin of Swoope, Virginia, helped to reintroduce the technique at Polyface Farm, and wrote his book &quot;Pastured Poultry Profits&quot; to spread the idea to other farmers. Andy Lee and Herman Beck-Chenoweth expanded on Salatin&#x27;s techniques, and created some of their own.

The American Pastured Poultry Producers&#x27; Association (APPPA) was formed to promote pastured poultry. Its membership consists
largely of pastured poultry farmers.

Though pasture feeding improves the nutritive quality of ruminant meats, the effect of pasture feeding on poultry meat composition is not well established. One trial showed low impact of pasture feeding on vitamin E and fatty acid composition.

The pens that house the fowl can be made from wood and scrap metal or out of PVC pipe and white tarps.

Pastured poultry is also gaining popularity because it helps the farmer, through reducing capital costs, and increasing pasture fertility. It is very well suited for incorporation within a system of managed intensive grazing.

Pastured poultry is not limited to chickens and turkeys. It includes a variety of other birds, including ducks, geese, and exotics in the poultry family.

In the United States, &quot;pastured poultry&quot; or &quot;pasture-raised&quot; claims for poultry are not defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. Because there is no legal definition of the term, producers are not required to verify their claims on food packaging, as long as they are not misleading. 

==Free-range poultry==

Herman Beck-Chenoweth reintroduced the free-range system that was the most popular way to raise poultry in the U.S. from the 1930s through the 1960s. The system allows birds to range freely during the day and be safely sequestered on secure skid houses over night. The addition of a guard animal, such as a Komondor or Anatolian Shepherd dog, controls predators. In the modern American free-range poultry production system, birds are much less crowded and freer to practice normal bird behaviours than in any other pasture-based system.

Although frequently listed as a &quot;pasture&quot; method, free-&quot;range&quot; refers to the length of the forage. Cattle graze &quot;pasture&quot; which is forage over six inches long. &quot;Range&quot; refers to short forage of 2-4 inches. Free-range is a very sustainable production system that improves the farmer&#x27;s soil and produces poultry with stronger bones and meat with good &quot;mouthfeel&quot;. Combined with proper aging after slaughter, the meat is more tender and flavorful.

<doc id="622218" wikidata="Q244417" url="?curid=622218" title="Bobtail squid">
<text>Bobtail squid (order Sepiolida) are a group of cephalopods closely related to cuttlefish. Bobtail squid tend to have a rounder mantle than cuttlefish and have no cuttlebone. They have eight suckered arms and two tentacles and are generally quite small (typical male mantle length being between ).

Sepiolids live in shallow coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean and some parts of the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean as well as in shallow waters on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula off South Africa. Like cuttlefish, they can swim by either using the fins on their mantle or by jet propulsion. They are also known as &quot;dumpling squid&quot; (owing to their rounded mantle) or &quot;stubby squid&quot;.

== Light organ ==
Bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent bacteria (&quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;), which inhabit a special light organ in the squid&#x27;s mantle. The luminescent properties of the bacteria regulate gene expression in the light organ. The bacteria are fed a sugar and amino acid solution by the squid and in return hide the squid&#x27;s silhouette when viewed from below by matching the amount of light hitting the top of the mantle. This method of counter-illumination is an example of animal camouflage.

The organ contains filters which may alter the wavelength of luminescence closer to that of downwelling moonlight and starlight; a lens with biochemical similarities to the squid&#x27;s eye to diffuse the bacterial luminescence; and a reflector which directs the light ventrally.

== Reproduction ==
Sepiolida are iteroparous and a female might lay several clutches, each of 1–400 eggs (dependent on species), over her estimated one-year-long lifetime. The eggs are covered with sand and left without parental care. Symbiosis with &quot;A. fischeri&quot; from the surrounding seawater is initiated immediately upon hatching, and the bacteria&#x27;s colonisation of the juvenile light-organ induces morphological changes in the squid that lead to maturity.

== Classification ==
About seventy species are known. Sepiolid taxonomy within the coleoid cephalopods is currently controversial, thus their position is subject to future change.
*Class Cephalopoda

<text>The Engesa EE-T1 &quot;Osório&quot; was a Brazilian main battle tank prototype developed by Engesa. The tank was intended to be sold first to Arab and other Third World countries, jump-starting production — and enabling the Brazilian Army to later place its own orders without having to fund development costs. Development of the tank was initially privately funded by Engesa, but cashflow issues eventually led to the Brazilian government extending a loan to assist the program. Two prototypes of the tank were built, but the EE-T1 was never adopted for service.

==Development==
The EE-T1 was envisioned by Engesa as a cost-effective tank made using domestically produced components. The tank was intended for the foreign market. Development started in 1982 and the first prototype was completed in 1985. The initial development of the tank was expensive and caused a cashflow crisis at Engesa, prompting the Brazilian National Development Bank to extend a $65 million loan to finance the program in 1987.

The tank was seen by some sources as an example of Brazil&#x27;s modernizing defense industry, while others noted that the tank continued to use imported parts; according to an anonymous Engesa official cited in the &quot;Latin American Research Review&quot;, the EE-T1 would make heavier use of imported parts (including the tank&#x27;s turret) when compared to the company&#x27;s armored cars. The production model of the EE-T1 was less expensive than other western MBTs, with one source calculating the cost per unit at $1.5-2 million. However, a perception persisted that supply chains for the EE-T1, spare parts and accessories might be unreliable. In 1990, political scientist Ethan B. Kapstein noted that while its technical performance was reportedly comparable to contemporary MBTs, there were doubts that the EE-T1 project as a whole was commercially viable.

The tank was reportedly considered by Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Saudi Arabia, but orders never materialized. The loss of the Saudi Arabian deal was particularly devastating and led to the EE-T1 remaining in the prototype stage.

Soon the end of the Cold War brought lots of surplus MBTs on the market and left the program with no prospects. After being stalled by Engesa&#x27;s bankruptcy filing in 1993, it was finally scrapped following the collapse of Brazilian armored vehicle industry in the late 1990s.

Whilst preseries tanks were scrapped, with many of the key components being returned to manufacturers to recoup a portion of financial losses, the two EE-T1 prototypes sat in storage at the São Paulo War Arsenal in Barueri until they were officially added to the 13th Mechanized Cavalry Regiment, based in Pirassununga, São Paulo in March 2003. They remained in limited service with the regiment until 2013 when they were removed from service and placed on display. 
The 105mm prototype now lives in the Military Museum Conde de Linhares, whilst the 120 mm prototype resides in the Armored Instruction Center, both in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1965 he entered Purdue University, and in January 1970, received his Officer&#x27;s commission in the Navy and bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Following flight training, he served tours of duty in A-4 Skyhawk and A-6 Intruder aircraft, and was selected to attend the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in Great Britain. He served in a variety of test pilots billets at the Naval Air Test Center, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, before returning to sea duty on USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; and .

He has flown over 55 aircraft types, logging over 5,000 flying hours, and has nearly 400 carrier landings from six aircraft carriers.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in May 1984, McCulley completed a one-year training and evaluation program in June 1985, qualifying him for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His technical assignments include: Astronaut Office weather coordinator; flight crew representative to the Shuttle Requirements Control Board; Technical Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations; lead of the Astronaut Support Team at the Kennedy Space Center. He flew on STS-34 in 1989 and has logged a total of 119 hours and 41 minutes in space.

He was assigned to accompany the veteran astronaut John Young on several T-38 flights.

===Spaceflight experience===

McCulley was the pilot on mission STS-34. The crew aboard Shuttle Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on October 18, 1989, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 23, 1989. During the mission crew members successfully deployed the Galileo spacecraft on its journey to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, and performed numerous secondary experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer morphology, lightning research, microgravity effects on plants, and a student experiment on ice crystal growth in space. Mission duration was 4 days, 23 hours, 41 minutes.

<text>James Alton McDivitt Jr. (June 10, 1929 – October 13, 2022) was an American test pilot, United States Air Force (USAF) pilot, aeronautical engineer, and NASA astronaut in the Gemini and Apollo programs. He joined the USAF in 1951 and flew 145 combat missions in the Korean War. In 1959, after graduating first in his class with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Michigan through the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) program, he qualified as a test pilot at the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School (Class 59C) and Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class I), and joined the Manned Spacecraft Operations Branch. By September 1962, McDivitt had logged over 2,500 flight hours, of which more than 2,000 hours were in jet aircraft. This included flying as a chase pilot for Robert M. White&#x27;s North American X-15 flight on July 17, 1962, in which White reached an altitude of and became the first X-15 pilot to be awarded Astronaut Wings.

In 1962, McDivitt was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 2. He commanded the Gemini 4 mission, during which Ed White performed the first U.S. spacewalk, and later the Apollo 9 flight, which was the first crewed flight test of the Apollo Lunar Module and the complete set of Apollo flight hardware. He later became the manager of lunar landing operations and was the Apollo spacecraft program manager from 1969 to 1972. In June 1972 he left NASA and retired from the USAF with the rank of brigadier general.

==Early life==
James Alton McDivitt Jr. was born on June 10, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Margaret Mary (née Maxwell; 1903–1994) and James Alton McDivitt Sr. (1901–1982). He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Tenderfoot Scout, now the second rank in Scouting (although the first rank at the time). He grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan and graduated from Kalamazoo Central High School in 1947. He then worked for a year to earn enough money to attend junior college. He completed two years at Jackson Junior College (now known as Jackson College) in Jackson, Michigan, from 1948 to 1950.

==Military service==

In January 1951, McDivitt joined the United States Air Force (USAF). The Korean War had commenced, and his deferment from the draft expired when he graduated from Jackson Junior College. Rather than wait and be drafted by the Army, he elected to enlist in the USAF as a private, and applied for pilot training under the aviation cadet training program. He performed well in training, and was the first in his class to make a solo flight. He received his pilot wings and regular commission as a second lieutenant in the USAF in May 1952 at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and completed combat crew training in November 1952. He flew 145 combat missions in Korea in F-80 Shooting Stars and F-86 Sabres with the 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, and earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses. His last mission was flown two hours after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed.

McDivitt returned to the United States in September 1953 and served as pilot and assistant operations officer with the 19th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Dow Air Force Base, Maine. In November 1954, he entered advanced flying school at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and in July 1955 went to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, where he served as pilot, operations officer, and later as flight commander with the 332d Fighter Interceptor Squadron. In June 1957, he entered the University of Michigan under the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) program, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan, where he graduated first in his class in 1959.

After graduation, he went to Edwards Air Force Base, California, as a student test pilot in June 1959. He remained there with the Air Force Flight Test Center as an experimental flight test pilot, completed the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School (Class 59C) and Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class I), and joined the Manned Spacecraft Operations Branch in July 1962.
By September, McDivitt had logged over 2,500 flight hours, of which more than 2,000 hours was in jet aircraft. This included flying as a chase pilot for Robert M. White&#x27;s North American X-15 flight on July 17, 1962, in which White reached an altitude of and became the first X-15 pilot to be awarded Astronaut Wings based on the USAF definition of space as starting at . McDivitt was in line to fly the X-15 when White left, and to head the project office for testing the McDonnell F-4 Phantom II, but he heard that NASA was looking to select a second group of astronauts to augment the Mercury Seven, and, after some thought, he decided to apply.

==NASA career==
===Project Gemini===

McDivitt was selected as an astronaut by NASA in September 1962 as part of Astronaut Group 2. On July 29, 1964, it was announced that he had been chosen as command pilot of Gemini 4, becoming the first U.S. astronaut to command a crew on his first spaceflight. Only two other Gemini astronauts from this group commanded their first flights: Frank Borman (Gemini 7) and Neil Armstrong (Gemini 8). The Chief of the Astronaut Office, Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, selected Ed White as his pilot because the two men knew each other well, having attended the University of Michigan and test pilot school together.

The mission objectives were ill-defined at first, but consideration was given to performing extravehicular activity (EVA), space rendezvous and orbital station-keeping. Knowing that EVA (sometimes called a &quot;spacewalk&quot;) was a possibility, McDivitt pressed for it to be included in the mission. As a result, NASA management agreed to ensure that the Gemini space suit for the mission was capable of being used for EVA. Kenneth S. Kleinknecht told the July 1964 press conference that announced the mission that one of the crew might open the hatch and stick his head outside, but this attracted little attention. On March 18, 1965, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first man to perform an EVA, on the Voskhod 2 mission, but not until May 25 was EVA approved for Gemini 4 by NASA administrator James E. Webb.
Gemini 4 was launched on June 3, 1965. The mission lasted 97 hours and 56 minutes, and made 62 orbits, The first objective was to attempt the first space rendezvous with the spacecraft&#x27;s spent Titan II launch vehicle&#x27;s upper stage. This was not successful; McDivitt was unable to get closer than what he estimated to be . Several factors worked against him. There were depth-perception problems (his and White&#x27;s visual estimates of the distance differed, variously longer or shorter than each other at different times). The orbital mechanics of rendezvous were not yet well understood by NASA engineers or astronauts; catching up to something requires slowing down. Also, the stage was venting its remaining propellant, which kept pushing it around in different directions relative to the spacecraft.

McDivitt finally broke off the rendezvous attempt in order to save propellant and preserve the second objective, which was for White to perform the first United States EVA. McDivitt controlled the capsule&#x27;s attitude and photographed White during the &quot;walk&quot;. The hatch on Gemini 4, through which White exited to make his walk, was prone to problems with the latch mechanism gears coming unmeshed, making it difficult to open and re-latch the hatch. McDivitt had spent some time before the flight with a McDonnell engineer, improvising a technique of forcing the gears to mesh by inserting the fingers inside the mechanism. The hatch was difficult to open and also to relatch during the flight, but McDivitt was able to get it working both times, with his hands in his pressurized space suit gloves. If he had not been able to get the hatch latched after the spacewalk, both men would have most likely not survived re-entry.
On the second day, over Hawaii, while White was asleep, McDivitt happened to see an unidentified flying object (UFO), which he described as looking &quot;like a beer can or a pop can, and with a little thing like maybe like a pencil or something sticking out of it&quot;. He took a few photographs of it, but did not have time to properly set exposure or focus properly. He believes that since it was visible to him, it must have been in an orbit close to that of his spacecraft, probably a piece of ice or multi-layer insulation that had broken off. Word of the &quot;UFO photos&quot; reached the press by the time the flight splashed down, and one eager reporter waited for the Gemini 4 photos to be processed. He found one with a cluster of three or four images that looked like disc-shaped objects with tails, which became known as the &quot;tadpole&quot; photo. McDivitt has identified these as reflections of bolts in the multipaned windows. Mercury Seven astronaut Gordon Cooper wrote in his memoirs that it is the only officially reported account of a UFO in any of the Mercury, Gemini or Apollo missions.

The mission ran into trouble in its final stages when there was a computer failure. Deviating from the flight plan, flight controller Chris Kraft ordered McDivitt to perform a rolling atmospheric entry like the Mercury astronauts had used rather than the lifting bank angle entry that the computer had been intended to help them achieve. On the way down, McDivitt struggled with a stuck thruster, but eventually slowed and ultimately halted the roll rate. The spacecraft overshot its landing point by , but the astronauts were soon reached by the recovery ship, the . The astronauts found that they were now celebrities. President Lyndon B. Johnson came to Houston to congratulate them, and he promoted them to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
 Later that week they traveled to the White House where Johnson presented them with the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. They were given a ticker tape parade in Chicago, and went to the 1965 Paris Air Show, where they met cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

===Project Apollo===

On March 21, 1966, NASA announced that McDivitt would be the commander (CDR) of the backup crew of the first crewed Project Apollo mission, known as AS-204. The other members of his crew were Astronaut Group 3 astronauts David Scott and Rusty Schweickart. The prime crew was commanded by Mercury Seven astronaut Gus Grissom, with Ed White and rookie Group 3 astronaut Roger Chaffee. Their mission was to test the Apollo command and service module (CSM) in Earth orbit. By December 1966, hopes that the Apollo spacecraft would be ready to fly in 1966 were fading fast, and NASA announced on December 22 that they were replaced as backups for AS-204 by Wally Schirra, Donn Eisele, and Walt Cunningham, the crew of the original second mission, which was canceled. McDivitt&#x27;s crew became the prime crew of a new second mission flying both the CSM and the Lunar Module (LM). The Saturn V rocket was not expected to be available, so the mission would be flown with two Saturn IB rockets, one for the CSM and one for the LM. This mission was called AS-205/208. Under the revised schedule, AS-204 would be flown in February 1967, followed by AS-205/208 in August. It was hoped that the Saturn V would be available by the end of the year, and it would be flown as a third mission with Borman as CDR and Group 3 astronauts Michael Collins and Bill Anders.

McDivitt and his crew were training for this mission when disaster struck on January 27, 1967: a cabin fire killed Grissom&#x27;s crew. All crew assignments were canceled. During the Congressional hearings that followed, McDivitt expressed confidence in NASA&#x27;s management and safety measures. After the Apollo 1 fire, plans resumed for McDivitt&#x27;s crew to fly the Lunar Module mission as the second crewed flight. This was officially announced on November 20, 1967. By the summer of 1968, it was expected that the mission would now be flown as Apollo 8 in December with the Saturn V, which was now expected to be available, but it was increasingly clear that the lunar module would not be ready by that time. McDivitt was summoned to Slayton&#x27;s office. According to McDivitt:

Apollo 9, McDivitt&#x27;s ten-day Earth orbital Lunar Module test mission, lifted off on March 3, 1969. Because there were two spacecraft, two names were required. McDivitt&#x27;s crew called their Lunar Module &quot;Spider&quot; and the command module &quot;Gumdrop&quot;. The crew&#x27;s first major orbital task was to separate the CSM from the S-IVB upper stage, turn around and then dock with the LM, which was on the end of the S-IVB, after which the combined spacecraft separated from the rocket. Scott docked the CSM with the LM, and the probe-and-drogue docking assembly worked properly. After McDivitt and Schweickart inspected the tunnel connecting the CSM and LM, the assembled spacecraft separated from the S-IVB. The next task was to demonstrate that two docked spacecraft could be maneuvered with the one engine, the Service Propulsion System (SPS). This was also successfully accomplished. The S-IVB was then fired again to send it into solar orbit.

The next day McDivitt and Schweickart donned their space suits and entered the LM. This was the first time that astronauts had transferred from one spacecraft to another. They then tested the LM&#x27;s propulsion systems. On the fourth day, Schweickart donned the Primary Life Support System, the backpack that astronauts would later wear on lunar surface EVAs, and exited the LM. At the same time, Scott opened the door of the CSM, and the two astronauts took pictures of each other. The next day, Scott undocked, and McDivitt flew the LM, putting the spacecraft&#x27;s descent engine through its paces. As with the CSM, the crew quickly gained confidence in the reliability and performance of their spacecraft. Finally, he used the LM&#x27;s ascent engine to dock with the CSM once again. After 10 days during which it had made 151 orbits, Apollo 9 splashed safely down in the Atlantic, where it was retrieved by the .

After Apollo 9, McDivitt became Manager of Lunar Landing Operations in May 1969, and led a team that planned the lunar exploration program and redesigned the spacecraft to accomplish this task. In August 1969, he became Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program. As such, he was the program manager for Apollo 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 missions. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on February 17, 1972. When the selection of Gene Cernan to command the Apollo 17 mission was announced, McDivitt confronted Kraft over not being consulted about it, and threatened to resign unless Cernan was removed. Kraft consulted with Slayton, who gave a less than frank account of a January 1971 helicopter accident that Cernan had been involved in, not revealing that Cernan had confessed to flying the helicopter into the water. Kraft then informed McDivitt that Cernan&#x27;s selection stood, and McDivitt resigned, although he stayed on until the end of the Apollo 16 mission.

==Post-NASA career==
McDivitt retired from the USAF and left NASA in June 1972, to take the position of Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs for Consumers Power Company. In March 1975, he joined Pullman, Inc. as Executive Vice President and a director. In October 1975 he became President of the Pullman Standard Division.

In January 1981 he joined Rockwell International where he was the Senior Vice President, Government Operations and International at the time of his retirement, Washington, D.C. He retired in 1995.

<text>Donald Ray McMonagle (born May 14, 1952) (Col, USAF, Ret.) is a former astronaut and a veteran of three shuttle flights. He became the Manager, Launch Integration, at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 15, 1997. In this capacity he was responsible for final shuttle preparation, launch execution, and return of the orbiter to KSC following landings at any other location. He was chair of the Mission Management Team, and was the final authority for launch decision.

==Early years==
McMonagle was born on May 14, 1952, in Flint, Michigan, and graduated from Hamady High School in 1970. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in astronautical engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974, a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from California State University, Fresno in 1985, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Michigan Ross School of Business in 2003.

==Military career==
McMonagle completed pilot training at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi, in 1975. After F-4 training at Homestead AFB, Florida, he went on a one-year tour of duty as an F-4 pilot at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. He returned from overseas to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, in 1977. In 1979, McMonagle was assigned to Luke AFB, Arizona, as an F-15 instructor pilot. In 1981, he entered the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, and was the outstanding graduate in his class. From 1982 to 1985, McMonagle was the operations officer and a project test pilot for the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration F-16 aircraft. After attending the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, from 1985 to 1986, he was assigned as the operations officer of the 6513th Test Squadron at Edwards AFB.

McMonagle has over 5,000 hours of flying experience in a variety of aircraft, primarily the T-38, F-4, F-15, and F-16.

==Astronaut==
McMonagle was selected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1987. A veteran of three space flights, he has logged over 605 hours in space.

McMonagle flew as a mission specialist aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on Department of Defense mission STS-39 in April 1991. During this highly successful eight-day mission, the seven-man crew deployed, operated, and retrieved a remotely controlled spacecraft and conducted several science experiments to include research of both natural and induced phenomena in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

In January 1993, McMonagle served as pilot on STS-54 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The six-day mission featured the deployment of a tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS), and the collection of information about celestial x-rays using a diffuse X-ray spectrometer.

McMonagle commanded a crew of six aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on the STS-66 Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-3 (ATLAS-3) 11-day mission in November 1994.

In January 1996 McMonagle was assigned the task to establish a new Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) Project Office responsible for managing all NASA resources associated with space suits and tools used to conduct spacewalks in support of space shuttles and the International Space Station. This role included responsibility for developing and implementing a plan for research and development of next-generation space suits to support future human space exploration.

==Organizations==
McMonagle is a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots; Association of Graduates, U.S. Air Force Academy; and Association of Space Explorers.

<doc id="622255" wikidata="Q598257" url="?curid=622255" title="Passenger (Swedish band)">
<text>Passenger was a Swedish alternative metal band active between 1995 and 2004.

== History ==
Passenger was formed in 1995 by Sten and Engelin. Both members wanted to do something that was not thrash metal or melodic death metal unlike the bands they played in. At its early stages the band was originally called Cliff. Under the name Cliff they recorded two demos in Studio Fredman that were never released. After a break in the band and after Engelin was hired as a session guitarist for In Flames&#x27; &quot;Whoracle&quot; tour, Anders Fridén, the vocalist of In Flames showed interest in Passenger and joined the band.

In 2000, the band came back from its break and went on to record a demo. In 2001, the band recorded another demo in which early versions of the songs &quot;Used&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot;, &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Drowning City&quot; were recorded. After a third demo the band finally recorded and released their debut album entitled &quot;Passenger&quot;. A video for &quot;In Reverse&quot; was also released. They did their only tour during New Year&#x27;s period of 2003/2004, opening for Lacuna Coil, with Moonspell and Poisonblack.

Sten noted in February 2004 on their official website that they were in the process of recording their second album. However, since then, Fridén, lead vocalist of both Passenger and In Flames has been noted saying that he has little time for the project, due to other commitments, and the group has split up as a result. In an interview with Fridén he stated that as soon as he gets a break from In Flames, he wants to get all the group together to record a second album for early 2010. This however, did not happen as Anders continued touring with In Flames until October 2010 when they entered their studio to record their next album.

As of 2013, a decade after the band released their self-titled debut album, there has not been any activity in regards to regrouping. However, an interview with Unsung Melody, Fridén has acknowledged that there has been some minor activity, but nothing solid.

<doc id="622257" wikidata="Q1629309" url="?curid=622257" title="Quad Cities International Airport">
<text>Quad Cities International Airport is a public airport in Rock Island County, Illinois, three miles (5 km) south of Moline, partly in Blackhawk Township and partly in Coal Valley Township. In 2012 it was named &quot;Illinois Primary Airport of the Year&quot;. It serves the Quad Cities Metropolitan area, including Davenport and Bettendorf in Scott County, Iowa as well as Moline in Rock Island County, Illinois.

The airport does not have any international commercial passenger flights; its international designation is due to being an official port of entry and having a Foreign Trade Zone and U.S. Customs Office, enabling international cargo shipments and international general aviation passenger flights.

The airport is directly south of the Quad-City Seaplane Base, which is located on the Rock River, Quad Cities International&#x27;s northern boundary.

==History==

Franing Field, the site of the present Quad Cities International Airport, was picked as an ideal flying field, with of level, grassy land free of obstacles. The airport made headlines right at the start, chosen as a control point for the first coast-to-coast flight in the fall of 1919. On August 18, 1927 an estimated 10,000 people came to welcome Charles Lindbergh in Moline and his famous plane, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, on the Gugenheim tour, a cross-country commercial aviation promotion tour. In 1929, Phoebe Omlie set an altitude record above the airport in a Velie Monocoupe, the only plane ever manufactured in Moline, which still hangs in the passenger terminal.

In 1947, the Metropolitan Airport Authority of Rock Island County was formed after seven townships voted to establish it.

In 1957, the first count of enplaning and deplaning passengers was made, with a total of 59,701 recorded.

The airport underwent major remodeling in 1961 and 1968, adding everything from baggage claim to a restaurant and boarding areas.

The present airport terminal was completed in 1985 after studies showed that an addition to the 1954 structure would be more costly than an entirely new terminal. The shift to the new $11 million terminal allowed expansion of airline facilities; between 1979 and 1986, the number of airlines increased from two to seven.
AccessAir, Air Midwest, AirTran Airways, America West Airlines, American Airlines, Allegiant Air, Chicago Air, Midway Connection, Northwest Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Pan American World Airways, Skyway Airlines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines, SkyWest Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines have flown to Quad Cities. At one time Mississippi Valley Airlines had its headquarters at the airport. In the early and mid-1990s turboprop equipment was common; Northwest Airlink and other airlines had Saab 340Bs. Carriers have replaced their turboprops with newer regional jets. Allegiant Air Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s fly to Orlando, Las Vegas, Clearwater, and Phoenix/Mesa.

None of the current legacy carriers fly mainline jets from Moline; the most recent mainline service was Delta Air Lines A319s and A320s to Atlanta in 2013. Until 2002-03, American Airlines MD-80s flew to Saint Louis after its acquisition of TWA in the early 2000s; TWA succeeded Ozark, which started flying to Moline in 1950. (Moline&#x27;s first jets were Ozark DC-9s in 1966.)

United Boeing 727s and 737s flew non-stop to Denver until 1995; United flights to Moline began in the 1930s. Republic DC-9s flew to both Detroit and Minneapolis starting in 1986; successor Northwest pulled out in 1989. America West 737s flew to Phoenix in 1987–92, and Braniff served Moline from the 1940s until 1959.

In 2001, the terminal underwent a major renovation and expansion: two new concourses, a larger baggage claim area, new restaurants, and gift shops. The project doubled the size of the terminal. The Philadelphia architectural firm DPK&amp;A designed the new concourses.

A larger U.S. Customs and Border Protection Facility was opened in 2014 in a former air cargo building. The facility processes international passengers arriving on general aviation flights. No airlines use this facility. It has a processing room, an interview room, space for agricultural inspections, office space, and holding cells for passengers who are prohibited from entering the U.S. or who are being detained and transported by law enforcement. Phase two of the project will renovate the remainder of the building to create an international terminal or Federal Inspection Service should the airport establish nonstop international charter flights. Gere-Dismer Architects of Rock Island designed the facility.

On March 30, 2021, the airport announced another major renovation at a cost of $20-$40 million. This renovation will update and expand the ticketing area, which was last updated in 1985. Other changes include a wider TSA screening area, an indoor/outdoor garden and observation deck with water feature, modern seating and power sources throughout the airport, and exterior solar panels above covered parking. The announcement coincided with a renaming of the airport from Quad City International Airport to Quad Cities International Airport along with a new logo. The architectural firm Alliiance, of Minneapolis, designed the renovations.

The airport received funding for this renovation in part from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Upgrades are set to begin in 2023.

The airport set its passenger record in 2007 when 484,212 passengers boarded flights while 481,930 deplaned, for a total of 966,142. The total beat the record of 911,522 set the previous year. In 2008 passenger numbers declined: 957,087 passengers enplaned or deplaned. Passenger count dropped to 763,416 in 2013.

==Facilities==
Quad Cities International Airport covers and has three runways:
* 9/27: , concrete, ILS
* 13/31: , asphalt/concrete
* 5/23: , concrete

Quad Cities International Airport can accommodate any aircraft in almost any weather with the long runways, ILS, and high-intensity lighting. Airport officials claim that the airport is possibly capable of handling the Airbus A380. The airfield has had many changes over the past few years, including extending taxiway H. Runway 5/23 has been expanded to a usable .

Runway 9/27, the longest runway, was rebuilt in 2011. The program included a temporary parallel runway (10/28), now taxiway P. The new runway 9/27 has new pavement, new shoulder construction, taxiway additions, and a new glide-slope capture effect kit for runway 9. It cost $34 million and was completed in late 2012 when the temporary runway became a taxiway.

In 2022, the airport began a reconstruction process to alter the layout of its airport. The plan would shorten runway 5/23 by 1500 feet and add a new taxiway parallel to runway 9/27, the airport&#x27;s main commercial runway. The $10 million project is funded entirely by the FAA.

The airport&#x27;s first air traffic control Tower was on top of the old (1954-era) passenger terminal. The present tower, on the south side of the airport near fixed-base operator Elliot Aviation, is staffed seven days a week from 5:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. At other times control of airspace is by the Chicago Air Traffic Center remoted from Aurora.

The airport is designated international for having a port of entry customs service. A Foreign Trade Zone and U.S. Customs Office are located at the airport, enabling international inbound and outbound shipments. The Customs &amp; Border Protection offices recently opened in the easternmost former cargo building. There are three cargo facilities for every available ramp and the airport has expansion capabilities. A number of air freight companies are located at the airport including BAX Global, DHL, and UPS Supply Chain Solutions.

Fixed-base operators (FBOs) on the airport include Elliott Aviation and QCIA Airport Services.

In 2021 the airport had 28,181 aircraft operations, average 77 per day: 61% general aviation, 21% air taxi, 14% airline and 3% military. In December 2021, 85 aircraft were based at the airport: 55 single-engine, 18 multi-engine, 11 jet and 1 helicopter.

==Services==
The terminal features the full-service Air Host Restaurant. There are also a full-service bar, Paradies Gift Shop, shoe shine service, post office boxes, and a mail drop. An art gallery, featuring local and regional modern and contemporary art, is located near the security check point. There is a visitor information center near baggage claim to provide passengers local tourism information and directions. Free wireless internet (Wi-Fi) is available throughout the airport.

Beyond the security checkpoint in between Concourses A &amp; B, there is a snack bar, lounge, bar, and a Gevalia Kaffe Coffee Shop. Located on Concourse B is a CNBC News and Gift Shop. Destination Points, a frequent flyer lounge, is available for local and regional travelers who fly approximately eight or more times, annually. There are also several work stations that passengers may utilize to set out their computers or work, and recharge their electronics.

There are two hotels on the airport property across the parking lot from the terminal. A three-story Hampton Inn &amp; Suites opened in 2006 and a four-story Holiday Inn Express in 2014. In an effort to decrease the number of people circling the airport proper waiting to pick up arriving passengers a cell phone waiting area was created in 2008 adjacent to the airport&#x27;s entrance road. A consolidated rental car facility opened in October, 2014. 
The airport has a TSA office, serving administrative functions for Downstate IL airports, on the second floor of the terminal.

<text>Carl Joseph Meade (born November 16, 1950) is a former NASA astronaut.

==Personal life==
Meade was born on November 16, 1950, at Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois. He is currently married with two sons. he resides in Canyon Country, California. Meade enjoys woodworking, home-built aircraft construction, racquetball, jogging, and snow skiing. His parents were John Migliorini (later changed to Meade), and Esther Josephine Compitiello.

He graduated in 1968 from Randolph High School, on Randolph Air Force Base, in Texas. In 1973 he received a Bachelor of Science degree (with honors) in electronics engineering from the University of Texas, and in 1975 completed a Master of Science degree in Electronics Engineering from California Institute of Technology. He currently works for Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems as an engineering manager on the Crew Exploration Vehicle project.

==Experience==
Prior to entering active duty in the United States Air Force, Meade was a Hughes Fellow at the California Institute of Technology and an electronics design engineer at Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California. He entered the U.S. Air Force at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, where he was a distinguished graduate of Undergraduate Pilot Training. In 1977, Meade was assigned to the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, where he flew the RF-4C. He was then selected as a member of the USAF Test Pilot School Class 80B.

Upon graduation he received the Liethen-Tittle Award as the Outstanding Test Pilot and was assigned to the 6510th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In 1985, he was reassigned to the USAF Test Pilot School as a test pilot instructor in the F-4, A-7 Corsair II, A-37, and various gliders, teaching performance, stability/control, departure/spins, and radar flight test techniques. He was also the departure/spin lead instructor and avionics systems test training aircraft program manager.

He has logged over 4,800 hours of jet time in 27 different aircraft.

==NASA experience==
Selected by NASA in June 1985, Meade became an astronaut in July 1986. He has held a variety of technical assignments including verification testing of flight software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), crew escape flight tests, Orbiter ground egress tests and launch support duties, both at the Kennedy Space Center and at the Vandenberg Launch Site. Prior to STS-38 and after STS-50, Meade was the Astronaut Office representative to the Solid Rocket Booster Program and the Space Shuttle Main Engine Program at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He also served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control and the lead astronaut for Rendezvous and Docking Operations during the two years following STS-50.

A veteran of three space flights, Meade has logged over 712 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-38 in 1990, STS-50 in 1992, and STS-64 in 1994.

STS-38 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. Meade conducted Department of Defense operations during this five-day flight which concluded after 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, 54 minutes, 28 seconds. In the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985, Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; and her five-man crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990.

STS-50, carrying the first United States Microgravity Laboratory (USML), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 25, 1992. USML is a series of Spacelab flights dedicated to basic scientific research in the fields of fluid physics, combustion science, solid state physics, and biotechnology. This flight was also the first to utilize the Extended Duration Orbiter capabilities of the newly modified Orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot;. Mission duration was 331 hours, 30 minutes, 4 seconds. After 221 orbits of the Earth, the crew of &quot;Columbia&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 9, 1992, thus ending the longest flight in the history of the Space Shuttle Program.

Most recently, Meade flew on STS-64 (September 9–20, 1994) aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The mission highlight occurred when Meade performed the first untethered spacewalk in 10 years. The objective was to flight test a self-rescue jetpack. Meade logged 6.9 hours outside &quot;Discovery&quot; and 3.6 hours piloting the jetpack. Other activities included the first use of lasers for environmental research, deployment and retrieval of a solar science satellite, and the performance of plume characterization studies of the reaction control thruster exhaust. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.

Meade has served as the Deputy Division Chief of the Crew and Thermal Systems Division and as the Chief of the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office. In March 1996, Meade left NASA and the military to join the Lockheed Skunk Works as the Deputy Project Manager for the X-33 vehicle.

<doc id="622260" wikidata="Q4838469" url="?curid=622260" title="Babycham">
<text>Babycham () is a light (6% ABV), sparkling perry invented by Francis Showering, a brewer in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England. The name was owned by Accolade Wines until 2021, when it was bought back into the Showering family business Brothers Drinks Limited. The brand was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s. The new owners are planning a major rebrand and relaunch of the drink.

== History ==
Francis Showering first submitted his new drink to the Three Counties Agricultural Show and other agricultural shows in the late 1940s and early 1950s where it was found to be popular. Initially called &quot;baby champ&quot;, it later became Babycham.

Launched in the United Kingdom in 1953, Babycham was the first alcoholic product to be advertised on British commercial television, the campaign being launched in 1957, with the drink originally marketed as a &quot;genuine champagne perry&quot;. It was the first alcoholic drink aimed specifically at women and used the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;d Love a Babycham&quot;.

In 1965, the Babycham Company sued the food writer Raymond Postgate, founder of the &quot;Good Food Guide&quot;, for an article in &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine in which he warned readers against Babycham, which &quot;looks like champagne and is served in champagne glasses [but] is made of pears&quot;. The company sued for libel, claiming the article implied it was dishonestly passing off Babycham as champagne. The judge in his summation stated that the article was defamatory, but that the jury could consider it as &quot;fair comment&quot; rather than a factual statement. The jury found for Postgate, and he was awarded costs.

During the 1960s, Showerings stopped brewing beer to concentrate on cider and perry. Production of Babycham went from 300 dozen bottles an hour to 2,800 dozen. At the peak in June 1973 144,000 bottles were being produced each hour. To supply the production line, perry pears were planted in Somerset, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Hereford. Until suitable trees could be grown locally, pear juice was imported from Switzerland. The profits helped to pay for the landscaping of the gardens at the company&#x27;s headquarters at Kilver Court.

In 1978, the Babycham company was sued by French Champagne producers for abuse of their trade name. The case (&quot;H P Bulmer Ltd and Showerings Ltd v J Bollinger SA&quot; [1978] RPC 79) hinged on the fact that Babycham had been described in advertising as &#x27;champagne perry&#x27; or &#x27;champagne cider&#x27;. Champagne producers were litigating to protect their goodwill but because there would not actually be confusion, they were unsuccessful.

Sales were boosted in the 1980s by advertising using the slogans &quot;Nothing sparkles like a Babycham&quot; and the more contemporary &quot;Hey, Babycham&quot;.
The brand&#x27;s appeal waned with the rise of cheaply available alternatives and a tightening up of the regulations governing alcohol advertising on television. 1993 saw a major relaunch of the brand and the reintroduction of the chamois mascot, a giant model of which can be seen outside the Shepton Mallet factory where the drink is produced. 1997 saw the reintroduction of Babycham Babe beauty contests that had been popular in the 1960s. The iconic &#x27;Babycham&#x27; logo was designed and created by John Emperor of Collett Dickenson Pearce.

The Showerings&#x27; company was bought by Allied Breweries in 1968 and with it the Babycham brand. The sons of the original Showerings founders went on to produce Brothers Cider, and in 2021 bought the Babycham brand back from its then owner Accolade Wines for an undisclosed sum.

== In the 2010s ==
During 2011 sales were reported to be increasing, with approximately 15 million bottles sold each year.

In 2013 a trademark dispute between Accolade Wines and the Cath Kidston home furnishings company was taken to the High Court.

<text>Bruce Edward Melnick (born December 5, 1949) is a retired American astronaut and United States Coast Guard officer. Following retirement from NASA and the Coast Guard, he entered the aerospace industry. He served as a vice president with the Boeing Co.&#x27;s Integrated Defense Systems group, in charge of Boeing&#x27;s Florida operations at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Melnick retired in 2008 and currently resides on Merritt Island, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Melnick was born December 5, 1949, in New York City, New York, but considers Clearwater, Florida, to be his hometown. He graduated from Clearwater High School, Clearwater, Florida, in 1967. He attended Georgia Institute of Technology for a year, and then went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in Engineering from the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1972, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Systems from the University of West Florida in 1975. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science degree from the University of West Florida on 28 April 2001.

==Coast Guard career==
Melnick spent 20 years in the United States Coast Guard, rising to the rank of commander. His assignments included serving as operations officer and chief test pilot at the Coast Guard Aircraft Program Office in Grand Prairie, Texas. In that capacity, he conducted most of the developmental and all of the acceptance test flights for the HH-65 Dolphin helicopter, including sea trials, and wrote the HH-65 flight manual.

During his Coast Guard service, Melnick received numerous awards, including two Defense Distinguished Service Medals, two Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Secretary of Transportation Heroism Award.

In 1992, he received the U.S. Coast Guard Academy Distinguished Alumni Award. He logged over 5,000 hours flying time, predominantly in the HH-3F Pelican, HH-52 Sea Guard, HH-65 Dolphin, and T-38 Talon aircraft. Melnick retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and left NASA in July 1992.

==NASA career==
Melnick was selected by NASA in 1987. He was the first Coast Guard aviator to participate in the space program and was the first Coast Guard aviator into space. Commander Melnick retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and left NASA in July 1992.

===STS-41===

Melnick served as a mission specialist during STS-41. &quot;Discovery&quot; launched from LC-39B, on October 6, 1990, at 11:47:15 UTC. The primary goal of the mission was to deploy the Ulysses spacecraft in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), which observed the Sun&#x27;s activity across different latitudes.

The Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), combined with the Payload Assist Module (PAM-S), propelled Ulysses towards Jupiter for a gravity assist, slingshotting the spacecraft to its out-of-ecliptic orbit for solar observations. Additionally, STS-41 conducted experiments like the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV), which studied Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, investigations into polymer membrane production (IPMP), Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space (CHROMEX), and more.

The STS-41 mission concluded with the successful landing of &quot;Discovery&quot; at Edwards Air Force Base, Runway 22, on October 10, 1990, at 13:57:19 UTC.

===STS-49===

Melnick once again served as a mission specialist during STS-49. On May 7, 1992, 23:40:00 UTC, &quot;Endeavour&quot; launched from LC-39B on its maiden flight.

The primary mission objective involved a series of spacewalks aimed at capturing and repairing the stranded Intelsat VI satellite. Multiple spacewalks were conducted to retrieve, repair, and redeploy the satellite. The mission featured the first three-person spacewalk, which was an unplanned solution to challenges encountered during the satellite capture. These spacewalks showcased technical proficiency in orbital servicing and repair and set a record for the longest-duration spacewalks at the time. 

STS-49 concluded with the safe landing of &quot;Endeavour&quot; at the Edwards Air Force Base, Runway 22 on May 16, 1992, at 20:57:38 UTC.

==Aerospace-industry career==
Melnick was the vice president for Boeing Florida operations at the John F. Kennedy Space Center. Melnick&#x27;s organization, a part of the Boeing Integrated Defense Systems group, provides a variety of support services to Boeing programs in the state. Headquartered in Titusville, Florida, the organization has approximately 2,400 employees. Services provided by Boeing in Florida include engineering, facilities and maintenance support to NASA and the Department of Defense for the Space Shuttle, International Space Station and Delta rocket programs. Melnick was also responsible for the pursuit of new business for the company in Florida.

Melnick was formerly the Boeing Company vice president, also at the space center, for the payload ground operations contract with NASA, with 1,600 employees. The contract included all the engineering and facilities support and maintenance activities related to preparing spacecraft and/or payloads for the space shuttle missions prior to launch and after landing. The division also provided support to NASA and its contractors for the International Space Station hardware.

Prior to joining Boeing (McDonnell Douglas at the time), Melnick was vice president/director for shuttle engineering at United Space Alliance, formerly Lockheed Martin Space Operations, from 1994 to 1996. From 1992 to 1994, he was director of process improvement technology at Lockheed Space Operations Company.

<doc id="622271" wikidata="Q14863671" url="?curid=622271" title="Choline acetyltransferase">
<text>Choline acetyltransferase (commonly abbreviated as ChAT, but sometimes CAT) is a transferase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme acetyl-CoA to choline, yielding acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is found in high concentration in cholinergic neurons, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). As with most nerve terminal proteins, ChAT is produced in the body of the neuron and is transported to the nerve terminal, where its concentration is highest. Presence of ChAT in a nerve cell classifies this cell as a &quot;cholinergic&quot; neuron. In humans, the choline acetyltransferase enzyme is encoded by the &quot;CHAT&quot; gene.

== History ==
Choline acetyltransferase was first described by David Nachmansohn and A. L. Machado in 1943. A German biochemist, Nachmansohn had been studying the process of nerve impulse conduction and utilization of energy-yielding chemical reactions in cells, expanding upon the works of Nobel laureates Otto Warburg and Otto Meyerhof on fermentation, glycolysis, and muscle contraction. Based on prior research showing that &quot;acetylcholine&#x27;s actions on structural proteins&quot; were responsible for nerve impulses, Nachmansohn and Machado investigated the origin of acetylcholine.

The acetyl transferase mode of action was unknown at the time of this discovery, however Nachmansohn hypothesized the possibility of acetylphosphate or phosphorylcholine exchanging the phosphate (from ATP) for choline or acetate ion. It was not until 1945 that Coenzyme A (CoA) was discovered simultaneously and independently by three laboratories, Nachmansohn&#x27;s being one of these. Subsequently, acetyl-CoA, at the time called “active acetate,” was discovered in 1951. The 3D structure of rat-derived ChAT was not solved until nearly 60 years later, in 2004.

== Structure ==
The 3D structure of ChAT has been solved by X-ray crystallography . Choline is bound in the active site of ChAT by non-covalent interactions between the positively charged amine of choline and the hydroxyl group of Tyr552, in addition to a hydrogen bond between choline&#x27;s hydroxyl group and a histidine residue, His324.

The choline substrate fits into a pocket in the interior of ChAT, while acetyl-CoA fits into a pocket on the surface of the protein. The 3D crystal structure shows the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA abuts the choline binding pocket – minimizing the distance between acetyl-group donor and receiver.

=== Homology ===
ChAT is very conserved across the animal genome. Among mammals, in particular, there is very high sequence similarity. Human and cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) ChAT, for example, have 89% sequence identity.
Sequence identity with &quot;Drosophila&quot; is about 30%.

== Forms of ChAT ==
There are two forms of ChAT: Soluble form and membrane-bound form. The soluble form accounts for 80-90% of the total enzyme activity while the membrane-bound form is responsible for the rest of 10-20% activity. However, there has long been a debate on how the latter form of ChAT is bound to the membrane. The membrane-bound form of ChAT is associated with synaptic vesicles.

=== Common and peripheral isoforms of ChAT ===
There exist two isoforms of ChAT, both encoded by the same sequence. The common type ChAT () is present in both the CNS and PNS. Peripheral type ChAT () is preferentially expressed in the PNS in humans, and arises from exon skipping (exons 6–9) during post-transcriptional modification. Therefore, the amino acid sequence is very similar; however, is missing parts of the sequence present in . The isoform was discovered in 2000 based on observations that brain-derived ChAT antibodies failed to stain peripheral cholinergic neurons as they do for those found in the brain. This gene splicing mechanism which leads to and differences has been observed in various species, including both vertebrate mammals and invertebrate mollusks, suggesting this mechanism leads to some yet-unidentified evolutionary advantage.

== Function ==
Cholinergic systems are implicated in numerous neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons may account for the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system – muscarinic and nicotinic – which are each implicated in different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It is likely implicated in the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine in the CNS is implicated in learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons are implicated in the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.

It is often used as an immunohistochemical marker for motor neurons (motoneurons).

== Mutations ==
Mutants of ChAT have been isolated in several species, including &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, and humans. Most non-lethal mutants that have a non-wild type phenotype exhibit some activity, but significantly less than wild type.

In &quot;C. elegans&quot;, several mutations in ChAT have been traced to the cha-1 gene. All mutations result in a significant drop in ChAT activity. Percent activity loss can be greater than 98% in some cases. Phenotypic effects include slowed growth, decreased size, uncoordinated behavior, and lack of sensitivity toward cholinesterase inhibitors. Isolated temperature-sensitive mutants in &quot;Drosophila&quot; have all been lethal. Prior to death, affected flies show a change in behavior, including uncontrolled movements and a change in electroretinogram activity.

The human gene responsible for encoding ChAT is CHAT. Mutations in CHAT have been linked to congenital myasthenic syndrome, a disease which leads to general motor function deficiency and weakness. Further symptoms include fatal apnea. Out of ten isolated mutants, 1 has been shown to lack activity completely, 8 have been shown to have significantly decreased activity, and 1 has an unknown function.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===

The Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) involves difficulty in memory and cognition. The concentrations of acetylcholine and ChAT are remarkably reduced in the cerebral neocortex and hippocampus. Although the cellular loss and dysfunction of the cholinergic neurones is considered a contributor to Alzheimer disease, it is generally not considered as a primary factor in the development of this disease. It is proposed that the aggregation and deposition of the Beta amyloid protein, interferes with the metabolism of neurones and further damages the cholinergic axons in the cortex and cholinergic neurones in the basal forebrain.

=== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ===
The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common motor neuron diseases. A significant loss of ChAT immunoreactivity is found in ALS. It is hypothesized that the cholinergic function is involved in an uncontrolled increase of intracellular calcium concentration whose reason still remains unclear.

=== Drugs ===
Neostigmine methylsulfate, an anticholinesterase agent, has been used to target ChAT. In particular, use of neostigmine methylsulfate has been shown to have positive effects against congenital myasthenic syndrome.

Exposure to estradiol has been shown to increase ChAT in female rats.

<doc id="622273" wikidata="Q3177745" url="?curid=622273" title="Edrophonium">
<text>Edrophonium is a readily reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It prevents breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, mainly at the neuromuscular junction. It is sold under the trade names Tensilon and Enlon (according to FDA Orange Book).

==Clinical uses==
Edrophonium (by the so-called Tensilon test) is used to differentiate myasthenia gravis from cholinergic crisis and Lambert-Eaton. In myasthenia gravis, the body produces autoantibodies which block, inhibit or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. Edrophonium—an effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor—will reduce the muscle weakness by blocking the enzymatic effect of acetylcholinesterase enzymes, prolonging the presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. It binds to a Serine-103 allosteric site, while pyridostigmine and neostigmine bind to the AchE active site for their inhibitory effects. In a cholinergic crisis, where a person has too much neuromuscular stimulation, edrophonium will make the muscle weakness worse by inducing a depolarizing block. However, the edrophonium and ice pack tests are no longer recommended as first-line tests due to false positive results. In practice, the edrophonium test has been replaced by testing for autoantibodies, including acetylcholine receptor (AchR) autoantibodies and muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) autoantibodies.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), is similar to myasthenia gravis in that it is an autoimmune disease. However, in LEMS the neuron is unable to release enough acetylcholine for normal muscle function due to autoantibodies attacking P/Q-type calcium channel that are necessary for acetylcholine release. This means there is insufficient calcium ion influx into presynaptic terminal resulting in reduced exocytosis of acetylcholine containing vesicles. Consequently, there will typically be not as much increase in muscle strength observed after edrophonium injection, if any with LEMS.

The Tensilon test may also be used to predict if neurotoxic paralysis caused by snake envenomation is presynaptic or postsynaptic. If it is a postsynaptic then paralysis will be temporally reversed, indicating that can be reversed by adequate antivenom therapy. If the neurotoxic is presynaptic then the Tensilon test will show no response and antivenom will not reverse such paralysis. In this instance reversal of paralysis will not occur until the damaged terminal axons at the neuromuscular junction have recovered, this may take days or weeks.

The drug may also be used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade at the end of a surgical procedure.

==Chemistry==
Edrophonium, ethyl-(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylammonium chloride, is made by reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with ethyl bromide, which forms ethyl(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylammonium bromide, the bromine atom of which is replaced with a chlorine atom by reacting it with silver chloride, giving edrophonium.

==Pharmacokinetics==
The drug has a brief duration of action, about 10–30 mins.

<doc id="622275" wikidata="Q7662655" url="?curid=622275" title="Syntactic pivot">
<text>The syntactic pivot is the verb argument around which sentences &quot;revolve&quot; in a given language. This usually means the following:

*If the verb has more than zero arguments, then one argument is the syntactic pivot.
*If the verb agrees with at least one of its arguments, then it agrees with the syntactic pivot.
*In coordinated propositions, in languages where an argument can be left out, the omitted argument is the syntactic pivot.

The first two characteristics have to do with simple morphosyntax, and from them, it is quite obvious the syntactic pivot in English (and most other European languages) is called the subject. An English verb cannot lack a subject (even in the imperative mood, the subject is implied to be &quot;you&quot; and is not ambiguous or unspecified) and cannot have just a direct object and no subject; and (at least in the present tense, and for the verb &quot;to be&quot;) it agrees partially with the subject.

The third point deserves an explanation. Consider the following sentence:

:I shot the deer and killed it.

There are two coordinated propositions, and the second proposition lacks an explicit subject, but since the subject is the syntactic pivot, the second proposition is assumed to have the same subject as the first one. One cannot do so with a direct object (in English). The result would be ungrammatical or have a different meaning:

:*I shot the deer and I killed.

The syntactic pivot is a feature of the morphosyntactic alignment of the language. In nominative–accusative languages, the syntactic pivot is the so-called &quot;subject&quot; (the argument marked with the nominative case). In ergative–absolutive languages, the syntactic pivot may be the argument marked with the absolutive case but not always so since ergative languages are often not &quot;pure&quot; and show a mixed behaviour (they can have ergative morphology and accusative syntax).

Languages with a passive voice construction may resort to it to allow the default syntactic pivot to shift its semantic role (from agent to patient) in a coordinated proposition:

:He worked hard and was awarded a prize.

<text>Leo Anton Karl de Ball (November 23, 1853 – December 12, 1916) was a German-Austrian astronomer. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center as &quot;K. de Ball&quot; for his (sole) asteroid discovery, but seems to be best known as Leo de Ball.

He was born at Lobberich in the Rhineland, in the Kingdom of Prussia. He studied in Bonn and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1877. He worked at observatories in Gotha and at Bothkamp, discovering the asteroid 230 Athamantis at the latter in 1882. He then worked at Ougrée Observatory in Ougrée, Belgium, where he analyzed the mass of Saturn and worked on celestial mechanics and measurements of parallax and of double stars.

From 1891 until his death in 1916 he was director of the Kuffner observatory in Vienna. Among other things, he measured the parallax of a number of stars and compiled data for a star catalog.

He continued his education at MIT, earning a Degree of Mechanical Engineer in 1990 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in mechanical engineering in 1992.

==Career==
Upon completing his B.S. degree from Columbia, Massimino worked for IBM as a systems engineer in New York City from 1984 until 1986. In 1986 he entered graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he conducted research on human operator control of space robotics systems in the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department&#x27;s human–machine systems Laboratory. His work resulted in the awarding of two patents. While a student at MIT he worked during the summer of 1987 as a general engineer at NASA Headquarters in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. He received an MS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 1988, and MS in Technology and Policy from MIT in 1988. During the summers of 1988 and 1989 as a research fellow in the Man-Systems Integration Branch at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and during the summer of 1990 as a visiting research engineer at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. He received the Degree of Mechanical Engineer from MIT in 1990, and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1992. Massimino worked at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Houston, Texas as a research engineer where he developed laptop computer displays to assist operators of the Space Shuttle remote manipulator system. These displays included the Manipulator Position Display, which was evaluated on STS-69. From 1992 to 1994 he was also an adjunct assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering &amp; Material Sciences Department at Rice University, where he taught feedback control of mechanical systems. In September 1995, Massimino joined the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. At Georgia Tech he taught human-machine systems engineering classes and conducted research on human-machine interfaces for space and aircraft systems in the Center for Human-Machine Systems Research. He has published papers in technical journals and in the proceedings of technical conferences.

===NASA career===

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1996, Massimino reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of initial training and evaluation and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Prior to his first space flight assignment, Massimino served in the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch, and in the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Branch. He has served as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in Mission Control and performed other technical tasks in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch.

On July 29, 2014, Massimino announced that he would be leaving NASA to pursue a teaching career at Columbia University, in New York City.

====Spaceflight experience====
STS-109 &quot;Columbia&quot; (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope, leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera (the Advanced Camera for Surveys), and new solar arrays. STS-109 set a record for spacewalk time with 35 hours and 55 minutes during 5 spacewalks. Massimino performed two spacewalks totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 4.5 million statute miles in over 262 hours and 10 minutes.

STS-125 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (May 11–24, 2009) was the final Hubble servicing mission by the Space Shuttle. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed in California after stormy weather prevented the shuttle from landing at NASA&#x27;s home base in Florida as previously planned. During the mission Massimino became the first person to use Twitter in space, writing, &quot;From orbit: Launch was awesome!! I am feeling great, working hard, &amp; enjoying the magnificent views, the adventure of a lifetime has begun!&quot;

=== Post-NASA career ===
At Columbia University, Massimino is teaching an undergraduate engineering course, &quot;Introduction to Human Space Flight&quot;, which harnesses his years of academic and professional experience. He is also collaborating on &quot;The Art of Engineering&quot;, a course in which all first-year engineers work on engineering projects with socially responsible themes.

Massimino&#x27;s book, &quot;Spaceman: An Astronaut&#x27;s Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe&quot;, is a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

The street that Massimino grew up on in Franklin Square, Long Island has been renamed &quot;Mike Massimino Street&quot;.

September 17, 2022 Massimino was the Grand Marshal for the NYC Feast of San Gennaro

==In media==
Massimino is a frequent guest on television news and talk show programs, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, CNN, and Fox News. He has also appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;.

In the PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot;, Massimino appeared as himself in an episode focused on scientists.

Beginning in 2012, Massimino appeared as himself in a recurring role on the CBS TV sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; launching aboard a Russian Soyuz to the International Space Station. He appeared in another episode advising Howard Wolowitz not to throw out the opening pitch at a baseball game. His screen credit reads &quot;Mike Massimino, NASA Astronaut&quot;.

He is a frequent guest on Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x27;s podcast &quot;StarTalk&quot;, and has also appeared on the TV version.

Massimino performed twice at a storytelling event of The Moth: on November 14, 2012, he talked about the high stakes in the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in &quot;A View of the Earth&quot; and on February 21, 2017, he talked about the swimming test at the beginning of his astronaut training in &quot;Swimming with Astronauts&quot;.

Massimino makes a brief appearance at a Shuttle launch in Chapter XXIX of the 2012 novel &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot;, in which he discusses his experience in space.

Massimino was a guest in episode 414 of &quot;The Nerdist Podcast&quot;.

After the October 4, 2013, release of the film &quot;Gravity&quot; with Sandra Bullock, Massimino commented on the scientific reliability of the movie. It was also suggested that the role played by George Clooney was partially based on Massimino&#x27;s spacewalk performance.

Massimino&#x27;s book &quot;Spaceman: An Astronaut&#x27;s Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe&quot; was published by Crown Archetype on October 4, 2016 The Audible e-book version is narrated by Massimino himself.

In 2017, Massimino hosted Science Channel&#x27;s live coverage of the total solar eclipse of August 21, dubbed the &quot;Great American Eclipse.&quot;

Soon after, he became host of Science&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, an in-depth look at the planets of the Solar System as well as dwarf planets and exoplanets. The series was renewed for a second season, which began airing in 2018 under the new title &quot;The Planets and Beyond&quot;. He also hosted an online companion series, &quot;Ask the Astronaut&quot;, in which he talked about his personal experiences of spaceflight.

In 2019, Massimino hosted a YouTube series for &quot;Wired&quot; where he discusses the differences between life on Earth and in space, discussing topics like Food, Sleep, and Hygiene.

Massimino voiced the NASA launch control official in the 2022 animated comedy &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;.

In 2024, Massimino was a guest speaker on the podcast &quot;Finding Mastery&quot;, called an astronaut&#x27;s guide to achieving the impossible.

<text>Nicotine polacrilex is nicotine bound to an ion-exchange resin (polymethacrylic acid, such as Amberlite IRP64, Purolite C115HMR or Doshion P551). It is added to gum and hard lozenges used for nicotine replacement therapy in smoking cessation, such as in the Nicorette range of products. The use of the polymer as a delivery system maximizes the amount of nicotine released and absorbed by the oral mucosa. 80 to 90 percent of the nicotine released from the gum is absorbed by the mouth. Side effects of the gum include bad taste, nausea, dyspepsia, and stomatitis.

Mastracchio was a flight engineer on Expedition 38/39 aboard the International Space Station and was one of the astronauts repairing the malfunctioning main cooling system during the mission. He returned to Earth on May 13, 2014.

He retired from NASA in June 2017.

===Spaceflight experience===

===STS-106===

Atlantis (September 8–20, 2000). During the 12-day mission, the crew prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, a toilet and a treadmill. Two crewmembers performed a spacewalk to connect power, data and communications cables between the newly arrived Zvezda Service Module and the other station modules. Mastracchio was the ascent/entry flight engineer, the primary robotic arm operator, and responsible for the transfer of items from the Space Shuttle to the Space Station. STS-106 orbited the Earth 185 times, and covered 4.9 million miles in 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes.

===STS-118===

Endeavour (August 8–21, 2007) was the 119th space shuttle flight, the 22nd flight to the station, and the 20th flight for Endeavour. During the mission Endeavour&#x27;s crew successfully added another truss segment, a new gyroscope and external spare parts platform to the International Space Station. Mastracchio was the ascent/entry flight engineer and participated in three of the four spacewalks. Traveling 5.3 million miles in space, the STS-118 mission was completed in 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes and 34 seconds.

===STS-131===
Discovery (April 5–20, 2010), a resupply mission to the International Space Station, was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center. 

On arrival at the station, Discovery&#x27;s crew dropped off more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant, new crew sleeping quarters, and three experiment racks. As the EVA lead, Mastracchio performed three spacewalks during this mission and logged 20 hours and 17 minutes of extravehicular activity. On the return journey, the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module inside Discovery&#x27;s payload bay was packed with over 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results, and trash. The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 02 hours, 47 minutes, 10 seconds, and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 orbits.
Mastracchio launched on Expedition 38/39 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station along with Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Flight Engineer Koichi Wakata. During his stay aboard the space station, Mastracchio conducted three spacewalks, the first two to remove and replace a faulty cooling pump, and the third to remove and replace a failed backup computer relay box. Mastracchio, Tyurin and Wakata returned to Earth after 188 days in space. During the expedition, the crew completed 3,008 orbits of the Earth and traveled more than 79.8 million miles.

===Expedition 38/39===
Mastracchio launched for his fourth space flight onboard Soyuz TMA-11M alongside veteran Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin and JAXA&#x27;s Koichi Wakata, with additional focus on the launch due to a publicity stunt related to the 2014 Winter Olympics, due to be held in Sochi. 
The Soyuz followed the new rendezvous profile, and the crew docked with the ISS approximately 6 hours after launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. 

Mastracchio performed 3 EVAs during the mission, 2 with Michael S. Hopkins, and his final career EVA with Steven Swanson, whereby they replaced a backup multiplexer-demultiplexer (MDM) that failed during routine testing April 11, 2014. They duration of the EVA was 1 hour and 36 minutes.

Mastracchio, Tyurin and Wakata returned to Earth on May 14, 2014, after spending nearly 188 days in space.

==Post-NASA career==
On June 19, 2017, Mastracchio was appointed Senior Director of Operations for Commercial Resupply Services at Orbital ATK.
He is currently Director Of Business Development at Northrop Grumman Space Systems.

<doc id="622283" wikidata="Q3101971" url="?curid=622283" title="George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend">
<text>Field Marshal George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, PC (28 February 172414 September 1807), known as The Viscount Townshend from 1764 to 1787, was a British soldier and politician. After serving at the Battle of Dettingen during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Battle of Culloden during the Jacobite Rising, Townshend took command of the British forces for the closing stages of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He went on to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland or Viceroy where he introduced measures aimed at increasing the size of Irish regiments, reducing corruption in Ireland and improving the Irish economy. In cooperation with Prime Minister North in London, he solidified governmental control over Ireland. He also served as Master-General of the Ordnance, first in the North Ministry and then in the Fox–North Coalition.

==Military career==

===Early years===

Born the son of Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend, and Audrey Etheldreda Townshend (born Harrison), Townshend was educated at Eton College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He joined the army as a volunteer in Summer 1743 and first saw action at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He became a captain in the 7th Regiment of Dragoons in April 1745 and saw action in the Netherlands. He fought at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 during the Jacobite Rising, and having been appointed an aide-de-Camp to the Duke of Cumberland and having transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot in February 1747, he took part in the Battle of Lauffeld in July 1747 during the later stages of the War of the Austrian Succession.

While serving in Belgium, Townshend was elected Member of Parliament for Norfolk unopposed in 1747. He became a captain in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and lieutenant colonel in the Army on 25 February 1748. In 1751 he wrote a pamphlet which was deeply critical of Cumberland&#x27;s military skills. Meanwhile, he argued in parliament that courts martial rather than commanding officers should be responsible for discipline in the Army, pressed for a larger militia and smaller standing army and was personally responsible for ensuring that the Militia Act 1757 reached the statute book. Once the legislation had passed, Townshend and his family assisted the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk, George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford, in putting it into effect in the county. Orford nominated Townshend as Colonel of the West Norfolk Militia. Promoted to the rank of colonel in the army on 6 May 1758, he became colonel of the 64th Regiment of Foot in June 1759.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===
Townshend was given command of a brigade in Quebec under General James Wolfe; when the latter died on 13 September 1759, and his second-in-command (Robert Monckton) was wounded, Townshend took command of the British forces during Battle of the Plains of Abraham. He received Quebec City&#x27;s surrender on 18 September 1759. However, he held General Wolfe in much contempt (drawing Wolfe in caricature he created Canada&#x27;s first cartoon), and was harshly criticized upon his return to Great Britain for that reason (Wolfe was a popular hero throughout the country). Nevertheless, he became colonel of the 28th Regiment of Foot in October 1759, was promoted to major general on 6 March 1761 and fought at the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761. In May 1762 he took command of a division of the Anglo-Portuguese army, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, to protect Portugal during the Spanish invasion of Portugal.

===Post-war===

Townshend became Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance in the Grenville Ministry in March 1763 and succeeded his father as Viscount Townshend in March 1764.

==Viceroy of Ireland==
He went on to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the Chatham Ministry in August 1767 and introduced measures aimed at increasing the size of Irish regiments, reducing corruption in Ireland and improving the Irish economy. After the Parliament of Ireland rejected his money bill, Townshend prorogued parliament in November 1767, making himself very unpopular in Dublin. Most important, he collaborated with Prime Minister Lord North in London in solidified governmental control over Ireland.

==Later life==
Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 30 April 1770, he was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in September 1772.

Townshend returned to office as Master-General of the Ordnance in the North Ministry in October 1772. In the aftermath of his unpopular tour in Ireland, he found himself fighting a duel with Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, an Irish Peer, on 2 February 1773, badly wounding the Earl with a bullet in the groin. Townshend became colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards in July 1773.

In 1779 Richard Edwards, Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, began work on Fort Townshend, a fortification in Newfoundland and Labrador, naming it after Lord Townshend. Townshend stood down as Master-General of the Ordnance in March 1782 when the Marquess of Rockingham came to power but, having been promoted to full general on 26 November 1782, was restored to the post of Master-General of the Ordnance in the Fox–North Coalition in April 1783. He retired from that office when William Pitt the Younger came to power in January 1784.

Created Marquess Townshend on 27 October 1787, Townshend became Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk in February 1792. He also became Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1794 and Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in July 1795. A peculiar tragedy befell Townshend in May 1796: his son, Lord Charles, had just been elected MP for Great Yarmouth, and he took a carriage to London with his brother, the Rev. Lord Frederick, the Rector of Stiffkey. During the journey, Lord Frederick inexplicably killed his brother with a pistol shot to the head and was ultimately adjudged insane. Promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796, Townshend died at his family home, Raynham Hall in Norfolk on 14 September 1807 and was buried in the family vault there.

==Family==
On 19 December 1751, Townshend married Charlotte Compton, 16th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley (d. 1770), daughter of James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton. They had eight children:

* George Townshend, 2nd Marquess Townshend (1755–1811), Earl of Leicester since 1784 (created by George III)

He married Anne Montgomery, the daughter of Sir William Montgomery, 1st Baronet, on 19 May 1773. Anne was Mistress of the Robes to Caroline, Princess of Wales, from 1795 to 1820. They had six children:
* Lord William Townshend (1778–1794)
* Captain Lord James Nugent Boyle Bernardo Townshend (11 September 178528 June 1842)

<doc id="622284" wikidata="Q411461" url="?curid=622284" title="Pilocarpine">
<text>Pilocarpine, sold under the brand name Pilopine HS among others, is a lactone alkaloid originally extracted from plants of the Pilocarpus genus. It is used as a medication to reduce pressure inside the eye and treat dry mouth. As an eye drop it is used to manage angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be performed, ocular hypertension, primary open angle glaucoma, and to constrict the pupil after dilation. However, due to its side effects, it is no longer typically used for long-term management. Onset of effects with the drops is typically within an hour and lasts for up to a day. By mouth it is used for dry mouth as a result of Sjögren syndrome or radiation therapy.
Common side effects of the eye drops include irritation of the eye, increased tearing, headache, and blurry vision. Other side effects include allergic reactions and retinal detachment. Use is generally not recommended during pregnancy. Pilocarpine is in the miotics family of medication. It works by activating cholinergic receptors of the muscarinic type which cause the trabecular meshwork to open and the aqueous humor to drain from the eye.
Pilocarpine was isolated in 1874 by Hardy and Gerrard and has been used to treat glaucoma for more than 100 years. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the South American plant &quot;Pilocarpus&quot;.

== Medical uses ==
Pilocarpine stimulates the secretion of large amounts of saliva and sweat. It is used to prevent or treat dry mouth, particularly in Sjögren syndrome, but also as a side effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

It may be used to help differentiate Adie syndrome from other causes of unequal pupil size.

It may be used to treat a form of dry eye called &quot;aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE)&quot;

===Surgery===
Pilocarpine is sometimes used immediately before certain types of corneal grafts and cataract surgery. It is also used prior to YAG laser iridotomy. In ophthalmology, pilocarpine is also used to reduce symptomatic glare at night from lights when the patient has undergone implantation of phakic intraocular lenses; the use of pilocarpine would reduce the size of the pupils, partially relieving these symptoms. The most common concentration for this use is pilocarpine 1%. Pilocarpine is shown to be just as effective as apraclonidine in preventing intraocular pressure spikes after laser trabeculoplasty.

=== Presbyopia ===
In 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pilocarpine hydrochloride as an eye drop treatment for presbyopia, age-related difficulty with near-in vision. It works by causing the pupils to constrict, increasing depth of field, similar to the effect of pinhole glasses.

===Other===
Pilocarpine is used to stimulate sweat glands in a sweat test to measure the concentration of chloride and sodium that is excreted in sweat. It is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis.

== Adverse effects ==
Use of pilocarpine may result in a range of adverse effects, most of them related to its non-selective action as a muscarinic receptor agonist. Pilocarpine has been known to cause excessive salivation, sweating, bronchial mucus secretion, bronchospasm, bradycardia, vasodilation, and diarrhea. Eye drops can result in brow ache and chronic use in miosis. It can also cause temporary blurred vision or darkness of vision, temporary shortsightedness, hyphema and retinal detachment.

==Pharmacology==
Pilocarpine is a drug that acts as a muscarinic receptor agonist. It acts on a subtype of muscarinic receptor (M3) found on the iris sphincter muscle, causing the muscle to contract - resulting in pupil constriction (miosis). Pilocarpine also acts on the ciliary muscle and causes it to contract. When the ciliary muscle contracts, it opens the trabecular meshwork through increased tension on the scleral spur. This action facilitates the rate that aqueous humor leaves the eye to decrease intraocular pressure. Paradoxically, when pilocarpine induces this ciliary muscle contraction (known as an accommodative spasm) it causes the eye&#x27;s lens to thicken and move forward within the eye. This movement causes the iris (which is located immediately in front of the lens) to also move forward, narrowing the Anterior chamber angle. Narrowing of the anterior chamber angle increases the risk of increased intraocular pressure.

==Society and culture==
=== Preparation ===
Plants in the genus &quot;Pilocarpus&quot; are the only known sources of pilocarpine, and commercial production is derived entirely from the leaves of &quot;Pilocarpus microphyllus&quot; (Maranham Jaborandi). This genus grows only in South America, and &quot;Pilocarpus microphyllus&quot; is native to several states in northern Brazil.

Pilocarpine is extracted from the leaves of Pilocarpus microphyllus in a multi-step process : the sample is moistened with dilute sodium hydroxide to transform the alkaloid into its free-base form then extracted using chloroform or a suitable organic solvant. Pilocarpine can then be further purified by re-extracting the resulting solution with aqueous sulfuric acid then readjusting the pH to basic using ammonia and a final extraction by chloroform.

It can also be synthesized from 2-ethyl-3-carboxy-2-butyrolactone in a 8 steps process from the acyl chloride (by treatment with thionyl chloride) via a Arndt–Eistert reaction with diazomethane then by treatment with potassium phthalimide and potassium thiocyanate.

=== Brand names ===

Pilocarpine is available under several brand names such as: Diocarpine (Dioptic), Isopto Carpine (Alcon), Miocarpine (CIBA Vision), Ocusert Pilo-20 and -40 (Alza), Pilopine HS (Alcon), Salagen (MGI Pharma), Scheinpharm Pilocarpine (Schein Pharmaceutical), Timpilo (Merck Frosst), and Vuity (AbbVie).

== Research ==

Pilocarpine is used to induce chronic epilepsy in rodents, commonly rats, as a means to study the disorder&#x27;s physiology and to examine different treatments. Smaller doses may be used to induce salivation in order to collect samples of saliva, for instance, to obtain information about IgA antibodies.

<doc id="622285" wikidata="Q1196801" url="?curid=622285" title="Pikmin 2">
<text>is a 2004 real-time strategy puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It is the direct sequel to the 2001 game &quot;Pikmin&quot; and the second game in the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series. In the game, Olimar returns to the Pikmin planet to collect valuable treasure after learning that the company he works for—Hocotate Freight—is on the verge of bankruptcy. 

Like its predecessor, &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; focuses on exploring an unknown planet&#x27;s surface from a microscopic perspective, where the player directs the Pikmin to perform various tasks, such as destroying obstacles, defeating enemies, and retrieving objects. It introduces new gameplay mechanics, including the ability to control two different leaders at once and the addition of new Pikmin types.

&quot;Pikmin 2&quot; received critical acclaim, gaining aggregate scores of 89.60% and 90 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Many critics praised the various additions and changes, such as the new Pikmin types, longer length and the removal of the 30-day time limit imposed in the original game. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; was re-released as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series for the Wii in 2009 in Japan, Europe and Australia and it received a North American release three years later in 2012. An HD remaster of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch in June 2023. A sequel to the game, &quot;Pikmin 3&quot;, was released in 2013 for the Wii U.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Pikmin 2&quot; expands on the gameplay introduced in its predecessor, &quot;Pikmin&quot;. The player controls both Captain Olimar and Louie from a third-person microscopic perspective to retrieve treasures (which consist of human waste such as scrap metal and broken toys) from the surface of an unknown planet (called the &quot;distant planet&quot;). The gameplay focuses on leading and directing a horde of plant-like creatures called Pikmin to accomplish this mission. The Pikmin follow behind Olimar and/or Louie as they move around the field. The player can quickly throw individual Pikmin at enemies and obstacles, where they automatically engage in combat, destroying obstacles, or building bridges. The player can also direct the entire mob (or a subdivision) to swarm and attack enemies en masse. Because the player controls two leaders simultaneously, they can have the leaders separate with their own Pikmin hordes to complete multiple tasks at once. While the player can amass a limitless number of Pikmin, only up to 100 Pikmin are allowed on the field at any time.
The player can only explore during the daylight and begins each day at sunrise, and must finish all tasks and collect all stray Pikmin before sunset. Pikmin that are left behind at sunset are lost to ferocious nocturnal predators, a mechanic that was also in &quot;Pikmin&quot;. Unlike &quot;Pikmin&quot;, the game lacks a time limit and gives the player an unlimited number of days.

The Pikmin themselves come in five distinct colors, which indicates their strength or immunity to hazards. Red, Blue, and Yellow Pikmin, which originally appeared in &quot;Pikmin&quot;, are resilient to fire, drowning, and electric hazards, respectively. Two new colors, Purple and White, are unique to &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;. White Pikmin are swifter than the other types, can resist poisonous gases and poison enemies if devoured, and can locate hidden treasures buried in the soil. Purple Pikmin, while not immune to any hazards, are slower but far stronger than the others and can lift as much as 10 ordinary Pikmin. They are also heavy, and can stun enemies when thrown at them. Because of these characteristics, the player must choose the Pikmin that are best-suited to the task at hand. The stalk on a Pikmin&#x27;s head, topped with either a leaf, bud, or flower, indicates their swiftness and strength, growing upon consumption of nectar harvested from various sources. More Pikmin can be born by bringing pellets or enemy carcasses to the &quot;Onion&quot; motherships, where they can be safely stored and extracted. Purple and White Pikmin do not have their own Onions and are stored inside the Hocotate Ship, and are created by throwing existing Pikmin into rare flowers called Candypop Buds. The game also introduces a sixth Pikmin type, Bulbmin, which are resistant to all hazards but are only temporarily usable. Lastly, it introduces sprays that can be collected by harvesting certain plants. The purple spray can be sprayed on enemies, and causes them to temporarily be encased in stone, making them vulnerable to attacks. The red spray gives Pikmin a temporary boost to their speed and attack strength.

The player is able to explore four distinct locales on the distant planet, which vary in theme, enemies, and treasures found. The player is also accompanied by the Hocotate Ship&#x27;s artificial intelligence, which gives them hints and input. When a treasure is found, the Pikmin carry it back to the Hocotate Ship, where it will be placed into the ship&#x27;s cargo hold and its worth calculated. In addition to exploring the surface of each locale, there are caves scattered throughout the landscape, which the player, the Pikmin horde, and the ship&#x27;s AI can enter. Caves contain multiple treasures and enemies spread across multiple sub-levels. Some enemies, such as the Waterwraith, are found only within caves. While inside a cave, time does not pass on the surface due to a time warp caused by a strong geomagnetic field, allowing the player to explore for an indefinite period of time before sunset. However, the Pikmin Onions do not follow the player, meaning that they must bring enough Pikmin beforehand to use within the cave. Caves are also home to larger, stronger enemies that serve as the game&#x27;s bosses, which upon defeat award treasures that bestow new abilities to the player characters. Cave layouts are randomly generated, but certain floors are not, generally boss floors. Caves are also the only place to find the &quot;Violet&quot; or &quot;Ivory&quot; &quot;Candypop Buds&quot; that make Purple or White Pikmin. The player completes the game after collecting all 201 treasures.

=== Additional modes ===
In addition to the main single-player game mode, there is a two-player competitive mode and an unlockable challenge mode. In the competitive game mode, Olimar and Louie are each controlled by a player. In a capture the flag style gameplay, the player&#x27;s objective is to either retrieve four yellow marbles or claim the opponent&#x27;s marble using Pikmin. A player can launch attacks against the other&#x27;s Pikmin to hinder the opponent&#x27;s progress. When a player collects a cherry, an advantage is gained, such as gaining or flowering Pikmin or summoning enemies at the opponent&#x27;s base.

The challenge mode is unlocked during the single-player game. One or two players can play this mode cooperatively. Each selectable level takes place in caves of varying depth, and the objective is to locate a Key treasure, used to open access to the next sub-level, within the specified time limit. The player completes the level upon finding the cave&#x27;s exit, and is scored based on the treasures collected, the number of Pikmin surviving upon exit, and the time taken to complete the level.

== Plot ==
After the events of &quot;Pikmin&quot;, Captain Olimar returns to his home planet Hocotate. He learns from his employer (a space transport company) that his co-worker, Louie, lost a shipment of luxury carrots to a &quot;space rabbit&quot;. The company is forced to take out a large loan to cover the loss, and immediately sells Olimar&#x27;s ship. When Olimar drops a bottle cap he brought home as a souvenir, an intelligent company ship appraises it as considerably valuable. The company president orders Olimar and Louie to take the ship to the planet where the treasure was found, and collect more of it to save the company.

Upon arriving on the Pikmin&#x27;s planet, Olimar and Louie are initially separated, but reunite after working with the local red Pikmin population. In the process of finding treasure, they encounter White and Purple Pikmin, two new species that Olimar had never encountered before. After finding enough treasure, Olimar takes off for Hocotate, only to realize mid-flight that Louie was accidentally left behind. Though the debt is cleared, upon Olimar&#x27;s suggestion the president decides that they must return to find treasures and help strengthen the company&#x27;s finances, and joins Olimar on his return trip to the Pikmin&#x27;s planet to find Louie. Eventually the pair encounters Louie in the Dream Den atop of a giant elemental creature called the Titan Dweevil that can harness the ability to switch between using fire, water, poison and electricity through treasures. After defeating the creature, Olimar and the president retrieve Louie and the final treasures, and depart the planet, leaving the Pikmin behind.

In a special epilogue, it is revealed that Louie ate the entire shipment of Pikpik brand carrots he was delivering and falsified his report to the president to avoid trouble, causing the events of the game.

== Development ==
In December 2002 a year following the release of &quot;Pikmin&quot;, game designer Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed a sequel to be in development. Development took about two and a half years; the original plan was to release it in Autumn 2003, but the team chose to delay it by six months to make further changes and revisions. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; was directed both by Shigefumi Hino, who focused on the graphics design, and Masamichi Abe, who focused on the game design. Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka served as producers. Hajime Wakai composed the game soundtrack, while Kazumi Totaka served as the sound director; &quot;Totaka&#x27;s Song&quot; is hidden twice in the game as an Easter egg. The 30-day time limit imposed in the original &quot;Pikmin&quot; was removed in order to allow players to explore the game world at a leisurely pace, which in turn increased the overall length of the game. Cooperative two-player gameplay within the main single player game was experimented, but it was found that it imposed limits on the overall game design. Multiplayer was thus relegated to a separate game mode. &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; was first released in Japan on April 29, 2004 and then in North America, Europe, and Australasia later in the year. Nintendo e-Reader cards compatible with &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; were released only in Japan, which contained additional minigames. Many of the treasures feature product placement for real-life brands such as Duracell. These were replaced with fictional brands in the Nintendo Switch remaster.

=== Re-releases ===
In 2009 both &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; were re-released for the Wii as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; brand, a selection of ported GameCube games with updated Wii Remote controls. Although &quot;New Play Control! Pikmin 2&quot; was released in Japan, Europe, and Australia that year, it was not confirmed for a North American release until three years later in the June 2012 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and was later confirmed for a June 2012 release. The North American localization of &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;″s Wii port was released as a Nintendo Selects game along with the Nintendo Selects re-release of &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; and is the penultimate Wii game to be published by Nintendo of America. HD remasters of &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; for Nintendo Switch were announced and released on June 21, 2023.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
&quot;Pikmin 2&quot; received critical acclaim, gaining an aggregate score of 89.44% on GameRankings based on 58 reviews, and an aggregate score of 90 on Metacritic based on 54 reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube game of August 2004. The February 2006 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated the game as the 47th best game made on a Nintendo System in its Top 200 Games list, and was also rated 29th on &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time. &quot;GamePro&quot; labeled it one of the top five GameCube games. In 2020, &quot;IGN&quot; placed the game at #6 on their list of &quot;the top 20 GameCube games of all time&quot;.

Many critics considered the title to be superior to its predecessor &quot;Pikmin&quot;, expressing that &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; addressed many problems or issues seen in the original game. The removal of the 30-day time limit originally used was applauded by many critics for increasing the game&#x27;s longevity, though Nintendo World Report had mixed opinions, feeling that the lack of urgency might encourage players to be &quot;lazy.&quot; The addition of a separate multiplayer mode was praised, though the lack of LAN online-play was a disappointment to some.

&quot;Pikmin 2&quot;″s strategic and puzzle-oriented gameplay was praised by many. The artificial intelligence of the Pikmin was noted by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as improved over the original, though &quot;IGN&quot; remarked on reoccurring shortcomings, such as Pikmin getting stuck behind walls or breaking away from the group.

The graphics and presentation in &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; were highly praised; many critics felt that they were greatly improved over the original game. &quot;IGN&quot; stated that &quot;it&#x27;s highly refreshing to see a Nintendo-created game with such undeniably high production values,&quot; noting the &quot;photorealistic&quot; environments, particle effects, character animation, and the observation that the game constantly runs at 30 frames-per-second. &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed, expressing that &quot;from a performance viewpoint, &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; stands as an impressive achievement on the GameCube, especially since the improved visuals still move at a solid frame rate despite the increased detail.&quot; Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; &quot;relentlessly and giddily gorgeous.&quot;&quot;&quot; Other critics, such as &quot;X-Play&quot;, did not agree about the graphics, feeling the improvements were &quot;marginal&quot; at best. In addition, many reviews voiced minor complaints regarding the game&#x27;s camera system, which was often obstructed by large objects in the playing field when positioned at certain angles.&quot;&quot;

The staff of &quot;X-Play&quot; nominated &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; for their 2004 &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; for &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;.

===Re-releases===
In his review of the Nintendo Switch version, PJ O&#x27;Reilly of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; described the remaster as &quot;bare-bones&quot;. He particularly lamented the replacement of the licensed brands with fictional ones, claiming that this makes it more difficult for players to notice a connection between Earth and the Pikmin planet. O&#x27;Reilly nonetheless gave the Nintendo Switch remaster an 8/10 score because of the core game&#x27;s quality.

===Sales===
During the first week of its release, &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; sold roughly 162,000 copies, going on to sell 483,000 total copies within Japan. For the New Play Control! rerelease for the Wii, the game sold roughly 237,000 total copies in Japan during its lifetime.

<text>WCMH-TV (channel 4) is a television station in Columbus, Ohio, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Nexstar Media Group. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Olentangy River Road near the Ohio State University campus, and its transmitter is located on Twin Rivers Drive, west of downtown Columbus.

==History==
Columbus&#x27; first television station began operations on April 3, 1949, as WLWC on channel 3. The station&#x27;s original owner was the Cincinnati-based Crosley Broadcasting Corporation, a division of the Avco Company. Crosley also owned WLW radio and WLWT television in Cincinnati, as well as WLWD television (now WDTN) in Dayton. Together these stations comprised the &quot;WLW Television Network&quot;, a regional group of inter-connected stations. Until the mid-1960s, the stations emphasized their connection to each other within their on-air branding; the Columbus station was known as &quot;WLW-C&quot;. The station&#x27;s studios were originally located in the Seneca Hotel in downtown Columbus before WLWC moved into their present facility on Olentangy River Road, five months after the station signed on.

Like all of the WLW television stations in Ohio, WLWC was an NBC affiliate, though it carried some programming from the DuMont network until WTVN-TV (now WSYX) took the DuMont affiliation when that station launched in September 1949. In 1952, following the release of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; which ended the four-year freeze on station license awards, a VHF frequency realignment resulted in WLWC being forced to move to channel 4, trading channels with then-NBC-owned WNBK (now WKYC) in Cleveland; the switch took place in June 1953.

The Crosley TV station group would later grow to include WLWA (now WXIA-TV) in Atlanta, WLWI (now WTHR) in Indianapolis, and WOAI-TV in San Antonio. Along with NBC programming, the Crosley stations in Ohio and Indianapolis also aired common programming, including &quot;The Paul Dixon Show&quot;, &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;, &quot;The Ruth Lyons 50-50 Club&quot; (later to become &quot;The Bob Braun Show&quot;), &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, and telecasts of Cincinnati Reds baseball; WLWC originated coverage of the Ohio State Fair, which was also carried in Cincinnati and Dayton. The Crosley broadcast division took the name of its parent company in 1968, becoming Avco Broadcasting Corporation.

In 1969, the FCC enacted its &quot;one-to-a-market&quot; rule, which prohibited common ownership of AM radio and television stations with overlapping coverage areas under certain conditions while grandfathering some already existing instances. Avco&#x27;s ownership of WLWC, WLWT, WLWD, and WLW radio (a 50,000-watt, clear-channel station which can also be heard throughout much of eastern North America at night) was granted protection under the clause. But as a condition of maintaining three television stations with common coverage areas Crosley/Avco operated WLWC, WLWT, and WLWD with shorter transmission towers. In 1975, Avco announced the sale of its broadcasting outlets; channel 4 was sold in February 1976 to the Providence, Rhode Island–based Outlet Company, who then changed the station&#x27;s call letters to the current WCMH-TV on the 3rd. The call letters were selected to match the IATA airport code for what is now John Glenn Columbus International Airport, &quot;CMH&quot;.


For many years, WLWC/WCMH-TV has shared NBC programming in the eastern part of the market with WHIZ-TV (channel 18) in Zanesville despite channel 4 itself covering Zanesville and covering weather reports as far east as Cambridge (part of the Wheeling, West Virginia–Steubenville, Ohio market and served by WTOV-TV for NBC) and all other major network affiliates in Columbus covering Muskingum County as default affiliates, since Zanesville is considered a separate TV market from Columbus. WHIZ-TV would also serve somewhat as a buffer for WCMH-TV after WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh signed on in 1958 and had to &quot;box in&quot; its signal to protect then-WLWC and three other stations also broadcasting on channel 4.

Outlet merged with NBC in 1996, and channel 4 became an NBC owned-and-operated station, spending much of the next decade as one of two stations in the market to hold this status; the other was UPN&#x27;s WWHO, (channel 53, owned by that network&#x27;s corporate parent Viacom from 1997 to 2005). From 1996 to 1999, channel 4 was technically a sister station to Cleveland&#x27;s WKYC through NBC&#x27;s minority ownership of that station, though they had ceded operational control to Gannett (now Tegna Inc., which now also owns WBNS-TV) by that point.

NBCUniversal placed WCMH-TV on the market January 9, 2006, along with sister stations WJAR in Providence, WVTM-TV in Birmingham, Alabama, and WNCN-TV in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Media General, the Richmond, Virginia-based company which already owned five NBC affiliates in the southeastern United States, announced it would purchase the four stations on April 6, 2006; the sale was finalized on June 26, 2006. As a result, channel 4 became Media General&#x27;s first station in the Great Lakes region.

For several months after the sale closed, WCMH&#x27;s website and those of the other three stations remained in the format used by the websites of NBC-owned stations. In December 2006, WNCN and WJAR launched redesigned websites, which are no longer powered by Internet Broadcasting. On December 11, 2006, WVTM&#x27;s website followed suit, followed by WCMH on December 14. Media General has since located the master control for all Media General NBC affiliates at its Columbus studios. In 2013, Media General migrated its television station web sites to Worldnow (who provided video services to the company&#x27;s in-house web site operations prior to the hosting deal). Following the company&#x27;s takeover by the principal staff of LIN, the Media General station web sites are now hosted by WordPress.com.

With subsequent sales and affiliation switches involving the other three stations NBC sold to Media General in 2006, WCMH was the last of the four that had had both the same owner and the same network affiliation that it had since 2006. (WJAR and WVTM were sold to Sinclair and Hearst Television, respectively, in 2014, while WNCN switched its network affiliation from NBC to CBS in 2016.) WCMH would be reunited with WDTN (the former WLWD) in 2014 when Media General purchased LIN Media, which also made WCMH a sister station to LIN&#x27;s properties in Youngstown (CBS affiliate WKBN-TV, Fox affiliate WYFX-LD, and ABC-affiliated SSA partner WYTV) within Ohio.

On January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced it would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. WCMH became part of &quot;Nexstar Media Group&quot;. The deal closed on January 17, 2017. Following the acquisitions of West Virginia Media Holdings (which closed two weeks after the Media General deal) and Tribune Media in 2019, WCMH is now a sister station to four other stations serving Ohio: Fox affiliate WJW in Cleveland, CBS affiliates WOWK-TV in Charleston–Huntington, West Virginia and WTRF-TV in Wheeling–Steubenville, and NBC affiliate WDTN in Dayton.

== News operation ==

WCMH presently broadcasts 49 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with eight hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the Columbus market&#x27;s television stations on an individual basis, though WSYX currently broadcasts hours of local newscasts per week on both its main signal and WSYX-DT3.

For most of its history, WLWC/WCMH-TV has been second in the Columbus ratings, except for the station&#x27;s 11 p.m. news, which occasionally beats market leader WBNS-TV, though since WBNS-TV&#x27;s sale to Tegna, Inc. in 2019, WCMH has been second behind WSYX, with WBNS-TV&#x27;s ratings having plummeted. Typical with Nexstar-owned stations, WCMH-TV generally carries a straight newscast with emphasis on local coverage; WBNS-TV drifted away from such coverage and more towards lifestyle news under Tegna ownership while WSYX has long favored a more activist-style approach. Channel 4 has also emphasized community involvement and reporters with local roots such as current evening anchor Kerry Charles, a native of Columbus&#x27;s Linden neighborhood.

From 1957 to 1980 Hugh DeMoss anchored channel 4&#x27;s evening newscasts, called &quot;The DeMoss Report&quot;; following the sale of the station to Outlet, the broadcasts were rebranded as &quot;NewsWatch 4&quot;. During the late 70s into the early 80s, the station languished in third place. But channel 4&#x27;s fortunes began to change when, in 1983, the station hired veteran news anchor Doug Adair and his then-wife, reporter Mona Scott, from WKYC-TV in Cleveland as the station&#x27;s main anchoring team. They continued the &quot;happy talk&quot; format as well as launching the 5:30 p.m. newscast. WCMH began a slow rise that would result in the station overcoming WBNS to reach number-one in the market, and in the process, the mid-1980s &quot;NewsWatch 4&quot; team of Adair, Scott, meteorologist Jym Ganahl (with the station from 1979 until retiring in September 2016), and sportscaster Jimmy Crum (who joined the station shortly after its 1949 debut) became the most popular anchor team in Columbus television history. This also coincided with NBC&#x27;s becoming the number one network during that time.

The 1990s brought changes to the normally stable WCMH-TV. In 1990, personal reasons forced Mona Scott to leave channel 4, and she was replaced at the anchor desk by Angela Pace. Pace would leave for WBNS-TV in 1992, and Doug Adair and Jimmy Crum both retired in 1994. WCMH&#x27;s new anchoring team featured Colleen Marshall, who had been a reporter for the station since the mid-1980s; and Cabot Rea, a former weekend sports anchor and weekday features reporter. The pair helmed WCMH-TV&#x27;s evening newscasts until Rea&#x27;s retirement on December 18, 2015. Marshall and Rea worked together overall for 23 years, the longest tenured co-anchoring team in Columbus television history.

The changes resulted in an earlier audience fall-off, but channel 4 once again passed WBNS-TV for the overall lead for a time in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and often won 11 p.m. news ratings over WBNS (due to NBC winning prime time and late night ratings over CBS during those years). For much of the first decade of the new millennium, WCMH also won the morning news race, but the numbers dropped precipitously after the broadcast moved into &quot;NBC 4 on the Square&quot;, a downtown studio facility located on Broad and High streets, in 2008.

On January 4, 2008, WCMH became the second major Columbus station to begin broadcasting local newscasts in high definition. Prior to the opening of &quot;NBC 4 on the Square&quot; on May 27, channel 4 had planned to move its entire news operation to that facility. However, when those plans fell through, WCMH&#x27;s main studio was upgraded to high definition. (Ultimately, &quot;NBC 4 on the Square&quot; was used only for some of the station&#x27;s weekday morning shows.) Like most other stations with high-definition newscasts, WCMH relied mostly on upconverted 16:9 widescreen standard definition footage for its remote field reports until the summer of 2014 where all remote field operations were upgrade to 16:9 1080i HD. On May 11, 2011, &quot;NBC 4 on the Square&quot; came to an end due to dismal ratings (it has remained a distant second to WBNS-TV on weekday mornings ever since &quot;NBC4 on the Square&quot; was founded), with the morning newscast productions returning to the main WCMH facility full-time, and the downtown space was soon leased to WBNS-TV.

In January 2011, the station debuted a new rounded logo and new image promos emphasizing its long-time personalities and community involvement.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


WCMH replaced RTV with MeTV on September 26, 2011, as part of a groupwide affiliation agreement with Media General; the channel replaced RTV on some Media General-owned stations in other markets. MeTV was replaced by Court TV on September 26, 2019. Court TV was replaced with Grit on April 1, 2023.

=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
WCMH-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 14, using virtual channel 4.

===NextGen TV upgrade===
As part of a deal between Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group (owner of WSYX and operator of WTTE and WWHO), on January 7, 2021, WCMH-TV started hosting the ATSC 1.0 channel for WWHO 53.3 as part of Columbus&#x27;s adoption of ATSC 3.0 using the HVEC video compression standard. Simultaneous with the move, WCMH-TV&#x27;s main signal is now broadcasting in ATSC 3.0 on WWHO alongside WWHO&#x27;s main signal, WSYX 6.3 (the former intellectual property of WTTE), and WTTE 28.2. The move left WBNS-TV as the only major network station in Columbus not broadcasting in ATSC 3.0 in some capacity.

<doc id="622292" wikidata="Q4307609" url="?curid=622292" title="Charles Moore, 1st Marquess of Drogheda">
<text>Field Marshal Charles Moore, 1st Marquess of Drogheda (29 June 1730 – 22 December 1822) was a British Army officer and politician. He bore the colours of his regiment at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and later commanded the 18th Light Dragoons during operations against the Whiteboys in Ireland. He also sat as Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons and, having served as Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he went on to become Master-General of the Irish Ordnance.

==Early life==
Moore was the eldest of six sons and two daughters of Edward Moore, 5th Earl of Drogheda and, his first wife, Lady Sarah Ponsonby.

His paternal grandparents were Charles Moore, Lord Moore (a son of Henry Hamilton-Moore, 3rd Earl of Drogheda) and Jane Loftus. His maternal grandparents were the former Sarah Margetson and Brabazon Ponsonby, 1st Earl of Bessborough.

==Career==

Moore joined the Army in 1744 as a cornet in the 12th Dragoons, and bore the colours at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 during the Jacobite risings. He was promoted captain in 1750 and reached the rank of major in 1752 and the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel on 18 January 1755. Promoted to brevet colonel of dragoons on 19 February 1762, Moore became honorary colonel of his regiment on 3 August 1762. He commanded the 18th Light Dragoons during operations against the Whiteboys in Ireland which started in 1762. 

Promoted to major-general on 30 April 1770, Moore became Master-General of the Irish Ordnance and colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Artillery in 1770. Moore served as Muster-Master-General in Ireland from May to November 1807 and was promoted to field marshal on 17 July 1821, aged 91. 

===Political career===
In 1757 Moore became Member of Parliament for St Canice, holding the seat until he succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles in 1758. He was also elected Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1758, a post he held for the next two years. He became Governor of County Meath in January 1759 and lieutenant-colonel commandant of the 19th (later 18th) Light Dragoons on 7 December 1759.

He became Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1763, Governor of Kinsale and Charles Fort in 1765 and a Lord Justice of Ireland in 1766. He was appointed Custos Rotulorum of King&#x27;s County in 1766 and Custos Rotulorum of Queen&#x27;s County in 1769, both offices for life.

He became Member of Parliament for Horsham in 1776, and having been promoted to lieutenant-general on 29 August 1777, he was appointed one of the Founder Knights of the Order of St. Patrick on 17 March 1783.

===Peerage===

Moore succeeded as 6th Earl of Drogheda following the death of his father at sea while travelling from England to Dublin in October 1758.

Created Marquess of Drogheda in the Peerage of Ireland in July 1791 in recognition of the support he had given the Government, Moore was promoted to full general on 12 October 1793. He was appointed one of the joint Postmasters General of Ireland in 1797. In January 1801, he was made Baron Moore, of Moore Place in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Personal life==
On 15 February 1766, Moore married Lady Anne Seymour-Conway, the daughter of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford. He commissioned Moore Abbey as his country home in 1767. They had eight children, including:

* Charles Moore, 2nd Marquess of Drogheda (1770–1837), an MP for Queen&#x27;s County from 1790 to 1791 who died unmarried.
* Lady Elizabeth Emily Moore (1771–1841), who married George Nugent, 7th Earl of Westmeath.
* Hon. Henry Moore (d. 1825), who married Hon. Mary Letitia Parnell, second daughter of Henry Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton, and Lady Caroline Elizabeth Dawson (eldest daughter of the 1st Earl of Portarlington), in 1824.
* Lady Mary Moore (d. 1842), who married Alexander Stewart, of Ards, brother of Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry, and second son of Alexander Stewart, in 1791.
* Lady Gertrude Moore, who died unmarried.
* Lady Frances Moore (d. 1833), who married John Ormsby Vandeleur, in 1800.

He was an important patron of the artist William Ashford. 

Lord Drogheda died in Dublin on 22 December 1821 and was buried at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Drogheda. His wife&#x27;s family had a tradition of mental illness, which may explain the fact that their elder son went insane in his twenties.

===Descendants===
Through his son Henry, he was a grandfather of the Henry Moore, 3rd and last Marquess of Drogheda.

<doc id="622294" wikidata="Q5612201" url="?curid=622294" title="Rod Coronado">
<text>Rodney Adam Coronado (born July 3, 1966) is an indigenous American animal rights and environmental activist known for his militant direct actions in the late 1980s and 1990s. As part of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, he sank two whaling ships and destroyed Iceland&#x27;s sole whale-processing facility in 1986. He led the Animal Liberation Front&#x27;s Operation Bite Back campaign against the fur industry and its supporting institutions in the early 1990s, which was involved in multiple firebombings. Following an attack on a Michigan State University mink research center in early 1992, Coronado was jailed for nearly five years. He later admitted to being the sole perpetrator. The 1992 federal Animal Enterprise Protection Act was created in response to his actions. The operation continued with a focus on liberating animals rather than property destruction. Coronado also worked with Earth First.

His activism continued in the 2000s. He was jailed another eight months in 2004 for sabotaging an Arizona mountain lion hunt and was targeted under an anti-terrorism law in 2006 for having recounted details of his Michigan State incendiary device in a public setting. During his active sentence, he renounced violent tactics, influenced by years of imprisonment and his new fatherhood. He served an additional year for the incendiary device charge and an additional four months for a probation violation. Since 2013, Coronado has been involved in gray wolf conservation in the contiguous United States. He founded Wolf Patrol, a nonprofit that monitors treatment of wolves and reports illegal wolf hunting.

== Early life and activism ==

Rod Coronado was born in 1966 of Pascua Yaqui Indigenous ancestry and raised in California. (He was not registered with the tribe as of 2006 for political reasons.) As a child, he was teased for his love of nature. Among his formative experiences, the television video of a Canadian commercial seal hunt affected him deeply. He joined the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an anti-whaling activist direct action group, as a teenager. Coronado later joined the radical environmentalist group Earth First!, and the Animal Liberation Front, an underground animal rights group that released animals from fur farms and research facilities.

In November 1986, Rod Coronado and David Howitt sunk two whaling ships in Reykjavík harbor and sabotaged Iceland&#x27;s sole whale-processing facility in Hvalfjord. The two members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society had spent weeks in Iceland working at a fish processing factory and plotting their action. On November 8, the pair dismantled the Hvalfjord facility&#x27;s computer files, refrigeration, and laboratory equipment with cyanic acid and sledgehammers over eight hours. They drove 50 miles south to Reykjavík, where they boarded two of the whaling company&#x27;s four ships and opened their sea valves. Watchmen prevented them from accessing the other ships. Coronado and Howitt fled to Luxembourg via plane. About $2 million in damage had been done (equivalent to $ million in ).

Coronado designed and led the Animal Liberation Front&#x27;s early 1990s campaign against the fur industry and its supporting research institutions, known as Operation Bite Back. The first attack, in June 1991, was arson on Oregon State University&#x27;s experimental mink farm, burning research records and leading to the facility&#x27;s closure. Within a week, another attack firebombed the Edmonds, Washington, Northwest Farm Food Cooperative, which supplied mink feed. In August, activists attacked a Washington State University mink farm. In February 1992, Coronado and two other Animal Liberation Front activists burned a Michigan State University mink research center, causing $200,000 in damages and incinerating 32 years of research. In 1995, Coronado was sentenced to 57 months of jail, three years probation, and a $2 million fine. Coronado had said that he was not involved in the attack apart from serving as a spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front, and took the lesser charge of aiding in the attack to avoid a trial and drop charges from other attacks. Only 25 years later did Coronado admit to being the attack&#x27;s sole perpetrator. The campaign continued during his imprisonment with a focus on freeing animals rather than economic sabotage. The 1992 federal Animal Enterprise Protection Act, which was built to protect animal-based businesses, had been crafted largely in response to Coronado. While in prison, Coronado created and wrote the magazine &quot;Strong Hearts&quot;.

Following threats of mountain lions looming in the foothills of Tucson, the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced a hunt within the Sabino Canyon area on March 10, 2004. With split scientific opinion on the merit of lion relocation and ten days of protests, the department attempted to move the lions but found few tracks. The climax of the protests was Coronado&#x27;s arrest, on March 24, for spreading lion scent in the park to sabotage tracking dogs. The hunt was called off four days later. Coronado, Earth First activist Matthew Crozier, and an &quot;Esquire&quot; journalist accompanying them were charged with trespassing during an emergency order of closure and interfering with an officer. From 2006 to 2007, Coronado served eight months of a ten-month federal sentence.

Amidst the backdrop of the Green Scare, a period of federal crackdown on radical environmental and animal rights activism, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Coronado in February 2006 as part of its Operation Backfire. Years prior, in August 2003, Coronado gave a speech in San Diego on activist rights that the FBI recorded. In response to an audience question about the Michigan State arson, Coronado used a nearby juice container to explain how the incendiary device worked. A grand jury led to charges that Coronado demonstrated an explosive device with intent to commit a crime.

Fatherhood and years of imprisonment changed Coronado&#x27;s priorities. Later in 2006, before the incendiary device case went to court and while serving time for the mountain lion case, Coronado wrote an open letter from prison renouncing violence as a means for social pressure in consideration of how legal efforts and prison time had affected his life, family, and young children. This approach was a departure for Coronado, who by now was an underground celebrity among environmental and animal rights radicals. He had become known for his illegal direct actions and longstanding public advocacy for militant tactics, with prominent recent appearances on national television (&quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2005) and speaking at an American University (2003). But parenting, he wrote, makes parents &quot;practice the very principles [they] seek to teach [their] children&quot;.
The incendiary device case ended as a mistrial with a hung jury. He pled guilty and in March 2008 was sentenced to a year of prison in exchange for other dropped cases and to &quot;move on with [his] life&quot;, having already committed to a changed outlook on violence. Coronado was released in 2009. The next year, a judge sent him back to prison for four months after Coronado was found to have friended activist Mike Roselle on Facebook in violation of his probation.

Coronado has been involved with grey wolf conservation in the contiguous United States since 2013. He founded Wolf Patrol, a non-profit environmental group that monitors treatment of wolves and reports illegal wolf hunting.

== Personal life ==
Coronado was married in 2007 and has two children: a son born in 2001 and his wife&#x27;s daughter, born prior to their partnership.

<text>WWHO (channel 53) is a television station licensed to Chillicothe, Ohio, United States, serving the Columbus area as an affiliate of The CW. It is owned by Manhan Media, Inc., which maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of ABC/MyNetworkTV/Fox affiliate WSYX (channel 6), for the provision of certain services. Sinclair also operates TBD station WTTE (channel 28) under a separate LMA with Cunningham Broadcasting; however, Sinclair effectively owns WTTE as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The three stations share studios on Dublin Road in Grandview Heights (with a Columbus mailing address); WWHO&#x27;s transmitter is located in the Franklinton section of Columbus.

WWHO also served briefly as the default CW affiliate (on cable) for the Zanesville media market from March 2008 through early July 2008, after WHIZ-TV discontinued WBZV, its cable-only CW Plus affiliate. The CW Plus has since been reinstated to the Zanesville cable line-up via a Spectrum-provided cable-only CW Plus feed branded as &quot;Zanesville CW 13&quot; in the market, which has no connections to WHIZ-TV. WWHO served as the &quot;de facto&quot; over-the-air WB affiliate for the Dayton, Ohio, media market until 1999, when WBDT (then a primary Pax affiliate) joined The WB; which relegated Pax to a secondary affiliation. WWHO also provided UPN service to much of the Dayton market over the air until 2006, when The CW was launched.

==History==

The station began operating on August 31, 1987, as an independent station using the call letters WWAT, named after its owner, Wendell A. Triplett. It filled in a void created when future sister station WTTE joined Fox in 1986. The station originally operated from studios located on River Road (US 23) in Chillicothe. It operated a Columbus translator on W17AI channel 17 (now WDEM, which is still owned by Triplett) until 1992, when WWAT was added to many cable providers in the Columbus market due to cable must-carry legislation. It quickly established itself as a solid competitor to WTTE, despite its signal limitations.

Triplett sold the station to Fant Broadcasting for $2 million in 1994 and changed its calls to WWHO on April 15, when the on-air name &quot;Who-53&quot; was adopted. At the same time, the station entered a local marketing agreement with NBC affiliate WCMH-TV (channel 4, then owned by The Outlet Company). Until 1998, WWHO also served as an alternate NBC affiliate, airing the network&#x27;s programming when WCMH was unable, due to its annual broadcast of Columbus&#x27; July 4 fireworks display &quot;Red, White &amp; BOOM!&quot; or long-form breaking news coverage; an arrangement which began in 1996 concurrent with NBC&#x27;s purchase of WCMH.

WWHO remained an independent station until January 11, 1995, when it became a charter affiliate of The WB Television Network. WWHO (then branded on-air as &quot;WB 53&quot;) retained this affiliation until the Paramount Stations Group (a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, whose parent company was Viacom) agreed to acquire the station in 1997, along with sister station WLWC in Providence, Rhode Island, and sell WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut, to NBC in return; WCMH-TV ended the LMA at this time and WWHO was operated independently afterwards. At that time the station became a secondary UPN affiliate, as UPN programming was moved from WTTE, primarily a Fox affiliate, to WWHO; while channel 53 retained a primary WB affiliation through the duration of its contract, the station nonetheless soon began calling itself &quot;UPN 53&quot;. In the fall of 1998, WWHO began to carry programming in the overnight hours from the upstart Pax TV network (now Ion Television), as Pax struggled to find a full-power affiliate in the Columbus market. This arrangement ended in February 1999, when Pax affiliated with WSFJ-TV (channel 51) in Newark, Ohio. In 2000, WWHO switched its primary affiliation to UPN, but signed a deal with The WB to retain its prime time programming on a secondary basis through what a Paramount Stations Group executive described as a &quot;program license agreement&quot;. The station dropped the channel number from its branding in 2002, becoming &quot;UPN Columbus&quot;. On February 10, 2005, it was announced that the Viacom Television Stations Group (the successor to the Paramount Stations Group as a result of Viacom merging with CBS in 1999) was selling WWHO and WNDY-TV (in the Indianapolis market) to LIN Television for $85 million, concurrent with a rebranding of the station as &quot;UPN 53 WWHO&quot;.

The rebrand proved to be short-lived, as UPN and The WB merged to form The CW in 2006. WWHO was the obvious choice as Columbus&#x27; CW affiliate since it already carried both UPN and WB programming. However, when the first list of affiliates outside the core group of CBS-owned UPN affiliates and Tribune-owned WB affiliates was announced, WWHO was not on the list. After some delay, LIN eventually agreed to affiliate four of its WB and UPN affiliates, including WWHO, with The CW, making WWHO the largest The CW affiliate owned by LIN. (WSYX, the area&#x27;s ABC affiliate (and sister station to WTTE), launched a new digital subchannel featuring programming from MyNetworkTV in September of that year.)

On July 31, approximately one month before The CW officially debuted, WWHO rebranded with a new logo and slogan, &quot;The CW on WWHO-TV&quot;. Once more, the station&#x27;s channel number was de-emphasized. The station today currently goes by &quot;The CW Columbus&quot;. Kids&#x27; WB and The CW Daytime returned to WWHO after being absent from Columbus for five years.

In November 2011, it was reported that the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the owner of WSYX and who also effectively owns WTTE, was in talks to purchase WWHO from LIN for an estimated $7 million. This deal, if it were approved, would have given Sinclair control of four of the six largest network affiliations in the Ohio capital. This deal never materialized, however, and LIN filed instead to sell the station to Manhan Media. The sale was granted on December 20, 2011. In February 2012, after consummating the sale, Manhan Media entered into a shared services agreement (SSA) with Sinclair, making WWHO a sister station to WSYX and WTTE. (Manhan Media&#x27;s owner, Stephen P. Mumblow, subsequently started Deerfield Media to acquire the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assets, including the licenses, of several stations that are being divested by Sinclair in the wake of its purchase of stations from Newport Television. However, Sinclair would retain control of those stations through a local marketing agreement.) In a way, the LMA also reunited WWHO with WLWC, which Sinclair owned outright until April 2013 when that station was sold to OTA Broadcasting, LLC. Although Sinclair now controls WWHO, it initially continued to operate from separate studios several blocks east of the WSYX/WTTE studios; by October 2013, WWHO had moved in with WSYX/WTTE.

Due to a conflict on Bally Sports Ohio, WWHO aired a Reds game on April 4, 2023.

==News operation==
WWHO has never produced its own newscasts, but has aired newscasts from all of Columbus&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; stations.

When WCMH-TV entered into the LMA to run WWHO, the deal included producing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast using WCMH-TV&#x27;s facilities and resources. This made WWHO the first station in the market to air a 10 p.m. newscast; WTTE (then owned by Sinclair outright) did not air any newscasts until Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of WSYX in 1996, though sister station WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh launched a 10 p.m. newscast around the same time, meaning Sinclair may have started a news department at WTTE if not for acquiring WSYX. The 10 p.m. newscast lasted until 1998 when NBC ended its LMA with WWHO and Viacom took over the non-licensed assets of the station.

On February 10, 2005, LIN Television announced its intention to bring 10 p.m. news back to the station. This half-hour newscast was produced by WBNS-TV, and debuted on September 1, 2005. Unlike WCMH in previous years, WBNS chose to use its own station branding on the newscast rather than WWHO&#x27;s, including WBNS&#x27; normal &quot;10TV News HD&quot; graphics beginning in 2007 (despite the fact WWHO&#x27;s newscast was not broadcast in HD until mid-2008). On December 31, 2008, WBNS ceased production of WWHO&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast.

Currently, WWHO repeats the WSYX &quot;ABC 6 News at 11&quot; weeknights at midnight. It also airs the 10 p.m. &quot;Fox 28&quot; newscast on an overflow basis when Fox Sports programming would preempt it on WSYX-DT3; no alternate branding noting WWHO&#x27;s affiliation is used on those nights.

On January 18, 2021, WWHO began airing &quot;The National Desk&quot;, a Sinclair-produced national morning newscast sourced from Sinclair stations nationwide. &quot;The National Desk&quot; is similar in format to &quot;NewsNation&quot; produced by WCMH-TV parent Nexstar Media Group, and competes locally with all of the network&#x27;s morning news shows (including &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on WSYX&#x27;s main channel) as well as the local morning news on WSYX 6.3 that is an extension of the main channel&#x27;s morning news. In September 2021, it also began to carry the evening edition of &quot;The National Desk&quot; for an hour after CW programming.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Columbus television stations:
=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
WWHO was one of only two full-power television stations in the Columbus market (the other being WTTE) that honored the original DTV transition date of February 17, 2009. The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 53, at 11:59 p.m. on that date, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 46, using virtual channel 53.

For around two weeks after the official shutoff, the station was in nightlight mode, carrying the National Association of Broadcasters DTV transition video and local resources about the switchover and how to resolve reception issues for Sinclair&#x27;s local stations.

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse===

On January 7, 2021, WWHO was launched as ATSC 3.0 multiplex lighthouse for the Columbus area. Its ATSC 1.0 signals began being housed between WTTE and WCMH-TV. The same day saw the Fox programming formerly on WTTE&#x27;s main channel moved to WSYX-DT3, meaning that WWHO&#x27;s channel spectrum currently hosts programming from four of the six major networks. The ATSC 3.0 signal includes three unique channels: T2, a FAST spinoff of Sinclair-owned Tennis Channel mapped at 6.10; PickleballTV, a sister channel to T2 focusing on pickleball mapped at 6.11; and GameLoop, an interactive video game-focused channel that has playable versions of games such as &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Tetris&quot; mapped at 6.20.

<doc id="622300" wikidata="Q555313" url="?curid=622300" title="Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar">
<text>Prince William Augustus Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, , (11 October 1823 – 16 November 1902) was a British military officer of German descent. After a career in the Grenadier Guards, he became Major General commanding the Brigade of Guards and General Officer Commanding the Home District in 1870, General Officer Commanding Southern District in October 1878 and Commander-in-Chief, Ireland in October 1885. He was promoted to field marshal in 1897 despite his career including no great military achievements.

==Career==
Edward was born to Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Princess Ida of Saxe-Meiningen at Bushy House, the home of his mother&#x27;s sister Adelaide and her husband the future William IV of the United Kingdom.

After being naturalised as a British subject, Edward&#x27;s military career began on 1 June 1841, when, having trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he joined the 67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign. He was promoted to ensign in the Grenadier Guards and lieutenant in the Army on 8 June 1841 and lieutenant in his regiment and captain in the Army on 19 May 1846 before becoming adjutant of his battalion in November 1850.

Edward was promoted to brevet major in the Grenadier Guards on 20 June 1854. He served in the Crimean War and fought at the Battle of Alma in September 1854 and the Siege of Sevastopol in October 1854, where he was slightly injured. He fought on at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854 and the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel &quot;for distinguished Service in the Field&quot; during the war on 12 December 1854.

Edward was appointed an aide-de-camp to the Queen and received his colonelcy in the Grenadier Guards on 5 October 1855. Granted the style of Serene Highness (to both Edward and his wife) in 1866, he was promoted to major-general on 6 March 1868. He was appointed Major General commanding the Brigade of Guards and General Officer Commanding the Home District in 1870 and, having been promoted to lieutenant general on 6 July 1877, he became General Officer Commanding Southern District in October 1878. Promoted to full general on 4 November 1879, he went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and a member of the Irish Privy Council in October 1885 before retiring in October 1890.

In retirement Edward was a commissioner of the Patriotic Fund. He also became colonel of the 10th Regiment of Foot and then colonel of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards. He was promoted to field marshal on 22 June 1897 following which there was adverse comment in &quot;The Times&quot; that his career had included no great military achievements.

Prince and Princess Edward had for several years a summer residence at North Berwick, and in October 1902 the Prince was honoured with the Freedom of the Royal burgh of North Berwick, a week after he had hosted King Edward VII as his guest there for a couple of days.

Edward died on 16 November 1902 at Portland Place in London and was buried in Chichester Cathedral, in the crypt of his wife&#x27;s family, the dukes of Richmond and Lennox.

On 27 November 1851 Edward married, morganatically, Lady Augusta Katherine Gordon-Lennox, (a daughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond), who was created Countess of Dornburg by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar the day before the wedding. The Court Circular shows that she was usually known by that title until early 1886, when the Circular began to consistently refer to her by her husband&#x27;s title, i.e. &quot;HSH Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar&quot;. They had no children.

<doc id="622304" wikidata="Q454802" url="?curid=622304" title="Ernesto Laclau">
<text>Ernesto Laclau (; 6 October 1935 – 13 April 2014) was an Argentine political theorist and philosopher. He is often described as an &#x27;inventor&#x27; of post-Marxist political theory. He is well known for his collaborations with his long-term partner, Chantal Mouffe.

He studied history at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, graduating with a licenciatura in 1964, and received a PhD from the University of Essex in 1977.

From 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided a research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of Saussure, and Derrida), post-analytic thought (Wittgenstein, and Richard Rorty) and psychoanalysis (primarily the work of Lacan) to provide innovative analysis of concrete political phenomena, such as identities, discourses and hegemonies. This theoretical and analytical orientation is known today as the &#x27;Essex School of discourse analysis&#x27;.

Over his career Laclau lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. He also held positions at SUNY Buffalo and Northwestern University, both in the US.

== Biography ==
Laclau studied history at the University of Buenos Aires and was a member of the PSIN (Socialist Party of the National Left) until 1969, when the British historian Eric Hobsbawm supported his entrance to Oxford. He had close links with Jorge Abelardo Ramos, the founder of the PSIN, although he stated in 2005 that the latter had evolved in a direction he did not appreciate. In the same interview, he claimed that he came from a Yrigoyenista family, and that the Peronist politician Arturo Jauretche, a strong opponent of Justo&#x27;s dictatorship during the Infamous Decade of the 1930s, was a close friend of his father.

In his later years, he had close ties with the Argentine Socialist Confederation (Spanish: &quot;Confederación Socialista Argentina&quot;), and in Argentina he is associated with Peronism.

Laclau died of a heart attack in Seville in 2014.

== Work ==
Laclau&#x27;s early work was influenced by Althusserian Marxism and focused on issues debated within Neo-Marxist circles in the 1970s, such as the role of the state, the dynamics of capitalism, the importance of building popular movements, and the possibility of revolution. Laclau&#x27;s most significant book is &quot;Hegemony and Socialist Strategy&quot;, which he co-authored with Chantal Mouffe in 1985. The position outlined in this book is usually described as post-Marxist because it rejects (a) Marxist economic determinism and (b) the view that class struggle is the most important antagonism in society. In their 2001 introduction to the second edition Laclau and Mouffe commented on this label, stating that whilst &quot;&#x27;post&quot;-Marxist&#x27; they were also &#x27;post-&quot;Marxist&quot;&#x27;: their work, though a departure from traditional Western Marxism, retained similar concerns and ideas. A key innovation in &quot;Hegemony and Socialist Strategy&quot; was Laclau and Mouffe&#x27;s argument that left-wing movements need to build alliances with a wide variety of different groups if they are to be successful and establish a left-wing &#x27;hegemony&#x27;. In the final chapter of the book, the project of &quot;radical and plural democracy&quot; was advocated: a democracy in which subjects accept the importance of the values of liberty and equality, but fight over what the terms mean.

In &quot;Hegemony and Socialist Strategy&quot; Laclau and Mouffe also offered a constructivist account of &#x27;discourse&#x27;. By drawing on the work of the later Wittgenstein, they argued that social entities only become meaningful through both linguistic and non-linguistic discursive articulation. As such, the meaning of something is never pre-given but is, instead, constructed through social practices. In a later summary of his view, Laclau claims there is support for this broad sense of discourse in Saussure. &quot;By discourse... I do not mean something that is essentially restricted to the areas of speech and writing, but any complex of elements in which relations play the constitutive role. This means that elements do not pre-exist the relational complex but are constituted through it. Thus &#x27;relation&#x27; and &#x27;objectivity&#x27; are synonymous. Saussure asserted that there are no positive terms in language, only differences — something is what it is only through its differential relations to something else.&quot;

Laclau subsequently used this account of discourse to re-consider the nature of identity, arguing that all political identities are discursive - even if they are experienced by individuals as &#x27;natural&#x27; (even to the point where one&#x27;s identity is not recognised as an identity). For example, though an individual may think that they are just &#x27;born male&#x27; this is, for Laclau not the case: &#x27;maleness&#x27; is a socially constructed category that has no innate meaning.

In his more recent works Laclau returned to a topic that was prevalent in his earliest writings: populism. In &quot;On Populist Reason&quot;, Laclau considered the nature of populism in political discourse, the creation of a popular hegemonic bloc such as &quot;the people&quot;, and the importance of affect in politics. Building on his earlier work, Laclau argued that the basis of populism lies in the creation of &quot;empty signifiers&quot;: words and ideas that express a universal idea of justice, and symbolically structure the political environment. Against those who see populism as a threat to democracy, Laclau argued that it is an essential component of it.

=== Relationship with Slavoj Žižek===
Laclau is known for his long standing dialogue with Lacanian &quot;arch-Marxist&quot; Slavoj Žižek. This dates back to at least 1989, when Laclau wrote the introduction to Žižek&#x27;s first book in English (&quot;The Sublime Object of Ideology&quot;). Žižek is widely recognized as responsible for Laclau&#x27;s increased acceptance of Lacanian ideas and his essay &quot;Beyond Discourse Analysis&quot;, which was published in Laclau&#x27;s &quot;New Reflections on the Revolutions of Our Time&quot; (1990), provided a psychoanalytic critique of Laclau&#x27;s work. In 2000, Laclau, Žižek and Judith Butler published the trialogue &quot;Contingency, Hegemony, Universality&quot;, in which each responded to the others&#x27; works in a three-essay cycle. Although Žižek and Laclau noted their similarities and mutual respect, significant political and theoretical differences emerged between all three interlocutors. Following several acrimonious publications in the early 2000s, Laclau wrote in &quot;On Populist Reason&quot; (2005) that Žižek had an impractical and confused approach to politics, describing him as &quot;waiting for the Martians&quot;. Their disagreement escalated in the pages of &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot; in 2006, when in a spate of essays the two argued in an increasingly hostile manner about political action, Marxism and class struggle, Hegel, populism, and the Lacanian Real. More recently in a 2014 interview with David Howarth, Laclau stated that his relationship with Žižek had deteriorated due to the latter adopting a &quot;frantic ultra-Leftist stance, wrapped in a Leninism of kindergarten&quot;.

<text>Julian Eltinge (May 14, 1881 – March 7, 1941), born William Julian Dalton, was an American stage and film actor and female impersonator. After appearing in the Boston Cadets Revue at the age of ten in feminine garb, Eltinge garnered notice from producers and made his first appearance on Broadway in 1904. As his star began to rise, he appeared in vaudeville and toured Europe and the United States, even giving a command performance before King Edward VII. Eltinge appeared in a series of musical comedies written specifically for his talents starting in 1910 with &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot;, returning to vaudeville in 1918. His popularity soon earned him the moniker &quot;Mr. Lillian Russell&quot; for the popular beauty and musical comedy star.

Hollywood beckoned Eltinge and in 1917 he appeared in his first feature film, &quot;The Countess Charming&quot;. This led to other films, including 1918&#x27;s &quot;The Isle of Love&quot; with Rudolph Valentino and Virginia Rappe. By the time Eltinge arrived in Hollywood, he was considered one of the highest paid actors on the American stage; but with the arrival of the Great Depression and the death of vaudeville, Eltinge&#x27;s star began to fade. He continued his show in nightclubs but found little success. He died in 1941 at his Manhattan apartment ten days after a show at a nearby nightclub.

==Early years==

Eltinge was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts, to Julia Edna Baker and Michael Joseph Dalton. It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in Butte, Montana. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women&#x27;s clothing and performed in saloons patronized by ranchers and miners. Upon discovering this in 1899, his father beat him and his mother sent him back to Boston, where the 17-year-old worked in dry goods as a salesman while studying dance.

The early film star Pauline Frederick and Eltinge were childhood friends. They met up again at boarding school in Boston when Eltinge was already making a name for himself on the vaudeville stage. He dared her to apply to one of the music halls, which was the start of her career on stage and in films.

Most sources cite his first female role originally having been at the age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to how he came to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking cakewalk lessons from a Mrs. Wyman&#x27;s dance studio when he demonstrated to his teacher a remarkable ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged William to study the art of female impersonation.
==Broadway and vaudeville==
Eltinge&#x27;s first appearance on Broadway was in the musical comedy &quot;Mr. Wix of Wickham&quot; which opened September 19, 1904 at the Bijou Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by E. E. Rice and included music by Jerome Kern among others.

During this time, Eltinge began performing in vaudeville. Unlike many of the female impersonation acts that existed at that time, like Bert Savoy, Eltinge did not present a caricature of women but presented the illusion of actually being a woman. He toured simply as &quot;Eltinge&quot; which left his sex unknown and his act included singing, dancing and quick costume changes in a variety of female roles, including a Gibson Girl-like role called &quot;The Sampson Girl&quot;. At the conclusion of his performances, he would remove his wig, revealing his true nature to the surprise of the often unknowing audience.

In 1906, Eltinge made his London debut at the Palace Theater. While in London, Eltinge gave a performance for King Edward VII, who later presented him with a white bulldog. The next year, Eltinge made his New York debut at the Alhambra Theater to critical acclaim. From 1908-09, he toured with Cohan and Harris Minstrels.

By 1910, Eltinge had reached the height of his fame. Sime Silverman, Editor of &quot;Variety&quot;, called him &quot;as great a performer as there is today&quot;.

==&quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot; and beyond==

In 1911, Eltinge opened one of his most famous shows, &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot;, at New York&#x27;s Liberty Theater. In it, he played Hal Blake who disguises himself as &quot;Mrs. Monte&quot; in a &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;-like plot. The show only ran 56 performances in New York, but toured the nation successfully for several years.

The success of this show led producer A. H. Woods to give Eltinge one of the entertainment industry&#x27;s highest honors, having a theatre named for him. A year to the day that &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot; opened, Woods opened the Eltinge Theatre on New York&#x27;s 42nd Street designed by noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb. Eltinge himself never performed in his namesake building. After serving as a legitimate theater for many years, it became a notorious burlesque house and was shut down during a &quot;public morality&quot; campaign in 1943, before becoming a cinema the next year. The theater is now part of the AMC Empire 25 cineplex having been lifted and moved in its entirety down the block from its original location.

Following on the success of &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot;, Eltinge performed in two other comedies that had similar success, &quot;The Crinoline Girl&quot; which opened in 1914 and &quot;Cousin Lucy&quot; (with music by Kern) the next year.

==Hollywood and film career==
In 1914, Eltinge starred in silent picture versions of &quot;The Crinoline Girl&quot; followed by &quot;Cousin Lucy&quot; the next year. According to Anthony Slide&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville&quot;, he also had a cameo role in a film entitled &quot;How Molly Malone Made Good&quot; in 1915. Eltinge&#x27;s first real screen success came in 1917 in &quot;The Countess Charming&quot;. His role in the film was again a double role with him playing both a male and said male in female garb.

Settling in Hollywood, Eltinge made three films in 1917 and also in 1918. During this time he wrote and produced a vaudeville group called &quot;The Julian Eltinge Players&quot;. With this group he returned to the vaudeville stage appearing at New York City&#x27;s Palace Theatre in 1918, where he was paid one of the highest salaries in show business: $3,500 a week. The next year he returned again in a new vaudeville review with sets by the French designer Erté.

By 1920, Eltinge was very wealthy and was living in one of the most lavish mansions in Southern California, &quot;Villa Capistrano&quot;. He appeared with Rudolf Valentino in the 1920 film &quot;An Adventuress&quot; (released as &quot;The Isle of Love&quot; in the U.S.). After filming, Eltinge continued touring onstage and did so until 1927. He also made two films, &quot;Madame Behave&quot; and &quot;The Fascinating Widow&quot;, in 1925.

==Personal life==

Despite the graceful femininity he exhibited on stage, Eltinge used a supermasculine facade in public to combat the rumours of his homosexuality. This sexual duality led to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; drama critic Percy Hammond&#x27;s using the term &quot;ambisextrous&quot; to describe him.

Eltinge may have been gay, as Milton Berle and many others who worked with him believed. Actress Ruth Gordon stated in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that he was &quot;as virile as anybody virile.&quot; There is no existing record of a lover of either sex, though stories did abound.

==Later years and death==
Eltinge was one of many show-business figures to be hit hard by the 1929 stock market crash. By the 1930s, the female impersonations that he had built his career on had begun to lose popularity, as did vaudeville in general. Eltinge resorted to performing in nightclubs. Crackdowns on cross-dressing in public – an attempt to curb homosexual activity – prevented Eltinge from performing in costume.

On February 25, 1941, Eltinge fell ill while performing at Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in New York City. He was taken home and died in his apartment ten days later on March 7. His death certificate lists the cause of death as a cerebral hemorrhage.

<text>Ludlow is a ghost town in Las Animas County, Colorado, United States. It was the site of the Ludlow Massacre–part of the Colorado Coalfield War–in 1914. The town site is located at the entrance to a canyon in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It is located along the western side of Interstate 25 approximately 12 miles (19 km) north of the town of Trinidad. Nearby points of interest include the Ludlow Monument, a monument to the coal miners and their families who were killed in the 1914 massacre, the Hastings coke ovens, and the Victor American Hastings Mine Disaster Monument.

Robert Adams made a series of photographs in Ludlow in 1981. In June 2009, the Ludlow Tent Colony Site was dedicated as a National Historic Landmark by Department of the Interior in a ceremony attended by Governor Bill Ritter following approval in January of that year.

==History==
A road and standard-gauge railroad was built through Ludlow in 1888 by the Denver, Texas, and Fort Worth Railroad, which would later become the Colorado &amp; Southern.

===Ludlow Massacre===

On 20 April 1914, after months of sporadic violence and the withdrawal of a larger contingent of troops a few days before, Colorado National Guardsmen and local militia fired on strikers participating in the United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company. Roughly 20 occupants of the colony, including at least 12 women and children, were killed––mostly by smoke inhalation in the ensuing conflagration. Also among the dead was Greek labor-organizer Louis Tikas. A single Guardsman is known to have been killed by gunfire from the strikers. The violence at Ludlow sparked the most intense period of violence of the Colorado Coalfield War, which lasted until President Woodrow Wilson ordered troops into Colorado to end the fighting on 29 April.

<doc id="622309" wikidata="Q2740208" url="?curid=622309" title="Severn, Ontario">
<text>Severn is a township in south-central Ontario, Canada, located between Lake Couchiching, and the Severn River (both are part of the Trent–Severn Waterway) in Simcoe County.

==Communities==

The township comprises the communities of Amigo Beach, Ardtrea, Buckskin, Buena Vista Park, Burnside, Carlyon, Coldwater, Cumberland Beach, Fesserton, Hamlet, Hampshire Mills, Happyland, Hawkins Corner, Hydro Glen, Lovering, Maple Valley, Marchmont, Menoke Beach, Mordolphin, Mount Stephen, Port Severn, Port Stanton, Scarlet Park, Severn Bridge, Severn Falls, Sparrow Lake, Swift Rapids, Uhthoff, the Uhthoff Hunt Camp, Wilson Point, and Washago.

==History==

Chief John Aisance and his band of Chippewas (also known as Ojibwa) settled along the Coldwater River in 1830, calling the place &quot;Gissinausebing&quot;, which means &quot;cold water.&quot; They built a grist mill on the site in 1833, which the Native people owned until 1849. In 1835 a post office was established, and the community was called Coldwater.

Coldwater was opened to European settlement in 1836, and was incorporated as a village in 1908. Three weekly newspapers have been published in the community: the &quot;Coldwater Planet&quot; (1896 to 1928), the &quot;Coldwater News&quot; (1895 to 1956); and the &quot;Coldwater Canadian&quot; in 1956.

At the mouth of the Severn River, another community sprang up. The residents called it Severn Mills after a sawmill was built there around 1850. Lumber from this area was sent out on ships. The village was renamed to Port Severn in 1868. In 1875, the Georgian Bay Lumber Co. was formed, soon to become the major lumber producer in the Severn River watershed.

The settlement expanded rapidly over the next 20 years. In 1896, the mill was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Since the timber supply in the area had been greatly reduced, the mill was not rebuilt and the population of the village began to decline. With the completion of the Trent–Severn Waterway in this area in 1915, economic activity shifted from lumber to tourism.

The current township of Severn was founded on January 1, 1994, as part of the restructuring of Simcoe County, by amalgamating the village of Coldwater with the townships of Matchedash and Orillia, plus portions of the townships of Medonte and Tay.

== Demographics ==

<text>HMS &quot;Ashanti&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was named after the Ashanti people, an ethnic group located in Ghana. The frigate was sunk as a target in 1988.

&quot;Ashanti&quot; was built by Yarrow, of Scotstoun, at a cost of £5,315,000 and was the first commissioned Royal Navy warship to be equipped with combined steam and gas (COSAG) engines. She was launched on 9 March 1959 and commissioned on 23 November 1961.

==Operational Service==
In 1962 malicious damage was reported aboard &quot;Ashanti&quot;.

&quot;Ashanti&quot; deployed to the Caribbean for trials in 1962. There, in early October, the ship suffered a failure in her COSAG engines, forcing the frigate&#x27;s return to Britain. Subsequent tests discovered that the COSAG&#x27;s machinery was defective, which caused blade fracturing in the gas turbine. Hull strengthening also found to be required

&quot;Ashanti&quot; was also used to trial the Westland Wasp helicopter, prior to its introduction to active service in 1964. The frigate conducted operations in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea for 10 months in 1963. In May 1965, &quot;Ashanti&quot; suffered minor damage in a collision with the Russian cargo ship &quot;Farab&quot; in the port of Mombassa, Kenya.

In 1966/67 &quot;Ashanti&quot; was deployed on the Beira Patrol. During that time she also spent two months in Aden having a gas turbine refit whilst some of the crew were detached to the army as Britain withdrew from Aden, for which the crew were awarded the General Service medal with South Arabia clasp. There was also a visit to the Kuria Muria Islands, before going on to Bahrain and Kuwait. Given the Six-Day War, the Suez Canal being blocked, indecisiveness about whether to clear mines from the Gulf of Aqaba &quot;Ashanti&quot; headed home via the Cape of Good Hope, stopping off at Simon&#x27;s Town. Paragraph by onboard rating REM Bryant.

Copied by REM Bryant from 

HMS Ashanti Alongside Steamer Point harbour late August/early September 1966. Under repair Steamer Point all of Jan/Feb 1967 and many parties of the ship&#x27;s company detached to military units during this time, specifically 3rd Bn The Anglian Regiment at Radfan Camp and the 1st Bn The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers in the Crater district. All ships company awarded GSM 1962 with clasp South Arabia. Ship departed to Persian Gulf late Feb/early March 1967 returning to Aden for the last time in early June 1967 at outset of Middle East War.

In 1969 &quot;Ashanti&quot; embarked a Royal Marines Commando detachment at Bermuda during a Black Power Conference.

In 1970, &quot;Ashanti&quot; deployed on Beira Patrol, which was designed to prevent oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. The following year &quot;Ashanti&quot; was present at the Royal Navy&#x27;s withdrawal from Malta. In 1974, while returning to Britain from the Caribbean, &quot;Ashanti&quot; suffered two fatalities when a large wave struck the frigate. The ship was just four hours out of Bermuda on her way back to the UK when hit by the wave. One was lost at sea, while the other suffered injuries and died aboard the frigate. The ship returned to Bermuda to disembark the body, and for repairs to the upper deck structure. Premature reports by Bermudian radio stations sent invalid signals to UK and it was reported on national TV news channels that &quot;Ashanti&quot; had been sunk and lost at sea.

Three sailors, Timothy J Burton, David Little and James Wardle, died in 1977 from carbon monoxide poisoning after a fire broke out in a boiler room.

&quot;Ashanti&quot; was returned to service in 1978 following a repair and refit, and finally placed in reserve and became a Harbour Training Ship. She was sunk as a target in 1988 by the submarines and .

The submarine HMS Swiftsure was submerged and launched two Sub Harpoon missiles from distance, video footage was taken from a helicopter observing the exercise. Another &#x27;S&#x27; Class boat situated between HMS Swiftsure and the target hit the ship with Mk24 torpedoes subsequent to the Sub Harpoons, which broke the back of the ship causing it to break in two and sink.

==Experience==
After graduating from the University of New Hampshire in 1974, Morin worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the laboratory now known as the Media Lab. Morin matriculated at New York University School of Medicine in 1974, received a Master of Science in Biochemistry in 1978, an M.D. in 1981, and a Ph.D. in Microbiology in 1982. He then completed two years of residency training in General Surgery at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center and at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, New York City.

In 1982, Morin received a Direct Commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve. In 1983, he entered active duty and attended the Naval Undersea Medical Institute in Groton, Connecticut. He was designated as an Undersea Medical Officer in 1983. He joined the crew of the submarine at the Electric Boat Company Shipyards in Groton. He remained aboard as Medical Officer for both Blue and Gold crews until 1985 when the ship arrived at its home port in Bangor, Washington. During his tour aboard &quot;Henry M. Jackson&quot;, Morin qualified as a Diving Medical Officer, and also received his &quot;Dolphins&quot; as a qualified Submarine Medical Officer.

Morin then entered Flight Surgeon training at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI) in Pensacola, Florida. He received his &quot;Wings of Gold&quot; as a Naval Flight Surgeon in 1986, and remained on the staff at NAMI as Flight Surgeon/Diving Medal Officer until 1989. While at NAMI, he received his Masters of Public Health degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He then left active duty and entered private practice in occupational medicine in Jacksonville, Florida. He remained in the Naval Reserve, and drilled with the United States Marine Corps&#x27; 3rd Force Reconnaissance Company in Mobile, Alabama.

In August 1990, he was recalled to active duty during Operation Desert Shield, when he was assigned to Branch Clinic, Naval Air Station Pensacola as a Flight Surgeon. Morin volunteered to reenter active duty, and was assigned to Administrative Support Unit, Bahrain, as Diving Medical Officer/Flight Surgeon during Operation Desert Storm and during the post-war build-down period.

In 1992, Morin rejoined the staff at NAMI, initially as Special Projects Officer. He was named the Director of Warfare Specialty Programs when NAMI became Naval Aerospace and Operational Medical Institute (NAOMI). In 1995, Morin entered the Residency in Aerospace Medicine at the Naval Aerospace and Operational Medical Institute. He completed the residency in 1996.

==NASA==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Morin reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch, followed by the Astronaut Office Advanced Vehicles Branch. He served a one-year tour with the U.S. State Department, where he was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, Space, and Science. He is currently assigned to the Exploration Branch of the Astronaut Office. He is leading the rapid prototyping of the cockpit for the new Orion spacecraft, and is deputy lead of the Orion Cockpit Working Group. Morin served on the EVA crew of STS-110 (2002) and has logged over 259 hours in space, including over 14 EVA hours.

As of December 2016, Morin was assigned to the Exploration Branch, where he works on the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle.

As of 2021, Morin is a management astronaut which mean he is no longer eligible for flight assignment.

==Space flight experience==
STS-110 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (April 8–19, 2002) was the 13th Space Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station. Mission milestones included: the delivery and installation of the SO (S-Zero) Truss; the first time the station&#x27;s robotic arm was used to maneuver spacewalkers around the station; and the first time that all of a shuttle crew&#x27;s spacewalks were based from the station&#x27;s Quest Airlock. Morin performed 2 EVAs totaling 14 hours and 9 minutes. The crew prepared the station for future spacewalks and spent a week in joint operations with the station&#x27;s Expedition 4 crew. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours and 42 minutes.

<text>The Hastings mine explosion was a fire at the Victor-American Fuel Company coal mine in Hastings, Las Animas County, Colorado, on April 27, 1917, in which 121 people died. A small monument marks the location, on County Road 44, about 1.5 km west of the Ludlow Monument, which commemorates those who died in a massacre during the Colorado Coalfield War. In June 1912, twelve miners were killed in an explosion at the same mine.

==Cause==
A coroner&#x27;s jury found that Hastings mine inspector David Reese caused the explosion when, deep in the mine, he opened his oil-burning, key-lock safety lamp (which generated light by burning the oil on a wick) to attempt to re-light it. Reese&#x27;s body was found with matches in his pants pocket, a violation of mine-safety laws.

<doc id="622353" wikidata="Q7959850" url="?curid=622353" title="Wahta Mohawks">
<text>The Wahta Mohawks () are a Mohawk First Nation in Ontario. The Wahta Mohawk Territory () is their territory (reserve) in the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada near Bala. It is bounded on the west by Highway 400, a major north–south artery in the province. About one-third of the 831 citizens of Wahta Mohawk Territory live in the community of Wahta, along District Road 38, another third live within 100 km, and the remainder live elsewhere.

The land is made up of forest and lakes typical of the rugged Canadian Shield. It is used primarily for hunting and fishing by Mohawk from the reserves of Kanesatake and Kahnewake Quebec, who share access to this territory. It was the site of the now-defunct Iroquois Cranberry Growers, which was Ontario&#x27;s largest cranberry farm. The farm was shut down in 2017 due to economic reasons. &quot;Wáhta&quot; is the Mohawk term for the Maple festival, one of their important ceremonies.

Wahta Mohawk Territory was founded in 1881 after the Sulpician Order bought land here for Mohawk from the community of Kanesatake, Quebec, where there had been political and religious strife over land use rights. About one-fifth of the Mohawk from that community moved to the new area.

They also share the [[Indian River (reserve)|Indian River]] Indian Reserve with the Chippewas of Rama First Nation.

In October 2023, in conjunction with Muskoka District council and the province, District Road 38, which had been formerly known only by its district road number and had no official name apart from that, was given the new name Kanien’kehá:ka Iohatátie, meaning &quot;Mohawk Peoples Road&quot; in the Mohawk language.

==&quot;Wahta Gap&quot;==
For a number of years a Mohawk land claim dispute with the provincial government prevented completion of Highway 400 through Wahta. Consequently, through the late 1990s and early 2000s there was an eight-kilometre gap in the freeway, where the roadway remained a two-lane highway for several years even after construction of the freeway was completed further north; although an agreement in principle was reached between the provincial government and the band council by 2001, construction was further delayed by the inability to reach quorum in a band referendum on the agreement: although two separate votes in 2002 were both solidly in favour of the agreement, neither was legally implementable because overall voter participation fell short of the required minimum of 198 voters both times.

In 2003 the government and the Mohawk First Nation reached an agreement allowing freeway construction through the reserve lands. Begun in 2004, construction was completed in 2008.

==Demographics==
As of March, 2018:
*Population: 156
*Area (km2.): 61.17
*Density (persons per km2.): 2.55

Out of the total 831 Wahta Mohawks, 675 live off-reserve.

<text>Boris Vladimirovich Morukov (; 1 October 1950 – 1 January 2015) was a Russian physician at the State Research Center RF-Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP). He trained with the Russian Federal Space Agency as a research-cosmonaut and flew aboard NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-106 as a mission specialist.

==Biography==
Morukov graduated from high school in 1967 and received his M.D. from the 2nd Moscow Medical Institute (now Russian State Medical University) in 1973. He joined the professorate in space, aviation and naval medicine at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in 1978 and received a Ph.D in these disciplines in 1979. As a cosmonaut-physician, Morukov completed medical training in cardiology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, stomatology, ophthalmology, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation between 1989 and 1991. In 1995, he took an advanced course in emergency medical care. In 1996, he completed a medical training course in endocrinology and hematology. 

From October 1990 to February 1992, Morukov attended a basic space-training course at Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. For more than two decades he was involved in providing medical operations support for crewed space flights. From 1979 to 1980 he provided medical support for the prolonged space missions on the space station &quot;Salyut 6&quot; as a member of the staff in Mission Control Center. From 1982 to 1987, Morukov coordinated scientific projects dedicated to the development of countermeasures to the negative metabolic changes that occur during hypokinesia and microgravity. His specific scientific interest in this area is calcium metabolism correction. He organized a series of experiments with prolonged head-down tilt, including a 370-day experiment dedicated to the experimental testing of a countermeasure complex for prolonged space flights. He participated in a joint American-Russian medical experiment on STS-60, Mir 18/STS-71 and all other Mir-NASA Project Missions. From 1995 to 1998 he served as the Human Life-Sciences Experiments Coordinator for the NASA-Mir scientific program. He published more than 100 scientific papers and has patents for four inventions. 

==Spaceflight experience==

Morukov was first selected for medical-cosmonaut service in 1976. Based on his qualifications, he was continually offered medical-cosmonaut selection and was chosen as a cosmonaut-researcher in 1989. Upon completion of his basic cosmonaut-training in 1992, he became a cosmonaut-researcher in the Institute for Biomedical Problems. From January to July 1993, Morukov completed a technical, medical and scientific training course as a cosmonaut-researcher of the cosmonaut-physician flight on-board Mir Station Project (during Mir 15-17 Missions). From November 1997 to February 1998, he completed a regularly scheduled technical training course, which included ISS Russian-segment systems. From August 1998 to January 1999, Morukov attended the Flight-Surgeon Training Course at Johnson Space Center.

Morukov served on the crew of STS-106 (8–20, 2000). The STS-106 crew successfully prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, a toilet and a treadmill on the Space Station. Two crew members performed a space walk in order to connect power, data and communications cables to the newly arrived Zvezda Service Module and the Space Station. Morukov logged 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes in space.

==Death==
Morukov died on 1 January 2015, aged 64, from undisclosed causes. He is survived by his wife, Nina, son Ivan, daughter Olga, and mother, Lidia F. Khromova.

<text>The Eastern Hockey League was a minor professional United States ice hockey league.

==Eastern Amateur Hockey League (1933–1953)==
The league was founded in 1933 as the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). The league was founded by Tommy Lockhart, who served as its commissioner from 1937 to 1972. Lockhart, who operated a small intramural hockey league at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, offered his teams – and the use of the MSG ice – in exchange for joining the league.

The EAHL operated between 1933–1948 and 1949–1953. The league had a somewhat tenuous existence. It began with seven teams, and had various numbers of teams, going as low as four. There was no 1948–49 season, but the league returned for the 1949–50 season with eight teams. The league again did not operate during the 1953–54 season.

<text>The Archipelago is a township in central Ontario, Canada, along the Georgian Bay in the Parry Sound District.

The municipality consists of two non-contiguous parts, separated by Carling and the Parry Sound. The northern part includes the village of Pointe au Baril on the mainland and most of the geographic townships of Shawanaga and Harrison. This covers the islands and shoreline of Georgian Bay from the Twin Sisters (at the northern boundary of Carling Township) north to Charles Inlet and the Naiscoot River, a few miles south of Britt. The southern part consists of the geographic townships of Cowper and Conger that includes the islands and shoreline of Georgian Bay southwest of Parry Sound, from Twelve Mile Bay (at the District of Muskoka boundary) to Wasauksing First Nation and up the South Channel almost to the town of Parry Sound. Almost a third of the population of the southern part lives on the islands in the Sans Souci and Copperhead area, centred on Frying Pan Island.

The township is characterized by numerous islands (hence its name) and bays that attract large numbers of vacationers and boaters in the summer. Much of its area is undeveloped and crown-owned land: in the north, 96 percent of the mainland and 50 percent of the islands remain in the public domain, and in the south, 83 percent of the mainland and 70 percent of the islands, a large part of it protected in The Massasauga Provincial Park.

==History==
On January 1, 1980, the townships of Georgian Bay South Archipelago and Georgian Bay North Archipelago were formed out of unincorporated geographic townships from the Parry Sound District, primarily in order to provide proper planning in the islands and waterways of the area. These two townships were intended to be set up as one municipality, but the Ontario Legislature created two townships, with a provision for their later amalgamation, if requested by the elected Councils. Soon after the formation of the townships, both councils passed identical by-laws calling for the amalgamation of the two municipalities. Therefore, the Township of the Archipelago was formed on April 1, 1980, when the townships of Georgian Bay South Archipelago and Georgian Bay North Archipelago merged.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, The Archipelago had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
*Mother tongue:
** English as first language: 90.4%
** French as first language: 0%
** English and French as first language: 0%
** Other as first language: 8.6%

==Education==
The community is within the Near North District School Board.

As of 1975, Moon Island, within The Archipelago, was served by the Sugar Bay School. That year, it was one of 21 one-room schools in the province, and there were 12 students in grades 1-8 with ages ranging from 6 to 13. At the time, the closest high school to Moon Island was in Parry Sound, away from Moon Island. Moon Island residents who attended high school lived with relatives living in Parry Sound or stayed at boarding houses during the school year.

<text>Isaac Kristofer Brock (born July 9, 1975) is an American musician and singer-songwriter. He is the lead vocalist, principal songwriter, guitarist and only constant member of the indie rock band Modest Mouse, as well as his side project band, Ugly Casanova. 

As a songwriter, Brock is noted for his wordplay and frequent use of metaphors, philosophical lyrics, themes of authentic rural lifestyles, and phrases and sayings commonly used in the early to mid-20th century and in blue collar environments. Brock is the sole founding member of Modest Mouse still with the band and the only member to appear on all of its studio albums.

==Early life==
Brock was born in Helena, Montana. During his childhood, he lived with his mother and sister in Montana and Oregon in hippie communes and churches before moving to Issaquah, Washington when he was 11 years old. Brock was home-schooled in his early education. When his mother&#x27;s house flooded three times, she was forced to move into her future husband&#x27;s trailer. Brock asked to stay behind in his own room until the new home was completed. He lived in the flooded home until the house was sold. After a short period of living in a friend&#x27;s basement, he moved into the &quot;Shed&quot; built on the land next to his mother and stepfather&#x27;s trailer.

As a young boy he was raised in a Christian religious sect called the Grace Gospel Church. He told an interviewer from &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he was asked to speak in tongues when he was six: &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel the spirit of the fucking Lord rushing through me,&quot; he says. &quot;I definitely felt awkward. I thought. &#x27;What&#x27;s the best way to make this stop?&#x27; So I ripped off some words from Mary Poppins and said them fast, and the deacons are going, &#x27;Yeah, all right!&#x27;&quot;

In 1992, when he was sixteen, Brock moved to Washington, D.C. for the summer where he met his girlfriend. Brock traveled back and forth from the East Coast to Issaquah in Washington State where he took a community-college course to get his high school diploma before moving back to D.C., to New York&#x27;s East Village, and then the Seattle area. It was there that he, Eric Judy (bass) and Jeremiah Green (drums) first started practicing music together in the Shed.

In 2023, Brock was a guest singer and musician on the song &quot;We Got to Move&quot; for the album &quot;Los Angeles&quot; by Lol Tolhurst, Budgie, and Jacknife Lee.

==Personal life==

Although many of his songs use religious themes, Brock describes himself as &quot;not really religious at all&quot;, adding &quot;I&#x27;m 100 percent on the whole Christianity thing being a crock of shit, pretty much.&quot; He claims to &quot;toy around with the whole Biblical thing,&quot; because it &quot;just has amazing characters&quot; and also identifies himself as &quot;pretty much&quot; an atheist.

He has talked about the DUIs he has gotten and cutting himself onstage with a pocket knife. His songs have also addressed his substance abuse, as in &quot;The Good Times Are Killing Me&quot;. Brock admits to past drug use, and now says that drugs are &quot;just something I kind of have to fight... I just try and make sure that it&#x27;s not around, or I&#x27;m not around it.&quot; In a 2003 interview with Salut Les Copains Magazine, Brock explained how the decision to quit drugs was influenced by his experiences. &quot;...I was laying down in this aisle, at Powell&#x27;s Books, reading an atlas when this meth-head tripped over me.&quot; Isaac said, &quot;He called me a faggot and mumbled as he wandered off. I saw a reflection of myself and didn&#x27;t want to be seen like that.&quot;

In 2004 his adopted brother Ansel Vizcaya was killed in an avalanche climbing Mount Rainier.

Brock is a former member of the A&amp;R team for the record label Sub Pop; his most notable accomplishment with them was signing Wolf Parade in 2004.

Brock resides in Portland, Oregon in a house with many taxidermied animals. A portrait of Brock wearing lederhosen and standing in front of a giant boar hung for many years in the office of Portland mayor Sam Adams. He made a cameo appearance in season two of the sketch comedy show &quot;Portlandia&quot;. His character was shown donating records to a pre-school library.

After having signed Lisa Molinaro to his Glacial Pace label in 2010, with her band Talkdemonic, the pair soon entered into a relationship. Molinaro joined Modest Mouse as a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist in 2011. They broke up in 2017.

Brock has three children. His first was born February 2, 2002. According to High Times magazine published November 2018, he also has a daughter, born some time in 2018. In another interview with a radio station 102.1 “The Edge”, it was revealed Brock had another daughter born sometime in 2020 or 2021.

==Equipment==
Brock&#x27;s main guitars are custom made by Wicks Guitars. Prior to his customs, Brock mainly used a Westone Corsair XA1420. He is also known to use various other guitars made by companies such as Peavey, Fender, and Gibson. His amps are custom made by Soursound, based on a Fender SuperSix, but are highly modified.

==Glacial Pace==
In October 2005, Brock started his own record label called Glacial Pace. The label used to be a subsidiary of Epic Records, but is now independent. Its first signee was Minnesota songwriter Mason Jennings, followed by Love As Laughter, Marcellus Hall, Mimicking Birds, Morning Teleportation, Talkdemonic, Survival Knife, Nocturnal Habits, and Mattress.

<text>Sovereign Seven is a creator-owned American comic book series, created by Chris Claremont and Dwayne Turner, and published by DC Comics.

==Publication history==
Launched in April 1995, &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dwayne Turner, and was Claremont&#x27;s first professional regular series work since his departure from Marvel Comics and the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise in 1991. It was the first creator-owned title set in the DC Universe. 

The title met with middling success and was cancelled after 36 issues (three years), in June 1998, after which Claremont returned to Marvel.

==Fictional team history==
The Sovereign Seven are a group of seven members of royal families from planets that were destroyed by a Rapture. Each was saved by the leader of the team - Cascade. The original group consists of Cascade, Finale, Rampart, Reflex, Indigo, Network and Cruiser. Rampart is killed and replaced by the DC character Power Girl in #31.

For a time, the group operates out of a mysterious coffee house (the &quot;Crossroads Coffee Bar&quot;) which is larger on the inside than it is on the outside. Time portals open inside doorways to areas unfamiliar or well-known to the Sovereigns, who work as employees to earn their keep. The coffee house is run by supporting characters Violet Smith and Pansy Jones, comic-book counterparts of the musical alter-egos of Emma Bull and Lorraine Garland—The Flash Girls—of whom Claremont is a fan.

The Sovereign Seven battle villains including Darkseid, Maitresse, and the Female Furies.

==Membership==
* Cascade (Rhian Douglas) is the leader of the Sovereign Seven and has the ability to cascade, or teleport, both herself and others. Her ability generally requires some knowledge of the destination or that she be provided with a &quot;waypoint&quot; by Network. Cascade fled her mother, Maitresse, who ruled Cascade&#x27;s homeworld with unyielding omnipotence.
* Network (Taryn Haldane) is the first of the Sovereigns to meet Cascade, and is the motivating force behind gathering them. Network&#x27;s homeworld is never detailed. She is a telepath, and never hesitates to draw the information she needs from the minds of those around her. It has been shown that when no other people are within range of her powers, or when her powers are suppressed, she is fully illiterate and aphasic, unable to read, speak, or understand any language. It is hinted in several storylines that Network would eventually become a terrorist for captured or controlled telepaths.
* Finale (Pahe Leilani Favaela) is a warrior from a society reminiscent of pre-American Hawaii. She is said to have come from a water world. She makes several references to Mother Ocean and The Great Orca. To defend her world from the Rapture, Finale was forced to kill her world and its inhabitants. As a result, Finale fears water since joining the Sovereigns. She fears what will happen if the Mother Ocean of Earth finds out who she is. Finale wears full body armor throughout the series, and we never truly see her face.
* Rampart (Jaffar Ibn Haroun Al Raschid) is a prince of a Muslim-like society. He has the ability to manifest force fields. He is generally considered to be attractive, as the local girls tend to swoon in his presence.
* Reflex (Walter Thorsson) is a speedster from a seemingly Nordic/Christian heritage. Unlike most characters with super-speed, both in DC and Marvel comics, Reflex is a large person. This causes some problems for him when dealing with normal, everyday things like typing. He does have, as his name suggests, well-honed reflexes.
* Cruiser (Nicholas Helicon) is a telekinetic who fuels his powers with his body mass. As a result, he&#x27;s always hungry. Throughout the series, Cruiser goes from incredibly skinny and &#x27;running on empty&#x27;, to quite fat, but with plenty of power in reserve.
* Indigo is one of the most mysterious of the Sovereign Seven. &#x27;He&#x27; is an enigma, without a true identity; even the pronoun &quot;he&quot; is arbitrary. When he desires it, Indigo can go completely unnoticed. His presence simply is not registered, whether it&#x27;s in a dark hallway or a crowded street. He is also the consummate persuader. He can convince almost anyone (or anything) to do what he wants. He is a master infiltrator, able to get into and out of secure areas. He is also the Sovereigns&#x27; tactician, carrying out Cascade&#x27;s orders no matter how difficult.

<doc id="622383" wikidata="Q133326" url="?curid=622383" title="Barbus">
<text>Barbus is a genus of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae. The type species of &quot;Barbus&quot; is the common barbel, first described as &quot;Cyprinus barbus&quot; and now named &quot;Barbus barbus&quot;. &quot;Barbus&quot; is the namesake genus of the subfamily Barbinae, but given their relationships, that taxon is better included in the Cyprininae at least for the largest part (including the type species of &quot;Barbus&quot;).

==Description and uses==
Their common names – barbs and barbels – refer to the fact that most members of the genera have a pair of barbels on their mouths, which they can use to search for food at the bottom of the water.

Barbels are often fished for food; in some locations they are of commercial significance. The roe of barbels is poisonous, however. The large &quot;Barbus&quot; barbs are also often eaten in their native range.

The smaller barbs are in some cases traded as aquarium fish. Some are quite significant, but as a whole, the genus is not yet as well represented in aquaria as the Southeast Asian &quot;Puntius&quot;.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
&quot;Barbus&quot; has a long history as a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. Historically, most fish commonly known as &quot;barbs&quot; were usually placed here by default. More recently, many &quot;barbs&quot; have been reclassified into genera such as &quot;Arabibarbus&quot;, &quot;Barbichthys&quot;, &quot;Barbodes&quot;, &quot;Barboides&quot;, &quot;Barbonymus&quot;, &quot;Barbopsis&quot;, &quot;Caecobarbus&quot;, &quot;Capoeta&quot;, &quot;Carasobarbus&quot;, &quot;Clypeobarbus&quot;, &quot;Enteromius&quot;, &quot;Hypselobarbus&quot;, &quot;Hypsibarbus&quot;, &quot;Labeobarbus&quot;, &quot;Leptobarbus&quot;, &quot;Luciobarbus&quot;, &quot;Mesopotamichthys&quot;, &quot;Poropuntius&quot;, &quot;Probarbus&quot;, &quot;Pseudobarbus&quot;, &quot;Puntioplites&quot; and &quot;Puntius&quot;.

Thus, &quot;Barbus&quot; is for the time being restricted to typical barbels, and only contains fishes from Africa and Europe, as well as adjacent Asia. However, the genus even in the reduced version is probably paraphyletic, and many African species (particularly the small ones) do not seem to belong here, either. Eventually, &quot;Barbus&quot; is likely to be restricted to the group around &quot;B. barbus&quot; – the large European to Ponto-Caspian species commonly known as &quot;barbels&quot;. &quot;Luciobarbus&quot; and particularly &quot;Messinobarbus&quot; are highly similar and might better be included in &quot;Barbus&quot; again. They all seem to be close relatives – perhaps the closest living relatives – of &quot;Aulopyge huegelii&quot;. &quot;Carasobarbus&quot; and &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; are probably closely related to this group, too, and some large hexaploid barbs (e.g. &quot;L. reinii&quot;) may well belong in &quot;Labeobarbus&quot;.

The small barbs from Africa, by contrast, are quite distinct. They might even warrant establishment of a new subfamily – in particular if the Labeoninae are not included in the Cyprininae –, as they seem to be as distinct from barbels and typical carps, as these are from the garras (which are part of the disputed Labeoninae), rendering the old &quot;Barbinae&quot; paraphyletic. Within the small African barbs, several lineages can be recognized. These are mostly diploid; a tetraploid group largely restricted to southern Africa is very close to &quot;Pseudobarbus&quot; and might even be included therein. In particular, the group called &quot;redfins&quot; may well be monophyletic and belong in &quot;Pseudobarbus&quot; entirely, instead of being split between &quot;Pseudobarbus&quot; and &quot;Barbus&quot;.

==Species==
These are the currently recognized species of this genus:

* &quot;Barbus anatolicus&quot;

* &quot;Barbus rebeli&quot; (Western Balkan barbel)
* &quot;Barbus rionicus&quot; 
* &quot;Barbus samniticus&quot; 
* &quot;Barbus sperchiensis&quot; (Sperchios barbel)
* &quot;Barbus strumicae&quot; (Strumica barbel)
* &quot;Barbus tauricus&quot; (Crimean barbel)
* &quot;Barbus thessalus&quot; (Thessalian barbel)
* &quot;Barbus tyberinus&quot; (Horse barbel)
* &quot;Barbus waleckii&quot; (Vistula barbel)
* &quot;Barbus xanthos&quot; 

=== Fossil species ===
A fossil species (&quot;Barbus megacephalus&quot; ) is known from the Paleogene Sipang Fauna of Indonesia., but it probably should be placed in another genus.

<text>Kent Ronald Hance (born November 14, 1942) is an American politician and lawyer who is the former Chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. In his role, he oversaw Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas. He is also a lobbyist and lawyer. Hance is the only person to defeat future President George W. Bush (which he did in the 1978 U.S. House of Representatives election for Texas&#x27;s 19th District) and became a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from West Texas, having served from 1979 to 1985. After his congressional service, he switched to the Republican Party and in both 1986 and 1990 ran for governor of Texas, losing in the primary election.

==Early years and election to Congress==
Hance obtained his Bachelor of Business Administration degree in finance from the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University in 1965 where he was also a member of Delta Tau Delta, which he served as president. He also served as the Student Government Association Vice-president and was a member of the Saddle Tramps.

He later attended the University of Texas School of Law. During his time as a law student, he was the Student Bar Association President and chosen as recipient of the Counsel Award. After law school, he was admitted to the Texas bar and in 1968 became a practicing attorney in Lubbock, Texas. During this period, he was also a law professor at Texas Tech from 1968 until 1973.

In 1974, Hance ran for the Texas Senate and defeated incumbent H.J. &quot;Doc&quot; Blanchard in the 1974 primary. His campaign at the beginning seemed doomed to failure, but Hance quickly made connection with voters in the sprawling West Texas district.

=== 1978 election vs. George W. Bush ===
He served in the state senate from 1975 to 1979. After winning the 1978 Democratic primary nomination for the Lubbock-based 19th Congressional District, he defeated the Republican nominee George W. Bush of Midland. The seat, which was based in Lubbock, had been held since inception by popular Democrat George H. Mahon, long-time chairman of the House Appropriations Committee (the 19th included most of the Permian Basin at the time). Bush won the Republican nomination in a hard-fought but low-turnout runoff primary against the 1976 party nominee, Jim Reese of Odessa.

The 19th had long been one of the more conservative areas of Texas. It was one of the first areas of Texas to move away from its Democratic roots; it hadn&#x27;t supported a Democrat for president since 1964. However, at the time, conservative Democrats continued to represent much of the region at the state and local levels, and would do so well into the 1990s. Hance claimed Bush was &quot;not a real Texan&quot; because of his privileged upbringing and Yale education. Hance won by seven points—the only time that the future 43rd President of the United States was ever defeated in an election.

=== Tenure in Congress ===
As a Democratic member of Congress during 1979–1985, Hance was a member of the &quot;boll-weevil&quot; conservative Democrats. As such, he became one of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s allies and carried his tax-cut, the nation&#x27;s largest tax cut, in 1981.

Hance was reelected two times. His voting record was very conservative even by Texas Democrat standards; he compiled a lifetime rating of 72 from the American Conservative Union.

=== Run for Senate ===
He did not run for a fourth term in 1984, opting instead to seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring John Tower. Hance announced within hours of Tower&#x27;s withdrawal that he would run for the Senate. No candidate received a majority vote in the primary, so Hance, along with State Senator Lloyd Doggett of Austin, advanced to a run-off. He was defeated by only 1,345 votes by Doggett, who lost the general election for Senate but later served many years in the House.

Hance endorsed one of his aides, Don R. Richards, in the Democratic primary for his congressional seat. Richards won the nomination, but was defeated in the general election by a young Republican, Larry Combest, a former aide to Tower. Proving just how Republican this district had become at the national level, Richards only tallied 41.9 percent of the vote—one of only two times since Hance left office that a Democrat has cleared 40 percent of the vote.

Hance donated money to his former opponent George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign for Governor of Texas in 1994.

==Kent R. Hance Chapel==
On May 1, 2011, Texas Tech University announced that Kent Hance provided the largest gift, $1.75 million, toward the $3 million privately funded non-denominational campus chapel, named the Kent R. Hance Chapel designed by McKinney York Architects.

==Awards==
In 1985, Hance received the Texas Tech Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni Award. 
In 2009, Hance received the South Plains Council Boy Scouts of America John F. Lott Distinguished Citizen Award.
In 2009–2010, Hance received the Outstanding Texas State Leader Award at the Annual Texas Leadership Forum, presented by the John Ben Shepperd Public Leadership Institute. Additionally, Hance received the Hope Award from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society West Texas Chapter in April 2010.

He got his start at Marvel Comics on such titles as &quot;Avengers Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot;. For DC, he penciled the &quot;Power of the Atom&quot; limited series in 1988. Teaming up with writer Marcus McLaurin and inker Chris Ivy, Turner penciled the bulk of the first 12 issues of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Cage&quot; title in 1992–1993. In 1995, he co-created the title &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; for DC Comics with writer Chris Claremont.

In 1992, he co-created the character James Lucas for Marvel Comics with writer Marcus McLaurin. In 1993, he co-created Hulk 2099 for Marvel Comics with writer Gerard Jones. In 2001 he co-created the character Orpheus also for DC Comics with writer Alex Simmons. In 2003, he co-created the character Traci Thirteen for DC Comics with writer Joe Kelly.

Turner worked on a number of Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot; titles, with a long run on the spin-off series &quot;Curse of the Spawn&quot; from 1996 to 1999. He was the penciller on volume 2 of Wildstorm&#x27;s &quot;The Authority&quot; in 2003–2004.

Leaving the comics industry in 2006, Turner has worked in the video game and motion picture fields. As a storyboard illustrator, his feature film credits include &quot;&quot;, &quot;Oblivion&quot;, and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. His video game work includes the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, the &quot;God of War&quot; franchise, and &quot;Gears of War&quot;.

<text>Australia Post, formally the Australian Postal Corporation and also known as AusPost, is an Australian Government-owned corporation that provides postal services throughout Australia. Australia Post&#x27;s head office is located on Swan Street in Richmond Victoria.

Australia Post is the successor of the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department, which was established at federation in 1901 to formalise colonial postal services. In 1975, the department was abolished and its postal functions were taken over by the Australian Postal Commission. The organisation&#x27;s current name and structure were adopted in 1989 when it was made into a government-owned corporation.

== History ==
=== Colonial Australia (pre–1901) ===

Before colonial control of mail started in 1809, mail was usually passed on by ad hoc arrangements made between transporters, storekeepers and settlers. These arrangements were flexible, and inherently unstable. It was common for early settlers to ride many miles out of their way to deliver neighbours&#x27; mail that had been collected from informal distribution points.

The first organisation of a postal service in Australia commenced in 1809 with the appointment in Sydney of the first postmaster. An English ex-convict, Isaac Nichols, took the post operating from his home in George Street, Sydney. His main job was to take charge of letters and parcels arriving by ship, to avoid the chaos of people rushing aboard ships as soon as they arrived at Sydney&#x27;s wharves. Nichols would pick up the mail and post a list of recipients outside his house. He would advertise in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; the names of all those who received mail. Recipients paid a fixed price of one shilling per letter to collect mail from Nichols&#x27; home, with parcels costing more depending on how heavy they were. VIP addressees were afforded personal delivery by Nichols.

Between 1812 and 1842, postmasters were also appointed in Tasmania (1812), Western Australia (1829), Victoria (1836), South Australia (1837) and Queensland (1842). Settlements outside of the postmasters&#x27; domain were serviced by contractors on horsebacks or in coaches.

In 1825, the New South Wales Legislative Council passed the &quot;Postal Act&quot; which transferred responsibility from Nichols, acting as a private company, to the governor. The governor would then set the wage of the postmaster and the cost of collecting mail.

=== 20th century ===
Following federation in 1901, the colonial mail systems were merged into the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department (PMG). This body was responsible for telegraph and domestic telephone operations as well as postal mail. An airmail service was introduced in 1914. In 1967, 4-digit postcodes in Australia were introduced, in addition to the world&#x27;s first mechanical processing centre, which garnered international attention.

On 1 July 1975, separate government commissions were created to undertake the operational responsibilities of the PMG. One of these was the Australian Postal Commission. It later became the Australian Postal Corporation on 1 January 1989 when it was corporatised into what is now known as the Australian Postal Corporation, or Australia Post.

In December 1987, 21-year-old Melbourne University student Frank Vitkovic, while experiencing a mental health crisis, entered the Australian Post building located at 191 Queen Street in Melbourne and spoke &quot;animatedly&quot; with an unidentified friend who worked in the building, then perpetrated what came to be known as the Queen Street massacre. The mass shooting left eight Australia Post and other company employees dead. The perpetrator fell to his death from the building while struggling with a security guard. The incident resulted in calls to strengthen gun control laws in Australia.

=== 21st century ===
Under amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act which came into effect in March 2008, quarantine inspection officers of a state or territory are authorised to request Australia Post to open packets and parcels sent from interstate for inspection when inspectors believe they may contain quarantine material. The legislation also authorises Australia Post to remove any mail articles that are suspected of being scam mail.

In February 2010, Ahmed Fahour was appointed MD (CEO) of Australia Post. In May 2010, he announced a new strategy dubbed &quot;Future Ready&quot; designed to reinvigorate Australia Post. This included a new organisation structure as well as a renewed foray into digital businesses under the &quot;eServices&quot; strategic business unit.

However, in 2013, the corporation acknowledged that, though the strategy was successful in improving Australia Post&#x27;s profitability and structure, it was insufficient in its contributions to their development as a financially self-sustaining business.

In September 2015, the corporation announced its first loss in 30 years. The 222 million loss was down from a $116 million profit the previous year. Large decreases in addressed and stamped mail led to a $381 million loss in the mail delivery side of the business. Parcel delivery then accounted for over half of total revenue. Overall revenue was stable at $6.37 billion.

In August the following year, Australia Post returned to profit with strong parcel and courier performance, and organisation re-structuring. However, mail performance reached an all-time low.

In February 2017, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised CEO Ahmed Fahour&#x27;s $5.6 million annual salary, saying &quot;As the Prime Minister and a taxpayer, I&#x27;ve spoken to the chairman today. I think that salary, that remuneration, is too high.&quot; On 23 February 2017, Fahour announced his resignation, effective July 2017, telling media that the decision was not related to discussion of his salary.

In October 2019, Australia Post completed a major rebranding project with Melbourne-based brand strategy firm Maud. This project saw the development of a new brand identity, website and self-service platform, parcel and letter packaging, street posting boxes, staff uniforms, and a fleet of custom-designed electric vehicles, amongst others.

In 2019, with parcels deliveries increasing while letter deliveries falling, the Post Office transferred several thousand workers from letters to parcels. Letter deliveries were reduced from five days per week to two days per week.

In 2021, Australia Post began using its first electric trucks; three Fuso Ecanters in Melbourne.

== Operational development ==

Responding to competitive pressures, Australia Post continued to broaden its product and service range in 2019, having invested in extensive technology-based infrastructure programmes. It operates in three core areas: letters and associated services; retail merchandise and agency services; and parcels and logistics. It has a number of subsidiaries and joint ventures, including Sai Cheng Logistics International—a joint-venture logistics company established with China Post in 2005.

Australia Post operates regular mail delivery as well as an express/courier service through Messenger Post (Now trading as Startrack Courier).

Australia Post is self-funding and uses its assets and resources to generate profits, which can be reinvested in the business or returned as dividends to its sole shareholder, the Australian Government. Under its community service obligations, Australia Post is committed to providing an accessible, affordable and reliable letter service for all Australians wherever they reside. The corporation reaches more than 10 million Australian addresses; operates 4,330 postal outlets; and serves more than a million customers in postal outlets every business day. When the basic domestic letter rate was increased to $1.00 on 4 January 2016, there were no changes to prices of concession stamps or seasonal greeting stamps, which remained at 60 cents and 65 cents respectively. At the same time, a category of &quot;Priority&quot; mail was introduced (as distinct from &quot;Regular&quot;), under which delivery standards were varied and a 50-cent Priority label was required as additional payment for the better standard.

Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, letters up to 250 grams are reserved to Australia Post – other people and businesses can only carry them if they charge four times the basic postage rate. All of the other goods and services provided by Australia Post are sold in fully competitive markets and, in 2005–06, nearly 90 per cent of the corporation&#x27;s profit (from ordinary activities before net interest and tax) came from selling products and services in competitive markets.

==== Job cuts ====
In June 2015, Australia Post announced that in view of mounting losses, and especially the accelerating decline in its letter delivery service, it would reduce its workforce by 1,900 over three years through voluntary redundancies. At the time, mail delivery losses were approaching $500 million for the 2014–15 financial year. As of 2019 however, Australia Post&#x27;s workforce was broadly similar in numbers compared to 2015.

== Facts and statistics ==
Nationwide there are 7,950 postal routes serviced by 10,000 &quot;posties&quot;. Motorcycles (including the Honda CT110) are used for delivery on about 6,600 routes, bicycles on 350 routes and walking for 1,000 routes. Electric-assisted bicycles were introduced in Victoria in 2011. Cars, trucks and vans are used on only the longest routes. Until the 1960s the longest, and the world&#x27;s longest, overland mail route was Meekatharra to Marble Bar, Western Australia. As there were few roads, a round trip took seven days. The current longest overland route is Norseman, Western Australia to Border Village, South Australia: . The longest air service delivers to remote communities in the outback covering over two days. The last remaining mailboat service operates still on the Hawkesbury River to the north of Sydney, out of Brooklyn ― The Riverboat Postman.The most isolated Post Office is located from Onslow, Western Australia, from the nearest customer. The highest Post Office is located in Perisher Ski Resort at 1720m above sea level.

According to the 2019 annual report, Australia Post:
* delivered 40 million parcels in December (a new record);
* generated revenue of $6.99 billion;
* earned profit (before tax) of $41.1 million;
* saved over $250 million (business efficiency savings);
* obtained complete ownership of Australia Post Global (APG);
* domestic parcel growth reached a revenue of up to 9.2%;
* still owns StarTrack;
*delivers to 214 countries.

and had:
* over 4,342 post offices, over 2,529 in rural and remote areas
* over 15,037 street posting boxes
* approximately 80,000 people in the workforce

Undelivered items go to the mail redistribution centres, which attempt to return the items to their senders.

In February 2015, Australia Post reported a 56% fall in its half-year profit from 2014, a loss of A$151m. The first full-year loss in over 30 years was forecast. Managing Director, Ahmed Fahour noted this tied in with a worldwide decline of letter volumes over the past seven years.

In February 2017, it was reported Fahour&#x27;s reforms reduced potential 2015-16 losses, to A$138 million.

== Products and services ==
Australia Post operates in three core markets: letters and associated services; agency services and retail merchandise; and parcels and logistics that span both domestic and international markets.

=== Letters and associated services ===
Australia Post collects, processes and distributes letters for the entire Australian community and between Australia and other countries overseas. It also offers bulk mail delivery services for businesses and community organisations and provides research, advice, consumer list rental, and profiling and segmentation services to help businesses target their objectives and customers, along with other associated services.

==== Postal services ====

While postal services of letters and parcels are one of the original areas of Australia Post, it has also diversified its operations into the provision of other services including agency services, business-to-business integration and logistics and supply chain management (see below).

==== Postage rate ====

===== Basic domestic =====
The basic postage rate for a small letter has increased over the years due to inflation but influenced in recent years by a complex interplay between Australia Post&#x27;s monopoly over small items, and need to provide service to all Australian addresses at the mandated basic rate. For version of this table showing inflation, see List of postage rates in Australia.

In July 2009, Australia Post requested the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) to approve a stamp price rise in 2010 to 60 cents but the ACCC declined the approval of the price rise, however in April 2010, Australia Post resubmitted the proposed postal stamp rise. The ACCC approved this request on 28 May 2010 and it was published in the Government Gazette on 9 June 2010.

On 26 December 2013, due to the heavy decline in mail usage due to competition from email, etc., Australia Post requested an increase in the base rate to 70c.

On 4 January 2016, due to the heavy decline in mail usage due to competition from email, etc., Australia Post requested an increase in the base rate to $1.00.

 the base rate for domestic letters was $1.10.

* 45c – 2000 (effective 1 July 2000. With the introduction of the GST, the postage component was decreased to absorb the new GST cost, so for the public there was no change in stamp prices. For businesses the GST claimable component of the postage rate was 4¢, leaving a reduced cost to business users of just 41¢.

* $1.20 – 2023 (effective 1 January 2023)
* $1.50 – current (effective 3 April 2024)

===== Large letters =====
Since about 2005, larger letters have been charged a round multiple of the base postage rate, which is helpful to customers if they do not have stocks of the more expensive stamps.
* 260 x 360 x 20mm – Up to 125g – $2.40
* 260 x 360 x 20mm – Up to 250g – $3.60
* 260 x 360 x 20mm – Up to 500g – $6.00

A large letter, including packaging, cannot be more than 20mm thick or larger than 260x360mm, otherwise it will be considered a parcel, which as of July 2023 costs a minimum of $10.60 (up to 500 grams).

Australia Post collects, processes and delivers single parcels or multi-parcel consignments all across Australia and internationally. It also provides complete end-to-end supply chain capabilities, from manufacturer (domestic or international) to consumer with integrated logistics services and a broad range of distribution options to track and trace deliveries.

=== Digital services ===
Australia Post offers a number of digital services outside of their main mail/parcel/logistics area. These include employment screening, online payment services and a digital identity platform.

=== Parcel lockers ===
Australia Post started offering parcel lockers in 2012, which has now expanded to over 700 locations near post offices, supermarkets and railway stations. These lockers are free to use for Australia Post deliveries and can be picked up at anytime during day or night. Once delivered, the package must be picked up within 48 hours.

Parcel lockers are also available to use for sending prepaid parcels under 16 kg, with tracking details updated as soon as you have dropped your parcel off.

=== Vending machines ===

Australia Post provides 24/7 vending machines which sells postal items such as satchels, stamps, and envelopes.

=== StarTrack ===
On 23 December 2003, Australia Post and Qantas went into a joint venture to acquire StarTrack from the company&#x27;s founder, Greg Poche.

On 18 May 2011, it was announced the merger of the retail division of Australian airExpress (AaE) with StarTrack. StarTrack will be a solely retail-focused business and AaE will focus solely on domestic air linehaul and cargo terminal operations. The changes follow a review of the businesses guided by AUX Investments, a company established in 2010, to guide the review and provide streamlined governance across the businesses.

In November 2012, Australia Post bought the 50% of the company owned by Qantas. As part of the deal, Australia Post divested itself of its 50% interest in Australian airExpress to Qantas.

On 7 May 2014, StarTrack was rebranded to include Australia Post Post horn in the StarTrack blue colours. StarTrack also took responsibility of Australia Post&#x27;s &quot;Messenger Post couriers&quot; under the StarTrack brand as &quot;StarTrack Courier&quot;.

== Letterboxes ==
Letter boxes for houses and units (condominium) are mostly standard items bought from hardware stores.

Letterboxes for farms and sparsely located rural houses are often made from 44-gallon or smaller barrels. Such boxes were formerly numbered using the Rural Mail Box system, but they are now numbered according to distance travelled on a main road. For example, if your property&#x27;s letter box is located 10.52 kilometres from the start of the main road, your letter box number is 1052. Rural letter boxes are located on the road and not the farm.

== Criticism and controversies ==

Australia Post has had a long and difficult relationship with the Communication Workers Union. In 2012, the union claimed that delivery contractors provided a poor parcel delivery service, especially during the peak Christmas period. Alleged shortcomings included a propensity to insert &quot;delivery failure&quot; cards into mailboxes rather than attempting delivery of packages, thus requiring the customer to travel to a post office to collect items personally.

Complaints by individuals and the LPO Group about Australia Post&#x27;s business practices in relation to its franchised retail outlets – Licensed Post Offices (LPOs) and Community Postal Agencies (CPAs) – resulted in the Australian Senate conducting an inquiry in 2014. The inquiry&#x27;s unanimous report included recommendations for increased payments and the establishment of an independently chaired stakeholder forum.

In May 2015, Australia Post had a legal battle with Sendle, a transnational courier using the slogan &quot;Post without the office&quot;. Australia Post claimed that the term was deceptively similar to their trademark and what they stand for. Sendle argued that there was no similarity and that in fact, they were differentiating from Australia Post. Two years were spent in the trademark dispute, which resulted in Sendle winning the case.

===2020 watch controversy===

On 2 November 2020, the CEO Christine Holgate announced resignation, due to increasing pressure from the Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher to investigate further into the gifting of four senior executives with the total of $20,000 AUD worth of Cartier watches. The watches were initially reported as $3000 each, tallying $12,000 AUD on purchase. Ms Holgate argued that she did not regret the purchase, as its purpose was to &quot;drive positive change&quot; and &quot;&quot;thank and reward positive behaviours&quot;.&quot; Increasing media attention also contributed to her decision, as it was causing much &quot;debate and distraction&quot; and was negatively impacting her health. She retorted, &quot;I appreciate the optics of the gifts involved do not pass the &#x27;pub test&#x27; for many&quot;.

The reward was reportedly to tip the 4 senior executives who secured a deal in 2018, which allowed the customers of Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac to do their banking at the post office.

During Senate Estimates hearing on 22 October 2020, Ms Holgate defended her decision, saying &quot;We are a commercial organisation, it was a recommendation from our chair that these people get rewarded&quot;. Australia Post is owned by the Australian Government, but is commercialised through corporatisation, and does not receive funding from the government.

<doc id="622410" wikidata="Q1289826" url="?curid=622410" title="Solo Avengers">
<text>Solo Avengers was an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics, and was a spin-off from the company&#x27;s superhero team title &quot;The Avengers&quot;. It was published for 20 issues (December 1987–July 1989) until it was renamed Avengers Spotlight with issue #21 (August 1989). The series was cancelled as of issue #40 (January 1991).

The format of the title was usually two stories, one featuring the character Hawkeye and the other a back-up strip showcasing a current or former member of the Avengers. With issue #35, the format changed to exclusively focus on one full-length story.

Artist Amanda Conner&#x27;s first published work in the comics industry was the 11–page Yellowjacket back-up story in &quot;Solo Avengers&quot; #12 (November 1988).

==Solo Avengers==
==Avengers Spotlight==
==Avengers: Solo==
In December 2011, a five-part limited series titled Avengers: Solo was released following the same format as &quot;Solo Avengers&quot;. Once again, the central story, written by Jen Van Meter and illustrated by Roger Robinson, starred Hawkeye with the cast of &quot;Avengers Academy&quot;, by Jim McCann and Clayton Harris, in the back-up story.

==Collected editions==
* &quot;Avengers: Solo Avengers Classic&quot; collects &quot;Solo Avengers&quot; #1–10, 240 pages, February 2012,

<text>Growth hormone therapy refers to the use of growth hormone (GH) as a prescription medication—it is one form of hormone therapy. Growth hormone is a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates growth and cell reproduction. In the past, growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands. Growth hormone is now produced by recombinant DNA technology and is prescribed for a variety of reasons. GH therapy has been a focus of social and ethical controversies for 50 years.

This article describes the history of GH treatment and the current uses and risks arising from GH use. Other articles describe GH physiology, diseases of GH excess (acromegaly and pituitary gigantism), deficiency, the recent phenomenon of HGH controversies, growth hormone in sports, and growth hormone for cows.

==Medical uses==
===HGH deficiency in children===
Growth hormone deficiency is treated by replacing growth hormone.

Lonapegsomatropin was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2021.

===HGH deficiency in adults===
The Endocrine Society has recommended that adult patients diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHd) be administered an individualized GH treatment regimen. With respect to diagnosis, their guidelines state that &quot;adults patients with structural hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery or irradiation in these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies be considered for evaluation for acquired GHd&quot; and that &quot;idiopathic GHd in adults is very rare, and stringent criteria are necessary to make this diagnosis. Because in the absence of suggestive clinical circumstances there is a significant false-positive error rate in the response to a single GH stimulation test, we suggest the use of two tests before making this diagnosis.&quot;

GH replacement therapy can provide a number of measurable benefits to GH-deficient adults. These include improved bone density, increased muscle mass, decrease of adipose tissue, faster hair and nail growth, strengthened immune system, increased circulatory system, and improved blood lipid levels, but long term mortality benefit has not yet been demonstrated.

A peer-reviewed article published in 2010 indicates that &quot;Growth hormone (GH) replacement unequivocally benefits growth, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life. Less is known about the effects of GH on learning and memory.&quot;

===Other===
As of 2004, GH has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of other conditions such as:
* In adults, wasting (or cachexia) caused by AIDS.
* Turner syndrome epitomizes the response of non-deficient shortness. At doses 20% higher than those used in GH deficiency, growth accelerates. With several years of treatment the median gain in adult height is about 5-8 cm on this dose. The gains appear to be dose-dependent. It has been used successfully in toddlers with Turner syndrome, as well as in older girls.
* Short-stature homeobox gene deficiency 
* Chronic kidney failure results in many problems, including growth failure. GH treatment for several years both before and after transplantation may prevent further deceleration of growth and may narrow the height deficit, though even with treatment net adult height loss may be about 10 cm
* Prader–Willi syndrome, a generally non-hereditary genetic condition, is a case where GH is prescribed for benefits in addition to height. GH is one of the treatment options an experienced endocrinologist may use when treating a child with PWS. GH can help children with PWS in height, weight, body mass, strength, and agility. . Reports have indicated increase of growth rate (especially in the first year of treatment) and a variety of other positive effects, including improved body composition (higher muscle mass, lower fat mass); improved weight management; increased energy and physical activity; improved strength, agility, and endurance; and improved respiratory function. The Prader–Willi Syndrome Association (US) recommends that a sleep study be conducted before initiating GH treatment in a child with PWS. At this time there is no direct evidence of a causative link between growth hormone and the respiratory problems seen in PWS (among both those receiving and those not receiving GH treatment), including sudden death. A follow-up sleep study after one year of GH treatment may also be indicated. GH (specifically Pfizer&#x27;s version, Genotropin) is the only treatment that has received an FDA indication for children with PWS. The FDA indication only applies to children.
* Children short because of intrauterine growth retardation are small for gestational age at birth for a variety of reasons. If early catch-up growth does not occur and their heights remain below the third percentile by 2 or 3 years of age, adult height is likely to be similarly low. High-dose GH treatment has been shown to accelerate growth, but data on long term benefits and risks are limited.
* Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is one of the most controversial indications for GH as pediatric endocrinologists do not agree on its definition, diagnostic criteria, or limits. The term has been applied to children with severe unexplained shortness that will result in an adult height below the 3rd percentile. In the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company sponsored trials of their brand of rHGH (Humatrope) in children with extreme ISS, those at least 2.25 standard deviations below mean (in the lowest 1.2 percent of the population). These boys and girls appeared to be headed toward heights of less than 160 cm and 150 cm respectively. They were treated for about four years and gained 4-8 cm in adult height. Controversy has arisen as to whether all of these children were truly &quot;short normal&quot; children, since the average IGF1 was low. Approval of HGH for the treatment of this extreme degree of shortness led to an increase in the number of parents seeking its use to make otherwise normal children a little taller.

==Adverse effects==
&quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published two editorials in 2003 expressing concern about off-label uses of HGH and the proliferation of advertisements for &quot;HGH-Releasing&quot; dietary supplements, and emphasized that there is no evidence that use of HGH in healthy adults or in geriatric patients is safe and effective – and especially emphasized that risks of long-term HGH treatment are unknown. One editorial was by Jeffrey M. Drazen, M.D., the editor-in-chief of the journal; the other one was by Mary Lee Vance, who provided the NEJM&#x27;s editorial original, cautious comment on a much cited 1990 study on the use of HGH in geriatric patients with low growth hormone levels.

A small but controlled study of GH given to severely ill adults in an intensive care unit setting for the purpose of increasing strength and reducing the muscle wasting of critical illness showed a higher mortality rate for the patients having received GH. The reason is unknown, but GH is now rarely used in ICU patients unless they have severe growth hormone deficiency.

GH treatment usually decreases insulin sensitivity, but some studies showed no evidence for increased diabetes incidence in GH-treated adult hypopituitary patients.

In past it was believed that GH treatment could increase the cancer risk; a large study recently concluded that &quot;With relatively short follow-up, the overall primary cancer risk in 6840 patients receiving GH as adults was not increased. Elevated SIRs (which is risk of getting cancer) were found for subgroups in the USA cohort defined by age &lt;35 years or childhood onset GH deficiency.&quot;

The FDA issued a Safety Communication in August 2011, stating that the evidence regarding recombinant human growth hormone and increased risk of death is inconclusive after reviewing sources including a French study which compared persons with certain kinds of short stature (idiopathic growth hormone deficiency and idiopathic or gestational short stature) treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and who were followed over a long period of time, with individuals in the general population of France.

==History==
Perhaps the most famous person who exemplified the appearance of untreated congenital growth hormone deficiency was Charles Sherwood Stratton (1838–1883), who was exhibited by P. T. Barnum as General Tom Thumb, and married Lavinia Warren. Pictures of the couple show the typical adult features of untreated severe growth hormone deficiency. Despite the severe shortness, limbs and trunks are proportional.

By the middle of the twentieth century, endocrinologists understood the clinical features of growth hormone deficiency. GH is a protein hormone, like insulin, which had been purified from pig and cow pancreases for treatment of type 1 diabetes since the 1920s. However, pig and cow GH did not work at all in humans, due to greater species-to-species variation of molecular structure (i.e., insulin is considered more &quot;evolutionarily conserved&quot; than GH).

===Extraction for treatment===

Extracted growth hormone was used since the late 1950s until the late 1980s when its use was replaced by recombinant GH.

In the late 1950s, Maurice Raben purified enough GH from human pituitary glands to successfully treat a GH-deficient boy. A few endocrinologists began to help parents of severely GH-deficient children to make arrangements with local pathologists to collect human pituitary glands after removal at autopsy. Parents would then contract with a biochemist to purify enough growth hormone to treat their child. Few families could manage such a complicated undertaking.

In 1960, the National Pituitary Agency was formed as a branch of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this agency was to supervise the collection of human pituitary glands when autopsies were performed, arrange for large-scale extraction and purification of GH, and distribute it to a limited number of pediatric endocrinologists for treating GH-deficient children under research protocols. Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, France, Israel, and other countries establish similar government-sponsored agencies to collect pituitaries, purify GH, and distribute it for treatment of severely GH-deficient children.

Supplies of this &quot;cadaver growth hormone&quot; were limited, and only the most severely deficient children were treated. From 1963 to 1985 about 7700 children in the U.S. and 27,000 children worldwide were given GH extracted from human pituitary glands to treat severe GH deficiency. Physicians trained in the relatively new specialty of pediatric endocrinology provided most of this care, but in the late 1960s there were only a hundred of these physicians in a few dozen of the largest university medical centers around the world.

In 1977, the NPA GH extraction and purification procedure was refined and improved.

A shortage of available cadaver GH worsened in the late 1970s as the autopsy rate in the U.S. declined, while the number of pediatric endocrinologists able to diagnose and treat GH deficiency increased. GH was &quot;rationed.&quot; Often, treatment would be stopped when a child reached an arbitrary minimal height, such as . Children who were short for reasons other than severe GH deficiency were lied to and told that they would not benefit from treatment. Only those pediatric endocrinologists that remained at university medical centers with departments able to support a research program had access to NPA growth hormone.

In the late 1970s, a Swedish pharmaceutical company, Kabi, contracted with a number of hospitals in Europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial GH product, Crescormon. Although an additional source of GH was welcomed, Crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. The first concern was that Kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the U.S., which would quickly undermine the NPA, which relied on a donation system like blood transfusion. The second offense was Kabi-Pharmacia&#x27;s marketing campaign, which was directed at primary care physicians under the slogan, &quot;Now, you determine the need,&quot; implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short child might be a candidate for treatment. Although the Crescormon controversy in the U.S. is long forgotten, Kabi&#x27;s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in Europe as recently as 2000.

===Recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH)===
In 1981, the new American corporation Genentech, after collaboration with Kabi, developed and started trials of recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) made by a new technology (recombinant DNA) in which human genes were inserted into bacteria so that they could produce unlimited amounts of the protein. Because this was new technology, approval was deferred as lengthy safety trials continued over the next four years.

In 1985, four young adults in the U.S. having received NPA growth hormone in the 1960s developed CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease). The connection was recognized within a few months, and use of human pituitary GH rapidly ceased. Between 1985 and 2003, a total of 26 cases of CJD occurred in adults having received NPA GH before 1977 (out of 7700), comparable numbers of cases occurred around the world. By 2003 there had been no cases in people who received only GH purified by the improved 1977 methods.

Discontinuation of human cadaver growth hormone led to rapid Food and Drug Administration approval of Genentech&#x27;s recombinant human growth hormone, which was introduced in 1985 as Protropin in the United States. Although this previously scarce commodity was suddenly available in &quot;bucketfuls&quot;, the price of treatment (US$10,000–30,000 per year) was the highest at the time. Genentech justified it by the prolonged research and development investment, orphan drug status, and a pioneering post-marketing surveillance registry for tracking safety and effectiveness (National Cooperative Growth Study).

Within a few years, GH treatment had become more common and competitors entered the market. Eli Lilly launched a competing natural sequence growth hormone (Humatrope). Pharmacia (formerly Kabi, now Pfizer) introduced Genotropin. Novo Nordisk introduced Norditropin. Serono (now EMD Serono) introduced Saizen and Serostim. Ferring has introduced Zomacton. Genentech eventually introduced another HGH product, Nutropin, and stopped making Protropin in 2004. Price competition had begun. Teva, which is primarily a generics company, has introduced Tev-tropin. Chinese companies have entered the market as well and have introduced more pricing competition: NeoGenica BioScience Ltd. introduced Hypertropin, GeneScience introduced Jintropin, Anhui Anke Biotechnology introduced Ansomone, Shanghai United Kefei Biotechnology introduced Kefei HGH, and Hygene BioPharm introduced Hygetropin. These are all recombinant human growth hormone products and they have competed with various marketing strategies. Most children with severe deficiency in the developed world are now likely to have access to a pediatric endocrinologist and be diagnosed and offered treatment.

Pediatric endocrinology became a recognizable specialty in the 1950s, but did not reach board status in the U.S. until the late 1970s. Even 10 years later, as a cognitive, procedureless specialty dealing with mostly rare diseases, it was one of the smallest, lowest-paid, and more obscure of the medical specialities. Pediatric endocrinologists were the only physicians interested in the arcana of GH metabolism and children&#x27;s growth , but their previously academic arguments took on new practical significance with major financial implications.

The major scientific arguments dated back to the days of GH scarcity:
* Everyone agrees on the nature and diagnosis of severe GH deficiency, but what are the edges and variations?
* How should marked constitutional delay be distinguished from partial GH deficiency?
* To what extent is &quot;normal shortness&quot; a matter of short children naturally making less growth hormone?
* Can a child make GH in response to a stimulation test but fail to make enough in &quot;daily life&quot; to grow normally?
* If a stimulation test is used to define deficiency, what GH cutoff should be used to define normal?

It was the ethical questions that were new. Whole meetings were devoted to these questions; pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own bioethics issues.

Despite the price, the 1990s became an era of experimentation to see what else growth hormone could help. The medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable. In most cases, the growth responses were modest. For conditions with a large enough potential market, more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications. Turner syndrome and chronic kidney failure were the first of these &quot;nonGH-deficient causes of shortness&quot; to receive FDA approval for GH treatment, and Prader–Willi syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation followed. Similar expansion of use occurred in Europe.

One obvious potential market was adult GH deficiency. By the mid-1990s, several GH companies had sponsored or publicized research into the quality of life of adults with severe GH deficiency. Most were people having been treated with GH in childhood for severe deficiency. Many of them stopped injections as they reached their final heights in the low-normal range. However, as adults in their 30s and 40s, these people, who had been children with growth hormone deficiency, were now adults with growth hormone deficiency and had more than their share of common adult problems: reduced physical, mental, and social energy, excess adipose and diminished muscle, diminished libido, poor bone density, higher cholesterol levels, and higher rates of cardiovascular disease. Research trials soon confirmed that a few months of GH could improve nearly all of these parameters. However, despite marketing efforts, most GH-deficient adults remain untreated.

Though GH use was slow to be accepted among adults with GH deficiency, similar research to see if GH treatment could slow or reverse some of the similar effects of aging attracted much public interest. The most publicized trial was reported by Daniel Rudman in 1990. As with other types of hormone supplementation for aging (testosterone, estrogen, DHEA), confirmation of benefit and accurate understanding of risks has been only slowly evolving.

In 1997, Ronald Klatz of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine published &quot;Grow Young With HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan To Reverse the Effects Of Aging&quot;, an uncritical touting of GH as the answer to aging. This time, the internet amplified the proposition and spawned a hundred frauds and scams. However, their adoption of the &quot;HGH&quot; term has provided an easy way to distinguish the hype from the evidence. In 2003, growth hormone hit the news again, when the US FDA granted Eli Lilly approval to market Humatrope for the treatment of idiopathic short stature. The indication was controversial for several reasons, the primary one being the difficulty in defining extreme shortness with normal test results as a disease rather than the extreme end of the normal height range

Recombinant growth hormone available in the U.S. (and their manufacturers) include &quot;Nutropin&quot; (Genentech), &quot;Humatrope&quot; (Eli Lilly and Company), &quot;Genotropin&quot; (Pfizer), &quot;Norditropin&quot; (Novo Nordisk), &quot;Tev-Tropin&quot; (Teva) and &quot;Saizen&quot; (Merck Serono). The products are nearly identical in composition, efficacy, and cost, varying primarily in the formulations and delivery devices.

Somapacitan-beco (Sogroya) is the first once-per week subcutaneous human growth hormone (hGH) therapy that was approved in the United States. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020.

==Terminology==
Growth hormone (GH l) is also called somatotropin (British: somatotrophin). The human form of growth hormone is known as human growth hormone, or hGH (ovine growth hormone, or sheep growth hormone, is abbreviated oGH). GH can refer either to the natural hormone produced by the pituitary (somatotropin), or biosynthetic GH for therapy.

Cadaver growth hormone is the term for GH extracted from the pituitary glands of human cadavers between 1960 and 1985 for therapy of deficient children. In the U.S., cadaver GH, also referred to as NPA growth hormone, was provided by the National Pituitary Agency, and by other national programs and commercial firms as well. In 1985 it was associated with the development of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and was withdrawn from use.

RHGH (rHGH, rhGH) refers to recombinant human growth hormone, that is, somatropin (INN). Its amino acid sequence is identical with that of endogenous human GH.

It is coincidental that RHGH also refers to rhesus monkey GH (RhGH), using the accepted naming convention of &quot;Rh&quot; for &quot;rhesus&quot;. Rhesus growth hormone was never used by physicians to treat human patients, but rhesus GH was part of the lore of the underground anabolic steroid community in those years, and fraudulent versions may have been bought and sold in gyms.

met-GH refers to methionyl–growth hormone, that is, somatrem (INN). This was the first recombinant GH product marketed (trade name Protropin by Genentech). It had the same amino acid sequence as human GH with an extra methionine at the end of the chain to facilitate the manufacturing process. It was discontinued in 2004.

rBST refers to recombinant bovine somatotropin (cow growth hormone), or recombinant bovine GH (rbGH, RBGH).

<text>Avi Arad (; ; born August 1, 1948) is an Israeli-American studio executive and producer of film, television and animation. He became the CEO of Toy Biz in the 1990s, was the chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment and is the founder, former chairman and former CEO of the latter&#x27;s successor, Marvel Studios. Since then, he has produced and sometimes written a wide array of live-action, animated, and television comic book adaptations.

== Early life ==
Arad was born in 1948 in Ramat Gan, Israel, to a Jewish family. The son of Holocaust survivors from Poland, he grew up reading Superman and Spider-Man comics translated into Hebrew. In 1965, he was conscripted as a soldier into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He fought and was wounded in the 1967 Six-Day War, and spent 15 days recuperating. Arad finished his military service in 1968.

In 1970, Arad moved to the United States and enrolled at Hofstra University to study industrial management. He worked as a truck driver and as a Hebrew teacher to put himself through college, and graduated with a BBA in 1972.

==Career==
=== Marvel Comics ===
Along with Israeli-American Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter, Avi Arad came into conflict with Carl Icahn and Ron Perelman over control of Marvel Comics in the wake of its 1996 bankruptcy. In the end, Arad and Perlmutter came out on top, with Toy Biz taking over Marvel Comics in a complicated deal that included obtaining the rights to Spider-Man and other superheroes that Marvel had sold earlier. He was involved in Marvel&#x27;s emergence from bankruptcy and the expansion of the company&#x27;s profile through licensing and movies.

=== Arad Productions ===
On May 31, 2006, Arad resigned his various Marvel positions, including his leadership of Marvel Studios, to form his own production company, Arad Productions (also known as Arad Animation), a company that primarily produces Marvel-licensed films separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first non-Marvel film was 2007&#x27;s &quot;Bratz&quot;. Further ventures include manga adaptation &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;; an adaptation of Brandon Mull&#x27;s teenage fantasy &quot;Fablehaven&quot; (which died in production); an adaptation of James Patterson&#x27;s teenage novel &quot;Maximum Ride&quot;; and adaptations of video game properties &quot;Uncharted&quot;, &quot;Infamous&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

=== Production I.G ===
In August 2010, it was announced that Arad was given a chair with the American branch of animation studio Production I.G in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="622423" wikidata="Q377992" url="?curid=622423" title="Chuck Austen">
<text>Chuck Austen (born Chuck Beckum) is an American comic book writer and artist, television writer and producer. In the comics industry, he is known for his work on &quot;U.S. War Machine&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;JLA&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot; and the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise. In television, he is known for co-creating the animated TV series &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot;, producing the first season of &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, and acting as a co-showrunner on &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;.

==Early life==
Chuck Austen was born Chuck Beckum. He grew up a military brat, and after his parents divorced, he was raised by his single mother in a housing project. At the start of his career Austen used his birthname; he later abandoned out of a desire to disassociate from his father&#x27;s family name. After marrying, he and his wife picked a new name, inspired by Jane Austen.

==Career==
Austen began his career as an artist in the 1980s. Due to not knowing many comics fans he developed a habit of inking his own pencils. After working on Eclipse Comics titles such as &quot;Twisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Alien Worlds&quot;, his work came to the attention of Alan Moore, who selected him to take over from Alan Davis on &quot;Miracleman&quot;, recently added to the company&#x27;s portfolio. He met Moore for the first time at the 1985 San Diego Comic Con, where he was also announced as the new artist on the title. As the series initially reprinted material from the British anthology &quot;Warrior&quot; his work on the main strip started in &quot;Miracleman&quot; #6, cover dated February 1986. Austen&#x27;s run on the title was short-lived - after contributing a framing sequence to &quot;Miracleman&quot; #8 he left.

Subsequently, he drew the first five issues for the short-lived series &quot;Hero Sandwich&quot; for Slave Labor Graphics, as well as stints on &quot;The Badger&quot; for First Comics and two issues of Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Zot!&quot;, covering for the artist&#x27;s honeymoon. Austen also wrote and drew the semi-autobiographical black-and-white adult comic book series &quot;Strips&quot; for Rip Off Press and the similarly-themed &quot;Hardball&quot; for Malibu Comics&#x27; Aircel Comics label. He also provided art to lesser-known series such as &quot;Open Season&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot; as well as a few DC Comics properties including a Phantom Lady serial for &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; and a short Green Flame story for &quot;Secret Origins&quot;. Before taking a break from comics, Austen also drew an issue of &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid&quot; limited series, due to the high page rates Disney offered and the chance to work with Peter David. He subsequently took a hiatus from the comics industry, instead working on the television show &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

Austen returned to comics in 2001, feeling burnt out after finding little success in the film and television industry. He began looking at comics again and sent samples of his art to Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who was impressed enough to offer Austen the chance to illustrate the new Marvel Knights &quot;Elektra&quot; series, written by &quot;Brian Michael Bendis&quot;. He would remain as the title&#x27;s artist until &quot;Elektra&quot; #8. Soon after being commissioned, he also began writing and illustrating the weekly maxi-series &quot;U.S. War Machine&quot; for then-recently launched Marvel MAX imprint. The series drew controversy not only for its violent content, but also because it debuted the day after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2003, Austen followed up with &quot;U.S. War Machine 2.0&quot;, which was published the day after U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s March 17, 2003 ultimatum to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq, prompting Austen to jokingly comment, &quot;I feel like I should stop doing this book so the world will stay at peace.&quot; Using the creative liberties provided due to the fact that series was set outside the mainline Marvel Universe, Austen wrote Rhodes&#x27; boss Tony Stark as more pacifist and business-minded than his mainstream counterpart, and Rhodes himself as the proactive protector. Also in 2003, Austen launched another series for Marvel MAX, the six-issue &quot;The Eternal&quot; with artist Kev Walker, a reimagining of Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Eternals&quot;.

In 2002, Austen took over &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; with issue #410 and remained on the title until #443. The two-year run was the most lengthy writing assignment in Austen&#x27;s mainstream career, although it was not well received by the fans of the franchise. His controversial run saw the return of Havok and Polaris to the X-Men, the introduction of Havok&#x27;s love interest Annie Ghazikhanian, and the addition of several existing characters to the X-Men team, including Northstar, Juggernaut, M, and Husk. The most controversial storyline revealed the identity of Nightcrawler&#x27;s father: an immortal mutant known as Azazel. Austen moved to &quot;New X-Men&quot; as part of the X-Men Reload initiative, and wrote the series for nine issues. During this run, he showcased the beginning of the relationship between Cyclops and Emma Frost following the death of Jean Grey and introduced new versions of the character Xorn and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Michael Aronson of Silver Bullet Comics, while praising Austen&#x27;s characterization of Professor X and Annie Ghazikhanian, excoriated Austen for what Aronson saw as his obsession with relationships and sex, and the sexist nature of his characterization of Husk. According to Thor K. Jensen of UGO Entertainment, fans disliked the romantic pairing of Angel and Husk; Jensen cites that storyline as emblematic of critical reception to Austen&#x27;s run on &quot;X-Men&quot;.

In 2003, Austen wrote a brief run on &quot;Captain America&quot;, finishing the storylines that were started by the outgoing writer John Ney Rieber. In 2004, Austen took over &quot;The Avengers&quot;, introducing a new, female Captain Britain (since renamed Lionheart), a single mother thrust into the realm of super-heroes after being killed as an innocent bystander during a fight between the Avengers and the Wrecking Crew, only to be resurrected by the original Captain Britain. The second arc, which saw Austen writing former Avengers U.S. Agent and Namor the Sub-Mariner attempting to liberate a Middle Eastern country from its corrupt leadership, served as launching pad for the short-lived &quot;New Invaders&quot; series. Non-superhero Marvel work of the time includes &quot;The Call of Duty&quot;, a project consisting of several mini-series conceived in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks that were written primarily by Austen (with one series written by Bruce Jones) and featured firefighters and emergency service workers dealing with paranormal phenomena in the Marvel Universe, as well as &quot;Eden&#x27;s Trail&quot; with artist Steve Uy, a series in &quot;&quot;Marvelscope&quot; (&quot;landscape) format created to capitalize on the burgeoning manga market which resulted in controversy when Uy publicly disowned the project, calling it a &quot;bad dream&quot;.

Also in 2003, Austen returned to DC Comics with the limited series &quot;Superman: Metropolis&quot; which followed the life of Jimmy Olsen and other citizens of the eponymous fictional city. After the series concluded with issue #12, Austen took over the writing duties of the ongoing series &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Fans criticized Austen for resurrecting the long-forgotten Silver Age feud between Lois Lane and Lana Lang over the love of Superman, with Lana in particular divorcing her longtime husband Pete Ross in the process. Austen left the title after ten issues, and the following two issues were scripted by a writer named &quot;J.D. Finn&quot;. While readers suspected Finn to be Austen, he speculated that Finn was actually then–&quot;Action Comics&quot; editor Eddie Berganza and denied using the pseudonym.

In 2004, Austen began self-publishing &quot;WorldWatch&quot;, a superhero series which he described as similar to Warren Ellis&#x27;s &quot;The Authority&quot; with more explicit depictions of sex, violence and realpolitik. The last page of &quot;Worldwatch&quot; #2 featured an announcement from the publisher stating that Austen had been fired, and that he would be replaced by a writer named Sam Clemens (which is the real name of American writer Mark Twain). In a subsequent interview, Austen revealed that this was intended as a joke (since he himself was the publisher and thus could not be fired from the book) and expressed disappointment in the fact that most readers had not understood it.

In 2006, Austen wrote &quot;Boys of Summer&quot;, an English language adult-themed manga illustrated by Hiroki Otsuka and published by TokyoPop. Copies of the first volume were pulled from a number of bookstores in May that year due to its graphic content. Publishers Weekly named &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; one of the Top Ten manga/manhwa of 2006, calling it both &quot;a titillating and edgy reading experience.&quot; Subsequent news reports indicated that the series had been cancelled even though the other two volumes were completed and both creators had been paid for the work.

Austen spent most of the 2010s working in various capacities in animation on such shows as &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Croods&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. Most recently, he served as the co-showrunner on &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;.

In 2007, Austen released his first prose novel, &quot;Like Warm Sun on Nekkid Bottoms&quot;. In 2011, writing as Charles Olen Austen, he released the three-book series &quot;Pride and Nakedness&quot;, followed by &quot;Something Old, Something New&quot; in 2013.

In 2020, Austen returned to comics with &quot;Edgeworld&quot;, a five-part series with artist Pat Oliffe, published digitally via Comixology.

==Reception==
During his stint at the Big Two, Austen used the expression &quot;Seven Deadly Trolls&quot;. In Austen&#x27;s point of view, there was a small group of people, not representative of the wider comics readership, that used internet message boards, blogs and newsgroups to attack him on a professional and personal level. Austen has stated that he received death threats from fans and had certain comic book store owners refuse to stock any comics written by him. He also admitted to taking online criticism of his work personally, and made a decision to stop doing interviews in August 2003. In a 2004 interview, Austen explained that decision as a result of a &quot;bad day&quot;.

==Influences==
Austen has expressed admiration towards such comic book creators as Brian Michael Bendis, Paul Jenkins, Bill Sienkiewicz, J. Michael Straczynski, Ron Garney, Bret Blevins, J. H. Williams III, Al Williamson, John Romita, Sr., Rumiko Takahashi, Katsuhiro Otomo and Mitsuru Adachi.

==Techniques==
Austen creates his art digitally, using mostly Macs and sometimes PCs. He utilizes a variety of programs including &quot;Ray Dream Studio&quot; and &quot;3D Studio Max&quot; to compose scenes which he then finishes in Photoshop.

==Personal life==
Austen is divorced. He has two daughters and a son.

He identifies himself as humanitarian and anti-racist. In Austen&#x27;s view, the Republican Party discriminates against women, and he especially disliked the Bush administration.

<text>The suburb of Plimmerton lies in the northwest part of the city of Porirua in New Zealand, adjacent to some of the city&#x27;s more congenial beaches. State Highway 59 and the North Island Main Trunk railway line pass just east of the main shopping and residential area.

Plimmerton has its modern origins as a late 19th century seaside resort. It is named after John Plimmer, an English settler and entrepreneur who, through the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, helped to fund and direct construction of the railway line. The estimated population is as of 

==History==
The area was first settled by the Māori people early in their occupation of New Zealand. Ngāi Tara and then Ngāti Ira settled south of Kāpiti, and a number of other tribes may have lived in the area including Muaūpoko, Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Hotu.

Ngāti Toa people took control of the Porirua coast in the 1820s. In the 1840s the area where Plimmerton is situated was the home of Te Rauparaha, who had his main residence at Taupō pā. Te Rauparaha was captured by 200 British troops and police on 23 July 1846 near the southern end of Motuhara Road. A tiny historic reserve contains a cabbage tree that may be descended from the one he was said to have been captured near, and a plaque. In 1847, most of Ngāti Toa’s land in Porirua was sold to the Crown for the New Zealand Company by a group of eight chiefs, and Taupō was retained as part of a Māori reserve (one of three) that extended from Paremata to Paekākāriki. However, the following year Te Rauparaha was released and retired to Ōtaki; by 1850 Taupō pā was deserted.
The area continued to be referred to as Taupō, after the pā, and was leased by Ngāti Toa for farming by European settlers over the following decades. These included William Cooper, Canington (possible Carrington), and then Levi Tandy (from 1859). James Walker farmed from Paremata to Plimmerton beginning in 1875.

In the late 19th Century Ngāti Toa’s land holdings around Taupō began to rapidly decline as land was by converted to individual title by the Native Land Court and then sold, transferred to the Public Trustee or taken for public works and reserves.

When the Horokiwi Valley Road was opened fewer travellers followed the Taua Tapu track through Taupō to Pukerua Bay. So Pāuatahanui grew at the expense of Taupō until the railway line was opened in 1885.

In the 1880s the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company decided to build a railway link from the capital, Wellington, to Longburn, near Palmerston North. Several towns, including Plimmerton, were established along the way to encourage settlements that would contribute to the line&#x27;s business. John Plimmer, after whom Plimmerton was named, was a director of the company.

In 1885 the first excursion train journeyed from Wellington to Plimmerton on 3 September, and regular services began from 10 October. With the railway&#x27;s arrival, Plimmerton became accessible to holidaymakers, and evolved into a seaside resort. Plimmerton House, a two-storied hotel, was built alongside the railway station in 1886 (and burnt down in 1907). Sections began to be sold in 1888 and by the late 1890s Plimmerton had become a popular holiday destination. In 1900 Plimmerton consisted of 30 summer cottages, two private hotels and one general store.

Plimmerton was originally part of Hutt County. On 1 April 1973 the still-growing area became one of the northern suburbs of Porirua. Though small, it was one of the most lively. For a time it had the only active Residents&#x27; Association in the city.

The main state highway route through Plimmerton, previously part of , was renumbered SH 59 on 7 December 2021 due to SH 1 being shifted to the Transmission Gully Motorway.

==Official name==
The name Plimmerton was used in promoting the railway and advertising of sections for sale from the mid-1880s.

Plimmerton was gazetted as an official geographic name on 3 November 2011. The suburb amalgamated the previous recorded suburb names of Plimmerton and Karehana Bay. It excludes the largely Māori (Ngāti Toa) settlement of Hongoeka to the west, which was gazetted on 16 December 2010.

== Demographics and census information ==
The Plimmerton statistical area covers , and includes Hongoeka. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Plimmerton had a population of 2,142 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 27 people (1.3%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 90 people (4.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 840 households, comprising 1,062 males and 1,080 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. The median age was 44.0 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 399 people (18.6%) aged under 15 years, 339 (15.8%) aged 15 to 29, 1,026 (47.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 378 (17.6%) aged 65 or older.

The percentage of people born overseas was 23.0, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 58.5% had no religion, 32.6% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.6% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhist and 2.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 687 (39.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 150 (8.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $47,500, compared with $31,800 nationally. 582 people (33.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 969 (55.6%) people were employed full-time, 252 (14.5%) were part-time, and 42 (2.4%) were unemployed.

==Localities==
State Highway 59, here named St Andrews Road, passes through Plimmerton, as does the North Island Main Trunk railway line

A shopping area about two blocks long adjoins Plimmerton Railway Station on Steyne Avenue and includes a church, a medical centre, Plunket rooms, a craft shop, a beauty salon, real estate agents, a grocery store and several eateries.

To the north alongside the railway line is Plimmerton Domain, comprising 3 football fields, home to the Mana Archery Club, Wellington 29th Boys&#x27; Brigade and the Mana Arts Society. Beyond is the Plimmerton Industrial Estate, which includes numerous businesses, the Plimmerton Croquet Club, and a storage facility for the New Zealand Film Archive.

The Mainline Steam railway preservation group have their extensive restoration facilities located behind Plimmerton Railway Station.

North of the industrial area is the Taupō Swamp, a flax swamp, one of the largest of its type in the southern half of the North Island. Taupō Stream passes south through the swamp, along the east edge of Plimmerton Domain, between Steyne Avenue and St Andrews Road, and then flows into the sea at the north end of South Beach.

Plimmerton Library, which was part of Porirua City Council&#x27;s library system, closed on 27 July 2012. It opened in the late 1940s and operated from a single-room building near the school from November 1951 until December 2007. It then shifted to the Plimmerton Pavilion, opposite the Plimmerton Volunteer Fire Brigade building, until its closure.

South-west of the shopping area is Plimmerton Beach, a fairly sheltered, gently graded beach, which has been a popular recreation area for over a century. It is popular with windsurfers; some world champions have trained there. At the southern end is South Beach. Recreational water quality at Plimmerton Beach is rated &quot;fair&quot; by the Greater Wellington Regional Council; water quality at South Beach is rated &quot;poor&quot;, however, due to periodic faecal contamination. This contamination may originate from Taupō Swamp (via Taupō Stream), which often supports a large waterfowl population.

Another popular beach is Karehana Bay, at the foot of the Airlie Road/Cluny Road valley about 1.5 kilometres north-west of the shops. Poet Denis Glover mentioned the settlement in his poem Threnody: &quot;In Plimmerton, in Plimmerton, the little penguins play, and one dead albatross was found at Karehana Bay&quot;.

<text>Andrew Kubert (; born February 27, 1962) is an American comics artist, letterer, and writer. He is the son of Joe Kubert and brother of Adam Kubert, both of whom are also artists, and the uncle of comics editor Katie Kubert. 

Kubert is a graduate of and an instructor of second-year classes at The Kubert School, founded by his father, who also taught there, and would later serve as an instructor there himself. After beginning his career as a letterer at DC Comics, Kubert went on to illustrate books for that company including &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; and &quot;Adam Strange&quot;, as well its intercompany crossover with Dark Horse Comics, &quot;Batman Versus Predator&quot;. 

He later worked for Marvel Comics, illustrated various &quot;X-Men&quot; and Ultimate Marvel-related titles, including &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot;, and provided artwork for notable storylines such as &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; in 1995. He returned to DC in 2005, where he provided art for storylines such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?, &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot;. During his run on &quot;Batman&quot; with writer Grant Morrison, they co-created the character Damian Wayne.

==Early life==
Andrew Kubert is the son of Muriel (&quot;née&quot; Fogelson) and Joe Kubert, the latter of whom came from a Jewish family in southeast Poland (now Ukraine). His siblings include a sister, Lisa, and brothers David, Daniel, and Adam. He and his siblings were raised in Dover, New Jersey. He is also the uncle of comics editor Katie Kubert. He graduated from The Kubert School, which was founded by his father in Dover.

==Career==
Andy Kubert started his comics career as a letterer at DC Comics in 1980. His first credited artwork for the company was the story &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot; in &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; #393 (Oct. 1984). He later drew &quot;Adam Strange&quot; and the &quot;Batman Versus Predator&quot; intercompany crossover. He is best known for his work at Marvel Comics, specifically the company&#x27;s X-Men titles. An occasional cover artist on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (drawing the first cover appearance of the character Gambit) and &quot;X-Men Classic&quot;, Kubert later served as a fill-in penciller for &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #279-280 and #288 before becoming the regular penciller on &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2 (starting with #14), following Jim Lee&#x27;s departure from Marvel to form Image Comics. Kubert was one of the artists of the &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot; storyline which ran through the X-Men titles in 1992 and drew the wedding of Cyclops and Jean Grey in &quot;X-Men&quot; #30 (March 1994). Kubert drew the &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot; limited series as part of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline in 1995. In 2001, Kubert drew two issues of the new &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; title. With writers Bill Jemas, Joe Quesada and Paul Jenkins, Kubert produced the &quot;Origin&quot; limited series which revealed the early history of Wolverine. Kubert collaborated with novelist Neil Gaiman on the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; eight-issue limited series published from November 2003 to June 2004. Writer Orson Scott Card and Kubert crafted the &quot;Ultimate Iron Man&quot; limited series in 2005.

Both Kubert and his brother, Adam, signed exclusive contracts to work for DC Comics in 2005. Andy Kubert became the penciller of the &quot;Batman&quot; series and with writer Grant Morrison introduced the Damian Wayne character.

He illustrated the covers to &quot;&quot;, a three-issue miniseries published in November 2008. Kubert drew the two-issue Batman story by Neil Gaiman entitled, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?&quot; This reunited Gaiman and Kubert, who previously worked together on the series &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;.

While his brother Adam has returned to Marvel Comics following his three-year deal with DC, Dan DiDio confirmed in 2009 that following &quot;Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?&quot;, Kubert had two more Batman projects in the works, one of which he would write himself. He contributed covers to the &quot;Blackest Night: Batman&quot; mini-series, as well as variant covers for &quot;Blackest Night&quot; issues of &quot;Green Lantern&quot;.

In late 2009, DC announced that Andy Kubert was working on two DC stories, one featuring Batman, the other featuring the DCU. Kubert&#x27;s father Joe inked over his pencils on the first two issues of &quot;DC Universe: Legacies&quot;, a 10-issue series chronicling the history of the DC Universe. Andy Kubert contributed to &quot;Batman&quot; #700, teaming again with Grant Morrison to tell another tale of Damian Wayne as Batman in the future as part of the oversized anniversary issue. In 2011 Kubert illustrated the DC miniseries &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. In 2013 Kubert wrote and drew &quot;Damian: Son of the Batman&quot;, a four-issue mini series about Robin in an alternate future. Kubert was one of the artists on &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot; which was co-written by Frank Miller and Brian Azzarello. As of 2018, Kubert is collaborating with writer Scott Snyder on the &quot;New Challengers&quot;, part of the &quot;Dark Metal&quot; project.

In 2020, DC Comics announced that Kubert would be among the creators of a revived &quot;Batman: Black and White&quot; anthology series to debut on December 8, 2020.

<text>&quot;The Banner of Freedom&quot; ( ), known also as &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Samoa, Arise&quot;) is the national anthem of Samoa. Both the words (which reference the country&#x27;s flag) and the music were composed by Sauni Iiga Kuresa. The anthem was composed in response to a public competition to select a new anthem when the United Nations conferred self-government on Samoa in 1948 and was chosen from among 15 entries. It was performed publicly for the first time on 1 June 1948 and was subsequently played at all public ceremonies attended by the High Commissioner and performed after &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; on official occasions. It was retained as the national anthem upon Samoa&#x27;s gaining of independence from New Zealand in 1962.

The anthem is recognised by the &quot;Official Flag and National Anthem of Samoa Act 1994&quot;. When it is sung or played in public, people and vehicles must stop and remain stationary until the performance is complete.

<text>Lieutenant Commander Nicholas John Turney Monsarrat FRSL RNVR ( 22 March 19108 August 1979) was a British novelist known for his sea stories, particularly &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1951) and &quot;Three Corvettes&quot; (1942–1945), but perhaps known best internationally for his novels, &quot;The Tribe That Lost Its Head&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Richer Than All His Tribe&quot;.

== Early life ==
Monsarrat was born on Rodney Street in Liverpool, Lancashire, to parents Keith Waldegrave Monsarrat FRCS (among the most eminent surgeons of his time) and Marguerite Turney. Monsarrat was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. In his autobiography, he wrote that the 1931 Invergordon Naval Mutiny influenced his interest in politics and social and economic issues after college.

He had intended to practise law, but decided to pursue working as an author instead. He moved to London and wrote as a freelancer for newspapers. He wrote four novels and a play in the space of five years (1934–1939).

==Wartime service==
Though critical of military violence, Monsarrat served during World War II, first as a member of an ambulance brigade and then as a member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). His lifelong love of sailing made him a capable naval officer, and he served with distinction in a series of small warships (corvettes and frigates), assigned to escort convoys and protect them from enemy attack. Monsarrat ended the war as commander of a frigate, and drew on his wartime experience in his postwar sea stories.

Resigning his wartime commission during 1946, Monsarrat entered the diplomatic service. He was posted at first to Johannesburg, South Africa and then, in 1953, to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He began writing full-time during 1959, settling first on Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, and later on the Maltese island of Gozo.

===Ranks ===
* July 1940: Sub-Lieutenant
* October 1940: Lieutenant
* December 1943: Lieutenant Commander

===Appointments===
* Aug 1940 – Dec 1941: 1st Lt, HMS &quot;Campanula&quot; ()
* Feb 1942 – Feb 1943: 1st Lt, HMS &quot;Guillemot&quot; (&quot;Kingfisher&quot;-class corvette)
* Mar 1943 – Oct 1943: CO, HMS &quot;Shearwater&quot; (&quot;Kingfisher&quot;-class corvette)
* Dec 1943 – Mar 1944: CO, HMS &quot;Ettrick&quot; ()
* Apr 1944 – Dec 1944: CO, (: a US-built version of the River class)
* Dec 1944 – Jul 1945: Dept. of Naval Information

&quot;HMS &quot;Flower&quot;&quot; and &quot;HMS &quot;Compass Rose&quot;&quot; were Flower-class corvettes in the short story &quot;H M Corvette&quot; (1942) and the novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1951), though the first was a pseudonym for his first ship, &quot;Campanula&quot;, due to war-time security, while the second was fictional.

&quot;HMS &quot;Dipper&quot;&quot; and &quot;HMS &quot;Winger&quot;&quot; were pseudonyms for the &quot;Kingfisher&quot;-class corvettes in the stories &quot;East Coast Corvette&quot; (1943) and &quot;Corvette Command&quot; (1944), (republished with &quot;H M Corvette&quot; as &quot;Three Corvettes&quot; in 1945). Again, LCdr Monsarrat could not disclose the actual names of the ships he was serving in since these stories were also written during World War II.

&quot;HMS &quot;River&quot;&quot; and &quot;HMS &quot;Saltash&quot; were fictional River-class frigates in &quot;H M Frigate&quot; (1946), and the novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1951). (In the 1953 film version HMS &quot;Saltash&quot; was depicted by : , and hence named &quot;Saltash Castle&quot;&quot;). As with the Flower class corvettes, the first was a pseudonym for the frigate he commanded, while the second was again fictional.

== Work ==

Monsarrat&#x27;s first three novels, published during 1934–1937 and now out of print, were realistic treatments of modern social problems informed by his leftist politics. &quot;The Visitor&quot;, his only play, was in the same category. His fourth novel and first major work, &quot;This Is the Schoolroom&quot;, had a different theme. The story of a young, idealistic, aspiring writer experiencing the &quot;real world&quot; for the first time, it is at least partly autobiographical.

&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1951), Monsarrat&#x27;s first postwar novel, is widely regarded as his best work. Based on his own wartime service, it concerned the young naval officer Keith Lockhart during a series of postings in corvettes and frigates. It was one of the first novels to depict life aboard the vital, but unglamorous, &quot;small ships&quot; of World War II — ships for which the sea was as much a threat as the enemy. Monsarrat&#x27;s short-story collections &quot;HMS Marlborough Will Enter Harbour&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Ship That Died of Shame&quot; (1959, made into a movie of the same name), had the same theme and gained popularity by association with &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;.

The similar &quot;Three Corvettes&quot; (1945 and 1953) comprising &quot;HM Corvette&quot; (set aboard a Flower-class corvette in the North Atlantic), &quot;East Coast Corvette&quot; (as First Lieutenant of HMS &quot;Guillemot&quot;) and &quot;Corvette Command&quot; (as Commanding Officer of ) is actually an anthology of three true-experience stories he published during the war years and shows appropriate care for what the Censor might say. Thus &quot;Guillemot&quot; has the pseudonym &quot;Dipper&quot; and &quot;Shearwater&quot; the pseudonym &quot;Winger&quot; in the book. &quot;HM Frigate&quot; is similar but deals with his time in command of two frigates. His use of the name &quot;Dipper&quot; could allude to his formative years when summer holidays were spent with his family at Trearddur Bay on Anglesey. They were members of the famous sailing club based there, and he recounted much of this part of his life in a book &quot;My Brother Denys&quot;. Denys Monsarrat was killed in Egypt during the middle part of the war whilst his brother was serving with the Royal Navy. Another tale recounts his bringing his ship into Trearddur Bay during the war for old times&#x27; sake.

Monsarrat&#x27;s more famous novels, notably &quot;The Tribe That Lost Its Head&quot; (1956) and its sequel &quot;Richer Than All His Tribe&quot; (1968), draw on his experience in the diplomatic service and make important reference to the colonial experience of Britain in Africa. Portions of these novels were drafted during Monsarrat&#x27;s time in Quebec, Canada, with the assistance of his typist and line editor Helen McDonald (née Lafleur). Several have peripheral associations with the sea: &quot;The Nylon Pirates&quot; (1960) tells a story of crime aboard a modern ocean liner, not pirates in the traditional meaning of the word, but card-sharps, and &quot;A Fair Day&#x27;s Work&quot; (1964) deals with labour unrest in a shipyard. &quot;The Kappillan of Malta&quot; (1973) is as much a story of a place, the island of Malta, as it is of a priest on that island during World War II.

His book &quot;The Story of Esther Costello&quot; (1952), later made into a movie of the same name, while perceived as an uncomplimentary description of the life of Helen Keller and her teachers and assistants, is really an exposé of sleazy practices and exploitation of real causes in the fundraising racket, similar to criticisms of televangelism. It caused a minor public outcry when it first appeared, and Keller&#x27;s staff considered suing him, then tried to limit the distribution of the book.

His final work, unfinished at the time of his death but published in its incomplete form, was a two-volume historical novel titled &quot;The Master Mariner.&quot; Based on the legend of the Wandering Jew, it told the story of a 16th-century English seaman who, as punishment for a terrible act of cowardice, is doomed to sail the world&#x27;s seas until the end of time. His hero participates in critical moments in history; Monsarrat used him to emphasize the importance of seamen.

===Autobiography===
Two non-fiction books, &quot;Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking In&quot; (London, 1966) and &quot;Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking Out&quot; (London, 1970), comprise Monsarrat&#x27;s autobiography.

==Death==
Nicholas Monsarrat died of cancer on 8 August 1979 in London. The Royal Navy co-operated with his wish to be buried at sea. The two naval ratings responsible for the lifting of the casket at his burial were AB Graham Savage and AB Stephen Knight, aboard HMS &quot;Scylla&quot;.

<text>Serene, Colorado is an extinct coal mining company town that was owned by the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company. Serene was located at the site of the Columbine Mine and had company housing and a coal preparation plant. The Serene post office operated from January 25, 1923, until August 31, 1942. Serene was the site of the Columbine Mine Massacre on November 21, 1927.

==History==
In 1927, Colorado coal miners conducted a statewide strike that had been called by the Industrial Workers of the World. The Columbine Mine at Serene was the only major coal mine in the state that continued to dig coal. In her book &quot;Once A Coal Miner&quot;, author Phyllis Smith described the company town of Serene:

:...a collection of dirty company houses surrounded by a barricade of barbed wire, illuminated at night by a giant searchlight that was installed on the Columbine tipple.

:In addition to living quarters for the employees of the Columbine, Serene boasted a church, a gambling hall, general store, mess hall, a house of prostitution, and the United States post office...

:Because of its location, Serene was &quot;cut off from the world and from outside workers ... despite its name, dingy little Serene epitomized the conditions the miners were striking against.&quot;

The Colorado State Ranger Unit (the former &quot;dry unit&quot; from prohibition days) was summoned to prevent a demonstration by striking coal miners.

Some 500 protestors showed up at the mine on the morning of November 21. The confrontation between strikers and the militia unit resulted in the Columbine Mine Massacre, in which six miners were killed by machine gun, rifle and pistol fire.

== Geography ==
Serene was located on rolling hills just west of the present-day Interstate 25 on State Highway 7, north of the State of Colorado Historical Marker that commemorates the Columbine Mine Massacre. The area that once was the company town of Serene is now a public landfill in extreme southwestern Weld County, within the town limits of Erie at .
