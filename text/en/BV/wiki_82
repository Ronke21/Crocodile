<text>The Encrypting File System (EFS) on Microsoft Windows is a feature introduced in version 3.0 of NTFS that provides filesystem-level encryption. The technology enables files to be transparently encrypted to protect confidential data from attackers with physical access to the computer.

EFS is available in all versions of Windows except the home versions (see Supported operating systems below) from Windows 2000 onwards. By default, no files are encrypted, but encryption can be enabled by users on a per-file, per-directory, or per-drive basis. Some EFS settings can also be mandated via Group Policy in Windows domain environments.

Cryptographic file system implementations for other operating systems are available, but the Microsoft EFS is not compatible with any of them. See also the list of cryptographic file systems.

==Basic ideas==

When an operating system is running on a system without file encryption, access to files normally goes through OS-controlled user authentication and access control lists. However, if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, this barrier can be easily circumvented. One way, for example, would be to remove the disk and put it in another computer with an OS installed that can read the filesystem; another, would be to simply reboot the computer from a boot CD containing an OS that is suitable for accessing the local filesystem.

The most widely accepted solution to this is to store the files encrypted on the physical media (disks, USB pen drives, tapes, CDs and so on).

In the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems EFS enables this measure, although on NTFS drives only, and does so using a combination of public key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography to make decrypting the files extremely difficult without the correct key.

However, the cryptography keys for EFS are in practice protected by the user account password, and are therefore susceptible to most password attacks. In other words, the encryption of a file is only as strong as the password to unlock the decryption key.

==Operation==

EFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk symmetric key, also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK. It uses a symmetric encryption algorithm because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher is used. The symmetric encryption algorithm used will vary depending on the version and configuration of the operating system; see Algorithms used by Windows version below. The FEK (the symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file) is then encrypted with a public key that is associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted FEK is stored in the $EFS alternative data stream of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the EFS component driver uses the private key that matches the EFS digital certificate (used to encrypt the file) to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the $EFS stream. The EFS component driver then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because the encryption &amp; decryption operations are performed at a layer below NTFS, it is transparent to the user and all their applications.

Folders whose contents are to be encrypted by the file system are marked with an encryption attribute. The EFS component driver treats this encryption attribute in a way that is analogous to the inheritance of file permissions in NTFS: if a folder is marked for encryption, then by default all files and subfolders that are created under the folder are also encrypted. When encrypted files are moved within an NTFS volume, the files remain encrypted. However, there are a number of occasions in which the file could be decrypted without the user explicitly asking Windows to do so.

Files and folders are decrypted before being copied to a volume formatted with another file system, like FAT32. Finally, when encrypted files are copied over the network using the SMB/CIFS protocol, the files are decrypted before they are sent over the network.

The most significant way of preventing the decryption-on-copy is using backup applications that are aware of the &quot;Raw&quot; APIs. Backup applications that have implemented these Raw APIs will simply copy the encrypted file stream and the $EFS alternative data stream as a single file. In other words, the files are &quot;copied&quot; (e.g. into the backup file) in encrypted form, and are not decrypted during backup.

Starting with Windows Vista, a user&#x27;s private key can be stored on a smart card; Data Recovery Agent (DRA) keys can also be stored on a smart card.

==Security==
===Vulnerabilities===
Two significant security vulnerabilities existed in Windows 2000 EFS, and have been variously targeted since.

In Windows 2000, the local administrator is the default Data Recovery Agent, capable of decrypting all files encrypted with EFS by any local user.
EFS in Windows 2000 cannot function without a recovery agent, so there is always someone who can decrypt encrypted files of the users. Any non-domain-joined Windows 2000 computer will be susceptible to unauthorized EFS decryption by anyone who can take over the local Administrator account, which is trivial given many tools available freely on the Internet.

In Windows XP and later, there is no default local Data Recovery Agent and no requirement to have one. Setting SYSKEY to mode 2 or 3 (syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate the risk of unauthorized decryption through the local Administrator account. This is because the local user&#x27;s password hashes, stored in the SAM file, are encrypted with the Syskey, and the Syskey value is not available to an offline attacker who does not possess the Syskey passphrase/floppy.

====Accessing private key via password reset====
In Windows 2000, the user&#x27;s RSA private key is not only stored in a &quot;truly&quot; encrypted form, but there is also a backup of the user&#x27;s RSA private key that is more weakly protected. If an attacker gains physical access to the Windows 2000 computer and resets a local user account&#x27;s password, the attacker can log in as that user (or recovery agent) and gain access to the RSA private key which can decrypt all files. This is because the backup of the user&#x27;s RSA private key is encrypted with an LSA secret, which is accessible to any attacker who can elevate their login to LocalSystem (again, trivial given numerous tools on the Internet).

In Windows XP and beyond, the user&#x27;s RSA private key is backed up using an offline public key whose matching private key is stored in one of two places: the password reset disk (if Windows XP is not a member of a domain) or in the Active Directory (if Windows XP is a member of a domain). This means that an attacker who can authenticate to Windows XP as LocalSystem still does not have access to a decryption key stored on the PC&#x27;s hard drive.

In Windows 2000, XP or later, the user&#x27;s RSA private key is encrypted using a hash of the user&#x27;s NTLM password hash plus the user name – use of a salted hash makes it extremely difficult to reverse the process and recover the private key without knowing the user&#x27;s passphrase. Also, again, setting Syskey to mode 2 or 3 (Syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate this attack, since the local user&#x27;s password hash will be stored encrypted in the SAM file.

===Other issues===
Once a user is logged on successfully, access to his own EFS encrypted data requires no additional authentication, decryption happens transparently. Thus, any compromise of the user&#x27;s password automatically leads to access to that data. Windows can store versions of user account passphrases with reversible encryption, though this is no longer default behaviour; it can also be configured to store (and will by default on the original version of Windows XP and lower) Lan Manager hashes of the local user account passphrases, which can be attacked and broken easily. It also stores local user account passphrases as NTLM hashes, which can be fairly easily attacked using &quot;rainbow tables&quot; if the passwords are weak (Windows Vista and later versions don&#x27;t allow weak passwords by default). To mitigate the threat of trivial brute-force attacks on local passphrases, older versions of Windows need to be configured (using the Security Settings portion of Group Policy) to never store LM hashes, and of course, to not enable Autologon (which stores plaintext passphrases in the registry). Further, using local user account passphrases over 14 characters long prevents Windows from storing an LM hash in the SAM – and has the added benefit of making brute-force attacks against the NTLM hash harder.

When encrypting files with EFS – when converting plaintext files to encrypted files – the plaintext files are not wiped, but simply deleted (i.e. data blocks flagged as &quot;not in use&quot; in the filesystem). This means that, unless they for example happen to be stored on an SSD with TRIM support, they can be easily recovered unless they are overwritten. To fully mitigate known, non-challenging technical attacks against EFS, encryption should be configured at the folder level (so that all temporary files like Word document backups which are created in these directories are also encrypted). When encrypting individual files, they should be copied to an encrypted folder or encrypted &quot;in place&quot;, followed by securely wiping the disk volume. The Windows Cipher utility can be used (with the /W option) to wipe free space including that which still contains deleted plaintext files; various third-party utilities may work as well.

Anyone who can gain Administrators access can overwrite, override or change the Data Recovery Agent configuration. This is a very serious issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they want as the Data Recovery Agent and wait. This is sometimes referred to as a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.

When the user encrypts files after the first stage of such an attack, the FEKs are automatically encrypted with the designated DRA&#x27;s public key. The attacker only needs to access the computer once more as Administrator to gain full access to all those subsequently EFS-encrypted files. Even using Syskey mode 2 or 3 does not protect against this attack, because the attacker could back up the encrypted files offline, restore them elsewhere and use the DRA&#x27;s private key to decrypt the files. If such a malicious insider can gain physical access to the computer, all security features are to be considered irrelevant, because they could also install rootkits, software or even hardware keyloggers etc. on the computer – which is potentially much more interesting and effective than overwriting DRA policy.

===Recovery===
Files encrypted with EFS can only be decrypted by using the RSA private key(s) matching the previously used public key(s). The stored copy of the user&#x27;s private key is ultimately protected by the user&#x27;s logon password. Accessing encrypted files from outside Windows with other operating systems (Linux, for example) is not possible—not least of which because there is currently no third party EFS component driver. Further, using special tools to reset the user&#x27;s login password will render it impossible to decrypt the user&#x27;s private key and thus useless for gaining access to the user&#x27;s encrypted files. The significance of this is occasionally lost on users, resulting in data loss if a user forgets his or her password, or fails to back up the encryption key. This led to coining of the term &quot;delayed recycle bin&quot;, to describe the seeming inevitability of data loss if an inexperienced user encrypts his or her files.

If EFS is configured to use keys issued by a Public Key Infrastructure and the PKI is configured to enable Key Archival and Recovery, encrypted files can be recovered by recovering the private key first.

<text>WPNT (channel 22) is a television station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Fox affiliate WPGH-TV (channel 53). The two stations share studios on Ivory Avenue in the city&#x27;s Summer Hill section, where WPNT&#x27;s transmitter is also located.

==History==
===Early history of channel 22===
The channel 22 allocation dates back to the 1950s, and was initially acquired by public interest groups as a &quot;backup&quot; plan if the groups were not able to acquire the channel 13 allocation for public television. The groups were in a battle with locally-based Westinghouse Electric Corporation (owners of KDKA radio), who wanted the channel 13 allocation for the proposed KDKA-TV. However, as Westinghouse later gave the groups their blessing to use channel 13 for what would become WQED (Westinghouse bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and transformed that station into KDKA-TV instead), WQED was now stuck with two TV licenses but found use in possibly using channel 22 for educational programs it did not have time to air.

WQED planned to use its proposed WQEX on channel 22, but as fate would have it WENS-TV (channel 16) lost its tower in Reserve Township in a storm on March 11, 1955, leading to a channel sharing agreement with WQED until the tower could be fixed. As WENS-TV was already in a battle for survival competing for the channel 11 license that it would ultimately lose, WQED was able to acquire WENS-TV&#x27;s assets after that station signed off in 1957 and use its construction permit for channel 22 to relaunch WENS-TV as WQEX on channel 16 instead. (That station is now WINP-TV.) Its channel 22 license and some intellectual property from WENS-TV would eventually be sold to the Commercial Radio Institute (which later became Sinclair Broadcast Group) for the current channel 22, outbidding Cornerstone Television, who ended up with the channel 40 license to launch WPCB-TV.

===WPTT-TV===
Rising out of the ashes of WENS-TV, channel 22 finally signed on the air on September 26, 1978, as WPTT-TV (which stood for Pittsburgh Twenty-Two, referencing the UHF channel on which it broadcast), the market&#x27;s second commercial independent station and its fourth UHF station (after WPGH-TV). It started out running a number of popular off-network sitcoms from the 1950s and 1960s, off-network dramas and westerns, very old movies and network programming preempted by WTAE-TV (channel 4), KDKA-TV (channel 2) and WIIC-TV (channel 11, now WPXI). For a time, WPTT-TV aired the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Captain Pitt&quot;, which featured older cartoon shorts.

WPTT-TV also originated more of its own local programming with &quot;Prize Bowling&quot;, which originally began as &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; on ABC network competitor WTAE-TV for many years until host Nick Perry was jailed for a lottery broadcast scam. The succeeding host was not received well by viewers, and the show ended up being canceled. WPTT-TV took the opportunity to fill the void in the market with &quot;Prize Bowling&quot;, first hosted by Pittsburgh radio legend Roger Willoughby-Ray and then by Pittsburgh Steelers announcer Jack Fleming. The show&#x27;s success was modest at best, and was canceled after two years. Other programs of varying degrees of success were &quot;The Ghost Host&quot;, &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot;.

The station also aired a newscast in the early 1980s, a rarity at this time for stations not affiliated with the then-major networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). This newscast was called &quot;WPTT News&quot;, and in the opening segment, the letters &quot;news&quot; were formed from a compass indicating the four cardinal directions. This opening segment, featuring then-anchorman Kevin Evans, appeared briefly (and was audible) in the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot; during a scene where Jennifer Beals&#x27; character returns home and turns on the television. The presentation was relatively low-budget, with the anchor simply reading copy, with no field video shots other than the weather read over a stock video shot denoting the conditions outside, and was not a factor in taking ratings away from then-market laggard WIIC-TV, much less solid runner-up WTAE-TV and then-locally-owned Group W powerhouse KDKA-TV. As sister stations WBFF in Baltimore did not air newscasts until 1991 and WTTE in Columbus, Ohio, would not air any newscasts from its 1984 sign-on until Sinclair purchased ABC affiliate WSYX in 1996, this marked Sinclair&#x27;s first foray into local news, a genre it would become much more involved in from the mid-1990s on.

===The 1980s and early 1990s===
WPGH-TV, which had hitherto been a rather low-budget operation, was purchased by the Meredith Corporation in 1978, and became more aggressive with its programming strategy. Despite having a highly powerful signal that offered double the coverage of WPGH-TV&#x27;s (5 million watts visual, compared to WPGH-TV&#x27;s 2.345 million), WPTT-TV became unable to acquire newer shows, and ended up with programming that no other stations wanted. Still, the shows run on WPTT-TV were not exactly low-budget. The station&#x27;s ratings were very low, and it was considered as an &quot;also-ran&quot; in the market. For many years, WPTT-TV languished as just another local independent station, airing reruns of television shows, many of which were past their prime. In 1986, Sinclair made an offer to buy WPGH-TV, combine programming assets onto Channel 22, keep channel 22, and sell weaker signaled Channel 53 to the Home Shopping Network, but were outbid by Lorimar-Telepictures. After that, WPTT-TV added some more recent shows, cartoons, and movies. By the late 1980s, both WPGH-TV, which was again sold, and WPTT-TV were losing money. WPTT-TV began running Home Shopping Network programming nightly between 1 and 6 a.m.

In 1990, WPTT-TV and Pittsburgh&#x27;s News Corporation (not affiliated with the News Corporation that owned Fox until 2013) entered into an agreement to produce a 10 p.m. newscast to air on WPTT-TV which was to begin in the summer of 1991, and would feature news anchors from WTAE-TV. After going through three owners, WPGH-TV was put up for sale again; Sinclair placed a bid for the station in 1991 and won; however, the group struggled to obtain financing. As part of a deal, the group sold WPTT-TV to its operations manager Eddie Edwards (who had been with WPTT-TV since its launch in 1978, and had become best known as host of the station&#x27;s locally produced public affairs program &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Digest&quot;, targeted towards local African-Americans). Soon after, the planned newscast with WPTT-TV was put on hold with an option to either produce it for WPGH-TV, reinstate the plans with WPTT-TV, or cancel it; it was eventually canceled. WPTT-TV also made a deal to increase Home Shopping Network programming hours to at least 15 hours a day with the option of running the programming the entire day. Rumors abounded that WPTT-TV would be running HSN programming for most of, if not the entire day, once the sale was completed. It was already established that some of WPTT-TV&#x27;s first-run syndicated shows would go to WPGH-TV.

The sales closed on August 29, 1991, with Sinclair acquiring WPGH-TV from Renaissance Broadcasting in the fall of that year. Rights to cash programming from WPTT-TV&#x27;s schedule were moved to WPGH-TV, while barter shows were returned to syndication distributors (it was thought that WPTT-TV might wind up with some low-budget children&#x27;s shows to run a couple hours a day). But Eddie Edwards acquired WPTT-TV without programming and began to run Home Shopping Network programming 24 hours a day on WPTT-TV in September, which led to the station being dropped from the market&#x27;s cable systems. Staffs from both WPGH-TV and WPTT-TV experienced layoffs. Some of WPTT-TV&#x27;s ex-employees went to WPGH-TV while others stayed at WPTT-TV, and many others were laid off. WPGH-TV kept a decent number of its own staff, taking some from both stations. Edwards then made a deal with Sinclair to buy time on his station from 3 p.m. to midnight (effectively creating one of the first local marketing agreements, which Sinclair would use heavily in its later station acquisitions), and get area cable providers to reinstate WPTT-TV on their lineups.

The deal took effect on January 6, 1992, with WPTT-TV airing cartoons, sitcoms, movies and dramas that Sinclair had no room to air on WPGH-TV. Sinclair&#x27;s air time on the station expanded in 1993 to begin at noon. In the fall of 1995, WPTT-TV began to run WPGH-TV programming from 6 a.m. to midnight and picked up The Disney Afternoon cartoon block, which had been dropped by KDKA-TV when that station began running CBS&#x27; entire lineup.

===Network affiliation===

====UPN====
WPTT-TV affiliated with UPN when the network launched on January 16, 1995, and changed its on-air branding to &quot;UPN 22&quot;. Sinclair&#x27;s air time on the station increased later that year to begin at 6 a.m. as well; by 1997, WPTT-TV and WPGH-TV consolidated their operations into one building.

====The WB====
WPTT-TV dropped its UPN affiliation on January 15, 1998 (which moved to WNPA-TV, channel 19) and affiliated with The WB as part of a wide-ranging affiliation deal that saw Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s owned and managed UPN affiliates and independent stations switch to the network. The station also changed its call sign to WCWB (for &quot;C, or See, The WB&quot;) on the 13th, two days before the switch, to reflect its new affiliation. The WCWB calls had previously been used by the NBC affiliate in Macon, Georgia (now WMGT-TV); the WPTT calls were later used by a radio station on 1360 AM in Pittsburgh, which later changed its callsign to WMNY in 2008. Prior to the Sinclair deal, WB programming was available to Pittsburgh on low-power stations WNPA-TV (channel 19) and WBPA-LP (channel 29) and on cable systems via the superstation feed of WGN-TV in Chicago.

Sinclair finally bought back WCWB from Eddie Edwards in 2000, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relaxed its media ownership rules to allow one company to own two television stations in the same market, provided the market has at least eight full-power stations and that one or both stations involved in the duopoly are not among the four highest-rated. WPGH-TV is the senior partner in the duopoly because of its Fox affiliation and because of its longer establishment.

WCWB was airing the Action Pack programming block in 2000.

====MyNetworkTV====
On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that The WB and UPN would be shut down and replaced by The CW, a new network featuring programming from both networks. Through an affiliation agreement with 11 UPN affiliates owned by CBS, UPN owned-and-operated station WNPA was named the Pittsburgh affiliate of The CW, and later changed its call letters to WPCW.

WCWB, meanwhile, later decided to affiliate with MyNetworkTV, another new network owned by News Corporation&#x27;s Fox Entertainment Group and 20th Television divisions. On April 17, WCWB changed its call letters to WPMY to reflect the new affiliation while keeping the &quot;Pittsburgh&#x27;s WB22&quot; until the WB&#x27;s end. On August 14, 2006, WPMY rebranded itself as MyPittsburghTV; the channel 22 reference was excluded from the new brand as cable providers in the market carry WPMY on different channels (the official brand name is &quot;My Pittsburgh TV&quot;, although the logo has it appear to read as &quot;My TV Pittsburgh&quot;). The station withdrew from using their channel number in most promotional forms outside of sign-on/sign-off disclosures for FCC purposes, as the station instead used its Comcast channel 10 for advertising purposes with them and Armstrong Cable having the station in that slot; both systems cover the majority of the Pittsburgh market. Channel 22 officially joined MyNetworkTV when it launched on September 5, 2006. Unlike many other former WB affiliates switching to MyNetworkTV (and despite WNPA being CBS-owned), WPMY continued to air The WB&#x27;s prime time schedule in the late night hours until September 18, 2006, when The CW launched.

===WPNT===
On May 19, 2015, WPMY quietly changed its call letters to WPNT for the landmark &quot;Point&quot; confluence of the Ohio, Allegheny and Monongahela rivers in downtown Pittsburgh, which previously appeared in the market nearly three decades earlier on FM 92.9, now WLTJ. Coincidentally, WLTJ also shares its transmitter facilities with WPGH-TV and WPNT.

On September 1, 2015, WPNT changed its on-air branding to 22 The Point (to further the branding, the station&#x27;s logo utilized an exclamation point). WPNT began to focus more on local programming, particularly sports programming, including a weekly high school football package on Friday nights, while remaining a MyNetworkTV affiliate. No subchannels were planned at the time. As part of the changes, WPNT hired sports personality Mark Madden for a two-hour sports talk show every weeknight and continued to air games from the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, while adding the featured Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Saturday game. Madden&#x27;s program was cancelled on July 1, 2016.

On January 8, 2016, Sinclair announced that American Sports Network would launch as a dedicated, digital multicast network under the American Sports Network name with 10 stations including WPNT on January 11, 2016. However, the station continued to air Duquesne Dukes men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, Penn State Nittany Lions men&#x27;s ice hockey, and the annual Arizona Bowl college football game on the main channel in addition to the ASN subfeed. ASN became Stadium in August 2017 and ceased syndication.

In August 2016, WPNT began to re-air WPGH newscasts produced by WPXI.

Sports programming currently airing on WPNT includes the aforementioned package of high school football games, plus local high school basketball and programming from The CW Sports, including a handful of Pittsburgh Panthers football and basketball games through its contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference.

==== CW affiliation ====
On August 31, 2023, Nexstar Media Group, majority owners of The CW, announced that it extended its affiliation partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group. As part of the deal, it was also announced that WPNT would be taking The CW affiliation effective September 1, with MyNetworkTV moving to late nights, following WPKD-TV going independent. Prior to taking the affiliation full-time, WPNT had already served as a partial affiliate airing CW Sports programming rejected by CBS such as LIV Golf coverage.

==Subchannels==

===ATSC 1.0 subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of two other Pittsburgh TV stations:
Until the end of 2006, WPNT featured The Tube music video channel on a digital subchannel.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPNT ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (the deadline was later extended to June 12). The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, using virtual channel 22. WPNT was one of three stations in the Pittsburgh market to discontinue normal programming on their analog signals on the original signoff date, alongside sister station WPGH-TV and then-WQED-owned WQEX.

As part of the SAFER Act, WPNT and WPGH kept their analog signals on the air until March 19 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse===


On June 16, 2020, WPNT discontinued ATSC 1.0 broadcasting and became one of the first stations in the country (and the first in the northeast United States) to begin broadcasting in ATSC 3.0. The signal includes T2, a FAST spinoff of Sinclair-owned Tennis Channel mapped at 53.10 and unique to the ATSC 3.0 signal.

<text>WGWG (channel 4) is a television station in Charleston, South Carolina, United States, affiliated with the multicast network MeTV. The station is owned by Howard Stirk Holdings. WGWG&#x27;s transmitter is located near Awendaw, South Carolina.

From 1962 through 2014, what is now WGWG was the original home of WCIV, and had been Charleston&#x27;s ABC affiliate since 1996; however, in August 2014, WCIV owner Allbritton Communications was acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of MyNetworkTV affiliate WMMP (channel 36) and operator of Fox affiliate WTAT-TV (channel 24, owned by Cunningham Broadcasting). Due to ownership conflicts with WMMP and WTAT, and a recent crackdown on joint sales agreements by the FCC, Sinclair elected to sell the WCIV channel 4 license to Howard Stirk Holdings, and moved WCIV&#x27;s ABC programming and news operation to a subchannel of WMMP&#x27;s channel 36 signal. At the same time, the two stations also switched call signs, with WCIV moving to channel 36 and channel 4 becoming the new WMMP, though the MyNetworkTV affiliation remains on channel 36.1 and did not move to channel 4.

The FCC approved HSH Charleston&#x27;s purchase of channel 4 on December 4, 2014; the call letters became WGWG on March 11, 2015. Howard Stirk Holdings operates WGWG independently of WCIV and WTAT, and has not entered into a local marketing agreement with Sinclair.

==History==
WGWG began operations on October 23, 1962, as WCIV, the third commercial outlet in Charleston. The original license was granted to WTMA-TV but the call letters were later changed to WCIV before it signed on. It took the NBC affiliation from WCBD-TV (known as WUSN-TV at the time), leaving that station to become a full-time ABC affiliate. The station was originally owned by the Washington Star Company. In 1976, businessman Joe Allbritton bought the &quot;Star&quot; and sold off the non-television assets in 1978 to form Allbritton Communications.

In May 1994, Birmingham ABC affiliate WBRC was sold to New World Communications, which signed an affiliation agreement with eleven other stations which would become Fox affiliates. WBRC, along with Piedmont Triad ABC affiliate WGHP, were placed in a blind trust in the fall of 1994, as the FCC prohibited a company from owning more than twelve television stations at the time. Both stations were sold to Fox directly in July 1995, but Fox was forced to run WBRC as an ABC affiliate for over a year after the sale, as WBRC&#x27;s affiliation contract with ABC did not expire until August 1996. Before WBRC became a Fox owned-and-operated station, Allbritton purchased WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV, and made them full power satellites of WBMA-LP; this prompted Allbritton to sign a groupwide affiliation deal with ABC which caused WCIV and Brunswick sister station WBSG-TV (now Ion Television O&amp;O WPXC-TV) to become ABC affiliates. The latter had joined ABC as a semi-satellite of WJXX, which replaced WJKS as Jacksonville&#x27;s ABC affiliate upon its 1997 sign-on). WCIV became an ABC affiliate on August 19, 1996; the NBC affiliation subsequently returned to WCBD on that day. The last NBC program to air on WCIV was an &quot;NBC Sunday Night Movie&quot; presentation of &quot;A Friend to Die For&quot; at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on August 18, while the first ABC program to air on the station was &quot;Good Morning America&quot; at 7 a.m. Eastern Time on August 19.

===Sale to Howard Stirk Holdings; ABC and MeTV move to channel 36===
On July 29, 2013, Allbritton Communications announced that it would sell its entire television group, including WCIV, to Sinclair. As part of the deal, Sinclair was planning to sell the license assets of WMMP to Howard Stirk Holdings (owned by conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams), but would still operate the station through shared services and joint sales agreements. However, in December 2013, FCC Video Division Chief Barbara Kreisman ruled that &quot;the proposed transactions would result in the elimination of the grandfathered status of certain local marketing agreements and thus cause the transactions to violate our local TV ownership rules.&quot;

While Sinclair attempted to sell WMMP and planned to terminate an SSA with the Cunningham-owned Fox affiliate WTAT, as well as foregoing any operational or financial agreements with the buyers of the stations being sold to other parties, on May 29, 2014, Sinclair informed the FCC that it had not found a buyer for WMMP and proposed surrendering the WCIV broadcast license; through the use of multicasting, WMMP would both carry its existing programming and inherit WCIV&#x27;s ABC affiliation, syndicated programming, and news operation. Sinclair opted to retain WMMP because its facilities are superior to those of WCIV. However, following the closure of the Allbritton deal, Sinclair reached a deal to sell WCIV&#x27;s license to Howard Stirk Holdings, and offer it studio space at WMMP&#x27;s existing facilities.

The transition process began on September 25, 2014, as a simulcast of WCIV was added to WMMP&#x27;s second subchannel, along with MeTV on 36.3 (replacing ZUUS Country on that channel), and MyTV Charleston remaining on 36.1. The two stations then swapped licenses four days later; WCIV&#x27;s call sign was moved to the WMMP license and virtual channel 36, while WMMP&#x27;s call sign was moved to the WCIV license which will be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings. The original WCIV signal went silent on September 30, 2014, making ABC exclusive to WCIV-DT2. As of October 8, channel 4 returned to the air with programming from the ZUUS Country network, which had displaced on 36.3 by WCIV&#x27;s former DT2 affiliation, MeTV. On March 11, 2015, WMMP changed its call letters to WGWG.

On August 1, 2015, the station switched its primary affiliation to Heroes &amp; Icons. On August 2, 2016, the station launched its 4.2 subchannel, affiliated with Decades. On September 12, 2022, the station switched its primary affiliation to MeTV, with Heroes &amp; Icons moving to the fifth subchannel. This marked the first time MeTV aired on WGWG since 2014, when the network moved to WCIV-DT3. That subchannel switched to Stadium.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Charleston television stations:
In exchange, the market&#x27;s main commercial stations are broadcast in ATSC 3.0 on this multiplex:


On October 1, 2011, WCIV added MeTV on digital subchannel 4.2, replacing The Local AccuWeather Channel. With the transition to WMMP, 4.2&#x27;s signal moved to 36.3.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WGWG (as WCIV) shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 4.

<text>WZTV (channel 17) is a television station in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, affiliated with Fox and The CW. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate WUXP-TV (channel 30) as well as WNAB (channel 58), which Sinclair manages on behalf of Tennessee Broadcasting. The stations share studios on Mainstream Drive along the Cumberland River; WZTV&#x27;s transmitter is located along I-24 in Whites Creek.

Channel 17 in Nashville was first activated in August 1968 as WMCV, owned by local consortium Music City Video. It was the first ultra high frequency (UHF) station in Nashville and its first independent station, but it was unable to sustain itself financially and left the air in March 1971. Two years later, it was sold at bankruptcy auction to radio executive Bob Hudson, who attempted to return channel 17 to air as WTLT. Had Hudson been able to resume service, channel 17 would have been the first Black-owned television station in the United States. However, an economic downturn prevented him from raising sufficient capital to begin operations, and it fell to Reel Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Robert K. Zelle, to put the station back on air as WZTV in March 1976. In 1980, Zelle sold WZTV to Multimedia, Inc., which used Nashville as a base to distribute country music-related TV series. WZTV also remained the market&#x27;s leading independent despite competition from two new startups in the decade.

Act III Broadcasting acquired WZTV in 1988 and purchased the Fox affiliation for the Nashville market in 1990, moving it from WCAY-TV (channel 30), where it had been since the network&#x27;s inception. Act III was purchased in 1995 and became Sullivan Broadcasting, during which time the station began airing a local newscast for the first time. Sinclair purchased the Sullivan stations, including WZTV, in 1998 and has continued to expand the station&#x27;s local news programming. The CW programming moved to a subchannel of WZTV from WNAB in 2021.

==History==
===WMCV===
On January 25, 1966, Music City Video, Inc., a consortium of local investors with connections to several local radio stations, applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit to build a new TV station on channel 24 in Nashville. The application was spearheaded by Alven S. Ghertner, who proposed to build studios on land he owned that was occupied by a service station. At the time, Nashville had no independent station, nor did it have any stations in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band; the Music City Video station was intended to fill both voids with a heavy emphasis on live programming The FCC granted the permit application on July 7, 1966, by which time channel 24 had been switched to channel 17 because of a national overhaul of the UHF table of allocations.

WMCV was not built for another two years. In 1968, however, activity increased with the construction of studios and a transmitter facility on 38th Avenue North. There had been turnover in investors in the intervening years, with new investors including congressman Richard Fulton and secretary of state Joe C. Carr, but the station continued to promise a series of new local programs, including a dance show and professional wrestling produced in the studios. The station began broadcasting on August 5. WMCV owned a mobile production unit, the &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot;, which allowed it to produce the first regular local telecasts of high school basketball games. Channel 17 also brought viewers such local programs as auto racing from the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway, interviews with visiting celebrity athletes on &quot;Celebrities and Sports&quot;, the first regular coverage of Tennessee State University and Fisk University sports, and all-night movies.

However, two and a half years after WMCV began telecasting, Music City Video entered into financial difficulties. It announced it would leave the air on March 14, 1971, for what it hoped would be a period of no longer than 90 days to reorganize or find new investors. Instead of finding new investors and returning to the air, it filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1971 and was adjudicated bankrupt in January 1973. A receiver was appointed and became the licensee.

===The &quot;Total Local Television&quot; that wasn&#x27;t===
On July 9, 1973, a bankruptcy court approved the sale of the WMCV license and some office furniture to the Hudson Broadcasting Corporation, a company owned by local radio executive Bob Hudson. The purchase held the prospect of ensuring the station&#x27;s place in television history; if he put WMCV back on the air, it would be the first Black-owned television station in the United States. While Hudson promised to return channel 17 to use by January 1974 and later by June, the FCC did not approve the transaction until July 31, 1974, conditioning approval on a return to service within 90 days.

The call letters on the permit were changed to WTLT, for &quot;Total Local Television&quot;, on September 6. Hudson had previously promised that the station would serve the entire community with a special emphasis on minority issues and also on training minorities for careers in broadcasting, later describing his program lineup as &quot;60 percent Black-oriented, 40 percent other&quot;. Work also began on updating equipment, with color cameras being ordered to replace the black-and-white units that WMCV used. The studio also needed attention; when Hudson&#x27;s team first entered, they found cigar and cigarette butts on the floor, coffee cups untouched since 1971, and a half-opened letter.

Hudson&#x27;s dream, however, ran into unexpected trouble. WTLT was able to broadcast test patterns in February 1975, and programming and staff had been secured, but Hudson Broadcasting was unable to assemble the capital necessary to begin full-time operations of the station, owing to an ongoing recession, high interest rates, and the unwillingness of banks to support a new speculative television venture. In July 1975, the entire facility was put up for sale, with Bob Hudson telling &quot;The Tennessean&quot; that his firm was &quot;in the right place at the wrong time&quot;.

===WZTV: The independent years===
Hudson Broadcasting announced the sale of WTLT to Reel Broadcasting Corporation, a company headed by Robert K. Zelle, in August 1975. The FCC granted approval on September 30, and the sale closed in early November, with new WZTV call letters selected nearly immediately. After months of construction and equipment delays, WZTV began broadcasting again on March 6, 1976. The program lineup included several professional and college sports packages, syndicated shows, and movies. The first program aired was a local show, a game show titled &quot;Beat the Bidders&quot; and taped at Opryland USA. Equally noteworthy was its executive team, which included Michael Thompson—later an owner of independent television stations in Tennessee—as vice president and station manager and general manager Ian &quot;Sandy&quot; Wheeler, who would later start Family Group Broadcasting.

In December 1978, Reel Broadcasting agreed to sell WZTV to Multimedia, Inc., whose television station holdings consisted of network affiliates in the Midwest and South. While WZTV would be the group&#x27;s only independent, it would be part of a larger Multimedia operation in the city. The company published the monthly &quot;Music City News&quot;, covering Nashville&#x27;s country music industry, and it was interested in building a Nashville presence for the production and syndication of country music TV programs. The $7 million sale was not approved until January 1980 and completed in March.

Multimedia&#x27;s ownership tenure was one for growth for the station. By 1982, the company was attempting to secure additional space for WZTV&#x27;s operations beyond the increasingly cramped 38th Avenue North plant; as a temporary move, administrative and sales staff were moved into a downtown office building in the MetroCenter area. In addition, the station improved its technical facilities by agreeing to lease space on WSMV-TV&#x27;s tower. WZTV was also the television home of Nashville Sounds baseball from 1982 to 1991, and from 1986 to 1989 and again in 1991, it was the television home of Vanderbilt Commodores football.

At the same time, a market in which WZTV had been the only independent station suddenly turned competitive. In the span of four months, WFYZ (channel 39) started from Murfreesboro on December 30, 1983, and WCAY-TV (channel 30), owned by TVX Broadcast Group, debuted on February 18, 1984. WFYZ was purchased by Hudson and renamed WHTN in 1985, but it lost money, went off the air in April 1986, and returned the next month in the process of being sold to the Christian Television Network.

In 1987, Multimedia announced a commitment to build a new facility in MetroCenter that would end the split of its staff between two offices. By 1988, Multimedia&#x27;s Nashville-based entertainment division was producing and syndicating the Music City News Awards telecast from the Grand Ole Opry and Christmas specials with the Statler Brothers.

In 1988, Multimedia sold WZTV to Act III Broadcasting, a company owned by Norman Lear. The sale moved WZTV from Multimedia, which owned no other independents, to a broadcasting company that specialized in running such stations. The sale included WZTV as well as the Nashville division of Multimedia, an archive of 4,000 programs, and Multimedia&#x27;s music publishing business; Act III described WZTV as its &quot;flagship station&quot; after the purchase. Most of the program archive, consisting of programs produced between 1968 and 1982 by Showbiz Productions, was sold to Willie Nelson the next year for a proposed cable channel, The Cowboy Network. Act III also completed the relocation to the Mainstream site in early 1989.

Meanwhile, in 1986, WCAY-TV had affiliated with the newly launched Fox network. However, the station initially did not get a substantial ratings boost and continued to trail WZTV in the ratings. Two years later, WCAY was purchased by MT Communications—the MT standing for the same Michael Thompson that had been WZTV&#x27;s vice president in 1976—and became WXMT in 1989. However, WXMT&#x27;s Fox affiliation agreement contained a clause allowing the network to review its affiliation after one year of the station being sold. As Fox was known to prefer to affiliate with the top-rated independent in a market, speculation arose as to how long WXMT could maintain the Fox affiliation in Nashville. It was also becoming apparent that the Nashville market was not large enough for what were essentially two directly competing independent stations—at the time, Fox stations were still generally considered independents. Additionally, Act III openly coveted the Fox affiliation. Act III vice president Bert Ellis stated in 1989 that &quot;we bought ZTV figuring it would eventually get a Fox affiliation&quot;, even though Fox&#x27;s vice president of affiliate relations for the central region characterized such a move as &quot;very unlikely&quot;.

===As a Fox affiliate===
On February 6, 1990, after negotiations that had been in progress for a week, Act III acquired the Nashville Fox affiliation and the vast majority of WXMT&#x27;s programming inventory from MT Communications. With immediate effect, Fox programming, &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, Cincinnati Reds baseball, and syndicated programs including &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; moved to WZTV; WXMT maintained some children&#x27;s programs and filled much of its air time with the Home Shopping Network. The deal also made Act III the largest owner of Fox affiliates in the United States, with seven. Nashville became the first of four markets, all in the South, where Fox moved its affiliation during 1990; of the other three, two (Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis) involved ex-TVX stations. It also became the third city in which Act III purchased much of another station&#x27;s programming inventory, having previously done so at stations in Richmond, Virginia, and Buffalo, New York. Less than a year earlier, in July 1989, MT Communications had offered to purchase WZTV&#x27;s programming inventory, a deal that fell apart late in negotiations.

WZTV was almost the victim of an affiliation switch in 1994. New World Communications, a company looking to acquire WSMV-TV, agreed on May 23, 1994, to affiliate most of its stations with Fox, setting off what turned into a multi-year national affiliation realignment. WZTV would have had to find a new affiliation, such as NBC, which Fox would have displaced on WSMV-TV. New World continued to negotiate to acquire WSMV-TV, but despite being described as a near-done deal, talks fell apart, leaving the affiliation status quo in place in Nashville.

In 1995, Act III was acquired by ABRY Broadcast Partners; the Boston buyout firm named Dan Sullivan, president of the TV division of Clear Channel Communications, to run Sullivan Broadcasting, a joint venture with ABRY to manage the former Act III portfolio. The next year, Sullivan Broadcasting entered into a local marketing agreement—with an option to buy—to run most of the operations of WXMT, by then a UPN affiliate (renamed WUXP-TV later that year), concurrent with Mission Broadcasting acquiring WXMT&#x27;s license assets. In addition, under Sullivan, WZTV began airing its first local newscast.

In 1998, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired Sullivan Broadcasting, including WZTV and its agreement to manage WUXP-TV. The deal made the company the largest owner of Fox affiliates outside of the network.

On September 20, 2021, WZTV&#x27;s second digital subchannel became Nashville&#x27;s affiliate of The CW, inheriting the programming that had been on Sinclair-managed WNAB.

===News operation===

In the 1990s, Fox began to encourage its affiliates to develop local news programs. In response, in 1997, WZTV began hiring anchors and reporters to produce a 9 p.m. newscast in collaboration with Nashville ABC affiliate WKRN-TV. WKRN-TV would not produce the newscast, but it did provide studio space, equipment, and some news stories. &quot;Fox News @ Nine&quot; began airing on July 7, 1997; notable among the initial hires was news anchor Ashley Webster, later of the Fox Business Network. It was the first full newscast in the time slot in Nashville since the WSMV-produced &quot;The Scene at 9&quot; aired on WXMT from 1992 to 1994. Weekend newscasts were initially not included in the agreement, but six months later, on January 4, 1998, the station began airing Sunday night newscasts in response to the popularity of lead-in &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

The program remained a half-hour in length until July 6, 2000, when WZTV brought news production in-house and expanded it to an hour. Sinclair invested $3 million and increased WZTV&#x27;s own news staff from six to 43 people.

In 2002, WZTV expanded its local programming with a new, entertainment-oriented morning show, originally titled &quot;Tennessee Mornings&quot;; the program became a radio simulcast with WLAC in 2004 and expanded to two hours. By 2013, when the program was relaunched and retitled &quot;Fox 17 This Morning&quot;, it had grown to four hours. A 4:30 a.m. half-hour was added in 2014 alongside a 5:30 p.m. newscast competing against network newscasts on the ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates.

===Sports programming===
In 2003, WZTV began producing and airing &quot;Titans All Access&quot;, a weekly half-hour program during football season covering the activities of the Tennessee Titans.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WZTV hosts a subchannel of WUXP-TV as part of the ATSC 3.0 deployment plan for Nashville, in which WUXP-TV and WNAB broadcast several local stations (including WZTV) in 3.0 format.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WZTV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17, on February 17, 2009, which was intended to be the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The deadline was moved to June 12, 2009, but the station decided to convert on the original deadline. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 15, using virtual channel 17.

<text>WUXP-TV (channel 30) is a television station in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside WZTV (channel 17), a dual affiliate of Fox and The CW, as well as WNAB (channel 58), which Sinclair manages on behalf of Tennessee Broadcasting. The stations share studios on Mainstream Drive along the Cumberland River; WUXP-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located along I-24 in Whites Creek.

Channel 30 in Nashville began broadcasting in February 1984 as WCAY-TV. Built by the TVX Broadcast Group, the station competed as Nashville&#x27;s second independent outlet with WZTV for most of the 1980s. It was the Fox affiliate in Nashville from 1986 to 1990 before selling most of its programming inventory to WZTV amid a competitive market. Renamed WXMT in 1989 after being purchased by MT Communications, the station remained the second independent in Nashville and affiliated with UPN in 1995. WZTV began managing channel 30&#x27;s operations in 1996, a year in which the license was sold and the station renamed WUXP-TV. Sinclair assumed control of the station in 1998, when it acquired WZTV, and purchased it outright in 2000; when UPN folded in 2006, the station switched to MyNetworkTV. WUXP-TV and WNAB are Nashville&#x27;s two ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) stations.

==History==
===The TVX years===
In November 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated 13 competing applications for UHF channel 30 in Nashville for comparative hearing. The very large field featured names well-known in other cities, including Carolina Christian Broadcasting, Golden West Broadcasters, and American Television and Communications (the cable TV division of Time, Inc.). By January 1982, only five of the applicants were still seeking for the construction permit: Television Corporation of Tennessee, a company headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, in which mayor Richard Fulton became a minority investor; Music City Thirty, owned primarily by Methodists; Satellite Broadcasting Systems of Tulsa, Oklahoma; Nash Broadcasting; and Page Broadcasting.

The FCC granted the construction permit to Television Corporation (TVX, later known simply as TVX Broadcast Group) in August 1983. By that time, the call letters of WCAY-TV had been selected, as had a tower site. Meanwhile, the Nashville market—already having WZTV, an independent in service since 1976—gained a second independent station with the launch of WFYZ in Murfreesboro on December 31. What was once a mid-April launch target moved up to February as TVX signed for studio space at Third Avenue South and Peabody Street.

WCAY-TV began broadcasting on February 18, 1984. It immediately entered into a money-losing competition with WFYZ; however, TVX outlasted the Murfreesboro station, with its limited financial resources. In September 1984, WFYZ executed the first of several rounds of cutbacks. That station, sold and renamed WHTN in 1985, exited the battle by converting to a Christian format in May 1986.

In January 1986, TVX—already having relegated WHTN to the status, per company chairman J. Timothy McDonald, of showing &quot;freebies no one else wants&quot;—refocused its attack on WZTV, Nashville&#x27;s leading independent. While TVX&#x27;s independents had mostly risen to lead their markets, WCAY-TV was the exception. The station became affiliated that fall with the new Fox network, but TVX continued to need to devote additional attention to improving channel 30&#x27;s ratings against WZTV, hiring new management and increasing its promotional efforts.

Despite the fact that WCAY-TV was not TVX&#x27;s most successful station, the company expressed its resolve to stick with the Nashville market. However, financial circumstances combined to change that policy. In 1987, TVX acquired five major-market independent stations from Taft Broadcasting. This purchase left TVX highly leveraged and highly vulnerable. TVX&#x27;s bankers, Salomon Brothers, provided the financing for the acquisition and in return held more than 60 percent of the company. The company was to pay Salomon Brothers $200 million on January 1, 1988, and missed the first payment deadline, having been unable to lure investors to its junk bonds even before Black Monday. As a result, TVX sought buyers for some of its smaller stations to reduce its debt load. That May, TVX announced the sale of WCAY-TV to SouthWest MultiMedia Corporation of Houston for $6 million. However, this deal fell apart over the intervening months.

===MT Communications ownership===
In the wake of the SouthWest MultiMedia sale effort stalling, TVX found another buyer for WCAY-TV: MT Communications, the company of Michael Thompson. Thompson already had a history with independent television in Nashville; he had been one of WZTV&#x27;s executives when it went back on the air in 1976. The call letters were changed to WXMT in October 1989 as part of the insertion of &quot;MT&quot; into the call signs of its stations.

MT Communications assumed the challenge TVX had faced in its entire history running channel 30: passing WZTV in the ratings. As MT was buying WCAY-TV, Act III Broadcasting acquired WZTV. Act III would make a reputation as a consolidator of independents in medium markets. In 1988, Act III simultaneously acquired Richmond, Virginia, independent WRLH-TV and the programming of competitor WVRN-TV, incorporating the latter&#x27;s programming and physical assets into the former as the latter went off the air permanently. The next year, it agreed to acquire WUTV in Buffalo, New York, along with the programming inventory of competitor WNYB-TV, which then was sold to a Christian broadcaster; the deal was not completed until June 1990 owing to ownership complications in the market. Act III clearly coveted the Fox affiliation of WXMT; vice president Bert Ellis stated in 1989 that &quot;we bought ZTV figuring it would eventually get a Fox affiliation&quot;, even though Fox&#x27;s vice president of affiliate relations for the central region characterized such a move as &quot;very unlikely&quot;.

Two factors worked in favor of Act III. The Nashville market was not large enough at the time to support what were essentially two competing independents; like most early Fox affiliates, WXMT was mostly programmed as an independent. Additionally, Fox had a clause in its TVX affiliation agreements, inherited by MT Communications, that allowed it to review its affiliation status after one year of the station being sold. Fox was known to prefer to affiliate with the top-rated independent in a market, and speculation arose as to how long WXMT could maintain the Fox affiliation in Nashville. Negotiations began in 1989, originally with the intent that WXMT buy WZTV&#x27;s inventory, but that deal fell apart. On February 6, 1990, after negotiations that had been in progress for a week, Act III acquired the Fox affiliation and the vast majority of WXMT&#x27;s programming inventory from MT Communications. With immediate effect, Fox programming, &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, Cincinnati Reds baseball, and syndicated programs including &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; moved to WZTV; WXMT, which was initially to surrender all of its programming inventory, maintained some children&#x27;s programs and filled much of its air time with the Home Shopping Network. Nashville became the first of four markets, all in the South, where Fox moved its affiliation during 1990; of the other three, two (Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis) involved ex-TVX stations, with the Memphis station losing its Fox affiliation also owned by MT.

In the subsequent years, WXMT rebuilt itself. From 1992 to 1994, it aired &quot;The Scene at 9&quot;, a prime time newscast produced by Nashville NBC affiliate WSMV-TV and the first such broadcast in the market. The station made an early commitment to the United Paramount Network (UPN), signing on to become an affiliate in November 1993—more than a year before it began programming in 1995.

===Sullivan and Sinclair management===
In 1996, Sullivan Broadcasting, which had purchased WZTV from Act III the year prior, entered into a local marketing agreement—with an option to buy—to run most of the operations of WXMT, concurrent with Mission Broadcasting acquiring WXMT&#x27;s license assets. The call letters were changed that August to WUXP-TV, reflecting the UPN affiliation. In 1998, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired Sullivan Broadcasting, including WZTV and its agreement to manage WUXP-TV. In 1998, Sinclair announced its intent to purchase Sullivan outright; the LMA with WUXP was included in the deal. Two years later, after the FCC legalized outright duopolies, Sinclair acquired WUXP-TV from Mission as well as three other stations it had been programming. Sinclair began managing WNAB (channel 58) in 2002.

In 2006, UPN and The WB merged to form The CW. Sinclair was first a partner of MyNetworkTV, and WUXP was signed as its Nashville affiliate in early March, shortly after MyNetworkTV was announced in late February. Two months later, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement covering eight markets with The CW in May; this included WNAB.

==Local programming==
===News and public affairs===
WUXP-TV airs &quot;Comments with Dr. Haney&quot;, a local interview program featuring retired Tennessee State University professor Dr. James Haney, on Saturday mornings. The station has no dedicated newscasts but does air morning and late evening blocks of The National Desk, Sinclair&#x27;s national news service.

===Sports===
WUXP-TV began airing a &quot;Thursday Night Lights&quot; package of local high school football games in 2008. This expanded to include weekly high school basketball telecasts in 2014; that same year, the football package shifted to Fridays under the label &quot;Friday Night Rivals&quot;. In 2013, WUXP-TV began airing the state championship football games of the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) as part of a statewide network.

From 2018 to 2022, spanning the team&#x27;s shift from the United Soccer League to Major League Soccer, WUXP-TV was the primary broadcaster of Nashville SC matches, an arrangement that only ended when Apple assumed all local and national television rights in MLS.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Nashville television stations:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUXP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on February 17, 2009, which was intended to be the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The deadline was moved to June 12, 2009, but WUXP decided to convert on the original deadline. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 21, using virtual channel 30.

<text>WNAB (channel 58) is a television station in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, affiliated with the digital multicast network Dabl. It is owned by Tennessee Broadcasting, which maintains an outsourcing agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of WZTV (channel 17) and WUXP-TV (channel 30), for the provision of certain services. The stations share studios on Mainstream Drive along the Cumberland River; WNAB&#x27;s transmitter is located along I-24 in Whites Creek.

==History==
===As a WB affiliate===
In 1987, Ruth Payne Carman was awarded a construction permit to build a new television station on channel 58 in Nashville, which took the call letters WNAB. It would be another eight years before it began broadcasting on November 29, 1995, as the WB affiliate for the Nashville market. Prior to WNAB&#x27;s debut, WB programming was only available on Nashville area cable and satellite providers either through Chicago-based national superstation WGN, or by Cookeville-based WKZX (channel 28, now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WNPX-TV), which served the eastern part of the market. Three months after launching the station, Speer Communications, a company founded by Home Shopping Network co-founder Roy Speer; it was from Speer&#x27;s studios in a former Sam&#x27;s Club building on Dickerson Road in Nashville that the station had launched.

Offering five hours of live, locally produced programming each weekday, WNAB was quickly a hit among Nashville viewers, although the station lacked cable carriage in many of the suburbs. Controversial former Nashville mayor and U.S. congressman Bill Boner hosted an hour-long interview/call-in show, &quot;Prime Talk&quot; each weeknight. Its follow-up, &quot;Sports Talk&quot;, featured &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; sportswriter Greg Pogue and popular radio personality George Plaster showing highlights and taking calls about the day&#x27;s sports action. On Friday nights in the fall, &quot;Sports Talk&quot; was extended by an hour and became Nashville&#x27;s first television show entirely devoted to high school football scores. Since the 1996 season, at least one of Nashville&#x27;s television stations has continued this tradition. Overnight, WNAB also carried MOR Music TV, a Speer-owned home shopping/music network that had moved from St. Petersburg, Florida, to the Nashville facility.

In September 1996, all live programming except &quot;Sports Talk&quot; was cancelled (partly due to budget constraints, and also due to The WB expanding its prime time lineup to additional nights outside of the initial Sunday and Wednesday slots). Plaster left &quot;Sports Talk&quot;; it was rebranded as &quot;Sports Plus&quot; and featured news and weather segments in addition to its sports content before being cancelled in 1998. WNAB also aired several Nashville Predators games when the NHL team made its debut during the 1998–99 season, and split time as the television flagship alongside regional cable sports network Fox Sports South (now Bally Sports South) until the end of the 1999–2000 season.

Speer Communications had planned to use WNAB and its Dickerson Road facility as a base of operations for Tennessee Now, a 24-hour cable news channel covering the entire state. However, by 1996, plans for Tennessee Now had been shelved. Speer would sell WNAB in 1998 to Tennessee Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Beverly Hills, California-based Lambert Broadcasting, LLC. Four years later, citing the downturn in the advertising market of the time and continued losses at WNAB, Lambert outsourced its advertising sales and operations to the Sinclair Broadcast Group.

On August 3, 2002, WNAB&#x27;s transmitting facilities were relocated from its original Nolensville tower to its present transmitter near Whites Creek near the Interstate 24 interchange with Old Hickory Boulevard (State Highway 45).

===As a CW/Dabl affiliate===

On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would partner to launch The CW Television Network, as a replacement for The WB and UPN, initially featuring a mix of programs carried over from those two networks and newer series. Sinclair later signed WNAB as the market&#x27;s affiliate of the network, as part of a wider deal to affiliate its WB affiliates and independent stations with The CW. The CW launched, with WNAB as its Nashville station, on September 18, 2006.

On July 28, 2021, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order stemming from a lawsuit against WNAB owner Tennessee Broadcasting. The lawsuit, filed by AT&amp;T, alleged that Tennessee Broadcasting failed to negotiate for retransmission consent in good faith for WNAB. Owners of other Sinclair-managed stations, such as Deerfield Media, were also named in the lawsuit. Tennessee Broadcasting was ordered to pay a fine of $512,228.

On September 14, 2021, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that Nashville&#x27;s CW affiliation would move from WNAB to WZTV&#x27;s 17.2 subchannel beginning September 20 at 10 am. On that day, the main channel switched to broadcasting the Dabl digital multicast television network.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signal of CBS affiliate WTVF:

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse service===


===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WNAB shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 58, on February 17, 2009, which was intended to be the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The deadline was moved to June 12, 2009, but the station decided to convert on the original deadline. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 58.

<doc id="628414" wikidata="Q316288" url="?curid=628414" title="Mariano Rumor">
<text>Mariano Rumor ( ;16 June 1915 – 22 January 1990) was an Italian politician and statesman. A member of the Christian Democracy (DC), he served as the 39th prime minister of Italy from December 1968 to August 1970 and again from July 1973 to November 1974. As prime minister, he led five different governments, supported by various coalitions.

Rumor served as Italian Minister of Agriculture from 1959 to 1963, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1974 to 1976, and Italian Minister of the Interior in two brief periods, in 1963 and from 1972 to 1973. Rumor was the secretary of the DC from 1964 to 1969.

==Early life and career==
Mariano Rumor was born in Vicenza, Veneto, on 16 June 1915. His father, Giuseppe Rumor, was the owner of a printing studio and promoter of a local magazine, &quot;The Catholic Worker&quot; founded by Rumor&#x27;s grandfather. His mother, Tina Nardi, came from a liberal family. He attended the classical lyceum Antonio Pigafetta in Vicenza, then he earned a degree from the University of Padua in literature in 1939.

After his graduation, Rumor became a teacher at an Italian lyceum until his mobilization as a lieutenant in the Italian Army during the Second World War. Subsequent to the Armistice of Cassibile in 1943 between Italy and the Allied powers, Rumor joined the Italian resistance movement. After the end of the war, he was among the founders of the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI), the widespread lay Catholic associations, and joined the Christian Democracy (DC) party, of which he became one of the main leaders in Veneto, very close to Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi. In the 1946 election, Rumor was elected with more than 29,000 votes to the Constituent Assembly, for the constituency of Verona–Padova–Vicenza–Rovigo.

He became a member of the new-born Chamber of Deputies in 1948. The 1948 elections were heavily influenced by the Cold War confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and are now best known for the covert political warfare waged by the US State Department and Central Intelligence Agency on behalf of the DC. The elections were eventually won with a comfortable margin by De Gasperi&#x27;s DC that defeated the left-wing coalition of the Popular Democratic Front, that comprised the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). As a deputy he became very close to Giuseppe Dossetti, becoming a member of his Christian leftist wing.

==Political career==
===First roles in government===

In 1950, Guido Gonella succeeded Paolo Emilio Taviani as National Secretary of the DC; the target of the new secretariat was to build a unitary management of the party in support of the government led by Alcide De Gasperi. In this context, Rumor was nominated for the first time as National Deputy Secretary, together with Dossetti.

The withdrawal from politics of Giuseppe Dossetti, left his faction without a charismatic leader; however, Mariano Rumor played a decisive role in the birth of the new faction, called &quot;Democratic Initiative&quot;, which brought together not only Dossetti&#x27;s followers, such as Giorgio La Pira, Amintore Fanfani and Aldo Moro, but also members of the centrist pro-De Gasperi majority, as Paolo Emilio Taviani and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Rumor himself presented the manifesto of Democratic Initiative, published on a magazine with the same name. In this text, alongside the declaration of support for De Gasperi and the Atlantic Pact, Dossetti&#x27;s principles of a Christian reformist party were reaffirmed, with the aim of moving the country towards a &quot;democratic evolution&quot;.

Rumor immediately played a leading role in the faction. This position, led him to hold the first government posts, becoming Undersecretary for Agriculture in De Gasperi&#x27;s seventh government, a position he also maintained in De Gasperi VIII Cabinet and, after De Gasperi&#x27;s retirement in 1954, in the short-lived government led by Giuseppe Pella. In the brief first Fanfani government, from January to February 1954, Rumor was appointed to Secretary of the Council of Ministers.
In 1954, after the National Congress of Naples, which saw the affirmation of Democratic Initiative and the subsequent election of Fanfani as party&#x27;s Secretary, Rumor was elected again deputy secretary. He held this office for the next five years, until Democratic Initiative split up. In fact, many members of the faction, started criticizing the political line of Fanfani&#x27;s secretariat, who cautiously began to open to the prospect of a collaboration with Italian Socialist Party (PSI). Prominent members of the faction, including Rumor himself, put the Secretary in minority during the National Congress of March 1959. In this way, Democratic Initiative split up between the followers of Fanfani and the dissident group, now renamed by all &quot;Dorotei&quot; (&quot;Dorotheans&quot;), from the place where they had gathered before the congress, the convent of the sisters of Santa Dorotea in Rome. The new faction was built around Antonio Segni, Mariano Rumor and Aldo Moro, who was elected new Secretary.

In the same year, as one of the faction&#x27;s leaders, Rumor was appointed Minister of Agriculture, in the second Segni&#x27;s government, a position he would keep in the governments of Fernando Tambroni, and Fanfani. In this role, Rumor contributed to the definition of one of the first plans for the development and innovation of the national agricultural sector, the so-called &quot;Green Plan&quot;.
In 1963 election, the DC suffered a sharp decline of consensus. Rumor was appointed Minister of the Interior in the short-lived government chaired by Giovanni Leone.

As minister, he had to face one of the most tragic events in Italian republican history, the Vajont Dam disaster. On 9 October 1963, a landslide occurred on Monte Toc, in the province of Pordenone. The landslide caused a megatsunami in the artificial lake in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths. In the previous months, the Adriatic Society of Electricity (SADE) and the Italian government, which both owned the dam, dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster.

Immediately after the disaster, government and local authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. However, numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded in the previous months and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it. The communist newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; was the first to denounce the actions of management and government.

===Secretary of Christian Democracy===

In January 1964, Rumor was elected the DC secretary, holding the office until January 1969 and leading the party in a complex phase of government cooperation with the socialists. In the five years leading the DC, Rumor tried to reassure the moderate electorate, in an attempt to recover the consensus lost in the previous elections.

Rumor embodied the typical characteristics of the Dorotheans: caution, moderation, the propensity for mediation rather than for decision, attention to practical and concrete topics, rather than to major strategies, the representation of the interests of the provincial middle class, the privileged link with the public administration, with the Catholic world and with direct farmers. In the general elections of 1968, the DC managed to increase its votes, albeit slightly, gaining 39% of votes. This result was experienced as a success by the Rumor secretariat and he became a natural candidate for the leadership of the government.

===First term as prime minister===
On 13 December 1968, Mariano Rumor was sworn in as prime minister for the first time, leading a government composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists and Republicans.

During his first term as prime minister, a number of progressive reforms were carried out. A law of 11 December 1969 extended access to higher education to all students holding a higher secondary school diploma. It was formerly limited to students who came from classical, and in some cases, scientific, curricula. A bill, approved on 30 April 1969 introduced broad provisions covering pensions under the general scheme. The multiplying coefficient was increased to 1.85%, applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 5 years of work (maximum pension, after 40 years of contribution: 74% of previous earnings). A social pension was also introduced for people over the age of 65 with low incomes and not eligible for any type of pension. In addition, cost of living indexation for all pensions (with the exception of social pensions) was introduced. A law of 2 February 1970 extended earnings replacement benefits to artisan undertakings in the construction industry.
In foreign policy, Rumor signed, on 28 January 1969, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, his first term as prime minister was deeply marked by the Piazza Fontana massacre, a terrorist attack that occurred on 12 December 1969 when a bomb exploded at the headquarters of National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, Milan, killing 17 people and wounding 88. In the same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in Rome and Milan, and another was found unexploded. The attack was planned by a neo-fascist group, &quot;Ordine Nuovo&quot; (&quot;New Order&quot;), whose aim was to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency.

During his first term, Rumor led three different governments. From December 1968 to July 1969, the DC joined with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) as well as the Italian Republican Party (PRI). Then, from August 1969 to February 1970 he led a DC-only government; its collapse led to a 45-day long period without government, with issues such as Italian divorce law and the status of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) generating instability. After this period, which included an attempt by former Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani to form a government, Rumor led a new coalition with the Socialist, Republican, and Democratic Socialist parties from March until July 1970.

===Interior Minister and assassination attempt===

In 1972, Rumor was appointed Minister of the Interior, in the government of Giulio Andreotti.

In 1973, Rumor was the target of an assassination attempt, planned by Gianfranco Bertoli, a self-described anarchist. Four were killed during the bombing, and 45 injured, while Rumor escaped alive from it. Bertoli was given a life-term in 1975. Bertoli was an informant of SISMI, the &quot;Military Intelligence and Security Service&quot;, at the time. Court proceedings later showed that this connection was one of mistaken identity.

===Second term as prime minister===
After three years under Emilio Colombo and Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s ministries, Rumor returned to the office of Prime Minister, first leading a coalition composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans, and Democratic Socialists from July 1973 to March 1974. After this government collapsed, Rumor formed a new coalition within two weeks, calling upon the Socialists and Democratic Socialists to join with DC from March until October 1974.

During his second term, the Parliament approved a law on 2 March 1974, with which legal minimum for pensions was raised to 27.75% of the average industrial wage for 1973. A law of 16 July 1974 extended family allowances to INPS pensioners, in lieu of child supplements. While a bill of August 1974 extended hospital assistance to all those not previously covered by any scheme.

Weathering a cabinet resignation in June 1974, Rumor&#x27;s final cabinet would fall in October 1974 after failing to come to an agreement on how to deal with rising economic inflation.

===After the premiership===

In November 1974, Rumor was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in Aldo Moro&#x27;s fourth cabinet.

During his ministry, he signed the Osimo Treaty with Yugoslavia, defining the official partition of the Free Territory of Trieste. The port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the north west (Zone A) was given to Italy; a portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula (Zone B) was given to Yugoslavia.

The Italian government was harshly criticized for signing the treaty, particularly for the secretive way in which negotiations were carried out, skipping the traditional diplomatic channels. Italian nationalists of the MSI rejected the idea of giving up Istria, since Istria had been an ancient &quot;Italian&quot; region together with the Venetian region (&quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;). Furthermore, Istria had belonged to Italy for 25 years between World War I and the end of World War II, and the west coast of Istria had long had a sizeable Italian minority population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valussi/Ressmann&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nationalist politicians called for the prosecution of Prime Minister Moro and Minister Rumor, for the crime of treason, as stated in Article 241 of the Italian Criminal Code, which mandated a life sentence for anybody found guilty of aiding and abetting a foreign power to exert its sovereignty on the national territory.

The defeat in the 1975 regional elections led to the removal of Amintore Fanfani from the party secretariat. Rumor was proposed by Moro as the new party secretary, but he was vetoed by some members of his own faction. Due to this veto, Rumor abandoned the Dorotheans, approaching the positions of the new secretary Benigno Zaccagnini. Following the Dorotheans&#x27; split, Rumor was slowly excluded from relevant positions in the party and in the government.

In 1979, Mariano Rumor was elected in the European Parliament, where he later became Chair of the Political Affairs Committee in 1980, serving in that post until he left the European Parliament in 1984.

==Death and legacy==

Rumor died of a heart attack in Vicenza on 22 January 1990 at the age of 74.

In the years since his death, Rumor&#x27;s legacy has been widely debated. The Lockheed bribery scandals, of which Rumor was exonerated by the Italian Parliament, took place under his government and culminated in the trials of two former Defense ministers, Luigi Gui and Mario Tanassi. Rumor was implicated in the scandal after a Lockheed codebook referenced &quot;Antelope Cobbler&quot; as &quot;Prime Minister&quot;, which could have been any of Rumor, Aldo Moro, or then-President Giovanni Leone during the relevant time period. While Leone later resigned from the Presidency due to accusations of corruption, none of the three men were ever convicted of being &quot;Antelope Cobbler&quot;.

Others have criticized his Presidential Decree No. 1092, a measure which allowed Italian governmental workers to retire after nineteen and a half years of work or fourteen and a half years if they were a woman; such retirees were later termed &quot;baby pensioners&quot; by detractors. The program, instituted in 1973, was terminated in 1992. As of 2014 it was estimated that around half a million pensioners who benefited from the decree were still drawing an average of €1,500 per month.

==Personal life==
Rumor never married. During all his lifetime and even after his death, speculations arose around his possible homosexuality. However, Rumor had always denied these speculations, which would have ruined his career in a social conservative party like the DC.

<doc id="628417" wikidata="Q372954" url="?curid=628417" title="Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia">
<text>Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia (; 18 September 1891 – 5 March 1942) was a son of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, a grandson of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and a first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II, Marie of Edinburgh (consort of Ferdinand I of Romania), King George II of Greece, King Alexander of Greece, Helen of Greece and Denmark, (second wife of Carol II of Romania), King Paul of Greece, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (consort of Queen Elizabeth II).

His early life was marked by the death of his mother and his father&#x27;s banishment from Russia after marrying a commoner in 1902. Grand Duke Dmitri and his elder sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, to whom he remained very close throughout his life, were raised in Moscow by their paternal uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia, an older sister of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. His uncle was killed in 1905 and as his aunt entered religious life, Dmitri spent a great deal of his youth in the company of Tsar Nicholas II and his immediate family at the Alexander Palace as they viewed him almost like a foster son.

Grand Duke Dmitri followed a military career, graduating from the . He was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment. An excellent equestrian, he competed in the Olympic Games of 1912 in Stockholm. As a grandson of Tsar Alexander II in the male line, he occupied a prominent position as the Russian imperial court, but he had little interest in his military career, leading instead a fast life. Through his friendship with Felix Yusupov, he took part in the assassination of the mystic Grigori Rasputin, who was seen to have an undue and insidious influence on the Tsar and his wife.

Banished to the war front in Persia, he escaped the Russian Revolution and emigrated to Western Europe. He lived briefly in England, and during the 1920s in Paris, where he had a brief but notorious affair with the famous French fashion designer Coco Chanel. He also lived briefly in the United States. In 1926, he married Audrey Emery, an American heiress. The couple had a son before divorcing in 1937.

As the youngest Grand Duke to have survived the Russian Revolution, he was a prominent figure in the Russian community in exile, but he was not interested in politics, supporting instead the claim of his first cousin, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia. By the outbreak of World War II, his health was already in decline, and he died of tuberculosis in Davos, Switzerland aged 50.

==Early life==

Grand Duke Dmitri was born on 18 September [O.S. 6 September] 1891 as the second child and only son of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and his first wife, Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia, born Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. Dmitri&#x27;s father, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, was the youngest child of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and his first wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna. Dmitri&#x27;s mother, Alexandra, was a daughter of George I of Greece and Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, and a sister of King Constantine I, and Andrew who was the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, making them first cousins. He was also first cousins to Marie, Queen of Romania and Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia, who were the daughters of his paternal aunt Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia who married Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

The birth took place under tragic circumstances. During the summer of 1891, Grand Duchess Alexandra and Grand Duke Paul visited Paul&#x27;s brother Grand Duke Serge Alexandrovich at his country estate near Moscow. Alexandra was seven months pregnant with Dmitri when, while taking a stroll with some friends by the Moskva River, she jumped into a boat, falling as she got in. The next day, she collapsed in the middle of a ball from violent labor pains brought on by the previous day&#x27;s activities; Dmitri was born in the hours following the accident. Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. She died of eclampsia six days after Dmitri&#x27;s birth. Although doctors had no hope for Dmitri&#x27;s survival, he still lived, with the help of his uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dmitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him in cotton wool and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated, the treatment of the time to keep premature babies alive.
At birth, Dmitri had an older sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, with whom he had a close relationship throughout his life. Grand Duke Paul was so distraught by the unexpected death of his young wife that he initially neglected his two small children: Dmitri and his older sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna. The children were therefore largely cared for by Paul&#x27;s elder brother, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, who had no children of their own. They spent Christmases and later some summer holidays with Grand Duke Sergei and Grand Duchess Elisabeth who set aside a playroom and bedrooms for the youngsters at their country home, Ilinskoe.

In his widowhood, Grand Duke Paul settled with his children in his palace in St Petersburg. The children occupied a nursery suite on the second floor, looked after by nurses and attendants. A commander of the imperial Horse Guards, Grand Duke Paul loved his children, but as was customary at the time, he refrained from showing them spontaneous affection. Dmitri and his sister were initially educated at home by governesses and private tutors, while they adored their father who visited them twice daily. Like all male members of the Romanov family, Grand Duke Dmitri was destined to follow a military career which traditionally began for a Grand Duke at the age of seven. This was delayed, in Dmitri&#x27;s case, until he was nine years old. In the spring of 1901, his education was entrusted to General George Mikhailovich Laiming. Laiming was a warm, affectionate man who became devoted to his charge. He moved into the palace with his wife and their four-year-old son Boris. In their apartments, Dmitri and his sister enjoyed a warm family environment.

==Youth and education==
In 1895, Grand Duke Paul began an affair with a married woman, Olga Valerianova Pistolkors. He was able to obtain a divorce for her and he eventually married Olga in 1902, while the couple was staying abroad. The marriage was a violation of the house law of the Romanovs, and as they had married defying Nicholas II&#x27;s opposition, the Tsar forbade them to return to Russia and Grand Duke Paul was not allowed to take the children with him into exile. Left fatherless, eleven-year-old Dmitri and his twelve-year-old sister were sent to live with their uncle, Grand Duke Sergei, and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (the Empress&#x27;s sister), in Moscow.

The loss of their father and the sudden move to Moscow caused the children great distress. In her memoirs, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (the Younger) describes Grand Duke Sergei as a stern disciplinarian, and his wife, Grand Duchess Elizabeth as a cold and unwelcoming presence. In 1903, at the age of twelve, Dmitri was enrolled in the Chevalier Guard regiment following studies at the Calvary Academy.

On 4 February 1905, Grand Duke Sergei, who had recently resigned from the post of Governor-General of Moscow, was assassinated by Ivan Kalyaev, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Kalyaev, armed with a homemade bomb, had aborted his first attempt to kill the Grand Duke when he spotted Dmitri and Marie with their uncle in his carriage. The assassination of Grand Duke Sergei is the subject matter of the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus&#x27; 1949 play &quot;The Just Assassins&quot;. His uncle&#x27;s death was only one of several assassinations that robbed Dmitri of close family members. After Sergei&#x27;s death, Dmitri&#x27;s father, Grand Duke Paul was allowed to return to Russia to attend the funeral. He asked Nicholas II to restore the custody of his children but instead, Nicholas named Sergei&#x27;s widow Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna as the children&#x27;s guardian.
Maria Pavlovna continued to have some feelings of anger toward her aunt, whom she would blame for her overly hasty and unsuccessful marriage to Prince Wilhem of Sweden in 1908, but Dmitri formed a very strong bond with Elizabeth and came to admire her personal fortitude.

==Formative years==

Maria Pavlovna&#x27;s wedding to Prince William took place at Tsarskoe Selo in 1908, and she departed for Sweden with her husband. Elizabeth Feodorovna stayed on for a time at Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo as guests of the Emperor and the Empress. It was during this period that Dmitri began to form a close bond with Nicholas II, looking upon him as a surrogate father. He joined him on his daily walks and sought to spend as much time with him as possible. Nicholas, in turn, treated Dmitri very kindly. He seems to have loved the young man&#x27;s free spirit and sense of humor, a welcome diversion from the stresses of his daily life.

In 1909, Dmitri left his aunt&#x27;s care to move to St Petersburg with his head tutor and companion, General Laiming. He lived at his father&#x27;s vacant palace and then at the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, which he had inherited from his uncle Grand Duke Sergei, and would become his principal residence until he left Russia. He enrolled in the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School, and upon graduation, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment, which his father had once commanded.
As a cousin of Tsar Nicholas II in the male line, he occupied a prominent position as the Russian imperial court, and lead a fast life in the Russian upper class. He was an excellent equestrian, and he competed in show jumping at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. He placed ninth in the individual jumping event whereas Russia placed fifth in the team jumping event. Disappointed in the performance of the Russian team, Dmitri started the idea of a national Russian sports competition, the very beginning of what under Soviet rule became the Spartakiad.
In Spring 1914, Dmitri&#x27;s father returned to live in Russia, settling with his second wife and new family at Tsarskoye Selo. Around the same time, Dmitri&#x27;s sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, who had divorced her husband, also returned to Russia moving with Dmitri. However, troubled by her strong need for him, Dmitri distanced himself somewhat from his sister, hurting her terribly. A few months later, World War I began. All members of the family joined the war effort. Dmitri served with the Life Guard Horse Regiment, participating in the campaign in East Prussia. During the first weeks of the war he was awarded the Order of St. George after he rescued a wounded corporal under heavy gunfire.

In 1914, his friend Felix Yusupov married the Tsar&#x27;s only niece, Princess Irina. After this, according to Meriel Buchanan, he became &quot;more recklessly dissipated&quot;, helpless and desolate. Historian Greg King claimed that Dmitri &quot;harboured an intensely romantic devotion&quot; to the openly bisexual Felix. Felix himself claimed that it was because Dimitri had wanted to marry Irina himself.

==Killing of Rasputin==

In August 1915 when Nicholas II left St. Petersburg to take full command of the Russian armies fighting World War I, his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna took on the daily administrative affairs of the government from the capital. Alexandra relied on Grigori Rasputin, a peasant healer who appeared to have brought her hemophiliac son Alexei, the Tsarevich, back from the brink of death. As Russian defeats mounted during the war, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. Eventually, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich joined Felix Yusupov, Vladimir Purishkevich (the leader of the monarchists in the Duma) Dr. Stanislaus de Lazovert and Lieutenant Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin, an officer in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, in a conspiracy to kill Grigory Rasputin hoping that ending his influence over the imperial family this would have a beneficial effect on the Tsar&#x27;s policies.

On Friday night 16/17 December (OS), Yusupov, who had visited Rasputin regularly in the past few months for treatment, invited Rasputin to his home. With Stanislaus de Lazovert dressed in a chauffeur uniform, Felix went to Rasputin&#x27;s home to pick him up. Around 1:30 am, they arrived at Yusupov&#x27;s Moika Palace where a room in the basement in the east wing had been specially prepared for the killing. For about an hour, Felix entertained the unsuspected Rasputin with red wine until he got him drunk. Then, while both were sitting, Yusupov shot Rasputin at close range using Dmitri&#x27;s Browning pistol. The bullet entered Rasputin&#x27;s body from the left side perforating the stomach, liver, and kidney. The wound was lethal, but Rasputin did not die right away, bleeding profusely instead. In shock, Yusupov let Rasputin alone to die. He joined his fellow conspirators: Grand Duke Dmitri, politician Vladimir Purishkevich, and army officer Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin who were waiting in a ground floor study/drawing-room. Meanwhile, Rasputin, still alive, tried to flee through a side door into a gated courtyard that opened onto the street outside. Alarmed he might escape, Purishkevich then shot Rasputin in the back, on the doorstep. The bullet lodged into the vertebral column. The body was taken inside and Rasputin was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. In a rage, Yusopov kicked Rasputin&#x27;s corpse with the tip of his military boots, smashing his nose and right eye and disfiguring his face. Then the assassins drove to Varshavsky Rail Terminal where they burned Rasputin&#x27;s clothes and returned to Yusupov&#x27;s home. At 4.50 a.m. Dmitri drove the men and Rasputin&#x27;s body, wrapped in a broadcloth, to Petrovskii Bridge, which crossed to Krestovsky Island. About 5 a.m, they threw the body into the Malaya Neva into a hole they made in the ice. All along, Grand Duke Dmitri, who was driving the car, never saw Rasputin.

News of Rasputin&#x27;s murder spread quickly. That Saturday, an evening newspaper already published details of the assassination correctly identifying the place and some of the details. By Sunday, Dmitri was placed under house arrest. Felix Yusupov, who had tried to flee to Crimea was stopped at the train station. He was then living at his mother-in-law&#x27;s palace, but on the advice of his uncle by marriage Grand Duke Nicholas Michailovich, he moved to Dmitri&#x27;s palace for protection as it was the prerogative of the Tsar alone to prosecute members of the Imperial family.

Rasputin&#x27;s body was found on 19 December by a river policeman who was walking on the ice and discovered the frozen body. The post-mortem was held the following day. Major-General Popel carried out the investigation of the murder. By this time Dr. Stanislaus de Lazovert and Lieutenant Sergei Mikhailovich Sukhotin had fled from the city. He did interview Grand Duke Dmitri, Felix Yusupov, and Vladimir Purishkevich, but he decided not to charge them with murder.

==Exile==
===Banishment to Persia===

As a result of his participation in Rasputin&#x27;s assassination, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich was banished from the Russian court and was sent to exile to the Persian war front. Pleas for clemency from Romanov relatives on his behalf were dismissed by the Tsar. In the early hours of , Grand Duke Dmitri left Saint Peterburg never to return. After four days of travel, he reached Baku on the Caspian Sea, sailing the next morning to the southern, Persian shore.

At his arrival in Persia, he was welcomed by his officers as his reputation for the Rasputin assassination had made him popular. He served ten weeks under General Nikolai Baratov who headed the 1st Caucasus Cossack Corps on the Caucasus Front in the Persian city of Qazvin. Within two months Nicholas II was forced to abdicate ending the rule of the Romanov dynasty. General Baratov asked Dmitri to leave since there were rumblings from the lower ranks, and his safety could not be guaranteed. Ronald Wingate entertained Pavlovich when he passed through Najaf. The Provisional Government invited him to return to Russia, but he declined. Lacking both friends and money, he lived precariously. In the summer of 1917, Dmitri left the Russian occupation zone moving to Tehran. Dmitri stayed briefly with General Meidel , then the head of the Persian Cossack Division, before being taken in by the British Minister to Tehran, Sir Charles Murray Marling, and his wife, Lucia. Through 1917 and most of 1918 Grand Duke Dmitri lived with the Marlings.

Marling obtained an honorary commission for Pavlovich as a liaison officer with the British Mission and eventually persuaded the British Foreign Office in 1918 that he would become the next Emperor of Russia, gaining his admission to England. Marling became an important father figure to Pavlovich, and the relationship there established between them would prove to be close and enduring.

===Interlude in England===

Marling and his family took Pavlovich with them when they left Tehran for England at the end of 1918. During the long journey to England in a slow steamer, Pavlovich fell ill with typhoid fever in Bombay and nearly died. He had to recuperate in Cairo. In January 1919 he arrived in France via Egypt. He crossed the Mediterranean, disembarked in Marseilles, continuing by land to Paris. He had kept an apartment at the Hotel Georges V, and in France, he learned of the tragic end of many of his Romanovs relatives. The Marlings took him to London where he was reunited with his maternal aunt Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna. She provided him with the money from the proceeds from the sale of his St Petersburg palace, which had gone through before the Bolsheviks seized power. Pavlovich took a room at the Ritz and spent most of his time with his aunt.

Lady Marling went to see the King&#x27;s assistant private secretary Lord Cromer to inform him of the grand duke&#x27;s arrival. King George V was horrified; his presence was an inconvenience to the British government that did not want to upset the new Bolshevik regime.

In London, Dmitri was finally reunited with his sister Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna who had escaped Revolutionary Russia though Ukraine with her second husband, Prince Sergei Mikhailovich Putiatin. Dmitri moved with his sister and brother-in-law taking a house together in South Kensington. The Yusupovs had escaped Russia with the Dowager Empress, Maria Feodorovna, and they too settled in London. Pavlovich avoided Yusupov, resenting his breaking the silence regarding the details of Rasputin&#x27;s assassination. Relations between Dmitri and Putiatin also soon soured. In spring 1920, Maria Pavlovna returned to Paris to meet with their stepmother, Princess Olga Paley, and their two half-sisters. She decided to stay in the French capital in order to be close to them. Unhappy in England, Dmitri followed his sister to Paris in the summer of 1920.

===Exile in Paris===

In Paris, Dmitri took rooms at a hotel until he found a modest two-room apartment. The proceeds from the sale of his St Peterburg palace enabled him to live well but they depleted quickly. He had given generously to other emigres in need and to Russian charities. In the summer of 1921, Dmitri accompanied his sister to Denmark to a reunion with her son Prince Lennart. While in Denmark, Dmitri saw the Marling family again and with his sister visited Maria Feodorovna, who had retired to her villa Hvidore.

With his economic resources depleting, Grand Duke Dmitri found employment serving on the board of a Champagne firm. An American journalist described him around this time as attractive: &quot;He is, in his slender well-groomed person, all that a grand duke should be – especially if you like your grand duke young, clean-shaven, and concave at the waistline. He has a figure like Rudolph Valentino&quot;. Well known in the Paris scene of the 1920s, Dmitri was then having an affair with opera singer Marthe Davelli. It was through her that Dmitri became close to Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel. &quot;You take him&quot;, the singer allegedly offered him to her old friend: &quot;He is too expensive for me&quot;. Chanel and Dmitri, who had actually met before in pre-World War I Paris, became lovers. Their relationship lasted around a year. It began in spring 1921 with an off-season stay in Monte Carlo where they tried to live as discreetly as possible. Dmitri&#x27;s sister, Maria Pavlovna, found a niche for herself in the rising Paris fashion industry by founding a business called &quot;Kitmir&quot; that specialized in bead and sequin embroidery and did much work for Chanel. It was Dmitri who introduced Chanel to Ernest Beaux, the perfumer who created Chanel No. 5, her most enduring product. Coco and Dmitri spent a happy summer at a villa near Arcachon. Their romance fizzled out, but they remained friends. Chanel would later comment: &quot;These grand dukes, they are all the same, an admirable face behind which there is nothing, green eyes, broad shoulders, fine hands... the most peaceful people, shyness itself. They drink just not to be afraid. Tall, handsome, superb these Russians are. And behind that is nothing: hollowness and vodka.&quot;

As the youngest Grand Duke to have survived the Russian Revolution, Pavlovich was a prominent figure of the Russian community in exile. He had been proposed as a potential candidate for the throne by several monarchist groups. During the early 1920s, there was a bitter rivalry between the camps of the supporters of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and those of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich. While those who supported neither Nicholas nor Kirill advocated for Dmitri&#x27;s candidacy for the Russian throne.

On 8 August 1922, a makeshift Zemsky Sobor was convened at Priamurye, and Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich was &quot;elected&quot; Emperor. The Grand Duke neither accepted nor refused this empty gesture. Having waited for confirmation of the death of Tsar Nicholas II, his son, and his brother, in 1924 Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich announced (also on 8 August) that he would assume &quot;guardianship&quot; of the throne of Russia. Shortly thereafter, on 13 September, he issued his manifesto on the assumption of all imperial rights and the title of Emperor. On 25 September 1924, Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich issued an appeal to Russians to stand with Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. It was at this time that Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had no political ambitions for himself, supported instead the claim of his first cousin, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. Grand Duke Dmitri was also active politically. Together with his cousin, Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich, he was very involved in the monarchist youth organizations which sprang up in the years between the wars. By 1923, the largest of these was the &quot;Union of Young Russia&quot; which preached orthodoxy, nationalism, monarchism and peasant collectivism.

===Marriage===

In 1923 Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna divorced her second husband and bought a small house at Boulogne-sur-Seine and Dmitri moved with her to the top floor. As he worked at Reims for the champagne company, he was out most of the day but spent the evening with his sister. Invited to a tea party at Versailles with his sister, he met Audrey Emery, a sophisticated and attractive American heiress. Her father was a self-made millionaire and after his death, her mother had married a son of the second Earl of Lichfield. Grand Duke Dmitri had no fortune to offer, but they fell in love and they were married in the Orthodox Church at Biarritz on 21 November 1926. It was a morganatic marriage, and Audrey, who converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Anna Ioannovna in baptism, was granted the title &quot;Her Serene Highness, Princess Romanovskaya-Ilyinskaya&quot; by his cousin, Grand Duke Kyril. They spent their honeymoon in England where they established their first home. The couple&#x27;s only child, Paul Romanovsky-Ilyinsky, was born in London in 1928. Paul grew up in France, Britain, and the United States; he served as a US Marine in the Korean War. In 1989, he was elected Mayor of Palm Beach, Florida, and thus became the only Romanov descendant known to have held elected public office. Following the fall of communist Russia in 1991, a delegation of Russian royalists approached him and asked him to assume the title of Tsar, which he declined.

In 1928, the Dowager Empress died, and Grand Duke Kirill was received at the funeral as head of the House of Romanoff by the royal family of Denmark – it was the last time that the entire dynasty appeared as a single undivided family and Grand Duke Dmitri was a prominent figure in the proceedings. The youngest of the Grand Dukes, Dmitri Pavlovich frequently represented Grand Duke Kirill at events public, private, and political. He was prominent at the funerals of King Constantine I of Greece (1923), Queen Astrid of the Belgians (1935), at the wedding of Grand Duke Kirill&#x27;s daughter, Grand Duchess Kira to Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1938), and also at the ceremonies surrounding the accession of Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia to the rights of the headship of the imperial house on the death of his father in 1938.

Grand Duke Dmitri was a noted collector of model trains and was at one point considered to have had one of the largest collections in Europe. During the Nazi annexation of Paris, Dmitri&#x27;s collection vanished, and it has since been theorized that they were seized by Hermann Göring, a model train collector himself.

In the late 1920s, Grand Duke Dmitri became involved with his cousin, Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich Romanoff in the monarchist youth organizations which sprang up in the years between the wars. By 1923, the largest of these was the Union of Young Russians which was renamed the &quot;Union of Mladorossi&quot; (Cоюз Младороссов) by 1925. It was a Russian nationalist group influenced by Italian Fascism, formed with the express purpose of establishing a &quot;Soviet monarchy&quot; in Russia. He joined this group as a stand-in for Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who, as pretender to the throne, could not affiliate himself directly with any political organization or party. In 1935, Grand Duke Dmitri gave a series of speeches to Young Russia chapters throughout France. Over the course of the next few years, however, he grew very disillusioned with the group, and he ultimately broke with it entirely. He loathed Hitler and National Socialism, and he spoke out publicly against Hitler in January 1939. Grand Duke Dmitri reputedly rebuked later advances from Hitler to lead exiled Russian nobles within the German army against the Bolsheviks with the firm statement that nothing would induce him to fight against fellow Russians. 

==Last years==
Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and his wife could afford a very opulent lifestyle with homes in London, Biarritz, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and Château de Beaumesnil near Caen, and visits to America. After ten years of marriage, they were divorced in 1937. Dmitri then lived at the Château de Beaumesnil in Beaumesnil, Eure, France, which he had bought in 1927. Over the years, Dmitri became disappointed with the prospects for the restoration of the monarchy in Russia and withdrew from public life. He lived at the Château de Beaumesnil until 1938 when, due to the deterioration of his health, he sold the château.

In 1937, his ex-wife remarried. His son was at school in England, but Dmitri could spend the school holidays with him until 1939, when it was decided to send Paul to America for safety. They saw each other for the last time in Genoa spending three days before Paul embarked to America.

Despite not having strong health, Grand Duke Dmitri was, for most of his life, a very active sportsman, excelling at polo, horse riding, tennis, and bobsledding. His doctors in London and Davos estimated that he first contracted tuberculosis around 1929, which ran a chronic course. He entered the &quot;Sanatorium Schatzalp&quot; in Davos, Switzerland on 2 September 1939, the day after the German invasion of Poland, and remarked in a letter to his sister that he had never before spent a single night in any kind of hospital or medical institution. His health began a steady decline in August 1940. In the autumn of that year, he underwent an unsuccessful operation and was confined to bed for three months afterward. After two more operations, in January and February 1941, the doctors spoke optimistically. From the safety of the sanatorium in Davos, Dmitri followed with great interest the events of World War II; he wrote to a friend on 10 April 1940, on the eve of the collapse of France, &quot;everything starts looking petty in comparison with world events&quot;.

On 4 March 1942, Grand Duke Dmitri organized a Russian festival to entertain himself with his friend and the staff. The celebration continued until late into the night. The following morning Dmitri suffered a sudden attack of uremia and died at the age of fifty. He was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof, Davos. After the death of Dmitri&#x27;s sister Maria Pavlovna in December 1958, his nephew, Prince Lennart Bernadotte, had him buried alongside his sister, in the chapel of his castle on the island of Mainau in Lake Constance, where they now lie beside his sister in the Bernadotte family crypt.

<text>WMSN-TV (channel 47) is a television station in Madison, Wisconsin, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. Owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station has studios on Big Sky Drive on the west side of Madison, and its transmitter is located on South Pleasant View Road in the Junction Ridge neighborhood also on Madison&#x27;s west side. 

==History==

WMSN-TV commenced broadcasting on June 8, 1986, airing on analog UHF channel 47. It was the first new commercial station to launch in the Madison market since WISC-TV signed on thirty years earlier. One of WMSN&#x27;s earlier programs was &quot;Big Sky Theater&quot;, a Saturday night presentation of classic movies (mostly westerns) from the drive-in era. The program&#x27;s name was an acknowledgement to the Big Sky Drive-In Theater, which shared a street with the newly built studios for WMSN; its next-door neighbor remains a movie theater, the Marcus Point Cinema.

The station was originally owned by Channel 47 LP, a group of investors led by Ronald J. Koeppler. On April 1, 1996, Channel 47 LP filed to sell WMSN-TV to Sullivan Broadcasting, owners of the existing Act III Broadcasting stations, for $26.5 million. Sullivan would later sell all of the stations to Sinclair Broadcast Group in a group deal two years later.

After a few months as an independent, the station joined Fox as a charter affiliate on October 9, 1986. Since 1994, as a result of Fox&#x27;s NFC football package, WMSN has been Madison&#x27;s primary home for the Green Bay Packers; these broadcasts are routinely the highest-rated programs in the market during football season.

==Newscasts==
In 1999, ABC affiliate WKOW (then owned by the Shockley Communications Corporation) entered into a news share agreement with WMSN, which resulted in Madison&#x27;s first nightly prime time newscast, known as &quot;Fox 47 News at 9&quot;. The newscast, initially 35 minutes in length on weeknights and 30 minutes on weekends, was originally produced from a secondary set at WKOW&#x27;s studios on Tokay Boulevard in Madison. The newscasts employed no WKOW on-air branding, instead using Sinclair&#x27;s standard music-and-graphics packages. Although the newscasts featured appearances from additional WKOW personnel, WMSN maintained separate weeknight anchors that normally did not appear on WKOW except to fill-in when needed.

On January 1, 2012, WMSN&#x27;s news share agreement with WKOW expired after nearly 13 years (WMSN General Manager Kerry Johnson termed the split as a &quot;business decision&quot;). On that same date, WMSN began a new news outsourcing agreement with WISC-TV, the Morgan Murphy Media–owned CBS affiliate in Madison; as a result, WISC cancelled its own 9 p.m. weeknight newscast it had produced for its subchannel TVW, making &quot;Fox 47 News at 9&quot; the only remaining prime time newscast in the Madison market until WMTV established its own 9 p.m. newscast on its CW-affiliated subchannel in November 2016. Mirroring its agreement with WKOW, &quot;Fox 47 News at 9&quot; originates not from WMSN&#x27;s studios but from WISC&#x27;s Raymond Road studios, utilizes WISC&#x27;s news staff (except the main news anchors), and employs studio backdrops and Sinclair&#x27;s standard news graphics that help differentiate the newscasts from those on WISC. It was also during this period with WISC (in February 2016) that &quot;Fox 47 News at 9&quot; would move to a full-hour time period each night.

In 2018, Sinclair required all of its television stations to air a message that called out &quot;biased and fake news&quot; and says &quot;national media outlets are publishing these same fake stories without checking facts first.&quot; However, because WMSN&#x27;s newscast is produced by WISC-TV pursuant to the above-mentioned news-share agreement, no such segment was produced for WMSN, and was disclaimed as such on WMSN&#x27;s social media channels.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WMSN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 47, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 11, using virtual channel 47. Since then, WMSN would relocate twice, to channel 49 in November 2010 and to channel 18 in October 2019.

In September 2010, WMSN-TV established its first digital subchannel, adding TheCoolTV music video network to subchannel 47.2. The subchannel would go dark in September 2012 at the expiration of Sinclair&#x27;s carriage agreement with TheCoolTV. In July 2014, the channel was reactivated as an affiliate of GetTV, which would be replaced on October 31, 2015 by Sinclair-owned sci-fi network Comet.

When it relocated to physical channel 11 in 2010, WMSN would add a third subchannel, 47.3, with content from The Country Network, later known as ZUUS Country. That network would be replaced in 2014 by the action-oriented Grit network. Grit would be replaced on June 1, 2017, by another action network, Sinclair-owned Charge!. On that same date, a fourth subchannel, 47.4, was activated and affiliated with TBD.

<text>PC Gamer is a magazine and website founded in the United Kingdom in 1993 devoted to PC gaming and published monthly by Future plc. The magazine has several regional editions, with the UK and US editions becoming the best selling PC games magazines in their respective countries. The magazine features news on developments in the video game industry, previews of new games, and reviews of the latest popular PC games, along with other features relating to hardware, mods, &quot;classic&quot; games and various other topics. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and parent Future began digital &quot;PC Gaming Show&quot; at E3 2015.

== Review system ==
&quot;PC Gamer&quot; reviews are written by the magazine&#x27;s editors and freelance writers, and rate games on a percent scale. In August 2023, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; became the first game to receive a rating of 97% in the UK edition. Prior to this, no game was awarded more than 96% by the UK edition (&quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot;, &quot;Civilization II&quot;, &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, &quot;Minecraft&quot;, &quot;Spelunky&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot;). In the US edition, no game has yet received a rating higher than 98% (&quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, and &quot;Crysis&quot;).

In the UK edition, the lowest numerical score was 2%, awarded to The 4th Golden Satellite Awards for Interactive Media Winner &quot;Big Brother 1&quot;. The sequel, &quot;Big Brother 2&quot;, was given an even lower score of N/A%, the review explaining that &quot;[&quot;PC Gamer&quot;] put as much effort into reviewing it as they did in making the game&quot;. In issue 255, August 2013, the score of 2% was matched by the review of the re-released &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude&quot;, originally given 3% when it first launched. In the US edition, the lowest score awarded was 4%, given to &quot;Mad Dog McCree&quot;, unseating the previously lowest-rated game, &quot;Skydive!&quot;, given 5%.
== Editions ==
There are two main editions of &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, a British version and an American version, both are published by Future plc. Founded in the United Kingdom in November 1993, the American sister version was launched a few months later in June 1994.

There are also numerous local editions that mainly use the materials of one of the two editions, typically the British one, including a Malaysian (discontinued in December 2011) and Russian edition (discontinued in December 2008). The Swedish edition, though rooted in its UK counterpart, has grown to be more independent, largely due to the immense popularity of PC games compared to console games in Sweden, and now produces most of its own material. An Australian edition was published monthly by Perth-based Conspiracy Publishing since August 1998, but it appears to have been discontinued in mid-late 2004. A Spanish edition titled &quot;PC Juegos y Jugadores&quot; also existed, but closed in 2007.

Both American and British magazines are published thirteen times per year (twice in December), although there are sometimes variations.

In 2018, Future purchased Australian video game magazine and website &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; from nextmedia, incorporating &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; articles into the online version of &quot;PC Gamer&quot;.

== &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK ==
=== Magazine ===
The British edition of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; has been in constant monthly publication since 1993. Subscribers get a special edition of the magazine with no headlines on the front cover (only the masthead and BBFC rating).

Almost exclusively devoted to PC games, the magazine has a reputation for giving in-depth reviews.

The magazine originally shipped with an accompanying floppy disc. A CD demo disc (labelled &quot;CD Gamer&quot;) was released alongside the floppy disk edition from issue 11 onwards with the first CD Gamer containing all the content from the previous 10 issues&#x27; floppy discs. The single CD was later expanded to two CDs.

An edition with a 9 GB DVD known as &quot;DVD Gamer&quot; ran alongside the 2CD edition for a couple of years, until production of the CD Gamer edition ceased as of issue 162. The UK Edition then only came with a single double-sided DVD. In August 2011, the UK magazine announced it was to be discontinuing the disk as of issue 232, and replacing it with more pages of content within the magazine and exclusive free gifts.

==== Regular features ====
The magazine has many regular features which make up each edition of the magazine. These include sections called ´&quot;Eyewitness&quot;´, ´&quot;Previews&quot;´, ´&quot;Send&quot;´, where letters from the readers are spread over 2 two-page spreads, at least one special feature, which reports on gaming related issues such as the effect of PC gaming on the environment, a review section which reviews the latest released PC games and re-reviews titles that have been released on budget and ´&quot;Extra Life&quot;´ which reports on modding games and gaming culture and revisiting old games.
There is also a ´&quot;Systems&quot;´ section, which reviews and recommends hardware such as video cards and monitors. The back page of the magazine is entitled ´&quot;It&#x27;s All Over&quot;´ and usually consists of game related artwork such as a version of Dalí&#x27;s &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; featuring items from &quot;Portal&quot;. For a time, one of the magazine&#x27;s features, ´&quot;Gamer Snap&quot;´, where amusing pictures sent in by readers were printed in the magazine, however the feature was discontinued and replaced with a &quot;Guess the Game&quot; where readers sent in drawings of memorable scenes in video games drawn in Microsoft Paint.

=== Forum and blog ===
The &quot;PC Gamer&quot; blog was started to coincide with the transfer of the &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK site to become part of the Computer and Video Games network which incorporates all of Future plc&#x27;s gaming magazines. The move brought some controversy, with many long-standing members of the forum leaving due to the new forum&#x27;s cramped spacing, advertising and slow loading times. The introduction of a blog was seen as one of the redeeming features of the switch. The blog has since been regularly updated with contributions from many of the magazine&#x27;s staff. The topics discussed range from the controversy over violent video games, to the benefits of buying a PC over a console.

In 2010, PC Gamer re-launched their website and blog by bringing together the online communities of both the US and UK magazines into one website. As a result, the PC Gamer blog now has contributions from both the US and UK magazines, all hosted at the new website along with the forums for both magazines.

=== Podcast ===
The &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK podcast started on 4 May 2007 and ran 93 episodes until its final episode, which was released on 5 July 2013. It had a rotating cast made up of members of the staff including Chris Thursten, Tom Senior, Graham Smith, Tom Francis, and Marsh Davies. The podcast was formerly hosted by Ross Atherton until his departure in June 2009 and then by Tim Edwards until his departure in 2012. The host position varied between Chris Thursten and Graham Smith from week to week. Previously monthly, the podcast was recorded every fortnight. Participants discussed the games they had been playing and news from the industry, and answered questions submitted via Twitter.

The podcast began again in March 2016 with a new episode being released weekly.
== &quot;PC Gamer&quot; US ==
=== Magazine ===
The American edition of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; launched in 1994.

In 1999, Future US, then known as Imagine Media, purchased the rival magazine &quot;PC Games&quot; and merged its staff into the magazine.

==== Demo disk ====
Similarly to the British edition, the magazine shipped with a demo disk, though diskless versions were available. The CDs were replaced by DVDs in the American edition on a month-to-month basis.

When PC games with full motion video (FMV) sequences were popular in the mid-to-late 1990s, &quot;PC Gamer&#x27;s&quot; CD-ROM included elaborate FMV sequences featuring one of their editors. To access the features of the CD, including the demos, patches and reviews, the user had to navigate a &#x27;basement&#x27;, which played very much like classic PC games such as &quot;Myst&quot;. It was in this game sequence that the magazine&#x27;s mascot, Coconut Monkey, was introduced just as the editor was leaving the magazine, marking the transition from the FMV demo CDs to the more contemporary menu driven demo CDs that were subsequently used. The cover disc of the July 1998 issue of the Slovenian, Swedish, and UK editions of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; were infected with the Marburg virus, which &quot;CNN Money&quot; stated caused the malware to become a &quot;widespread threat&quot;.

In the September 2011 edition of &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, it was announced that they would be dropping the demo disk altogether and concentrating on improving the quality of the magazine instead with a promise of a larger magazine printed on a heavier paper stock. The usual demo disk content would be made available online.

<text>Air Seychelles is the national airline of the Republic of Seychelles. Its head office is located at Seychelles International Airport on the island of Mahé and it operates inter-island and international flights and charter flights.

==History==

===Establishment===
Seychelles Airlines was formed as the national airline of Seychelles on 15 September 1977 by merging two local carriers: Air Mahé and Inter-Island Airways. It was named Air Seychelles in September 1978. The airline began international routes in 1983 to Frankfurt and London.

===Investment===
In February 2012, the United Arab Emirates national carrier, Etihad Airways, invested US$45 million in Air Seychelles for a 40% share in the airline following problems of management and profitability. After operating at a loss for two years in a row, Air Seychelles planned to restructure and re-position itself to return to profit. The airline entered into codeshare agreements with Etihad Airways and started flying to Abu Dhabi in March 2012 to connect to Etihad Airways&#x27; network of destinations.

On 16 March 2012, Air Seychelles announced a two-year business plan including the renewal of its fleet, leveraging Etihad Airways equity partnership – known as Etihad Airways Partners (which also includes Alitalia, Air Serbia and Virgin Australia), the introduction of Airbus A330−200 aircraft after over two decades of an all-Boeing fleet, increased frequencies to key destinations, and closer cooperation with Etihad Airways.

On 12 March 2015, Air Seychelles released their results for 2014, declaring US$3.2 million in net profits.

===Restructuring===
In January 2018, Air Seychelles announced the closure of its sole long-haul route (Paris), the return of its two Airbus A330 long-haul aircraft, and a focus on its regional network. The plan is aimed at ensuring the long-term profitability and sustainability for the airline, in response to rapidly increasing competition. Remco Althuis, Interim CEO, said, &#x27;The launch of competing air services from Europe to Seychelles will significantly impact Air Seychelles&#x27; flights to and from Paris, which account for approximately 30% of total passenger revenue at the airline, making the route unsustainable.&#x27; The airline will refocus on its domestic and regional networks, with a reduced workforce.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
Air Seychelles was established and originally owned by the Government of Seychelles, having purchased and merged several small aircraft operators into one airline. Following problems of management and profitability, Etihad Airways acquired a 40 percent stake in Air Seychelles in 2012, in a deal worth $45m.
On 1 May 2021 it was announced Etihad Airways sold its 40% stake back to the Government of Seychelles.

===Business trends===
The key trends for Air Seychelles over recent years are shown below (as at year ending 31 December): 
===Services===
Air Seychelles VIP is a specialised facility offering services for VIP passengers, aircraft crew and aeronautical technical support, including fixed-base operation which is managed in conjunction with Royal Jet.

The Air Seychelles Plus Programme has been fully integrated into Etihad Guest, the loyalty programme of Etihad Airways, since June 2012.

==Destinations==
, Air Seychelles serves the following destinations:

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Seychelles has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Air India
* South African Airways
* SriLankan Airlines
* Turkish Airlines

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, the Air Seychelles fleet comprises the following aircraft:

===Livery===
In October 2011, after nearly 25 years in their livery using traditional red, white and green local colours with two white terns (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;, the national bird of Seychelles), Air Seychelles painted its first Boeing 767-300ER aircraft in the company&#x27;s new colours. The colours used on the tail end are blue, green, red and white.

<text>Corgarff Castle is located slightly west of the village of Corgarff, in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland. It stands by the Lecht road, which crosses the pass between Strathdon and Tomintoul.

==Life==

The castle was built around 1530 by the Elphinstone family and leased to the Forbes of Towie. In 1571 it was burned by their enemy, Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, resulting in the deaths of Margaret Campbell, Lady Forbes, her children, and numerous others, 26 in total, and giving rise to the ballad Edom o Gordon.

In May 1607 the castle was captured from Alexander, 4th Lord Elphinstone by Alexander Forbes of Towie and his companions, including a piper called George McRobie. They used hammers and battering rams to break down the gate, then fortified the house with a garrison of &quot;Highland thieves and limmers&quot;.

In 1626 it was acquired by the Earl of Mar. In 1645 it was used as an assembly point by the troops of the Marquis of Montrose. It was burned again in both 1689 and 1716 by Jacobite supporters. It was resettled by the Forbes family in 1745 but had to be forfeited due to their Jacobite leanings.

In 1748 it was bought by the British government and rebuilt and extended as a barracks. A detachment of government troops were stationed there, on the military road from Braemar Castle to Fort George, Inverness. Military use continued as late as 1831, after which the tower was used to suppress illegal whisky distilling in the surrounding area. It remained part of the Delnadamph estate belonging to the Stockdale family until they passed the castle into state care in 1961 and gave the ownership of the castle to the Lonach Highland and Friendly Society.

It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public. It has been designated a scheduled ancient monument.

<text>Aleksei Nikolayevich Leontiev (; February 18, 1903 – January 21, 1979), was a Soviet Russian developmental psychologist and philosopher and a founder of activity theory.

== Biography ==
Aleksei Leontiev&#x27;s life was closely linked to the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU). In 1921, he began his studies at the historical-philological faculty of the university. The historical-philological faculty, at the time, included a Department of Philosophy at which Georgy Chelpanov was teaching psychology, and Leontiev studied psychology with him. In 1924, Leontiev graduated from what became the Faculty of Social Sciences. Leontiev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of Marxist psychology as a response to behaviorism and the focus on the stimulus-response mechanism as an explanation for human behavior. Leontiev left Vygotsky&#x27;s group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in Kharkiv. He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters (van der Veer and Valsiner, 1991). Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Later, he became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University. In 1966, Leontiev became the first ever Dean of the newly established Faculty of Psychology at the Moscow State University, where he worked until his death in 1979.

== Scientific work ==
Leontiev&#x27;s early scientific work was done in the framework of Vygotsky&#x27;s cultural-historical research program and focused on the exploration of the phenomenon of cultural mediation. Representative of this period is Leontiev&#x27;s study on mediated memory in children and adults &quot;The development of higher forms of memory&quot;, 1931.

Leontiev&#x27;s own research school is based on a thorough psychological analysis of the phenomenon of activity. Systematic development of the psychological foundations of activity theory was started in the 1930s by Kharkiv group of psychologists headed by Leontiev and included such researchers as Zaporozhets, Galperin, Zinchenko, Bozhovich, Asnin, Lukov, etc. In its fullest form, activity theory was subsequently developed and institutionalized as the leading psychological doctrine in the Soviet Union in the post-war period after Leontiev had moved to Moscow and took a position at the Moscow State University.

For Leontiev, the psychological of &#x27;activity&#x27; consisted of those processes &quot;that realize a person&#x27;s actual life in the objective world by which he is surrounded, his social being in all the richness and variety of its forms&quot; (Leontiev 1977). The core of Leontiev&#x27;s work is the proposal that we can examine human processes from the perspective of their psychological macrostructure in three interrelated units. The stimulating unit is that of &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;motives&quot; that drive it. The behavior-orientation unit is that of &quot;actions&quot; and their associated &quot;goals&quot;, and the conditional unit is the analysis of &quot;operations&quot; that serve as &quot;means&quot; for the achievement of actions goals.

<text>The &quot;Courageous&quot; class consisted of three battlecruisers known as &quot;large light cruisers&quot; built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. The class was nominally designed to support the Baltic Project, a plan by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher that was intended to land troops on the German Baltic Coast. Ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured, with only a few heavy guns. They were given a shallow draught, in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war. To maximize their speed, the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class battlecruisers were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers.

The first two ships, and , were commissioned in 1917 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. They participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and were present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later. Their half-sister was designed with a pair of guns, the largest guns ever fitted on a ship of the Royal Navy, but was modified during construction to take a flying-off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette. After some patrols in the North Sea, her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked the Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918.

All three ships were laid up after the war, but were rebuilt into the Courageous-class aircraft carriers during the 1920s. &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; were sunk early in the Second World War and &quot;Furious&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

== Design and description ==
The first two &quot;Courageous&quot;-class battlecruisers were designed in 1915 to meet a set of requirements laid down by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, with his Baltic Project in mind. They were to be large enough to ensure that they could maintain their speed in heavy weather, have a powerful armament and a speed of at least to allow them to outrun enemy light cruisers. Their protection was to be light for a cruiser, with of armour between the waterline and the forecastle deck, anti-torpedo bulges amidships and the machinery as far inboard as possible, protected by triple torpedo bulkheads. Shallow draught was of the utmost importance and all other factors were to be subordinated to this. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Eustace Tennyson-d&#x27;Eyncourt, responded on 23 February 1915 with a smaller version of the s with one less gun turret and reduced armour protection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden any further construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915, so Fisher designated the ships as large light cruisers to evade this prohibition. If this restriction had not been in place, the ships would have been built as improved versions of the preceding &quot;Renown&quot; class. The two ships were laid down a few months later under a veil of secrecy, so they became known in the Royal Navy as &quot;Lord Fisher&#x27;s cruisers&quot; and their odd design also earned them the nickname of the &quot;Outrageous&quot; class.

Their half-sister &quot;Furious&quot; was designed a few months later to meet a revised requirement specifying an armament of two BL 18-inch Mk I guns, the largest guns ever fitted on a Royal Navy ship, in single turrets with the ability to use twin gun turrets if the 18-inch guns were unsatisfactory. Gunnery experts criticized this decision because the long time between salvoes would make spotting corrections useless and reduce the rate of fire and thus the probability of a direct hit. Her secondary armament was upgraded to BL Mk I guns, rather than the guns used by the first two ships, to compensate for the weakness of the two main guns against fast-moving targets like destroyers. Her displacement and beam were increased over that of her half-sisters with slightly less draught.

The Baltic Project was only one justification for the ships. Admiral Fisher wrote in a letter to the DNC on 16 March 1915: &quot;I&#x27;ve told the First Lord that the more that I consider the qualities of your design of the Big Light Battle Cruisers, the more that I am impressed by its exceeding excellence and simplicity—all the three vital requisites of gunpower, speed and draught so well balanced!&quot; In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher&#x27;s belief in the paramount importance of speed over everything else. Fisher&#x27;s adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912–13 Naval Estimates. In the letter, dated April 1912, Fisher stated: &quot;There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT INCREASE IN SPEED ... your speed must vastly exceed [that of] your possible enemy!&quot;

Fisher&#x27;s desire for a shallow draught was not merely based on the need to allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than anticipated and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.

=== General characteristics ===
The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced normally and at deep load. They had a metacentric height of at deep load and a complete double bottom.

Their half-sister &quot;Furious&quot; was the same length, but had a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load. She had a metacentric height of at deep load.

=== Propulsion ===
To save weight and space the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers despite the latter&#x27;s significantly heavier maintenance requirements. Furthermore, to save design time, the turbine installation used in the light cruiser , the navy&#x27;s first cruiser with geared turbines, was simply doubled. The Parsons turbines were arranged in two engine rooms and each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. &quot;Furious&quot;″s propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of , but achieved slightly more than that during &quot;Glorious&quot;″s trials, although she did not reach her designed speed of .

They were designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, they could steam for an estimated at a speed of .

=== Armament ===
The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships mounted four BL 15-inch Mark I guns in two twin hydraulically powered Mark I turrets, one each fore (designated the &#x27;A&#x27; turret) and aft (the &#x27;Y&#x27; turret). These turrets were originally intended for a that was canceled shortly after the war began. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 20°; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20°, although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun&#x27;s return to battery (firing position). The ships carried 120 shells per gun. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing shells.
The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were designed with 18 BL 4-inch Mark IX guns, fitted in six triple mounts. These were manually powered and quite cumbersome in use as they required a crew of thirty-two men to load and train the guns. The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was only 10 to 12 rounds per minute as the loaders kept getting in each other&#x27;s way. They had a maximum depression of −10° and a maximum elevation of 30°. They fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . At maximum elevation the guns had a maximum range of . The ships carried 120 rounds for each gun.

Each ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns on single high-angle Mark II mountings. These were mounted abreast the mainmast in the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships and before the funnel on &quot;Furious&quot;. The gun had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12–14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . All three ships carried ten torpedoes and mounted two  submerged side-loading torpedo tubes fitted near &#x27;A&#x27; turret. They were loaded and traversed by hydraulic power, but fired by compressed air.

The 18-inch BL Mark I gun carried by &quot;Furious&quot; was derived from the 15-inch Mark I gun used in her half-sisters. It was intended to be mounted in two single-gun turrets derived from the twin-gun 15-inch Mark I/N turret, and her barbettes were designed to accommodate either turret in case problems arose with the 18-inch gun&#x27;s development, but only one turret was actually fitted. The gun could depress to −3° and elevate to a maximum of 30°. It fired a , 4 crh armour-piercing, capped shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . It could fire one round per minute and the ship carried sixty rounds of ammunition. The turret&#x27;s revolving mass was , only slightly more than the of its predecessor.

&quot;Furious&quot;″s secondary armament consisted of 11 BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns. The guns had a maximum elevation of 25° on their pivot mounts. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 12 rounds per minute. Their maximum range was at 25° elevation.

=== Fire control ===
The main guns of the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships could be controlled from either of the two fire-control directors. The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore-top on the foremast. The secondary armament was also director-controlled. Each turret was provided with a rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The fore-top was equipped with a rangefinder as was the torpedo control tower above the rear superstructure. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a simple rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure.

=== Protection ===
Unlike on other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships was made from high-tensile steel, a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline belt consisted of covered by a skin. It ran from barbette to barbette with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward bulkhead well short of the bow. The belt had a height of , of which was below the designed waterline. From the forward barbette a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship&#x27;s side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear. After the loss of three battlecruisers to magazine explosions during the Battle of Jutland, of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.

The turrets, barbettes and conning tower were made from Krupp cemented armour. The turret faces were thick while their sides ranged from in thickness and the roof was thick. The barbettes had a maximum thickness of above the main deck, but reduced in thickness to between the lower and main decks. The conning tower armour was thick and it had a three-inch roof. The primary fire-control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood. The face of the hood was six inches thick, its sides were two inches thick and its roof was protected by three inches of armour. A communications tube with three-inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the main deck. The torpedo bulkheads were increased during building from to in thickness.

All three ships were fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent the underwater explosion to the surface rather than into the ship. However, later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task as it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.

== Ships ==
== Service ==
During her sea trials in November 1916 off the River Tyne, &quot;Courageous&quot; sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. In addition, the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical flange of the angle iron securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but &quot;Courageous&quot; received of stiffening in response; &quot;Glorious&quot; did not receive her stiffening until 1918. &quot;Courageous&quot; also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck. &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).

Even as she was being built, &quot;Furious&quot; was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle replacing the forward turret. A 160-foot (49 m) flight deck was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, less successfully, landed on this deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun trialled, it was not long before &quot;Furious&quot; returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917 the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91 m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar. Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks. Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden. Her 18-inch guns were reused on the monitors and during the war.

All three ships were in the 1st CS of which &quot;Courageous&quot; was flagship when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October 1917, possibly indicating some sort of raid. Admiral Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. &quot;Furious&quot; was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4° East and to return before dark. The other two ships were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day. Two German light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy headed to Scandinavia during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be too fast and the British ships were unsuccessful.

=== Second Battle of Heligoland Bight ===
Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st CS covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.

The German ships, four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot;s (cork-filled trawlers, used to detonate mines without sinking) and two trawlers to mark the swept route, were spotted at 7:30 a.m., silhouetted by the rising sun. &quot;Courageous&quot; and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. One 15-inch hit was made on a gun shield of , but it did not affect her speed. At 8:33 the left-hand gun in &quot;Glorious&quot;″s forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel. At 9:30 the 1st CS broke off their pursuit so they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps; the ships turned south, playing no further role in the battle. The German ships had too much of a lead to be caught by the British ships before they had to turn to avoid the minefield.

Both ships had taken minor damage from their own muzzle blasts, and &quot;Glorious&quot; required five days of repairs. &quot;Courageous&quot; fired 92 rounds of 15-inch while &quot;Glorious&quot; fired 57, scoring only the single hit on &quot;Pillau&quot; between them. They also fired 180 and 213 four-inch shells respectively. &quot;Courageous&quot;″s mine fittings were removed after the battle and both ships received flying-off platforms on top of their turrets in 1918. A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on the forward turret.

&quot;Furious&quot; was recommissioned on 15 March 1918 and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918 she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid, attacking the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern with moderate success. All three ships were present at the surrender of the German fleet on 21 November 1918.

=== Post-war history ===
&quot;Courageous&quot; was reduced to at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 before being assigned to the Gunnery School at Devonport the following year as a turret drill ship. She became flagship of the Rear-Admiral Commanding the Reserve at Devonport in March 1920. &quot;Glorious&quot; was also reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February and served as a turret-drill ship, but succeeded her sister as flagship between 1921 and 1922. &quot;Furious&quot; was placed in reserve 21 November 1919 before beginning reconstruction as an aircraft carrier in 1921.

The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 required the signatory nations to severely curtail their plans for new warships and scrap many existing warships to meet its tonnage limits. Up to of existing ships, however, could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy chose to convert the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships because of their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck during the 1920s. Their 15-inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during the Second World War for , the Royal Navy&#x27;s last battleship.

As the first large, or &quot;fleet&quot;, carrier completed by the Royal Navy, &quot;Furious&quot; was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first ever carrier night-landing in 1926. &quot;Courageous&quot; became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War II when she was torpedoed in September 1939. &quot;Glorious&quot; unsuccessfully hunted the in the Indian Ocean in 1939. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, but was sunk by the German battleships and on 8 June 1940 in the North Sea. &quot;Furious&quot; spent the first months of the war hunting for German raiders and escorting convoys before she began to support British forces in Norway. She spent most of 1940 in Norwegian waters making attacks on German installations and shipping, and most of 1941 ferrying aircraft to West Africa, Gibraltar and Malta before refitting in the United States. She ferried aircraft to Malta during 1942 and provided air support to British forces during Operation Torch. &quot;Furious&quot; spent most of 1943 training with the Home Fleet, but made numerous air strikes against the and other targets in Norway in 1944. She was worn out by late 1944 and was reduced to reserve in September before being decommissioned the following year. &quot;Furious&quot; was sold in 1948 for scrap.

<text>Activity theory (AT; ) is an umbrella term for a line of eclectic social-sciences theories and research with its roots in the Soviet psychological activity theory pioneered by Sergei Rubinstein in the 1930s. It was later advocated for and popularized by Alexei Leont&#x27;ev. Some of the traces of the theory in its inception can also be found in a few works of Lev Vygotsky. These scholars sought to understand human activities as systemic and socially situated phenomena and to go beyond paradigms of reflexology (the teaching of Vladimir Bekhterev and his followers) and classical conditioning (the teaching of Ivan Pavlov and his school), psychoanalysis and behaviorism. It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former USSR, being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, and in education, professional training, ergonomics, social psychology and work psychology.

Activity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory. It considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or &quot;activity system&quot;. This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. The motive for the activity in AT is created through the tensions and contradictions within the elements of the system. According to ethnographer Bonnie Nardi, a leading theorist in AT, activity theory &quot;focuses on practice, which obviates the need to distinguish &#x27;applied&#x27; from &#x27;pure&#x27; science—understanding everyday practice in the real world is the very objective of scientific practice. ... The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity.&quot; Sometimes called &quot;Cultural-Historical Activity Theory&quot;, this approach is particularly useful for studying a group that exists &quot;largely in virtual form, its communications mediated largely through electronic and printed texts.&quot; Cultural-Historical Activity Theory has accordingly also been applied to genre theory within writing studies to consider how quasi-stabilized forms of communication regularize relations and work while forming communally shared knowledge and values in both educational and workplace settings. 

AT is particularly useful as a lens in qualitative research methodologies (e.g., ethnography, case study). AT provides a method of understanding and analyzing a phenomenon, finding patterns and making inferences across interactions, describing phenomena and presenting phenomena through a built-in language and rhetoric. A particular activity is a goal-directed or purposeful interaction of a subject with an object through the use of tools. These tools are exteriorized forms of mental processes manifested in constructs, whether physical or psychological. As a result the notion of tools in AT is broad and can involve stationary, digital devices, library materials, or even physical meeting spaces. AT recognizes the internalization and externalization of cognitive processes involved in the use of tools, as well as the transformation or development that results from the interaction.

==History==
The origins of activity theory can be traced to several sources, which have subsequently given rise to various complementary and intertwined strands of development. This account will focus on three of the most important of these strands. The first is associated with the Moscow Institute of Psychology and in particular the &quot;troika&quot; of young Russian researchers, Vygotsky, Leont&#x27;ev and Luria. Vygotsky founded cultural-historical psychology, a field that became the basis for modern AT; Leont&#x27;ev, one of the principal founders of activity theory, both developed and reacted against Vygotsky&#x27;s work. Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s formulation of general activity theory is currently a strong influence in post-Soviet developments in AT, which have largely been in social-scientific, organizational, and writing-studies rather than psychological research and organization.

The second major line of development within activity theory involves Russian scientists, such as P. K. Anokhin and Nikolai Bernstein, more directly concerned with the neurophysiological basis of activity; its foundation is associated with the Soviet philosopher of psychology Sergei Rubinstein. This work was subsequently developed by researchers such as Pushkin, Zinchenko &amp; Gordeeva, Ponomarenko, Zarakovsky and others, and is currently most well-known through the work on systemic-structural activity theory being carried out by G. Z. Bedny and his associates, including a focus on the application of this theory as well as other related theories.

Finally, in the Western world, discussions and use of AT are primarily framed within the Scandinavian activity theory strand, developed by Yrjö Engeström.

===Russian===
After Vygotsky&#x27;s early death, Leont&#x27;ev became the leader of the research group nowadays known as the Kharkov School of Psychology and extended Vygotsky&#x27;s research framework in significantly new ways. Leont&#x27;ev first examined the psychology of animals, looking at the different degrees to which animals can be said to have mental processes. He concluded that Pavlov&#x27;s reflexionism was not a sufficient explanation of animal behaviour and that animals have an active relation to reality, which he called &quot;activity&quot;. In particular, the behaviour of higher primates such as chimpanzees could only be explained by the ape&#x27;s formation of multi-phase plans using tools.

Leont&#x27;ev then progressed to humans and pointed out that people engage in &quot;actions&quot; that do not in themselves satisfy a need, but contribute towards the eventual satisfaction of a need. Often, these actions only make sense in a social context of a shared work activity. This led him to a distinction between &quot;activities&quot;, which satisfy a need, and the &quot;actions&quot; that constitute the activities. Leont&#x27;ev also argued that the activity in which a person is involved is reflected in their mental activity, that is (as he puts it) material reality is &quot;presented&quot; to consciousness, but only in its vital meaning or significance.

Activity theory also influenced the development of organizational-activity game as developed by Georgy Shchedrovitsky.

===Scandinavian===
AT remained virtually unknown outside the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s, when it was picked up by Scandinavian researchers. The first international conference on activity theory was not held until 1986. The earliest non-Soviet paper cited by Nardi is a 1987 paper by Yrjö Engeström: &quot;Learning by expanding&quot;. This resulted in a reformulation of AT. Kuutti notes that the term &quot;activity theory&quot; &quot;can be used in two senses: referring to the original Soviet tradition or referring to the international, multi-voiced community applying the original ideas and developing them further.&quot;

The Scandinavian AT school of thought seeks to integrate and develop concepts from Vygotsky&#x27;s Cultural-historical psychology and Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s activity theory with Western intellectual developments such as Cognitive Science, American Pragmatism, Constructivism, and Actor-Network Theory. It is known as Scandinavian activity theory. Work in the systems-structural theory of activity is also being carried on by researchers in the US and UK.

Some of the changes are a systematisation of Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s work. Although Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s exposition is clear and well structured, it is not as well-structured as the formulation by Yrjö Engeström. Kaptelinin remarks that Engeström &quot;proposed a scheme of activity different from that by Leont&#x27;ev; it contains three interacting entities—the individual, the object and the community—instead of the two components—the individual and the object—in Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s original scheme.&quot;

Some changes were introduced, apparently by importing notions from human–computer interaction theory. For instance, the notion of &quot;rules&quot;, which is not found in Leont&#x27;ev, was introduced. Also, the notion of collective subject was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s (Leont&#x27;ev refers to &quot;joint labour activity&quot;, but only has individuals, not groups, as activity subjects).

==Theory==
The goal of activity theory is understanding the mental capabilities of a single individual. However, it rejects the &quot;isolated&quot; individuals as insufficient unit of analysis, analyzing the cultural and technical aspects of human actions.

Activity theory is most often used to describe actions in a socio-technical system through six related elements (Bryant et al. as defined by Leonti&#x27;ev 1981 and redefined in Engeström 1987) of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories:
* Object-orientedness – the objective of the activity system. Object refers to the objectiveness of the reality; items are considered objective according to natural sciences but also have social and cultural properties.
* Subject or internalization – actors engaged in the activities; the traditional notion of mental processes
* Community or externalization – social context; all actors involved in the activity system
* Tools or tool mediation – the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in the system (both material and abstract artifacts). Tools influence actor-structure interactions, they change with accumulating experience. In addition to physical shape, the knowledge also evolves. Tools are influenced by culture, and their use is a way for the accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tools influence both the agents and the structure.
* Division of labor – social strata, hierarchical structure of activity, the division of activities among actors in the system
* Rules – conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the system

Activity theory helps explain how social artifacts and social organization mediate social action (Bryant et al.).

==Information systems==
The application of activity theory to information systems derives from the work of Bonnie Nardi and Kari Kuutti. Kuutti&#x27;s work is addressed below. Nardi&#x27;s approach is, briefly, as follows: Nardi (p. 6) described activity theory as &quot;...a powerful and clarifying descriptive tool rather than a strongly predictive theory. The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity...Activity theorists argue that consciousness is not a set of discrete disembodied cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering), and certainly it is not the brain; rather, consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do.&quot; Nardi (p. 5) also argued that &quot;activity theory proposes a strong notion of &quot;mediation&quot;—all human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use.&quot; Nardi (p. 6) explained that &quot;a basic tenet of activity theory is that a notion of consciousness is central to a depiction of activity. Vygotsky described consciousness as a phenomenon that unifies attention, intention, memory, reasoning, and speech...&quot; and (p. 7) &quot;Activity theory, with its emphasis on the importance of motive and consciousness—which belongs only to humans—sees people and things as fundamentally different. People are not reduced to &#x27;nodes&#x27; or &#x27;agents&#x27; in a system; &#x27;information processing&#x27; is not seen as something to be modelled in the same way for people and machines.&quot;

In a later work, Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that &quot;activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness&quot; and therefore &quot;... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including
remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools.&quot; For Activity Theorists &quot;consciousness&quot; seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.

Over the last 15 years the use and exploration of activity theory in information systems has grown. One stream of research has focused on technology mediated change and the implementation of technologies and how they disrupt, change and improve organisational work activity. In these studies, activity systems are used to understand emergent contradictions in the work activity, which are temporarily resolved using information systems (tools) and/or arising from the introduction of information systems. Information science studies use a similar approach to activity theory in order to understand information behaviour &quot;in context&quot;.

In the field of Information and communications technology (ICT) and development (a field of study within information systems), activity theory has also been used to inform development of IT systems and to frame the study of ICT in development settings.

In addition, Etengoff &amp; Daiute have conducted recent work exploring how social media interfaces can be productively used to mediate conflicts. Their work has illustrated this perspective with analyses of online interactions between gay men and their religious family members and Sunni-Muslim emerging adults&#x27; efforts to maintain a positive ethnic identity via online religious forums in post 9/11 contexts.

==Human–computer interaction==
The rise of the personal computer challenged the focus in traditional systems developments on mainframe systems for automation of existing work routines. It furthermore brought forth a need to focus on how to work on materials and objects through the computer. In the search of theoretical and methodical perspectives suited to deal with issues of flexibility and more advanced mediation between the human being, material and outcomes through the interface, it seemed promising to turn to the still rather young HCI research tradition that had emerged primarily in the US (for further discussion see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991).

Specifically the cognitive science-based theories lacked means of addressing a number of issues that came out of the empirical projects (see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991): 1. Many of the early advanced user interfaces assumed that the users were the designers themselves, and accordingly built on an assumption of a generic user, without concern for qualifications, work environment, division of work, etc. 2.In particular the role of the artifact as it stands between the user and her materials, objects and outcomes was ill understood. 3. In validating findings and designs there was a heavy focus on novice users whereas everyday use by experienced users and concerns for the development of expertise were hardly addressed. 4.Detailed task analysis and the idealized models created through task analysis failed to capture the complexity and contingency of real-life action. 5.From the point of view of complex work settings, it was striking how most HCI focused on one user – one computer in contrast to the ever-ongoing cooperation and coordination of real work situations (this problem later lead to the development of CSCW). 6.Users were mainly seen as objects of study.

Because of these shortcomings, it was necessary to move outside cognitive science-based HCI to find or develop the necessary theoretical platform. European psychology had taken different paths than had American with much inspiration from dialectical materialism (Hydén 1981, Engeström, 1987). Philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein came to play an important role, primarily through discussions of the limitations of AI (Winograd &amp; Flores 1986, Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus 1986). Suchman (1987) with a similar focus introduced ethnomethodology into the discussions, and Ehn (1988) based his treatise of design of computer artifacts on Marx, Heidegger and Wittgenstein.
The development of the activity theoretical angle was primarily carried out by Bødker (1991, 1996) and by Kuutti (Bannon &amp; Kuutti, 1993, Kuutti, 1991, 1996), both with strong inspiration from Scandinavian activity theory groups in psychology. Bannon (1990, 1991) and Grudin (1990a and b) made significant contributions to the furthering of the approach by making it available to the HCI audience. The work of Kaptelinin (1996) has been important to connect to the earlier development of activity theory in Russia. Nardi produced the, hitherto, most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature (Nardi, 1996).

===Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)===
At the end of the 1990s, a group of Russian and American activity theorists working in the systems-cybernetic tradition of Bernshtein and Anokhin began to publish English-language articles and books dealing with topics in human factors and ergonomics and, latterly, human–computer interaction. Under the rubric of systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT), this work represents a modern synthesis within activity theory which brings together the cultural-historical and systems-structural strands of the tradition (as well as other work within Soviet psychology such as the Psychology of Set) with findings and methods from Western human factors/ergonomics and cognitive psychology.

The development of SSAT has been specifically oriented toward the analysis and design of the basic elements of human work activity: tasks, tools, methods, objects and results, and the skills, experience and abilities of involved subjects. SSAT has developed techniques for both the qualitative and quantitative description of work activity. Its design-oriented analyses specifically focus on the interrelationship between the structure and self-regulation of work activity and the configuration of its material components.

==An explanation==
This section presents a short introduction to activity theory, and some brief comments on human creativity in activity theory and the implications of activity theory for tacit knowledge and learning.

===Activities===
Activity theory begins with the notion of activity. An activity is seen as a system of human &quot;doing&quot; whereby a subject works on an object in order to obtain a desired outcome. In order to do this, the subject employs tools, which may be external (e.g. an axe, a computer) or internal (e.g. a plan). As an illustration, an activity might be the operation of an automated call centre. As we shall see later, many subjects may be involved in the activity and each subject may have one or more motives (e.g. improved supply management, career advancement or gaining control over a vital organisational power source). A simple example of an activity within a call centre might be a telephone operator (subject) who is modifying a customer&#x27;s billing record (object) so that the billing data is correct (outcome) using a graphical front end to a database (tool).

Kuutti formulates activity theory in terms of the structure of an activity. &quot;An activity is a form of doing directed to an object, and activities are distinguished from each other according
to their objects. Transforming the object into an outcome motivates the existence of an activity. An object can be a material thing, but it can also be less tangible.&quot;

Kuutti then adds a third term, the tool, which &#x27;mediates&#x27; between the activity and the object. &quot;The tool is at the same time both enabling and limiting: it empowers the subject in the transformation process with the historically collected experience and skill &#x27;crystallised&#x27; to it, but it also restricts the interaction to be from the perspective of that particular tool or instrument; other potential features of an object remain invisible to the subject...&quot;.

As Verenikina remarks, tools are &quot;social objects with certain modes of operation developed socially in the course of labour and are only possible because they correspond to the objectives of a practical action.&quot;

===Levels===
An activity is modelled as a three-level hierarchy. Kuutti schematises processes in activity theory as a three-level system.

Verenikina paraphrases Leont&#x27;ev as explaining that &quot;the non-coincidence of action and operations... appears in actions with tools, that is, material objects which are crystallised operations, not actions nor goals. If a person is confronted with a specific goal of, say, dismantling a machine, then they must make use of a variety of operations; it makes no difference how the individual operations were learned because the formulation of the operation proceeds differently to the formulation of the goal that initiated the action.&quot;

The levels of activity are also characterised by their purposes: &quot;Activities are oriented to motives, that is, the objects that are impelling by themselves. Each motive is an object, material or ideal, that satisfies a need. Actions are the processes functionally subordinated to activities; they are directed at specific conscious goals... Actions are realised through operations that are determined by the actual conditions of activity.&quot;

Engeström developed an extended model of an activity, which adds another component, community (&quot;those who share the same object&quot;), and then adds rules to mediate between subject and community, and the division of labour to mediate between object and community.

Kuutti asserts that &quot;These three classes should be understood broadly. A tool can be anything used in the transformation process, including both material tools and tools for thinking. Rules cover both explicit and implicit norms, conventions, and social relations within a community. Division of labour refers to the explicit and implicit organisation of the community as related to the transformation process of the object into the outcome.&quot;

Activity theory therefore includes the notion that an activity is carried out within a social context, or specifically in a community. The way in which the activity fits into the context is thus established by two resulting concepts:
* rules: these are both explicit and implicit and define how subjects must fit into the community;
* division of labour: this describes how the object of the activity relates to the community.

===The internal plane of action===
Activity theory provides a number of useful concepts that can be used to address the lack of expression for &#x27;soft&#x27; factors which are inadequately represented by most process modelling frameworks. One such concept is the internal plane of action. Activity theory recognises that each activity takes place in two planes: the external plane and the internal plane. The external plane represents the objective components of the action while the internal plane represents the subjective components of the action. Kaptelinin defines the &quot;internal plane of actions&quot; as &quot;[...] a concept developed in activity theory that refers to the human ability to perform manipulations with an internal representation of external objects before starting actions with these objects in reality.&quot;

The concepts of motives, goals and conditions discussed above also contribute to the modelling of soft factors. One principle of activity theory is that many activities have multiple motivation (&#x27;polymotivation&#x27;). For instance, a programmer in writing a program may address goals aligned towards multiple motives such as increasing his or her annual bonus, obtaining relevant career experience and contributing to organisational objectives.

Activity theory further argues that subjects are grouped into communities, with rules mediating between subject and community and a division of labour mediating between object and community. A subject may be part of several communities and a community, itself, may be part of other communities.

===Human creativity===
Human creativity plays an important role in activity theory, that &quot;human beings... are essentially creative beings&quot; in &quot;the creative, non-predictable character&quot;. Tikhomirov also analyses the importance of &quot;creative activity&quot;, contrasting it to &quot;routine&quot; activity, and notes the important shift brought about by computerisation in the balance towards creative activity.

Karl Marx, a sociological theorist, argued that humans are unique compared to other species in that humans create everything they need to survive. According to Marx, this is described as species-being. Marx believed we find our true identity in what we produce in our personal labor.

===Learning and tacit knowledge===
Activity theory has an interesting approach to the difficult problems of &quot;learning&quot; and, in particular, &quot;tacit knowledge&quot;. Learning has been a favourite subject of management theorists, but it has often been presented in an abstract way separated from the work processes to which the learning should apply. Activity theory provides a potential corrective to this tendency. For instance, Engeström&#x27;s review of Nonaka&#x27;s work on &quot;knowledge creation&quot; suggests enhancements based on activity theory, in particular suggesting that the organisational learning process includes preliminary stages of goal and problem formation not found in Nonaka. Lompscher, rather than seeing learning as &quot;transmission&quot;, sees the formation of learning goals and the
student&#x27;s understanding of which things they need to acquire as the key to the formation of the learning activity.

Of particular importance to the study of learning in organisations is the problem of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot;, which according to Nonaka, &quot;is highly personal and hard to formalise, making it difficult to communicate to others or to share with others.&quot; Leont&#x27;ev&#x27;s concept of operation provides an important insight into this problem. In addition, the key idea of &quot;internalisation&quot; was originally introduced by Vygotsky as &quot;the internal reconstruction of an external operation.&quot; Internalisation has subsequently become a key term of the theory of tacit knowledge and has been defined as &quot;a process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge.&quot; Internalisation has been described by Engeström as the &quot;key psychological mechanism&quot; discovered by Vygotsky and is further discussed by Verenikina.

<text>Antonio Maceo Airport is an international airport located in Santiago, Cuba.

==Overview==
The airport has a drawing of Che Guevara on one of its outside walls. Pope John Paul II flew to this airport during his last visit to Cuba, flying a round trip between here and José Martí International Airport in Havana. Likewise, Pope Benedict XVI, during the second papal visit to Cuba, flew here for Mass and other activities, from his visit to León and Guanajuato in Mexico, before moving on to Havana.

The airport was home to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, which had stationed Antonov An-2, Antonov An-26, Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-24 aircraft here. The helipads are now part of the executive jet terminal on the north end of the airport.

The airport is mostly used by turbo-prop aircraft. Nevertheless, jet aircraft also serve this airport. Most commercial flights were at one point domestic, but there are about twenty international flights each week; while these international flights were at one point done mostly by domestic airlines, the international routes have nevertheless awakened the interest of some foreign airlines that have opened flights into this airport and might open more flights in the future.

==Airlines and destinations==
==Accidents and incidents==
* On 13 June 1929, a Fokker F.10A (NC9700) of Pan Am crashed on takeoff for Havana at 08:00, killing 2 of the 5 occupants. This was Cuba&#x27;s first fatal airliner crash.
* On 10 April 1959, a Douglas DC-3 (registration unknown) of Compagnie Haitienne de Transports Aériens (COHATA) was hijacked on a passenger flight from Les Cayes to Port-au-Prince by 6 rebels who killed the captain and forced the co-pilot to fly to Cuba, the plane was then was landed in Santiago.
* On 2 October 1959, a Viscount of Cubana de Aviación was hijacked on a flight from Havana to Antonio Maceo Airport, Santiago de Cuba by three men demanding to be taken to the United States. The aircraft landed at the Miami International Airport.
* On 27 March 1962, an Ilyushin Il-14 (CU-T819) on Cubana de Aviacion Flight 853 to Havana crashed into the sea during initial climb at 20:00, 1.6 km (1 mile) from here, killing all 22 occupants.
* On 23 March 1990, an Antonov An-26 (CU-T1436) on Cubana de Aviacion Flight 7406 overran the runway after aborting takeoff, killing 4 passengers of the 46 occupants.
* On 24 October 1990, a Yakovlev Yak-40S2 (CU-T1202) on Cubana de Aviacion Flight 2886 from Camaguey crashed into mountainous terrain at 01:58 4 km (2.5 miles) east of the runway at 94 m (308 feet) on approach, killing 11 of the 31 occupants. The crew attempted the landing visually in instrument-only weather conditions.
* On 11 July 1997, an Antonov An-24RV (CU-T1262) on Cubana de Aviacion Flight 787 to Havana crashed at 21:56 due to loss of control during the initial climb 5 km (3.1 miles) off the airport over the sea, killing all 44 occupants.
* On 4 November 2010, Aero Caribbean Flight 883, an ATR 72-212, crashed in the centre of the country with 68 people on board. The aircraft was flying from Santiago de Cuba to Havana when it went down. 28 foreigners were reported to be among the passengers. There were no survivors.

<doc id="628454" wikidata="Q549603" url="?curid=628454" title="Israel Shamir">
<text>Israel Shamir (Russian: Исраэль Шамир, ; born 1947 or 1948), also known by the names Robert David, Vassili Krasevsky, Jöran Jermas and Adam Ermash, is a Swedish writer and journalist, known for his ties to WikiLeaks and for promoting antisemitism and Holocaust denial. His son Johannes Wahlström is a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Sweden.

Shamir has published or self-published a number of his books; his book &quot;Flowers of Galilee&quot; (2004) was banned for a time in France over allegations it was inciting racial hatred and antisemitism.

==Background and personal life==
Shamir says that he was born in a Jewish family in Russia, and converted to Orthodox Christianity. By his own account, his birth name was Izrail Schmerler. Shamir says that he was born in Novosibirsk, Siberia, in 1947, although the &quot;Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; says that a man called Schmerler was born in 1948. Shamir says that he &quot;studied mathematics and law at Novosibirsk University&quot;. He also says he moved to Israel in 1969. He claimed to have served in the Israeli Paratroopers Brigade and fought in the Yom Kippur War. He also claimed to have worked for the BBC and to have translated the works of Shai Agnon from Hebrew into Russian. Norman Finkelstein told &quot;Tablet&quot; that Shamir is a &quot;maniac&quot; who &quot;has invented his entire personal history. Nothing he says about himself is true&quot;.

&quot;Searchlight&quot; describes him as a &quot;Swedish anti-semite&quot;, and says that he was registered in Sweden in 1984 and gained Swedish citizenship in 1992. Shamir says he left Sweden for Russia and then Israel in 1993, before returning in 1998, saying that he had remarried in Israel in July 1994. However, others argue that Swedish files show that he was married in Sweden. He was known as Jöran Jermas from 2001 to 2005, before changing his name to Adam Ermash, although continuing to use Israel Shamir as a pen name.

==Career==
Shamir says that he went to Russia and wrote about the political changes in the country until 1993, for newspapers including &quot;Pravda&quot; and the extreme nationalist &quot;Zavtra&quot;.

The French edition of Shamir&#x27;s &quot;Flowers of Galilee&quot; was originally co-published in October 2003 by Éditions Blanche and Éditions Balland. It was withdrawn from sale at the end of October after Balland&#x27;s director had his attention drawn to the content of the book, which he considered anti-semitic. The book was republished in 2004 by the French Islamist Éditions Al-Qalam company, which led to a civil case brought by the &quot;Ligue internationale contre le racisme et l&#x27;antisémitisme&quot; (LICRA), with the publisher sentenced to three months in prison (suspended) and a 10,000-euro fine, and the banning of the book. The ban was overturned on appeal, and the fine reduced.

In 2005, Shamir was featured as a speaker in the &quot;Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization&quot; conference co-chaired by David Duke in Ukraine, and sponsored by the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management which has been associated with antisemitic discourse in Eastern Europe.

== Allegations of antisemitism and Holocaust denial ==
According to the scholar of antisemitism , Shamir borrows from neo-Nazi terminology when describing an alleged &quot;Zionist&quot; conspiracy to bring about the Iraq War. Bachner has said that Shamir&#x27;s writing would have been of little interest had they been published only on his website, however, &quot;Flowers of Galilee&quot; was issued by a respected publisher and promoted by parts of the left in Sweden. The book was recommended by former Swedish MP Evert Svensson and promoted by The Palestine Solidarity Association in Sweden which also engaged Shamir as speaker. In &quot;Cabbala of Power&quot;, Shamir writes: &quot;The Jewish &#x27;plan&#x27; is no secret; there is no need to re-read &quot;The Protocols&quot; or to ask Jews what they want.&quot;

Henrik Bachner, described Shamir&#x27;s online outlet as &quot;a multilingual website in which Jewish conspiracies are brought forward as an explanation for both historical and contemporary world events&quot;. Stephen Pollard reported in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2005 that it included such statements as &quot;Jews asked God to kill, destroy, humiliate, exterminate, defame, starve, impale Christians, to usher in Divine Vengeance and to cover God’s mantle with blood of goyim.&quot; The Anti-Defamation League reported in 2006 that Shamir had written on his website of &quot;accumulating evidence of Israeli Connection&quot; for 9/11 and wrote of the United States and Israel creating the attacks to carry out anti-Muslim policies. He had expressed his belief in the &quot;blood libel&quot; on his website.

In 2004, &quot;Searchlight&quot; wrote about his connections to antisemitic publications and groups, and the campaign Hope not Hate has listed Shamir as a &quot;notable Holocaust denier,&quot; citing the &quot;rabid Holocaust denial material&quot; on his website. At an event at the British Houses of Parliament in 2005, Shamir claimed &quot;Jews indeed own, control and edit a big share of mass media&quot; and said US foreign policy in the Middle East was a &quot;fight for ensuring Jewish supremacy&quot;. 

In 2006, discussing the upcoming Iranian International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; wrote that the Iranian government &quot;said it intended to invite academics such as German neo-Nazi [lawyer] Horst Mahler and the Israeli journalist and Christian convert Israel Shamir, both of whom are Holocaust deniers.&quot;

In December 2010, Shamir&#x27;s connection with WikiLeaks brought him more public attention. Katha Pollitt, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot; in December 2010, described Shamir&#x27;s web site: I spent a few hours on www.israelshamir.net and learned that: &quot;the Jews&quot; foisted capitalism, advertising and consumerism on harmonious and modest Christian Europe; were behind Stalin&#x27;s famine in Ukraine; control the banks, the media and many governments; and that &quot;Palestine is not the ultimate goal of the Jews; the world is.&quot; There are numerous guest articles by Holocaust deniers, aka &quot;historical revisionists.&quot;

In early 2011, David Leigh and Luke Harding, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described Shamir as being &quot;notorious for Holocaust denial and publishing a string of antisemitic articles.&quot; The &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; called him &quot;an avowed Holocaust-denier&quot; who said of the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust that it &quot;proved that the Holocaust dogma is a basic tenet in the great world-embracing brainwashing machine of mass media&quot;. Shamir denied the accusation of Holocaust denial in an article for &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, writing that his family &quot;lost too many of its sons and daughters for me to deny the facts of Jewish tragedy&quot; but that he denies &quot;the morbid cult of Holocaust&quot;. In his 2011 &quot;Tablet&quot; interview, Shamir referred to &quot;perceptions during the war&quot; of Auschwitz as a &quot;quite awful deportation camp&quot; whereas &quot;after the war, different perception came. And that was a perception of mass annihilation, and mass murder, and all that.&quot; Asked which &quot;perception&quot; was true, Shamir said he had no interest in the subject. When asked if the concentration camps were used for mass murder, he responded by saying he had &quot;no knowledge about it at all&quot; and rejected &quot;the idea that it is important.&quot;

==Association with WikiLeaks==
Shamir is a vocal backer of the WikiLeaks organization and has described his relation with WikiLeaks as being &quot;a freelancer who was &#x27;accredited&#x27; to WikiLeaks&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he invoiced WikiLeaks for €2,000 for &quot;journalism&quot;. Shamir&#x27;s son Johannes Wahlström is a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Sweden. 

In a 2010 Sveriges Radio interview with WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, Hrafnsson stated that Israel Shamir &quot;is associated with&quot; WikiLeaks, as are &quot;a lot of journalists that are working with us all around the world&quot; who &quot;have different roles in working on [the] project&quot;. In an article by Andrew Brown published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; during December 2010 Hrafnsson was quoted as saying Shamir was WikiLeaks representative in Russia. By February 2011, former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg said WikiLeaks&#x27; ties to Shamir were among the reasons he quit the organization. He described Shamir as a &quot;famous Holocaust denier and anti-Semite.&quot; By May 2011, a statement had appeared on the WikiLeaks website that Shamir had &quot;never worked or volunteered for WikiLeaks, in any manner, whatsoever. He has never written for WikiLeaks or any associated organization, under any name and we have no plan that he do so.&quot; James Ball wrote in 2013 he was aware the organization&#x27;s later denial of its connections to Shamir were untrue because Julian Assange had instructed him to give Shamir 90,000 US cables.

According to the Associated Press, leaked documents from WikiLeaks include an unsigned letter from Julian Assange authorising Israel Shamir to seek a Russian visa on his behalf in 2010. WikiLeaks said Assange never applied for the visa or wrote the letter. According to the New York Times, Russia issued Assange the visa in January 2011. Israel Shamir was the original source for some conspiracy theories about Swedish allegations against Assange. 

===Diplomatic cables===
In an article published by the &quot;CounterPunch&quot; website in December 2010, Shamir praised the Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko and said WikiLeaks had exposed America&#x27;s &quot;agents&quot; in the country. Shamir has been reported to have passed &quot;sensitive cables&quot; to the Lukashenko government. He is believed to have visited Belarus in December 2010 and to have given Vladimir Makei, then Lukashenko&#x27;s chief of staff, unpublished and unredacted US diplomatic cables. 

Former WikiLeaks staff member James Ball wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; contacted him less than a fortnight after Shamir left WikiLeaks headquarters (then in Norfolk) with a photograph of Shamir leaving the Belarus interior ministry. According to Ball, soon afterwards Lukashenko announced a Belarusian WikiLeaks would be released to show opposition leaders in the country were on the American payroll and thus effectively grounds for their arrest. &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; later expressed concern that such a development could physically endanger Lukashenko&#x27;s political opponents. WikiLeaks responded that &quot;We have no further reports on this &#x27;rumour/issue&#x27;&quot;, although another WikiLeaks representative called Shamir&#x27;s alleged leaks &quot;obviously unapproved.&quot;

&quot;Russian Reporter&quot; claimed it had &quot;privileged access&quot; to the 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak via Shamir.&quot; Soviet Belarus&quot;, a state-run newspaper began publishing what it claimed were WikiLeaks cables given to Lukashenko by Shamir in January 2011. A request from Shamir, according to Ball, was for all cables relating to &quot;the Jews&quot;; it was refused. Elsewhere, Shamir claimed to have received &quot;thousands of cables about the Jews.&quot; Ball said that a Russian reporter wrote WikiLeaks saying that Shamir was answering requests for access to cables about Russia with requests for money, saying they couldn&#x27;t look through the cables themselves.

Yulia Latynina, writing in &quot;The Moscow Times,&quot; alleged that Shamir concocted a cable which allegedly quoted European Union diplomats&#x27; plans to walk out of the Durban II speech by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for publication in the pro-Putin &quot;Russian Reporter&quot; in December 2010. Shamir has denied this accusation, though he has described Ahmadinejad as being a &quot;brave and charismatic leader&quot; on his website.

In 2011, Shamir posted unredacted copies of diplomatic cables dealing with former Soviet states that hinted at the names of State Department sources that &quot;The Guardian&quot; and WikiLeaks had redacted. When asked why he published the unredacted cables, possibly putting the sources at risk, Shamir said &quot;Handing confidential and secret information to everybody is the thing of Wikileaks. That’s what it is about. Your question is like asking police why they catch thieves. That is what they are for.&quot;

<doc id="628463" wikidata="Q3830209" url="?curid=628463" title="Kerr-lens modelocking">
<text>Kerr-lens mode-locking (KLM) is a method of mode-locking lasers via the nonlinear optical Kerr effect. This method allows the generation of pulses of light with a duration as short as a few femtoseconds.

The optical Kerr effect is a process which results from the nonlinear response of an optical medium to the electric field of an electromagnetic wave. The refractive index of the medium is dependent on the field strength.
Because of the non-uniform power density distribution in a Gaussian beam (as found in laser resonators) the refractive index changes across the beam profile; the refractive index experienced by the beam is greater in the center of the beam than at the edge. Thus a rod of an active Kerr medium functions as a lens for high intensity light. This is called self-focusing and in extreme cases leads to material destruction. In the laser cavity short bursts of light will then be focused differently from continuous waves.

To favor the pulsed mode over continuous-wave, the cavity could be made unstable for continuous-wave operation, but more often a low stability is a by-product of a cavity design putting emphasis on aperture effects. Older designs used a hard aperture, that simply cuts off, while modern designs use a soft aperture, that means the overlap between the pumped region of the gain medium and the pulse. While the effect of a lens on a free laser beam is quite obvious, inside a cavity the whole beam tries to adapt to this change. The standard cavity with flat mirrors and a thermal lens in the laser crystal has the smallest beam width on the end-mirrors. With the additional Kerr lens the width on the end-mirror gets even smaller. Therefore, small end-mirrors (hard aperture) favor pulses. In Ti:Sapphire oscillators telescopes are inserted around the crystal to increase the intensity.

For a soft aperture consider an infinite laser crystal with a thermal lens. A laser beam is guided like in a glass fiber. With an additional Kerr lens the beam width gets smaller. In a real laser the crystal is finite. The cavity on both sides features a concave mirror and then a relative long path to a flat mirror. The continuous-wave light exits the crystal end face with a larger beam width and slight divergence. It illuminates a smaller area on the concave mirror, leading to a small beam-width on the way to the flat mirror. Thus diffraction is stronger. Because of the divergence the light is effectively coming from a point farther apart and leads to more convergence after the concave mirror. This convergence is balanced with diffraction. The pulsed light exits the end face with a smaller beam width and no divergence. Thus it illuminates a larger area on the concave mirror and is less convergent afterwards. So both continuous waves and pulsed light fronts are mirrored back onto themselves. A cavity close to a confocal one means to be close to instability, which means the beam diameter is sensitive to cavity changes. This emphasizes the modulation. With a slightly asymmetric cavity prolonging the cavity emphasizes diffraction and even makes it unstable for continuous-wave operation, while staying stable for pulsed operation.
The length of the medium used for KLM is limited by group velocity dispersion. KLM is used in Carrier envelope offset control.

== Starting a Kerr-lens modelocked laser ==
Initiation of Kerr-lens modelocking depends on the strength of the nonlinear effect involved. If the laser field builds up in a cavity the laser has to overcome the region of continuous-wave operation, which often is favoured by the pumping mechanism. This can be achieved by a very strong Kerr-lensing that is strong enough to modelock due to small changes of the laser field strength (laser field build-up or stochastic fluctuations).

Modelocking can also be started by shifting the optimum focus from the continuous-wave operation to pulsed operation while changing the power density by kicking the end mirror of the resonator cavity (though a piezo mounted, synchronous oscillating end-mirror would be more &#x27;turn key&#x27;).
Other principles involve different nonlinear effects like saturable absorbers and saturable Bragg reflectors, which induce pulses short enough to initiate the Kerr-lensing process.

== Modelocking – evolution of the pulse ==
Intensity changes with lengths of nanoseconds are amplified by the Kerr-lensing process and the pulselength further shrinks to achieve higher field strengths in the center of the pulse. This sharpening process is only limited by the bandwidth achievable with the laser material and the cavity-mirrors as well as the dispersion of the cavity. The shortest pulse achievable with a given spectrum is called the bandwidth-limited pulse.

Chirped mirror technology allows to compensate for timing mismatch of different wavelengths inside the cavity due to material dispersion while keeping the stability high and the losses low.

The Kerr effect leads to the Kerr-lens and Self-phase modulation at the same time. To a first approximation it is possible to consider them as independent effects.

== Applications ==
Since Kerr-lens modelocking is an effect that directly reacts on the electric field, the response time is fast enough to produce light pulses in the visible and near infrared with lengths of less than 5 femtoseconds. Due to the high electrical field strength focused ultrashort laser beams can overcome the threshold of 1014 W cm−2, which surpasses the field strength of the electron-ion bond in atoms.

These short pulses open the new field of ultrafast optics, which is a field of nonlinear optics that gives access to a completely new class of phenomena like measurement of electron movements in an atom (attosecond phenomena), coherent broadband light generation (ultrabroad lasers) and thereby gives rise to many new applications in optical sensing (e.g. coherent laser radar, ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography), material processing and other fields like metrology (extremely exact frequency and time measurements).

<doc id="628466" wikidata="Q77980689" url="?curid=628466" title="Outer automorphism group">
<text>In mathematics, the outer automorphism group of a group, , is the quotient, , where is the automorphism group of and ) is the subgroup consisting of inner automorphisms. The outer automorphism group is usually denoted . If is trivial and has a trivial center, then is said to be complete.

An automorphism of a group that is not inner is called an outer automorphism. The cosets of with respect to outer automorphisms are then the elements of ; this is an instance of the fact that quotients of groups are not, in general, (isomorphic to) subgroups. If the inner automorphism group is trivial (when a group is abelian), the automorphism group and outer automorphism group are naturally identified; that is, the outer automorphism group does act on the group.

For example, for the alternating group, , the outer automorphism group is usually the group of order 2, with exceptions noted below. Considering as a subgroup of the symmetric group, , conjugation by any odd permutation is an outer automorphism of or more precisely &quot;represents the class of the (non-trivial) outer automorphism of &quot;, but the outer automorphism does not correspond to conjugation by any &quot;particular&quot; odd element, and all conjugations by odd elements are equivalent up to conjugation by an even element.

== Structure ==
The Schreier conjecture asserts that is always a solvable group when is a finite simple group. This result is now known to be true as a corollary of the classification of finite simple groups, although no simpler proof is known.

== As dual of the center ==
The outer automorphism group is dual to the center in the following sense: conjugation by an element of is an automorphism, yielding a map . The kernel of the conjugation map is the center, while the cokernel is the outer automorphism group (and the image is the inner automorphism group). This can be summarized by the exact sequence

formula_1

== Applications ==
The outer automorphism group of a group acts on conjugacy classes, and accordingly on the character table. See details at character table: outer automorphisms.

=== Topology of surfaces ===
The outer automorphism group is important in the topology of surfaces because there is a connection provided by the Dehn–Nielsen theorem: the extended mapping class group of the surface is the outer automorphism group of its fundamental group.

== In finite groups ==
For the outer automorphism groups of all finite simple groups see the list of finite simple groups. Sporadic simple groups and alternating groups (other than the alternating group, ; see below) all have outer automorphism groups of order 1 or 2. The outer automorphism group of a finite simple group of Lie type is an extension of a group of &quot;diagonal automorphisms&quot; (cyclic except for , when it has order 4), a group of &quot;field automorphisms&quot; (always cyclic), and a group of &quot;graph automorphisms&quot; (of order 1 or 2 except for , when it is the symmetric group on 3 points). These extensions are not always semidirect products, as the case of the alternating group shows; a precise criterion for this to happen was given in 2003.

== In symmetric and alternating groups ==
The outer automorphism group of a finite simple group in some infinite family of finite simple groups can almost always be given by a uniform formula that works for all elements of the family. There is just one exception to this: the alternating group has outer automorphism group of order 4, rather than 2 as do the other simple alternating groups (given by conjugation by an odd permutation). Equivalently the symmetric group is the only symmetric group with a non-trivial outer automorphism group.
: formula_2

Note that, in the case of , the sequence does not split. A similar result holds for any , odd.

== In reductive algebraic groups ==

Let now be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field. Then any two Borel subgroups are conjugate by an inner automorphism, so to study outer automorphisms it suffices to consider automorphisms that fix a given Borel subgroup. Associated to the Borel subgroup is a set of simple roots, and the outer automorphism may permute them, while preserving the structure of the associated Dynkin diagram. In this way one may identify the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of with a subgroup of .

 has a very symmetric Dynkin diagram, which yields a large outer automorphism group of , namely ; this is called triality.

== In complex and real simple Lie algebras ==
The preceding interpretation of outer automorphisms as symmetries of a Dynkin diagram follows from the general fact, that for a complex or real simple Lie algebra, , the automorphism group is a semidirect product of and ; i.e., the short exact sequence
splits. In the complex simple case, this is a classical result, whereas for real simple Lie algebras, this fact was proven as recently as 2010.

== Word play ==
The term &quot;outer automorphism&quot; lends itself to word play: the term &quot;outermorphism&quot; is sometimes used for &quot;outer automorphism&quot;, and a particular geometry on which acts is called &quot;outer space&quot;.

<doc id="628467" wikidata="Q776129" url="?curid=628467" title="Space burial">
<text>Space burial is the launching of human remains into space. Missions may go into orbit around the Earth or to extraterrestrial bodies such as the Moon, or farther into space.

Remains are sealed until the spacecraft burns up upon re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or they reach their extraterrestrial destinations. Suborbital flights briefly transport them into space then return to Earth where they can be recovered. Small samples of remains are usually launched to minimize the cost of launching mass into space, thereby making such services more affordable.

==History and typology==
The concept of launching human remains into space using conventional rockets was proposed by the science fiction author Neil R. Jones in the novella &quot;The Jameson Satellite&quot;, which was published in the pulp magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1931. It was later proposed as a commercial service in the 1965 movie, &quot;The Loved One&quot;, and by Richard DeGroot in a &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; newspaper article on April 3, 1977. Since 1997, the private company Celestis has conducted numerous space burials flying as secondary payloads.

=== Maiden flights ===

The first space burial occurred in 1992 when the NASA (mission STS-52) carried a sample of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s cremated remains into space and returned them to Earth.

The first private space burial, Celestis&#x27; &quot;Earthview 01: The Founders Flight&quot;, was launched on April 21, 1997. An aircraft departing from the Canary Islands carried a Pegasus rocket containing samples of the remains of 24 people to an altitude of above the Atlantic Ocean. The rocket then carried the remains into an elliptical orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of , orbiting the Earth once every 96 minutes until re-entry on May 20, 2002, northeast of Australia. Famous people on this flight included Roddenberry and Timothy Leary.

=== Suborbital flights ===

Short flights that cross the boundary of space without attempting to reach orbital velocity are a cost-effective method of space burial. The remains do not burn up and are either recovered or lost.

=== Moon burial ===

The first moon burial was that of Eugene Merle Shoemaker, a portion of whose cremated remains were flown to the Moon by NASA. Shoemaker&#x27;s former colleague Carolyn Porco, a University of Arizona professor, proposed and produced the tribute of having Shoemaker&#x27;s ashes launched aboard the NASA&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; spacecraft. Ten days after Shoemaker&#x27;s passing, Porco had the go-ahead from NASA administrators and delivered the ashes to the &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; Mission Director Scott Hubbard at the NASA Ames Research Center. The ashes were accompanied by a piece of brass foil inscribed with an image of Comet Hale–Bopp, an image of a Meteor Crater in northern Arizona, and a passage from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; spacecraft was launched on January 6, 1998, and impacted the south polar region of the Moon on July 31, 1999.

Missions to the Moon are proposed by both Elysium Space and Celestis as part of a mission by Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh. The first mission in January 2024 failed to reach the Moon due to a failure of the spacecraft and instead reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere shortly after.

=== Pet burial ===

In 2014, Celestis launched Celestis Pets, a pet memorial spaceflight service for animal cremated remains. Prior to then, Bismarck, a Monroe, Washington police dog may have flown on a 2012 memorial spaceflight. When this news broke, Celestis&#x27; president said that if dog ashes were on the rocket, the person who supplied the cremated remains likely violated the contract they signed with Celestis.

=== Dedicated spacecraft ===

On May 17, 2017, Elysium Space announced the world&#x27;s first memorial flight involving a dedicated spacecraft. The CubeSat was placed as a secondary payload on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of a dedicated rideshare mission called SSO-A planned by Spaceflight. The launch took place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on December 3, 2018. The launch was successful, however, industry sources have noted that the Elysium Star spacecraft remained attached to the deployer due to a failure to procure proper licensing.

<text>Aaron Dupree Tippin (born July 3, 1958) is an American country music singer, songwriter and record producer. Initially a songwriter for Acuff-Rose Music, he gained a recording contract with RCA Nashville in 1990. His debut single, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Stand for Something&quot; became a popular anthem for American soldiers fighting in the Gulf War and helped to establish him as a neotraditionalist country act with songs that catered primarily to the American working class. Under RCA&#x27;s tenure, he recorded five studio albums and a Greatest Hits package. Tippin switched to Lyric Street Records in 1998, where he recorded four more studio albums, counting a compilation of Christmas music. After leaving Lyric Street in 2006, he founded a personal label known as Nippit Records, on which he issued the compilation album &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;. A concept album, &quot;In Overdrive&quot;, was released in 2009.

Tippin has released a total of nine studio albums and two compilations, with six gold certifications and one platinum certification among them. In addition, he has charted more than thirty singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, including three Number Ones: &quot;There Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Wrong with the Radio&quot; (1992), &quot;That&#x27;s as Close as I&#x27;ll Get to Loving You&quot; (1995), and &quot;Kiss This&quot; (2000), as well as the top ten hits &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Stand for Something&quot;, &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Have It Any Other Way&quot;, &quot;My Blue Angel&quot;, &quot;Workin&#x27; Man&#x27;s Ph.D.&quot;, &quot;For You I Will&quot;, and &quot;Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly&quot;.

==Biography==
Aaron Dupree Tippin was born July 3, 1958, in Pensacola, Florida. He was raised on a farm in Greer, South Carolina, where he went to Blue Ridge High School. In the 1970s, he made a living as a singer, performing in various local bars. By the time Tippin was 20, he was working as a commercial pilot, truck driver and a pipe fitter. In 1986, he moved to Nashville, where he eventually became a staff writer at Acuff-Rose. He competed on &quot;You Can Be a Star&quot;, a televised talent show on the former TNN (The Nashville Network). This led to him earning a song publishing contract in 1987. During this time he wrote songs for The Kingsmen, David Ball, Mark Collie, and Charley Pride.

==Musical career==
===1991–1997: RCA Records===
Tippin performed his first Nashville nightclub show in 1990, and it earned him a contract with RCA Records Nashville. His first single, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Stand for Something&quot;, was released in 1990. The song, with its message of standing up for one&#x27;s personal beliefs, became popular as an anthem for soldiers fighting in the Gulf War at the time, and reached a peak of No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts. It was also the title track to his debut album, released in late 1991. Although the album was certified gold in the United States, the next two singles performed poorly: &quot;I Wonder How Far It Is Over You&quot; peaked at No. 40, and &quot;She Made a Memory Out of Me&quot; at No. 54. Brian Mansfield of Allmusic, in his review of the album, said that &quot;This exciting hardcore country comes from a man whose previous blue-collar experience as a farm hand, welder, pilot, and truck driver made him a publicist&#x27;s dream.&quot; Giving it an &quot;A&quot;, Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Tippin&#x27;s &quot;humor&quot; and &quot;pointed language&quot;.

Tippin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Read Between the Lines&quot;, was released in 1992. Its first single was &quot;There Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Wrong with the Radio&quot;, which spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. Also released from this album were the singles &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Have It Any Other Way&quot;, &quot;I Was Born with a Broken Heart&quot; (previously a chart single in 1988 for Josh Logan), and &quot;My Blue Angel&quot;, which peaked at No. 5, No. 38 and No. 7, respectively, on the country charts. &quot;Read Between the Lines&quot; became Tippin&#x27;s first platinum album.

In 1993, Tippin released his third studio album, titled &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;. It produced three straight Top 40 country hits in &quot;Workin&#x27; Man&#x27;s Ph.D.&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Whole Lotta Love on the Line&quot;, while &quot;Honky Tonk Superman&quot;, the final single, failed to make Top 40. One year later, Tippin released his fourth album, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Back at Myself&quot;, which produced the No. 15 &quot;I Got It Honest&quot; and the minor Top 40 &quot;She Feels Like a Brand New Man Tonight&quot;.

&quot;Tool Box&quot;, his fifth album for RCA, produced his second Number One country hit in the ballad &quot;That&#x27;s as Close as I&#x27;ll Get to Loving You&quot;; the second single, &quot;Without Your Love&quot;, peaked at No. 22, while the album&#x27;s last two singles both failed to make Top 40. Like &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Lookin&#x27; Back at Myself&quot; before it, &quot;Tool Box&quot; also earned a gold certification from the RIAA.

Tippin&#x27;s final release for the RCA label, a compilation titled &quot;Greatest Hits… and Then Some&quot;, was issued in 1997. This album produced two chart singles which both failed to make Top 40.

In 1994 Tippin performed the National Anthem at Starrcade the annual Professional Wrestling Pay Per View Event for World Championship Wrestling.

===1998–2005: Lyric Street===

In 1998, Tippin moved to Lyric Street Records, then a newly formed subsidiary label of the Walt Disney Company. His first single for the label, the No. 6 hit &quot;For You I Will&quot;, served as the lead-off to his 1998 album &quot;What This Country Needs&quot; and became his first Top Ten hit since &quot;That&#x27;s as Close as I&#x27;ll Get to Loving You&quot;. Following it were &quot;I&#x27;m Leaving&quot; at No. 17, &quot;Her&quot; at No. 33, and the title track at No. 48.

2000 saw the release of the single &quot;Kiss This&quot;. Co-written by Tippin with his wife, Thea, the song went to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, becoming his third and final Number One hit. It served as the lead-off to his second Lyric Street album, &quot;People Like Us&quot;, and the David Lee Murphy-penned title track reached Top 20 in 2001. &quot;People Like Us&quot; was also certified gold.

In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he released the patriotic-themed song &quot;Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly&quot;. His biggest crossover hit, the song reached No. 2 on the country charts and No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was included on his album &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;, which was released in early 2002 (following the release of his Christmas album &quot;A December to Remember&quot;). &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; produced three more singles, including the ballad &quot;Love Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow&quot;, a duet with Thea.

Tippin&#x27;s last release for Lyric Street was a single, entitled &quot;Come Friday&quot;, which was slated to be included on an album entitled &quot;I Believed&quot;. The single peaked at No. 42 on the country charts, and &quot;I Believed&quot; was not released; by 2005, he had exited Lyric Street.

===2006–2012===
In 2006, Tippin formed his own record label, Nippit Records, in a joint partnership with Rust Nashville. His first release for the album, &quot;Aaron Tippin: Now &amp; Then&quot;, produced the singles &quot;Ready to Rock (In a Country Kind of Way)&quot; and &quot;He Believed&quot;, the latter of which peaked at No. 55 on the country charts. On September 9, 2007, Aaron released a new single called &quot;Drill Here, Drill Now&quot; which was inspired by the &quot;Drill Here&quot; movement led by Newt Gingrich at his American Solutions organization.

Tippin signed to Country Crossing Records in 2008. His first album for the label, &quot;In Overdrive&quot;, was released in February 2009. This album comprises covers of country songs that have truck driving themes.

==Musical style==
Tippin&#x27;s singing voice is a baritone, characterized by a heavy, nasal Southern twang. His phrasing has been compared to Hank Williams for &quot;the catch in the throat, followed by a sliding moan&quot;, as described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Alanna Nash in her review of Tippin&#x27;s debut.

Several of Tippin&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Workin&#x27; Man&#x27;s Ph.D&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Stand for Something&quot;, are mid-tempo anthems that address the working class, and are often patriotic in nature. Occasionally, Tippin records love-themed ballads, such as &quot;That&#x27;s as Close as I&#x27;ll Get to Loving You&quot;. Other songs of his, such as &quot;There Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Wrong with the Radio&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Superman&quot;, are honky tonk-influenced novelties.

==Personal life==
On July 15, 1995, Tippin married the former Thea Corontzos at a Greek Orthodox ceremony in Nashville. Along with his manager, Billy Craven, Aaron and Thea Tippin created Tippin&#x27;s company, Tip Top Entertainment. They reside in Dowelltown, Tennessee. The couple has a daughter and two sons. Tippin also opened two hunting supply stores called Aaron Tippin Firearms: one in Smithville, Tennessee, and the other was run by his late father, Willis Emory Tippin, in Oak City, North Carolina. (Willis died in 2005.) According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Tippin is an instrument rated commercial pilot with single and multi-engine ratings. He also has private pilot privileges for rotorcraft-helicopter. He is a certified airframe and power plant mechanic. He is also a longtime bodybuilder. His son, Thomas, has made recordings with his father.

<text>Xu Dishan (; given name: ; pen name: Luo Huasheng; ; 3 February 1893 – 4 August 1941) was a Chinese author, translator and folklorist. He received his education in China, the United States, Britain, and India; while in school, he studied diverse topics in religion, philosophy, and literature. Upon his return to China, he was an active member of the May Fourth Movement, and published literary journals with his academic peers. He wrote a plethora of academic and fictitious works during his life, many of which he published under the pen name Luo Huasheng. He was best known for his short stories that focus on the people from the southern provinces of China and Southeast Asia. The protagonists of his stories were often women. Xu Dishan was a strong proponent of the Latinization Movement and believed that writing Chinese with a phonetic alphabet would greatly increase literacy. He died at age 47 from a heart attack.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life ===
Xu Dishan was born in Tainan, Taiwan on 14 February 1893. He was one of eight children born to his father, Xu Nanying, and mother, Wu Shen. His father was a Taiwanese jinshi who assisted Liu Yongfu to establish the Republic of Formosa in Tainan. After the Japanese takeover in 1895 his family escaped to Shantou via the harbour of Anping. Following the fall of the Republic of Formosa, Xu Nanying resided in Thailand, Singapore, and Sumatra. After returning from Southeast Asia, Xu Nanying moved his family to Fujian, and in 1897 they settled down in Guangzhou where Xu Dishan received his education. During his stay in Guangzhou, Xu Dishan learned Cantonese, Cantonese opera, Cantonese folk songs, and pipa. He spoke both Hokkien and Teochew as his mother tongues. After the 1911 Revolution, Xu Nanying received position as an administrator in southern Fujian. Xu Dishan accompanied his father and taught in primary and secondary schools in Zhangzhou. Later, he also worked as a teacher in a Chinese-language school in Yangon, Myanmar. In 1915, he moved back to China where he continued to teach for two years. During this time he taught at both the Huaying Middle School and the Second Fujian Provincial Teacher&#x27;s College.

=== Personal life ===
In 1918, while Xu Dishan was studying at Yenching University, he married his wife, Lin Yuesen, and they had a daughter. After his graduation in 1920, Xu Dishan traveled back to Fujian to bring his wife and daughter to Beijing to live with him; however, his wife died during the journey back to Beijing. In 1929, he married his second wife, Zhou Sisong; together they had a daughter and a son. Xu Dishan died of a heart attack on 4 August 1941.

== Education and academia ==

=== Education ===
In 1917, Xu Dishan attended Yenching University for his undergraduate studies. During this time, he began to study Sanskrit, and studied the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, a prominent Bengali poet. He graduated in 1920 with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature and enrolled in the seminary at Yenching University to continue his study of comparative religion. In 1922, he received his bachelor&#x27;s in religious studies from the university. Upon his graduation, he moved to New York City to pursue a master&#x27;s degree at Columbia University&#x27;s Department of Indo-Iranian languages; he graduated in 1924 with a master&#x27;s degree in comparative religion and the history of religion. He then moved to England, and completed another bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Oxford in folklore, Indian philosophy, religious history, and Sanskrit which he completed in 1926. Before returning to China, he spent a year in India at the Banaras Hindu University to continue his studies in Sanskrit; during this time he also studied Indian literature and Buddhism. While in India, he met Tagore who urged him to compile and publish a Chinese–Sanskrit dictionary.

=== Teaching career ===
In 1927, after returning to China from India, he took up a teaching position at Yenching University. He also spent time teaching at Peking University and Tsinghua University, two elite universities in Beijing. He taught courses that focused on Indian literature and Sanskrit. In 1935, he secured the post of Chinese professor at the University of Hong Kong. His professorship entailed teaching the Confucian classics as well as literature from the Tang and Song dynasties.

== Literary involvement ==

=== Writing style ===
Xu Dishan&#x27;s writing style diverges from many of his contemporaries. Some of his earliest writings follow convention May Fourth Era story lines, but are not set in China. Xu Dishan takes up Southeast Asian communities as his subjects in many of his stories. Additionally, many of his earliest writings showcase powerful women and explore religious themes. Often, these women gain strength from the teachings of multiple religions, rather than strictly adhering to the dogma of just one; in this way Xu Dishan&#x27;s female protagonists are world citizens who make their own way in the world. His works with religious underpinnings tend to focus on such themes as love, charity, and other values fundamental to religion; through his writing, he illustrates the omnipresence of religion in all life. His fascination with Theravada Buddhism influences his work, and many of his stories draw inspiration from Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian myths. Many May Fourth Era writers write about myths individually, but Xu Dishan incorporates mythic elements into his stories. Xu Dishan&#x27;s fiction tends to be romantic and involve sophisticated plot lines which deal with human nature and how to live a good life. They often engage a moral message that usually engages with the idea that how one attains his goal is just as important as the goal itself; in other words, the means are just as important as the ends.

=== Literary involvement (1919–1921) ===
While at Yenching University, Xu Dishan was an active part of the May the Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement; he participated by attending meetings and organizing conversations with his fellow students. Xu Dishan, Qu Qiubai, and Zheng Zhenduo edited &quot;Xin shihue xunkan (&quot;New Society Thrice Monthly), a journal that was in publication from November 1919 to May 1920. In 1921, Xu Dishan, Zheng Zhenduo, Mao Dun, and Ye Shaojun founded the literary society &quot;Wenxue yanjiu hui&quot; (Literary Research Association). Also in 1921, Xu Dishan and Zheng Zhenduo established the &quot;Taige&#x27;er yanjiu hui&quot; (Tagore Research Society), which operated as a subsidiary of the Literary Research Association. Among other duties, the Literary Research Association was responsible for editing &quot;Xiaoshuo yuebao&quot; (Fiction Monthly), the magazine in which Xu Dishan published his first short stories. Xu Dishan published his writing under the pen name Luo Huasheng.

=== Literary involvement (1925–1934) ===
Xu Dishan continued to publish short publications in &quot;Xiaoshuo yuebao&quot; (Short Story Monthly) while he studied and taught. In 1925, his short stories were published in the collection &quot;Zhuiwang laozhu&quot; (The Web Mending Spider), and his essays were collected into the work &quot;Kongshan lingyu&quot; (Timely Rain on an Empty Mountain). Additionally, he wrote about how Indian and Iranian literature influenced literature produced in China; he continued his engagement with Indian literature by translating Indian fiction into Chinese, and in 1930 published &quot;Yindu wenxue&quot; (Indian Literature). Besides Indian literature, Xu Dishan wrote on a variety of topics. He gathered works written in English about the Opium Wars, and published &quot;Da zhong ji: Yapian zhanzheng qian Zhong Ying jiaoshe shiliao&quot; (Meeting Halfway: Historical Materials on Negotiations between China and England before the Opium War) in 1931, and in 1933 published a collection of sacred Buddhist texts: &quot;Fozang zimu yinde&quot; (Combined Indices to the Authors and Titles in Four Collections of Buddhistic Literature). During this period of time, the late 1920s and early 1930s, he also published several satirical critiques of urban society in contemporary China and the unbridled corruption that was prevalent at the time, as well as articles pertaining to women&#x27;s clothing and its history in the Chinese context. In 1934, he published the first volume of a project he never completed: a complete history of Chinese Daoism: &quot;Daojiao shi&quot; (A history of Daoism).

=== Literary involvement (1937–1941) ===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Xu supported the war against Japan. He involved himself in several patriotic activities, including writing a one act historical drama in 1938, &quot;Nü guoshi&quot; (The Woman Patriot) which was performed by the Women&#x27;s Student Association at the University of Hong Kong. He was one of the founding members of the National Resistance Association of Literary and Art Workers.

=== Latinization ===
For Xu Dishan, an important part of the legacy of the May Fourth Movement was the implementation of phonetic Chinese. He was a strong proponent of the Latinization Movement. He believed that the Chinese script needed to be reformed and that China should use the Western Roman alphabet to help spell out words phonetically, instead of using characters. Xu Dishan was an advocate of latinization because he saw it as a path to dramatically increase national literacy rates. In this way, he departed from the mainstream belief held by many May Fourth intellectuals; that is, that the Chinese language should adopt &quot;baihua&quot; (plain speech).

<text>Xin Qiji (28 May 1140 – 3 Oct 1207) was a Chinese poet, calligrapher, and military general during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279).

==Life==
During Xin&#x27;s lifetime, northern China was occupied during the Jin–Song Wars by the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty, a semi-nomadic people who moved to what is now Northeastern China. Only southern China was ruled by the Han Chinese during the Southern Song dynasty. Xin was born in the modern city of Jinan in Shandong Province, then governed by the Jin Dynasty. Xin was raised by his grandfather because of Xin&#x27;s father&#x27;s early death. In his childhood, his grandfather told him about the time when the Han Chinese ruled the north and told him to be an honorable man and seek revenge against the barbarian for the nation. It was then when he developed his patriotic feelings. At the ages of 14 and 17, Xin attended the imperial examination twice, but failed both of them. However, on Xin&#x27;s way to Jin&#x27;s capital for examinations, he followed his grandfather&#x27;s instruction to inspect the military and geographic situation in Jin dynasty. His grandfather named him after a legendary military commander from the Western Han, Huo Qubing. Both &quot;Qubing&quot; and &quot;Qiji&quot; mean to deliver oneself from diseases.

Xin started his military career at the age of twenty-two. He commanded an insurrection group of fifty men and fought the Jurchen alongside Geng Jing&#x27;s much larger army that consisted of tens of thousands of men. Although they had some small-scale victories, in 1161, because the Jurchen were becoming more united internally, Xin persuaded Geng Jing to join forces with the Southern Song army in order to fight the Jurchen more effectively. Geng Jing agreed but just as Xin finished a meeting with the Southern Song Emperor, who endorsed Geng Jing&#x27;s troops, Xin learned that Geng Jing had been assassinated by their former friend-turned-traitor, Zhang Anguo (张安国/張安國). With merely fifty men, Xin fought his way through the Jurchen camp and captured Zhang Anguo. Xin then led his men safely back across the border and had Zhang Anguo decapitated by the emperor.

Xin&#x27;s victory gained him a place in the Southern Song court. However, because the emperor was surrounded by people who supported &quot;an appeasement policy&quot; rather than open warfare with the Jin, Xin was sidelined. From 1161 to 1181, he held a series of minor posts that never amounted to anything momentous. Although during the same period, he tried to offer the emperor his treatises on how to manage the invasions by the Jin as well as other state affairs, he was never taken seriously. Finally he resolved to do things on his own. He improved the irrigation systems in his district, relocated poverty-struck peasants and trained his own troops. His ambition soon aroused suspicion against him. In 1181, he was forced to resign. He left for Jiangxi where he then stayed and perfected his famous ci form of poetry for ten depressing years.

In 1192, Xin was recalled to the Song court to take up another minor post because the previous incumbent had died. This job did not last long because once he completed the requirements of his job, he started training men for military purposes again. He was soon discharged.

From 1192 to 1203, Xin lived in seclusion around Jiangxi Province. Xin gave himself an art name – &quot;Jiaxuan&quot; (), which meant &quot;Life should be diligent and take farming as the prime importance&quot;.

In 1188, Xin met another patriotic poet, Chen Liang, in E hu Temple (around Piao Spring, Jiangxi Province). They conferred the strategy to fight against Jin dynasty and revive their home country.

During Xin&#x27;s seclusion, Xin also traveled with Zhu Xi, the master of Neo Confucianism, in Wuyi Mountain. In 1200, upon Zhu xi&#x27;s death, none of Zhu&#x27;s old friends or students mourned him because of the political restriction. However, Xin attended the funeral and wrote lament for Zhu.

In 1203, as the Jin began pressing harder against the Southern Song border, Han Tuozhou, the consul of the Southern Song court, in need of militarists, took Xin under his wing. However, Han Tuozhou disregarded Xin&#x27;s sincere advice for effective military moves, and he removed Xin from his team the next year, accusing Xin of being lubricious, avaricious, and many other non-existent faults. The crucial moment came in 1207 when the Jin defiantly asked for Han Tuozhou&#x27;s head for a peace treaty. It was then that Han realized that he needed Xin again. Xin did not hesitate in responding to Han&#x27;s call for help; unfortunately, he died of old age soon afterward.

In 1208, after Xin&#x27;s death, Ni si impeached him for committing treason and requested the Southern Song government to deprive&#x27;s Xin&#x27;s official title. In 1257, Xie Fangde petitioned the Southern Song government for justifying Xin&#x27;s innocence. The government then vindicated Xin and endowed him a posthumous title – &quot;Zhong Min&quot;, which meant loyalty and encouragement.

==Works==
Some six hundred and twenty of Xin&#x27;s poems survive today. All were written after he moved to the south.

===Poetry===
Scholars considered Xin&#x27;s literary caliber to be equally talented in ci as his Song dynasty counterpart, Su Shi. Their difference, however, is that the content of Xin&#x27;s poetry spans an even greater range of topics. Xin is also famous for employing many allusions in his poems.

Some of the most quoted lines from his poetry (with accompanying translations) are shown below.



In the last line, there is a sudden transition from Xin&#x27;s personal understanding of melancholy to the season that he&#x27;s experiencing. The autumn carries many meanings in Chinese literature. It can be construed here as a deeper understanding of the last line being full of sadness, including:

*True sorrow can&#x27;t be expressed by words;
*Repeating the sorrow as another deep hurt;
*The understanding that even if one is able to find the words to show bitterness, no one understands it;
*The understanding that even if people who understand your bitterness are found, nothing will be changed.

=== Calligraphy ===
Little of Xin&#x27;s calligraphy has survived. &quot;Quguo tie&quot; is the only preserved one which is now documented in Beijing Palace Museum. &quot;Quguo tie&quot; was created in Xin&#x27;s 36 years old (around 1175 Oct), after Xin suppressed the bandit&#x27;s rebellion in Jiangxi.

== Commentaries ==
The 20th-century Chinese diplomat and philosopher Hu Shih asserts that Xin Qiji ranks first among authors in creative lyrics. According to Hu, Xin shows great talent, keen intellect, intensive and sincere feeling in writing lyrics.

The Chinese ethnologist and historian Bai Shouyi stated that Xin Qiji aimed his life at recovering the lost territories and contributing to his country. Unfortunately, Xin was ill-fated and repressed, and so failed to realize his ambitions. However, Xin never shook his patriotic resolve, and put all his enthusiasm and worries about national destiny to the creation of poetry.

The Chinese historian Deng Guangming contends that although Xin was inherently an extremely passionate patriot, he was forced to pretend to be a detached and calm man, who is indifferent about political affairs.

==Portrayal of Xin Qiji in the arts==
===Film===
The film 辛弃疾1162, also known as &quot;Fighting for the Motherland 1162&quot;, published in 2020 by Zheijang Media Trust Film, portrayed the role of Xin Qiji in the uprising of 1162.

<text>Ji Kang (, 223–262), sometimes referred to as Xi Kang, courtesy name Shuye (), was a Chinese composer, essayist, philosopher, and poet of the Three Kingdoms period. He was one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove who held aloof from the dangerous politics of third-century China to devote themselves to art and refinement.

Ji Kang is noted as an author and was also a famous composer and guqin-player. He was described as a handsome and tall man (approximately 1.88 metres).

==Life==
As a thinker, Ji Kang wrote on longevity, music theory, politics and ethics. Among his works were &quot;Yangsheng Lun&quot; (飬生論, Essay on Nourishing Life), &quot;Shengwu Aile Lun&quot; (聲無哀樂論, Discourse on sounds [as] lacking sorrow or joy, i.e. On the Absence of Sentiments in Music), &quot;Qin Fu&quot; (琴賦, A Composition on the Qin), and &quot;Shisi Lun&quot; (釋私論, Discourse on Individuality). As a musician, Ji Kang composed a number of solo pieces for the qin. 

Ji Kang was highly critical of Confucianism and challenged many social conventions of his time, provoking scandal and suspicion. He married Cao Cao&#x27;s granddaughter (or great-granddaughter according to some). Ji Kang assumed a post under the Cao Wei state, but official work bored him. When the regent Sima Zhao came to power, he offered Ji Kang a civil position, but Ji Kang insolently rejected Sima Zhao&#x27;s envoy Zhong Hui. When one of Ji Kang&#x27;s friends was imprisoned on false charges, Ji Kang testified in his defense, but both were sent to jail. At Zhong Hui&#x27;s urging, Sima Zhao sentenced Ji Kang to death. Three thousand scholars petitioned for his pardon, but his enemies were implacable. Before his execution, Ji Kang is said to have played one last melody on the guqin, a swan song forever lost.

Ji Kang wrote &quot;Guangling San&quot;, a composition for the guqin recounting the assassination of a king of Han. It was said to be inspired by a spirit visitation, and was widely acclaimed. He was also believed to have become a &quot;xian&quot; (Taoist immortal) through shijie by mainstream Taoism.

<doc id="628479" wikidata="Q6704262" url="?curid=628479" title="Lung Fu Shan Country Park">
<text>Lung Fu Shan Country Park, established 18 December 1998, is a country park in the Central and Western District of Hong Kong. It covers the densely vegetated slopes of Lung Fu Shan (&quot;aka.&quot; Hill Above Belcher&#x27;s), and includes the disused Pinewood Battery as well as the Pinewood Garden picnic area, providing a scenic backdrop to the residential and commercial districts of Hong Kong Island. 

In proximity to the Mid-levels and the Western District, Lung Fu Shan is intensively used by members of the public, especially by morning walkers and picnickers. It is situated to the north of Pok Fu Lam Country Park. Towards the east of Lung Fu Shan Country Park is Hatton Road, to the south is Harlech Road whereas to the north and west is a covered conduit constructed by the Waterworks Office. This country park covers an area of about , making it the smallest country park in Hong Kong.

==History==
In 1993, a government planning study (the Territorial Development Strategy Review) identified the area as a potential site for a new country park.

The Country and Marine Parks Authority prepared a draft map of the proposed Lung Fu Shan Country Park, which was published for public inspection on 5 June 1998. In November 1998, the draft map was approved by the chief executive in council. The 47-hectare country park, the 23rd in Hong Kong, was formally designated on 18 December 1998.

==Features==
===Lung Fu Shan Environmental Education Centre===

Situated on Kotewall Road and near University Drive. Established in 2008 by the Hong Kong University and the Environmental Protection Department, the Environmental Education Visitor Centre has been set up to address environmental challenges through collaborative and constructive actions. Its mission is to maintain and take care of nature through education by working together with the University, Government, and the community. Its main goal is to provide accessible education to the community, so that they can grow and become closer to nature 

On top of building public awareness and education, the centre is now carrying out Citizen Science projects. Their first BioBlitz was held in 2017, with the 100 participants and volunteers observing 151 species in Lung Fu Shan Country Park with the guidance of 11 experts. In 2018 this was expanded to separate BioBlitz surveys into four animal groups: Birds; Butterflies, (other) Insects, and Amphibians and Reptiles

===Lung Fu Shan Trail===
The Lung Fu Shan Fitness Trail is a -long trail on the Peak. Signs on the trail offer information about safe hiking. The trail starts at Pinewood Garden and proceeds through the Pinewood Battery, a few barbecue sites, a number of shelters, a flight of steps, and a stretch of steep road before arriving at the junction of Harlech Road and Hatton Road. It takes about 60 minutes to hike the entire trail.

===Pinewood Battery===

Pinewood Battery is a disused military site constructed around 1903, which has been preserved within the country park. The park has interpretive signage illustrating the historical significance of the battery.

Some visitors have illegally used the site for wargaming. To prevent further damage to the battery, the Country and Marine Parks Authority of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) erected a warning sign, stating that &quot;using or possession of any firearm, airgun, propelling or releasing instrument are prohibited&quot;. However, many plastic BB bullets are still found on the site.

===View Compass===
The View Compass commands an excellent vistas of the western part of the territory and the Victoria Harbour.

<text>A television set or television receiver (more commonly called TV, TV set, television, telly, or tele) is an electronic device for viewing and hearing television broadcasts, or as a computer monitor. It combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media for consumer use in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS; these were later succeeded by DVD. It has been used as a display device since the first generation of home computers (e.g. Timex Sinclair 1000) and dedicated video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. By the early 2010s, flat-panel television incorporating liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, especially LED-backlit LCD technology, largely replaced CRT and other display technologies. Modern flat-panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080i, 1080p, 4K, 8K) and can also play content from a USB device. In the late 2010s, most flat-panel TVs began offering 4K and 8K resolutions.

==History==
===Early television===

Mechanical televisions were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The earliest commercially made televisions were radios with the addition of a television device consisting of a neon tube behind a mechanically spinning disk with a spiral of apertures that produced a red postage-stamp size image, enlarged to twice that size by a magnifying glass. The Baird &quot;Televisor&quot; (sold in 1930–1933 in the UK) is considered the first mass-produced television, selling about a thousand units.

Karl Ferdinand Braun was the first to conceive the use of a CRT as a display device in 1897. &quot;The &quot;Braun tube&quot;&quot; became the foundation of 20th century TV. In 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated the first TV system that employed a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display, at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II.

The first commercially made electronic televisions with CRTs were manufactured by Telefunken in Germany in 1934, followed by other makers in France (1936), Britain (1936), and US (1938). The cheapest model with a screen was $445 (). An estimated 19,000 electronic televisions were manufactured in Britain, and about 1,600 in Germany, before World War II. About 7,000–8,000 electronic sets were made in the U.S. before the War Production Board halted manufacture in April 1942, production resuming in August 1945. Television usage in the western world skyrocketed after World War II with the lifting of the manufacturing freeze, war-related technological advances, the drop in television prices caused by mass production, increased leisure time, and additional disposable income. While only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962. In Britain, there were 15,000 television households in 1947, 1.4 million in 1952, and 15.1 million by 1968.

===Transistorised television===
Early electronic television sets were large and bulky, with analog circuits made of vacuum tubes. As an example, the RCA CT-100 color TV set used 36 vacuum tubes. Following the invention of the first working transistor at Bell Labs, Sony founder Masaru Ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets. The first fully transistorized, portable solid-state television set was the Sony TV8-301, developed in 1959 and released in 1960. By the 1970s, television manufacturers utilized this push for miniaturization to create small, console-styled sets which their salesmen could easily transport, pushing demand for television sets out into rural areas. However, the first fully transistorized color TV set, the HMV Colourmaster Model 2700, was released in 1967 by the British Radio Corporation. This began the transformation of television viewership from a communal viewing experience to a solitary viewing experience. By 1960, Sony had sold over 4million portable television sets worldwide.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, color television had come into wide use. In Britain, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV were regularly broadcasting in colour by 1969.

Late model CRT TVs used highly integrated electronics such as a Jungle chip which performs the functions of many transistors.

===LCD television===

Paul K. Weimer at RCA developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962, later the idea of a TFT-based liquid-crystal display (LCD) was conceived by Bernard Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. Lechner, F. J. Marlowe, E. O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with a dynamic scattering LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs.

In 1973, T. Peter Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories demonstrated the first thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AM LCD) in 1974.

By 1982, pocket LCD TVs based on AM LCD technology were developed in Japan. The Epson ET-10 (Epson Elf) was the first color LCD pocket TV, released in 1984. In 1988, a Sharp research team led by engineer T. Nagayasu demonstrated a full-color LCD display, which convinced the electronics industry that LCD would eventually replace the CRT as the standard television display technology. The first wall-mountable TV was introduced by Sharp Corporation in 1992.

During the first decade of the 21st century, CRT &quot;picture tube&quot; display technology was almost entirely supplanted worldwide by flat-panel displays: first plasma displays around 1997, then LCDs. By the early 2010s, LCD TVs, which increasingly used LED-backlit LCDs, accounted for the overwhelming majority of television sets being manufactured.

In 2014, Curved OLED TVs were released to the market, which were intended to offer improved image quality but this effect was only visible at a certain position away from the TV.

Rollable OLED TVs were introduced in 2020, which allow the display panel of the TV to be hidden.

2023 saw the release of wireless TVs which connect to other devices solely through a transmitter box with an antenna that transmits information wirelessly to the TV. Demos of transparent TVs have also been made. There are TVs that are offered to users for free, but are paid for by showing ads to users and collecting user data.

===TV sizes===
Cambridge&#x27;s Clive Sinclair created a mini TV in 1967 that could be held in the palm of a hand and was the world&#x27;s smallest television at the time, though it never took off commercially because the design was complex. In 2019, Samsung launched the largest television to date at . The average size of TVs has grown over time.

In 2024, the sales of large-screen televisions significantly increased. Between January and September, approximately 38 thousand televisions with a screen size of or larger were sold globally. This surge in popularity can be attributed to several factors, including technological advancements and decreasing prices.

The availability of larger screen sizes at more affordable prices has driven consumer demand. For example, Samsung, a leading electronics manufacturer, introduced its first television in 2019 with a price tag of $99,000. In 2024, the company will offer four models starting at $4,000. This trend is reflected in the overall market, with the average price of a television exceeding , declining from $6,662 in 2023 to $3,113 in 2024. As technology advances, even larger screen sizes, such as , are becoming increasingly accessible to consumers.

==Display==

Television sets may employ one of several available display technologies. As of mid-2019, LCDs overwhelmingly predominate in new merchandise, but OLED displays are claiming an increasing market share as they become more affordable and DLP technology continues to offer some advantages in projection systems. The production of plasma and CRT displays has been completely discontinued.

There are four primary competing TV technologies:
* CRT
* LCD (multiple variations of LCD screens are called QLED, quantum dot, LED, LCD TN, LCD IPS, LCD PLS, LCD VA, etc.)
* OLED
* Plasma

===CRT===
The cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing a so-called electron gun (or three for a color television) and a fluorescent screen where the television image is displayed. The electron gun accelerates electrons in a beam which is deflected in both the vertical and horizontal directions using varying electric or (usually, in television sets) magnetic fields, in order to scan a raster image onto the fluorescent screen. The CRT requires an evacuated glass envelope, which is rather deep (well over half of the screen size), fairly heavy, and breakable. As a matter of radiation safety, both the face (panel) and back (funnel) were made of thick lead glass in order to reduce human exposure to harmful ionizing radiation (in the form of x-rays) produced when electrons accelerated using a high voltage () strike the screen. By the early 1970s, most color TVs replaced leaded glass in the face panel with vitrified strontium oxide glass, which also blocked x-ray emissions but allowed better color visibility. This also eliminated the need for cadmium phosphors in earlier color televisions. Leaded glass, which is less expensive, continued to be used in the funnel glass, which is not visible to the consumer.

In television sets (and most computer monitors that use CRTs), the entire screen area is scanned repetitively (completing a full frame 25 or 30 times a second) in a fixed pattern called a raster. The image information is received in real time from a video signal which controls the electric current supplying the electron gun, or in color televisions each of the three electron guns whose beams land on phosphors of the three primary colors (red, green, and blue). Except in the very early days of television, &quot;magnetic deflection&quot; has been used to scan the image onto the face of the CRT; this involves a varying current applied to both the vertical and horizontal deflection coils placed around the neck of the tube just beyond the electron gun(s).

===DLP===
Digital light processing (DLP) is a type of video projector technology that uses a digital micromirror device. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses.

DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in additive manufacturing as a power source in some SLA 3D printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.

===Rear projection===
Rear-projection televisions (RPTVs) became very popular in the early days of television, when the ability to practically produce tubes with a large display size did not exist. In 1936, for a tube capable of being mounted horizontally in the television cabinet, would have been regarded as the largest convenient size that could be made owing to its required length, due to the low deflection angles of CRTs produced in the era, which meant that CRTs with large front sizes would have also needed to be very deep, which caused such CRTs to be installed at an angle to reduce the cabinet depth of the TV set. tubes and TV sets were available, but the tubes were so long (deep) that they were mounted vertically and viewed via a mirror in the top of the TV set cabinet which was usually mounted under a hinged lid, reducing considerably the depth of the set but making it taller. These mirror lid televisions were large pieces of furniture.

As a solution, Philips introduced a television set in 1937 that relied on back projecting an image from a tube onto a screen. This required the tube to be driven very hard (at unusually high voltages and currents, see ) to produce an extremely bright image on its fluorescent screen. Further, Philips decided to use a green phosphor on the tube face as it was brighter than the white phosphors of the day. In fact these early tubes were not up to the job and by November of that year Philips decided that it was cheaper to buy the sets back than to provide replacement tubes under warranty every couple of weeks or so. Substantial improvements were very quickly made to these small tubes and a more satisfactory tube design was available the following year helped by Philips&#x27;s decision to use a smaller screen size of . In 1950 a more efficient tube with vastly improved technology and more efficient white phosphor, along with smaller and less demanding screen sizes, was able to provide an acceptable image, though the life of the tubes was still shorter than contemporary direct view tubes. As CRT technology improved during the 1950s, producing larger and larger screen sizes and later on, (more or less) rectangular tubes, the rear projection system was obsolete before the end of the decade.

However, in the early to mid 2000s RPTV systems made a comeback as a cheaper alternative to contemporary LCD and Plasma TVs. They were larger and lighter than contemporary CRT TVs and had a flat screen just like LCD and Plasma, but unlike LCD and Plasma, RPTVs were often dimmer, had lower contrast ratios and viewing angles, image quality was affected by room lighting and suffered when compared with direct view CRTs, and were still bulky like CRTs. These TVs worked by having a DLP, LCoS or LCD projector at the bottom of the unit, and using a mirror to project the image onto a screen. The screen may be a Fresnel lens to increase brightness at the cost of viewing angles. Some early units used CRT projectors and were heavy, weighing up to 500 pounds. Most RPTVs used Ultra-high-performance lamps as their light source, which required periodic replacement partly because they dimmed with use but mainly because the operating bulb glass became weaker with ageing to the point where the bulb could eventually shatter often damaging the projection system. Those that used CRTs and lasers did not require replacement.

===Plasma===
A plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat-panel display common to large TV displays or larger. They are called &quot;plasma&quot; displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps. Around 2014, television manufacturers were largely phasing out plasma TVs, because a plasma TV became higher cost and more difficult to make in 4k compared to LED or LCD.
In 1997, Philips introduced at CES and CeBIT the first large () commercially available flat-panel TV, using Fujitsu plasma displays.

===LCD===

Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use liquid-crystal displays to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than CRTs of similar display size and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers.

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions globally for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the plasma display panel and rear-projection television. In the mid-2010s LCDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.

LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including OLEDs, FED and SED. LCDs can have quantum dots and mini-LED backlights to enhance image quality.

===OLED===

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs.

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs (AMOLED) require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a backlight. Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room, an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight.

==Television types==
While most televisions are designed for consumers in the household, there are several markets that demand variations including hospitality, healthcare, and other commercial settings.

===Hospitality television===
Televisions made for the hospitality industry are part of an establishment&#x27;s internal television system designed to be used by its guests. Therefore, settings menus are hidden and locked by a password. Other common software features include volume limiting, customizable power-on splash image, and channel hiding. These TVs are typically controlled by a set-back box using one of the data ports on the rear of the TV. The set back box may offer channel lists, pay per view, video on demand, and casting from a smart phone or tablet.

Hospitality spaces are insecure with respect to content piracy, so many content providers require the use of Digital rights management. Hospitality TVs decrypt the industry standard Pro:Idiom when no set back box is used. While H.264 is not part of the ATSC 1.0 standard in North America, TV content in hospitality can include H.264 encoded video, so hospitality TVs include H.264 decoding. Managing dozens or hundreds of TVs can be time consuming, so hospitality TVs can be cloned by storing settings on a USB drive and restoring those settings quickly. Additionally, server-based and cloud-based management systems can monitor and configure an entire fleet of TVs.

===Healthcare television===
Healthcare televisions include the provisions of hospitality TVs with additional features for usability and safety. They are designed for use in a healthcare setting in which the user may have limited mobility and audio/visual impairment. A key feature is the pillow speaker connection. Pillow speakers combine nurse call functions, TV remote control and a speaker for audio. In multiple occupancy rooms where several TVs are used in close proximity, the televisions can be programmed to respond to a remote control with unique codes so that each remote only controls one TV. Smaller TVs, also called bedside infotainment systems, have a full function keypad below the screen. This allows direct interaction without the use of a pillow speaker or remote. These TVs typically have antimicrobial surfaces and can withstand daily cleaning using disinfectants. In the US, the UL safety standard for televisions, UL 62368-1, contains a special section (annex DVB) which outlines additional safety requirements for televisions used in healthcare.

===Outdoor television===
Outdoor television sets are designed for outdoor use and are usually found in the outdoor sections of bars, sports field, or other community facilities. Most outdoor televisions use high-definition television technology. Their body is more robust. The screens are designed to remain clearly visible even in sunny outdoor lighting. The screens also have anti-reflective coatings to prevent glare. They are weather-resistant and often also have anti-theft brackets. Outdoor TV models can also be connected with BD players and PVRs for greater functionality.

==Replacing==
In the United States, the average consumer replaces their television every 6.9 years, but research suggests that due to advanced software and apps, the replacement cycle may be shortening.

==Recycling and disposal==
Due to recent changes in electronic waste legislation, economical and environmentally friendly television disposal has been made increasingly more available in the form of television recycling. Challenges with recycling television sets include proper HAZMAT disposal, landfill pollution, and illegal international trade.

<text>X, also known as X/1999, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Clamp, a creative team made up of Satsuki Igarashi, Nanase Ohkawa, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Mokona. It premiered in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; manga magazine in May 1992 and ran there until it went on hiatus in March 2003; it has yet to be concluded. The story takes place at the end of days in the year 1999. The series follows Kamui Shiro, a young esper who returns home to Tokyo after a six-year absence to face his destiny as the one who will determine the humanity&#x27;s fate.

Kadokawa Shoten collected and published the individual chapters in 18 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, with five chapters published in the book &quot;All About Clamp&quot;. These chapters were released in their own 19th volume, entitled &quot;Volume 18.5&quot;, as part of a &quot;Premium Collection&quot; version of the series in November 2023. All but several final chapters have been published. It has been adapted into a series of audio dramas. It was followed by a 1996 anime feature film by Rintaro assisted by Ohkawa in studio Madhouse. The same studio, now led by director and writer Yoshiaki Kawajiri, made a 24-episode anime television series in 2001. Since the manga never reached its ending, the two animated adaptations have their own takes of the series&#x27; finale. Viz Media published the 18 completed volumes in North America, while the film and the TV series been have released on DVD by multiple distributors.

The series is a foray into apocalyptic fiction; it combines elements from various end-of-the-world scenarios, both secular and religious, with its own mythos. Its themes include exploring the personality of humanity, relationships with others, and external conflicts like the impending Armageddon. It is considered one of Clamp&#x27;s most iconic works in their early career, having sold more than 12 million copies and garnering mostly positive reviews for its story, large varied cast and appealing illustrations. Despite its female target audience, it also attracted male readers because of its focus on action.

==Plot==

In 1999, Kamui Shiro returns to Tokyo after a six-year absence to fulfill his mother&#x27;s dying wish of changing fate. However, he keeps his distance from two childhood friends, Kotori and Fuma Monou, whom he originally treasured as a child. The end of the world is fast approaching as superhuman individuals will assure their victory. The clone Nataku steals the from Fuma&#x27;s family temple, with his dying father telling his son that he is Kamui&#x27;s &quot;twin star&quot;. The Dragons of Heaven are the first to contact Kamui. Hinoto, the dreamgazer for the Japanese Legislature guides them. They are the protectors of the , spiritual barriers (in the form of buildings such as the Tokyo Tower) that hold the fabric of nature together. As long as the &quot;kekkai&quot; survive, Judgment Day is postponed. The Dragons of Earth are the antithesis of the Dragons of Heaven. Their mission is to destroy the &quot;kekkai&quot; and unleash earthquakes so Earth can be cured of the plague of humanity. They were assembled by Hinoto&#x27;s sister Kanoe, secretary to the Governor of Tokyo.

Kamui is forced to choose between the two sides. He decides he only wants to protect Kotori and Fuma and becomes a Dragon of Heaven. At the same time, Fuma has a change of personality and becomes the &quot;Kamui&quot; of the Dragons of Earth as he was destined to be Kamui&#x27;s opposite. Fuma murders Kotori and swears to kill Kamui. The Dragon of Heaven Subaru Sumeragi helps Kamui to overcome this traumatic experience, and he decides to face reality. Just like Subaru decided to search for the Dragon of Earth, Seishiro Sakurazuka, who killed his sister Hokuto years ago, Subaru inspires Kamui to face reality and avoid another catastrophe in his life. Kamui decides he wishes to bring Fuma back to normal. Kamui joins the Dragons of Heaven in their fight against the Dragons of Earth. Across the manga, Kamui and his allies face the Dragons of Earths multiple times but cannot protect most barriers, resulting in multiple earthquakes taking down Tokyo. In a one-on-one match, Seishiro activates Hokuto&#x27;s dying spell so that Subaru would be forced kill him. Fuma reveals that Seishiro&#x27;s wish was leaving a mark in Subaru. Following an eye transplant from Seishiro&#x27;s body, Subaru replaces the late Dragon of Earth. The Dragon of Heaven Arashi Kishu loses her maiden powers after having a sexual relationship with her ally Sorata Arisugawa. A dark alter ego Hinoto kidnaps her to turn her into a Dragon of Earth. As these events occur, Tokyo has nearly been destroyed and is flooded, and Kamui and Fuma wield their Sacred Swords needed to clash in the final fight of the war. Both Subaru and Fuma claim that Kamui cannot change the future unless he realizes his own wish.

==Production==
===Development===
The manga artists group Clamp created &quot;X&quot;. Influenced by the works of Go Nagai and Kyokutei Bakin, the story develops the group&#x27;s ideas on humanity&#x27;s responsibility to itself; its family and the planet. After the success of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; and &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;, their editor at &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;, Seiichiro Aoki, approached the members of Clamp to script a longer series. Writer Nanase Ohkawa, the group&#x27;s head writer, seized the opportunity to script her long-in-development &quot;end of the world&quot; epic. Conceived while she was still in middle school, Ohkawa&#x27;s original story focused on a group of warriors fighting a losing battle in the name of justice. While the idea never materialized, many aspects were carried over into Clamp&#x27;s manga, including the lead characters of Kamui and Fuma. Kamui was originally written as a high-school student from Kotori Monou&#x27;s point of view to appeal to the &quot;shōjo&quot; audience of young females. However, poor response from readers led to Clamp changing their characterizations. Ohkawa aimed to show characters from their previous works in the &quot;X&quot; resulting in multiple crossovers. The title—&quot;X&quot;—was chosen because it has no fixed meaning. In mathematics, it is a common variable. Beyond mathematics, &quot;X&quot; is a generic placeholder whose value is secret or unknown. &quot;X&quot; is also a cruciform, an allusion to Christian mythos, and the representation of death and rebirth in Kabbalah.

Ohkawa cites Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Devilman&quot; as a stylistic and thematic influence. Beyond his penchant for drawing extreme violence, Nagai&#x27;s writing involves themes like the nature of good and evil and fear, ideas that left an impression on Clamp&#x27;s writer at an early age. Like &quot;Devilman&quot;, &quot;X&quot; follows two male best friends destined to fight each other at Armageddon, a confrontation brought about by the murder of the hero&#x27;s childhood sweetheart. The rest of the cast includes characters from the group&#x27;s entire canon, including unpublished works, effectively creating an entire world inhabited by their creations. The ensemble cast, inspired on Kyokutei Bakin&#x27;s &quot;Nansō Satomi Hakkenden&quot;, includes Subaru Sumeragi and Seishiro Sakurazuka from &quot;Tokyo Babylon,&quot; and the main characters of &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;. Their first illustration of Kamui gave them a feeling of Ashura, a character from &quot;RG Veda&quot; based on his appearance in Tokyo&#x27;s destroyed area.

Several of the series&#x27; characters were created using Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Star System&quot; technique, where old designs are incorporated in new characters, except for Kamui, who proved challenging because of his role. He was made to stand apart from other characters, and Ohkawa called his hairstyle and school uniform average. Clamp&#x27;s lead artist Mokona believes this was influenced by the heroic character-type upon which he was based. In contrast, Kamui and Fuma were new characters whose designs were revised to fit their characters. Subaru and Seishiro reappear in Clamp&#x27;s manga &quot;X&quot; because their relationship parallels that of the lead Kamui and the main antagonist Fuma. They serve as an example to Kamui and Fuma. One of &quot;X&quot;″s most important plot developments is the question of what these two will do, so as not end up like Subaru and Seishiro. Clamp has compared the bond between Subaru and Kamui with that of siblings. The fight sequences were inspired by the manga &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, most specifically by author Akira Toriyama&#x27;s use of white backgrounds.

===Influences===

&quot;X&quot; is Clamp&#x27;s take on the apocalyptic fiction genre. The series combines elements from various end of the world scenarios and myths, including Christian eschatology; with Clamp&#x27;s own modern mythology to tell the tale of the fate of the world. The Apocalypse of John inspires the &quot;X&quot; mythos with Tokyo standing in as a modern-day Babylon. Like the biblical city; Clamp&#x27;s Tokyo is &quot;the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird&quot;, (Rev. 18:2 KJV) and is slated for destruction.

Clamp found issues with the amount of gore they aimed to portray, especially Kotori&#x27;s death foreshadowed in dream scenes. This was mostly affected by the concern over themes of violence in video games present in the 1990s. The writers feared that toning down the violence would negatively affect the manga. Another death scene that left Clamp facing issues was when Fuma decapitates Saiki, which led to more negative responses from the readers. Ohkawa claimed the deaths were meant to be cruel, but the narrative did not fit the &quot;shojo&quot; demography. The Kobe child murders where Clamp received criticism for the similarities between fictional murders and real life murders also had an effect.

Kamui is established as a Christ figure. He is prophesied to return to Tokyo and the one who will determine humanity&#x27;s fate. His miraculous birth and his given name reinforce the construction of Kamui as a messiah. &quot;Kamui&quot;, like &quot;Christ&quot;, doubles as a title that alludes to the character&#x27;s nature. Apocalyptic allusions abound with respect to nomenclature. The Dragons of Heaven take their moniker from the seven seals introduced in Chapter 5 of the Book of Revelation, while the antagonistic Angels allude to the seven celestial beings ordered to &quot;go [their] ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth&quot; (Rev. 16:1 KJV).

Other apocalyptic standards like earthquakes are employed, but the apocalypse of Clamp&#x27;s manga trades the religious element for an environmental theme. Inspired by the Gaia theory that the Earth itself is one living organism, Ohkawa crafts an endtime brought on by humanity&#x27;s abuse of the planet. The constant earthquakes the Dragons of Earth cause resulted in a negative backlash from readers and editors because of similar incidents in real life. The story reflects environmental concerns in its depiction of Judgment Day. Mankind exists in binary opposition to the Earth. By the end of days, humanity has become such a nuisance that the only way to save the planet is to destroy the whole of civilization. With mankind gone, the planet can regulate itself back to health and experience a rebirth. The Seals, however, look to preserve the status quo and to entrust the future of the planet to the people. &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot;, an award-winning historical fantasy novel, inspired aspects of &quot;X&#x27;s&quot; mythology.

===Themes===
The conflict between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth is at the heart of the series. Like its predecessor &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, &quot;X&quot; deals with societal issues. Being set in the present provides an outlet for the authors to reflect and comment on Japan&#x27;s state of affairs. But unlike &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;, where the characters were vocal in their concerns, topics in &quot;X&quot; go unspoken and are implied. The story places an emphasis on familial dignity and individualism. &quot;X&quot; delves into the relationship between Man and the Earth. Ohkawa talks of how mankind&#x27;s concern for the preservation, restoration and improvement of the planet stems from a desire to perpetuate its own existence. She explains, &quot;people will save the Earth to save themselves, but who will risk themselves to save the Earth&quot;?

&quot;X&quot; plays out like a tragedy, where the characters are at the mercy of forces greater than themselves. The series shares some motifs with apocalyptic literature, like the disclosure of future events through dreams; and establishes a dual nature to its characters and concepts. Ohkawa admits to being fascinated with the doctrine of Dualism. Dualism is the interdependence between opposing elements, the generalization that two opposing-complementary forces are found in all things. She interprets it as &quot;qualities that seem pleasant in one person but can make you hate the next. That&#x27;s the dual nature we all have.&quot; Inspired by the works of Go Nagai, Ohkawa sought to create heroes capable of wrongdoing, even evil. Kamui is the personification of this doctrine. carries a double connotation: &quot;the one who represents the majesty of God&quot;, meaning the one who protects the world and carries out God&#x27;s will; and &quot;the one who hunts the majesty of God&quot;, meaning the one who kills those given God&#x27;s power and destroys the world. Kamui&#x27;s decision to save the world as he knows it is a defining moment as it gives rise to his twin star, Fuma. Fuma undergoes a personality change to the point he is no longer recognizable to his best friend. He takes the name of &quot;Kamui&quot;, thus fulfilling the dual prophecy and bringing balance to the conflict. Fuma&#x27;s &quot;Kamui&quot; persona is Kamui&#x27;s other half; it represents Kamui&#x27;s potential for destruction. &quot;Kamui&quot; is the epitome of the evil and good that men do. The duality motif extends to the Dragons of Heaven and Earth, two groups of warriors, both alike in power, led to battle by opposite sisters.

Dreams are a source of inspiration for Ohkawa; and became a standard motif in her writing. Dreams in &quot;X&quot; depict the future, the destruction of mankind. Hinoto, dreamgazer for the Dragons of Heaven, is convinced it can be changed. Ohkawa explains it as lucid dreaming, where the individual can exert conscious control over the dream to the point it can perform impossible feats. Kakyo of the Dragons of Earth is a dreamgazer in a permanent coma who lives in the dreamscape, always dreaming of the future and knowing there is nothing he can do about it. Although he hopes for a better future, he cannot get involved and is convinced everything is predetermined, including Kamui&#x27;s return.

By arriving in Tokyo, Kamui unwillingly sets Armageddon in motion. Kotori&#x27;s death and Fuma&#x27;s turning were foretold, but subject to the young man&#x27;s allegiance. Thinking of the people he loves, Kamui chooses to become a Dragon of Heaven to protect them, but ends up losing them for it. Other characters are also at the mercy of fate. Sorata Arisugawa is destined to die for a woman; but, unlike Kamui, the warrior monk embraces his preordained future and chooses Arashi Kishu of the Dragons of Heaven as the one for whom he will give his life. Subaru Sumeragi expresses no interest in the future of the Earth, still he and his counterpart, Seishiro Sakurazuka, are drawn to Tokyo on the Promised Day. Even with the fatalist atmosphere that persists in the series, Ohkawa is convinced individuals exert control over their destiny the same way they choose between right and wrong.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;X&quot; began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; in May 1992. Publishing the series proved troublesome because of its subject matter, which depicted material unintentionally reminiscent of real events in Japan. The series went on hiatus multiple times during its serialization in response to social incidents, including the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995 and the Kobe child murders in 1997. Serialization ceased in March 2003, after the editorial staff at &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; indicated to Clamp that Kadokawa Shoten was unlikely to publish their planned ending to the series. Clamp declined to revise the ending, and serialization of &quot;X&quot; stopped in March 2003. In March 2005, Clamp stated that they were still interested in formally concluding the story.

The published chapters were collected in eighteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, with the first one released on 29 July 1992, and the eighteenth on 17 September 2002. On 26 September 2006, Kadokawa Shoten published &quot;Clamp Newtype Platinum&quot;, a special Clamp edition of the magazine &quot;Newtype&quot;. The issue includes the &quot;X 18.5&quot; supplement, a re-print of five previously uncollected chapters. The series was expected to reach twenty-one volumes upon completion. The &quot;X 18.5&quot; chapters were later released as part of the book &quot;All About Clamp&quot; on 22 October 2009. They were released as their own 19th tankobon volume, entitled &quot;Volume 18.5&quot;, on 4 November 2023.

The North American version of the manga, retitled &quot;X/1999&quot; in its initial printing, was serialized in Viz Media&#x27;s &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; and released under the &quot;Shōjo&quot; imprint. The magazine noted that during its initial volumes, there were issues with the handling of the series as the manga went on a hiatus with its sixth volume. In July 2001, Viz Media removed the series from &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; because of licensing issues, but it later returned in its March 2003 issue. Viz Media released the eighteen completed volumes, ending in 2005. Beginning in 2011, Viz re-issued the series in North America as three-in-one volumes, unflipped, titled &quot;X&quot;. In Australia, the series is licensed by Madman Entertainment.

===Music video===
On 21 November 1993, SME Records released , pronounced &quot;Double-X&quot; in English, a short film based on Clamp&#x27;s manga, set to the music of rock band X Japan. &quot;X2&quot; features a slideshow of &quot;X&quot; artwork set to a medley of X Japan&#x27;s songs: &quot;Silent Jealousy,&quot; &quot;Kurenai&quot;, and &quot;Endless Rain&quot; with the &quot;X&quot; music video directed by Shigeyuki Hayashi.

===Feature film===

The &quot;X&quot; feature film, directed by Rintaro and co-scripted by Nanase Ohkawa, premiered in Japan on 3 August 1996. Rintaro is not certain but believes Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s editors asked him to do the film because of his work on &quot;Harmageddon&quot;, a 1983 film that employs different themes from the &quot;X&quot; manga. The supernatural thriller focuses on the roles Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma play in the Apocalypse. The film was given a limited release in the United States in early 2000 and released to DVD on 25 September 2001. &quot;X: The Destiny War&quot;, a comic book based on the feature film, was released on 30 September 1996. The X Japan song &quot;Forever Love&quot;, composed by Yoshiki, was chosen as the film&#x27;s theme song; and was later used by the former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi in a campaign advertisement in 2001.

Victor Entertainment released the &quot;X&quot; from June 1996 to December 1996. The seven audio dramas, scripted by Nanase Ohkawa, focus on the thoughts and motivations of the individual Dragons of Heaven and Earth. The feature film&#x27;s voice actors perform the &quot;Character Files&quot;. They were created to promote the film.

===TV series===

Yoshiaki Kawajiri directed the episodes from the &quot;X&quot; anime television series, which was first announced on 18 October 2000. Kawajiri aimed to portray Kamui and Kotori as stronger than their manga counterparts. However, he still wanted to highlight their psychological weaknesses across later episodes. In anticipation of the series&#x27; premiere, was released direct-to-DVD on 25 August 2001. Written and directed by Kawajiri, &quot;An Omen&quot; tells the story of the upcoming battles through the prophecies of Kakyō Kuzuki, dreamgazer for the Dragon of Earth, and acts as a primer for viewers unfamiliar with Clamp&#x27;s manga. The series premiered 3 October 2001 on WOWOW satellite television and finished on 27 March 2002, totaling twenty-four episodes. Twelve DVD volumes from the series, each containing two episodes were released in Japan from 25 February 2002 to 25 January 2003 by Bandai Visual. Naoki Satō composed the series&#x27; music; two original soundtracks were released.

Pioneer Entertainment distributed the series in North America in March 2002. Geneon collected the series and the OVA in eight DVD volumes released between 24 September 2002 and 25 November 2003. Two DVD box sets of the series were also released on 11 January 2005. In 2006, Geneon released the &quot;X TV Series Re-Mix&quot;, on five individual DVDs released between 11 July 2006 and 14 November 2006, as well as a DVD box set on 11 July 2006. The DVDs came with re-mastered video and audio, including remastered and remixed 5.1 Dolby Digital AC3 surround sound for both the Japanese and English tracks. In September 2009, Funimation announced that it had acquired the rights to the anime series and OVA. They were re-released in a DVD box set on 15 June 2010 using the original Geneon dubbing (provided by Bang Zoom! Entertainment) for the English-language audio track. It is licensed by Siren Visual in Australia, and MVM Films in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
The &quot;X&quot; manga series was a commercial success in Japan, with over 12 million copies in circulation; while in North America it often appeared on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers of 2012 and ICv2 lists.

===Critical reception===
The manga&#x27;s plot and cast were praised. &quot;Animerica&quot; regarded it as one of Clamp&#x27;s most iconic works from their early career. According to the site, &quot;Part of the appeal of the &quot;X&quot; manga series is its surreal blend of Taoist, Shinto, and even European mysticism with real-world locales and historical landmarks familiar to Japanese fans.&quot; According to &quot;Anime Nation&quot;, &quot;X&quot; &quot;appears to defy the conventions of &quot;boys&#x27; manga&quot; and &quot;girls&#x27; manga&quot; because of multiple features provided by the authors such as violence and romance that will appeal to many types of reader. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; noted that while there are no explicit homosexual relationships, the &quot;shōjo&quot; appeal might give the reader this impression when the male characters interact, something the &quot;shônen&quot; demographic might not like.

&quot;Sequental Tart&quot; found Kamui&#x27;s identity mysterious; he is featured as a caring child to Kotori Monou in a flashback, but he appears as a rude teenager when meeting her again. His fight scenes were noted to be violent in contrast to the lighthearted moments that seem to work as comic relief. As a result, the reviewer said that it is difficult to analyze the series&#x27; first volume. &quot;Comic Book Bin&quot; said that despite the aspects of the work and the way the subplots are handled, &quot;X&quot; still maintains an interesting narrative. As the manga progressed, the reviewer felt the manga became more polished and looked forward to the climax when it is written. Kamui&#x27;s growing character arc was the subject of a positive mention as &quot;Manga News&quot; also enjoyed his early appearances and the formation of the Dragons of Heaven as they befriend each other. Reviewers felt Fuma Monou is one of the most brutal antagonists of Clamp&#x27;s career and in &quot;shōjo&quot; in general because of this gruesome murder of Kotori and how he then causes earthquakes to destroy Tokyo. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; found that the series had many types of characters for Dragons of Heaven and Dragons of Earth that are given enough screen time in the buildup to the Holy War to interact and fight until the manga&#x27;s eighth volume when the narrative takes a different route. As the second half begins, the same website also noted that the narrative becomes progressively darker because of the number of dead characters as Clamp moves the plot towards the Armageddon; they also mentioned the events that causes all the deaths.

Fans reading the series have wondered whether Clamp was hinting at a romantic relationship between Kamui and Fuma. &quot;Sequental Art&quot; commented on homoerotic tones during a few scenes. In response, in the book &quot;Understanding Manga and Anime&quot; writer Robin E. Brenner claims Clamp had no intention of suggesting a romantic relationship between the two as he compared them with the more explicit relationship Subaru had with Seishiro. &quot;Manga News&quot; noted the pair had one of the most anticipated fights in the series because of the long history they have in &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; and called their final duel tragic. In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson wrote &quot;even without a proper ending, the series has a lot going for it&quot;, and felt the major storytelling centering around destiny was appealing despite not finding it Clamp&#x27;s best strength.

Clamp&#x27;s illustrations such as the dream sequences, Seishiro&#x27;s horror-based spells, and the outstanding designs of Kamui and Hinoto were also the subject of praise. &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; also enjoyed the artwork, mostly praising the way action sequences are drawn &quot;Manga News&quot; found the early artwork of the series like Clamp&#x27;s other works, such as &quot;RG Veda&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; but with a different style than &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; and &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; as it features mostly androgynous characters. &quot;Comic Book Bin&quot; praised the handling of the fight scenes by the artists especially the backgrounds, which &quot;depict energy and magic unleashed in a fast and furious display&quot;. Because of the manga&#x27;s long serialization, critics noted that the artwork evolved, making it as appealing as later Clamp works like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;. However, &quot;Anime News Network&quot; felt the violent imagery portrayed by Clamp throughout earthquakes and murder scenes in &quot;X&quot; was too disturbing for the &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; demographic and cancelled it. Although the manga returned following its controversial cancellation, the planned ending was even more gruesome causing its cancellation again. Thompson simply regarded the art as &quot;absolutely gorgeous&quot;.

<text>The Avala Tower () is a tall telecommunications tower located on Mount Avala, in Belgrade, Serbia. The original tower was finished in 1965, but was destroyed on 29 April 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The tower&#x27;s reconstruction commenced on 21 December 2006 and it was officially opened on 21 April 2010.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The tower was designed by architects Uglješa Bogunović and Slobodan Janjić, and engineer Milan Krstić. Contractor was the &quot;Rad&quot; construction company. Construction started on 14 October 1961 and was completed four years later, in 1965. The tower weighed . Between and , there was an enclosed observation deck, entered at and reached via two quick elevators. It was the only tower in the world to have an equilateral triangle as its cross section, and one of very few towers not perched directly into the ground, but standing on its legs. The legs formed a tripod, the symbol of Serbian tripod chair (&quot;tronožac&quot;). It is one of the small number of towers to be constructed in that manner.

The tower was surmounted by an antenna, which was at first used for black and white television transmission. In 1971 the antenna was replaced by a new one for color TV transmission and the emitting of the TV Belgrade&#x27;s Second program in color began on 31 December 1971. Also, the first digital terrestrial television in Serbia was emitted from the tower.

The project, which was of high risk, was finished without any worker injuries or deaths, which was unusual for a project of its size.

=== 1999 bombing ===

The Avala Tower was destroyed on 29 April 1999 by NATO bombardment. Previously the power supply to the station was destroyed, but a senior military officer installed a backup generator. The intent of the bombing was to put Radio Television Serbia (RTS) permanently off the air for the duration of the war; however RTS was relayed on a network of local TV stations which relayed its programming throughout the whole of Serbia. The Avala Tower was a symbol of pride and a famous landmark, not only of Belgrade and Serbia, but of the former Yugoslavia too. The tower was one of the last buildings to be destroyed before the end of the NATO operation. The tower was destroyed by two laser-guided bombs GBU-27 that hit one leg of the tower, causing its collapse.

=== Reconstruction ===

The idea of the tower&#x27;s reconstruction at the same place it was destroyed originated from the Journalists&#x27; Association of Serbia in October 2002. In the early 2004, Radio Television Serbia (RTS) joined in with the media promotion of the project and commenced a series of fund-raising events in order to collect money for the construction. The project was endorsed and supported by numerous media, painters, writers, actors, musicians, athletes and businessmen. It is estimated that a million people, through various activities, supported the project.

An agreement regarding its construction was signed by Dušan Basara, director of the construction sector of the Ratko Mitrović Company – which was in charge of the construction of the tower – and general director of RTS, Aleksandar Tijanić. Many fund-raising events have been held for the collection of funds so a new tower can be constructed. One of the first was a match between Serbian grand slam-winning tennis players Ana Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic. All the proceeds went to the Avala Tower fund. Ceca Ražnatović (a Serbian folk singer) held a concert on 15 June 2006, with all the proceeds going to the Avala Tower fund. RTS ran commercials for donations to rebuild the tower. According to a December 2006 report, when it was announced that the construction of a new Avala Tower would commence that same month, over €1 million was collected through fund-raising and donations.

Clearing of the site began on 21 June 2005. Over one million tons of rubble was removed. Seismic survey followed and the construction works started on 21 December 2006. Initially, completion of the new tower was expected in August 2008, but construction works were severely delayed. The opening date was pushed back to 29 April 2009, the tenth anniversary of its destruction. Radio Television Serbia reported on 23 October 2009 that the tower had been completed.

The rebuilt tower was opened on 21 April 2010 and with , it is higher than the demolished one. Materials used include 5,880 tons of concrete and 500 tons of reinforcement bars. The height of the reinforced concrete section is , while the steel antenna construction, and the antenna itself, are tall.

== Today ==

The tower had 137,000 visitors in 2016, 155,000 in 2017 and 185,000 in 2018. In June 2017 the tourist complex was opened at the base of the tower. It includes, among other facilities, a restaurant, ethno-gallery, souvenir shop, sports fields and outdoor gym. By August 2017, 105 cement prints of the people who helped the reconstruction were displayed, including those of tennis players Novak Djokovic and Ana Ivanovic and a new lift, for the parents with children and the disabled, have been constructed.

In 2018 the children area at the base was expanded with the elf village, consisting of houses connected by a small bridge. A classroom in the open was set in the pine forest and the artificial climbing rock was built. On 19 October 2018, a colorful decorative light on the entire tower became operational.

<doc id="628493" wikidata="Q2475450" url="?curid=628493" title="Dan Hawkins (musician)">
<text>Daniel Francis Hawkins (born 12 December 1976) is an English guitarist, best known as a guitarist and backing singer of the rock band the Darkness. The band, founded and fronted by his older brother Justin Hawkins, achieved notable mainstream success between 2002 and 2006. He also formerly played lead guitar for Stone Gods.

He is also a producer. He works with Christian Fleetwood McCabe and Deep Fried Sunshine .

==Musical style and influences==
He is influenced by hard rock and glam metal bands, including Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Whitesnake, AC/DC, Queen, Mötley Crüe and Thin Lizzy.

==Biography==
After moving to Lowestoft, Hawkins attended Kirkley High School and achieved good grades in his GCSEs before leaving his hometown behind for the bright lights and cosmopolitan lifestyle of Camden, London. From a young age, he aspired to be a musician, beginning on drums, moving on to bass and finally mastering the guitar. Back in his early days in his professional career, he worked as a session guitarist for various artists including Natalie Imbruglia. Previous bands include Vital Signs and Empire before The Darkness consisting of Justin Hawkins, Ed Graham, Frankie Poullain and later, Richie Edwards, became a mainstream success. With The Darkness he has won Brits, MTV and Kerrang awards and the prestigious Ivor Novello Award for songwriting in 2004. The Darkness split in 2006.

In 2006, after The Darkness disbanded, Dan regrouped with bandmates Edwards and Graham to begin the band that would, after the recruitment of bassist Toby Macfarlaine, become Stone Gods. He played lead guitar in the band and saw their debut album &quot;Silver Spoons &amp; Broken Bones&quot;, which was well received by critics. Stone Gods went on hiatus in 2011, preceding the reunion of The Darkness.

Hawkins was involved with the production process during the recording of The Darkness&#x27;s albums, learning the skills alongside famed producer, Roy Thomas Baker. He co-produced B-sides for &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot;. His first credited project was Stone Gods&#x27; album &quot;Silver Spoons &amp; Broken Bones&quot; with the record producer, Nick Brine. Hawkins also built and owns a luxury, commercial residential recording studio &#x27;Leeders Farm&#x27; in Wymondham, Norfolk where The Darkness albums were recorded, which is run by Brine and his partner Katy Dann. Bands such as The Dandies, Arctic Monkeys, Seasick Steve, The Rifles, Teenage fanclub, Wild Beasts, and more recently ex Thunder guitarist Luke Morley&#x27;s new band The Union have all recorded there.

Hawkins is credited with composing the theme tune to the CBeebies television show, &quot;Grace&#x27;s Amazing Machines&quot;.

==Equipment==

Hawkins&#x27; guitar of choice is the Gibson Les Paul and his main instrument, both live and in the studio, is his well used 2000 Honeyburst Standard (nicknamed &quot;Dune&quot; after the David Lynch film) which he played extensively in The Darkness and in Stone Gods. Over the years he has owned and played several Les Paul Standards and currently tours with 6-8 of them including a second 2000 Honeyburst (nicknamed &#x27;Terry&#x27;), a Wine Red 1997 Standard (known as UB40 which is used for the songs &#x27;Givin&#x27; Up&#x27; and &#x27;Friday Night&#x27;), a late 1970s Sunburst B-stock formerly owned by the guitarist from the band Sputnik), a 2003 Goldtop (belonging to his guitar tech, but borrowed for tours), a late 1990s Standard re-finished in white, and a 2013 Honeyburst Flametop.

During 2003-2006 he used a Gretsch Elliot Easton solid body for the song &quot;Black Shuck&quot; but this was sold to fund the recording of the second Stone Gods album. Another guitar that has not been seen during this reunion is a 2000 Standard in black (nicknamed &#x27;Black Shuck&#x27;) that was previously also used live. He also owns a Gibson Les Paul Custom Black Beauty which was originally handbuilt for Jimmy Page, but Page decided it was too heavy and rejected the instrument; Page is one of Hawkins&#x27;s biggest influences. It is fitted with a Fishman Powerblend pickup and is used for the song &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot;. It is also known that when Dan was waiting for the arrival of a different humbucker to put into the instrument his then-guitar tech said that he had a Kent Armstrong prototype humbucker that was taken out of one of Angus Young&#x27;s Gibson SG&#x27;s. He fitted Angus&#x27;s old humbucker to the guitar and liked the sound so much that he left it in.

Among a variety of amplifiers, his primary choices are Marshalls, particularly the 1959 SLP and Handwired Re-Issue models (as is exemplified in videos of The Darkness live at The Astoria, London in 2003). For his &#x27;dirtier&#x27; sounds in Stone Gods, he played a Marshall JCM 800 Re-Issue head through Marshall 1960AX/BX cabinets, combined with a Diezel Herbert head. He has also been seen using both a Vox AC30 combo and a Wizard Modern Classic head to complement his several Marshall stacks. Effects wise, a vintage Ibanez TS-808 Tube Screamer pedal is his mainstay for overdrive, but photos of his 2012/2013 touring rig show additional pedals from Electro-Harmonix, MXR, Strymon and Devi Ever among others.

A large amount of Hawkins&#x27; distinct tone comes from his use of heavy gauge strings. He uses Ernie Ball Beefy Slinkys (typically; 11, 15, 22p, 30w, 42w, 54w) and Jim Dunlop Maxi Grip 0.73mm picks.

<text>Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (Leka Skënder Zogu; 5 April 193930 November 2011) was the only son of King Zog I and Queen Geraldine of Albania. He was called Crown Prince Skander at birth. After his father&#x27;s death in 1961, Leka was the pretender to the Albanian throne, and his supporters referred to him as &quot;King Leka I&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Leka was born on April 5, 1939, in the Royal Palace of Tirana in the Kingdom of Albania. He was named Crown Prince Skander and his birth was celebrated with a 101-gun salute and a military parade. Leka was the son of King Zog I of Albania and Queen Geraldine of Albania; and was also an eighth cousin of U.S. President Richard Nixon through his maternal grandmother, a New York socialite.

Just two days after his birth, King Zog I was forced into exile after Benito Mussolini&#x27;s army invaded the country during the Italian invasion of Albania. Shortly after, Zog was replaced on the throne of Albania by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy — an action the King of Italy would later plead personal forgiveness for. Victor Emmanuel III remained King until his abdication in 1943, following the Armistice of Cassibile.

Crown Prince Leka began life in exile in various countries. After traveling across Europe, the Albanian Royal Family settled in England, first at the Ritz Hotel in London, then moving for a very short period in 1941 to South Ascot, near Ascot in Berkshire, and then in 1941 to Parmoor House, Parmoor, near Frieth in Buckinghamshire.

After the End of World War II in Europe, Zog, Queen Geraldine and Leka moved temporarily to Egypt, where they lived at the invitation of King Farouk I.

Leka attended school at Victoria College, Alexandria in Egypt and at Aiglon College in Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland. He studied economics at the University of Geneva and at the Sorbonne, and attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England. Following this he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the British Army. He had since made his money with successful business deals in commodities.

Leka became heir apparent of the abolished throne on 5 April, 1957. On the death of King Zog in 1961, Leka was proclaimed King of the Albanians by a convened Albanian National Assembly-in-exile, in a function room at the Hotel Bristol, Paris.

===Marriage and exile===
In 1975, Leka married Australian citizen and former teacher Susan Cullen-Ward. They were married in a civil ceremony in the Hôtel de Ville, Biarritz. The wedding reception, at a five-star Toledo Roadhouse, was attended by members of other exiled royal families, loyal Albanians and friends, who toasted &quot;Long live the King&quot;. The couple returned to Madrid, where they were befriended by the Spanish King Juan Carlos I and continued to enjoy the attentions of Albanians. The couple married religiously in Madrid. Their wedding was officiated by a Muslim ulema, a Protestant pastor (due to the fact that Susan was Episcopalian), and a Roman Catholic priest (as Queen Geraldine was Catholic).

When it was discovered that Leka not only retained some Thai bodyguards, but had what was described as an arms cache in their home, the Spanish government asked him to leave. When his plane arrived at Gabon for refueling, he found that it was being surrounded by local troops, who were said to have been hired to capture him by the Albanian government. The soldiers backed down when Leka appeared at the plane&#x27;s door with a bazooka in his hand. The couple went on to Rhodesia but, after Robert Mugabe took power, they settled in a large compound near Johannesburg where they were given diplomatic status by the South African Government.

Leka spent many years exiled in Bryanston, South Africa, where his son Prince Leka was born, before eventually returning to Albania in 2002.

===Return to Albania===
In 1993 Leka was permitted to enter Albania for the first time (since being exiled aged a few days old in 1939), doing so under a passport issued by his own Royal Court-in-exile. In this royal passport, which the Albanian government had previously refused to recognise, Leka listed his profession as &quot;King&quot;.

During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, Leka returned again, this time being greeted by 2,000 supporters. Many of Leka&#x27;s royalist supporters felt that a restoration of the monarchy would help bring political and financial stability to the government, as well as help protect Albanian democracy, following decades of communist rule.

On June 29, a referendum was held in Albania concerning a restoration of the monarchy. Before the results had been finalized, Albanian government officials announced that the referendum had been rejected. Leka questioned the results of the election and claimed the vote had been manipulated. Leka protested, surrounded by roughly 20 guards, who were armed with assault rifles, grenades, and machine-guns. Leka himself was dressed in camouflage and carried two pistols. Albanian police had previously deployed armored vehicles and forces with heavy machine-guns, in case of any trouble ahead of the election.

On July 3, Leka led a crowd of 900 protesters, some armed, outside the main elections building, to protest, claiming election fraud had occurred. Royalist protesters sang at the rally, chanting &quot;Brother, pick up the weapons. We&#x27;ll fight or die, we&#x27;ll win&quot;, as they waved pro-monarchy flags. 300 royalists then marched alongside Leka in the central Skanderbeg Square, causing police intervention. This led to a shootout between royalists and police, which lasted approximately 15 minutes. Gunfire and several grenade explosions went off, as nearby civilians scrambled for cover. Police killed one royalist protestor, Agim Gjoonpalaj, and several others were injured in the gunfight. Gjoonpalaj was both a monarchist and a pro-democracy advocate.

Gjoonpalaj&#x27;s funeral was held two days later, on June 5. President Sali Berisha called upon members of the Democratic Party of Albania to attend the funeral. Leka also attended, greeting mourners and walking with the coffin bearers. The funeral procession proceeded through Skanderberg Square, where the violence had previously broken out two days before. Royalists at the funeral walked through the square, shouting &quot;Down with Communism!&quot;

After a recount it was announced by the government that the restoration was rejected by approximately two-thirds of those voting.

Albanian President Sali Berisha expressed his thoughts on the failed referendum in 2011:

When Leka was later asked if he intended to leave Albania, he replied: &quot;Why? It is my country&quot;, though he soon left Albania of his own accord on July 12. Following that, Leka was tried and sentenced by the Albanian government to three years imprisonment for sedition, in absentia. This conviction was later set aside in March 2002, when 72 members of Parliament asked the royal family to return. In June 2002, Leka returned to Albania and brought with him 11 cases of automatic weapons, grenades, and hunting arms. The authorities quickly seized them, though the weapons were returned to the royal family six years later, after being deemed items of cultural heritage. After his 2002 settlement in Albania, he lived out a quiet life with his wife and son. His wife died two years later in July 2004.

===Further political activity===

Leka was backed by the Party of Right and Legality (PLL), a right wing monarchist party and a marginal factor in Albanian politics. It formed a coalition with other parties in Albania. Leka, however, did not vote, stating that 

Leka was head of the Movement for National Development. He argued that he was a fighter for a Greater Albania in terms of ethnicity and that his restoration as king would make possible this goal. However, in February 2006, he announced he would be withdrawing from political and public life.

===Death===
Leka died on 30 November 2011 from a heart attack in Mother Teresa Hospital, Tirana. Albanian authorities held official ceremonies for the former Crown Prince, and declared December 3, the day of his funeral, a day of national mourning. Tirana&#x27;s mayor Lulzim Basha stated at the funeral that &quot;We have come here today ... to honor, with full historic gratitude and national pride, the work of Leka Zogu.&quot; Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox prayers were all read by religious leaders at the funeral. Leka&#x27;s son, Leka, Prince of Albania stated &quot;I, Prince Leka II, swear in front of the body of my father that I will follow the road of King Zogu, of King Leka I to be at the service of the nation, the homeland.&quot;

Leka was buried next to his wife&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s grave at the public Sharra cemetery in a Tirana suburb. Later he was buried at the Mausoleum of the Albanian Royal Family.

==Personal life==
Leka was a Muslim and appealed for Islamic solidarity. He also spoke a half-dozen languages, including Albanian, Arabic and English.

Leka stood at a height of , much taller than his slim wife Susan Cullen-Ward. Author Charles Fenyvesi gave a description of his appearance and manner in his 1979 book, &quot;Splendor in Exile&quot;:

In the 1960s, Leka struck up a friendship with California Governor Ronald Reagan (later President of the United States), gifting him a baby elephant named &quot;Gertie&quot;. This name was deemed unrefined by Nancy Reagan, who chose to rename the animal &quot;GOP&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Aisne&quot; (D22) was a 1943 or later fleet destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was named after one of the Battles of the Aisne.

Vickers-Armstrongs built &quot;Aisne&quot; at High Walker on the River Tyne. She was launched on 12 May 1945, the first warship since VE Day, and commissioned on 20 March 1947.

==Service history==
&quot;Aisne&quot; joined the Home Fleet upon commission, but in 1950 she was temporarily laid-up. The following year, &quot;Aisne&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Squadron, where she would subsequently have spells with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1953, &quot;Aisne&quot; took part in the Fleet Review at Spithead to celebrate the Coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;Aisne&quot; was positioned in the middle of her sister-ships and .

In 1954, &quot;Aisne&quot;, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, deployed to the Mediterranean, remaining there until 1955. In 1959, &quot;Aisne&quot; began a conversion to a Radar Picket, in effect extending the service life of Aisne, as well as those of the other converted ships, for just a little while longer than the rest of the class. The conversion gave her new radar, as well as the SeaCat missile system and new AA weaponry.

In 1962, &quot;Aisne&quot; joined the 7th Destroyer Squadron, and the following year joined the 23rd Escort Squadron, and subsequently the 30th Escort Squadron, deployed to the Mediterranean in 1964, before deploying to join the Far East Fleet. In 1967, &quot;Aisne&quot; deployed to the West Indies remaining there until the following year. In that same year, 1968, &quot;Aisne&quot; was decommissioned, and was then scrapped by ship breakers Thos. W. Ward at Inverkeithing in 1970.

<text>Sergei Petrovich Novikov (Russian: Серге́й Петро́вич Но́виков ; 20 March 19386 June 2024) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician, noted for work in both algebraic topology and soliton theory. He became the first Soviet mathematician to receive the Fields Medal in 1970.

==Biography==
Novikov was born on 20 March 1938 in Gorky, Soviet Union (now Nizhny Novgorod, Russia). He grew up in a family of talented mathematicians. His father was Pyotr Sergeyevich Novikov, who gave a negative solution to the word problem for groups. His mother, Lyudmila Vsevolodovna Keldysh, and maternal uncle, Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh, were also important mathematicians.

Novikov entered Moscow State University in 1955 and graduated in 1960. In 1964, he received the Moscow Mathematical Society Award for young mathematicians and defended a dissertation for the &quot;Candidate of Science in Physics and Mathematics&quot; degree (equivalent to the PhD) under Mikhail Postnikov at Moscow State University. In 1965, he defended a dissertation for the &quot;Doctor of Science in Physics and Mathematics&quot; degree there.

Novikov died on 6 June 2024, at the age of 86.

==Career==
In 1966, Novikov became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In 1971, he became head of the Mathematics Division of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1983, Novikov was also appointed the head of the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology at Moscow State University. He became President of the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1985 and remained in that role until 1996, when he moved to the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland, College Park. He continued to maintain research appointments at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Moscow State University, and the Department of Geometry and Topology at the Steklov Mathematical Institute after his move to Maryland.

==Research==
Novikov&#x27;s early work was in cobordism theory, in relative isolation. Among other advances he showed how the Adams spectral sequence, a powerful tool for proceeding from homology theory to the calculation of homotopy groups, could be adapted to the new (at that time) cohomology theory typified by cobordism and K-theory. This required the development of the idea of cohomology operations in the general setting, since the basis of the spectral sequence is the initial data of Ext functors taken with respect to a ring of such operations, generalising the Steenrod algebra. The resulting Adams–Novikov spectral sequence is now a basic tool in stable homotopy theory.

Novikov also carried out important research in geometric topology, being one of the pioneers with William Browder, Dennis Sullivan, and C. T. C. Wall of the surgery theory method for classifying high-dimensional manifolds. He proved the topological invariance of the rational Pontryagin classes, and posed the Novikov conjecture. From about 1971, he moved to work in the field of isospectral flows, with connections to the theory of theta functions. Novikov&#x27;s conjecture about the Riemann–Schottky problem (characterizing principally polarized abelian varieties that are the Jacobian of some algebraic curve) stated, essentially, that this was the case if and only if the corresponding theta function provided a solution to the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation of soliton theory. This was proved by Takahiro Shiota (1986), following earlier work by Enrico Arbarello and Corrado de Concini (1984), and by Motohico Mulase (1984).

==Awards and honours==
In 1967, Novikov received the Lenin Prize. In 1970, Novikov became the first Soviet mathematician to be awarded the Fields Medal. He was not allowed to travel to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice to accept his medal by the Soviet government due to his support for people who had been arrested and sent to mental institutions for speaking out against the regime, but he received it in 1971 when the International Mathematical Union met in Moscow. In 2005, he was awarded the Wolf Prize for his contributions to algebraic topology, differential topology and to mathematical physics. He is one of just eleven mathematicians who received both the Fields Medal and the Wolf Prize. In 2020, he received the Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In 1981, he was elected a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Russian Academy of Sciences since 1991). He was elected to the London Mathematical Society (honorary member, 1987), Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (honorary member, 1988), Accademia dei Lincei (foreign member, 1991), Academia Europaea (member, 1993), National Academy of Sciences (foreign associate, 1994), Pontifical Academy of Sciences (member, 1996), (fellow, 2003), and Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts (honorary member, 2011).

He received honorary doctorates from the University of Athens (1988) and University of Tel Aviv (1999).

<doc id="628519" wikidata="Q258335" url="?curid=628519" title="Lillian Copeland">
<text>Lillian Copeland (née Drossin; November 24, 1904 – July 7, 1964) was an American track and field Olympic champion athlete, who excelled in discus, javelin throwing, and shot put, setting multiple world records. She has been called &quot;the most successful female discus thrower in U.S. history&quot;. She also held multiple titles in shot put and javelin throwing. She won a silver medal in discus at the 1928 Summer Olympics, a gold medal in discus at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and gold medals in discus, javelin, and shot put at the 1935 Maccabiah Games in Mandatory Palestine.

In 1928, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Copeland was &quot;considered by many the all around best woman athlete in the country.&quot; Until the 2008 Beijing Games 74 years after she became an Olympic champion, she was the only American woman to win the discus throw at a modern Olympics. She has been inducted into the USATF Hall of Fame, the Helms Athletic Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early and personal life==
Copeland was born Lillian Drossin to Polish-Jewish immigrants in New York City. Her mother was from Grodno (now in Belarus). Her father died when she was young, and after her mother remarried they moved to Los Angeles, California, and changed their surnames to Drossin. Her stepfather was Abraham Copeland, the manager of a fruit and produce company. She lived in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, and later in Pasadena, California, and attended Los Angeles High School, graduating in 1923.

She attended the University of Southern California, where she was a member of the Xi chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority and joined the track &amp; field team in 1924. While at USC, she won every track event she entered. She had a role as a basketball player in the silent 1927 comedy film &quot;The Fair Co-Ed&quot;. She received a BA degree in political science in 1928. She was the first Olympian who was an alumna of Los Angeles High School and the University of Southern California.

==Athletic career==
Copeland competed during the formative decades of women&#x27;s competition in track and field. Consequently, her accomplishments are not fully reflected by the two Olympic medals she won in the discus throw. She competed first for the Pasadena Athletic and Country Club beginning in 1925, and from 1931 on for the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She also competed in running; in 1928 she was part of a women&#x27;s relay team that set the US record in the quarter-mile. One of the track &amp; field events in which she competed, which is no longer contested, was the baseball throw, in which she was second in the nation in 1926. She won nine Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championships between 1925 and 1932. A feature article in the May 18, 1926, &quot;Pasadena Post&quot; noted that she &quot;with all of her athletic prowess ... is very ... feminine in her conduct.&quot; 

She excelled in all throwing events. She won the AAU shot put championships 5 times (1924–28, 1931). She also won the AAU discus throw title in 1926 (a year in which she set the world record; she began competing in discus because the shot put was not yet an Olympic event) and 1927, and set a new world record in the discus throw at the 1938 Olympic trials. In addition, she won the AAU javelin throw title in 1926 (setting a world record) and 1931. In the javelin, she broke the world record three times in 1926 and 1927. Between 1928 and 1931, she took a hiatus from competing, to focus on her law school studies. 

In 1928, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Copeland was &quot;considered by many the all around best woman athlete in the country.&quot; Both &quot;Great Athletes in Olympic Sports&quot; (Salem Press; 2010), by Kjetil André Aamodt and Laura Flessel-Colovic, and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame report that she set the world record six times each in shot put, javelin, and discus from 1925–32.

===Olympics===
====1928 Olympics====

The 1928 Summer Olympics were the first Olympics to include women&#x27;s track and field events. In weight throwing Copeland could only compete in the discus throw, because the javelin throw and shot put were not yet on the program (they would follow in 1932 and 1948, respectively). 

She set a new world record in the discus throw at the Olympic trials, at 115 feet, 8.5 inches. 

Prior to the Olympiad, in February 1928 she ran the lead leg in the relay in the 1928 Olympic trials. In so doing, she helped the US Women&#x27;s team set a new record in the event of 50.0 seconds, and actually qualified for the Olympics in that event. Sources disagree, however, whether it was a world or US national record.

Once she arrived in Amsterdam, however, she only competed in the discus throw at the 1928 Olympics, where she finished second to Poland&#x27;s Halina Konopacka, winning a silver medal. Inasmuch as it was the first time the event had been held, she was the sport&#x27;s first Olympic silver medalist. Two weeks later, at a competition in Brussels, Belgium, she set a new world record in the shot put.

Returning to America, she attended and ultimately graduated from the University of Southern California Law School, and became less focused on sports for a number of years. Nevertheless, Copeland qualified for the US 1932 Olympic team for the discus throw. 

====1932 Olympics====

She competed in her home town in the 1932 Summer Olympics after beating out Babe Didrikson to qualify, and won the gold medal in the discus with her last throw. A &quot;Los Angeles Record&quot; reporter wrote: &quot;Confident, calm and perfectly poised, [she] made a perfect throw.&quot; In doing so she also set a new Olympic record. That throw of was also a new world record. The 27-year-old Copeland was at the time the oldest American woman to have won an Olympic gold medal in a track &amp; field event. 

The shot put, which she excelled in, was not included in the women&#x27;s events at the Olympic Games until 1948, depriving her of a chance to compete in it for additional Olympic medals.

====1936 Olympics====
Although she had begun preparations to defend her Los Angeles gold medal at the 1936 Berlin Games in Nazi Germany, and was invited to compete for the United States at the Games, she ultimately chose to boycott them. Her plans to boycott the 1936 Olympic Games arose in 1933, just as the Nazi Party was obtaining more power. She was one of 24 former U.S. Olympic champions who petitioned the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1933 to move the Games from Germany. Copeland suggested that the situation of Nazi Germany was serious enough to warrant a change in location for the 1936 Olympics. She supported a reputed idea to substitute the location of the 1936 Games to Tokyo instead of Germany. As a Jew, she was strongly opposed to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s edict barring Jews from the German Olympic team. She accused International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Avery Brundage of &quot;deliberately concealing the truth&quot; about Hitler and Nazi Germany. She also argued that Brundage had little respect for the harmful effects of Nazi Germany&#x27;s intense regime on members of the Jewish community. Copeland raised awareness on the danger of ignoring religious and racial hatred perpetrated by Nazi Germany. She wanted people to know that the racial discrimination encouraged by members of Nazi Germany should not be overlooked, even in sports. The boycott movement fell through, however, and the 1936 Games proceeded in Germany. 

===Maccabiah Games===

Copeland competed at the 1935 Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv in Mandatory Palestine. There, she won the gold medals in her three events, the shot put, the javelin, and the discus throw.

In view of her contributions to women&#x27;s track and field, she was made a member of the USA Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame, the Helms Athletic Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame (1980), the Woman’s Track and Field Hall of Fame, and the Los Angeles High School Sports Hall of Fame (2010). In 1990 she was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

==Later career==
Copeland joined the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department in 1936, and worked there until she retired in 1960. At the Sheriff&#x27;s Department, she worked in the Lennox and Firestone Juvenile divisions.

She died on July 7, 1964, in Los Angeles, at 59 years of age at Sunset Hospital after a lengthy illness. At the time of her death, she was one of only eight American women to have won an Olympic gold medal.

<doc id="628536" wikidata="Q4854757" url="?curid=628536" title="Bandwidth-limited pulse">
<text>A bandwidth-limited pulse (also known as Fourier-transform-limited pulse, or more commonly, transform-limited pulse) is a pulse of a wave that has the minimum possible duration for a given spectral bandwidth. Bandwidth-limited pulses have a constant phase across all frequencies making up the pulse. Optical pulses of this type can be generated by mode-locked lasers.

Any waveform can be disassembled into its spectral components by Fourier analysis or Fourier transformation. The length of a pulse thereby is determined by its spectral components, which include not just their relative intensities, but also the relative positions (spectral phase) of these spectral components. For different pulse shapes, the minimum duration-bandwidth product is different. The duration-bandwidth product is minimal for zero phase-modulation. For example, formula_1 pulses have a minimum duration-bandwidth product of 0.315 while gaussian pulses have a minimum value of 0.441.

A bandwidth-limited pulse can only be kept together if the dispersion of the medium the wave is travelling through is zero; otherwise dispersion management is needed to revert the effects of unwanted spectral phase changes. For example, when an ultrashort pulse passes through a block of glass, the glass medium broadens the pulse due to group velocity dispersion.

Keeping pulses bandwidth-limited is necessary to compress information in time or to achieve high field densities, as with ultrashort pulses in modelocked lasers.

<text>The British Construction Industry Awards (BCI Awards or BCIA) were launched by &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; magazine and Thomas Telford Ltd in 1998, at the time both owned by the Institution of Civil Engineers.

The awards seek to recognise outstanding achievement in the construction of buildings, taking account of a wide range of factors including architectural and engineering design, but also consideration of the construction process, delivery to time and budget, and client satisfaction.

In 2012, Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins was the chair of the British Construction Industry Awards judging panel which celebrated its 25th anniversary of rewarding excellence in UK construction delivery.

In June 2017 owners of New Civil Engineer, Ascential, sold the title to Metropolis International who now operate the BCIAs in association with the Institution of Civil Engineers.

The awards are typically held in October each year. In 2020, the British Construction Industry Awards will be held on the evening of Wednesday 28 October at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in London.

<doc id="628578" wikidata="Q964869" url="?curid=628578" title="Xavier Grall">
<text>Xavier Grall (1930–1981) was a journalist and poet from Brittany, France, who was a strong advocate of Breton nationalism during the Third Emsav. His work glorifies a mystical Brittany.

==Early career==
Xavier Grall was born in Landivisiau in Finistère, but moved to Paris. He worked as a journalist for Catholic publications, including the journals &quot;La Vie catholique&quot;, of which he was editor, and &quot;Témoignage chrétien&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Bretagne&quot;.

==Bretonism==
Grall rediscovered his Breton identity in the 1970s, leaving Paris permanently in 1973, returning to Brittany to live at Bossulan Farm in Nizon, just outside Pont-Aven. Grall&#x27;s reassertion of Breton identity followed a period of disillusionment with France following the Algerian War. He later wrote that the war undermined his belief in the idea of France:

I had done the Algerian War, in the wolfish sun my eyes were opened. Heartbreaking revelation. From Djebel Amour [in Algeria] to Montagnes Noires [in Brittany], there were similarities. Same tyrant: the French state. Same victim: the peasant. Same cops: CRS ... When we saw France torture, we could not put that song on the level to which we&#x27;d been lulled ... The image of France that I had formed, very high and almost mystical, found itself forever tarnished.

In response he defined himself as Breton in opposition to French identity:
You discover Bretonness as it is not allowed to be. ... And you think that your country does exist, dear God, terribly. You recover. You look straight ahead. You are decolonized. You are Berber, Kabyle, Breton.

From this point on his work emphasises a multicultural ideal, building a unique example of Breton literature in French.

==Activism==
With his friends Alain Guel and the protest singer Glenmor, he founded &quot;éditions Kelenn&quot;, where he published &quot;Barde imaginé&quot; (1968), &quot;Keltia Blues&quot; (1971), &quot;La Fête de la nuit&quot; (1972) and &quot;Rires et pleurs de l&#x27;Aven&quot; (1978). Alain Guel, who followed his early steps in literature, and kept up a voluminous correspondence with him, gave him support and friendship throughout his life.

Reconnecting with his past as a columnist, Grall published &quot;Le Cheval couché&quot; (the lounging horse), a scathing response to Pierre-Jakez Hélias&#x27;s popular autobiographical novel &quot;Cheval d&#x27;orgueil&quot; (Horse of Pride), which he called &quot;fossilized folkism&quot;. He also vilified earlier Breton poets and singers, notably Theodore Botrel, whom he described as the creator of a &quot;pitiable&quot; image of Brittany born &quot;from the depths of his idiocy&quot;. Botrel later expressed regret for having written the book.

Grall continued to work from a distance for &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;La Vie catholique&quot;. He published pamphlets and occasional pieces; &quot;Le Billet d&#x27;Olivier&quot; presented his passions and his moods on current topics. He also wrote essays on François Mauriac, James Dean and others.

In the early 1970s, Grall founded the Breton separatist newspaper &quot;Le Nation bretonne&quot; with Alain Guel and Glenmor, where he published lyrics under the pseudonym of &quot;Saint HERBOTS&quot;, among others.

He died in Quimperlé in 1981.

==Commemorations==
A bronze sculpture to his memory stands on the Promenade Xavier Grall, on the banks of the river Aven in Pont-Aven.

Each year in Carhaix a &quot;Festival des Vieilles Charrues&quot; bears his name.

A literary prize was created in his name at the &quot;Festival de la Parole Poétique&quot; (Pays de Quimperlé). &quot;Le Prix Xavier-Grall&quot; is awarded to a poet for his life&#x27;s work. Recipients have included:
*Jean-Paul Kermarrec in 2006.
*Jacqueline Saint-Jean in 2007
*Marie-Josée Christien in 2009
*Alain Jégou in 2008
*Pierre Colin in 2010

<text>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging technique with most of its applications in medicine and biology. OCT uses coherent near-infrared light to obtain micrometer-level depth resolved images of biological tissue or other scattering media. It uses interferometry techniques to detect the amplitude and time-of-flight of reflected light.

OCT uses transverse sample scanning of the light beam to obtain two- and three-dimensional images. Short-coherence-length light can be obtained using a superluminescent diode (SLD) with a broad spectral bandwidth or a broadly tunable laser with narrow linewidth. The first demonstration of OCT imaging (in vitro) was published by a team from MIT and Harvard Medical School in a 1991 article in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. The article introduced the term &quot;OCT&quot; to credit its derivation from optical coherence-domain reflectometry, in which the axial resolution is based on temporal coherence. The first demonstrations of in vivo OCT imaging quickly followed.

The first US patents on OCT by the MIT/Harvard group described a time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) system. These patents were licensed by Zeiss and formed the basis of the first generations of OCT products until 2006.

In the decade preceding the invention of OCT, interferometry with short-coherence-length light had been investigated for a variety of applications. The potential to use interferometry for imaging was proposed, and measurement of retinal elevation profile and thickness had been demonstrated.

The initial commercial clinical OCT systems were based on point-scanning TD-OCT technology, which primarily produced cross-sectional images due to the speed limitation (tens to thousands of axial scans per second). Fourier-domain OCT became available clinically 2006, enabling much greater image acquisition rate (tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands axial scans per second) without sacrificing signal strength. The higher speed allowed for three-dimensional imaging, which can be visualized in both en face and cross-sectional views. Novel contrasts such as angiography, elastography, and optoretinography also became possible by detecting signal change over time. Over the past three decades, the speed of commercial clinical OCT systems has increased more than 1000-fold, doubling every three years and rivaling Moore&#x27;s law of computer chip performance. Development of parallel image acquisition approaches such as line-field and full-field technology may allow the performance improvement trend to continue.

OCT is most widely used in ophthalmology, in which it has transformed the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal diseases, optic nerve diseases, and corneal diseases. It has greatly improved the management of the top three causes of blindness – macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma – thereby preventing vision loss in many patients. By 2016 OCT was estimated to be used in more than 30 million imaging procedures per year worldwide.

Intravascular OCT imaging is used in the intravascular evaluation of coronary artery plaques and to guide stent placement. Beyond ophthalmology and cardiology, applications are also developing in other medical specialties such as dermatology, gastroenterology, neurology and neurovascular imaging, oncology, and dentistry.

==Introduction==

Interferometric reflectometry of biological tissue, especially of the human eye using short-coherence-length light (also referred to as partially-coherent, low-coherence, or broadband, broad-spectrum, or white light) was investigated in parallel by multiple groups worldwide since 1980s. Lending ideas from ultrasound imaging and merging the time-of-flight detection with optical interferometry to detect optical delays in the pico- and femtosecond range as known from the autocorrelator in the 1960&#x27;s, the technique&#x27;s development was and is tightly associated with the availability of novel electronic, mechanical and photonic abilities. Stemming from single lateral point low-coherence interferometry the addition of a wide range of technologies enabled key milestones in this computational imaging technique. High-speed axial and lateral scanners, ultra-broad spectrum or ultra-fast spectrally tunable lasers or other high brightness radiation sources, increasingly sensitive detectors, like high resolution and high speed cameras or fast A/D-converters that picked up from and drove ideas in the rapidly developing photonics field, together with the increasing availability of computing power were essential for its birth and success. In 1991, David Huang, then a student in James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Eric Swanson at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and colleagues at the Harvard Medical School, successfully demonstrated imaging and called the new imaging modality &quot;optical coherence tomography&quot;. Since then, OCT with micrometer axial resolution and below and cross-sectional imaging capabilities has become a prominent biomedical imaging technique that has continually improved in technical performance and range of applications. The improvement in image acquisition rate is particularly spectacular, starting with the original 0.8 Hz axial scan repetition rate to the current commercial clinical OCT systems operating at several hundred kHz and laboratory prototypes at multiple MHz. The range of applications has expanded from ophthalmology to cardiology and other medical specialties. For their roles in the invention of OCT, Fujimoto, Huang, and Swanson received the 2023 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. These developments have been reviewed in articles written for the general scientific and medical readership.

It is particularly suited to ophthalmic applications and other tissue imaging requiring micrometer resolution and millimeter penetration depth. OCT has also been used for various art conservation projects, where it is used to analyze different layers in a painting. OCT has interesting advantages over other medical imaging systems. Medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically a fraction of a millimeter), the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. sub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in ophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).

OCT is based on low-coherence interferometry. In conventional interferometry with long coherence length (i.e., laser interferometry), interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond lasers). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.

Light in an OCT system is broken into two arms – a sample arm (containing the item of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of reflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm gives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have traveled the &quot;same&quot; optical distance (&quot;same&quot; meaning a difference of less than a coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a reflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT). Areas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater interference than areas that don&#x27;t. Any light that is outside the short coherence length will not interfere. This reflectivity profile, called an A-scan, contains information about the spatial dimensions and location of structures within the item of interest. A cross-sectional tomogram (B-scan) may be achieved by laterally combining a series of these axial depth scans (A-scan). En face imaging at an acquired depth is possible depending on the imaging engine used.

==Layperson&#x27;s explanation==


Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technique for obtaining sub-surface images of translucent or opaque materials at a resolution equivalent to a low-power microscope. It is effectively &quot;optical ultrasound&quot;, imaging reflections from within tissue to provide cross-sectional images.

OCT has attracted interest among the medical community because it provides tissue morphology imagery at much higher resolution (less than 10 μm axially and less than 20 μm laterally ) than other imaging modalities such as MRI or ultrasound.

The key benefits of OCT are:
* Live sub-surface images at near-microscopic resolution
* Instant, direct imaging of tissue morphology
* No preparation of the sample or subject, no contact
* No ionizing radiation

OCT delivers high resolution because it is based on light, rather than sound or radio frequency. An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and the small portion of this light that reflects directly back from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons, allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.

Within the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to ultrasound imaging. Other medical imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.

The technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2 mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained &quot;non-contact&quot; or through a transparent window or membrane.

The laser output from the instruments used is loweye-safe near-infrared or visible-lightand no damage to the sample is therefore likely.

==Theory==
The principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The optical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically Michelson type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is split into and recombined from reference and sample arms, respectively.

===Time domain===

:formula_1
In time domain OCT the path length of the reference arm is varied in time (the reference mirror is translated longitudinally). A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called autocorrelation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as path length difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds to path length matching.

The interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in terms of the source intensity, formula_2, as

:formula_3

where formula_4 represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and formula_5 is called the complex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier dependent on reference arm scan or time delay formula_6, and whose recovery is of interest in OCT. Due to the coherence gating effect of OCT the complex degree of coherence is represented as a Gaussian function expressed as

:formula_7

where formula_8 represents the spectral width of the source in the optical frequency domain, and formula_9 is the centre optical frequency of the source. In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the Doppler effect resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical carrier has a frequency expressed as

:formula_10

where formula_9 is the central optical frequency of the source, formula_12 is the scanning velocity of the pathlength variation, and formula_13 is the speed of light.

The axial and lateral resolutions of OCT are decoupled from one another; the former being an equivalent to the coherence length of the light source and the latter being a function of the optics. The axial resolution of OCT is defined as

where formula_14 and formula_15 are respectively the central wavelength and the spectral width of the light source.

===Fourier domain===

Fourier-domain (or Frequency-domain) OCT (FD-OCT) has speed and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) advantages over time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) and has become the standard in the industry since 2006. The idea of using frequency modulation and coherent detection to obtain ranging information was already demonstrated in optical frequency domain reflectometry and laser radar in the 1980s, though the distance resolution and range were much longer than OCT. There are two types of FD-OCT – swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) – both of which acquire spectral interferograms which are then Fourier transformed to obtain an axial scan of reflectance amplitude versus depth. In SS-OCT, the spectral interferogram is acquired sequentially by tuning the wavelength of a laser light source. SD-OCT acquires spectral interferogram simultaneously in a spectrometer. An implementation of SS-OCT was described by the MIT group as early as 1994.   A group based in the University of Vienna described measurement of intraocular distance using both tunable laser and spectrometer-based interferometry as early as 1995. SD-OCT imaging was first demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo by a collaboration between the Vienna group and a group based in the Nicholas Copernicus University in a series of articles between 2000 and 2002. The SNR advantage of FD-OCT over TD-OCT was first demonstrated in eye imaging and further analyzed by multiple groups of researchers in 2003.

====Spectral-domain OCT====
Spectral-domain OCT (spatially encoded frequency domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal-to-noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300 nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.

The drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth-dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally, the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which cannot take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.

Synthetic array heterodyne detection offers another approach to this problem without the need for high dispersion.

====Swept-source OCT====
Swept-source OCT (Time-encoded frequency domain OCT) tries to combine some of the advantages of standard TD and spectral domain OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than spectral domain OCT, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference arm into the swept source OCT light source. Here the advantage lies in the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve very small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies (20–200 kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially at high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high frequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or the sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).

==Scanning schemes==
Focusing the light beam to a point on the surface of the sample under test, and recombining the reflected light with the reference will yield an interferogram with sample information corresponding to a single A-scan (Z axis only). Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light on the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan).

===Single point===
Systems based on single point, confocal, or flying-spot time domain OCT, must scan the sample in two lateral dimensions and reconstruct a three-dimensional image using depth information obtained by coherence-gating through an axially scanning reference arm (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional lateral scanning has been electromechanically implemented by moving the sample using a translation stage, and using a novel micro-electro-mechanical system scanner.

=== Line-field OCT ===
Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) is an imaging technique based on the principle of time-domain OCT with line illumination using a broadband laser and line detection using a line-scan camera. LC-OCT produces B-scans in real-time from multiple A-scans acquired in parallel. En face as well as three-dimensional images can also be obtained by scanning the illumination line laterally. The focus is continuously adjusted during the scan of the sample depth, using a high numerical aperture (NA) microscope objective to image with high lateral resolution. By using a supercontinuum laser as a light source, a quasi-isotropic spatial resolution of ~ 1 μm is achieved at a central wavelength of ~ 800 nm. On the other hand, line illumination and detection, combined with the use of a high NA microscope objective, produce a confocal gate that prevents most scattered light that does not contribute to the signal from being detected by the camera. This confocal gate, which is absent in the full-field OCT technique, gives LC-OCT an advantage in terms of detection sensitivity and penetration in highly scattering media such as skin tissues. So far this technique has been used mainly for skin imaging in the fields of dermatology and cosmetology.

=== Full-field OCT ===
An imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara&#x27;s team in 1998, with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning. In this technique called full-field OCT (FF-OCT), unlike other OCT techniques that acquire cross-sections of the sample, the images are here &quot;en-face&quot; i.e. like images of classical microscopy: orthogonal to the light beam of illumination.

More precisely, interferometric images are created by a Michelson interferometer where the path length difference is varied by a fast electric component (usually a piezo mirror in the reference arm). These images acquired by a CCD camera are combined in post-treatment (or online) by the phase shift interferometry method, where usually 2 or 4 images per modulation period are acquired, depending on the algorithm used. More recently, approaches that allow rapid single-shot imaging were developed to simultaneously capture multiple phase-shifted images required for reconstruction, using single camera. Single-shot time-domain OCM is limited only by the camera frame rate and available illumination.

The &quot;en-face&quot; tomographic images are thus produced by a wide-field illumination, ensured by the Linnik configuration of the Michelson interferometer where a microscope objective is used in both arms. Furthermore, while the temporal coherence of the source must remain low as in classical OCT (i.e. a broad spectrum), the spatial coherence must also be low to avoid parasitical interferences (i.e. a source with a large size).

==Selected applications==
Optical coherence tomography is an established medical imaging technique and is used across several medical specialties including ophthalmology and cardiology and is widely used in basic science research applications.

=== Ophthalmology ===
Ocular (or ophthalmic) OCT is used heavily by ophthalmologists and optometrists to obtain high-resolution images of the retina and anterior segment. Owing to OCT&#x27;s capability to show cross-sections of tissue layers with micrometer resolution, OCT provides a straightforward method of assessing cellular organization, photoreceptor integrity, and axonal thickness in glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and other eye diseases or systemic pathologies which have ocular signs. Additionally, ophthalmologists leverage OCT to assess the vascular health of the retina via a technique called OCT angiography (OCTA). In ophthalmological surgery, especially retinal surgery, an OCT can be mounted on the microscope. Such a system is called an &quot;intraoperative OCT&quot; (iOCT) and provides support during the surgery with clinical benefits. Polarization-sensitive OCT was recently applied in the human retina to determine optical polarization properties of vessel walls near the optic nerve.

Retinal imaging with PS-OCT demonstrated how the thickness and birefringence of blood vessel wall tissue of healthy subjects could be quantified, in vivo. PS-OCT was subsequently applied to patients with diabetes and age-matched healthy subjects, and showed an almost 100% increase in vessel wall birefringence due to diabetes, without a significant change in vessel wall thickness. In patients with hypertension however, the retinal vessel wall thickness increased by 60% while the vessel wall birefringence dropped by 20%, on average. The large differences measured in healthy subjects and patients suggest that retinal measurements with PS-OCT could be used as a screening tool for hypertension and diabetes.

OCT can used to measure the thickness of the Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

=== Cardiology ===

In the settings of cardiology, OCT is used to image coronary arteries to visualize vessel wall lumen morphology and microstructure at a resolution ~10 times higher than other existing modalities such as intravascular ultrasounds, and x-ray angiography (intracoronary optical coherence tomography). For this type of application, 1 mm in diameter or smaller fiber-optics catheters are used to access artery lumen through semi-invasive interventions such as percutaneous coronary interventions.

The first demonstration of endoscopic OCT was reported in 1997, by researchers in Fujimoto&#x27;s laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first TD-OCT imaging catheter and system was commercialized by LightLab Imaging, Inc., a company based in Massachusetts in 2006. The first FD-OCT imaging study was reported by Massachusetts General Hospital in 2008. Intracoronary FD-OCT was first introduced in the market in 2009 by LightLab Imaging, Inc. followed by Terumo Corporation in 2012 and by Gentuity LLC in 2020. The higher acquisition speed of FD-OCT enabled the widespread adoption of this imaging technology for coronary artery imaging. It is estimated that over 100,000 FD-OCT coronary imaging cases are performed yearly, and that the market is increasing by approximately 20% every year.

Other developments of intracoronary OCT included the combination with other optical imaging modalities for multi-modality imaging. Intravascular OCT has been combined with near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging (NIRF) to enhance its capability to detect molecular/functional and tissue morphological information simultaneously. In a similar way, combination with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been implemented.

=== Neurovascular ===

Endoscopic/intravascular OCT has been further developed for use in neurovascular applications including imaging for guiding endovascular treatment of ischemic stroke and brain aneurysms.

Initial clinical investigations with existing coronary OCT catheters have been limited to proximal intracranial anatomy of patient with limited tortuosity, as coronary OCT technology was not designed for the tortuous cerebrovasculature encountered in the brain. However, despite these limitations, it showed the potential of OCT for the imaging of neurovascular disease. An intravascular OCT imaging catheter design tailored for use in tortuous neurovascular anatomy has been proposed in 2020. A first-in-human study using endovascular neuro OCT (&quot;n&quot;OCT) has been reported in 2024.

=== Oncology ===
Endoscopic OCT has been applied to the detection and diagnosis of cancer and precancerous lesions, such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and esophageal dysplasia.

=== Dermatology ===
The first use of OCT in dermatology dates back to 1997. Since then, OCT has been applied to the diagnosis of various skin lesions including carcinomas. However, the diagnosis of melanoma using conventional OCT is difficult, especially due to insufficient imaging resolution. Emerging high-resolution OCT techniques such as LC-OCT have the potential to improve the clinical diagnostic process, allowing for the early detection of malignant skin tumors – including melanoma – and a reduction in the number of surgical excisions of benign lesions. Other promising areas of application include the imaging of lesions where excisions are hazardous or impossible and the guidance of surgical interventions through identification of tumor margins.

===Dentistry===

Researchers in Tokyo medical and Dental University were able to detect enamel white spot lesions around and beneath the orthodontic brackets using swept source OCT.

=== Research applications ===
Researchers have used OCT to produce detailed images of mice brains, through a &quot;window&quot; made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in the skull. Optical coherence tomography is also applicable and increasingly used in industrial applications, such as nondestructive testing (NDT), material thickness measurements, and in particular thin silicon wafers and compound semiconductor wafers thickness measurements surface roughness characterization, surface and cross-section imaging and volume loss measurements. OCT systems with feedback can be used to control manufacturing processes. With high speed data acquisition, and sub-micron resolution, OCT is adaptable to perform both inline and off-line. Due to the high volume of produced pills, an interesting field of application is in the pharmaceutical industry to control the coating of tablets. Fiber-based OCT systems are particularly adaptable to industrial environments. These can access and scan interiors of hard-to-reach spaces, and are able to operate in hostile environments—whether radioactive, cryogenic, or very hot. Novel optical biomedical diagnostic and imaging technologies are currently being developed to solve problems in biology and medicine. As of 2014, attempts have been made to use optical coherence tomography to identify root canals in teeth, specifically canal in the maxillary molar, however, there is no difference with the current methods of dental operatory microscope. Research conducted in 2015 was successful in utilizing a smartphone as an OCT platform, although much work remains to be done before such a platform would be commercially viable. Photonic integrated circuits may be a promising option to miniaturized OCT. Similarly to integrated circuits silicon-based fabrication techniques can be used to produce miniaturized photonic systems. First in vivo human retinal imaging has been reported recently. In 3D microfabrication, OCT enables non-destructive testing and real-time inspection during additive manufacturing. Its high-resolution imaging detects defects, characterizes material properties and ensures the integrity of internal geometries without damaging the part.

<text>Xavier Saint-Macary (June 7, 1948 – March 13, 1988) was a French actor, brother of Hubert Saint-Macary.

Saint-Macary played in &quot;La Nuit américaine&quot; (1973) directed by François Truffaut and &quot;Le Château perdu&quot; (1973). American audiences will remember him as the enthusiastic but bumbling Detective Fontenoy in the Disney movie &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; (1977).

Saint-Macary died of a sudden heart attack in 1988, a few months short of his 40th birthday.

<text>The Panama scandals (also known as the Panama Canal Scandal or Panama Affair) was a corruption affair that broke out in the French Third Republic in 1892, linked to a French company&#x27;s failed attempt at constructing a Panama Canal. Close to half a billion francs were lost and members of the French government had taken bribes to keep quiet about the Panama Canal Company&#x27;s financial troubles in what is regarded as the largest monetary corruption scandal of the 19th century.

== Bankruptcy ==

On 4 February 1889, the &quot;Tribunal Civil de la Seine&quot; ordered the winding up of the Panama Canal Company in Paris. Work on the isthmus was stopped in the meantime, while the court-appointed liquidator arranged to maintain the existing buildings, tools and machinery. Within a few years, however, high losses were incurred due to the damp, warm climate. The French government repeatedly delayed the liquidation, because the take-over offers by various American companies seemed insufficient. An intermediate company could not be started for lack of capital. The liquidator appointed a commission of inquiry, whose 1890 report recommended continuation of the sluice canal and renewal of the 1878 contract with Colombia. The renewal was agreed in 1890 in Bogotá, to run until 1904.

The dimensions of the bankruptcy were clear by 1892. Some 800,000 French people, including 15,000 single women, had lost their investments in the stocks, bonds and founder shares of the Panama Canal Company, to the considerable sum of approximately 1.8 billion gold Francs. From the nine stock issues, the Panama Canal Company received 1.2 billion gold Francs, 960 million of which were invested in Panama, a large amount having been pocketed by financiers and politicians.

== Scandal ==

In 1892/1893, a large number of ministers (including Clemenceau) were accused by French nationalists of taking bribes from Ferdinand de Lesseps in 1888 to permit the stock issue, leading to a corruption trial against Lesseps and his son Charles. Meanwhile, 510 members of parliament – including six ministers – were accused of receiving bribes from the Panama Canal Company to hide the company&#x27;s financial status from the public.
Lesseps, his son Charles, members of the management as well as the engineer Gustave Eiffel, were at first given long jail sentences, later annulled.

In the bribery trial, the former city development minister, Bethaut, received five years imprisonment, of which he served three years. Baron Reinach – the financial adviser of the Canal Company and agent for the various bribes – committed suicide. Other defendants fled to England. On 7 December 1894, Lesseps died.

Politicians accused of involvement included Léon Bourgeois and Alfred Joseph Naquet. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and Jean Jaurès was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an enquiry into the matter, completed in 1893. The investigations into the Panama affair were resumed in 1897, but the defendants were acquitted.

== Aftermath ==

Georges Clemenceau was defeated in the 1893 election because of his association with Cornelius Herz. Although three governments collapsed, this crisis differed from the Boulanger affair in that the Republic was never really at risk of being overthrown. However, it did raise doubts in the public eye and meant that politicians were no longer trusted. To monarchists it proved that the republic was corrupt.

Hannah Arendt argues that the affair had an immense importance in the development of French antisemitism, due to the involvement of two Jews of German origin, Baron Jacques Reinach and Cornelius Herz. Although they were not among the bribed Parliament members and not on the company&#x27;s board, according to Arendt they were in charge of distributing the bribe money, Reinach among the right wing of the bourgeois parties, Herz among the anti-clerical radicals. Reinach was a secret financial advisor to the government and handled its relations with the Panama Company. Herz was Reinach&#x27;s contact in the radical wing, but Herz&#x27;s double-dealing blackmail ultimately drove Reinach to suicide.

However, before his death Reinach gave a list of the suborned members of Parliament to the &quot;Libre Parole&quot;, Edouard Drumont&#x27;s antisemitic daily, in exchange for the paper covering up Reinach&#x27;s own role. Overnight, the story transformed &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; from an obscure sheet into one of the most influential papers in the country. The list of culprits was published morning by morning in small installments, so that hundreds of politicians had to live on tenterhooks for months. The scandal showed, in Arendt&#x27;s view, that the middlemen between the business sector and the state were almost exclusively Jews, thus helping to pave the road for the Dreyfus Affair.

In 1894, a second French company, the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama (New Panama Canal Company), was created to manage the assets, and potentially finish construction. The new company sought a buyer for the assets, with an asking price of US $109 million. The construction of the canal was taken over by the United States which bought out the lease, the shares and assets in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of November 1903, for US $40 million. Work resumed in 1904 and the canal opened 3 August 1914.

<doc id="628617" wikidata="Q634839" url="?curid=628617" title="Act of Abjuration">
<text>The Act of Abjuration (; ) is the declaration of independence by many of the provinces of the Netherlands from their allegiance to Philip II of Spain, during the Dutch Revolt.

Signed on 26 July 1581, in The Hague, the Act formally confirmed a decision made by the States General of the Netherlands in Antwerp four days earlier. It declared that all magistrates in the provinces making up the Union of Utrecht were freed from their oaths of allegiance to their lord, Philip, who was also King of Spain. The grounds given were that Philip had failed in his obligations to his subjects, by oppressing them and violating their ancient rights. Philip was therefore considered to have forfeited his thrones as ruler of each of the provinces which signed the Act.

The Act of Abjuration allowed the newly independent territories to govern themselves, although they first offered their thrones to alternative candidates. When this failed in 1587 by, among other things, the deduction of François Vranck the provinces became a republic in 1588.

During that period the largest parts of Flanders and Brabant and a small part of Gelre were recaptured by Spain. The partial recapture of these areas to Spain led to the creation of Staats-Vlaanderen, Staats-Brabant, Staats-Overmaas and Spaans Gelre.

==Background==

The Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands were united in a personal union by Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V with the incorporation of the duchy of Guelders in his Burgundian territories in 1544. It was constituted as a separate entity with his Pragmatic Sanction of 1549.

His son, King Philip II of Spain, inherited these provinces on Charles&#x27; abdication in 1555. But this actually meant that he assumed the feudal title of each individual province, as Duke of Brabant, Count of Holland etc. There never was a single, unified state of the Netherlands, though the provinces were all represented in the States General of the Netherlands, since the Great Charter or Privilege of Mary of Burgundy, of 10 February 1477.

In the Dutch Revolt, from 1568 several of these provinces rose in rebellion against Philip. Given the monarchical ethos of the time, the revolt had to be justified partly – as William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch Revolt, put it – as an attempt whereby &quot;the Republic’s ancient privileges and liberty should be restored&quot;; partly as directed against the royal councillors, not the king: thus the legal fiction was maintained of just having revolted against his viceroys, successively the Duke of Alba, Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens, John of Austria, and the Duke of Parma, while the stadtholders appointed by the provincial estates continued to claim they represented Philip. 

This pretence was already wearing thin, however, by the time of the Pacification of Ghent in 1576. When Don Juan attacked Antwerp and Namur in 1577, the States General – as the provincial estates did with the non-royalist stadtholders – appointed Archduke Matthias, Philip&#x27;s nephew, as viceroy, without Philip&#x27;s consent. Matthias was young and inexperienced, and brought no resources of his own to the battle with Philip. This became a serious problem after the Duke of Parma started to make serious inroads against the tenuous unity of the Pacification with his Union of Arras of a number of southern Provinces, which the rebellious northern provinces answered with their own Union of Utrecht, both in 1579. Each union formed its own Estates General. William the Silent therefore decided that the rebellious Netherlands should look for an overlord who could bring useful foreign allies. He hoped that Francis, Duke of Anjou, the younger brother and heir-presumptive of King Henry III of France, who did not wish to be someone else&#x27;s viceroy, was such a man. The rebel States General was persuaded to offer him the sovereignty of the Netherlands, which he accepted by the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours, while Matthias was bought off with a generous annuity. Holland and Zeeland however did not join in the offer, preferring to look to William himself for the transfer of sovereignty.

==Act of Abjuration==

Transferring the sovereignty of the Netherlands presented a significant problem: the magistrates of the cities and rural areas, and the provincial states themselves, had sworn allegiance to Philip. Oaths of allegiance were taken very seriously during this monarchical era. As long as the conflict with Philip could be glossed over, these magistrates could pretend to remain loyal to the king, but if a new sovereign was recognised, they had to make a choice. The rebellious States General decided on 14 June 1581 to officially declare the throne vacant, because of Philip&#x27;s behaviour. Hence the Dutch name for the Act of Abjuration: &quot;Plakkaat van Verlatinghe&quot;, which may be translated as &quot;Placard of Desertion&quot;. This referred not to desertion of Philip by his subjects, but rather, to a suggested desertion of the Dutch &quot;flock&quot; by their malevolent &quot;shepherd,&quot; Philip.

A committee of four members – Andries Hessels, &quot;greffier&quot; (secretary) of the States of Brabant; Jacques Tayaert, pensionary of the city of Ghent; Jacob Valcke, pensionary of the city of Ter Goes (now Goes); and Pieter van Dieven (also known as Petrus Divaeus), pensionary of the city of Mechelen – was charged with drafting what was to become the Act of Abjuration. The Act prohibited the use of the name and seal of Philip in all legal matters, and of his name or arms in minting coins. It gave authority to the Councils of the provinces to henceforth issue the commissions of magistrates. The Act relieved all magistrates of their previous oaths of allegiance to Philip, and prescribed a new oath of allegiance to the States of the province in which they served, according to a form prescribed by the States General. The actual draft seems to have been written by an &quot;audiencier&quot; of the States General, Jan van Asseliers.

The Act was remarkable for its extensive preamble, which took the form of an ideological justification, phrased as an indictment (a detailed list of grievances) of King Philip. This form, to which the American Declaration of Independence bears striking resemblance, has given rise to speculation that Thomas Jefferson, when he was writing the latter, was at least partly inspired by the Act of Abjuration.

The preamble was based on &quot;Vindiciae contra tyrannos&quot; by Philippe de Mornay, and other works of monarchomachs may have been sources of inspiration also. The rebels, in their appeal to public opinion, may have thought it more important to quote &quot;authoritative&quot; sources and refer to &quot;ancient rights&quot; they wished to defend. By deposing a ruler for having violated the social contract with his subjects, they were the first to apply these theoretical ideas. Historian Pieter Geyl described the Act of Abjuration as a &quot;rather splendid, albeit late, expression of the sturdy medieval tradition of liberty,&quot; and noted that while the principles expressed in the act were derived from Calvinism, the document lacked a purely religious argument.

In order of appearance, these provinces are mentioned in the declaration: the Duchies of Brabant and Guelders, the Counties of Flanders, Holland and Zeeland, and the Lordships of Frisia, Mechelen and Utrecht. The provinces of Overijssel (which included Drenthe) and Groningen also seceded but are not separately mentioned as they strictly speaking were not separate entities but parts of Utrecht and Guelders, respectively. Large parts of Flanders and Brabant were later occupied again by the Spanish king.

==Aftermath==
The Act of Abjuration did not solve the problem of authority in the Low Countries. Philip did not recognise the Act, nor the sovereignty of the Duke of Anjou, while he had already outlawed William of Orange and put a price on his head. Many magistrates refused to take the new oath and preferred to resign from their offices, thus changing the political makeup of many rebellious cities in the Netherlands, strengthening the radicals. At the same time, the States-General had their own claim for authority, as indeed did William as their representative in most provinces, while Anjou was left as a sort of empty figure-head. The latter was not satisfied with his limited powers and made an attempt to subjugate a number of cities, including Antwerp. His assault on the latter, known as the French Fury, led to a humiliating repulse and greatly discredited the Duke.

This caused the States General to start looking for a different sovereign. After a first attempt to interest Elizabeth I of England in assuming sovereignty did not succeed, William the Silent was asked to assume the &quot;vacant&quot; title of Count of Holland, but he was assassinated in 1584, before the arrangements could be finalised. After the Treaty of Nonsuch Elizabeth agreed to send aid to the Dutch rebels as their protector, though without assuming sovereignty. Under the provisions of the treaty, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester was appointed Governor-General of the Netherlands. However, like the &quot;reign&quot; of the Duke of Anjou, this proved to be a disappointment. After Leicester&#x27;s departure in 1587, and given what the British historian John Huxtable Elliott called “the slow decline of the monarchical idea, in the face of repeated failures”, the States General decided to assume sovereignty themselves, thereby making the seven United Provinces a republic.

<doc id="628621" wikidata="Q5184785" url="?curid=628621" title="Crew (comics)">
<text>Crew, the first regular Czech international comic magazine, started publication in 1997. It was meant to be published every two months, but it started having long breaks after the first year. Officially publication ended in 2003 with &quot;Crew 21&quot;.

==Name==
Not to be confused with the English word &quot;crew,&quot; the name of the magazine was a pun on the word blood (Czech: &quot;krev&quot;) as the magazine wished to portray &quot;bloody&quot; comics alongside others.

==History==
It ran for quite some time under the team of Štěpan Kopřiva, Jiří Pavlovský and Petr Litoš. But issues 17–21 were done by Vladimír Veverka. After the collapse of the original magazine, Litoš, Kopřiva and Pavlovský began to publish a new magazine — Crew2. Nineteen issues have been published to date (first issue published 2003, latest 2007). The Crew under Veverka was visibly less popular with the long-time fans, although it had its own following.

Crew was the only magazine to officially publish international comics after the 90&#x27;s comics wave within the Czech republic. It has been criticized for not publishing Czech comics, which was redeemed partly by local magazines, such as &quot;Pot&quot;.

Explaining the end of the original magazine: Crew 22 was meant to be an issue of the original Crew comics magazine, yet it never was published and Veverka sold the Logo back to the original team. Also, all the comics (except for Understanding Comics&#x27;s second part) were published in the new magazine.

The album consists of all of the B-sides from the singles the band released between 1987 and 1989 (except &quot;Ana Ng&quot;), with the addition of the relatively new songs &quot;The World&#x27;s Address (Joshua Fried Remix)&quot;—released beforehand only on &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot;—and &quot;Hello Radio&quot;, which was previously released on a promotional sampler.

All of the songs, with the exception of &quot;(She Was A) Hotel Detective (Single Mix)&quot;, are included on &quot;&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s early material.

&quot;Miscellaneous T&quot; is said to be named for the section in record stores where They Might Be Giants&#x27; albums were most often shelved in the band&#x27;s early years.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the compilation a &quot;neat if uneven appendix to the longplaying oeuvre.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; wrote that it &quot;reveals TMBG&#x27;s enormous depth of material.&quot;

==Song notes==
The tracks are grouped according to the singles they originally appeared with:
*1–3: &quot;Purple Toupee&quot; (unreleased)
*5–7: &quot;They&#x27;ll Need a Crane&quot;
*9–14: &quot;(She Was A) Hotel Detective&quot;
*15–18: &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot;

The 13th track, which has no name listed on the album&#x27;s track listing, is not actually a song, but a snippet of a recording inadvertently left on the TMBG Dial-A-Song answering machine, in which a confused listener named Gloria talks to an unknown third party about the mystery of &quot;There May Be Giants&quot; and &quot;There Must Be Giants&quot;, as she mistakenly refers to the band. It would later be referenced when Bryant Gumbel referred to them as &quot;They Must Be Giants&quot; when they performed &quot;Your Racist Friend&quot; on the Today Show to promote the release of &quot;Flood&quot;.

&quot;Lady Is a Tramp&quot; is a cover of a song from the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;.

<text>Xie Lingyun (; 385–433) and also known as the Duke of Kangle (康樂公) was one of the foremost Chinese poets towards the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties and continued in poetic fame through the beginning of the Six Dynasties, so Xie is also considered to be part of the Six Dynasties poetry era.

==Life==

Xie Lingyun was a descendant of two of the most important families of the later Eastern Jin times, the Xie and the Wang families. His paternal grandfather was the general Xie Xuan, a general who is best known for repelling the Former Qin army at the Battle of Fei River, thus preventing the Former Qin emperor Fu Jiān from destroying Jin, and thus allowing the continuation of the southern dynastic kingdoms. His maternal grandmother was Wang Mengjiang, the only daughter of calligrapher, writer and politician Wang Xizhi.

===Birth and youth===
Xie Lingyun was born in Yangxia County, Henan, but his father died early. Xie Lingyun was consequently brought up by a Buddhist monk, Du Ming, in what was then Qiantang but now Hangzhou, a cosmopolitan metropolis at the southern end of the Grand Canal, a market nexus for maritime trade and transport to and from the north, and an area widely famed for its scenery with surrounding hills and the spectacular West Lake.

Although, returning home from the monastery in 399, when he would have been in his mid-teens, Xie retained a lifelong Buddhist practice. Furthermore, the family estate itself was a scenic wonder. Located in Shining () (modern Shangyu township, Shaoxing prefecture, Zhejiang province—but administered and named differently then), the estate had been carefully chosen by his grandfather, the successful general, both for esthetics of beauty and its seclusion, who then planned and laid it out according to his wishes. The estate included a significant hill to the north, upon which was the family homestead, and there was a matching hill to the south, each hill replete with its craggy cliffs and cascading streams: and, in between the two hills stood a lake. The family home on the northern hill had been terraced and developed with well-planned and situated orchards, gardens, walking paths, and ornate pavilions, all done with a mind to preserve and increase the viewer&#x27;s pleasure: the southern hill during the youth of Xie Lingyun was left as somewhat of a wild preserve; but, between the two there was a whole range of fields and crops as well as wild plant and animal life.

Even the secluded family estate was not necessarily safe during these turbulent times; and, when a major rebellion broke out, the family abandoned their country living in favor of the relative safety of the capital city, Jiankang (modern Nanjing), for the four years of its course. The Xie family received official residence in a fancy mansion, where their entertainments were among the foremost for the luxury and display fashionable at that time: that the young duke (having inherited the title when his father died) was well off financially (having also inherited the three thousand household fiefdom which went with the ducal title) and was also skilled in the expected literary abilities; which, altogether, went towards placing him in the highlight of the capital&#x27;s social scene, and (with the family connections) also thus appearing to be at the very beginning of a very successful official career.

===Career===
Xie Lingyun served as an official in the Eastern Jin, during which time the rebellion was quashed by general Liu Yu; however, this would turn out to be just a step in general Liu&#x27;s career, later on he would overthrow the Eastern Jin dynasty and establish the Liu Song dynasty, as Emperor Wu. The Xie family backed an alternative general, and the factional intrigues went on for years, before and after the eventual triumph of the Liu as the Liu Song dynasty. Liu Yu gained more and more power, at the expense of the Xie and the other old families, but at first was content to have the services of Xie Lingyun, nominally as an official of Jin. However, in the year 420 Liu Yu declared the end of Jin and the beginning of his new dynasty, the Liu Song. At this point, as an official in the Liu Song government, Xie Lingyun received a demotion, to marquis, with only 500 households in fee. He then was demoted to a position in a remote area, and so effectively exiled, to Yongjia (永嘉, modern Wenzhou in Zhejiang). Yongjia was a coastal seaport surrounded by scenic hills, and the setting for Xie Lingyun&#x27;s Yongjia poetic period, when he wrote some of his finest poems. After a year in office here, however, Xie claiming health problems, resigned and returned home to the family estate in Shangyu.

===Retiring to South Hill===
After returning home to the family estate in Shining (Shangyu), where he spent considerable time attending to the previously undeveloped or cultivated South Hill, which may also be known as &quot;South Mountain&quot;. Here he went on long exploratory expeditions, accompanied by dozens of servants, who often had to hack a way through the more densely vegetated areas: Xie Lingyun is also famed for having invented and used a type of wooden boots with spikes which he could remove or adjust depending on whether he was on level ground or on an up or down slope. His poems from this period made it to the capital city where they were popularly read, and the poems from his Shining period remain among his long lasting accomplishments. Some of the descriptions of and names for the locations of poetic occasions on his estate can be seen to be directly influential on the forty poems of the &quot;Wangchuan ji&quot; (also known as the &quot;Wang&quot; or &quot;Wheel&quot; &quot;River Collection&quot;) written by Wang Wei and Pei Di, in regards to Wang Wei&#x27;s Tang Dynasty retirement estate at Lantian, south of the contemporary capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an in Shaanxi province).

===Back in office, exile, and death===
Meanwhile, the political changes went on unabated, and Xie once again became enmeshed in them. In 426, the new sovereign summoned him to court, where he spent two years with no real duty or power, but rather as a token to display loyalty: he then left for two years, but came back in 430 to defend himself against charges placed by his local prefect. In 431, he was relegated to what is now Fuzhou in Jiangxi, then the next year further exiled to Guangzhou: Xie Lingyun was then sentenced to death on a pretext, in 433, at which point he wrote his final poem, lamenting that his death was not to be on one of his beloved hilltops; and, then was executed.

==Poetry==
Xie Lingyun has been considered a nature or landscape poet focusing on the &quot;mountain and streams&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;field and garden&quot; landscape poetry. His poetry is allusive and complex, with possible Buddhist influence.

===Formal technique===

Xie was influenced by a tradition of &quot;fu&quot;-style poetry, or literature. The Fu tradition often included eloquent descriptions of the beauties of nature; indeed, Xie himself wrote his renowned &quot;&quot;Fu&quot; on returning to the Mountains&quot; in this style: however, Xie&#x27;s breakthrough was to distill the essence of this type of Fu and adapt and compress it into the &quot;shi&quot; more purely poetic form.

===Influence===
Hailed as the progenitor of the Chinese landscape poetry genre (&quot;shanshui&quot; poetry), the reputation of Xie Lingyun as a great poet remains secure, as it has for over a thousand years. The &quot;Wangchuan ji&quot; by Wang Wei and Pei Di which describes the landscape features of Wang&#x27;s estate near Chang&#x27;an particularly shows the influence of Xie Lingyun&#x27;s poetry describing the landscape features of his estate near West Lake.

<doc id="628627" wikidata="Q193909" url="?curid=628627" title="Seversk">
<text>Seversk () is a closed city in Tomsk Oblast, Russia, located northwest of Tomsk on the right bank of the Tom River. The population was 108,590 at the 2010 census and 109,106 at the 2002 census.

It was previously known as &quot;Pyaty Pochtovy&quot; (until 1949) and &quot;Tomsk-7&quot; (until 1992).

==Geography==
The city is located 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) northwest of Tomsk on the right bank of the Tom River.
===Climate===
Seversk has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summer. The annual average temperature is 0.6 °C (33°F). The average temperature in January is between -21 °C (-6°F) and -13 °C (9°F). The average temperature in July is 19.2 °C (67°F). The total annual rainfall is 530 millimeters (21&quot;).

==History==
Founded in 1949, it was known as Pyaty Pochtovy (, lit. &quot;the Fifth Postal&quot;) until 1954 and as Tomsk-7 () until 1992. City status was granted to it in 1956.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated as Seversk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Seversk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Seversk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Seversk is the site of the Siberian Chemical Combine, founded in 1954. It comprises several nuclear reactors and chemical plants for separation, enrichment, and reprocessing of uranium and plutonium. Following an agreement in March 2003 between Russia and the United States to shut down Russia&#x27;s three remaining plutonium-producing reactors, two of the three plutonium producing reactors (the two that are situated in Seversk, at the Sibirskaya Nuclear Power Plant) were shut down.

Nuclear warheads are produced and stored on the premises. One of the most serious nuclear accidents at SGCE occurred on April 6, 1993, when a tank containing a highly radioactive solution exploded (see § Tomsk-7 explosion).

==Government==
The current Chair of the City Duma and Mayor is Grigory Shamin, who has served since 2010. The current city manager is Anatoly Abramov, who has served since August 2007.

== Secret city ==
Seversk had been a secret city in the Soviet Union until President Boris Yeltsin decreed in 1992 that such cities could use their historical names. The town had not been marked on the official maps until then. As was the tradition with Soviet towns containing secret facilities, the designation &quot;Tomsk-7&quot; (like its predecessor &quot;Pyaty Pochtovy&quot;) is simply a postal code which implies that the place is located close to the city of Tomsk.

For many years, residents have been restricted from entering or leaving the city. Upon leaving Seversk, residents had to surrender their special entry passes at the checkpoint and it was forbidden to discuss where they worked or lived. In 1987, some restrictions were lifted due to the large number of residents who worked or studied in Tomsk.

The city still remains closed to non-residents. There are six checkpoints where visitors must show entry documents. Permission to visit the city may only be granted by the appropriate authorities by a request of the institution being visited, or by a request of a private party such as a close relative. Visitors can apply for entry passes at the main checkpoint; prior to May 2007, they needed to visit a special office in Tomsk.

==Tomsk-7 explosion==
There was a nuclear accident at the Tomsk-7 Reprocessing Complex on April 6, 1993, when a tank exploded due to formation of red oil, while nitric acid was being added to a plutonium-uranium mixture. The explosion had a force of approximately 100 kg of TNT and blew out a large section of the exterior wall of the high level radioactive processing room, releasing a cloud of radioactive gas. The cloud was dispersed northwards by the wind, with some of the radioactive material settling over the neighboring village of Georgiyevka.

&quot;TIME&quot; magazine has identified the Tomsk-7 explosion as one of the world&#x27;s 10 &quot;worst nuclear disasters&quot;. The International Atomic Energy Agency considers the event a Level 3 &quot;serious incident&quot;.

==Culture==
Seversk has nine municipal cultural and artistic institutions, as well as four establishments of additional education for children of artistic and aesthetic focus. There is also a nonprofit organization, Ostrovsky House of Culture, and a cinema called Mir.

==Education==
There is a major post-secondary school in the city, the Seversk State Technological Academy, a branch of Moscow Engineering Physics Institute.

==Notable people from Seversk==
* Anastasia Shishmakova (born 2000), Russian group rhythmic gymnast.
* Margarita Aliychuk (born 1990), Russian group rhythmic gymnast and Olympic champion
* Lyubov Yegorova (born 1966), cross-country skier and Olympic champion

<doc id="628633" wikidata="Q110629616" url="?curid=628633" title="Philippic">
<text>A philippic () is a fiery, damning speech, or tirade, delivered to condemn a particular political actor. The term is most famously associated with three noted orators of the ancient world: Demosthenes of ancient Athens, Cato the Elder and Cicero of ancient Rome. The term itself is derived from Demosthenes&#x27;s speeches in 351 BC denouncing the imperialist ambitions of Philip of Macedon, which later came to be known as &quot;The Philippics&quot;.

==Greece==
The original &quot;philippics&quot; were delivered by Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman and orator in Classical Greece, who delivered several attacks on Philip II of Macedon in the 4th century BC. Experts have questioned his intentions behind the philippics.

A First, Second, and Third Philippic have been ascribed to Demosthenes. A Fourth Philippic is also extant, but is of disputed authorship.

==Rome==
Cato the Elder is also associated with the concept of the Philippic. Just as Demosthenes had been warning of the militaristic intentions of Philip of Macedon, so Cato warned the Romans of the potential threat posed by the Carthaginians. Plutarch recorded a common ending to Cato&#x27;s speeches: &quot;Carthago delenda est&quot; or &#x27;Carthage must be destroyed&#x27;. 

Cicero consciously modeled his own condemnations of Mark Antony on Demosthenes&#x27;s speeches, and if the correspondence between Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Cicero is genuine [ad Brut. ii 3.4, ii 4.2], at least the fifth and seventh speeches were referred to as the &quot;Philippicae&quot; in Cicero&#x27;s time. They were also called the Antonian Orations by Latin author and grammarian Aulus Gellius.

After the death of Caesar, Cicero privately expressed his regret that the murderers of Caesar had not included Antony in their plot, and he bent his efforts to the discrediting of Antony. Cicero even promoted illegal action, such as legitimatizing the private army of Gaius Octavius, or Octavian. In all, Cicero delivered fourteen Philippics in less than two years. Cicero&#x27;s focus on Antony, however, contributed to his downfall as he failed to recognize the threat of Octavian to his republican ideal.

Cicero&#x27;s attacks on Antony were neither forgiven nor forgotten, with the result that Cicero was proscribed and killed in 43 BC. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the Roman Forum to discourage any who would oppose the new Triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus.

According to Roman historian Tacitus, the &quot;Philippicae&quot;, together with the &quot;Pro Milone&quot;, &quot;In Catilinam&quot;, and &quot;In Verrem&quot;, made Cicero famous, and much of his political career sprang from the effect of these works. Others would have it that the &quot;Pro Ligario&quot;, in which Cicero defends Ligarius before Caesar, was the vehicle of his renown.

<text>Évariste Desiré de Forges, vicomte de Parny (6 February 17535 December 1814) was a French Rococo poet.

== Biography ==

De Parny was born in Saint-Paul on the Isle of Bourbon (now Réunion); he came from an aristocratic family from the region of Berry, which had settled on the island in 1698. He left the island at the age of ten years to return to France with his two brothers, Jean-Baptiste and Chériseuil. He studied with the Oratoriens at their college in Rennes and decided to enter their religious order. He studied theology for six months at the collège Saint-Firmin in Paris, but decided finally instead on a military career, explaining that he was not religious enough to become a monk, and that he was attracted to Christianity mainly by the poetic imagery of the Bible. His brother Jean-Baptiste, an equerry of the Count of Artois, introduced him at the French Court at Versailles, where he met two other soldiers, who, like him, were from the French colonies, and would make their names in poetry; Antoine de Bertin, also from the Isle of Bourbon, and Nicolas-Germain Léonard, from Guadeloupe.

In 1773, he visited his father and family on the Isle of Bourbon. During his visit, he fell in love with Esther Lelièvre, but her father forbad them to marry. Missing Paris, he returned to France in 1775. Soon after he left, he learned that the Esther Lelièvre had married a doctor on the island. His unhappy romance inspired his first published poems, &quot;Les Poésies érotiques&quot;, which appeared in 1778, where Esther appeared under the name of Éléanore. The collection of poems brought great success and celebrity to its author.

On November 6, 1779, Parny was named a captain in the Queen&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons. In 1783, he returned to the Isle of Bourgon to settle the estate of his father, who had died, and also visited the Isle de France. In 1785, he left the Isle of Bourbon for Pondicherry in India, where he became an aide de camp to the Governor-General of the French colonies in India.

He was not at all happy in India, but he gathered a part of the material for his &quot;Chansons Madécasses&quot; (Eng: Songs of Madagascar), one of the first prose poems written in the French language. He soon moved back to France, where he left the army and moved to a house he owned in the valley of Feuillancourt, between Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Marly-le-Roi. The house was named La Caserne (Eng: The barracks), and with Bertin and Léonard, they formed a literary club called &quot;The Society of the Barracks&quot; which met regularly at the house.

When the French Revolution broke out, Parny, who did not receive any pension from the King and was not particularly interested in politics, played no part. He did, however, have to settle the debts left by his brother Jean-Baptiste, and, in 1795, these debts nearly ruined him. He was forced to take a position in the offices of the Ministry of the Interior for thirteen months, and then worked in the Administration of the Theater and the Arts. In 1804, the Count of Nantes found him another government position.

In 1802, Parny married Marie-Françoise Vally, and, the following year was received into the Académie française, where he occupied the 36th armchair. In 1813, Emperor Napoleon I granted him a pension of three thousand francs a year, but this was stopped under the Restoration of the monarchy in 1814. He died on December 5, 1814, in Paris.

== Literary reputation and influence ==

Parny became known for his &quot;Poésies érotiques&quot; (1778) a collection of love poems which brought a breath of fresh air to the formal academic poetry of the 18th century. He is also known for his &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot; (1787), which he called translations of songs of the island of Madagascar, which are considered the first prose poems in French. They were illustrated by artist J-E Laboureur (1920)[1] and some of them were set to music by Maurice Ravel (&quot;Chansons madécasses&quot;, 1925).

Parny&#x27;s early love poems and elegies are characterised by the combination of tenderness, fancy and wit. One famous piece, the &quot;Elegy on a Young Girl&quot;, is an example.

He also published &quot;Voyage de Bourgogne&quot; (1777), written in collaboration with his friend Antoine de Bertin (1752–1790); &quot;Épître aux insurgents de Boston&quot; (&quot;Eng: Letter to the insurgents in Boston&quot;) in 1777, and &quot;Opuscules poétiques&quot; (1779). In 1796 he published &quot;La Guerre des Dieux&quot; (Eng: &quot;The War of the Gods&quot;), a poem in the style of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Pucelle&quot;, directed against the Church. The book was banned by the French government in 1827, long after his death, but still appeared in many clandestine editions.

Parny devoted himself in his later years almost entirely to religious and political burlesque. In 1805 he produced an extraordinary allegorical poem attacking George III, his family and his subjects, under the eccentric title of &quot;Goddam! Goddam! par un French-dog.&quot;

The poems of De Parny were extremely popular in France and as far away as Russia in the beginning of the 19th century. &quot;I learned by heart the elegies of the Chevalier de Parny, and I still know them,&quot; wrote Chateaubriand in 1813. The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin wrote, &quot;Parny, he&#x27;s my master.&quot; The 20th-century Russian poet Anna Akhmatova recorded Pushkin&#x27;s admiration for Parny in a poem: &quot;There lay your three-cornered hat, and a dog-eared tome of Parny.&quot;

His &quot;Œuvres choisies&quot; (Eng:&quot;Selected Works&quot;) were published in 1827. There is a sketch of Parny in Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s &quot;Portraits contemporains&quot;.

<text>John-Marguerite-Émile Lemoinne (17 October 1815 – 14 December 1892) was a French journalist.

==Personal and public life==

===Early years===
Lemoinne was born of French parents in London. He was educated first at an English school and then in France. In 1840 he began writing for the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, on English and other foreign questions, and under the empire he held up to admiration the free institutions of England by contrast with imperial methods. After 1871 he supported Thiers, but his sympathies rather tended towards a liberalized monarchy, until the comte de Chambord&#x27;s policy made such a development an impossibility, and he then ranged himself with the moderate republicans.

===Career===
In 1875 Lemoinne was elected to the Académie française, and in 1880 he was nominated a life senator. Distinguished though he was for a real knowledge of England among the French journalists who wrote on foreign affairs, his tone towards English policy greatly changed in later days, and though he never shared the extreme French bitterness against England as regards Egypt, he maintained a critical attitude which served to stimulate French Anglophobia. He was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, and published several books, the best known of which is his &quot;Études critiques et biographiques&quot; (1862).

===Personal life===
Lemoinne died in Paris in 1892.

<text>They Got Lost is a rarities compilation album by the group They Might Be Giants, released in 2002 in the United States and 2005 in the United Kingdom. It was available through online order several years before it went into general release.

Five tracks were previously released on the 1999 eMusic compilation album &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;, while four others are culled from the &quot;Working Undercover for the Man&quot; EP. Several tracks were previously featured on the band&#x27;s Dial-A-Song service and its associated website, as well as the band&#x27;s TMBG Unlimited mp3 subscription service. Others were produced for various side projects, such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline in Primetime&quot; TV mini-series &quot;Brave New World&quot; (&quot;All Alone&quot;, a sea shanty-like song about a bacterium transported to the Moon by Surveyor 3); a special edition of &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; (&quot;Theme from McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;); and the radio show This American Life (&quot;I&#x27;m Sick (of This American Life)&quot;). The title song previously appeared on the live album &quot;Severe Tire Damage&quot; (with a more uptempo rock arrangement), and &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; as the same recording that appears on this compilation.

This collection marks the third official release of the brief &quot;Token Back to Brooklyn,&quot; first issued as a hidden track on the 1996 album &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; and reissued on &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;.

==Reception==

Allmusic called the compilation &quot;a collection of truly rare rarities, it shows once again that the group&#x27;s more obscure songs are quite often just as great as their best-known ones.&quot; They particularly praised the silliness of many of the tunes, and the interesting notes on their backgrounds.

<text>The Scroby Sands Wind Farm is a wind farm located on the Scroby Sands sandbank in the North Sea, off the coast of Great Yarmouth in eastern England, United Kingdom. It was commissioned in March 2004 by Powergen Renewables Offshore, a division of E.ON UK. It has a nameplate capacity of 60 megawatts and is able to produce power to supply 41,000 households. Between 2005 and 2010, its capacity factor was between 26 and 32%. Its levelised cost has been estimated at £105/MWh.

The farm consists of 30 wind turbines, located in water from deep. Each turbine has three blades that rotate around a centre-point some above the mean sea level. The hollow diameter steel masts that carry the turbines are piled as much as into the sea bed, to provide stability on a substrate of shifting sands. These shifting sands have piled up and decreased water depth, blocking access from service vessels. An amphibious vehicle is being built to drive on the sand to gain access to the turbines.

The wind turbines were designed and manufactured by a Danish firm, Vestas. Each turbine has a capacity of 2 megawatts. Turbines were installed by the Danish offshore wind farms services provider A2SEA.

In August 2023 one of the turbines caught fire.

==Tourism==

The wind farm has an information centre serving around 35,000 visitors per year, and has become a local attraction.
In June of 2018, Eon refurbished the property, with new exhibits and interactive displays, among other branding changes.

As of February 2023, the Visitor Centre has been Permanently Closed and vacated by Eon. It was believed to have closed in late 2019, and the reason is unknown.

<text>Auchindoun Castle is a 15th-century L-Plan tower castle located in Auchindoun near Dufftown in Moray, Scotland.
==History==

While there is evidence of prehistoric or Pictish earthworks in the grounds of the castle, the remains most visible today are of the castle constructed in the mid-15th century. This building is sometimes said to be the work of Robert Cochrane, a favourite of James III. It passed to the Clan Ogilvy in 1489 and from them to the Clan Gordon in 1535.

There are accounts, including by William Forbes Skene and Alexander Macbain, that state that William Mackintosh, 15th of Mackintosh had burned the Earl of Huntly&#x27;s Auchindoun Castle which is why Huntly had him executed in 1550. However, Alexander Mackintosh-Shaw states that this story is entirely fictitious. The castle was damaged by the Clan Mackintosh in 1592 in retaliation for Huntly&#x27;s killing of the &quot;Bonny Earl O&#x27;Moray&quot;, their ally. In March 1593 Patrick Gordon of Auchindoun was forfeited as a rebel, and Auchindoun Castle was given to Sir George Home, whose wife Elizabeth Gordon was Patrick Gordon&#x27;s stepdaughter.

After the battle of Glenlivet in October 1594, the wounded followers of the Earl of Huntly came to Auchindoun for safety. James VI ordered that Auchindoun, Slains Castle, Huntly Castle, and the Gordon castles of Abergeldy and Newton should be slighted or demolished.

Following the Restoration of Charles II, the castle was again awarded to the Marquis of Huntly.

In 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was used as a temporary headquarters (on 6–7 June 1689) by John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army. However, the castle was derelict by 1725. Stones taken from the castle were used in local farm buildings and nearby Balvenie Castle.

==Architecture==
While standing, the castle had a large central tower and high curtain wall. Supporting buildings including a stable, brewery and bakery stood inside the wall. A second round tower guarded the north-west corner of the compound. Cellars and possibly dungeons were dug directly into the bedrock beneath the tower. Today much of the curtain wall and some of the outbuildings remain, but the central tower itself is very dilapidated.

An extension is known to have been added in the 16th century by the Gordons before the Ogilvys reclaimed it in 1594. Stones taken from the castle have been used in local farm buildings and nearby Balvenie Castle.

The ruins of the castle are in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument, but were for many years in too dangerous a condition to be open to the public. On the completion of consolidation works, Auchindoun was reopened for public viewing in November 2007.

==&quot;The Burning of Auchindoun&quot; song==

The sacking of Auchindoun by the Clan Mackintosh inspired a traditional song, &quot;The Burning of Auchindoun&quot; (lyrics courtesy of the Digital Tradition Folk Music Database), Child Ballad 183, &quot;Willie MacIntosh&quot;:

&quot;As A cam in by Fiddichside, on a May mornin&quot;
&quot;A spied Willie MacIntosh an oor before the dawnin&quot;

&quot;Tarn again, tarn again, tarn again, A&#x27;se bid ye&quot;
&quot;If ye barn Auchindoun, Huntly he will heid ye&quot;

&quot;Heid me or hang me, that shall never fear me&quot;
&quot;A&#x27;ll burn Auchindoun tho&#x27; the life leave me&quot;

&quot;As A cam in bi Fiddichside on a May mornin&quot;
&quot;Auchindoun was in a bleeze, an oor before the dawnin&quot;

&quot;Crawing, crawing, for a&#x27; your crouse crawin&quot;&#x27;
&quot;Ye burnt yer crop an tint your wings an oor before the dawnin&quot;

<text>Abel Servien, marquis de Sablé et de Boisdauphin and Comte de La Roche des Aubiers (1 November 159317 February 1659) was a French diplomat who served Cardinal Mazarin and signed for the French the Treaty of Westphalia. He was an early member of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; in the service of the French state.

==Biography==
Abel Servien was born at the château of Biviers, near Grenoble, the son of Antoine Servien, procurator-general
of the estates of Dauphiné.

He succeeded his father in that office in 1616, and in the following year attended the assembly of notables at Rouen convoked by the young Louis XIII. In 1618 he was named councilor of state and in March 1624 was called to Paris, where he found favor with Cardinal Richelieu. He displayed administrative ability and great loyalty to the central government as intendant in Guienne in 1627, where his executive qualities came to the fore, and where it became clear that he had broken with his background in the &quot;parlements&quot; to become a trusted follower of Richelieu. In 1628 he negotiated the boundary delimitation with Spain. In 1629 he was with the army of the king and cardinal in the War of the Mantuan Succession, where he remained behind at Turin to work on the peace negotiations after the royal party had returned to France; thus by 1631, he came to know Mazarin, whom he was able to introduce to Richelieu. Servien was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Cherasco and of the treaties with the Duke of Savoy (1631–1632).

He was appointed president of the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Bordeaux in June 1630 but renounced the place when he was offered the post of secretary of state for war by Louis XIII. In 1634 he was the first elected member of the Académie française. Two years later he retired from public life in disgrace as the result of court intrigue.

After his resignation, Abel de Servien retired to Angers, where, along with becoming a renowned croissant connoisseur and culinary expert, in 1641 he married Augustine Le Roux, the widow of Jacques Hurault. She was the daughter of Louis Le Roux, Seigneur de la Roche-des-Aubiers. The couple had three children. But contrary to common belief, he didn&#x27;t live in his castle of Sablé since he acquired this property only in 1652.

Servien&#x27;s exile lasted until Cardinal de Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1642.
The same year, he was called back to Court by Mazarin, who entrusted him with the conduct, conjointly with the count Claude d&#x27;Avaux, of French diplomatic affairs in Germany. After five years negotiations, and a bitter quarrel with the comte d&#x27;Avaux, which ended in the latter&#x27;s recall, Servien signed the two treaties of 24 October 1648 which were part of the general Peace of Westphalia.

He received the title of minister of state on his return to France in April 1649, and remained loyal to Mazarin during the Fronde. With the cardinal exiled, Servien was minister of state, &quot;de facto&quot; governor of France with his nephew Hugues de Lionne and his rival Michel le Tellier. He was made Superintendent of Finances in 1653, conjointly with Nicolas Fouquet. He was an adviser to Mazarin in the negotiations which terminated in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659). He amassed a considerable fortune, and was unpopular, even in court circles. He died at the Château de Meudon, which he had purchased in 1654 and where he had launched ambitious works of rebuilding.

His nephew, Hugues de Lionne (1611–1671), marquis de Fresnes and seigneur de Berny, was a diplomat and minister of state under Louis XIV. Abel&#x27;s brother, Ennemond III de Servien, enjoyed a long career as French ambassador to the court of Savoy. His elder brother François was Bishop of Bayeux.

Servien left an important and voluminous correspondence.

<doc id="628669" wikidata="Q1999438" url="?curid=628669" title="Geo D. Whitcomb Company">
<text>The Geo D. Whitcomb Company was founded by George Dexter Whitcomb (1834–1914), of Chicago, Illinois, who started a modest machine shop in 1878, and began the manufacture of coal mining machinery, laying the foundation for the concern that became known as The Whitcomb Locomotive Company.

==Beginnings==

Early in life, George Dexter Whitcomb moved with his family from Brandon, VT, to Kent, OH. Here he joined the Pan-Handle Railroad as purchasing agent. He worked on tests of the newly-invented Westinghouse Air Brake and was one of the original stockholders and members of the board of directors of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, when it was organized.

In 1868, George and his wife Leadora had a son, William Card Whitcomb. In 1889, William Card graduated from the University of Southern California and joined his father&#x27;s business.

In about 1870, George moved to Chicago and became the manager of the Wilmington Coal Mining and Manufacturing Company&#x27;s mines at Braidwood, IL. He also managed the Wilmington Coal Association. He purchased the rights to the Harrison Mining Machine, a compressed air power pick that could be used by one person. He developed it into the &quot;Puncher Machine&quot; - the first successful undercutting machine in the US. He resigned his position with the coal company about 1878 to focus on mining machine business.

In 1886, he relocated to California where he built a home and founded the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora. In 1896, the George D. Whitcomb Company was incorporated in Illinois.

About 1900, William became vice president of the company. In April 1906, he developed the company&#x27;s first successful gasoline locomotive that was built for a large Central Illinois coal mine. In 1907, George resigned leaving William the president and majority stock owner.

==Rochelle factory==
The Geo D. Whitcomb Company&#x27;s largest knitting machinery customer was the Vassar Swiss Knitting Company of Rochelle, in northern Illinois. In 1907, the company moved to Rochelle, where they continued to build knitting machinery and gasoline powered locomotives for coal and metal mines. The demand for gasoline locomotive required larger production facilities. In 1912 the plant was moved to larger facilities in Rochelle. The company ended its knitting machinery production to concentrate on locomotive production.

George Dexter Whitcomb died in 1914, in Los Angeles, California. His son, William Card Whitcomb, assumed control of the company. William was responsible for sales, accounting and engineering.

During World War I the Whitcomb plant was devoted to government orders. Hundreds of armor-plated locomotives were built for overseas service on trench railways in France. These small 6-ton and 9-ton, narrow gauge locomotives proved highly efficient in trench warfare and they were used extensively in hauling needed supplies up to the front lines. The Whitcomb Company received the &quot;Certificate of Merit&quot; from the United States War Department.

Many new innovations in the locomotive field were being introduced during this period. The first explosion-proof electric mine locomotive was designed and built by Whitcomb, in 1914. After exhaustive tests the United States Bureau of Mines issued Whitcomb a &quot;Permissibility Plate.&quot; Whitcomb was the first builder of locomotives for underground work to receive such an endorsement. The first Whitcomb electric trolley locomotive was produced in 1921, and in 1929 Whitcomb engineers designed and built the largest gasoline-electric locomotive that had then been offered to American railroads. This development was closely followed by the diesel-electrics, which revolutionized and forever changed the American rail transportation system.

In September 1926 William Whitcomb now relaxed his personal oversight of the operation of his company. He hired Carl Heim from Chicago, to take over many of the company&#x27;s operations management, including in the positions of Vice President and Treasurer.

===Partin-Palmer automobile===
From 1914 to at least 1916 the Geo D. Whitcomb Company assembled Brass Era cars in Rochelle for an automobile company, named Partin-Palmer.

The Partin Mfg. Co. was a large automobile sales agency in Chicago, that in 1913 joined with the Palmer Motor Car Co. of Henry Palmer in Detroit, to manufacture cycle cars, with a model called Partin-Palmer. The company first moved to Chicago to take over the Staver-Chicago automobile factory. By 1914, Partin and Palmer were no longer with the company, and it moved to Rochelle where the Geo D. Whitcomb Company assembled them for a year.

In 1915 the company got into financial trouble in Chicago, and the car&#x27;s name was changed to Commonwealth (1917-1922). In the 1916 catalog of the Commonwealth Motors Company, it states that Partin-Palmer automobiles were being produced in Rochelle under the personal supervision of Mr. W. C. Whitcomb, Vice-President of the Commonwealth Motors Company. Production moved to Joliet, Illinois. In 1922, Leland Goodspeed designed a new car for the company, which became the Checker Cab.

A restored Partin-Palmer automobile is displayed at the Flagg Township Museum in Rochelle, Illinois.

==Baldwin Locomotive Works==

Beginning in 1927, the Baldwin Locomotive Works began representing the Geo. D. Whitcomb Co. in the sales division, using the global organization of Baldwin to assist Whitcomb in overseas sales. In 1928, Whitcomb and Heim conducted a recapitalization of the Whitcomb Company, and invited Baldwin to participate. Baldwin accepted and purchased about half of the offered stock, with William Whitcomb and Carl Heim remaining in control of the majority of the company stock. In March 1930 Baldwin placed three of its officers on the Whitcomb board of directors, including then Baldwin President George Houston. This gave Baldwin three out of the seven board members.

By late 1930, in the Great Depression, The Whitcomb Company was having cash flow problems. Baldwin offered an unsecured loan for $125,000, in the form of a 90-day promissory note issued in December 1930. The condition of the loan was that Baldwin would be given a fourth board member for the duration of the loan, giving Baldwin four out of the seven board members, and so majority control of the board. On March 5, 1931, the bank holding the largest cash reserve of the G. D. Whitcomb Company seized the account to apply towards another debt that the company owed the bank. This left the Geo D. Whitcomb Company unable to pay its debts.

With a majority of members on the board of directors, Baldwin was able to direct the board to file for voluntary bankruptcy. Although William Whitcomb voted against the action, the bankruptcy was filed in Federal Court in the Northern District of Illinois. This move ended the Whitcomb family ownership of one of the most innovative industrial companies of its time.

===Whitcomb Locomotive Company===
In April, Baldwin created a new corporation and called it the &quot;Whitcomb Locomotive Company,&quot; in the state of Delaware. On April 13, 1931, the Federal Court put the assets of the Geo D. Whitcomb Company up for sale. Those assets were then purchased by the newly formed Whitcomb Locomotive Company, a fully owned subsidiary of the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Both William Whitcomb and Carl Heim were removed as officers of the company. Heim was tried for embezzlement of approximately $75,000 of Geo D. Whitcomb Company funds, but was acquitted.

On November 15, 1932, it was announced that the Whitcomb Locomotive Company acquired the Milwaukee Locomotive Manufacturing Company. The Milwaukee Locomotive, started in 1907, had been operating as a department of the National Brake and Electric Company of Milwaukee, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Air Brake Company. As a result of the sale, Westinghouse became a stockholder in Whitcomb Locomotive.

In February 1934, William Whitcomb filed suit against Baldwin Locomotive Works in Chicago Circuit Court, to recover the lost value of his company stock. However, after several years of litigation the case was ultimately dismissed in May 1937.

===World War II===

During World War II the Whitcomb Locomotive Company built road switchers for military service in Europe and the Middle East. The United Kingdom ordered the first fifty two in 1941, from Baldwin Locomotive Works, who allocated the order to their Whitcomb Locomotive Company. They were center-cab Bo-Bo locomotives built as Whitcomb type 65-DE-14, and were followed by variants 65-DE-14A and 65-DE-14B in 1942 and 1943.

They served in the North African Campaign and on military trains in Palestine and Lebanon, and then in the Italian campaign. The order was received by Whitcomb for the new design in December 1941, and the first locomotives were delivered to Africa by June 1942, less than half the normal development time for a new design. By late 1944 the company was producing one 65 ton locomotive a day.

On December 31, 1943, the War Department conferred the Army-Navy Production Award (&quot;E&quot; award) to the Whitcomb Locomotive Company and the presentation ceremony was held in the Rochelle plant on January 26, 1944. By the end of the war two additional stars (each star representing six months) were added for continued production performance.

From this design Whitcomb developed the 65-DE-19A for the US Army Transportation Corps. They were built in 1943 and 1944 and served in many theaters of operations including Great Britain, France, Italy and Belgium.

Whitcomb 65 ton locomotives powered the first Allied trains into liberated Rome (July 4, 1944), Paris, the first supply and hospital trains into Belgium, the first train into Germany (April 9, 1945) as well as the first American powered military trains used during WW II (North Africa, early June 1942).

;Post-war
After the war many were sold to civilian railways and industrial railways in the U.S., while others were sold to Canada, Cuba, Mexico, and the Netherlands. However, the Dutch soon found theirs unsatisfactory and replaced both the diesel engines and the electric traction motors in the early 1950s.

==Post World War II==
Whitcomb continued to expand and progress after the war and the increased volume of business made it essential to expand storage and shipping facilities. A warehouse complete with the latest in material handling equipment was erected in 1947. A ten-ton overhead yard crane was installed to facilitate handling and storage of steel slabs and sheets. During 1948, a combination loading dock and locomotive test building was erected.

==End==
The last Whitcomb Locomotive Company locomotive manufactured at Rochelle was shipped on January 4, 1952 (construction number 61189). It was a 25-ton diesel-electric locomotive delivered to the Central Procurement Agency of the Transportation Corps. This locomotive was lettered and numbered USN No. 65-00330.

In February 1952 locomotive production was moved from Rochelle in Illinois to Baldwin’s factory in Eddystone, Pennsylvania. Industrial locomotives continued to be built under the Whitcomb name at Eddystone through the end of December 1952, when the name was dropped. All Whitcomb line locomotives built after then carried the B-L-H identification name.

Production of the Whitcomb Locomotive Company line, with the latter ones under B-L-H name, came to an end in March 1956 — after producing approximately 5,000 locomotives.

<text>The 1979 European Parliament election, was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom after the European Communities (EC) decided to directly elect representatives to the European Parliament. It was held on 7 June. Elections were also held in eight other EC states. European elections were incorporated into UK law by the European Assembly Elections Act 1978. Out of the 410 members of the European Parliament, 81 were elected from the UK. The electoral system was First past the post in England, Scotland and Wales (electing 78 MEPs in total) and Single Transferable Vote in Northern Ireland (electing 3 MEPs).

The result was a landslide victory for the Conservative Party, which won 60 of the 78 seats available in England, Wales and Scotland. Their decisive victory in the general election of the previous month and divisions within the Labour party on whether to stay in the EC probably helped the Conservatives to such a comprehensive victory. There was a very low turnout in the election compared with other states, the lowest in Europe. Voter apathy was an explanation, but it is likely the large number of elections in 1979 had a significant negative effect on turnout. There were referendums in Scotland and Wales on devolution in March and the general election in May, as well as local elections in England (not including London) and Wales.

<text>Science Fantasy, which also appeared under the titles Impulse and SF Impulse, was a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as a companion to Nova&#x27;s &quot;New Worlds&quot;. Walter Gillings was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts &amp; Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;; Bonfiglioli changed the title to &quot;Impulse&quot; in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to &quot;SF Impulse&quot; for the last few issues. &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; ceased publication the following year, when Roberts &amp; Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.

Gillings had an inventory of material that he had acquired while editing &quot;Fantasy&quot;, and he drew on this for &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, &quot;Science Fantasy Review&quot;, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel &quot;Nonstop&quot; appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during the latter half of the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann&#x27;s well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was always higher than that of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of &quot;Impulse&quot;, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.

==Publication history==
===Gillings and Carnell===

In early 1946, John Carnell launched a new science fiction magazine titled &quot;New Worlds&quot;, published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, that October, sold better, but Pendulum went out of business before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.

At the same time that the first issue of &quot;New Worlds&quot; appeared, a separate British magazine called &quot;Fantasy&quot; was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. &quot;Fantasy&quot; lasted for only three issues before closing in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of &quot;Fantasy&quot; by publishing a fanzine, titled &quot;Fantasy Review&quot;, beginning in March 1947.

In 1950, with &quot;New Worlds&quot; on a stable quarterly schedule, Nova Publications decided to launch a companion, &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. They chose Gillings as the editor, and his fanzine, which had been retitled &quot;Science Fantasy Review&quot; in 1949, was incorporated in the new magazine as a department. The first issue was dated Summer 1950, but printing disputes meant that the second issue was delayed until winter. Paper rationing delayed the third issue to Winter 1951, but before it appeared, Nova decided that it could no longer afford to have separate editors for &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, and Gillings was let go. According to Carnell, there were also &quot;fundamental differences of opinion&quot; that led to the decision to replace him.

After the Spring 1953 issue, Nova Publications decided to switch printers, in order to cut costs and bring the cover price down from 2/- (10 p) to 1/6 (7.5 p). The new printers, The Carlton Press, failed to keep to the agreed printing schedule, and produced poor quality work; there were also printers&#x27; strikes, and this disruption caused extended delays in the appearance of the seventh issue. While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell&#x27;s, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith covered the conference for &quot;Illustrated&quot;, a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of Maclaren &amp; Sons Ltd, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova Publications, with a commitment to produce &quot;New Worlds&quot; on a monthly basis and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; on a bimonthly schedule. Maclaren&#x27;s legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute with The Carlton Press, and the seventh issue of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; finally appeared with a cover date of March 1954.

In 1958, Nova decided to launch a British reprint of the American magazine &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot;, under the same title. The British &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot; lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. &quot;New Worlds&quot;, Nova&#x27;s flagship title, and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though a change from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and in preparation for the change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, &quot;New Writings in SF&quot;, for publisher Dennis Dobson. Readers&#x27; responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from Michael Moorcock, published in the April 1964 &quot;New Worlds&quot;, asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying US magazines.

===Roberts &amp; Vinter===
In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts &amp; Vinter, an established publisher, heard from the printer of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and &quot;New Worlds&quot; that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts &amp; Vinter&#x27;s books: &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and &quot;New Worlds&quot; both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to &quot;New Writings in SF&quot;, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. Roberts &amp; Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli&#x27;s control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.

Bonfiglioli often bought material from writers without an established reputation; he did not make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, but he also had a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants—first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.

Bonfiglioli disliked the title of the magazine, feeling that it &quot;promised the worst of both worlds&quot;; he proposed &quot;Caliban&quot; as the new title, but the publisher dissuaded him. He settled on &quot;Impulse&quot; instead, and the magazine appeared under the new title starting with the March 1966 issue. The paperback format was unchanged, but the volume numeration was restarted at volume 1 number 1, to &quot;sever all connections with &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;&quot;, in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. The name change proved to be disastrous; there was already a magazine called &quot;Impulse&quot;, and this caused distribution problems. In addition, treating &quot;Impulse&quot; as a new magazine meant a fresh distribution contract was needed. Bonfiglioli attempted to repair the damage by changing the name to &quot;SF Impulse&quot; starting in August 1966, but the result was a dramatic drop in circulation.

By late 1966 Bonfiglioli had made enough money from his antiques dealing to be able to retire to Jersey. J. G. Ballard was briefly involved with the magazine in an editorial role, but his aims for the magazine were too far from the publisher&#x27;s goals and he was quickly replaced by Harry Harrison. Harrison almost immediately had to leave England and handed over much of the day-to-day management of the magazine to Keith Roberts. Despite the setback from Bonfiglioli&#x27;s title change, the magazine was still profitable, but in July 1966 Roberts &amp; Vinter&#x27;s distributor, Thorpe &amp; Porter, went bankrupt while owing Roberts &amp; Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts &amp; Vinter to decide to focus on their more profitable magazines, and the February 1967 issue of &quot;SF Impulse&quot; was the last, though &quot;New Worlds&quot;, the sister magazine, survived via an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss&#x27;s efforts. The title was merged with &quot;New Worlds&quot; with effect from the March 1967 issue, but nothing of &quot;SF Impulse&quot;″s content was retained.

==Contents and reception==
===1950s===
In the first issue, Gillings declared that he was interested in science fantasy &quot;in all its forms: with its significant ideas, its surprising prophecies, its sheer fictions, its evolution as a fascinating literature&quot;. Stories in the first issue, drawn from Gillings&#x27; inventory of material acquired for &quot;Fantasy&quot;, included &quot;The Belt&quot;, by J.M. Walsh; &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot;, by Arthur C. Clarke; and &quot;Monster&quot;, by John Christopher, writing as Christopher Youd. Gillings also included several non-fiction features, such as his fanzine, &quot;Science Fantasy Review&quot;, incorporated into &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; as a department, and condensed to a few pages. In the first issue Gillings reviewed an article about science fiction by Jacob Bronowski which had appeared in the &quot;Continental Daily Mail&quot;. There were also three book review columns: two by Gillings, writing under pseudonyms, and one by John Aiken, the son of poet Conrad Aiken.

When Carnell took over, he planned to distinguish &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; from its sister magazine, &quot;New Worlds&quot;, by adding more fantasy, while printing nothing but sf in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, though it took some time for the two magazines to develop separate personalities. Carnell dropped the non-fiction features and instead published a series of guest editorials, starting with Gillings in the third issue and H.J. Campbell in the fourth issue. The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren gave Carnell access to the publishing facilities of a well-established company, and to established distribution channels, which freed him to focus on his editorial duties. Carnell tended to put longer stories in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; than in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; typically ran a long lead novelette with several short stories. Stories that would not have suited &quot;New Worlds&quot; began to appear, such as William F. Temple&#x27;s &quot;Eternity&quot; (February 1955), in which aliens mysteriously provide haloes to thousands of people, and Dal Stiven&#x27;s &quot;Free Will&quot;, which featured robot ghosts. Stories in the whimsical fantasy tradition that had been started by &quot;Unknown&quot; did not often appear in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;.

Many of the lead novelettes in the 1950s were provided by John Brunner and Ken Bulmer. Brunner&#x27;s first appearance was in September 1955 with &quot;The Talisman&quot;; over the next few years he wrote both science fiction and fantasy for &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, including &quot;A Time to Read&quot; (December 1956), an alternate-world fantasy, and &quot;Lungfish&quot; (December 1957), a generation starship story. Bulmer&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was in June 1955, with &quot;Psi No More&quot;; he contributed regularly thereafter. A short version of Brian Aldiss&#x27;s first novel, Nonstop, appeared in the February 1956 issue, and Aldiss subsequently contributed some experimental stories. From 1956 onwards the magazine contained substantially more fantasy than sf.

In Carnell&#x27;s opinion, the literary quality of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was &quot;far higher&quot; than that of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, but &quot;New Worlds&quot; was always the better-selling of the two magazines. Carnell&#x27;s determination to keep the quality high led him to delay publishing issue 20 for two months because of a &quot;lack of suitable material&quot;. His efforts were rewarded by frequent appearances of stories from &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; in the annual &quot;Year&#x27;s Greatest SF&quot; anthology series edited by Judith Merril. Carnell occasionally used reprints, often selecting stories in line with the magazine&#x27;s focus on offbeat fantasy, such as Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Space-Time for Springers&quot;, and Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;The Graveyard Reader&quot;. Towards the end of the 1950s Carnell began to reintroduce non-fiction, and starting in 1959 he printed a series of articles by Sam Moskowitz on key figures in the early history of science fiction, such as Edgar Allan Poe; these articles, which had first appeared in American magazines such as &quot;Satellite Science Fiction&quot;, were later collected as &quot;Explorers of the Infinite&quot;. The artwork was of variable quality, in the opinion of critic Brian Stableford; among the better covers Stableford cites the work of Brian Lewis, who supplied almost all &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;″s cover art from 1958 through 1961. Historian David Kyle commented on the &quot;remarkable&quot; cover by R.M. Bull for the third issue, which he regarded as &quot;strikingly reminiscent of the work of Margaret Brundage for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the thirties.&quot;

===1960s===
In the early 1960s, Thomas Burnett Swann became strongly associated with &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. He had published a couple of genre short stories before beginning to sell to Carnell with &quot;The Dryad-Tree&quot; in the August 1960 issue. Swann&#x27;s speciality was historical fantasy, and &quot;Where Is the Bird of Fire?&quot;, his retelling of the Romulus and Remus myth, which was serialised in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; in 1962, &quot;received more praise than any other [novelette] in recent years&quot;, according to Carnell. Swann was one of the three mainstays of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; in the early 1960s: the others were Michael Moorcock and J.G. Ballard. Ballard&#x27;s first story in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was &quot;Prima Belladona&quot;, which appeared in the December 1956 issue; his work over the next few years was ideally suited to &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and he became a regular contributor. He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard&#x27;s more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; and &quot;New Worlds&quot; reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of New Wave science fiction. Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné series, about a sword and sorcery anti-hero, began with &quot;The Dreaming City&quot; in the June 1961 &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, and Moorcock appeared frequently thereafter: he had either a story or an essay (and sometimes both) in all but four of the remaining issues edited by Carnell. Terry Pratchett&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Hades Business&quot;, appeared in the August 1963 issue. Ashley regards the early 1960s as one of the high points of the magazine; it was nominated for the Hugo Award for each of the last three years in which Carnell edited it, from 1962 to 1964, but it never won.

When Kyril Bonfiglioli took over in 1964, he complained in his first editorial that he had &quot;just read through a quarter of a million words of ms [manuscript] and half of it was so bad it made me blush&quot;. He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, &quot;written before I got the hang of things&quot;, but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, &quot;They can&#x27;t possibly be worse than the rubbish that&#x27;s being submitted&quot;. Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, &quot;Jael Cracken&quot; and &quot;John Runciman&quot;. Bonfiglioli&#x27;s third issue included Keith Roberts&#x27; first two stories: &quot;Escapism&quot;, a time travel tale, and &quot;Anita&quot;, the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as &quot;Alistair Bevan&quot;, and also provided the artwork for several covers. &quot;The Day of the Minotaur&quot;, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title &quot;The Blue Monkeys&quot;. Swann&#x27;s novel &quot;The Weirwoods&quot; was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers who began to appear under Bonfiglioli&#x27;s editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli&#x27;s focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; under Bonfiglioli&#x27;s editorship as &quot;a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own&quot;.

At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several well-known writers to appear in an &quot;all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of &#x27;sacrifice. The issue in question was the first one under the new title of &quot;Impulse&quot;, in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed &quot;The Signaller&quot;, the first story in his &quot;Pavane&quot; sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another &quot;Pavane&quot; story and a short story by John Brunner from his &quot;Traveller in Black&quot; series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley&#x27;s opinion, the twelve issues of &quot;Impulse&quot; contained &quot;some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines&quot;. Christopher Priest&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Run&quot;, appeared in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce&#x27;s second story, &quot;George&quot;, was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in &quot;Impulse&quot;, both well-received: Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Make Room! Make Room!&quot; (later made into the movie &quot;Soylent Green&quot;), and Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Schooner&quot;. Other stories listed by Ashley include Thomas Disch&#x27;s &quot;The Roaches&quot; and &quot;The Number You Have Just Reached&quot;, and Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;The Eyes of the Blind King&quot;. Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.

==Bibliographic details==
The editorial succession at &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was as follows:
* Walter Gillings: Summer 1950 – Winter 1950.
* John Carnell: Winter 1951–1952 – April 1964.
* Kyril Bonfiglioli: June–July 1964 – September 1966.
* Harry Harrison and Keith Roberts: October 1966 – February 1967.

The publisher was Nova Publications until April 1964, and Roberts &amp; Vinter Ltd thereafter.

&quot;Science Fantasy&quot; was digest-sized for its first two issues. The size increased to a large digest for the next four issues, but with issue seven it returned to a small digest again, and remained in that format until the June–July 1964 issue, which was issued in paperback format. The remaining issues, including all those under the &quot;Impulse&quot; title, were published as paperbacks. It initially was priced at 2/-; the price was cut to 1/6 for the third issue, but returned to 2/- with the seventh issue. With issue 11 (December 1954) the price returned to 2/-, and it rose to 2/6 with issue 46 and to 3/- with issue 61. When the format changed to paperback with issue 65 the price dropped again to 2/6, and remained there until the title change to Impulse. All the twelve &quot;Impulse&quot; issues were priced at 3/6. The page count began at 96, and rose to 128 with issue 7. Issues 36 through 63 were 112 pages, and the final digest-sized issue was 124 pages. The paperback issues were 128 pages under the &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; title, and 160 pages for the &quot;Impulse&quot; issues. Volume numbering began with two volumes of three issues, but the second volume began with volume 2, number 4 instead of restarting the issue number at 1 as would usually be done. From issue 7 the volume number was dropped completely.

The schedule was initially quite irregular, with the first two issues, in Summer and Winter 1950, followed almost a year later by a Winter 1951–52 issue. Spring and Autumn 1952 were followed by Spring 1953 and then another long delay to the seventh issue which was dated 1954, without a month or season given. The schedule became more regular thereafter, with May 1954 inaugurating a bimonthly schedule that lasted till November 1955, except that September 1954 was followed by a December issue, and June 1955 was followed by September. After February, May and August 1955, the December 1956 issue began a regular bimonthly sequence that was marred only by the appearance of a November 1959 issue between the August and December issues. After the switch to paperback, the sequence ran as follows: June–July 1964, July–August 1964, September–October 1964, December 1964 – January 1965, January–February 1965, and then monthly from March 1965 to the end.

There have been no anthologies drawn solely from the pages of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, but &quot;Weird Shadows From Beyond&quot;, edited by John Carnell, and published by Corgi Books in 1965, drew eight of its ten stories from the magazine.

In 2013, a 371-page volume written by John Boston and curated by Damien Broderick, titled &quot;Strange Highways: Reading&quot; Science Fantasy, &quot;1950–1967&quot; was published by Borgo/Wildside in the US. It discusses, sometimes in detail, every issue, story, writer, cover, and even advertisement of the magazine.

<text>:&quot;See Battle of Chlumec for the 1126 battle at Kulm&quot;


The Battle of Kulm was fought near the town Kulm () and the village Přestanov in northern Bohemia. It was fought on 29–30 August 1813, during the War of the Sixth Coalition. A French corps under General Dominique Vandamme attacked Alexander Osterman-Tolstoy&#x27;s Russian corps on 29 August. The next day, Friedrich von Kleist&#x27;s Prussian corps hit Vandamme in the rear while Russian and Austrian reinforcements attacked the French front and left. Vandamme was defeated with the loss of between 13,000 and 25,000 men and 82 guns.

== Background ==
Following the French victory at Dresden, Vandamme pursued the retreating allies. Napoleon sent Marshals Gouvion Saint Cyr and Auguste Marmont to support Vandamme&#x27;s corps. With Vandamme in advance, Saint Cyr&#x27;s and Marmont&#x27;s corps brought up the rear. Vandamme caught up with Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy&#x27;s forces near the town of Kulm, eight kilometres northwest of Aussig (Ústí nad Labem, now in the Czech Republic).

==Battle==

On 29 August, Vandamme, with 34,000 soldiers and 84 guns at his disposal, attacked Russian formations forming a rearguard for the retreating Coalition army, at 14,700 to 16,000 strong, under the command of Russian general Ostermann-Tolstoy. The situation was very dangerous for the allies; if Vandamme won the battle, the French would take the passes in the mountains, and the retreating Coalition army could be trapped by Napoleon. However, Ostermann-Tolstoy rallied all of his troops for a stiff defense; he was seriously wounded, losing his left hand, but was replaced by his right hand man, Aleksei Petrovich Yermolov. By the end of the day the Allies had 20,000 men. All of Vandamme&#x27;s attacks were repulsed, and his situation got worse on the next day. A Prussian army corps commanded by Friedrich von Kleist attacked Vandamme&#x27;s rearguard. Kleist then received help from a combined Russian and Austrian attack on his front, under the command of Generals Mikhail Bogdanovich Barclay de Tolly and von Colloredo-Mansfeld. In an attempt to repulse simultaneous attacks on his front and rear, Vandamme ordered his forces to form squares. The inexperienced French troops were unable to fend off the allies, and soon withdrew from the battlefield, with heavy losses, including Vandamme himself as a captured prisoner of war.

==Casualties==
The French lost between 13,000 and 25,000 of the pursuing force of 34,000, including Vandamme, and almost all of his artillery, 82 of his 84 guns, were captured. The allies lost approximately 11,000 soldiers killed or wounded.

In Vandamme&#x27;s corps there were two Polish regiments of Uhlans, part of cavalry divisions under the command of General Jean Corbineau. These regiments were used by Vandamme to defend against enemy cavalry charges. One regiment, commanded by Colonel Maximilian Fredro (brother of playwright Alexander Fredro), was attacked after withdrawing to a defile and surrendered. The other regiment of Uhlans, under the command of Count Tomasz Łubieński (generally known in English as Thomas Lubienski) successfully withdrew.

==Aftermath==
While Marshal MacDonald&#x27;s defeat at Katzbach coincided with Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Dresden, the Coalition success at Kulm eventually negated his victory, given that Napoleon&#x27;s troops never completely crushed the enemy. Thus, by winning this battle, Ostermann-Tolstoy and his troops succeeded in buying much needed time for the Coalition armies to regroup after the Battle of Dresden for the Battle of Wartenburg and subsequently for the Battle of Leipzig.

===Insults===
According to a French anecdote, after the battle Vandamme was brought to and accused by Emperor Alexander I of Russia of being a brigand and plunderer. He retorted, &quot;I am neither a plunderer nor a brigand, but in any case, my contemporaries and history will not reproach me for having murdered my own father.&quot; This statement apparently hinted at the widespread belief that Alexander I was implicated in the murder of his father, Emperor Paul I.

==The battlefield today==
The battlefield is mostly built over. There is a large monument topped with a lion next door to the Hotel Napoleon.

<text>Kornel Ujejski (; September 12, 1823 in Beremyany, Galicia, Austria - September 19, 1897 in Pavliv near Lviv, Galicia, Austria), also known as Cornelius Ujejski, was a Polish poet, patriot and political writer of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary.

He was named &quot;last of the greatest Polish poets of Romanticism&quot;.

Kornel was born in a village on Dniester between Buchach and Tlumach. Ujejski was involved in Poland&#x27;s struggle for independence after it had been partitioned and erased from the map of Europe by neighbouring countries (Russian Empire, Prussia and Austrian Empire). In 1846, at the instigation of the Austrian Government during the Kraków Uprising, the Galician peasants massacred several thousand of the nobility. Ujejski then gave utterance to the universal feeling of indignation in his powerful poem &quot;Choral&quot;, which has become one of the notable patriotic Polish songs of that period.

The political situation in partitioned Poland was reflected in his poems and political writing. His writing conveyed patriotic and historic message and was meant to support the Polish people in their fight for independence.

<doc id="628721" wikidata="Q373292" url="?curid=628721" title="Trans-European Transport Network">
<text>The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) is a planned network of roads, railways, airports and water infrastructure in the European Union. The TEN-T network is part of a wider system of Trans-European Networks (TENs), including a telecommunications network (eTEN) and a proposed energy network (TEN-E or Ten-Energy). The European Commission adopted the first action plans on trans-European networks in 1990.

TEN-T envisages coordinated improvements to primary roads, railways, inland waterways, airports, seaports, inland ports and traffic management systems, providing integrated and intermodal long-distance, high-speed routes. A decision to adopt TEN-T was made by the European Parliament and Council in July 1996. The EU works to promote the networks by a combination of leadership, coordination, issuance of guidelines and funding aspects of development.

These projects are technically and financially managed by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA), which superseded the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-T EA) on 31 December 2013. The tenth and newest project, the Rhine-Danube Corridor, was announced for the 2014–2020 financial period.

==History==
TEN-T guidelines were initially adopted on 23 July 1996, with Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. In May 2001, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a Decision No 1346/2001/EC, which amended the TEN-T Guidelines with respect to seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.

In April 2004, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Decision No 884/2004/EC (added to the list by Decision No 884/2004/EC), amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. The April 2004 revision was a more fundamental change to TEN-T policies, intended to accommodate EU enlargement and consequent changes in traffic flows.

The evolution of the TEN-T was facilitated by a proposal in 1994 which included a series of priority projects.

In December 2013, with the Regulations (EU) 1315/2013 (TEN-T Guidelines), and (EU) 1316/2013 (Connecting Europe Facility 1), the TEN-T network has been defined on three levels, the Comprehensive network and the Core network, and therein the 9 Core network corridors.

On 17 October 2013, nine Core network corridors (instead of the 30 TENT Priority projects) were announced. These were: 
#the Baltic–Adriatic Corridor (Poland–Czechia/Slovakia–Austria–Italy);
#the North Sea–Baltic Corridor (Finland–Estonia–Latvia–Lithuania–Poland–Germany–Netherlands/Belgium);
#the Mediterranean Corridor (Spain–France–Northern Italy–Slovenia–Croatia–Hungary);
#the Orient/East–Med Corridor (Germany–Czechia–Austria/Slovakia–Hungary–Romania–Bulgaria–Greece–Cyprus);
#the Scandinavian–Mediterranean Corridor (Finland–Sweden–Denmark–Germany–Austria–Italy);
#the Rhine–Alpine Corridor (Netherlands/Belgium–Germany–Switzerland–Italy);
#the Atlantic Corridor (formerly known as &quot;Lisboa–Strasbourg Corridor&quot;) (Portugal–Spain–France);
#the North Sea–Mediterranean Corridor (Ireland–UK–Netherlands–Belgium–Luxembourg–Marseille(France), 
#the Rhine–Danube Corridor (Germany–Austria–Slovakia–Hungary–Romania with branch Germany–Czechia–Slovakia);

In July 2021, with the Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 (Connecting Europe Facility 2), the 9 Core network corridors were extended, partially significantly (e.g. Atlantic, North-Sea Baltic, Scand-Med) while the North Sea-Med because of Brexit has changed to Ireland–Belgium-Netherlands and Ireland–France.

In December 2021, the European Commission&#x27;s proposal for a new Regulation on TEN-T guidelines (COM 2021/821) proposes inter alia for the future a dissolution of selected Core network corridors (Orient/East–Med, North Sea–Mediterranean), its integration in other corridors (Rhine–Danube, North Sea–Alpine) and the creation of new aligned corridors (Baltic–Black–Aegean Seas, Western Balkans).

; Connections to neighbours
The development of Ten-T in the Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) was given in 2017 to the Southeast Europe Transport Community.

In 2017, it was decided that the Trans-European Transport Networks would be extended further into Eastern Europe and would include Eastern Partnership member states. The furthest eastern expansion of the Trans-European Transport Network reached Armenia in February 2019.

As per the 2021 proposal, connections shall also lead to the UK, Switzerland, the South Mediterranean, Turkey, and the Western Balkans.

In July 2022, it was agreed to link four European Transport Corridors with Moldova and Ukraine and to drop Russia and Belarus from the TEN-T map. An August 2023 report recommended TEN-T be extended to Moldova and Ukraine with a standard gauge (1435mm) rail line, to assist in their integration with EU rail networks, some lines running alongside the 1520mm lines to avoid disruption during construction.

==Core Network Corridors==
This is the complete list of the &quot;TEN-T Core Network Corridors&quot;.

==Funding timeline==
Financial support for the implementation of TEN-T guidelines stems from the following rules:

* Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 of 18 September 1995 contains general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks.
* Regulation (EC) No 1655/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 1999 amends Regulation (EC) No 2236/95.
* Regulation (EC) No 807/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amends Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95.
* Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2007 supplies general rules for granting Community financial aid for trans-European transport and energy networks.

In general, TEN-T projects are mostly funded by national or state governments. Other funding sources include: European Community funds (ERDF, Cohesion Funds, TEN-T budget), loans from international financial institutions (e.g. the European Investment Bank), and private funding.

== List of transport networks ==
Each transportation mode has a network. The networks are:
*Trans-European road network
*Trans-European Rail network, which includes the Trans-European high-speed rail network as well as the Trans-European conventional rail network
*Trans-European Inland Waterway network and inland ports
*Trans-European Seaport network
*Motorways of the Sea (added by Decision No 884/2004/EC)
*Trans-European Airport network
*Trans-European Combined Transport network
*Trans-European Shipping Management and Information network
*Trans-European Air Traffic Management network, which includes the Single European Sky and SESAR concepts
*Trans-European Positioning and Navigation network, which includes the Galileo

==Previous priorities==
At its meeting in Essen in 1994, the European Council endorsed a list of 14 TEN-T ‘specific’ projects, drawn up by a group chaired by then Commission Vice-President Henning Christophersen. Following the 2003 recommendations from the Van Miert TEN-T high-level group, the Commission compiled a list of 30 priority projects to be launched before 2010.

The 30 axes and priority projects were:

As of 2019, several of them are finished, e.g. no 2, 5 and 11, other are ongoing e.g. no 12 and 17, and some are not started, e.g no 27.

==Related networks==
In addition to the various TENs, there are ten Pan-European corridors, which are paths between major urban centres and ports, mainly in Eastern Europe, that have been identified as requiring major investment.

The international E-road network is a naming system for major roads in Europe managed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. It numbers roads with a designation beginning with &quot;E&quot; (such as &quot;E1&quot;).

<text>Hassiba Boulmerka (, born 10 July 1968) is a former Algerian middle distance athlete. While under threat of death from fanatics, she won Algeria&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal.

==Career==
Born in Constantine in northeastern Algeria, Boulmerka started running seriously at the age of ten, specializing in the 800 and 1,500 metres. She was successful in national and regional races, although there wasn&#x27;t much competition. Her first major international tournament was the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where she was eliminated in the preliminary heat of both the 800 and 1,500 m.

Boulmerka&#x27;s performances slowly became better, and her big breakthrough came in 1991. The first major race she won was the 800 m at the &quot;Golden Gala&quot; race in Rome. A month later, she competed at the World Championships. On the last straight of the 1500 m final, she sprinted to victory, becoming the first African woman to win an athletics world title.

Her performance did not only give her positive attention. She was frequently criticized by Muslim groups in Algeria who thought she showed too much of her body when racing. Boulmerka received death threats and was forced to move to Europe to train. In spite of this, she was one of the favourites for the 1500 m gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. In the final, she fought off Lyudmila Rogachova and Qu Yunxia (world record holder until 2015) for the gold medal. It was Algeria&#x27;s first gold medal at the Olympic Games.

Boulmerka&#x27;s next two seasons were not as successful, although she won a bronze medal at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart. In 1995, she hadn&#x27;t won a single race going into the World Championships in Gothenburg, but this did not prevent her from winning her second world title. It was her only victory of that season, and her last major victory. She competed at the Centennial Olympics in Atlanta, but sprained her ankle in the semi-finals. After the 1997 season, in which she did not defend her world title, she retired from sport.

Boulmerka was later elected to the Athletes&#x27; Commission of the International Olympic Committee.

She formerly held the 1,500 metres African record with her time of 3:55.30 run on 8 August 1992 in Barcelona. She also held the one mile African record of 4:20.79, set in 1991 in Oslo, for 17 years until it was beaten by Gelete Burika of Ethiopia, who timed 4:18.23 in 2008.

==Post-athletics career==
Boulmerka has returned to Algeria and is now a businesswoman.

<text>Jean-Louis Laya (4 December 1761, Paris – 25 August 1833, Meudon) was a French playwright. He wrote his first comedy in collaboration with Gabriel-Marie Legouvé in 1785. The piece, however, though accepted by the Comédie française, was never represented. In 1789 he produced a plea for religious toleration in the form of a five-act tragedy in verse, &quot;Jean Calas&quot;. In his next work, the injustice of the disgrace cast on a family by the crime of one of its members formed the theme of &quot;Les Dangers de l&#x27;opinion&quot; (1790).

It is by his &quot;Ami des lois&quot; (1793) that Laya is best remembered. This energetic protest against mob rule, with its scarcely veiled characterizations of Robespierre as Nomophage and of Marat as Duricrne, was an act of the highest courage, for the play was produced at the Théâtre Français (temporarily Théâtre de la Nation) only nineteen days before the execution of Louis XVI.

Ten days after its first production the piece was prohibited by the Commune, but the public demanded its representation; the mayor of Paris was compelled to appeal to the National Convention, and the piece was played while some 30,000 Parisians guarded the hall. Laya went into hiding, and several persons convicted of having a copy of the play in their possession were guillotined.

At the end of the Terror Laya returned to Paris. In 1813 he replaced Delille in the Paris chair of literary history and French poetry; he was admitted to the Académie française in 1817. Laya produced in 1797 &quot;Les Deux Stuarts&quot;, and in 1799 &quot;Falkland&quot;, the title-role of which provided Talma with one of his finest opportunities. Laya&#x27;s works, which chiefly owe their interest to the circumstances attending their production, were collected in 1836–1837. His son, Léon, was also a playwright.

<text>RenewableUK, formerly known as the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA), is the trade association for wind power, wave power and tidal power industries in the United Kingdom. 

==History==
A number of universities active in wind energy in the 1970s met under umbrella of the ITDG Wind Panel (Intermediate Technology Development Group). The BWEA was formed from the ITDG Wind Panel along with other interested parties and representatives from industry, to promote wind power in the United Kingdom. The inaugural meeting of the BWEA took place on 17 November 1978 at the Rutherford Laboratory with Peter Musgrove of Reading University as chairman.

In 2004 the British Wind Energy Association expanded its remit to include wave and tidal energy, and to use the Association&#x27;s experience to guide these technologies along the same path to commercialisation. In December 2009, to reflect this expansion in the industries it represented, members resolved to adopt the new name of RenewableUK.

===RenewableUK Cymru===
The members of RenewableUK are represented in Wales by RenewableUK Cymru, the Cardiff-based branch of the organisation. The remit in Wales expanded in February 2014 to include all renewable energy technologies and energy storage.

== Criticisms ==

=== Advertising Standards Authority ruling ===
In 2008 the then BWEA was found by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to have overstated the carbon dioxide emissions displaced by wind generation. The BWEA and its members had claimed a value of 860 grams per kilowatt hour but the ASA found this was exaggerated by 100% and ordered the BWEA to reduce the figure to 430 grams.

<doc id="628753" wikidata="Q970794" url="?curid=628753" title="Cruise for a Corpse">
<text>Cruise for a Corpse (orig. &quot;Croisière pour un cadavre&quot;) is an adventure game from Delphine Software International, made for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.

== Plot ==
The game is designed as a murder investigation. The player assumed the role of Raoul Dusentier, a French police inspector invited to spend some time on Niklos Karaboudjan&#x27;s boat. Quickly after arriving, Karaboudjan is murdered, and the investigation begins.

The game uses many references to French and Belgian pop culture. Karaboudjan is the name of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; character Captain Haddock&#x27;s cargo ship in the comic &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;. Just like in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, crab cans are used to hide objects (in the comic they contain opium, whereas in the game they contain hand grenades).

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Cruise for a Corpse&quot; &quot;an admirable recipe for a classic adventure of murder most foul&quot;. The magazine liked the rotoscoped animation, but criticized the EGA graphics and &quot;atrocious&quot; code wheel-based copy protection, and concluded that while &quot;Dedicated whodunit aficionados&quot; would enjoy the game, &quot;the general adventure gaming audience&quot; would find it &quot;tedious&quot;.

<text>Saint-Marc Girardin (22 February 1801 – 1 April 1873) was a French politician and man of letters, whose real name was Marc Girardin.

==Biography==
Girardin was born in Paris. After a brilliant university career in the city, he began in 1828 to contribute to the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;, on the staff of which he remained for nearly half a century. After the July Revolution and the accession of Louis Philippe as &quot;King of the French&quot; (the liberal &quot;July Monarchy&quot;), he was appointed professor of history at the Sorbonne and &quot;master of requests&quot; in the Conseil d&#x27;État. Soon afterwards he exchanged his chair of history for one of poetry, continuing to contribute political articles to the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;, and sitting as deputy in the Chamber from 1835 to 1848.

In 1833, he was charged with a mission to study German methods of education, and issued a report advocating the necessity of newer methods and of technical instruction. In 1844 he was elected a member of the French Academy.

During the Revolution of February 1848 Girardin was for a moment a minister, but after the establishment of the Second French Republic, he was not re-elected deputy in the National Assembly.

After the Franco-Prussian War, he was returned to the Bordeaux assembly by his old &quot;département&quot; — Haute-Vienne. His Orléanist tendencies and his objections to the Third Republic were strong, and although he at first supported Adolphe Thiers, he afterwards became a leader of the opposition to the president. He died, however, in 1873 at Morsang-sur-Seine, before Thiers was actually driven from power. He was buried at Père Lachaise (Division 32).

==Works==
His chief work is his &quot;Cours de littérature dramatique&quot; (1843–1863), a series of lectures better described by its second title &quot;De l&#x27;usage des passions dans le drame&quot;. The author examined dramatic passions, discussing the mode in which they are treated in ancient and modern drama, poetry and romance. The book, a defence of the ancients against the moderns, &quot;did not&quot;, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, &quot;take into account the fact that only the best of ancient literature has come down to us.&quot; Girardin&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; was, overall, very hostile toward Romanticism.

Girardin&#x27;s other works included &quot;Essais de littérature&quot; (2 vols., 1844), made up chiefly of contributions to the &quot;Débats&quot;, his &quot;Notices sur l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1834), and many volumes of collected &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, &quot;Réflexions&quot;, etc., on foreign countries and passing events (including his notes on the period of Russian administration in the Danubian Principalities). His last major works were &quot;La Fontaine et les Fabulistes&quot; (1867) and an &quot;Étude sur J.-J. Rousseau&quot; (1870) which had appeared in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;.

Weird fiction either eschews or radically reinterprets traditional antagonists of supernatural horror fiction, such as ghosts, vampires, and werewolves. Writers on the subject of weird fiction, such as China Miéville, sometimes use &quot;the tentacle&quot; to represent this type of writing. The tentacle is a limb-type absent from most of the monsters of European gothic fiction, but often attached to the monstrous creatures created by weird fiction writers, such as William Hope Hodgson, M. R. James, Clark Ashton Smith, and H. P. Lovecraft.

Weird fiction often attempts to inspire awe as well as fear in response to its fictional creations, causing commentators like Miéville to paraphrase Goethe in saying that weird fiction evokes a sense of the numinous. Although &quot;weird fiction&quot; has been chiefly used as a historical description for works through the 1930s, it experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, under the label of New Weird, which continues into the 21st century.

==Definitions==
John Clute defines weird fiction as a term &quot;used loosely to describe fantasy, supernatural fiction and horror tales embodying transgressive material&quot;. China Miéville defines it as &quot;usually, roughly, conceived of as a rather breathless and generically slippery macabre fiction, a dark fantastic (&#x27;horror&#x27; plus &#x27;fantasy&#x27;) often featuring nontraditional alien monsters (thus plus &#x27;science fiction&#x27;)&quot;. Discussing the &quot;Old Weird Fiction&quot; published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock says, &quot;Old Weird fiction utilises elements of horror, science fiction and fantasy to showcase the impotence and insignificance of human beings within a much larger universe populated by often malign powers and forces that greatly exceed the human capacities to understand or control them.&quot; 

Jeff and Ann VanderMeer describe weird fiction not as a genre of fiction, but rather as a mode of literature (i.e. a style or mood) usually appearing within the horror fiction genre.

==History==

Although the term &quot;weird fiction&quot; did not appear until the 20th century, Edgar Allan Poe is often regarded as the pioneering author of weird fiction. Poe was identified by Lovecraft as the first author of a distinct type of supernatural fiction different from traditional Gothic literature, and later commentators on the term have also suggested Poe was the first &quot;weird fiction&quot; writer. Sheridan Le Fanu is also seen as an early writer working in the sub-genre.

Literary critics in the nineteenth century would sometimes use the term &quot;weird&quot; to describe supernatural fiction. For instance, the &quot;Scottish Review&quot; in an 1859 article praised Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Walter Scott by saying the three writers had the &quot;power of weird imagination&quot;. The Irish magazine &quot;The Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, in an 1898 review of &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker, described the novel as &quot;wild and weird&quot; and not Gothic. Weinstock has suggested there was a period of &quot;Old Weird Fiction&quot; that lasted from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. S. T. Joshi and Miéville have both argued that there was a period of &quot;Haute Weird&quot; between 1880 and 1940, when authors important to Weird Fiction, such as Arthur Machen and Clark Ashton Smith were publishing their work.

In the late nineteenth century, a number of British writers associated with the Decadent movement wrote what was later described as weird fiction. These writers included Machen, M. P. Shiel, Count Eric Stenbock, and R. Murray Gilchrist. Other pioneering British weird fiction writers included Algernon Blackwood, William Hope Hodgson, Lord Dunsany, Arthur Machen, and M. R. James.

The American pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published many such stories in the United States from March 1923 to September 1954. The magazine&#x27;s editor Farnsworth Wright often used the term &quot;weird fiction&quot; to describe the type of material that the magazine published. The writers who wrote for the magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; are thus closely identified with the weird fiction subgenre, especially H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber and Robert Bloch. Other pulp magazines that published weird fiction included &quot;Strange Tales&quot; (edited by Harry Bates), and &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; (edited by John W. Campbell).

H. P. Lovecraft popularised the term &quot;weird fiction&quot; in his essays. In &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;, Lovecraft gives his definition of weird fiction:

The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain—a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space.

S. T. Joshi describes several subdivisions of the weird tale: supernatural horror (or fantastique), the ghost story, quasi science fiction, fantasy, and ambiguous horror fiction and argues that &quot;the weird tale&quot; is primarily the result of the philosophical and aesthetic predispositions of the authors associated with this type of fiction.

Although Lovecraft was one of the few early 20th-century writers to describe his work as &quot;weird fiction&quot;, the term has enjoyed a contemporary revival in New Weird fiction. Many horror writers have also situated themselves within the weird tradition, including Clive Barker, who describes his fiction as fantastique, and Ramsey Campbell, whose early work was influenced by Lovecraft.

<text>Bognie Castle (also called Conzie Castle) is a ruined castle on Bognie Estate, between Huntly and Banff in the Aberdeenshire region of Scotland. Once rising four storeys high, it is thought to have been constructed in the 1660s by the Morisons of Bognie.

== History ==

Bognie Castle was most likely built in the 1660s by the Morisons of Bognie when they lived at Bognie House. However, there is no evidence of the Morisons ever inhabiting it. This is most likely due to their subsequent acquisition of Frendraught through marriage around 1676. The 1688 date-stone at Frendraught suggests that they elected to complete the (re)construction of Frendraught that had begun under Sir James Crichton (following the Fire of Frendraught in 1630).

There is some confusion about the name of this building. Local enquiries cannot confirm if it had ever been known by any name other than &#x27;Conzie&#x27;, the only information being that it was originally situated on land belonging to the farm of Conzie, but which has long belonged to Bognie Estate. Castle Conzie may have stood a little to the west of Bognie House, but no trace of it remains.

<text>The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced in response to clean air legislation, the light-coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin&#x27;s natural selection in action, and it remains a classic example in the teaching of evolution. In 1978, Sewall Wright described it as &quot;the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.&quot;

The dark-coloured or &quot;melanic&quot; form of the peppered moth (var. &quot;carbonaria&quot;) was rare, though a specimen had been collected by 1811. After field collection in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, the frequency of the variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered the original light-coloured type (var. &quot;typica&quot;), with a record of 98% in 1895. The evolutionary importance of the moth was only speculated upon during Darwin&#x27;s lifetime. It was 14 years after Darwin&#x27;s death, in 1896, that J. W. Tutt presented it as a case of natural selection. Because of this, the idea spread widely, and more people came to believe in Darwin&#x27;s theory.

Bernard Kettlewell was the first to investigate the evolutionary mechanism behind peppered moth adaptation, between 1953 and 1956. He found that a light-coloured body was an effective camouflage in a clean environment, such as in rural Dorset, while the dark colour was beneficial in a polluted environment like industrial Birmingham. This selective survival was due to birds, which easily caught dark moths on clean trees and white moths on trees darkened with soot. The story, supported by Kettlewell&#x27;s experiment, became the canonical example of Darwinian evolution and evidence for natural selection used in standard textbooks.

However, failure to replicate the experiment and Theodore David Sargent&#x27;s criticism of Kettlewell&#x27;s methods in the late 1960s led to general skepticism. When Judith Hooper&#x27;s &quot;Of Moths and Men&quot; was published in 2002, Kettlewell&#x27;s story was more sternly attacked, and accused of fraud. The criticism became a major argument for creationists. Michael Majerus was the principal defender. His seven-year experiment beginning in 2001, the most elaborate of its kind in population biology, the results of which were published posthumously in 2012, vindicated Kettlewell&#x27;s work in great detail. This restored peppered moth evolution as &quot;the most direct evidence&quot;, and &quot;one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action&quot;.

== Origin and evolution ==

Before the Industrial Revolution, the black form of the peppered moth was rare. The first black specimen (of unknown origin) was collected before 1811, and kept in the University of Oxford. The first live specimen was caught by R. S. Edleston in Manchester, England in 1848, but he reported this only 16 years later in 1864, in &quot;The Entomologist&quot;. Edleston notes that by 1864 it was the more common type of moth in his garden in Manchester. The light-bodied moths were able to blend in with the light-coloured lichens and tree bark, and the less common black moths were more likely to be eaten by birds. As a result of the common light-coloured lichens and English trees, therefore, the light-coloured moths were much more effective at hiding from predators, and the frequency of the dark allele was very low, at about 0.01%.

During the early decades of the Industrial Revolution in England, the countryside between London and Manchester became blanketed with soot from the new coal-burning factories. Many of the light-bodied lichens died from sulphur dioxide emissions, and the trees became darkened. This led to an increase in bird predation for light-coloured moths, as they no longer blended in as well in their polluted ecosystem: indeed, their bodies now dramatically contrasted with the colour of the bark. Dark-coloured moths, on the other hand, were camouflaged very well by the blackened trees. The population of dark-coloured moth rapidly increased. By the mid-19th century, the number of dark-coloured moths had risen noticeably, and by 1895, the percentage of dark-coloured moths in Manchester was reported at 98%, a dramatic change (of almost 100%) from the original frequency. This effect of industrialization in body colour led to the coining of the term &quot;industrial melanism&quot;.

The implication that industrial melanism could be evidence supporting Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection was noticed during his lifetime. Albert Brydges Farn (1841–1921), a British entomologist, wrote to Darwin on 18 November 1878 to discuss his observation of colour variations in the Annulet moth (then &quot;Gnophos obscurata&quot;, now &quot;Charissa obscurata&quot;). He noted the existence of dark moths in peat in the New Forest, brown moths on clay and red soil in Herefordshire, and white moths on chalk cliffs in Lewes, and suggested that this variation was an example of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. He told Darwin that he had found dark moths on a chalk slope where the foliage had been blackened by smoke from lime kilns, and he had also heard that white moths had become less common at Lewes after lime kilns had been in operation for a few years. Darwin does not seem to have responded to this information, possibly because he thought natural selection would be a much slower process. A scientific explanation of moth coloration was only published in 1896, 14 years after Darwin&#x27;s death, when J. W. Tutt explicitly linked peppered moth melanism to natural selection.

=== Rise and fall of phenotype frequency ===

Melanism has been observed in both European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the rise in frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, as it has been measured by lepidopterists using moth traps.

Steward compiled data for the first recordings of the peppered moth by locality, and deduced that the &quot;carbonaria&quot; morph was the result of a single mutation that subsequently spread. By 1895, it had reached a reported frequency of 98% in Manchester.

From around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of &quot;carbonaria&quot; has steadily fallen in line with cleaner air around industrial cities. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, through more rigorous scientific studies. Notably, Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996, and L.M. Cook in 2003.

Similar results were found in North America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. It is believed that this is because peppered moths in Japan do not inhabit industrialised regions.

== Genetics ==

Tutt was the first to propose the &quot;differential bird predation hypothesis&quot; in 1896, as a mechanism of natural selection. The melanic morphs were better camouflaged against the bark of trees without foliose lichen, whereas the &quot;typica&quot; morphs were better camouflaged against trees with lichens. As a result, birds would find and eat those morphs that were not camouflaged with increased frequency.

In 1924, J.B.S. Haldane calculated, using a simple general selection model, the selective advantage necessary for the recorded natural evolution of peppered moths, based on the assumption that in 1848 the frequency of dark-coloured moths was 2%, and by 1895 it was 95%. The dark-coloured, or melanic, form would have had to be 50% more fit than the typical, light-coloured form. Even taking into consideration possible errors in the model, this reasonably excluded the stochastic process of genetic drift, because the changes were too fast. Haldane&#x27;s statistical analysis of selection for the melanic variant in peppered moths became a well known part of his effort to demonstrate that mathematical models that combined natural selection with Mendelian genetics could explain evolution – an effort that played a key role in the foundation of the discipline of population genetics, and the beginnings of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory with genetics.

The peppered moth &quot;Biston betularia&quot; is also a model of parallel evolution in the incidence of melanism in the British form (&quot;f. carbonaria&quot;) and the American form (&quot;f. swettaria&quot;) as they are indistinguishable in appearance. Genetic analysis indicates that both phenotypes are inherited as autosomal dominants. Cross hybridizations indicate that the phenotypes are produced by alleles at a single locus.

The gene for &quot;carbonaria&quot; in &quot;B. betularia&quot; was thought to be in a region of chromosome 17. It was later concluded that the gene could not be in that region, because none of the genes in the chromosome coded for either wing pattern or melanisation. The region that was used to find it was the first intron of the orthologue of the &quot;cortex&quot; gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Through elimination of candidates within the region based on rarity, a 21,925 base pair insert remained. The insert, labelled &quot;carb&quot;-TE, is a class II transposable element that has an approximately 9-kb non-repetitive sequence tandemly repeated two and one third times. There are 6 base pairs of inverted repeats and duplicated 4 base pairs at the target site not present in &quot;typica&quot; moths. &quot;Carb-&quot;TE has higher expression during the stage of rapid wing disc morphogenesis. The mechanism of how the gene increases expression, and whether it is the only gene involved, is still not known.

==Alternative hypotheses==

Several alternative hypotheses to natural selection as the driving force of evolution were proposed during the 1920s and 1930s. Random mutation, migration, and genetic drift were also seen as major forces of evolution. 

P. A. Riley proposed an additional selective factor, where heavy metal chelation by melanin would supposedly protect peppered moths against the toxic effects of heavy metals associated with industrialisation. This selective advantage would supplement the major selective mechanism of differential bird predation.

=== Phenotypic induction ===

In 1920, John William Heslop-Harrison rejected Tutt&#x27;s differential bird predation hypothesis, on the basis that he did not believe that birds ate moths. Instead he proposed that pollutants could cause changes to the soma and germ plasm of the organism. In 1925, K. Hasebroek made an early attempt to prove this hypothesis, exposing pupae to pollutant gases, namely hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), and &quot;pyredin&quot;. He used eight species in his studies, four of which were species of butterfly that did not exhibit melanism. 

In 1926 and 1928, Heslop-Harrison suggested that the increase of melanic moths in industrialised regions was due to &quot;mutation pressure&quot;, not to selection by predators which he regarded as negligible. Salts of lead and manganese were present in the airborne pollutant particles, and he suggested that these caused the mutation of genes for melanin production but of no others. He used &quot;Selenia bilunaria&quot; and &quot;Tephrosia bistortata&quot; as material. The larvae were fed with leaves that had incorporated these salts: melanics subsequently appeared. A similar experiment in 1932 by McKenney Hughes failed to replicate these results; the statistician and geneticist Ronald Fisher showed that Heslop-Harrison&#x27;s controls were inadequate, and that Hughes&#x27;s findings made the 6% mutation rate required by Heslop-Harrison &quot;improbable&quot;.

== Kettlewell&#x27;s experiment ==

The first important experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell at Oxford University, under the supervision of E. B. Ford, who helped him gain a grant from the Nuffield Foundation to perform the experiments. In 1953, Kettlewell started a preliminary experiment in which moths were released into a large (18m × 6m) aviary, where they were fed on by great tits (&quot;Parus major&quot;). His main experiment, at Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve in Birmingham, England, involved marking, releasing, and recapturing marked moths. He found that in this polluted woodland &quot;typica&quot; moths were preferentially preyed upon. He thus showed that the melanic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in unpolluted woodlands in Dorset, and again in the polluted woods in Birmingham. In 1956 he repeated the experiments and found similar results; in Birmingham, birds ate most of the white moths (75%), whereas in Dorset, most of the dark moths (86%) were eaten.

=== Criticisms ===

Theodore David Sargent performed experiments between 1965 and 1969, from which he concluded that it was not possible to reproduce Kettlewell&#x27;s results, and said that birds showed no preference for moths on either black or white tree trunks. He suggested that Kettlewell had trained the birds to pick moths on tree trunks to obtain the desired results.

Two chapters in Michael Majerus&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;&quot; critiqued the research in Kettlewell&#x27;s &quot;The Evolution of Melanism&quot;, discussed studies which raised questions about Kettlewell&#x27;s original experimental methods, and called for further research. Reviewing the book, Jerry Coyne noted these points, and concluded that &quot;for the time being we must discard &quot;Biston&quot; as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom.&quot;

Judith Hooper&#x27;s book &quot;Of Moths and Men&quot; (2002) severely criticised Kettlewell&#x27;s experiment. Hooper argued that Kettlewell&#x27;s field notes could not be found and suggested that his experiment was fraudulent, on the basis of Sargent&#x27;s criticisms alleging that the photographs of the moths were taken of dead moths placed on a log. She said that E. B. Ford was a &quot;Darwinian zealot&quot;, and claimed that he exploited the scientifically naive Kettlewell to obtain the desired experimental results. The book&#x27;s reception led to demands that the peppered moth evolution story be deleted from textbooks. Scientists have examined the allegations made by Hooper, and found them to be without merit.

Phillip E. Johnson, a co-founder of the creationist intelligent design movement, said that the moths &quot;do not sit on tree trunks&quot;, that &quot;moths had to be glued to the trunks&quot; for pictures, and that the experiments were &quot;fraudulent&quot; and a &quot;scam.&quot; The intelligent design advocate Jonathan Wells wrote an essay on the subject, a shortened version of which appeared in the 24 May 1999 issue of &quot;The Scientist&quot;, claiming that &quot;The fact that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks invalidates Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments&quot;. Wells further wrote in his 2000 book &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot; that &quot;What the textbooks don&#x27;t explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don&#x27;t even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged.&quot; However, peppered moths do rest on tree trunks on occasion, and Nick Matzke states that there is little difference between the &#x27;staged&#x27; photos and &#x27;unstaged&#x27; ones.

== Majerus&#x27;s experiment ==

From 2001 to 2007, Majerus carried out experiments in Cambridge to resolve the various criticisms of Kettlewell&#x27;s experiment. During his experiment, he noted the natural resting positions of peppered moths. Of the 135 moths examined, over half were on tree branches, mostly on the lower half of the branch; 37% were on tree trunks, mostly on the north side; and only 12.6% were resting on or under twigs. Following correspondence with Hooper, he added an experiment to find if bats, not birds, could be the main predators. He observed a number of species of bird actually preying on the moths, and found that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in &quot;carbonaria&quot; frequency compared to &quot;typica&quot;. He described his results as a complete vindication of the natural selection theory of peppered moth evolution, and said &quot;If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution.&quot; 

Majerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, so the work was carried on by Cook, Grant, Saccheri, and James Mallet, and published on 8 February 2012 as &quot;Selective bird predation on the peppered moth: the last experiment of Michael Majerus.&quot; The experiment became the largest ever in the study of industrial melanism, involving 4,864 individuals in a six-year investigation, and it confirmed that melanism in moths is a genuine example of natural selection involving camouflage and predation. Their concluding remark runs: &quot;These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths.&quot;

Coyne said he was &quot;delighted to agree with this conclusion [of Majerus&#x27;s experiment], which answers my previous criticisms about the &quot;Biston&quot; story.&quot;

<doc id="628770" wikidata="Q14628967" url="?curid=628770" title="Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge">
<text>The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge (known as the New Mississippi River Bridge until its formal naming in 2013 and informally known as the &quot;Stan Span&quot;) is a bridge across the Mississippi River in the United States between St. Clair County, Illinois, and the city of St. Louis, Missouri. Built between April 19, 2010, and July 2013, the bridge opened on February 9, 2014. The cable-stayed bridge has a main span of . 

==Features==

The main span of the bridge is in length, part of a total span of . It is wide. Cables stretch from the bridge deck to the tops of two A-shaped towers, which reach above I-70. The new bridge&#x27;s main span is supported by of stay-cable strand, enough for nearly two round trips from St. Louis to Chicago. Nearly 15,000 tons of structural steel are used, along with 8,600 tons of reinforcing steel. Some of concrete are in the foundation, deck slab, and towers. At its completion, the bridge was the third-longest cable-stayed bridge in the United States.

===Traffic===
The bridge was built to relieve traffic on nearby bridges, and to expand with traffic in the future. It carries four mainline traffic lanes, half as many as originally planned, with room to add a lane in each direction. It is designed so that a companion bridge could be built beside it. Initially, the new bridge was intended to reduce traffic by 20% on the Poplar Street Bridge, which carries I-55, I-64, and US 40 (also the former route of I-70); and 50% on the Martin Luther King Bridge.

After three months of use, it was estimated that 31,000 cars and trucks cross the bridge every day, about 10,000 less than the expected 40,000. Traffic volume on the nearby McKinley Bridge has not changed. The MLK Bridge traffic is down 44%. The Eads Bridge is down 3,000 cars per day, a 27% decrease compared to 2013. The Poplar Street Bridge, the busiest in the area, has had volume reduced by 20,000 cars per day, a 19% decrease. After 3 years of use of the new Stan Musial-Veterans Memorial Bridge, the daily traffic has increased to 53,700 per day, over 13,000 more than the expected 40,000.

===Road redesignations===
At the bridge&#x27;s opening, I-70 was re-routed, diverging from the current I-70 at Cass Avenue to connect with I-55/I-64/I-70 in East St. Louis. The remaining stretch of I-70 through downtown St. Louis became an extension of I-44. After these realignments, the Poplar Street Bridge continues to carry traffic for I-55, I-64 and US 40.

==Funding==

===Budget===
The cost of the original design of the bridge and surrounding area was estimated at nearly $1.7 billion. After both state governments decided that they could not bear that cost, they called for a new design; this proposed a smaller size and was submitted in 2007 with an estimated cost of $667 million. Of the total, $264 million will go to move I-70 in Illinois, $57 million to move I-70 in Missouri, and $346 million to build the bridge. The Illinois state government plans to spend $313 million; Missouri, $115 million. A federal grant will cover the other $239 million. The final cost was $695 million.

===Toll bridge proposal===
The funding of the bridge project was debated by the Illinois and Missouri governments. After receiving the federal grant, Illinois pushed to start as soon as possible, but Missouri said it had more pressing highway projects to work on. Missouri transportation officials proposed to privatize the bridge, which would have allowed a private company to charge tolls in return for building, operating and maintaining it for up to 99 years. But Illinois officials and several St. Louis congressman demanded a toll-free crossing, and this was ratified by an agreement signed February 28, 2008, by Missouri governor Matt Blunt and Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich.

===Bids===
The cost of building the main span was initially estimated at $190 million. This proved low; a $229.5 million contract was awarded on December 30, 2009, to a joint venture of Massman Construction Co. of Kansas City, Traylor Bros. Inc. of Indiana and St. Louis-based Alberici Corp. (The team beat out the $274.9 million bid by a joint venture of American Bridge Co. and Dragados USA.)
MoDOT agreed to cover any cost overruns. This has prompted speculation that the project might be scaled back.

==Design and construction==

Subsurface exploration by engineering firm Modjeski and Masters showed thick deposits of low-density sand below the water table. Such loose sand might liquefy during an earthquake. Several ways to reduce the risk were considered, including in-situ densification of the sands, but ultimately the foundations were changed to feature , drilled piers founded in the limestone bedrock to support the bridge superstructure. The bedrock is below the surface on the Illinois side and between 30 and on the Missouri side.

===Land sale===
In 2003, land intended to be used for the bridge was sold by the City of St. Louis Land Reutilization Authority to a private developer for $2. In early 2008, MoDOT warned the developer not to build on it, but the developer completed the construction of 400 storage units. MoDOT offered a $1.7 million buyout, which the developer turned down. The property was condemned, and a circuit court ordered MoDOT to give the developer $2.3 million in compensation. MoDOT is contesting this amount.

===Minority labor controversies===
In August 2011, community leaders in East St. Louis, which suffers high unemployment, lodged complaints with the Illinois Department of Transportation that the bridge labor force included too few minority workers. Federal law requires that the labor force on any public works project that is fully or partially funded by federal dollars must be composed of at least 14.6% members of a recognized minority group. The project meets these requirements, according to contractor records; the activists argued that the labor force was not representative of those living in the region. A protest and work stoppage on the Illinois portion of the bridge was threatened, but work on the bridge continued.

Riley Illinois, a firm that is supplying concrete for the project, was de-listed as a minority-owned business when Illinois officials discovered that only one of the four owners of the firm was a minority. Though the company continued its contract to provide concrete for the bridge, it no longer counted as a minority-owned firm.

===Construction accident===
At 10:30 a.m. on March 28, 2012, carpenter Andy Gammon plunged to his death in the river when a barge-mounted lift toppled and a rescue effort failed. Gammon was working on pilings from a boom lift that was placed on a secured barge. The mobile piece of equipment was not secured to the barge and tipped over into the water, taking him in the boom with it. Gammon&#x27;s body was found attached to the lift. OSHA cited the three general contractors and the subcontractor for three violations totalling $15,300. The stretch of I-70 from the bridge to I-44 is designated the Andy Gammon Memorial Highway.

==Naming==
In August 2004, William Perkins and Russ Reike, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, gave Rep. Jerry Costello (D-IL) petitions with over 4,000 signatures supporting the naming of the new bridge &quot;Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot;. There is a Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River. The Martin Luther King Bridge was originally called &quot;Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot; until it was renamed in 1968 following the assassination of the national civil rights leader. The naming proposal was supported by Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) and Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. When the bridge was delayed by Missouri&#x27;s postponement of funding, the petitions expired. Perkins and Reiki, joined by fellow VFW member Dave Stout, collected signatures again and in 2009 tuned over to Rep. Costello petitions with more than 13,000 names.

On August 28, 2005, the Missouri State Legislature voted to name the bridge after President Ronald Reagan.

In March 2011, the Missouri House of Representatives approved a proposal to change the name to &quot;Jerry F. Costello–William Lacy &#x27;Bill&#x27; Clay Sr. Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot;, for two prominent state politicians. One month later, the Missouri Senate Transportation Committee rejected the change.

Some groups pushed for &quot;Women Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot;.

On January 22, 2013, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Glendale, Missouri) introduced a bill to name the bridge after Stan Musial, the former St. Louis Cardinals baseball player who had recently died. The measure required the approval of both houses of both the Illinois and Missouri legislatures. The measure received the first of two necessary approvals from the Missouri Senate on February 20, 2013. An amendment to the Musial bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary Romine (R-Farmington, Missouri), named the Missouri approach to the bridge the Andy Gammon Memorial Highway in honor of the bridge worker who died.

The two state legislatures agreed; the bridge was officially named the &quot;Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge&quot;, with the signature of President Barack Obama on July 12, 2013.

<text>The Deadly Desert is the magical desert in Nonestica that completely surrounds the fictional Land of Oz, which cuts it off from the rest of the world.

==Geology==
On the map of Oz, first published in the endpapers of the eighth book, &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), the eastern quadrant of the desert is called the &quot;Deadly Desert&quot;, while the other three quadrants of desert are called the &quot;Shifting Sands&quot;, the &quot;Impassable Desert&quot;, and the &quot;Great Sandy Waste&quot;.

The desert was originally described as dangerous as any natural desert but no more. Indeed, in the second book, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), the witch Mombi tries to escape through it in the form of a griffin, and Glinda chases her over the sands. In the third book, &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), it has become a magical desert with life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant through the rest of the series.

In the fifth book, &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), a sign is posted on the edge of the desert to warn travelers: 

ALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO VENTURE UPON THIS DESERTFor the Deadly Sands Will Turn Any Living Flesh to Dust in an Instant.Beyond This Barrier is theLAND OF OZBut no one can Reach that Beautiful Country because of these Destroying Sands.

The desert is used as a literary device to explain why Oz is essentially cut off from the rest of the world and the rest of the surrounding countries of Nonestica. However, it has been crossed several times by people from within Oz and from the outside world, with applied ingenuity, with magical assistance, or through unusual natural phenomena. In fact, no one in the Oz series is ever seen to die in the desert.

==Notable crossings==
* In the 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Dorothy Gale is carried into Oz in her house by a cyclone and back over again by her Silver Shoes, which fall off during her flight and are lost in the desert. Also, the Wizard of Oz originally arrived in Oz by a circus balloon (which he implies functioned by a gas lighter than air, rather than hot air), and years later leaves Oz in a hot-air balloon of his own design.
* In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, Tip and his companions fly over it using The Gump who was granted flight with its palm leaf parts.
* In &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, Princess Ozma crosses the desert with her whole court by use of an infinitely unrolling carpet.
* In &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, Dorothy Gale, Shaggy Man, Polychrome and Button-Bright cross the desert into Oz by use of a sand ship.
* In &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, the Nome King and his allies the Whimsies, the Growleywogs, and the Phanfasms dug a tunnel underneath the desert.
* In &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, Trot, Cap&#x27;n Bill, and Button-Bright flew over the desert carried by birds and led by Flipper the Ork.
* In &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot;, Kiki Aru transformed himself into a bird and flew over the Deadly Desert from the Land of Oz, exploring the various countries of Nonestica.
* In &quot;Kabumpo in Oz&quot;, a giant Ruggedo hopped right over the Deadly Desert and ran back to his mountain in the Land of Ev after Princess Ozma&#x27;s palace got stuck in his hair spikes. In the same book, Kabumpo, Peg Amy, Pompadore, and Wag crossed over the Deadly Desert on a runaway country.
* In &quot;The Purple Prince of Oz&quot;, Polychrome allowed Prince Randy, Kabumpo, and Jinnicky the Red Jinn to ride her rainbow across the Deadly Desert.
* In &quot;Handy Mandy in Oz&quot;, a geyser beneath Mt. Mern in an unidentified area erupted underneath Handy Mandy sending her and the large boulder she was on over the Deadly Desert where she landed in Munchkin Country.
* In &quot;The Silver Princess in Oz&quot;, Kabumpo and King Randy were blown across the Deadly Desert by a powerful storm.

==In other media==
* In the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, Dorothy Gale crosses the edge of the Desert by stepping upon stones. Later, the pack of Wheelers working for Mombi fail to get across the Deadly Desert in pursuit of Dorothy and the Gump, who cross the desert to reach the Nome King&#x27;s mountain. Six of the Wheelers fall into the desert and are subsequently turned into sand and killed. The seven remaining Wheelers later return with Princess Mombi and cross the desert through the tunnel that was dug underneath the desert to reach the Nome King&#x27;s mountain.

* In &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Deadly Desert is featured where it also contained a monster made of sand.
