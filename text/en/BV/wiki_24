==History==
===Early settlers===
Point Cook was originally spelled Point Cooke, and named in 1836. Almost all references dropped the &quot;e&quot;; however, in the early 2000s the point itself was officially renamed &quot;Point Cooke&quot;. Point Cook was named after John M. Cooke, mate of His Majesty&#x27;s vessel &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. Commanded by Captain Hobson, the ship charted part of the Port Phillip Bay in 1836.

William Drayton Taylor leased the land around Point Cook promontory in 1849. The following year in 1850 Taylor transferred his licence to Alexander Irvine. By March 1852, a six-room weatherboard cottage had been erected.

In 1853 the pastoralist Thomas Chirnside added the farmlands of Point Cook to his holdings. He built the famous Point Cook Homestead of twenty-five rooms in 1857. Initially Point Cook was an important segment of the expanding pastoral empire established by Thomas and his brother Andrew. As their extensive land holdings were developed substantial homesteads were later constructed at Werribee Park, Carranballac, Mount Williams and Curnong.

Due to the Chirnside brothers&#x27; deep interest in hunting, deer and foxes were introduced to Point Cook in the 1850s. As early as 1859 members of the Melbourne Hunt Club and the Geelong &amp; District Hunt Club were invited to hunt at Point Cook. In the early 1860s Thomas Chirnside imported valuable horses for the breeding at Point Cook. The property was said to have three racetracks. The Chirnside&#x27;s became one of Victoria&#x27;s prominent pastoral families, entertaining the colonial gentry and organising sporting functions for their guests at Point Cook.

In 1873 the Chirnside brothers began construction of the elaborate mansion at Werribee Park. By 1877 the Werribee Park Mansion had been completed and it largely displaced the Point Cook Homestead as their families&#x27; focus.

===Early 20th century===
In 1912 the Federal Government purchased a large section of Point Cook with a vision to establish the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). Due to the success of the AFC in the First World War, the AFC was renamed the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and this led to the eventual renaming of the AFC base at Point Cook to RAAF Base Point Cook. Point Cook remained the RAAF&#x27;s only base until 1925 when RAAF Base Richmond and the nearby RAAF Base Laverton were built. Point Cook is considered the birthplace and the spiritual home of the RAAF. Today the RAAF Base Point Cook is the home of the RAAF College including Officers Training School (OTS) and the RAAF Museum.

In 1920 the Chirnside family sold the remainder of the Point Cook property to Sydney Dalrymple. This ended nearly 70 years of the Chirnside family&#x27;s ownership of Point Cook. Four years later in 1924 Dalrymple sold the northern part of the Point Cook land to Cheetham Salt Pty Ltd for salt recovery lagoons.

Point Cook Post Office opened in 1926, was renamed Point Cook R.A.A.F. Post Office in 1940, and closed in 1993. A new Point Cook office opened in 2005 subsequent to suburban development in the area.

Cheetham Salt established a series of ponds in the 1920s where sea water was fed into the shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate. Dried salt was then harvested from the floor of the lagoons. This operation continued until the early 1990s, when the site was purchased by the Victorian Government. The more environmentally important bayside part of the original saltworks now comprises Cheetham Wetlands which make up the migratory bird habitat and conservation area that is there today. The higher, western section is being developed privately by various housing estates, such as Sanctuary Lakes that are there today. In 1948 Point Cook hosted the Australian Grand Prix, which was held at the Point Cook RAAF Base. The race was won by Frank Pratt driving a BMW 328.

===Today===
In 1996, Point Cook was basically a rural community, with the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) Base. Point Cook&#x27;s population in 1996 was approximately 580, of whom 552 lived on the RAAF base. By 2001, Point Cook&#x27;s population had increased to 1,737, and by August 2006 the population of Point Cook was 14,162 as per the 2006 Australian Census. Today Point Cook is one of the major growth regions in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs.

At the 2011 Census, Point Cook recorded a population of 32,413 and it was originally estimated in 2006 that the population would be 41,474 by 2016. The 2016 Census revealed that the actual population in June 2016 was much higher at 49,929.

During the 2016 Census, it was found there were 13,593 families living in Point Cook, with an average of 1.1 child per family. 50.1% of Point Cook&#x27;s population were males, 49.9% being females.

In Point Cook, 48.4% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were India 9.1%, China 6.4%, New Zealand 4.0%, United Kingdom 3.2% and Philippines 2.1%. 51.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.4%, Hindi 4.4%, Cantonese 2.3%, Indonesian 1.6% and Punjabi 1.6%. The most common responses for religion in Point Cook were No Religion 27.7%, Catholic 23.7% and Hinduism 10.0%.

At the time of the 2021 Census, Point Cook was found to be the most multicultural suburb in Australia. The suburb&#x27;s population hail from 86 countries with at least 20 residents from each of those countries. About 70 per cent of residents have both parents born overseas, and it also has the largest number of different languages spoken at home.

==Facilities==
===Internet===
Selected areas of Point Cook are currently taking part in Telstra&#x27;s FTTP broadband network. Up to 1,500 Point Cook homes now have access to a download capacity of up to 100 Mbit/s. This will involve replacement of the copper with fibre line to the home. This delivers Internet, digital free-to-air TV, Foxtel from Telstra and multiple HomeLine services all from one cable with no need for rooftop antennas or dishes. Telstra has also recently introduced ADSL 2+ to several areas of Point Cook.

Outside of areas with Fibre to the Premises (FTTP), Internet services in Point Cook are considered by most residents to be well below that expected of a developing suburb. Many residents are unable to obtain ADSL services (either v1 or v2) due to the limited capacity of the local Point Cook telephone exchange to provide these services. Also, due to the design of the copper telephone network in Point Cook, many residents are on RIMs not suitably provisioned for ADSL, restricting their Internet services to dial-up, or wireless technologies such as 3G. HFC cable services are not available in the suburb.

During 2018, much of Point Cook was connected to the National Broadband Network. Most homes are connected to the NBN via FTTC. Fibre to the Curb allows network speeds of up to 100 M/bits. However, NBNCo says future upgrades to FTTC may allow network speeds of up to 1 G/bit in the coming years.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel John By (7 August 1779 – 1 February 1836) was an English military engineer. He is best known for having supervised the construction of the Rideau Canal and for having founded Bytown in the process. It developed and was designated as the Canadian capital, Ottawa.

==Life and career==
By was born in Lambeth, Surrey, the second of three sons of George By, of the London Customs House, and Mary Bryan. Nothing certain is known about By’s early education; Andrews suggests that it could have been at Sir Thomas Rich&#x27;s School in Longlevens. He gained a good knowledge of arithmetic and writing; competence in English, French and Latin; and some drawing skills, as he was admitted at age 13 to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He graduated from the academy in 1799. 

In August of that year, he was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery; by the end of the year he had transferred to the Royal Engineers. In 1800 he was posted to the fortifications at Plymouth, which were being modernised.

In July 1802 By was posted to Canada, where he worked on the fortification of Quebec City and on improving the navigability of the Saint Lawrence River. 
In early 1811 By returned to England. He was almost immediately posted to Portugal, where he served during the Napoleonic wars before falling ill (probably with malaria); he was back in England in August. The Royal Engineers&#x27; Window in Rochester Cathedral indicates that By served without injury during the conflicts.

In 1812, By was appointed Commanding Royal Engineer of the Royal Gunpowder Mills in Waltham Abbey. A huge explosion had occurred there on 27 November 1811, when &quot;no. 4 Press House and the adjoining Corning House blew up, killing seven workmen and breaking windows in Hackney ten miles away.&quot; By directed the reconstruction of the corning house and built two new gunpowder mills. He also introduced two new presses to replace the twelve that had been lost. The new presses, and a new design of charcoal press, proved to be more efficient and cheaper to run.

At the end of the war, By retired from the military. In 1826, because of his engineering experience in Canada, he was recalled and assigned there to supervise the construction of the Rideau Canal between Ottawa and Kingston. Since the canal was to begin in the wild and sparsely populated Ottawa River valley, his first task was the construction of a town to house the workmen and labourers of associated services. The resulting settlement, called Bytown in his honour, was later renamed after the river. It was designated as the capital of Canada.

The canal was completed in six years, and was acclaimed as an engineering triumph. It had huge cost overruns, however, and became a political scandal for the Board of Ordnance. Colonel By was recalled to London, where he was accused of having made unauthorised expenditures. The charges were spurious, and a parliamentary committee exonerated him. By petitioned Wellington and other military leaders to review his case, but the damage was done. He was forced to retire and never received a formal commendation for his great achievement on the canal. By retired to Frant in Sussex and died in 1836, and is buried in the village of Frant.

===Family===
John By married twice. He first married Elizabeth Johnson Baines, daughter of a naval captain, at Madron on 12 November 1801. Elizabeth died in December 1814 and was buried on 16 December at Cheshunt. 

Secondly, he married Esther March in Cheshunt on 14 March 1818. John and Esther had two daughters: Harriet Martha, born on 14 March 1821 in Frant. She died unmarried on 2 October 1842 and was buried at St. Alban&#x27;s churchyard in Frant. Her parents were later buried there near her.

The second daughter was Esther March, born on 18 February 1819 in Marylebone, She married Percy Ashburnham, a younger son of the George, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham, in Ticehurst in 1838, and had two children: Esther Harriet in 1844, who died the following year; and Mary Catherine in 1847, who died aged three. Esther March Ashburnham died on 6 February 1848 and was also buried at Frant. 

By was survived by two brothers: 
* George By – born 1779, died 1840, without children 
* Henry By – born 1780, married; died 1852. He was buried in West Hoathly. He was predeceased by his son in 1847 (who had no children).

==Legacy==
John was honored in numerous places: 
* The &quot;Byward Market&quot; area of Ottawa&#x27;s Lower Town was named for him.
* His statue, executed by Joseph-Émile Brunet and unveiled in 1971, stands in nearby Major&#x27;s Hill Park.
* Ottawa&#x27;s Colonel By Secondary School was named for him.
* The scenic parkway of Colonel By Drive was named for him. It follows the first stretch of the canal 8 km through the city from Rideau Street in Lower Town to the falls at Hogs Back.
* The engineering building, Col. By Hall, was unveiled in September 2005 at the University of Ottawa: 
&quot;Colonel By Hall 161 Louis Pasteur – Colonel By Hall, home to the Faculty of Engineering, is named in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers, who led the construction of the Rideau Canal. Completed in 1832, the Rideau Canal was a remarkable engineering endeavour at the time, connecting a series of lakes and rivers to provide a secure supply route from Lake Ontario to Bytown, which became the city of Ottawa 150 years ago. September 2005&quot;

* In 1979, to commemorate the bicentenary of his birth, Canada Post issued a stamp bearing his image.
* In Ottawa, &quot;Colonel By Day&quot; is the name given to the Ontario August civic holiday.
* Colonel By Lake is an artificial lake on the Rideau Canal.
*Colonel By Park is a waterfront park at Upper Brewers Locks on the Rideau Canal.
* Colonel By Valley was named for him on 26 September 1976, 150 years to the day that he and the Earl of Dalhousie, the Governor of British North America, chose the site as the beginning of the canal.

==Sundial==
A sundial behind the present-day site of East Block on Parliament Hill and overlooking the set of locks was used on that site by the Royal Sappers and Miners under Lt Colonel John By, RE in 1826–27. It was restored in 1919. During the construction of the Rideau Canal, Barracks Hill was the site of the military barracks and military hospital.

===Plaques===

A historical plaque located on the grounds of Colonel By Secondary School states, 
&quot;Colonel John By (1779–1836) was born and educated in England and first came to Canada in 1802. As a member of the Royal Engineers, he worked on the first small locks on the St. Lawrence River as well as the fortifications of Quebec. He returned to England in 1811 and fought in the Peninsular War, but came back to Canada in 1826 to spend five summers heading the construction of the Rideau Canal, the 200 km long waterway, which now connects Ottawa and Kingston. This formidable task included the building of about 50 dams and 47 locks, without the aid of modern equipment. But the amazing feat was never recognized in Colonel By&#x27;s own lifetime, and he died three years after its completion, never imagining that many thousands of Canadians would greatly admire and value his achievement in the centuries to come. Colonel By&#x27;s attributes of courage, determination, and diligence inspire us to emulate him, in the hopes that we too may somehow serve our country in a way which will benefit future generations.&quot;

A plaque was erected by the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board at Jones Falls Lockstation commemorating Lieutenant Colonel John By, Royal Engineers, the superintending engineer in charge of the construction of the Rideau Canal. The plaque notes that the 123-mile long Rideau Canal, built as a military route and incorporating 47 locks, 16 lakes, two rivers, and a , dam at Jones Falls, was completed in 1832.

A plaque was installed by the Province of Ontario in the stairwell of Lambeth Town Hall, in Brixton, London, England, commemorating By&#x27;s Lambeth origins.

<doc id="615324" wikidata="Q2563357" url="?curid=615324" title="Werribee, Victoria">
<text>Werribee is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the local government area of the City of Wyndham. Werribee recorded a population of 50,027 at the 2021 census.

Werribee was established as an agricultural settlement in the 1850s, originally named Wyndham and later renamed Werribee (derived from the Aboriginal name meaning &quot;backbone&quot; or &quot;spine&quot;) in 1904. The suburb is situated on its namesake the Werribee River, approximately halfway between Melbourne and Geelong, on the Princes Highway. It is the administrative centre of the City of Wyndham local government area and is the City&#x27;s most populous centre. Werribee is part of the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area and is included in the capital&#x27;s population statistical division.

Since the 1990s, the suburb has experienced rapid suburban growth into surrounding greenfield land, becoming a commuter town in the Melbourne–Geelong growth corridor. Due to this urban sprawl, Wyndham and its suburbs have merged into the Melbourne conurbation. In recent years, Werribee has undergone development which has seen the growth of high-rise buildings within the city centre.

The suburb is best known for its major tourist attractions, which include the former estate of wealthy pastoralist Thomas Chirnside, known as Werribee Park, the Victoria State Rose Garden, the Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre, and the Werribee Open Range Zoo.

==History==
The name &quot;Werribee&quot; originated from the Victorian Aboriginal name for the Werribee River, &quot;Wirribi-yaluk&quot; in Wathawurrung and Boonwurrung, &quot;wirribi&quot; meaning &quot;backbone&quot; or &quot;spine&quot;.

Early leasing of pastures was led by members of John Batman&#x27;s Port Phillip Association. A rural township began in the early 1850s. This village was named Wyndham (the name of the local municipality today). The name derived from a suggestion by the owner of a local village inn, Elliott Armstrong, who sought to honour Scottish soldier Sir Henry Wyndham. The Post Office opened on 12 January 1858 as Wyndham and was renamed Werribee in 1904. However, its adjacent river was called the Werribee River, and the town&#x27;s name was later changed to Werribee in 1884, and the Shire Council at that time was also renamed Werribee in 1909. The Shire at the time was quite large; extending from the inner Western suburbs of Melbourne to Little River to the northward town of Melton, covering 715 square kilometres.

Werribee at this time was very popular for development. Thomas Chirnside, a person famous in this area even today, was attracted to the open plain&#x27;s suitability for agricultural uses. By 1863 he controlled more than 280 square kilometres around Werribee. Chirnside bought other smaller holdings of land at this time. The town grew steadily, helped by a railway line from Melbourne to Geelong, with a station at Werribee in 1857.

Thomas Chirnside committed suicide in 1887. He was found dead in the laundry at Werribee Park with a shotgun lying beside him. His brother Andrew died three years later, and the property was now divided between Andrew&#x27;s two sons. A new mansion was built, called &quot;The Manor&quot; (not in the same place as the current suburb of Manor Lakes).

In 1881 a quarter of the Shire&#x27;s population lived in the Werribee Township. There were hotels there, as well as recreational venues such as the Werribee Racecourse (built in 1879) as well as the Mechanics&#x27; Institute (built in 1883).

From 1923 to 1973, Chirnside&#x27;s property was the site of Corpus Christi College, the seminary of the Catholic Church for Victoria and Tasmania.

Werribee has the highest rates of crime in Wyndham, with recent significant crime increases.

==Neighbouring suburbs==

Werribee&#x27;s central business district is located along Watton Street; the civic centre (council chambers) being just 500 metres away also makes it the administrative centre of the City of Wyndham. Werribee is surrounded by several mostly residential suburbs: Wyndham Vale to the north-west, Hoppers Crossing and Tarneit to the north, Truganina and Williams Landing to the north-east, and Point Cook to the east. The market gardens and well-known tourist precinct are found in Werribee South, on the other side of the Maltby Bypass.

The area&#x27;s major regional shopping centre, the Pacific Werribee Shopping Centre is actually located just across the suburb boundary in Hoppers Crossing.

==Transport==

===Road===
Werribee&#x27;s town centre and its Civic Centre (council offices) are located adjacent to the Princes Highway, known locally as Synnot Street. Major local arterial roads Derrimut Road and Old Geelong Road (as an extension of Morris Road) connect the highway to the City of Wyndham&#x27;s north, as does Cherry Street. Ballan Road is the major arterial to Wyndham&#x27;s north-west.

The CBD also links with the Princes Freeway via Duncans Road to the south-east, and via Geelong Road (the continuation of the Princes Highway) to the south west. The Princes Freeway circumvents the township via a section, known as the Maltby Bypass, which opened in June 1961.

===Public transport===

There are two major railway stations in the area – Werribee railway station and Hoppers Crossing railway station to the north-east, both part of the Melbourne metropolitan network. Werribee station is the terminus of the Werribee line. V/Line services to and from Geelong ceased in mid 2015 due to the completion of the Regional Rail Link which sees trains diverted out towards Wyndham Vale.

A disused station exists on the line near Werribee Racecourse, which at times has had calls to be reopened. Additionally, tracks have been left spread apart for a future station near Derrimut Road. Further suburban stations to the north and west have been constructed on a new line as part of the Regional Rail Link to be joined with the regional rail network.

An extensive bus network links Werribee with neighbouring suburbs, with major bus interchanges at Werribee station, Wyndham Vale railway station, Tarneit railway station, Pacific Werribee and Hoppers Crossing station.

===Cycling===

Wyndham City Council is consistently one of the highest spending councils when it comes to bicycle infrastructure. Thus Werribee is well served with bike paths and bike lanes.

Major trails include:
* The Federation Trail – from Werribee River to Millers Road, Altona North;
* The Werribee River Trail – from Davis Creek, Tarneit, connecting with the Federation Trail, and continuing south towards Werribee Park.

==Health==
The City of Wyndham and surrounding areas are serviced by the Werribee Mercy Hospital, which opened in 1994 to replace the now defunct Werribee District Hospital. It is a major provider of mental health care and maternity services for the local area.

A new multi disciplinary, purpose-built medical facility was recently built opposite the Mercy Hospital, to be known as Wyndham Private Medical Centre. It includes a general practice clinic, specialist suites, allied health, mental health and pathology services.

Werribee Bears play rugby league in NRL Victoria.

<text>KH-5 ARGON was a series of reconnaissance satellites produced by the United States from February 1961 to August 1964. The KH-5 operated similarly to the CORONA series of satellites, as it ejected a canister of photographic film. At least 12 missions were attempted, but at least 7 resulted in failure. The satellite was manufactured by Lockheed. Launches used Thor-Agena launch vehicles flying from Vandenberg Air Force Base, with the payload being integrated into the Agena.

== Payload ==
Different versions of the satellite varied in mass from . At least two missions deployed ELINT subsatellites. Ground resolution for the satellite was , with a swath of . The onboard camera had a focal length of 76 mm. The purpose of the system, which produced relatively low-resolution images compared to other spy satellites, was to provide imagery for cartography purposes. This was one of the tasks that had originally been planned for the SAMOS series of satellites equipped with the (quickly cancelled) E-4 cameras. Each satellite took photographs for less than a week before returning its film.

The satellite was in use during the same period as the KH-2 to KH-4A CORONA and the KH-6 LANYARD satellites. Later satellites were the KH-4B and KH-7 GAMBIT. Images from three of the successful missions returned the first images of Antarctica from space.

== Satellites ==
Discoverer 20 (KH-5 9014A), was a USAF photographic reconnaissance satellite under the supervision of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Discoverer 20 was the first KH-5 ARGON satellite to be launched. The launch occurred at 20:24:00 GMT on 17 February 1961. A Thor DM-21 Agena-B launch vehicle was used, flying from LC 75-3-4 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was assigned the Harvard designation 1961 Epsilon 1. Discoverer 20 was operated in an Earth orbit, with a perigee of , an apogee of , 80.91° of inclination, and a period of 95.81 minutes. The satellite was equipped with a camera with a focal length of 76 mm, which had a resolution of . Images were recorded onto 127 mm film, and were to have been returned in a Satellite Recovery Vehicle (SRV) before the satellite ceased operations. The satellite weighed . Recovery of the capsule was not attempted due to a system malfunction, and thus the scientific experiment data obtained were limited. Discoverer 20 decayed on 28 July 1962.

<doc id="615327" wikidata="Q1854516" url="?curid=615327" title="Braybrook, Victoria">
<text>Braybrook is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maribyrnong local government area. Braybrook recorded a population of 9,682 at the .

==History==
Braybrook Post Office opened on 1 December 1860.

Braybrook is primarily an industrial suburb.

==Today==

Approximately midway between the former Councils of Footscray and Sunshine in the heart of the western suburbs before the more recent urban sprawl and due west from the Melbourne CBD along Ballarat Road, Braybrook is starting to resemble a bedroom community due to a recent expansion of the western suburbs of Melbourne which are far less populated than the east. Historically this is due to stigma, but the western suburbs are expanding now due to prime location and rising fuel prices. Some gentrification has occurred in the past decade with many former factory sites developed for modern housing projects (townhouses etc.). More and more first home buyers and developers are focusing on Braybrook and neighbouring Maidstone and West Footscray, but traces of its industrial past may be still evident.

Braybrook has been ranked 95 out of top 314 most liveable suburbs in Melbourne in the &quot;2011 Liveability Stakes&quot; by The Age and The Melbourne Magazine.

==People==
The suburb has produced a number of famous sporting and show business personalities. The late 1960s pop singer Yvonne Barrett resided with her family in Dodds Street. Yvonne Barrett was murdered in 1985, with her funeral service held at Braybrook&#x27;s Christ The King Catholic church in Churchill Avenue. 1970&#x27;s Pop sensation Jamie Redfern also lived in the area. Ray &quot;Screamy&quot; Eames, the drummer from popular Melbourne pub-rock act The Blue Echoes lived in Braybrook.

<doc id="615328" wikidata="Q7398860" url="?curid=615328" title="Sag (geology)">
<text>In geology a sag, or trough, is a depressed, persistent, low area; the opposite of an arch, or ridge, a raised, persistent, high area. The terms sag and arch were used historically to describe very large features, for example, characterizing North America as two arches with a sag between them. 

Also, a sag is a former river bed which has been partially filled with debris from glaciation or other natural processes but which is still visible in the surface terrain. Sags formed by the former river beds of large rivers often become the valleys of smaller streams after a change of course by the main river.

Examples of sags include the former continuations of the Grand, Moreau, and White rivers in South Dakota in the United States. Before the last ice age, these rivers continued eastward past their current confluences with the present course of Missouri River. The sags are prominently visible on the plateau of the Missouri Coteau, allowing small streams to drain into the Missouri from its eastern side.

<doc id="615333" wikidata="Q5466574" url="?curid=615333" title="Footscray, Victoria">
<text>Footscray ( ) is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maribyrnong local government area and its council seat. Footscray recorded a population of 17,131 at the .

Footscray is characterised by a very diverse, multicultural central shopping area, which reflects the successive waves of immigration experienced by Melbourne, and by Footscray in particular. Once a centre for Greek, Italian and former Yugoslavian migrants, it later became a hub for Vietnamese and East African immigrants in Melbourne. It has recently begun to undergo rapid development and gentrification, and &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine placed Footscray at 13th in its &#x27;50 Coolest Neighbourhoods in the World&#x27; for 2019, reflecting its evolving reputation, citing in particular its diverse array of international cuisine, bars and nightlife, as well as its arts scene.

Footscray is named after Foots Cray, on the River Cray in London, England.

==History==

Footscray is part of the City of Maribyrnong and was built largely on the traditional lands of the Kulin nation.

For thousands of years, Footscray was the meeting place of the lands of the Yalukit-willam, the Marin-balluk, and the Wurundjeri people. Koories stalked game, collected food and fished along the river junction, estuaries, swamps, and lagoons. Within Melbourne&#x27;s western region, the Marin-balug and Kurung-jand-balug clans of the Woiwurrung cultural group, and the Yalukit-willam clan of the Boonwurrung cultural group shared the luscious resources around the Maribyrnong Valley.

The first European to visit the area was Charles Grimes in 1803. A park, where he landed, is named after him at Napier St.

In 1839 a punt (cable ferry) was built on the Maribyrnong River, it was the only connecting link between Melbourne and Geelong, Ballarat, Castlemaine and Bendigo. The Punt Hotel opened three years later and was the first building in the area. During the first decade drovers transporting cattle and sheep provided the only business at the hotel. After 1851, when gold was discovered out west, the pub did a roaring trade with diggers. Part of the old pub still stands and it has been renamed The Pioneer.

The Post Office first opened on 12 October 1857.

Footscray was declared a municipality in 1859 with a population of 300 and 70 buildings. Around the same year the first bridge was built across Saltwater (now Maribyrnong) River.

Between 1881 and 1891 Footscray&#x27;s population more than tripled from almost 6,000 to 19,000.

Between around 1916 and 1940, Burn Brae Private Hospital existed on Ballarat Road. Many babies were born there, including actor Leslie Dayman in 1933.

Footscray developed into an industrial zone in the second half of the nineteenth century, with the manufacturing industry beginning to decline in the 1960s and 70s.

The Footscray Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

==People==

Footscray was home to the Aboriginal Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung tribes of the Kulin nation.

In 2011, Footscray&#x27;s 13,193 residents came from 135 countries.

In the , just over half the population (50.9%) was born in Australia, the main countries of overseas origin are Vietnam (8.5%), India (4.7%), England (2.2%), China (2.2%) and New Zealand (2.0%). With increasing gentrification, the number of Anglo-Celtic Australians has steadily increased in Footscray with neighbouring West Footscray seeing an even more drastic shift. In 2021, the Australian-born population had increased to 50.9%, with Vietnam and India as the most prominent places of birth overseas.

As of 2021, the median age of people living in Footscray was 34.

Maribyrnong Council predicts a population boom will more than double Footscray resident numbers from 14,100 to 30,500 by 2031, requiring about 7000 new dwellings.

==Politics==

Footscray is located in the federal electorate of Fraser, which has been represented by Daniel Mulino of the ALP since a redistribution prior to the 2022 Federal Election. 

At the state level, the electorate of Footscray has been held by Labor&#x27;s Katie Hall since 2018. 

Locally, Footscray is part of the City of Maribyrnong, where the council for the 2024–28 term comprises three Greens, three Labor members, and one Independent.

The suburb&#x27;s historical voting patterns have been fairly typical of a working-class suburb with a high migrant population. Footscray was a very safe state Labor seat, 65% of the vote went to Labor at the 2014 State election.

In the 2022 State election, Labor&#x27;s vote dropped significantly, with a 14% swing towards the Greens and Labor&#x27;s primary vote falling to 43%. 

Consistent with other inner-city electorates in Melbourne, and other state capitals, voter support for the Australian Greens has increased in recent years; the Greens received 17 per cent of the primary vote in Footscray at the 2014 State Election. One third of voters at the Central Footscray booth voted for the Australian Greens in the 2010 Federal election, almost doubling the Greens vote in one election cycle.

At the Federal Election of 2010, the ALP won Gellibrand, which includes Footscray, with 59% of the vote. The Lib/Nat parties got 23%, whilst The Greens saw a swing of +6% with 15% of the vote.

Janet Rice of The Greens was elected to Maribyrnong Council in 2003, re-elected in 2005 and then elected mayor in 2006. Whilst Mayor, Janet had a Mayoral bike instead of a car.

The first Vietnamese woman mayor was Mai Ho, from 1997 to 1998. Mai Ho arrived in Australia in December 1982 with two small daughters and sixteen dollars. By 1997 she was Mayor of Maribyrnong. Twelve months later her daughter, Tan Le, was voted Young Australian of the Year.

==Food==

In 2013, there were over 130 restaurants in Footscray, including; 30 Vietnamese, 20 Indian, 17 Chinese and several others featuring Ethiopian, Australian, Indonesian, Italian, Thai, Turkish and Japanese cuisines. 

The Footscray Market is a large indoor fresh produce and seafood market, with 33 food stalls and 50 general stalls, catering particularly to the various ethnicities and local restaurants. It is located opposite Footscray railway station.

The Melbourne Wholesale Market on Footscray Road (often referred to as the Footscray Traders Market) moved to Epping in 2015.

Another large market in Footscray was Little Saigon, which opened in 1992 to cater to Asian population growth, but had customers from all backgrounds. Little Saigon was noisy and crowded, with a wide array of tropical fruits and Asian produce. However, this market was destroyed in a large fire on 13 December 2016, with more than $12 million worth of damage. As of 2021, there are plans to rebuild the market.

==Culture==
Footscray has some fine 1930s Art Deco buildings, most in disrepair and hidden behind shop signs and awnings.

The former Footscray Town Hall is the only American Romanesque civic building in Victoria. The outside is a mix of Art Deco, Moderne, Celtic, Spanish and Medieval.

Footscray Park is one of the largest and most intact examples of an Edwardian park in Australia; characteristic features include rustic stonework, ornamental ponds and extensive use of palms. The 15-hectare park is classified as a heritage place on the Victorian Heritage Register. The &#x27;heavily indebted&#x27; local Council approved a 1.8 million makeover for the park in March 2011. In 2019, Council failed to privatise one third of the park.

==In popular culture==
Footscray has been the setting of several Australian movies.

In 1992, the film &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; was set in and filmed in and around Footscray. It deals with a fictional gang of neo-Nazi skinheads and their battle against Vietnamese immigrants. Not all scenes were filmed locally: the &quot;Footscray Railway Station&quot; featured in the movie has a pedestrian underpass, while the real station has an overpass for foot traffic; the actual station used for filming was Richmond Station.

The 1994 film &quot;Metal Skin&quot; and the 2015 film &quot;Pawno&quot; are also set in and around Footscray.

The song Footscray Station by Melbourne band &quot;Camp Cope&quot; is about Footscray, where the lead singer and guitarist Georgia Maq, originally from Kew, resides.

Australian pop punk outfit Nö Class frequently reference Footscray in their lyrics, such as their 2018 hit Carry Me Home, which centres around the Footscray Hotel.

Melbourne band &quot;The Smith Street Band&quot; recorded the music video for their song &#x27;Shine&#x27; as a homage to that of the music video of Its a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll) by iconic Australian band &quot;AC/DC&quot; in the CBD of Footscray along Barkly Street.

==Groups==

The Footscray Club is a social club that has been part of Footscray since 1894. This was the original &quot;Footscray Cycle Club&quot;, when cycling became quite popular in Australia in the 19th century. By 1909 the club had built a permanent site on Paisley Street where it still stands today. Early in the last century the club evolved into a purely local social club where members of the local community meet and socialise to this day.

The Footscray Historical Society works on a number of local fronts to record and preserve the history of the area. The Society has an active membership who take part in a range of activities to assist this endeavour. Records such as rare books, business records and correspondence are held at the Society&#x27;s headquarters at Ercildoune, built in 1876 as a branch of the National Bank of Australasia. The Society owns this historic building and has had the interior and exterior restored. Tours, forums and discussions are held regularly.

Footscray is at the centre of the Kariwara Scout district of Scouts Australia. The word &#x27;Kariwara&#x27; means &#x27;West&#x27; in a local Aboriginal language. Started in 1909, the 1st Footscray Scout hall is a historic building next to the Footscray Police Station in Hyde Street. 3rd Footscray is the hall seen from the railway line and no longer has youth programs but is home to adult training.

The last Big West Festival was in November 2015. In July 2016 the Big West board announced a plan to destroy Big West. The local arts community then set up the Save Big West group and failed.

==Town planning==

The &#x27;Liveable Melbourne&#x27; 2011 survey listed Footscray as the 37th-most-liveable suburb in Melbourne.

In 2008, the State Labor Government designated Footscray as one of six Central Activities Districts. Melbourne&#x27;s CADs were given planning rules aimed at creating lively mixed use CBD-like districts. The area, according to the local mayor, &#x27;would soon have the second-highest skyline outside the Melbourne CBD&#x27;.

Local Footscray real estate agent Darren Dean of Sweeney Estate Agents said one pocket of Footscray – bounded by Geelong Road, Ballarat Road, Victoria Street, the railway line and Moore Street – had been intended for &quot;a mini Manhattan&quot;.

&quot;There are cranes popping up in the skyline everywhere over here&quot;, he said.

Examples of new real estate developments in Footscray:

*Ovation located at 94–104 Buckley Street, Footscray.
*Liberty One located at 1 Warde Street, Footscray.
*Live City located at 124–188 Ballarat Road, Footscray.
*Eldridge located at 17 Eldridge Street Footscray.

Examples of the changing face of Footscray include:

*In 2014, the Liberal State Planning Minister Matthew Guy approved a 28-story tower that will overshadow the Maribyrnong River in Footscray.
*Nearly 9,000 additional dwellings were built in Footscray between 2006 and 2011.
*Grocon opened the $350 million &#x27;McNab Avenue Development&#x27; with residential apartments, Government and commercial offices in 2014.
*The Banco Group turned the Footscray Plaza into a $45 million apartment block of ten stories, with the old retail space expanded. The property falls within the &quot;Priority Development Zone&quot; so there were no rights to community consultation.
*As part of the Footscray City Edge master plan, Maribyrnong Council planned to turn the Paisley Street carpark into a park.
* In 2012, a $500million high-density residential and commercial development was approved for over the railway tracks near Footscray Station.
*In 2011, the iconic Little Saigon market was approved for a $70 million redevelopment with twin towers, holding 260 apartments and sky gardens.
*The 15-hectare &#x27;Joseph Road Precinct&#x27; was approved for higher-density residential development in 2009. The tallest building approved for the area is a $90 million, 25-story apartment block with 222 apartments, construction is due to finish in 2013.
*A new $6 billion suburb called E-Gate in West Melbourne has been proposed by the state government on a 20-hectare site along Footscray Road.
*The long-abandoned Kinnears rope factory site on Ballarat Road could be turned into a mini-suburb for 2,500 people including high-rise apartments, increasing the number of homes in Footscray by more than a quarter.
*In 2011, $2 million was spent to revamp Leeds Street with wider footpaths, more trees and less access for cars.
*In 2010, as a part of the Victorian Government&#x27;s $61.6 million Footscray renewal program, a new $15 million rail footbridge opened at Footscray railway station; within months, the government announced that half of the bridge would need to be rebuilt to accommodate new platforms for the Regional Rail Link. Ken Betts, local Liberal candidate says, &quot;the railway station is a complete an utter mess&quot;, The canopies on the footbridge have designer holes which allows the rain fall through, leaving the steep steps and flat surface of the bridge covered in slippery water, which ex-Mayor of Maribyrnong, Janet Rice, calls unsafe.
The landscape of Footscray station was upgraded significantly as a result of the Regional Rail Link from 2012 to 2014. Works included:

* 2 new platforms, numbered 1 and 2, for the Sunbury line Metro services. These were completed in January 2014.
* A brand new ticket office and waiting area, located near the bus interchange on Irving St near the new Platform 1. Completed along with Platform 1 &amp; 2 in January 2014.
* The escalators at the Hyde and Irving Street ends were upgraded significantly, with new lifts and shelters added to both and the Irving Street end of the William Cooper Footbridge was extended out to accommodate the new RRL platforms. Four wide ramps were also added looking toward the Nicholson St &amp; McNab Av side of the station, to navigate between the street and the footbridge and the platforms and the footbridge.
* The former Platforms 1, 2, 3 and 4 were renumbered 3, 4, 5 and 6, with 1 &amp; 2 being closed for construction of the new RRL tracks. These were completed in July 2014.
* Extensive restoration of historic buildings was carried out
* A forecourt with plants and sitting areas was built where shops had formerly been on Irving Street, and 2 new kiosks were constructed close to the station entrance. The most famous of these was the Olympic Hot Doughnuts (now closed) kiosk, with an opening day being held on 9 July 2014 and former premier Denis Napthine being in attendance.

All works at Footscray station were complete by November 2014.

Transport issues in Footscray:

*Despite the revamping of Footscray, 1,000s of heavy trucks from nearby ports use the suburbs streets. Almost 3,000 trucks a day were recorded going down Buckley Street in central Footscray in 2010. Greens Mayor Cr Janet Rice helped get heavy trucks banned from Hopkins, Barkley, Irving, and Nicholson Streets in 2007. Truck bypass protesters from the MTAG have blockaded central Footscray roads during peak hour several times, the last blockade was on Moore St, April 2014. Protestors called for night and weekend truck curfews.

<doc id="615336" wikidata="Q2351103" url="?curid=615336" title="KH-6 Lanyard">
<text>BYEMAN codenamed LANYARD, the KH-6 was the unsuccessful first attempt to develop and deploy a very high-resolution optical reconnaissance satellite by the United States National Reconnaissance Office. Launches and launch attempts spanned the period from March to July 1963. The project was quickly put together to get imagery of a site near Leningrad suspected of having anti-ballistic missiles.

The satellite carried Itek&#x27;s &quot;E-5&quot; camera developed for the SAMOS program, which had been cancelled. The camera had a focal length of and could discern objects on the ground in size. The ground swath of the camera was . The satellite weighed , and had a single re-entry vehicle in which exposed film was returned to earth for a mid-air aircraft recovery. 

The KH-6 was manufactured by Lockheed Martin and launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on Thor-Agena D launch vehicles.

== Launches ==
KH-6 8001 was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor-Agena D launch vehicle (Thor 360) at 00:00:00 GMT on 18 March 1963. It was the first of three KH-6 LANYARD launches. This mission was a failure because the Agena guidance system failed.

KH-6 8002 was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor-Agena D rocket (Thor 364) at 22:34:00 GMT on 18 May 1963. This was the second launch KH-6 LANYARD satellite. This spacecraft achieved orbit but the Agena rocket failed in flight and no film data were returned.

KH-6 8003 was launched from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Thor-Agena D rocket (Thor 382) at 00:00:00 GMT on 31 July 1963. This was the third and final KH-6 (LANYARD) mission that was designed to provide very high-resolution photos (61 cm), but the best resolution achieved was 183 cm, the same as KH-4B, so LANYARD was discontinued after this 3rd flight in 1963. The camera failed after 32 hours. The mission was deemed a success but the image quality was poor. The film canister contained over 2,250 feet of film with 910 photographic frames.

<text>Helen Robson Walton(December 3, 1919 – April 19, 2007) was an American philanthropist and prominent arts advocate, dedicated to being a grandmother and to her community in Bentonville, Arkansas where she instituted a committee for a national museum of arts. After 31 years of activity, the Arkansas Committee on the National Museum for Women in the Arts is the longest standing committee in the state. She was also the wife of Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club founder Sam Walton. At one point in her life, she was the richest American and the eleventh-richest woman in the world.

== Biography ==
Helen was born in Claremore, Oklahoma. She was the daughter of homemaker Hazel Carr Robson and a prosperous banker/rancher Leland Stanford (L. S.) Robson. She was the valedictorian of her high school class in Claremore, Oklahoma, and a graduate of the University of Oklahoma at Norman with a degree in finance. She married Sam Walton on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 1943, in Claremore. They had met in a bowling alley where her dad took her. She once said in a TV interview that upon marrying, they agreed to avoid family squabbling at all costs.

In September 1945, Sam and Helen Walton opened a Ben Franklin &quot;five and dime&quot;, their first retail store, in Newport, Arkansas. In 1950, they moved to Bentonville, Arkansas, and in 1962, they opened the first Wal-Mart. Sam Walton credits her for having the idea of the profit-sharing plan with the company&#x27;s associates.

In 1982, Walton established a children&#x27;s enrichment center in Bentonville. The center is now called the Helen R. Walton Children&#x27;s Enrichment Center and has the goal of educating children from 6 weeks old through pre-kindergarten and assisting other child care providers to improve the quality of child care in Arkansas.

When Sam Walton died in 1992, he left his ownership in Wal-Mart to Helen and their four children.

In 2002, as Helen Walton was the president of the Walton Family Foundation, a $300 million donation was made to the University of Arkansas, the biggest donation ever made to a public university in the United States. This donation was preceded by a $50 million donation to the same university&#x27;s School of Business. Helen also established a scholarship program called the “Walton Scholars,” which helps 150 students annually and helped create a program meant to move students from Central America to the U.S. to learn about democracy and free enterprise.

In the last eight years of her life, Helen suffered from dementia but gained peace painting watercolors. &quot;They&#x27;re abstract but just lyrical and beautiful,&quot; said her daughter Alice in an October 2013 interview with &quot;Forbes&quot;. &quot;I have two. One&#x27;s very happy and…oh, whimsical, I guess you would say. Then there&#x27;s one she did right before she died. I mean, you could almost tell. She knew.&quot; She would sometimes in her old age travel to Tennessee, to have lunch with her friend, Annie Kathryn Rives Luck, at the White House Restaurant in the small town of Moscow, Tennessee.

She died of heart failure on April 19, 2007. At the time of her death, she had an estimated net worth of $16.4 billion and owned 8.1% of Wal-Mart. Ms. Walton was survived by her brother, Frank Robson; three children, Samuel Robson Walton, Jim C. Walton, and Alice Louise Walton; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

== Involvement in the Arts ==
In 1987, Helen Walton was the leading support and integral figure in the development of the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The construction was completed in 5 years and the goals of bringing art and artists to the community that would not experience it otherwise and educating young generations could be realized. The Walton Arts Center is one of the most prominent art presenters in the mid-south and one of the few to still perform full-week Broadway productions.

In 1989, Helen Walton, after meeting with Wilhelmina (Billie) Holladay, was inspired to form an Arkansan committee for the National Museum of Women in the Arts or ACNMWA. After discussing their trips to Europe, Walton and Holladay expressed their want to establish a committee that would display the women artists of Arkansas. Texas, Ohio, New York, North Carolina, and Colorado had already held galleries that displayed their women artists by this time. The committee was organized in Little Rock, AR with representatives from 12 demographic districts divided by population; Little Rock was the exception with three representatives. Each representative donated $100 and $2000 was donated by the NMWA to fund an Arkansas Gallery in the NMWA Elisabeth Kasser Wing, the first gallery was exhibited in 1990. Helen was the first acting president of the ACNMWA and from 1990 to 1992 was actively a part of the galleries, what artists would be displayed, who would curate the galleries, the budgets for the events, etc. The committee would prove its dedication to accurately portraying the community, displaying not only the women of Arkansas, but minorities of Arkansas as well. ACNMWA held their first national exhibit in 1992, A Personal Statement: Arkansas Women Artists. In 1991, a museum show was dedicated to children&#x27;s literature, prominently displaying African-American characters and authors. Since Walton&#x27;s departure from the committee, the ACNMWA has established the Artist Award, the College Internship, and an Arkansan women artist registry to further encourage involvement and interest in the arts. The ACNMWA is the only branch of the national committee that does state-wide tours of the national exhibits.

<text>BYEMAN codenamed GAMBIT, the KH-7 (Air Force Program 206) was a reconnaissance satellite used by the United States from July 1963 to June 1967. Like the older CORONA system, it acquired imagery intelligence by taking photographs and returning the undeveloped film to earth. It achieved a typical ground-resolution of to . Though most of the imagery from the KH-7 satellites was declassified in 2002, details of the satellite program (and the satellite&#x27;s construction) remained classified until 2011.

In its summary report following the conclusion of the program, the National Reconnaissance Office concluded that the GAMBIT program was considered highly successful in that it produced the first high-resolution satellite photography, 69.4% of the images having a resolution under ; its record of successful launches, orbits, and recoveries far surpassed the records of earlier systems; and it advanced the state of the art to the point where follow-on larger systems could be developed and flown successfully. The report also stated that Gambit had provided the intelligence community with the first high-resolution satellite photography of denied areas, the intelligence value of which was considered &quot;extremely high&quot;. In particular, its overall success stood in sharp contrast to the two first-generation photoreconnaissance programs, Corona, which suffered far too many malfunctions to achieve any consistent success, and SAMOS, which was essentially a complete failure with all satellites either being lost in launch mishaps or returning no usable imagery.

GAMBIT emerged in 1962 as an alternative to the less-than-successful CORONA and the completely failed SAMOS, although CORONA was not cancelled and in fact continued operating alongside the newer program into the early 1970s. While CORONA used the Thor-Agena launch vehicle family, GAMBIT would be launched on Atlas-Agena, the booster used for SAMOS. After the improved KH-8 GAMBIT-3 satellite was developed during 1965, operations shifted to the larger Titan IIIB launch vehicle.

== System configuration ==

Each GAMBIT-1 satellite was about long, wide, weighed about , and carried about of film.

A feasibility study for the Geodetic Orbital Photographic Satellite System reveals three subsystems for U.S. optical reconnaissance satellites in the 1960s: the Orbital (or Orbiting) Control Vehicle (OCV), the Data Collection Module (DCM), and the Recovery Section (RS). For the KH-7, the DCM is also called the Camera Optics Module (COM), and is integrated in the OCV, which has a length of and a diameter of .

=== Camera Optics Module ===
The Camera Optics Module of KH-7 consists of three cameras: a single strip camera, a stellar camera, and an index camera.

In the strip camera the ground image is reflected by a steerable flat mirror to a diameter stationary concave primary mirror. The primary mirror reflects the light through an opening in the flat mirror and through a Ross corrector. It took images of a 6.3° wide ground swath by exposing a wide moving portion of film through a small slit aperture. The initial ground resolution of the satellite was , but improved to by 1966. Each satellite weighed about , and returned a single film bucket per mission. The camera and film transport system were manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company.

The index camera is a copy of cameras systems previously used in the KH-4 and KH-6 satellites, and takes exposures of Earth in direction of the vehicle roll position for attitude determination. The stellar camera takes images of star fields with a reseau grid being superimposed on the image plane. The S/I camera was provided by Itek, and horizon sensors were provided by Barnes Engineering Co.

=== Orbital Control Vehicle and Recovery Vehicle ===
The primary contractor for the Orbital Control Vehicle and the Recovery Vehicle was General Electric. Films were to be retrieved mid-air by a C-130 Hercules specially outfitted for that purpose.

== Mission ==
All KH-7 satellites were launched from Point Arguello, which became part of Vandenberg Air Force Base in July 1964. KH-7 satellites flew 38 missions, numbered 4001-4038, of which 34 returned film, and of these, 30 returned usable imagery. Mission duration was 1 to 8 days. KH-7 satellites logged a total of almost 170 operational days in orbit.

== Functionality ==
A high-resolution instrument, the KH-7 took detailed pictures of &quot;hot spots&quot; and most of its photographs are of Chinese and Soviet nuclear and missile installations, with smaller amounts of coverage of cities and harbors. Most of the imagery from this camera, amounting to 19,000 images, was declassified in 2002 as a result of Executive order 12951, the same order which declassified CORONA, and copies of the films were transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey&#x27;s Earth Resources Observation Systems office. Approximately 100 frames covering the state of Israel remain classified.

In early 1964, the CIA toyed with the idea of using GAMBIT to photograph military installations in Cuba, but this was dismissed as unworkable as the satellites were primarily designed with higher-latitude Soviet territory in mind and because it would mean wasting an entire satellite on the Latin America-Caribbean area which had little else of interest to U.S. intelligence services. It was decided that U-2 spyplane flights were adequate to provide coverage of Cuban activity.

== ELINT subsatellite ==
Mission 4009 included an ELINT P-11 subsatellite for radar monitoring, which was launched into a higher orbit.

== History ==
:&quot;Section source: Space Review&quot;

GAMBIT marked the first use of next-generation launch vehicle systems as Convair and Lockheed, the builders of the Atlas-Agena booster, began introducing improved, standardized launchers to replace the multitude of customized variants used up to 1963, which caused endless mix ups, poor reliability, and mission failures. This followed a recommendation by the Lewis Spaceflight Center in Cleveland, Ohio that Atlas and Agena switch to one standard configuration for both NASA and Air Force launches, with uniform testing and checkout procedures, as well as improved materials and fabrication processes for the various hardware components in the boosters. The Agena D, a standardized Agena B, arrived first, with the uprated Atlas SLV-3 taking another year to fly. The first eight GAMBIT flown still used custom-modified Atlas D ICBM cores, with GAMBIT 4010 in August 1964 being the first use of the SLV-3. Afterwards, all GAMBIT used SLV-3s aside from 4013, which used the last old-style Atlas remaining in the inventory.

In early 1963, the GAMBIT program began with failures. On 11 May 1963, the first GAMBIT satellite sat atop Atlas-Agena 190D on SLC-4W at Vandenberg Air Force Base awaiting launch. An air bubble formed while loading LOX into the booster and as soon as propellant filling was stopped, the bubble damaged the fill/drain valve. This quickly caused both the LOX and helium pressure gas to escape from the tank, depressurizing the Atlas&#x27;s balloon skin and causing the entire launch vehicle to crumple to the ground. The RP-1 tank ruptured and spilled its contents onto the pad. There was no fire or explosion, but the Agena sustained minor damage and the satellite a considerable amount as the cameras were crushed in by impact with the ground and had their lenses destroyed. The pad itself was undamaged except for a steel beam cracked by exposure to the super-chilled LOX, which was repaired in two days. Fortunately, the satellite on the booster was not the same one planned for the actual launch and the payload shroud had also remained in one piece, preventing any unauthorized parties from seeing the GAMBIT. Secrecy surrounding the program was strict and knowledge of GAMBIT limited only to those directly involved in the program. While the early CORONA and SAMOS flights had been merely billed to the public as scientific missions, it became increasingly difficult to explain why they failed to return any scientific data. In late 1961, President John F. Kennedy ordered a veil of secrecy placed around the photoreconnaissance program and by GAMBIT&#x27;s debut in 1963, DoD announcements described no details other than the launching of a &quot;classified payload&quot;.

The Agena was sent back to Lockheed for repairs and a different Atlas (vehicle 201D) was used, and the first successful GAMBIT mission was launched on 12 July 1963. The launch vehicle performed perfectly and inserted GAMBIT into polar orbit with a altitude. The Air Force designated this mission number 4001.

Aerospace Corporation recommended that, during GAMBIT&#x27;s first flights, the Orbital Control Vehicle (OCV) should remain attached to the Agena. This was a proven successful process for other Agena tests; and whereas the OCV was not. This decision limited GAMBIT&#x27;s functionality, meaning that photographs could only be taken of targets directly below the vehicle. Once the successful photographic phase of the mission 4002 was completed, the OCV and the Agena were separated and the reentry vehicle would come down into the ocean northwest of Hawaii. The re-entry vehicle was caught in mid-air with a C-130 Hercules aircraft using a modified version of the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system. The film canister was then immediately transported to Eastman Kodak&#x27;s &quot;Hawkeye&quot; facility in Rochester, New York for processing. The developed results was sent to US Air Force imagery research analysts in Washington, DC.

GAMBIT mission 4003, was launched on 25 October 1963. The film canister was again ejected successfully after the photographic phase and the capsule recovered by an aircraft. Other tests were carried out with the OCV.

GAMBIT mission 4004 was launched and its film canister recovered on 18 December 1963. Missions 4005 through 4007 were also successful.

In May 1964, mission 4008 suffered major problems when the Agena did an unexplained roll during the boost phase. Even with OCV system problems, the film canister was able to return some imagery.

A variety of problems occurred with many of the remaining missions including poor or no imagery. Many of these difficulties were caused by the unreliable wire recording system carried by the GAMBITs (tape recorders were not yet in widespread use in the mid-1960s). Two satellites ended up in the Pacific Ocean. The first of them was 4012, launched on October 8, 1964. The Agena engine shut down after 1.5 seconds of operation and the GAMBIT did not attain orbit. An investigation of the failure found that an electrical short occurred in an engine relay box, resulting in a cutoff signal being issued 0.4 seconds after ignition. As soon as the engine arming command was stopped at 1.5 seconds, the Agena propulsion system shut down. Examination of factory records for the Agena found that a pair of metal screws from a little-used terminal connector had broken off and disappeared to parts unknown; it was speculated that they landed somewhere as to cause a short. Telemetry data indicated otherwise entirely normal performance of all Agena systems. The other failure was 4020, launched on 12 July 1965 when the Atlas programmer accidentally issued simultaneous SECO and BECO commands, the resultant propulsion system shutdown sending the launch vehicle into the Pacific Ocean some downrange. The latter was the first flight witnessed by newly arrived Brig. Gen John L. Martin who replaced Maj. Gen Robert Greer as head of the KH-7 program. Martin cracked down and began demanding higher workmanship and quality standards. He is credited with having significantly improved the success rate of the program.

It was noted that the GAMBIT flights through the first half of 1964 had been mostly successful, but a string of malfunctions occurred starting in the second half of the year and continuing through the first half of 1965. These included the two above-mentioned launch failures plus GAMBIT 4013 which did not return any imagery and GAMBIT 4014 which suffered a battery explosion. GAMBIT 4019 did not return any imagery either. Eventually, it was determined that the culprit was an extra structure added to the SLC-4W umbilical tower that sent resonant vibration through the Atlas-Agena stack at liftoff, jarring random components in the booster and/or spacecraft loose.

The KH-7 GAMBIT was an overall success, even with some failures; thus providing National Reconnaissance Office and the President with quality intelligence collection. Following KH-7 projects had greatly improved major upgrades in the spacecraft and its camera systems.

== Cost ==
The total cost of the 38 flight KH-7 program from FY1963 to FY1967, without non-recurring costs, and excluding five GAMBIT cameras sold to NASA, was US$651.4 million in 1963 dollars (inflation adjusted US$ billion present day). Non-recurring costs for industrial facilities, development, and one-time support amounted to 24.3% of the total program cost, or US$209.1 million. The resulting total program costs were US$860.5 million in 1963 dollars (inflation adjusted US$ billion present day).

<text>Frank de Jong (born October 16, 1955) is a Canadian politician, environmentalist, and elementary school teacher. He joined the Green Party of Ontario in 1987 and became the party&#x27;s first official leader in 1993 – a position he held until November 14, 2009, when he was succeeded by Mike Schreiner. From 2017 to 2019 he was the leader of the Yukon Green Party. De Jong has also campaigned for federal office as a member of the Green Party of Canada.

==Education and activism==
Born into a Dutch background, De Jong earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1978, and a Bachelor of Education from University of Ottawa in 1979. After graduating, he worked as an elementary school teacher. He developed an interest in environmental concerns during the mid-1980s, and became involved in campaigns to save Ontario&#x27;s old growth forests. He was also involved in the anti-nuclear, renewable energy and pro-choice movements. De Jong now resides in Huntsville, Ontario with his partner Tove Christensen.

==Politics==
The Ontario Green Party did not originally have a formal leadership structure, and was run in a very decentralized manner (nominal leaders were sometimes chosen for elections, but they had no personal authority over party decisions). De Jong and a broad coalition of chapters agreed to a new constitution in 1993. The legwork to facilitate the change was led by Ian Whyte in Ottawa and Jim Harris in Toronto. The actual rewriting of the constitution was led by Ken Toews Policy coordinator who headed up a team to write the new constitution. The changes to the constitution were approved with an 88% majority. There is a direct line between these changes to our constitution and the eventual election of Mike Schreiner to the provincial legislature. A small number of chapters opposed this approach, and successfully campaigned for a formal leadership contest in 1993. De Jong himself entered this contest, and defeated Jim Harris, who later became leader of the Green Party of Canada. De Jong supported Harris&#x27;s leadership of the federal party until Harris stepped down in 2006, at which time de Jong supported David Chernushenko&#x27;s leadership bid. He was challenged for the leadership of the Ontario Green Party by Judy Greenwood-Speers in 2001.

Like Harris, de Jong is an eco-capitalist. He defines his political philosophy as &quot;socially progressive, fiscally conservative, and environmentally aware&quot;. He has long supported conservative economic policies, including a gradual shift from the taxation of incomes to the taxation of natural resources. He has also spoken against extensive government subsidies and funding for crown corporations.

At the October 2005 Green Party of Ontario Annual General Meeting, de Jong narrowly avoided a &quot;leadership review&quot; when 67% of voting members voted against it. The GPO constitution requires that a leadership review be held bi-annually; If more than one-third of voting members had opted for a review, a leadership race would have been held in 2006. At the 2007 AGM, de Jong survived the next scheduled review, this time with approximately 71% support from party members. This followed what was considered the strongest election performance by the GPO to date. Speaking at the Green Party of Ontario AGM in May 2009, de Jong announced that he would not be running for re-election as leader of the party.

In the September 14, 2006, Parkdale–High Park by-election, de Jong received 6.2 percent of the vote. On November 7, 2006, he was nominated as the GPO candidate in the riding of Davenport for the 2007 Ontario general election. In that election, de Jong captured 10.26 percent of the vote, his best showing as a member of the Green Party.

De Jong was a candidate for Ward 18 in Toronto&#x27;s 2010 municipal election.

As of December 2014, de Jong was living in Faro, Yukon and was the Green Party of Canada candidate in the Yukon riding in the 2015 federal election, placing a distant fourth.

De Jong was elected leader of the Yukon Green Party in September 2016. He resigned as leader in 2019.

==Election campaigns==

De Jong has campaigned for federal and provincial office several times. His best showing was in the provincial election of 2003, when he ran against sitting Premier Ernie Eves and finished third, ahead of the New Democratic Party candidate. On all other occasions, de Jong has finished well behind candidates of the major parties.

During the 1995 provincial campaign, de Jong cycled on a &quot;leader&#x27;s tour&quot; from Ottawa to Sault Ste. Marie, Windsor and Niagara Falls before returning northward to Ottawa. Subsequently, he was involved in creating constituency contact lists throughout the province.

His electoral record is as follows:

Concrete houses built in the late 1940s to house the families of returned servicemen from World War II are also found. From the early 1990s many old factory sites in Maidstone have been turned into new housing estates comprising hundreds of houses and townhouses. Maidstone&#x27;s recent development boost, good public transport availability and close proximity to the CBD has also seen the median house price escalate dramatically over the past 10 years.

<doc id="615347" wikidata="Q6342297" url="?curid=615347" title="KZEP-FM">
<text>KZEP-FM (104.5 FM, &quot;104.5 Latino Hits&quot;) is an commercial Spanish CHR American radio station broadcasting in and around San Antonio, Texas, United States. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, (formerly Clear Channel Communications). Its studios are located in the Stone Oak neighborhood in Far North San Antonio, and the transmitter site is atop Tower of the Americas downtown.

KZEP was formerly owned by Lotus Communications until May 2008.

==History==
===Early days===
KZEP signed on as KITE-FM on 104.5 MHz with a &quot;beautiful music&quot; format in 1966. Toward the end of the 1960s, KITE-FM began experimenting with a multi-formatted station, i.e., beautiful music during the day and album rock after 11 pm. The underground rock segment was known as &quot;Now Sounds&quot;. The Album Underground Rock format began after the classical music segment. Disc jockey Alan Grimm broadcast a different length show every night, sometimes until 6 AM. Underground rock artists included: It&#x27;s A Beautiful Day, Bubble Puppy, The 13th Floor Elevators, Procol Harum, Ten Years After, Jefferson Airplane, Savoy Brown, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Love, Pink Floyd, Josefus, etc. KITE-FM evolved into a full-time rocker as KEXL in the 1970s. From 1979 to 1983, the call letters changed to KVAR-FM, and broadcast Spanish Language programming. In 1982, the format changed from Beautiful Music Spanish to being the first Tejano FM in San Antonio.

KXZL - The Best Rock

In 1983, the station adopted the new call letters KXZL and channeled the spirit of then legendary rock station KXEL. The station had the fortuitous timing to come on the air at the same time cable video channel MTV was making inroads in San Antonio. San Antonio was one of the first markets to air the channel, and KXZL was the first station to play many of MTV&#x27;s core artist on the radio. It rocketed to number #1 in San Antonio in its first ratings book.

KXZL had a short but brilliant life at 104.5. It lasted only three years mainly due to a shift in programming strategy. As MTV started playing more pop music and less Album Oriented Rock, KXZL went the opposite direction and started playing harder rock. Musically KXZL tried to challenge legendary hard rock station 99.5 KISS and alienated their core audience. Many drifted off to CHR stations like KTFM, who were now more sonically inline with MTV. By 1986, the stations ratings had fallen dramatically and Lotus Broadcasting decided to rebrand the station.

The Original KXZL jocks that debuted with the station when it signed on in Late Feb 1983 are below. In Less than two Arbitron books, the Gary Burns consulted re-booted rocker modeling after original KEXL calls unseated and replaced #1 Rocker KISS on top the ratings report for S.A. With market success of the new KXZL, three members of the original staff were hired away by Baby Lee Roy Hanson to join album rocker KSJO/San Jose in 1984. A number of changes and lack of investment in the product caused ratings to fluctuate before more changes came by 1986.

===K-ZEP 104(.5)===
In 1986, the station dropped the KXZL call letters for KZEP-FM, using the short lived slogan Quality Rock. Shortly after rebranding, KZEP shifted to classic rock, which was a relatively new format at the time. KZEP&#x27;s call letters are a reflection of the music that 104.5 was known for during the majority of its life, as Led Zeppelin was one of the station&#x27;s core artists during its entirety of airing rock music. KZEP faced competition from several stations over its lifetime, including KISS, KMFR and KTKX. Despite being one of as many as four different rock-oriented stations in San Antonio, KZEP maintained a strong presence in the ratings, leading to a nearly three decade tenure as &quot;San Antonio&#x27;s Classic Rock Station&quot;.

On May 15, 2008, Lotus Communications announced that they would swap KZEP to Clear Channel Communications in exchange for Clear Channel&#x27;s KWID in Las Vegas and KBKO in Bakersfield, California. KZEP was Lotus&#x27; only property in the San Antonio market, while they had larger clusters in the latter markets. The swap was completed on July 29, 2008.

===K-ZEP Gets &quot;Hot&quot;; Rock Moves to 93.3===
On August 8, 2014, at noon, KZEP&#x27;s classic rock format moved to FM translator 93.3 K227BH and 104.5 KZEP&#x27;s HD2 channel, as KZEP-FM&#x27;s main signal flipped to a classic-leaning rhythmic CHR format known as &quot;Hot 104.5&quot;. Clear Channel referred to the classic rock format as KZEP-HD and on-air promotions still used the name KZEP.

The flip had been expected to give rival KBBT a serious competitor, as they have dominated the San Antonio Nielsen Audio ratings since its 2000 sign on, which has seen the last four Rhythmic competitors who have tried to take KBBT out within the past decade come and go.

On June 24, 2015, K227BH switched to a simulcast of KZEP&#x27;s HD3 subchannel (a simulcast of classic country-formatted KRPT (&quot;K-Buc Country&quot;), ending KZEP&#x27;s nearly 30-year run with classic rock over the air in San Antonio.

===Latino Hits===
On April 19, 2017, at 5:30pm, KZEP changed their format to Spanish CHR, branded as &quot;104.5 Latino Hits&quot;. The final song on &quot;Hot&quot; was &quot;What Goes Around...Comes Around&quot; by Justin Timberlake, while the first song on &quot;Latino Hits&quot; was &quot;Chantaje&quot; by Shakira.

==KZEP-HD2 programming==
KZEP-HD2 currently airs the classic rock format formerly broadcast on both 93.3 and the main signal of KZEP before that. The KZEP-HD2 classic rock format also continues to broadcast online at the website.

<text>John J. &quot;J. J.&quot; Jackson Jr. (April 8, 1941 – March 17, 2004) was an American radio and television personality. He was one of MTV&#x27;s five original VJs (along with Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter, and Martha Quinn). In his appearances on MTV, Jackson often went by and introduced himself as &quot;Triple J.&quot;

==Career==
Jackson first gained prominence while working at WBCN in Boston in the late 1960s, then at KLOS in Los Angeles for ten years. Jackson was one of the first DJs to introduce Americans to The Who and Led Zeppelin. In 1976, he was featured in a voice-only performance as a DJ of the fictional KGYS radio in the movie &quot;Car Wash&quot;. He was a music reporter for KABC-TV when he was tapped as one of MTV&#x27;s original &quot;fab five.&quot; As a VJ, Jackson hosted the long-awaited and much anticipated &quot;unmasking&quot; of KISS. He was one of the few African Americans to DJ an &quot;album rock&quot; radio station.

After five years at MTV, Jackson returned to Los Angeles radio, JJ&#x27;s first gig after MTV was 106 KWST then at KROQ-FM in 1987, then as program director of modern rock/alternative station KEDG (&quot;The Edge&quot;) until May 1989. He later returned to KLOS, and hosted the afternoon shift at smooth jazz station KTWV (&quot;The Wave&quot;) for one year. He also hosted Westwood One Radio Network&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show &quot;The Beatle Years&quot; from 1995 until his death.

==Death==
On March 17, 2004, Jackson, 62, suffered a heart attack and died while driving home after dining with a friend in Los Angeles. Jackson had a daughter and three grandchildren.

<doc id="615353" wikidata="Q2352628" url="?curid=615353" title="KH-8 Gambit 3">
<text>The KH-8 (BYEMAN codename Gambit-3) was a long-lived series of reconnaissance satellites of the &quot;Key Hole&quot; (KH) series used by the United States from July 1966 to April 1984, and also known as Low Altitude Surveillance Platform. The satellite ejected &quot;film-bucket&quot; canisters of photographic film that were retrieved as they descended through the atmosphere by parachute. Ground resolution of the mature satellite system was better than . There were 54 launch attempts of the 3,000 kilogram satellites, all from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on variants of the Titan III rocket. Three launches failed to achieve orbit. The first one was satellite #5 on April 26, 1967, which fell into the Pacific Ocean after the Titan second stage developed low thrust. The second was satellite #35 on May 20, 1972, which suffered an Agena pneumatic regulator failure and reentered the atmosphere. A few months later, pieces of the satellite turned up in England and the US managed to arrange for their hasty return. The third failure was satellite #39 on June 26, 1973, which suffered a stuck Agena fuel valve. The Bell 8096 engine failed to start and the satellite burned up in the atmosphere. The KH-8 was manufactured by Lockheed. The camera system/satellite was manufactured by Eastman Kodak&#x27;s A&amp;O Division in Rochester, New York.

The Gambit codename was also used by the satellite&#x27;s predecessor, the KH-7 Gambit.

Gambit 3 satellites were the same width as the Gambit 1 models, but also slightly longer – reaching about in length. They carried of film and were designed for longer missions of up to 31 days.

While Gambit was primarily designed and operated as a surveillance satellite, capturing high definition images of specific targets at low orbital altitudes, a single Gambit Block 3 mission was operated in &#x27;dual-mode&#x27;, orbiting first at a higher altitude to capture wide-area search imagery before lowering its perigee to capture normal surveillance imagery. The first film return capsule failed to separate correctly due to a new pyro mechanism failing to perform correctly. The contingency release mechanism separated the film bucket and parachute from its return capsule, and left the film bucket stranded in orbit. In September 2002, the film bucket re-entered over the South Atlantic into deep water. As the film bucket lacked its protective heatshield or the parachute needed to slow its descent, no attempt was made to recover it.

==Camera Optics Module==
The Camera Optics Module of KH-8 consists of four cameras.

The main camera of KH-8B (introduced in 1971) with a focal length of is a single strip camera, designed to gather high-resolution images of ground targets. In the strip camera the ground image is reflected by a steerable flat mirror to a diameter stationary concave primary mirror. The primary mirror reflects the light through an opening in the flat mirror and through a Ross corrector. At periapsis altitude of , the main camera imaged a 6.3 km wide ground swath on a wide moving portion of film through a small slit aperture, resulting in an image scale of 28 meter / millimeter. The Astro-Position Terrain Camera (APTC) contains three cameras: a 75mm focal length terrain frame camera, and two 90mm focal length stellar cameras. The terrain frame camera takes exposures of Earth in direction of the vehicle roll position for attitude determination. The stellar cameras observed in 180 degree opposite directions and took images of star fields.
The films used by GAMBIT were provided by Eastman Kodak, and evolved through a series of successively higher definition films, starting with Type 3404 with a resolving power of 50 to 100 line pairs per mm. Subsequent films used were Type 1414 high-definition film, SO-217 high-definition fine-grain film, and a series of films with silver-halide crystals of very uniform size and shape. The size of silver-halide crystals decreased from 1,550 angstrom in film Type SO-315, to 1,200 angstrom in SO-312, and ultimately to 900 angstrom in SO-409. Under optimal conditions GAMBIT would thus have been able to record ground features as small as using the Eastman Kodak Type 3404 film. Using a film with a resolving power equivalent to the Kodak&#x27;s Type 3409 film of 320 to 630 line pairs per mm, GAMBIT would have been able to record ground features as small as 5 cm to 10 cm (2&quot; to 4&quot;). The initial September 2011 release of &quot;The Gambit Story&quot; quotes &quot;The mature system produced examples of imagery better than four inches ground-resolution distance&quot;. This number was again redacted in a later release. Five to ten centimeters corresponds to the resolution limit imposed by atmospheric turbulence as derived by Fried and, independently, Evvard in the mid-1960s; remarkably, GAMBIT had reached a physical limit on resolution only a few years after the US launched its first reconnaissance satellite. GAMBIT was also able to record objects in orbit. The capability was developed to photograph Soviet spacecraft, but was first used to aid NASA engineers designing repairs for the damaged Skylab space station in 1973.

==Missions==



==Notable Missions==
In May 1973 Gambit KH8-38 was used to observe the crippled Skylab space station, as part of the preparation for repairing it by the Skylab 2 mission.

==Cost==
The total cost of the 54 flight KH-8 program from FY1964 to FY1985, without non-recurring costs, was US$2.3 billion in respective year dollars.

<text>The bombe () was an electro-mechanical device used by British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from Polish and British bombes.

The British bombe was developed from a device known as the &quot;bomba&quot; (), which had been designed in Poland at the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau) by cryptologist Marian Rejewski, who had been breaking German Enigma messages for the previous seven years, using it and earlier machines. The initial design of the British bombe was produced in 1939 at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman. The engineering design and construction was the work of Harold Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. The first bombe, code-named &quot;Victory&quot;, was installed in March 1940 while the second version, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; or &quot;Agnes&quot;, incorporating Welchman&#x27;s new design, was working by August 1940. 

The bombe was designed to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks: specifically, the set of rotors in use and their positions in the machine; the rotor core start positions for the message—the message key—and one of the wirings of the plugboard.

==The Enigma machine==

The Enigma is an electro-mechanical rotor machine used for the encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implement a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turns plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma&#x27;s scrambler contains rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverts the current to a different position on the two sides. When a key is pressed on the keyboard, an electric current flows through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turns it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to illuminate one of the lamps on the lampboard.

At each key depression, the right-hand or &quot;fast&quot; rotor advances one position, which causes the encipherment to change. In addition, once per rotation, the right-hand rotor causes the middle rotor to advance; the middle rotor similarly causes the left-hand (or &quot;slow&quot;) rotor to advance. Each rotor&#x27;s position is indicated by a letter of the alphabet showing through a window. The Enigma operator rotates the wheels by hand to set the start position for enciphering or deciphering a message. The three-letter sequence indicating the start position of the rotors is the &quot;message key&quot;. There are 263 17,576 different message keys and different positions of the set of three rotors. By opening the lid of the machine and releasing a compression bar, the set of three rotors on their spindle can be removed from the machine and their sequence (called the &quot;wheel order&quot; at Bletchley Park) altered. Multiplying 17,576 by the six possible wheel orders gives 105,456 different ways that the scrambler can be set up.

Although 105,456 is a large number, it does not guarantee security. A brute-force attack is possible: one could imagine using 100 code clerks who each tried to decode a message using 1000 distinct rotor settings. The Poles developed card catalogs so they could easily find rotor positions; Britain built &quot;codice_1&quot; (the German word for one) catalogs. Less intensive methods were also possible. If all message traffic for a day used the same rotor starting position, then frequency analysis for each position could recover the polyalphabetic substitutions. If different rotor starting positions were used, then overlapping portions of a message could be found using the index of coincidence. Many major powers (including the Germans) could break Enigma traffic if they knew the rotor wiring. The German military knew the Enigma was weak.

In 1930, the German army introduced an additional security feature, a plugboard (&quot;Steckerbrett&quot; in German; each plug is a &quot;Stecker&quot;, and the British cryptologists also used the word) that further scrambled the letters, both before and after they passed through the rotor-reflector system. The Enigma encryption is a self-inverse function, meaning that it substitutes letters reciprocally: if codice_2 is transformed into codice_3, then codice_3 is transformed into codice_2. The plugboard transformation maintained the self-inverse quality, but the plugboard wiring, unlike the rotor positions, does not change during the encryption. This regularity was exploited by Welchman&#x27;s &quot;diagonal board&quot; enhancement to the bombe, which vastly increased its efficiency. With six plug leads in use (leaving 14 letters &quot;unsteckered&quot;), there were 100,391,791,500 possible ways of setting up the plugboard.

An important feature of the machine from a cryptanalyst&#x27;s point of view, and indeed Enigma&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel, was that the reflector in the scrambler prevented a letter from being enciphered as itself. Any putative solution that gave, for any location, the same letter in the proposed plaintext and the ciphertext could therefore be eliminated.

In the lead-up to World War II, the Germans made successive improvements to their military Enigma machines. By January 1939, additional rotors had been introduced so that three rotors were chosen from a set of five (hence there were now 60 possible wheel orders) for the army and air force Enigmas, and three out of eight (making 336 possible wheel orders) for the navy machines. In addition, ten leads were used on the plugboard, leaving only six letters unsteckered. This meant that the air force and army Enigmas could be set up in 1.5×1019 ways. In 1941 the German navy introduced a version of Enigma with a rotatable reflector (the M4 or Four-rotor Enigma) for communicating with its U-boats. This could be set up in 1.8×1020 different ways.

===Four-rotor Enigma===
By late 1941 a change in German Navy fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic, combined with intelligence reports, convinced Admiral Karl Dönitz that the Allies were able to read the German Navy&#x27;s coded communications, and a fourth rotor with unknown wiring was added to German Navy Enigmas used for U-boat communications, producing the &quot;Triton&quot; system, known at Bletchley Park as &quot;Shark&quot;. This was coupled with a thinner reflector design to make room for the extra rotor. The Triton was designed in such a way that it remained compatible with three-rotor machines when necessary: one of the extra &#x27;fourth&#x27; rotors, the &#x27;beta&#x27;, was designed so that when it was paired with the thin &#x27;B&#x27; reflector, and the rotor and ring were set to &#x27;A&#x27;, the pair acted as a &#x27;B&#x27; reflector coupled with three rotors. Fortunately for the Allies, in December 1941, before the machine went into official service, a submarine accidentally sent a message with the fourth rotor in the wrong position, and then retransmitted the message with the rotor in the correct position to emulate the three-rotor machine. In February 1942 the change in the number of rotors used became official, and the Allies&#x27; ability to read German submarines&#x27; messages ceased until a snatch from a captured U-boat revealed not only the four-rotor machine&#x27;s ability to emulate a three-rotor machine, but also that the fourth rotor did not move during a message. This along with the aforementioned retransmission eventually allowed the code breakers to figure out the wiring of both the &#x27;beta&#x27; and &#x27;gamma&#x27; fourth rotors.

The first half of 1942 was the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot; for the German U-boats, with renewed success in attacking Allied shipping, as the US had just entered war unprepared for the onslaught, lacking in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, ships, personnel, doctrine and organization. Also, the security of the new Enigma and the Germans&#x27; ability to read Allied convoy messages sent in Naval Cipher No. 3 contributed to their success. Between January and March 1942, German submarines sank 216 ships off the US east coast. In May 1942 the US began using the convoy system and requiring a blackout of coastal cities so that ships would not be silhouetted against their lights, but this yielded only slightly improved security for Allied shipping. The Allies&#x27; failure to change their cipher for three months, together with the fact that Allied messages never contained any raw Enigma decrypts (or even mentioned that they were decrypting messages), helped convince the Germans that their messages were secure. Conversely, the Allies learned that the Germans had broken the naval cipher almost immediately from Enigma decrypts, but lost many ships due to the delay in changing the cipher.

==The principle of the bombe==

The following settings of the Enigma machine must be discovered to decipher German military Enigma messages. Once these are known, all the messages for that network for that day (or pair of days in the case of the German navy) could be decrypted.

Internal settings (that required the lid of the Enigma machine to be opened)
* The selection of rotors in use in the Enigma&#x27;s scrambler, and their positions on the spindle (&quot;Walzenlage&quot; or &quot;wheel order&quot;). Possible wheel orders numbered 60 (three rotors from a choice of five) for army and air force networks and 336 (three rotors from a choice of eight) for the naval networks.
* The positions of the alphabet rings&#x27; turnover notch in relation to the core of each rotor in use (&quot;Ringstellung&quot; or &quot;ring settings&quot;). There are 26 possible ring settings for each rotor.

External settings (that could be changed without opening the Enigma machine)
* The plugboard connections (&quot;Steckerverbindungen&quot; or &quot;stecker values&quot;). The ten leads could be arranged in formula_1 different combinations (approximately 151 trillion). 
* The scrambler rotor positions at the start of enciphering the message key (the &quot;Grundstellung&quot; or &quot;indicator-setting&quot;) — up to May 1940; or thereafter the initial positions of each rotor at the start of enciphering the message (the &quot;message key&quot;) from which the indicator-setting could be derived. There are possible three-letter keys.
The bombe identified possible initial positions of the rotor cores and the &quot;stecker partner&quot; of a specified letter for a set of wheel orders. Manual techniques were then used to complete the decryption process. In the words of Gordon Welchman, &quot;... the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of wheel order and scrambler positions that required &#x27;further analysis&#x27; to a manageable number&quot;.

===Structure===


The bombe was an electro-mechanical device that replicated the action of several Enigma machines wired together. A standard German Enigma employed, at any one time, a set of three rotors, each of which could be set in any of 26 positions. The standard British bombe contained 36 Enigma equivalents, each with three drums wired to produce the same scrambling effect as the Enigma rotors. A bombe could run two or three jobs simultaneously.
Each job would have a &#x27;menu&#x27; that had to be run against a number of different wheel orders. If the menu contained 12 or fewer letters, three different wheel orders could be run on one bombe; if more than 12 letters, only two.

In order to simulate Enigma rotors, each rotor drum of the bombe had two complete sets of contacts, one for input towards the reflector and the other for output from the reflector, so that the reflected signal could pass back through a separate set of contacts. Each drum had 104 wire brushes, which made contact with the plate onto which they were loaded. The brushes and the corresponding set of contacts on the plate were arranged in four concentric circles of 26. The outer pair of circles (input and output) were equivalent to the current in an Enigma passing in one direction through the scrambler, and the inner pair equivalent to the current flowing in the opposite direction.

The interconnections within the drums between the two sets of input and output contacts were both identical to those of the relevant Enigma rotor. There was permanent wiring between the inner two sets of contacts of the three input/output plates. From there, the circuit continued to a plugboard located on the left-hand end panel, which was wired to imitate an Enigma reflector and then back through the outer pair of contacts. At each end of the &quot;double-ended Enigma&quot;, there were sockets on the back of the machine, into which 26-way cables could be plugged.

The bombe drums were arranged with the top one of the three simulating the left-hand rotor of the Enigma scrambler, the middle one the middle rotor, and the bottom one the right-hand rotor. The top drums were all driven in synchrony by an electric motor. For each full rotation of the top drums, the middle drums were incremented by one position, and likewise for the middle and bottom drums, giving the total of 26 × 26 × 26 = positions of the 3-rotor Enigma scrambler.

The drums were colour-coded according to which Enigma rotor they emulated: I red; II maroon; III green; IV yellow; V brown; VI cobalt (blue); VII jet (black); VIII silver.

At each position of the rotors, an electric current would or would not flow in each of the 26 wires, and this would be tested in the bombe&#x27;s comparator unit. For a large number of positions, the test would lead to a logical contradiction, ruling out that setting. If the test did not lead to a contradiction, the machine would stop.

The operator would then find the point at which the test passed, record the candidate solution by reading the positions of the indicator drums and the indicator unit on the Bombe&#x27;s right-hand end panel. The operator then restarted the run. The candidate solutions, &quot;stops&quot; as they were called, were processed further to eliminate as many false stops as possible. Typically, there were many false bombe stops before the correct one was found.

The candidate solutions for the set of wheel orders were subject to extensive further cryptanalytical work. This progressively eliminated the false stops, built up the set of plugboard connections and established the positions of the rotor alphabet rings. Eventually, the result would be tested on a Typex machine that had been modified to replicate an Enigma, to see whether that decryption produced German language.

===Bombe menu===
A bombe run involved a cryptanalyst first obtaining a &quot;crib&quot; — a section of plaintext that was thought to correspond to the ciphertext. Finding cribs was not at all straightforward; it required considerable familiarity with German military jargon and the communication habits of the operators. However, the codebreakers were aided by the fact that the Enigma would never encrypt a letter to itself. This helped in testing a possible crib against the ciphertext, as it could rule out a number of cribs and positions, where the same letter occurred in the same position in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. This was termed a &quot;crash&quot; at Bletchley Park.

Once a suitable crib had been decided upon, the cryptanalyst would produce a &quot;menu&quot; for wiring up the bombe to test the crib against the ciphertext. The following is a simplified explanation of the process of constructing a menu. Suppose that the crib is ATTACKATDAWN to be tested against a certain stretch of ciphertext, say, WSNPNLKLSTCS. The letters of the crib and the ciphertext were compared to establish pairings between the ciphertext and the crib plaintext. These were then graphed as in the diagram. It should be borne in mind that the relationships are reciprocal so that A in the plaintext associated with W in the ciphertext is the same as W in the plaintext associated with A in the ciphertext. At position 1 of the plaintext-ciphertext comparison, the letter A is associated with W, but A is also associated with P at position 4, K at position 7 and T at position 10. Building up these relationships into such a diagram provided the menu from which the bombe connections and drum start positions would be set up. 
In the illustration, there are three sequences of letters which form loops (or &quot;cycles&quot; or &quot;closures&quot;), ATLK, TNS and TAWCN. The more loops in the menu, the more candidate rotor settings the bombe could reject, and hence the fewer false stops.

Alan Turing conducted a very substantial analysis (without any electronic aids) to estimate how many bombe stops would be expected according to the number of letters in the menu and the number of loops. Some of his results are given in the following table. Recent bombe simulations have shown similar results.

===Stecker values===

The German military Enigma included a plugboard (&quot;Steckerbrett&quot; in German) which swapped letters (indicated here by ) before and after the main scrambler&#x27;s change (indicated by ). The plugboard connections were known to the cryptanalysts as Stecker values. If there had been no plugboard, it would have been relatively straightforward to test a rotor setting; a Typex machine modified to replicate Enigma could be set up and the crib letter encrypted on it, and compared with the ciphertext, . If they matched, the next letter would be tried, checking that encrypted to and so on for the entire length of the crib. If at any point the letters failed to match, the initial rotor setting would be rejected; most incorrect settings would be ruled out after testing just two letters. This test could be readily mechanised and applied to all settings of the rotors.

However, with the plugboard, it was much harder to perform trial encryptions because it was unknown what the crib and ciphertext letters were transformed to by the plugboard. For example, in the first position, and were unknown because the plugboard settings were unknown.

Turing&#x27;s solution to working out the stecker values (plugboard connections) was to note that, even though the values for, say, or , were unknown, the crib still provided known relationships amongst these values; that is, the values after the plugboard transformation. Using these relationships, a cryptanalyst could reason from one to another and, potentially, derive a logical contradiction, in which case the rotor setting under consideration could be ruled out.

A worked example of such reasoning might go as follows: a cryptanalyst might suppose that . Looking at position 10 of the crib:ciphertext comparison, we observe that encrypts to , or, expressed as a formula:

Due to the function being its own inverse, we can apply it to both sides of the equation and obtain the following:

This gives us a relationship between and . If = , and for the rotor setting under consideration = (say), we can deduce that

While the crib does not allow us to determine what the values after the plugboard are, it does provide a constraint between them. In this case, it shows how is completely determined if is known.

Likewise, we can also observe that encrypts to at position 8. Using , we can deduce the steckered value for as well using a similar argument, to get, say,

Similarly, in position 6, encrypts to . As the Enigma machine is self-reciprocal, this means that at the same position would also encrypt to . Knowing this, we can apply the argument once more to deduce a value for , which might be:

And again, the same sort of reasoning applies at position 7 to get:

However, in this case, we have derived a contradiction, since, by hypothesis, we assumed that = at the outset. This means that the initial assumption must have been incorrect, and so that (for this rotor setting) ≠ (this type of argument is termed &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; or &quot;proof by contradiction&quot;).

The cryptanalyst hypothesised one plugboard interconnection for the bombe to test. The other stecker values and the ring settings were worked out by hand methods.

===Automated deduction===
To automate these logical deductions, the bombe took the form of an electrical circuit. Current flowed around the circuit near-instantaneously, and represented all the possible logical deductions which could be made at that position. To form this circuit, the bombe used several sets of Enigma rotor stacks wired up together according to the instructions given on a menu, derived from a crib. Because each Enigma machine had 26 inputs and outputs, the replica Enigma stacks are connected to each other using 26-way cables. In addition, each Enigma stack rotor setting is offset a number of places as determined by its position in the crib; for example, an Enigma stack corresponding to the fifth letter in the crib would be four places further on than that corresponding to the first letter.
===In practice===
Practical bombes used several stacks of rotors spinning together to test multiple hypotheses about possible setups of the Enigma machine, such as the order of the rotors in the stack.

While Turing&#x27;s bombe worked in theory, it required impractically long cribs to rule out sufficiently large numbers of settings. Gordon Welchman came up with a way of using the symmetry of the Enigma stecker to increase the power of the bombe. His suggestion was an attachment called the &quot;diagonal board&quot; that further improved the bombe&#x27;s effectiveness.

==The British Bombe==
The Polish cryptologic &quot;bomba&quot; (Polish: &quot;bomba kryptologiczna&quot;; plural &quot;bomby&quot;) had been useful only as long as three conditions were met. First, the form of the indicator had to include the repetition of the message key; second, the number of rotors available had to be limited to three, giving six different &quot;wheel orders&quot; (the three rotors and their order within the machine); and third, the number of plug-board leads had to remain relatively small so that the majority of letters were &quot;unsteckered&quot;. Six machines were built, one for each possible rotor order. The &quot;bomby&quot; were delivered in November 1938, but barely a month later the Germans introduced two additional rotors for loading into the Enigma scrambler, increasing the number of wheel orders by a factor of ten. Building another 54 &quot;bomby&quot; was beyond the Poles&#x27; resources. Also, on 1 January 1939, the number of plug-board leads was increased to ten. The Poles therefore had to return to manual methods, the Zygalski sheets.

Alan Turing designed the British bombe on a more general principle, the assumption of the presence of text, called a &quot;crib&quot;, that cryptanalysts could predict was likely to be present at a defined point in the message. This technique is termed a &quot;known plaintext attack&quot; and had been used to a limited extent by the Poles, e.g., the Germans&#x27; use of &quot;ANX&quot; — &quot;AN&quot;, German for &quot;To&quot;, followed by &quot;X&quot; as a spacer.

A £100,000 budget for the construction of Turing&#x27;s machine was acquired and the contract to build the bombes was awarded to the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) at Letchworth. BTM placed the project under the direction of Harold &#x27;Doc&#x27; Keen. Each machine was about wide, tall, deep and weighed about a ton. On the front of each bombe were 108 places where drums could be mounted. The drums were in three groups of 12 triplets. Each triplet, arranged vertically, corresponded to the three rotors of an Enigma scrambler. The bombe drums&#x27; input and output contacts went to cable connectors, allowing the bombe to be wired up according to the menu. The &#x27;fast&#x27; drum rotated at a speed of 50.4 rpm in the first models and 120 rpm in later ones, when the time to set up and run through all 17,576 possible positions for one rotor order was about 20 minutes.

The first bombe was named &quot;Victory&quot;. It was installed in &quot;Hut 1&quot; at Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. It was based on Turing&#x27;s original design and so lacked a diagonal board. On 26 April 1940, captured a German trawler (&quot;Schiff 26&quot;, the &quot;Polares&quot;) flying a Dutch flag; included in the capture were some Enigma keys for 23 to 26 April. Bletchley retrospectively attacked some messages sent during this period using the captured material and an ingenious Bombe menu where the Enigma fast rotors were all in the same position. In May and June 1940, Bletchley succeeded in breaking six days of naval traffic, 22–27 April 1940. Those messages were the first breaks of &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; messages of the war, &quot;[b]ut though this success expanded Naval Section&#x27;s knowledge of the Kriegsmarines&#x27;s signals organization, it neither affected naval operations nor made further naval Enigma solutions possible.&quot; The second bombe, named &quot;Agnus dei&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Agnes&quot;, or &quot;Aggie&quot;, was equipped with Welchman&#x27;s diagonal board, and was installed on 8 August 1940; &quot;Victory&quot; was later returned to Letchworth to have a diagonal board fitted. The bombes were later moved from &quot;Hut 1&quot; to &quot;Hut 11&quot;. The bombe was referred to by Group Captain Winterbotham as a &quot;Bronze Goddess&quot; because of its colour. The devices were more prosaically described by operators as being &quot;like great big metal bookcases&quot;.

During 1940, 178 messages were broken on the two machines, nearly all successfully. Because of the danger of bombes at Bletchley Park being lost if there were to be a bombing raid, bombe outstations were established, at Adstock, Gayhurst and Wavendon, all in Buckinghamshire. In June–August 1941 there were 4 to 6 bombes at Bletchley Park, and when Wavendon was completed, Bletchley, Adstock and Wavenden had a total of 24 to 30 bombes. When Gayhurst became operational there were a total of 40 to 46 bombes, and it was expected that the total would increase to about 70 bombes run by some 700 Wrens (Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service). But in 1942 with the introduction of the naval four-rotor Enigma, &quot;far more than seventy bombes&quot; would be needed. New outstations were established at Stanmore and Eastcote, and the Wavendon and Adstock bombes were moved to them, though the Gayhurst site was retained. The few bombes left at Bletchley Park were used for demonstration and training purposes only.

Production of bombes by BTM at Letchworth in wartime conditions was nowhere near as rapid as the Americans later achieved at NCR in Dayton, Ohio.

Sergeant Jones was given the overall responsibility for Bombe maintenance by Edward Travis. Later Squadron Leader and not to be confused with Eric Jones, he was one of the original bombe maintenance engineers, and experienced in BTM techniques. Welchman said that later in the war when other people tried to maintain them, they realised how lucky they were to have him. About 15 million delicate wire brushes on the drums had to make reliable contact with the terminals on the template. There were 104 brushes per drum, 720 drums per bombe, and ultimately around 200 bombes.

After World War II, some fifty bombes were retained at RAF Eastcote, while the rest were destroyed. The surviving bombes were put to work, possibly on Eastern bloc ciphers. Smith cites the official history of the bombe as saying that &quot;some of these machines were to be stored away but others were required to run new jobs and sixteen machines were kept comparatively busy on menus.&quot; and &quot;It is interesting to note that most of the jobs came up and the operating, checking and other times maintained were faster than the best times during the war periods.&quot;

==Response to the four-rotor Enigma==
A program was initiated by Bletchley Park to design much faster bombes that could decrypt the four-rotor system in a reasonable time. There were two streams of development. One, code-named Cobra, with an electronic sensing unit, was produced by Charles Wynn-Williams of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern and Tommy Flowers of the General Post Office (GPO). The other, code-named Mammoth, was designed by Harold Keen at BTM, Letchworth. Initial delivery was scheduled for August or September 1942. The dual development projects created considerable tension between the two teams, both of which cast doubts on the viability of the opposing team&#x27;s machine. After considerable internal rivalry and dispute, Gordon Welchman (by then, Bletchley Park&#x27;s Assistant Director for mechanisation) was forced to step in to resolve the situation. Ultimately, Cobra proved unreliable and Mammoth went into full-scale production.

Unlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Indeed, there was considerable rivalry between the US Army&#x27;s facility, the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS), and that of the US Navy known as OP-20-G. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain&#x27;s side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration amongst the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit.

In February 1941, Captain Abe Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and US Naval Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier, arrived at Bletchley Park bringing, amongst other things, a replica of the &quot;Purple&quot; cipher machine for Bletchley Park&#x27;s Japanese section in Hut 7. The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio direction-finding unit and many documents including a &quot;paper Enigma&quot;.

Currier later wrote:

The main response to the Four-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain.

===US Navy Bombe===
Colonel John Tiltman, who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office (OP-20-G) in April 1942 and recognised America&#x27;s vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress, prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full blueprints and wiring diagrams received by US Naval Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942. Funding for a full, $2 million, navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.
Commander Edward Travis, Deputy Director and Frank Birch, Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With Carl Frederick Holden, US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have &quot;a stronger claim than BRUSA to being the forerunner of the UKUSA Agreement,&quot; being the first agreement &quot;to establish the special Sigint relationship between the two countries,&quot; and &quot;it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance.&quot; It established a relationship of &quot;full collaboration&quot; between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.

An all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered, but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the National Cash Register Corporation (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio. This established the United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory. Engineering development was led by NCR&#x27;s Joseph Desch.

Alan Turing, who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941), was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs. He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as Banburismus. The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.

The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes. They had eight Enigma-equivalents on the front and eight on the back. The fast drum rotated at 1,725 rpm, 34 times the speed of the early British bombes. &#x27;Stops&#x27; were detected electronically using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes)—mostly thyratrons—for the high-speed circuits. When a &#x27;stop&#x27; was found the machine over-ran as it slowed, reversed to the position found and printed it out before restarting. The running time for a 4-rotor run was about 20 minutes, and for a 3-rotor run, about 50 seconds. Each machine was wide, high, deep and weighed 2.5 tons.

The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. By 22 June, the first two machines, called &#x27;Adam&#x27; and &#x27;Eve&#x27; broke a particularly difficult German naval cipher, the &quot;Offizier&quot; settings for 9 and 10 June. A P Mahon, who had joined the Naval Section in Hut 8 in 1941, reported in his official 1945 &quot;History of Hut Eight 1939-1945&quot;:

These bombes were faster, and soon more available, than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations. Consequently, they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work. In Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Cryptographic History of Work on German Naval Enigma&quot;, he wrote as follows.
Production was stopped in September 1944 after 121 bombes had been made. The last-manufactured US Navy bombe is on display at the US National Cryptologic Museum. Jack Ingram, former Curator of the museum, describes being told of the existence of a second bombe and searching for it but not finding it whole. Whether it remains in storage in pieces, waiting to be discovered, or no longer exists, is unknown.

===US Army Bombe===
The US Army Bombe was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. The contract for its creation was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It was known as &quot;003&quot; or &quot;Madame X&quot;. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately long high and wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.

==Bombe rebuild==
In 1994 a group led by John Harper of the BCS Computer Conservation Society started a project to build a working replica of a bombe. The project required detailed research, and took thirteen years of effort before the replica was completed, which was then put on display at the Bletchley Park museum. In March 2009 it won an Engineering Heritage Award. The Bombe rebuild was relocated to The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley Park in May 2018, the new gallery officially re-opening on 23 June 2018.

<text>The Volvo S80 is an executive car produced by the Swedish manufacturer Volvo Cars from 1998 to 2016 across two generations. It took the place of the rear-wheel-drive S90 as Volvo&#x27;s flagship sedan.

The first generation (1998–2006) was made available for the 1999 model year. It has since been built at the Torslanda Works in Gothenburg, Sweden, with a few 1999 model year cars for the North American market built at Volvo&#x27;s Halifax Assembly plant. Unlike most Volvo models, it did not have a station wagon version for its first generation.

The second generation (2006–2016) was released in 2006 as a model year 2007 car. It has an estate version, the third generation of the Volvo V70. In June 2007, the S80 scored the highest &quot;good&quot; rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash test performance for frontal, side, and rear impacts, earning it the IIHS Top Safety Pick.

The model was replaced by the second generation S90 in the later half of 2016.


== First generation (1998–2006) ==
The design takes styling cues from the Volvo ECC concept. The first-generation S80 is based on the Volvo P2 platform. Over 368,000 first-generation S80s were built. The S80 featured a straight-six engine in a transverse engine mounting. No existing manual gearbox would fit in the engine bay with the six-cylinder engine, so Volvo had to develop their own, the M65. It featured also an environmental specification, covering aspects such as allergens from textiles, fuel economy and the life cycle of the car from production to dismantling.

Volvo continued its safety tradition, offering front and rear integrated crumple zones, driver and front passenger dual threshold airbags with a collapsible three-stage steering column, Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) supplemented with air bags for driver and front passenger, along with a side curtain airbag for front and rear passengers, anti-submarine seats, five padded head restraints with Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), and automatic seat belt pretensioners while front belts also have height adjustment.

The S80 was initially available with four different engines. Starting the range was a detuned 2.4-litre five-cylinder. This was also available as a compressed natural gas (CNG) and as a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) version. The fully tuned version produced . Next up was a 2.9-litre six-cylinder, then T6, and finally, the 2.5-litre Volkswagen-sourced Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine. The 2.9 has a straight-six engine, while the T6 was powered by a de-bored twin-turbocharged version. The S80 used CAN bus multiplexing wiring to simplify the various electronic components and safety systems and linking the various ECU to save complexity and weight.

In 2000, there was the addition of the 2.5T, available with standard all-wheel drive. The 2.5T model featured a light-pressure turbocharger. and addition of the 2.3T, available in Thailand Version. Late 2001 introduced the five-cylinder common rail diesel D5, detuned to and sold as 2.4D in some markets. In some European countries, the entry level S80 came with a 2.0-litre five-cylinder turbocharged engine producing and a T5 badged S80 with the same engine but tuned to with the help of the Mitsubishi TD04-16t high pressure turbo also found in the early S60 T5s. These were sold in countries such as Portugal where larger capacity engines were penalized by heavy taxes.

In 2004 PremAir was introduced as a standard feature to the exterior radiator surface which converts up to 75 percent of ground level ozone in the radiator cooling air into oxygen, while the Interior Air Quality System cleans the air inside, detects for pollutants and automatically recirculates in comparison to the air outside. The upholstery was available in taupe, light sand or graphite and the leathers were tanned using natural plant materials. The S80 sheet metal content can be recycled, along with other metals that achieved an 85 overall percentage. Dual zone climate control and heated front seats along with a three position drivers memory setting were optional, and anti-smash and grab laminated side windows were available. Retractable sunshades for the rear side door windows and an electronically extendable rear window sunshade were available

The S80 came standard with Volvo&#x27;s own radio unit, the HU-613, the HU-803 and was later upgraded to the HU-650 and an optional extra HU-850 unit. The HU-850 unit features a 225 or 335-watt power output (depending on optional external amplifier) with three presets: 2CH, 3CH and Dolby Digital Pro Logic II Surround Sound. The Four-C electronically modified suspension became an option on some S80s.

Minor exterior design changes occurred between 2003 and 2004 versions, and in 2005 the Haldex-sourced AWD was available with the 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbo. In 2006 The AWD system was upgraded with a pre-charged, electronically controlled all-wheel drive system called Instant Traction, which consisted of constant hydraulic pressure that would divide available traction to the wheels as needed.

===Safety===
Euro NCAP tested the first generation Volvo S80, running from 1998 to 2003.
They tested a left-hand drive, 4-door saloon, registered in 2000, with front seatbelt pretensioners, seatbelt load limiters, as well as front, side, body, and head airbags:

Scores given for the car showed pedestrians&#x27; legs facing a very aggressive front end, resulting in only 2 stars of 4 for pedestrian safety. Despite this Euro NCAP did state &quot;This large Volvo is very safe and gave a good all-round performance&quot; due to the good adult protection inside the car in the event of a collision.
== Second generation (2006–2016) ==
The second generation S80 was unveiled at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show on 28 February, with sales beginning in June 2006. It was offered with newly-designed 3.2-litre straight-six or 4.4-litre V8 engine options, in combination with available four-wheel drive. The second-generation S80 is the first Volvo saloon model to become available with Volvo&#x27;s compact, transversely fitted B8444S V8 with a power output of and of torque developed jointly by Volvo Cars engine unit Skövde and Yamaha, but built by Yamaha of Japan. The engine features four catalytic converters and advanced electronics. The structure featured high strength boron steel for safety.

The second generation S80 received the IIHS 2007 Top Safety Pick Award in overall safety protection. Also again in November the IIHS awarded the 2008 Volvo S80 with Top Safety Award.

The new S80 is based on the Volvo P3 platform, also used for vehicles including the Ford S-Max, third generation Ford Mondeo, and Ford Galaxy large MPVs. Volvo&#x27;s Personal Car Communicator (PCC) remote control will also be an optional feature with the new S80.

The S80 is available with optional adaptive cruise control (ACC) with collision warning with auto brake (CWAB). Brake support offers additional assistance by preparing the braking system so that the car can begin stopping faster and preparing for panic brake application. S80 is also equipped with an adaptive brake light as standard which is active at speeds above , and can sense the difference between normal and panic braking. Ready alert brakes (RAB) are also available to anticipate severe braking. It prepares for this by moving the brake pads closer to the discs.

The S80 is available with a Blind Spot Information System as well as Lane Departure Warning, it can be turned on from .

The T4 variant features the 1.6L turbocharged EcoBoost engine and is exclusively available in Asia and parts of Europe.

New features for 2010 include a choice of five-cylinder 2.4-litre D5 twin-turbo diesel, 2.4-litre diesel, or 1.6-litre diesel engine. Also the 2.5T and 2.5FT were modified to produce more power and have a lower fuel consumption. The update marked the last year of the Yamaha-based V8 engine. An option was added for California on the 3.2L Inline-6 to meet PZEV emissions standards. It had 225 bhp, 10 less than the non-PZEV engine. The car&#x27;s exterior was modified to give the S80 a lower, longer and wider stance. More chrome trim was added to the front, the rear end, and the doors to look like the S80 Executive. The 2010 Volvo S80 facelift also comes with a choice between a comfort-enhancing standard chassis, or a sport one that offers better handling dynamics. The 2010 S80 will be available with a S80 R-design interior package to give the inside a sportier look.

==Special versions==
The S80 is also used as a base for specialised cars such as lengthened limousines, hearses, and ambulances. One company producing such models is &quot;Nilsson Special Vehicles&quot;, based in Laholm, Sweden. Ambulance models receive a completely new body from behind the b-pillar as well as a raised roof. A sliding side door is installed on the right hand side (sometimes on both sides) and the tailgate is enlarged to allow easier access. Nilsson only manufactured ambulances based on the first generation S80. Nilsson has built limousines and hearses based on both generations of the S80. They also manufacture the official state car for a few heads of state, including for the King of Sweden and the King of the Netherlands.

Armored versions were also available. The first generation could be ordered from the factory, with the actual armoring done by an outside company. The second generation armoured version was available from Czech specialists SVOS and no factory armoring was offered.

<doc id="615358" wikidata="Q3506288" url="?curid=615358" title="Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)">
<text>Caprice No. 24 in A minor is the final caprice of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s 24 Caprices, and a famous work for solo violin. The caprice, in the key of A minor, consists of a theme, 11 variations, and a finale. His 24 Caprices were probably composed between 1802 and 1817, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court.

It is widely considered one of the most difficult pieces ever written for the solo violin. It requires many highly advanced techniques such as parallel octaves and rapid shifting covering many intervals, extremely fast scales and arpeggios including minor scales, left hand pizzicato, high positions, and quick string crossings. Additionally, there are many double stops, including thirds and tenths.

==Variations on the theme==

* Angra – used the main theme for an interlude on electric guitar on the song &quot;Angels Cry&quot;, from the album of same name
* Aria – used as a basis for the main riff in the song &quot;Igra&#x27;s Ognyom&quot; (&quot;Playing with Fire&quot;) from the 1989 album of the same name. The plot of the song concerns a fictional violinist who is based on Paganini

<text>This is a list of weapons used by the [[United States Marine Corps]]:

==Weapons used==
The basic infantry weapon of the United States Marine Corps is the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. Suppressive fire is provided by the M240B machine gun, at the squad and company levels respectively. In addition, indirect fire is provided by the M320 grenade launcher in fireteams, M224A1 60 mm mortar in companies, and M252 81 mm mortar in battalions. The M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun and MK19 automatic grenade launcher (40 mm) are available for use by dismounted infantry, though they are more commonly vehicle-mounted. Precision fire is provided by the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System and M40A3, A5, A6 bolt-action sniper rifle.

The Marine Corps uses a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an offensive and defensive anti-armor capability. The SMAW and AT4 are unguided rockets that can destroy armor and fixed defenses (e.g. bunkers) at ranges up to 500 meters. The FGM-148 &quot;Javelin&quot; and BGM-71 TOW are anti-tank guided missiles; both can utilize top-attack profiles to avoid heavy frontal armor and are heavy missiles effective past 2,000 meters that give infantry an offensive capability against armor.

Marines are capable of deploying non-lethal weaponry as the situation dictates. Part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit earning the Special Operations Capable designator requires a company-sized unit capable of riot control.

Some older weapons are used for ceremonial purposes, such as the Silent Drill Platoon&#x27;s M1 Garands, or the use of the M101 howitzer for gun salutes.

<doc id="615360" wikidata="Q1200549" url="?curid=615360" title="Mariamman">
<text>Mariamman, often abbreviated to Amman (), is a Hindu goddess of weather, predominantly venerated in the rural areas of South India. Her festivals are held during the late summer/early autumn season of Ādi throughout Tamil Nadu and the Deccan region, the largest being the &quot;Ādi Thiruviḻa&quot;. Her worship mainly focuses on bringing rains and curing diseases like cholera, smallpox, and chicken pox. Mariamman is worshipped in accordance with local traditions such as &quot;Pidari&quot; or the &quot;Gramadevatai.&quot; She is considered as a guardian deity (kaval deivam) by many South Indian village-dwellers. She is also the regional form of hindu goddess Parvati. Her consort is lord Shiva. At samayapuram, she is the sister of Ranganathaswamy. She is also worshipped in Karnataka as Marikambe, who is a manifestation of Adi-Parashakti or Mahadevi.

==Origin==
Mariamman&#x27;s worship originated in the traditions of Dravidian folk religion. She is the main Tamil mother goddess, predominantly venerated in the rural areas of South India. Mariamman has since been associated with Hindu goddesses like Parvati, Kali, Durga, Rukmini, Sita, Draupadi, as well as with her northern Indian counterpart Shitala, her eastern Indian counterpart, Olai Chandi, and her western Indian counterpart of Mogal mata.

The word Mari (pronunciation: /mɒri/) has the Sangam Tamil origin meaning &quot;Rain&quot;, and the Dravidian root term Amman means &quot;Mother&quot;. She was worshipped by the ancient Tamils as the bringer of rain and thus also the bringer of prosperity, since the abundance of their crops was dependent largely upon adequate rainfall. The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly as goddesses. In Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kuravar priestesses in the shrine Palamutircholai.

==Iconography==
Mariamman is usually pictured as a beautiful young woman with a red-hued face, wearing a red dress. Sometimes she is portrayed with many arms—representing her many powers—but in most representations she has only two or four.

Mariamman is generally portrayed in the sitting or standing position, often holding a trident (trisula) in one hand and a bowl (kapala) in the other. One of her hands may display a mudra, usually the abhaya mudra, to ward off fear. She may be represented with two demeanours—one displaying her pleasant nature, and the other her terrifying aspect, with fangs and a wild mane of hair.

==Legends==
The origin of the goddess Mariamman in terms of a consistent and coherent legend has not been standardized, but several myths of the mother goddess exist in several regional traditions that are spread orally throughout South India.

According to a regional Hindu legend, there was once a beautiful woman named Nagavalli, wife to a rishi named Piruhu. When the rishi was away, the Trimurti, the deities of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, visited her, seeking to decide for themselves if she was truly as beautiful and virtuous as she was supposed to be. Nagavalli, not recognising them, and resenting their intrusion, turned them into children with her powers. The deities were infuriated and cursed her, causing her face to become disfigured with smallpox. When Piruhu returned, he drove her away, informing her that she would be born on earth, causing her affliction to human beings as well.

According to the Vanniyar community, an agrarian class, Draupadi, the common wife of the Pandavas, is said to be an incarnation of the goddess Shakti. Draupadi, despite being Shakti, lived like a normal woman, suppressing her supernatural powers. While they were in exile, when the Pandavas were asleep at night, she would travel to the villages of Vanniyar in the form of a fierce looking Goddess. Vanniyars would offer her prayers and barley, which pleased her. In time, she would be called Mariamman (the mother of rain and curing diseases), and became popular in the Vanniyar villages.

According to the narrative of the higher varnas, there was once a pariah boy who impersonated a Brahmin suitor in order to marry a Brahmin girl. This lie is discovered by the girl when she discerns the jargon and non-vegetarian habits of her in-laws. In order to ritually purify herself from the pollution of being married to a low-born pariah, the girl self-immolates. This Brahmin girl is deified and named as Mariamman, and becomes the goddess of the pariahs.

In northern India, Shitala is worshipped in a similar way, predominantly by the Rajput/Kshatriya community. Shitala has a legend and plays a similar role in protecting villages from diseases.

==Roles==

=== Goddess of medicine ===
Mariamman is purported to cure all so-called &quot;heat-based&quot; diseases. During the summer months in South India (March to June), people walk miles carrying pots of water mixed with turmeric and neem leaves to ward off illnesses like the measles and chicken pox.

=== Fertility goddess ===
Devotees also pray to Mariamman for familial welfare such as fertility, healthy progeny or a good spouse. The most favoured offering is &quot;pongal&quot;, a mix of rice and green gram, cooked mostly in the temple complex, or shrine itself, in terracotta pots using firewood.

Some festivals in honour of the goddess Mariamman involve night-time processions of devotees carrying oil lamps. Mariamman is the family deity for many in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. It is a custom initially to worship the family deity on occasions such as weddings. The worship of a &#x27;family deity&#x27; (kuladevata), considered most important in any Hindu festival, continues down the generations, providing a clue to the family&#x27;s origin, since the family deities are usually located within the vicinity of the village to which the family originally belonged.

==Worship==
The worshipping methods are often accompanied by various kinds of folk dancing. Offerings such as pongal and koozh that are cooked using earthen pots are also made during the festive season. Rituals such as fire walking and mouth or nose piercing are also practised.

At the Samayapuram Mariamman Temple in Samayapuram, the Hindu system of worship is still seen today for the worship of Mariyamman, which involves a ten-day festival organized by temple authorities during the second week in April. Some continue to use an old village custom of worship by offering chickens and goats to the deity, though the animals are no longer sacrificed but sold after being offered. The main worship of the goddess occurs on the road a mile or two from the temple. A hurried walk and dance carry hundreds of thousands of worshippers along the road to the temple. Many in the crowd have fasted, shaved their heads, and wear bright yellow clothes which are sacred to the goddess. Women and children may carry a pot on their heads decorated with the goddess&#x27;s favourite leaves, of the margosa tree. Young men and women, carrying similar pots, are followed by drummers and dance more wildly. Larger men and women carry pots of charcoal fire. Some put themselves through a special tribulation of having one of the sacred weapons, dagger, trident, or spear, inserted through their cheeks or tongues. Through this worship each individual achieves self-realization and awareness of others through samsara and moksha. In this self-realization a bonding with the goddess occurs, which is the underlining reason for the worship.

=== Mulaikottu ===
Mulaikottu is a village festival celebrated in southern Tamil Nadu, particularly in villages of Madurai, Sivagangai, Dindugul, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Thirunelveli districts. By doing so they believe that they can get her blessing and sufficient rain for better cultivation. This festival is generally celebrated in between Any Tamil month of panguni to Purattasi. The festival lasts for 11 days. (Sunday of first week to Wednesday of second week).

On the auspicious beginning of the village festival, a village meeting will be convened to sort out the best suitable date for the celebration of Mulaikottu. Before fixing any date, the &quot;pradhana&quot; and secretary of the village gather some information from the villagers regarding any marriage or anyone suffering from chicken pox etc. If anyone is affected by chicken pox, any sudden death occurred or someone&#x27;s marriage is taking place, under these circumstances the date of mulaikottu will be either postponed or cancelled according to the public opinion at the meeting. The celebration begins with collection of nine different types of grain seeds from every house, called &quot;thandal&quot; in Tamil. The Thandal will held in Sunday of Valarpirai. The following Tuesday is the second day of thandal called &quot;Pari parapputhal&quot;. Next Tuesday, the main function is held on the day called &quot;mulaikottu&quot;. On the next day of thandal, the temple committee distribute the grains to every house for setting up of pari.

The pari is a clay pot with a wide mouth and narrow base with a hole in the bottom. This utensil is specially made for this purpose and sold at the market. The villagers visit the market and purchase number of paris as they wanted to set up in their home.

The first step to set them up is to clean paris and their home the second day of thandal. People used to collect goat dung and some hay. The hay is used to block the hole of the pari. A layer of goat dung is spread over the hay and watered to make the dung wet. This is the procedure of setting up of pari.

As a next step to this, the received nine type of grains from the temple committee, is smoothly spread over the goat dung on the pari. Following this, a pooja will be arranged for praying the goddess to make the pari a successful one. Every house may have more than two paries. These paries taken into a dark and isolated room in their house. For the next seven days they have to grow the seedlings into a plant. Usage of loudspeaker and crackers are completely banned during this period. During evening, all villagers assemble in front of the Mariamman temple and sing folk songs known as &quot;mari pattu&quot; and dance folk dances such as &quot;mulaikottu&quot; ( similar to kummi), Amman oyil. It is followed everyday from thandal Sunday (First day) to next Sunday (eighth day). The ninth day called &quot;thangal&quot;, means camping. On this day the temple is closed and folk poojas and dances are prohibited. The Amman karagam is made in village water body and the person who fasts in those 10 days is called &quot;Ammadi&quot; (The person who depicted as Amman). The amandi takes the karagam and gave to temple. All &quot;paris&quot; are brought into the Amman temple from the houses on the tenth day of thandal. The paris remain in the Amman temple for one night and on the next day (the last day, eleventh day, Wednesday), and after a pooja, the paries will be issued back to their respective member. The Ammadi again takes karagam and the &quot;mulaiparis&quot; are also taken from the temple. Finally, the amman Karagam and mulaiparis are submerged into the village pond. It is also celebrated in Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple on the Tamil month of Aadi.

===In the Tamil Diaspora===
Her worship has been brought over across the Tamil Diaspora in places such as the Caribbean (See: Caribbean Shaktism), South Africa, Mauritius, Reunion Island, Singapore, Vietnam, and Fiji where festivities and temples are often done and built in her name. Her trance-worship has been brought via the Girmityas to around the world, where similar traditions to those in Mainland Tamil Nadu are practiced. Often times, Mariamman is syncretized with Kali.

==Temples==

Most temples to Mariamman are simple village shrines, where both male and female priests perform sacred rituals. In many rural shrines, the goddess is represented by a granite stone with a sharp tip, like a spear head. This stone is often adorned with garlands made of limes and with red flowers. These shrines often have an anthill that could be the resting place of a cobra. Milk and eggs are offered to propitiate the snake.

Some temples have attained sufficient popularity for Brahmanas to officiate at them. For example, the Samayapuram Mariamman near the shore of river Kaveri in the northern outskirts of Tiruchirapalli, maintains a rich agamic tradition and all rituals are performed by Gurukkalas.

Punainallur, near Thanjavur, is the location of another famous Mariamman temple. Legend says that Mariamman appeared to the King Venkoji Maharaja Chatrapati (1676–1688) of Thanjavur in his dreams and told him she was in a forest of Punnai trees three miles distant from Thanjavur. The King rushed to the spot and recovered an idol of Mariamman from the jungle. On the king&#x27;s orders a temple was constructed there, the idol installed, and the place was called Punnainallur. Hence the deity of this temple is known as Punnainallur Mariamman. Mud replicas of different parts of the human body are placed in the temple as offerings by devotees pleading for cure. It is said that the daughter of Tulaja Raja (1729–35) of Thanjavur, who lost her eyesight due to illness, regained it after worshipping at this temple. Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra is said to have made the Moola Murthi of the Goddess Maariamman from the mud from the ant-hill where snakes had resided.

Salem Kottai Sri Periya Mariamman temple which is located in the heart of the city, the Aadi festival celebrated for 22 days.

The Erode Mariamman temple festival is a grand one in Tamil Nadu. The worship of three Mariamman goddesses named Small, Medium and Large Mariamman (residing at three separate localities within the city) is combined in a festival every April. It features the Thiruvizha, along with all the other devotions to deities, and ends at the Kaveri river with the purificatory immersion of the Kambam (the effigy of Mariamman&#x27;s husband Shiva) in the flowing waters of the river.

The Karur Mariamman temple festival, which is celebrated at the end of May each year, is another notable festival held in honour of the goddess in Tamil Nadu.

Other important temples of Mariamman in Tamil Nadu are in the towns of Veerapandi, Theni, Anbil (near Trichy), Narthamalai, Thiruverkadu, Salem, Virudhunagar and Sivakasi, Vellore. In Chennai (Madras), a famous Mariamman temple is the Putthu Mariamman: the eponymous Putthu (ant-hill) being located across the road from the temple on the opposite side of the Velachery Main Road.

In 2012, the singer Harini composed a song about the Samayapuram Mariamman deity which was featured on the album &quot;Om Nava Sakthi Jaya Jaya Sakthi&quot;. The song narrates the power of Shakti as Samayapuram Amman and equates the Peruvalai River with Punya Theertham, as do the people in that area.

Madurai is home to the Theppakulam sri Mariamman Temple, a noted focus of devotion, primarily to the goddess but also to the Maruthuvachi (= doctor/midwife). Periyachi Amman (or Pechi Amman), who was deified for her skill and heroism. The temple possesses a large theppakulam. Here the Panguni festival is the main event of the religious calendar. The devotees of The goddess Mariamman observe the &quot;poo choridhal&quot; flower festival, and in the month of Aadi many women honour her with fasting and prayer.

Another famous Mariamman temple is situated in the state of Karnataka, in the town of Kaup, seven kilometres from the famous temple town of Udipi.

There is also a famous and highly regarded Mariamman temple in Urwa, a residential area of the city of Mangalore, where through the power of the goddess many miracles have been reported to occur. The temple is known familiarly as Urwa Marigudi.

<text>Lunate is a crescent or moon-shaped microlith. In the specialized terminology of lithic reduction, a lunate flake is a small, crescent-shaped flake removed from a stone tool during the process of pressure flaking.

In the Natufian period, a lunate was a small crescent-shaped stone tool that was sometimes used to harvest grasses.

In archaeology a lunate is a small stone artifact, that has a sharpened straight edge and a blunt crescent shaped back. 
The word originates from the Latin word &quot;lunatus&quot; which means to bend like a crescent, and from luna meaning moon in Latin. 
A lunate object can be typically used as a decorative piece or as a stone tool.

==Israeli lunate==
In the earlier findings of Epipaleolithic lunate in the Natufian, Harifian, and Negev Kebaran periods in Israel, they were roughly 10–40 mm long and were formed on small blades or bladelets. While the later findings Natufian and Harifian range of lengths varied then between 9 mm and 17 mm. In the later period, the lunate resulted in three specific types:
* Helwan Backing (Bifacial)
* Plain Abrupt Backing
* Bipolar Backing (anvil)
The differences among these three types are also associated with the length of the lunate objects, with Helwan lunate normally being the longest and bipolar being the shortest. 
For unknown reasons, the epipaleolithic lunate tool type disappeared and did not reappear until around the end of the 4th millennium B.C. 

These Lunate tools were most likely used as barbs in arrow shafts, or as transverse arrowheads coated with poison. The Lunate are also a very rare artifact from the Early Bronze Age because there was not as much emphasis on hunting during that period. The reappearance of Lunate after several millennia could shed some light on the hunting emphasis in the society. 

Lunate have been found as far north as the Azor tombs in Israel and was far south as south Sinai in this particular region.

==Other cultural examples==
Lunate artefacts have been discovered among early Māori stone carving in New Zealand. The original lunate pendant found in New Zealand appears to be of clear transparent pounamu (greenstone), from Ruapuke Island, in Foveaux Strait. Its characteristics include a notched edge and the stone itself is thought to originate from Tangiwai, New Zealand. There was a second rare lunate-shaped object discovered in the New Zealand ethnological region as well.

A handful of ancient societies shaped their tools in the form of lunate such as the Puebloan peoples who originated around San Juan County, Utah. There have also been findings of lunate used by Puebloan peoples dating back to the 3rd/4th millennium B.C.

This area was a fertile delta along Old-Yamato River, and has been cultivated since Yayoi period. In the Kofun period, many powerful clans settled here and built &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds in the foothills of the Ikoma mountain range. In Asuka period, this area was under the control of Mononobe clan. The clan was destroyed when Mononobe no Moriya was defeated by Soga no Umako. The Yuge clan, which was a cadet branch of Mononobe clan, however, kept control on the area. The monk Dōkyō, who was from Yuge clan, became the most powerful person in the late Nara period through his relationship with Empress Shōtoku. He constructed &quot;Saikyo&quot; (West Capital) called Yuge-gu in this area, from which he intended rule the nation prior to his fall from power. Takayasu Castle, an ancient castle on Mount Takayasu, was constructed for defense against Tang dynasty, after Yamato was defeated at the Battle of Baekgang in Korean Peninsula and rediscovered by archaeologists in 1978. During the Nara period, the area Yao prospered as a transportation hub between Yamato Province, Naniwa-kyō and the seacoast. During the Heian period, the area was dominated by large &quot;shōen&quot; landed estates controlled by Buddhist temples and the nobility. In the Sengoku period the area was the site of several battles, including during the summer campaign of Siege of Osaka.

Before the middle term of Edo period, the Yamato river flowed from south to north and joined to the Yodo River. However, due to flooding, the Tokugawa shogunate undertook a large public works project to change the flow of the Yamato River from east to west, to empty into Osaka Bay directly. The construction decreased number of floods, and enabled this area to develop more paddy fields. In addition, cotton cultivation flourished in this area.

===Modern===
After the Meiji restoration, the area became part of Osaka Prefecture. The village Yao created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, although the name &quot;Yao&quot; appears as far back as Heian period documents. On April 1, 1896 the area became part of Nakakawachi District, Osaka. Yao was elevated to town status on August 1, 1903. On April 1, 1948, Yao merged with the town of Ryuge and the villages of Kyuhoji, Taisho, and Nishigo to form the city of Yao.

==Government==
Yao has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Yao contributes three members to the Osaka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 14th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. 

==Economy==
Yao is traditionally known for its production of toothbrushes, and still accounts for 40% of the Japanese market, although the contribution of toothbrush manufacturing to the total local economy is very small. The city is now known as a center for light and medium manufacturing.

<text>In Indian religions, a darshan (Sanskrit: दर्शन, ; &#x27;showing, appearance, view, sight&#x27;) or darshanam is the auspicious sight of a deity or a holy person.

The term also refers to any one of the six traditional schools of Hindu philosophy and their literature on spirituality and soteriology.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;darshana&quot;, also in the forms of &quot;darśana&quot; or &quot;darshanam&quot;, comes from the Sanskrit root of दर्शन &quot;dṛś&quot; &#x27;to look at&#x27;, &#x27;to view&#x27;, vision, apparition or glimpse.

==Definition==
&quot;Darshana&quot; is described as an &quot;auspicious sight&quot; of a holy person, which bestows merit on the viewer.

It is most commonly used for theophany, meaning a manifestation or vision of the divine.

==In Hinduism==
In Hindu worship, it refers to seeing a deity (especially in image form), or a very holy person or artifact. One can receive &quot;darshana&quot; or a glimpse of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great guru. One can also take &quot;darshana&quot; of a sacred places like Kashi, Yamuna or Mount Kailash.

In Hindu practice, adherents often refer to their temple visits as going for &quot;darshana&quot; rather than simply worship. Darshana, often translated as the &quot;auspicious sight&quot; of the divine, involves seeing the deity&#x27;s image (&quot;murti&quot;). This visual experience is charged with religious significance, as the deity is believed to be present in the image, allowing worshippers to receive divine blessings through their gaze. 

The term &quot;darshana&quot; also refers to the six systems of thought, called &quot;darshanam&quot;, that comprise classical Hindu philosophy. The term therein implies how each of these six systems distinctively look at things and the scriptures in Indian philosophies. The six Hindu &quot;darshana&quot; are Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta. Buddhism and Jainism are examples of non-Hindu darshans.

==Mahayana Buddhism==

On the significance of &quot;darshana&quot; in Mahayana thought, Paul Harrison writes: &quot;By the second century CE... the vision of the Buddha (&quot;buddha-darśana&quot;) and the accompanying hearing of the Dharma (&quot;dharma-śravaṇa&quot;) are represented as a transformation experience of decisive importance for practitioners, be they who have renounced (mundane life) &#x27;ascetics&#x27; or householders.&quot;

The Abhidharma, collections of systematic summaries of the sutras, mention &quot;Darshana-citta, i.e.&quot; visions.

Indian Mahayana philosophers Vasubandhu and Asanga acknowledged five paths to liberation, of which the third is &quot;darshana-marga&quot;, the &quot;path of seeing&quot;.

Nagarjuna, a prominent philosopher of the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, wrote that the wise person perceives &quot;tattva-darshana,&quot; true reality.

==Other meanings==
&quot;Darshana&quot; also sometimes has a more mundane meaning. For example, Sivananda Saraswati wrote in his book &quot;The Practice of Brahmacharya&quot; that one of the eight aspects of brahmacharya (celibacy) is not to look lustfully at women: &quot;You should carefully avoid ... Darshana or looking at women with passionate resolve&quot;.

Scholar of religion Richard H. Davis has said that &quot;darshana&quot; (viewpoint, philosophical school) is one of three terms in classical Indian discourse that could be considered roughly analogous to what today&#x27;s English-speakers understand as &quot;religion.&quot; The other two terms are &quot;dharma&quot; (duty, morality, a code of proper conduct) and &quot;marga&quot; (route, spiritual path). According to Davis, &quot;most Hindu texts accepted that religious paths (&quot;marga&quot;) are relative to the points of view (&quot;darśana&quot;) and moral responsibilities (&quot;dharma&quot;) of practitioners, whose individual circumstances may make one or another course of action more appropriate in their particular situations.&quot;

Poet Gary Snyder has given a naturalistic meaning to &quot;darshana&quot;:
&quot;Darshan&quot; is also a part of the name of India&#x27;s public broadcaster &quot;Doordarshan&quot; combining the word दूर &quot;dūra&quot; &#x27;far&#x27; altogether making दूरदर्शन &quot;dūrdarśan&quot; &#x27;television&#x27;.

<text>The Fiat 500, commonly known as &quot;Topolino&quot; (), is an Italian city car produced and manufactured by Fiat from 1936 to 1955.

The name &quot;Topolino&quot; is , and is also the Italian name for Mickey Mouse.

==History==
The Topolino was one of the smallest cars in the world at the time of its production. Launched in 1936, three models were produced until 1955, all with only minor mechanical and cosmetic changes. It was equipped with a 569 cc four-cylinder, side-valve, water-cooled engine mounted in front of the front axle (later an overhead valve motor), and so was a full-scale car rather than a cyclecar. The radiator was located behind the engine which made possible a lowered aerodynamic nose profile at a time when competitors had a flat, nearly vertical grille. The shape of the car&#x27;s front allowed exceptional forward visibility.

Rear suspension initially used quarter-elliptic rear springs, but buyers frequently squeezed four or five people into the nominally two-seater car, and in later models the chassis was extended at the rear to allow for more robust semi-elliptic springs.

With a power of about , its top speed was about 85 km/h (53 mph), and it could achieve a fuel consumption of about . The target price given when the car was planned was 5,000 lire. The price at launch was 9,750 lire, though the decade was one of falling prices in several parts of Europe and later in the 1930&#x27;s the Topolino was sold for about 8,900 lire. Despite being more expensive than first envisioned, the car was competitively priced. Nearly 520,000 were sold.

Three models were produced. The Model A and B shared the same body, but the engine of the model B had of power, compared to the of the Model A, produced from 1937 to 1948, while the model B was produced in 1948 and 1949. The model A was offered as a 2-door saloon, 2-door convertible saloon with a folding roof and a 2-door van, while the Model B also introduced a 3-door estate under the name 500 B Giardiniera (&quot;estate car&quot;).

The Giardiniera was initially only available as a so-called woodie, with an outside ash frame being used instead of steel, and was available in seven metallic colors. When it was later renamed the Belvedere, the wood was replaced with metal. This model and the regular two-seater Convertible-Limousine were also produced in France by Simca as the &quot;Simca 5&quot;, and in Germany by the German Fiat subsidiary NSU-Fiat.

The Model C was introduced in 1949 with a restyled body and the same engine as the Model B, and was offered in 2-door saloon, 2-door convertible saloon, 3-door estate and 2-door van body styles. In 1952, the Giardiniera was renamed the Belvedere (&quot;A turret or other raised structure offering a pleasant view of the surrounding area&quot;, referring to its sunroof). The Model C was produced until 1955.

In 1955 the larger rear-wheel-drive Fiat 600 was launched by Fiat and that would become the design basis for the new Fiat 500, the Nuova 500. These two models ended up replacing the original 500.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;La Topolino Amarante&quot; is a 1975 song by the Italian artist Paolo Conte. The song&#x27;s lyrics are about the summer of 1946 (″&quot;È l&#x27;estate del &#x27;46&quot;″) so probably the mentioned car is the first model Fiat 500 A in amaranth color.
* After its initial run, the Topolino became a popular choice for hot rodders in North America beginning in the 1950s, due to their lightweight size, rear-wheel drive, and ability to fit a V8 engine underneath the hood.

<text>A tinderbox, or patch box, is a container made of wood or metal containing flint, firesteel, and tinder (typically charcloth, but possibly a small quantity of dry, finely divided fibrous matter such as hemp), used together to help kindle a fire. A tinderbox may also contain sulfur-tipped matches.

Tinderboxes fell out of general usage when friction matches were invented.

== History and use ==

Throughout prehistoric Europe flint and iron pyrites (commonly known as fool&#x27;s gold) were struck against one another in order to create a spark for firelighting. As an example, Ötzi (the natural mummy of a man who lived some time between 3350 and 3105 BC, discovered in September 1991) was found with tinder fungus along with flint and pyrite for creating sparks.

With the development of iron ore smelting in the Iron Age, the firesteel eventually replaced pyrites. This was simply a piece of carbon steel (it is difficult to obtain sparks with ordinary iron), which was usually wrought into a &#x27;D&#x27; shape, or an oval ring, so that it could be conveniently looped around two or three fingers for striking. The flint was sometimes chipped to provide a suitably sharp edge to obtain a spark and if necessary other hard stones, such as quartzite, chert or chalcedony could be substituted.

The charcloth was fabric made from vegetable fibre (e.g. cotton, linen, or jute) which had previously been charred via pyrolysis, giving it the low ignition temperature and slow burning characteristics suitable for use as tinder. Rotten wood, known as , was also used, as well as amadou, which was a tinder prepared from fungus steeped in potassium nitrate (saltpetre) and dried.

In use the flint was struck in a vigorous downward motion against the steel, sending a shower of sparks into the tinder which was arranged in the bottom of the box. The sparks (actually pieces of burning steel broken off by the harder flint) created very small embers as they fell onto the charcloth, the glow of which, with some gentle blowing, would be enough to ignite a sulfur tipped wooden splint. The splint could then be carried to a candle, often set in a holder on the top of the box, and finally the cloth would be extinguished with a damper to preserve it for further use. With skill, a fire could be started in under a minute, but at other times it took longer and occasionally a tiny pinch of gunpowder was added to encourage the process.
When away from home small pocket tinderboxes were often carried, sometimes set with a burning glass (a magnifying lens) in the lid to light the tinder directly from the sun&#x27;s rays. The poorer people working in the fields would obtain a light by simply striking a flint on the back of a knife onto a piece of touchpaper that they carried in their pockets.

The tinder pistol, based on the flintlock mechanism, was a more expensive alternative to the tinderbox and was in use in middle and upper-class homes in the 18th century. 
In the early 19th century a more efficient tinderbox was invented with a rotating metal wheel to create the sparks and there were other more experimental devices available, such as the fire piston and the instantaneous light box. 
In the 18th and early 19th century tinderboxes were in common use, but with the advent of John Walker&#x27;s &#x27;friction lights&#x27; in 1827, where a match could be struck by withdrawing it from a piece of folded glass paper, tinderboxes increasingly became obsolete. A book from 1881 notes that in 1834 a magazine editor had predicted that despite the advent of &#x27;lucifers&#x27; (friction matches), the tinderbox would continue to be in general use in the household, but that in fact, by the time of writing, the tinderbox had become rare, expensive and was commonly seen only in museums of antiquities. Another book from 1889 describes such a tinderbox, observing that the wear patterns on the flint were the same as those on ancient prehistoric flints in the collection.

== As metaphor ==

In conventional usage, the term &quot;tinderbox&quot; refers to something that is so dry that it could catch on fire with the slightest provocation, perhaps even spontaneously like a forest fire. It is also used to describe a potentially volatile or violent situation. For instance, a prison in which there is unrest and the potential for a riot could be said to be &#x27;a tinderbox of violence&#x27;.

<text>The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) was part of the United States Air Force (USAF) human spaceflight program in the 1960s. The project was developed from early USAF concepts of crewed space stations as reconnaissance satellites, and was a successor to the canceled Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar military reconnaissance space plane. Plans for the MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, for which crews would be launched on 30-day missions, and return to Earth using a Gemini B spacecraft derived from NASA&#x27;s Gemini spacecraft and launched with the laboratory.

The MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to demonstrate the utility of putting people in space for military missions; its reconnaissance satellite mission was a secret black project. Seventeen astronauts were selected for the program, including Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr., the first African-American astronaut. The prime contractor for the spacecraft was McDonnell Aircraft Corporation; the laboratory was built by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA&#x27;s Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) was developed to permit launches into polar orbit.

As the 1960s progressed, the Vietnam War competed with the MOL for funds, and resultant budget cuts repeatedly postponed its first operational flight. At the same time, automated systems rapidly improved, narrowing the benefits of a crewed space platform over an automated one. A single uncrewed test flight of the Gemini B spacecraft was conducted on 3 November 1966, but the MOL was canceled in June 1969 without any crewed missions being flown.

Seven of the astronauts transferred to NASA in August 1969 as NASA Astronaut Group 7, all of whom eventually flew in space on the Space Shuttle between 1981 and 1985. The Titan IIIM rocket developed for the MOL never flew, but its UA1207 solid rocket boosters were used on the Titan IV, and the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster was based on materials, processes and designs developed for them. NASA spacesuits were derived from the MOL ones, MOL&#x27;s waste management system flew in space on Skylab, and NASA Earth Science used other MOL equipment. SLC-6 was refurbished, but plans to have military Space Shuttle launches from there were abandoned in the wake of the January 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

== Background ==
At the height of the Cold War in the mid-1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) was particularly interested in the Soviet Union&#x27;s military and industrial capabilities. Starting in 1956, the United States conducted covert U-2 spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of before the downing of a U-2 in 1960 abruptly ended the program. This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped spy satellites would fill. In July 1957before anyone had flown in spacethe USAF Wright Air Development Center published a paper that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices. The USAF had already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. This had three components: SAMOS, a spy satellite; Corona, an experimental program to develop the technology; and MIDAS, an early warning system.
The launch of Sputnik 1, the first satellite, by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had assumed American technical superiority. One benefit of the Sputnik crisis was that no government protested Sputnik&#x27;s overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it much harder for the Soviets to object to overflights by satellites from another country. In February 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Corona as a joint interim project with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

In August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles transferred US$53.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ) that had been set aside for USAF space projects to NASA. This left the USAF with a few programs with direct military impact. One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar. The USAF remained interested in space, and in March 1959, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Thomas D. White asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the plan was a &quot;manned orbital laboratory&quot;.

The USAF Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) issued a request to the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. A request for proposal (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August 1960, General Electric, Lockheed Aircraft, Glenn L. Martin Company, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, and General Dynamics shared US$574,999 (equivalent to $ in ) for a study of the MTSS. Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July 1961. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961, the USAF submitted a request for US$5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in funding for space station studies in fiscal year 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.

In its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a Titan I booster, its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966. In a 22 February 1962 memorandum to the Secretary of the Air Force, Eugene Zuckert, the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase; the Dyna-Soar was now planned to be launched by a Titan III booster.

The same 22 February 1962 memorandum gave tacit approval for the development of a space station. The USAF staff and the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a Military Orbital Development System (MODS). By the end of May 1962, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up. For tracking purposes, it was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA Gemini spacecraft that became known as Blue Gemini, and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a shirt-sleeve environment for a crew of four for up to 30 days. On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General Bernard Adolph Schriever, the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program. The name was chosen because NASA did not want the Department of Defense (DoD) to use the term &quot;space station&quot;.

On 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested US$75 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in funding for MODS and US$102 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for Blue Gemini. Since Project Gemini was now associated with national security, McNamara considered taking over the entire project from NASA, but after some negotiation with NASA, McNamara and NASA Administrator James E. Webb reached an agreement on collaboration on the project in January 1963.

McNamara called for a review of whether Dyna-Soar had military capabilities that could not be met by Gemini, on 18 January 1963. In his 14 November 1963 response, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E), Harold Brown, examined options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply of consumables arriving every 120 days. On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation of the MOL program.

Soon after coming to office, the Kennedy administration tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities. No administration official would even admit they existed until President Jimmy Carter did so in 1978. MOL was therefore a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the secret Corona spy satellite program.

== Initiation ==
On 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL. About US$6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, Martin Marietta of the Titan III booster, and Eastman Kodak of camera optics, the basic equipment of a satellite reconnaissance equipment. Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications and radar.

The United States Under Secretary of the Air Force and the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Brockway McMillan, asked the director of NRO Program A (the component of NRO responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), Major General Robert Evans Greer, to look into the MOL&#x27;s potential reconnaissance capabilities. These studies cost US$3,237,716 (equivalent to $ in ). The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost US$1,189,500 (equivalent to $ in ), followed by the Titan III interface, which cost US$910,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

The USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February 1965, Boeing, Douglas, General Electric and Lockheed were selected to carry out design studies. Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified secret and given the code name &quot;Dorian&quot;. In February 1969, the MOL was given a Keyhole (reconnaissance satellite) designation as KH-10 Dorian.

As a black project (i.e. one that was secret and publicly unacknowledged), but one impossible to completely conceal, MOL needed some &quot;white&quot; (i.e. unclassified and publicly acknowledged) experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by several agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964. Although reconnaissance was its main purpose, &quot;manned orbiting laboratory&quot; was still an accurate description; the program hoped to prove that astronauts could perform militarily useful tasks in a shirt-sleeve environment in space for up to thirty days.

The USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at US$1.653 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). The Science Advisor to the President, Donald Hornig, reviewed the USAF&#x27;s submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, a human-operated system was far superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, the gap between the two could be reduced. He also noted that while countries had not objected to satellites passing overhead, a crewed space station might be a different matter, but the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, thought that this could be managed.

There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated KH-8 Gambit 3 satellite then under development justified the cost. The Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral William Raborn agreed that it might. McNamara took the proposal to President Lyndon Johnson on 24 August 1965, who approved it, and issued an official announcement at a press conference the following day.

In January 1965, Schriever had appointed Brigadier General Harry L. Evans as his deputy for MOL. Evans had previously worked with Schriever in the USAF Ballistic Systems Division. He had also been the Corona program manager, and had supervised SAMOS, MIDAS and SAINT, together with the early communications and weather satellite programs. As well as being Schriever&#x27;s deputy, Evans became Zuckert&#x27;s Special Assistant for MOL on 18 January 1965. In this role, he reported directly to Zuckert, and was responsible for liaising between MOL and other agencies such as NASA.

In the wake of Johnson&#x27;s announcement of the program, MOL was given the designation Program 632A. The USAF announced the appointment of Schriever as MOL director and Evans as vice director, in charge of the MOL staff at the Pentagon, with Brigadier General Russell A. Berg as deputy director, in charge of the MOL staff at the Los Angeles Air Force Station in El Segundo, California. The MOL System Program Office (SPO) was created in March 1964 under Brigadier General Joseph S. Bleymaier, the Deputy Commander of the AFSC Space Systems Division (SSD). By August 1965, the MOL had a staff of 42 military and 23 civilian personnel. Schriever retired from the Air Force in August 1966, and was succeeded as head of the AFSC and MOL Program Director by Major General James Ferguson. Evans retired from the Air Force on 27 March 1968, and was replaced by Major General James T. Stewart.

Schriever and the Director of the NRO, Alexander H. Flax, signed a formal agreement covering MOL Black Financial Procedures on 4 November 1965. Under this agreement, the Deputy Director MOL would forward black budget cost estimates to the NRO Controller, who had the authority to obligate NRO funds. This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December 1965 and signed by Leonard Marks Jr., the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management &amp; Comptroller). This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO. Thus far no definition contracts had been let, except for the Titan III expendable launch vehicle. On 30 September 1965, Brown released US$12 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in fiscal year 1965 funds and US$50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in fiscal year 1966 funds for the MOL definition phase activities.

Johnson had announced two MOL contractors: Douglas and General Electric. While the former had considerable technical and managerial experience from the Thor, Genie and Nike projects, General Electric had experience with large optical systems, and, perhaps more importantly, had over a thousand personnel immediately cleared for Dorian, while Douglas had very few. A US$10.55 million (equivalent to $ million in ) fixed-price contract was signed with Douglas on 17 October 1965. Contract negotiations with General Electric were also completed around this time, and the company was given US$4.922 million (equivalent to $ million in ), all but US$0.975 million (equivalent to $ million in ) of it in black budget funds.

The Aerospace Corporation was given responsibility for general systems engineering and technical direction. Douglas selected five major subcontractors: Hamilton-Standard for environmental control and life support; Collins Radio for communications; Honeywell for attitude control; Pratt &amp; Whitney for electrical power; and IBM for data management. Aerospace and the MOL SPO concurred with all but the last, noting that while IBM had a technically superior bid to UNIVAC, its estimated cost was US$32 million (equivalent to $ million in ) compared to UNIVAC&#x27;s US$16.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Douglas decided to let study contracts to both firms.

== Astronauts ==
=== Selection ===


To provide prospective astronauts for the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft, Dyna-Soar and MOL programs, on 5 June 1961 the USAF created the Aerospace Research Pilot Course at the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The school was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on 12 October 1961. Four classes were conducted between June 1961 and May 1963, the third receiving instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The commandant of the ARPS, Colonel Charles E. &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager, advised Schriever to restrict the selection of astronauts for the MOL to ARPS graduates. The program did not accept applications; 15 candidates were selected and sent to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for NASA astronaut groups.

For the first three NASA astronaut groups in 1959, 1962 and 1963, the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The Chief of Staff of the USAF, General John P. McConnell, informed Schriever that he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. A selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by Major General Jerry D. Page. On 15 September 1965, the selection criteria for MOL was announced. Candidates had to be:
* Qualified military pilots;
* Graduates of the ARPS;
* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and
* Holding U.S. citizenship from birth.

In October 1965, the MOL Policy Committee decided that MOL crew members would be designated &quot;MOL Aerospace Research Pilots&quot; rather than astronauts.

The names of the first group of eight MOL pilots were announced on 12 November 1965 as a Friday night news dump to avoid press attention.
* Major Michael J. Adams, USAF
* Major Albert H. Crews Jr., USAF
* Lieutenant John L. Finley, USN
* Captain Richard E. Lawyer, USAF
* Captain Lachlan Macleay, USAF
* Captain Francis G. Neubeck, USAF
* Major James M. Taylor, USAF
* Lieutenant Richard H. Truly, USN.

To prevent their return to the Navy on graduation, Finley and Truly were retained as instructors until the announcement.

In late 1965, the USAF began selecting a second group of MOL pilots. This time applications were accepted. Selection occurred at the same time as that for NASA Astronaut Group 5, many applying to both programs. Successful candidates were told that NASA or MOL had chosen them, with no explanation why they had been chosen by one and not the other. Over 500 applications were received and 100 were forwarded to USAF Headquarters. The MOL Program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected, and their names were publicly announced on 17 June 1966:
* Captain Karol J. Bobko, USAF
* Lieutenant Robert L. Crippen, USN
* Captain C. Gordon Fullerton, USAF
* Captain Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., USAF
* Captain Robert F. Overmyer, USMC.

Bobko was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to be selected as an astronaut.

Eight other finalists for the second class had not yet completed ARPS. One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on 11 May 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on 30 June 1967:
* Major James A. Abrahamson, USAF
* Lieutenant Colonel Robert T. Herres, USAF
* Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr., USAF
* Major Donald H. Peterson, USAF.

Lawrence was the first African-American to be chosen as an astronaut.

=== Training ===
Many MOL astronauts had hoped since childhood to travel into space. They only knew of the cover story that the program would be a space laboratory for military experiments, and did not learn of the reconnaissance role until after selection; they were advised to resign if they disliked the classified aspect. They received security clearances and were introduced to Sensitive Compartmented Information such as Dorian, Gambit, Talent (intelligence obtained from spy plane overflights) and Keyhole (intelligence obtained from satellites). Truly was amazed to learn that his country had not one but &quot;two space programs: the public, what the public knew and [NASA] astronauts and all that jazz, and then this other world of capability that didn&#x27;t exist&quot;.

Phase I of crew training was a two-month introduction to the MOL program in the form of a series of briefings from NASA and the contractors. Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, training flights, and sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input to them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions.

Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems: Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Zero-G training was conducted in a Boeing C-135 Stratolifter reduced-gravity aircraft. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking. NASA had pioneered neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid. The pilots were given scuba diving training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in Key West, Florida. Training was then conducted on a General Electric simulator on Buck Island, near Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at Howard Air Force Base in the Panama Canal Zone. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) in Washington, D.C.

== Planned operations ==
=== Reconnaissance ===
From the MOL&#x27;s regular orbit, the main camera had a circular field of view across, although at top magnification it was more like . This was much smaller than many of the targets that the NRO was interested in, such as air bases, shipyards and missile ranges. The astronauts would search for targets using the tracking and acquisition telescopes, which had a circular view about across, with a resolution of about . The main camera would focus on the most important targets, providing a very high resolution image. The aim was to have the most interesting part of the target in the center of the image; due to the optics used, the image would not be as sharp around the edges.

While surveillance targets were pre-programmed and the camera could operate automatically, astronauts could decide target priority for photographing. By avoiding cloudy areas and identifying more interesting subjects (an open missile silo instead of a closed one, for example), they would save film, the major limitation, since it had to be returned in the small Gemini B spacecraft. In cloudy areas like Moscow, it was estimated that the MOL would be 45 percent more efficient in its use of film than an automated satellite system through the ability to react to cloud cover, but for sunnier areas like the Tyuratam missile complex, this might be no more than 15 percent. The selective targeting afforded by human-guided surveillance would be more efficient than that obtained by robotic satellites. Of the 159 KH-7 Gambit photographs of the Tyuratam area, only 9 percent showed missiles on the launch pads, and of 77 photographs of missile silos, only 21 percent were with the doors open. The analysts identified 60 MOL targets in the complex. Only two or three could be photographed on each pass, but astronauts could select the most interesting ones, and photograph them with greater resolution than KH-7 Gambit.

The Air Force expected that an improved version of the MOL space station, known as Block II, expected to be available for the sixth crewed flight in July 1974, would add image transmission and geodetic system targeting. Astronauts would perform infrared, multispectral, and ultraviolet astronomy when they had time during an extended mission duration on twice-annual flights. After Block II, the MOL program managers hoped to build larger, permanent facilities. A planning document depicted 12-man and 40-man stations, both with self-defense capability. It described the 40-man, Y-shaped station as a &quot;spaceborne command post&quot; in synchronous orbit. With the &quot;key requirementpost attack survivability&quot;, the station would be capable of &quot;Strategic/tactical decision making&quot; during a general war.

=== Flight schedule ===
== Spacecraft ==
The Gemini spacecraft originated at NASA in 1961 as a development of the Mercury spacecraft, and was originally called Mercury Mark II. The name &quot;Gemini&quot; was chosen in recognition of its two-man crew. The NASA Gemini spacecraft was redesigned for the MOL and named Gemini B, although the NASA Gemini spacecraft was never referred to as Gemini A. The astronauts would fly into space in the Gemini B capsule, which would be launched together with the MOL modules atop a Titan IIIM launch vehicle. Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate and enter the laboratory module. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, power it up, separate it from the station, and perform reentry. Gemini B had an endurance of about 14 hours once detached from MOL.

Like the NASA Gemini, the Gemini B spacecraft would splash down in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans and be recovered by the same DoD spacecraft recovery forces used by NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini and Project Apollo. NASA had a paraglider under development to enable a Gemini spacecraft to paraglide to a dry-land touch-down, but was unable to get it working in time for Project Gemini missions. In March 1964, NASA attempted to get the USAF interested in using the paraglider with Gemini B, but after reviewing the troubled program, the USAF concluded that the paraglider still had too many problems to overcome, and it turned down the offer. The MOL laboratory module was intended to be used for a single mission only, with no provision for a later mission to dock and reuse it. Instead, its orbit would decay and it would be dumped in the ocean after 30 days.

Externally Gemini B was quite similar to its NASA twin, but there were many differences. The most noticeable was that it featured a rear hatch for the crew to enter the MOL space station. Notches were cut into the ejection seat headrests to allow access to the hatch. The seats were therefore mirror images of each other instead of being the same. Gemini B also had a larger diameter heat shield to handle the higher energy of reentry from a polar orbit. The number of reentry control system thrusters was increased from four to six. There was no orbit attitude and maneuvering system (OAMS), because capsule orientation for reentry was handled by the forward reentry control system thrusters, and the laboratory module had its own reaction control system for orientation.

The Gemini B systems were designed for long-term orbital storage (40 days), but equipment for long duration flights was removed since the Gemini B capsule itself was intended to be used only for launch and reentry. It had a different cockpit layout and instruments. As a result of the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, in which three NASA astronauts were killed in a ground test of their spacecraft, the MOL was switched to use a helium-oxygen atmosphere instead of a pure oxygen one. At takeoff, the astronauts would breathe pure oxygen in their spacesuits while the cabin was pressurized with helium. It would then be brought up to a helium-oxygen mix. This was an option that had been provided for in the original design.

Four Gemini B spacecraft were ordered from McDonnell, along with a boilerplate aerodynamically similar test article, at a cost of US$168.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). In November 1965, NASA agreed to hand over Gemini spacecraft No. 2 and Static Test Article No. 4 to the MOL program. Gemini spacecraft No. 2, which had flown in the 1965 Gemini 2 mission, was refurbished as a prototype Gemini B spacecraft.

== Space station ==
The hatch in the Gemini B spacecraft&#x27;s heat shield connected to a transfer tunnel that ran through the adaptor module. This contained the cryogenic hydrogen, helium and oxygen storage tanks, and housed the environmental control system, fuel cells, and four quad reaction control system thrusters and their propellant tanks. The transfer tunnel gave access to the laboratory module.

The purpose-built laboratory module was divided into two sections, but there was no partition between the two, and the crew could move freely between them. It was long and in diameter. Both were octagonal in shape, with eight bays. In the &quot;upper&quot; half (as it would have been on the launch pad), Bays 1 and 8 contained storage compartments; Bay 2, the environmental control system; Bay 3, the hygiene/waste compartment; Bay 4, the biochemical test console and work station; Bays 5 and 6, the airlock; and Bay 7, a glovebox for handling liquids; below that, a secondary food console. In the &quot;lower&quot; half, Bay 1 contained a motion chair that measured the mass of the crew; Bay 2, two performance test panels; Bay 3, the environmental control system controls; Bay 4, a physiology test console; Bay 5, an exercise device; Bay 6, two emergency oxygen masks; Bay 7, a view port and instrument panel; and Bay 8, the main spacecraft control station.

== Spacesuits ==
The MOL program&#x27;s requirements for a spacesuit were a product of the spacecraft design. The Gemini B capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made sets of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the intention was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the David Clark Company, International Latex Corporation, B. F. Goodrich and Hamilton Standard for design proposals in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.

A competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.

The contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for extravehicular activity (EVA). This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU) was developed and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a prototype without cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed.

== Facilities ==
=== Launch complex ===

The military director of the NRO, Brigadier General John L. Martin Jr., suggested that MOL launches be made from Cape Kennedy, as launches from the West Coast implied a polar orbit, which would lead to the assumption that the objective of the mission was reconnaissance. This was considered, but there were practical issues. MOL needed to be flown in a polar orbit, but a launch due south from Cape Kennedy would overfly southern Florida, which raised safety concerns. The TIROS weather satellites had performed a &quot;dog leg&quot; maneuver, flying east and then south to avoid southern Florida. This required special State Department approval, as it meant overflying Cuba. The loss of an MOL with a classified payload over Cuba would be not only a danger to life and property, but a serious security concern as well. Moreover, the dog leg maneuver would reduce the orbital payload by , reducing the equipment that could be carried or the duration of the mission or both. The cost of construction of a Titan III facility, including the purchase of the land, was estimated to be US$31 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and the required supporting ground equipment would cost another US$79 million (equivalent to $ million in ).
The announcement that the MOL would be launched from the Western Test Range caused an outcry in the Florida news media, which decried it as a wasteful duplication of facilities, given that the recently completed US$154 million (equivalent to $ million in ) Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41 was specifically built to handle Titan III launches. The Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Congressman George P. Miller from California, convened a special hearing on the MOL program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, Robert Seamans, supported the MOL program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the Senate before the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences on 24 February 1966, chaired by the influential Senator Clinton P. Anderson. This time the witnesses were Seamans, Flax and John S. Foster Jr., Brown&#x27;s successor as DDR&amp;E. The logic of the arguments and the united front presented dampened criticism, and none of the nine members of the House from Florida opposed the 1966 MOL budget allocation.

The USAF attempted to purchase the land to the south of Vandenberg Air Force Base for the new space launch complex from the owners, but negotiations failed to reach agreement on a suitable price. The government then went ahead and condemned the land under eminent domain, acquiring from the Sudden Ranch and from the Scolari Ranch for $9,002,500 (equivalent to $ in ). Ground was broken on the new Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) on 12 March 1966. Work on preparing the site was completed on 22 August. This involved of earthworks, and the construction of access roads, a water supply pipeline and a railroad siding.

By this time, the design of the launch complex had progressed to the point at which it was possible to call for bids for its construction. Major items included a launch pad, umbilical tower, mobile services tower, aerospace ground equipment building, propellant loading and storage systems, launch control center, segment receipt inspection building, ready building, protective clothing building, and complex service building. Seven bids for the construction contract were received, and it was awarded to the lowest bidder, Santa Fe and Stolte of Lancaster, California. The contract was valued at US$20.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Construction work was overseen by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The launch control center, segment receipt inspection building and ready building were accepted by the USAF in August 1968.

=== Easter Island ===
In the event of an abort, the Gemini B spacecraft could have come down in the eastern Pacific Ocean. To prepare for this contingency, an agreement was reached with Chile on 26 July 1968 for the use of Easter Island as a staging area for search and rescue aircraft and helicopters. Works included resurfacing the runway, taxiways and parking areas with asphalt, and establishing communications, aircraft maintenance and storage facilities, and accommodation for 100 personnel.

=== Rochester ===
A Camera Optical Assembly (COA) facility was constructed at Eastman Kodak in Rochester, New York. It included a new steel frame building and a masonry building with of test chambers, built at a cost of US$32,500,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The laboratory was dug into the ground so observers would not realize how large it was.

== Test flight ==
A MOL test flight was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 UTC, on a Titan IIIC, vehicle C-9. The flight consisted of an MOL mockup built from a Titan II propellant tank, and Gemini spacecraft No. 2, which had been refurbished as a prototype Gemini B spacecraft. This was the first time an American spacecraft intended for human spaceflight had flown in space twice, albeit without a crew. The adapter connecting the Gemini spacecraft to the laboratory mockup contained three other spacecraft: two OV4-1 satellites and an OV1-6 satellite. The Gemini B spacecraft separated for a suborbital reentry, while the MOL mockup continued into low Earth orbit, where it released the three satellites.

The simulated laboratory contained eleven experiments. The Manifold experimental package consisted of two micrometeoroid detection payloads, a transmitter beacon designated ORBIS-Low, a cell growth experiment, a prototype hydrogen fuel cell, a thermal control experiment, a propellent transfer and monitoring system to investigate fluid dynamics in zero gravity, a prototype attitude control system, an experiment to investigate the reflection of light in space, and an experiment into heat transfer. The spacecraft was painted to allow it to be used as a target for an optical tracking and observation experiment from the ground. Eight of the eleven experiments were successful.

The hatch installed in the Gemini&#x27;s heat shield to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations was tested during the capsule&#x27;s reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic by the after a flight of 33 minutes. The laboratory mockup entered an orbit with an apogee of , a perigee of , and 32.8 degrees of inclination. It remained in orbit until its orbital decay on 9 January 1967.

== Public response ==
With the 1966 Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament approaching, there were concerns about how the MOL was viewed by the international community. The United States insisted that the MOL was in line with the 17 October 1963 United Nations General Assembly resolution that the exploration and use of outer space should be used only &quot;for the betterment of mankind&quot;. To allay Soviet fears that the MOL would carry nuclear weapons, the State Department suggested that Soviet officials be permitted to inspect it for them before launch, but Brown opposed this on security grounds.

Public debate of the merits of the MOL program was hobbled by its semi-secret nature. Writing about the MOL as an outsider in 1967, Leonard E. Schwartz, a consultant to the Directorate for Scientific Affairs of the OECD, noted that the United States already had SAMOS satellites for reconnaissance and Vela satellites for surveillance of nuclear explosions, but without knowing their capabilities or those of MOL, could not evaluate the actual costs or benefits of the program.

Publicly, the Air Force vaguely described the MOL as &quot;an effective space building block of very substantial potential, a space resource capable of growth to follow-on tasks&quot;. &quot;On completion&quot;, Brady declared in 1965, &quot;we will have configured, acquired, and most important, conducted a manned military space operation thereby acquiring the crews, experience and equipment that will, if required, allow the Air Force to move into the near-earth space environment in an orderly and effective manner&quot;.

The Soviet Union commissioned the development of its own military space station, Almaz. This project was initiated by chief-designer Vladimir Chelomey on 12 October 1964, but it was Johnson&#x27;s announcement of the MOL program on 25 August 1965 that led to the Almaz project receiving official endorsement and funding on 27 October 1965. Three Almaz space stations flew as Salyut space stations between 1973 and 1976 before the crewed Almaz program was canceled in 1978.

== Delays and cost increases ==
Within weeks of Johnson&#x27;s announcement of the MOL program, it was facing budget cuts. In November 1965, Flax arbitrarily cut US$20 million (equivalent to $ in ) from the MOL program&#x27;s fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to US$374 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Brown learned that McNamara intended to limit the program to US$150 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in fiscal year 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the Vietnam War. In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970, on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, advising McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of US$294 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL program required was US$230 million (equivalent to $ million in ), which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and US$150 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was the sum requested in the budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.

When the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested US$205.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted at US$147.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ); Douglas wanted US$815.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at US$611.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ); and General Electric sought US$198 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for work budgeted at US$147.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December 1966, the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January 1967, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to US$430 million (equivalent to $ million in ), which was US$157 million (equivalent to $ million in ) short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and US$381 million (equivalent to $ million in ) below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated.
Budget cuts were not the only reason for the project&#x27;s schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April 1969, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970. Eventually, US$480 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was found for fiscal year 1968, with US$50 million (equivalent to $ million in ) obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and US$661 million (equivalent to $ million in ) agreed upon for fiscal year 1969. To accommodate this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.

On 17 May 1967, a US$674,703,744 FPIF contract (equivalent to $ in ) was signed with Douglas, which also received US$13 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in black budget funds. A US$180,469,000 FPIF contract (equivalent to $ in ) was signed with McDonnell the following day, and a US$110,020,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to General Electric, which was expected to receive another US$60 million in black budget funds (equivalent to $ million in ). The delays increased the projected costs of the MOL program to US$2.35 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ).

As MOL deputy director, Bleymaier in early 1968 asked his astronauts for advice. Aware of the program&#x27;s budgetary and political difficulties, they asked him to promise that the first launch would be fully operational. This would cancel two uncrewed qualification missions, the first in December 1970; the August 1971 crewed flight would be the first MOL launch and first operational mission. In March 1968, Congress appropriated US$515 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for fiscal year 1969, and the MOL SPO was directed to plan on the basis of a US$600 million appropriation (equivalent to $ million in ) for fiscal year 1970. This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.

== Usefulness of humans ==
A few months after MOL development began, the program began developing an automated MOL that replaced the crew compartment with film reentry vehicles. Human reconnaissance from space was tested on Gemini 5 in 1965, which conducted 17 USAF military experiments, including photographing missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, and observations of the White Sands Proving Ground. NPIC—which reviewed all NASA astronaut photographs of Earth before release—found that the Gemini photographs were not useful, lacking data on what the camera was aimed at. As automated technology improved, however, those within the MOL program increasingly feared that astronauts were being eliminated. Al Crews said &quot;it became obvious that all we were was a backup in case the unmanned reconnaissance system didn&#x27;t work&quot;. Although Crippen did not think automation could completely replace astronauts, he agreed with Crews that automation technology was rapidly improving.
In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans&#x27; usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May 1966, concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of the MOL versus a robotic version. Although it did not fly until July 1966, the authors were aware of the capabilities and limitations of the KH-8 Gambit 3. It could not achieve the same resolution as the Dorian camera on MOL, and the automation necessitated a longer development time and added weight, but the Dorian camera had a resolution of , could remain in orbit longer, and carry more film than earlier spy satellites.

The report&#x27;s authors concluded that the justification for manned MOL was stronger than they had believed. Crewed systems had many advantages over automated ones, which lost up to half their images to cloud cover on a typical mission. A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular orbit to a one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.

The authors believed that an uncrewed MOL would more likely fail early missions and slowly improve, while a crewed MOL would be &quot;self-healing&quot; and crews would not repeat mistakes. Experience on Projects Mercury, Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation were often the difference between the success and failure of the mission. Because of the early failures, they predicted that uncrewed MOL would always be less successful overall than crewed MOL regardless of the number of missions. After crewed MOL perfected the system, the program could fly both uncrewed and crewed missions, the report stated.

Debate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for MOL and KH-9 Hexagon, or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient. After the &quot;Liberty&quot; incident in June 1967 and the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, Richard M. Helms, commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. Whether the benefit justified the cost was unclear, but by 1968 USAF decided that the automated system&#x27;s longer development time and less certain capability meant that the first MOL missions required astronauts. Later ones could be crewed or automated as needed.

== Cancellation ==
On 20 January 1969, Richard Nixon was sworn in as president. He instructed the director of the new Bureau of the Budget, Robert Mayo, and the Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, to find ways to cut defense spending. The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; titled &quot;How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion&quot;, written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that &quot;receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities&quot;. MOL competed for funding with CIA&#x27;s Hexagon. While the goals of the two programs were different, they both used Titan III launchers and had comparably expensive budgets. NRO already had the much cheaper Gambit 3. The program was launching steadily improving satellites every two months, and ground resolution might be comparable to MOL by the latter&#x27;s first launch in 1972.

Stewart briefed the new Deputy Secretary of Defense, David Packard, on MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970 (equivalent to $ million in ). This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.
The Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird&#x27;s decision. Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was adequate, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. An MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million (equivalent to $ million in ), but a Gambit 3 launch cost only $23 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The value of VHR, Mayo argued, was not worth the extra cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduced the MOL&#x27;s funding to $360 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and canceled Hexagon.

Packard and CIA&#x27;s Helms asked the President to reverse the decision, arguing that Hexagon&#x27;s ability to photograph large areas was more important for arms control—which Nixon emphasized—than MOL&#x27;s high-resolution photographs of smaller areas. In May, a reconnaissance advisory panel led by Edwin Land recommended MOL&#x27;s cancellation and using Dorian&#x27;s technology in unmanned form. MOL&#x27;s reduction in funding meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be canceled. In a last ditch attempt to save MOL, Laird, Seamans, and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget&#x27;s recommendation to reverse his decision to cancel Hexagon and to cancel the MOL instead.

On 7 June 1969, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts. The official announcement that the MOL had been canceled was made on 10 June. One MOL astronaut heard the news on the radio while driving to work. Thousands of workers lost their jobs, including 500 at Kodak alone.

Had it flown as scheduled, MOL would have been the world&#x27;s first space station. Lew Allen, who worked in NRO and became a USAF general in the 1970s, thought that deciding to build an unmanned MOL resulted in design changes that caused the program&#x27;s cancellation. NRO director John McLucas wrote that MOL&#x27;s budget had become unacceptable, with &quot;little tangible to show for the $1.4 billion spent&quot;. Some believed that MOL should have launched astronauts before the optics were ready. Abrahamson later concurred that his and other MOL astronauts&#x27; advice to fly the first mission fully operational was a mistake. He learned while serving as Deputy Administrator of NASA in the early 1980s that launching anything, even &quot;an empty can&quot;, made cancellation of a project less likely. Al Crews believed that automated systems were probably superior, and said that when he saw high-resolution photographs from Gambit 3 he knew that MOL would be canceled. Allen, by 1981 Chief of Staff of the Air Force, reportedly said that year that human spaceflight was not useful. He had helped to cancel MOL and, the general said, he would have canceled the Space Shuttle program too. Although describing his training as a payload specialist for STS-62-A as &quot;the most exciting time of my life&quot;, Edward C. Aldridge, Jr.—NRO head during the mid-1980s—said in 2009 that MOL was canceled:
== Legacy ==
McLucas wrote that canceling MOL saved the government $1.5 billion over the following three years. NRO received some of the savings, and an official with the non-NRO Defense Support Program said that &quot;MOL saved our ass&quot;.

Following the cancellation, a committee was formed to handle the disposal of its assets, valued at US$12.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The Acquisition and Tracking System, Mission Development Simulator, Laboratory Module Simulator, and Mission Simulator were transferred to NASA by the end of 1973. The MOL Program Office at the Pentagon closed on 15 February 1970, and the office in Los Angeles on 30 September 1970. The Director of Space Systems, Brigadier General Allen, became the point of contact for contracts that were terminated, but those with Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas, and the United Technologies Corporation (UTC) were still open in June 1973. The Aerojet contract had only small claims totaling US$9,888 (), but there remained reservations of US$771,569 (equivalent to $ in ) on the McDonnell Douglas contract due to a subcontractor dispute and California franchise tax. The UTC contract was still worth up to US$51 million (equivalent to $ million in ), the actual amount depending on how much work was attributable to the MOL, and how much to the ongoing work on Titan III.
At the time the MOL was canceled, 192 service and 100 civilian personnel were employed on MOL activities. Within weeks, 80 percent of the service personnel were given new duty assignments. The civilians were reassigned to the Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO). The service personnel included fourteen of the seventeen MOL astronauts. Finley had returned to the U.S. Navy in April 1968, and Adams had left in July 1966 to join the X-15 program. He flew in space on his seventh flight on 15 November 1967, only to be killed when his aircraft broke up. Lawrence had died in an F-104 crash at Edwards Air Force Base on 8 December 1967. All the remaining fourteen except Herres wanted to transfer to NASA. Deke Slayton, NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations, believed that he did not need more astronauts. George Mueller, NASA Deputy Administrator, wanted to maintain good relations with the USAF. Slayton took the seven MOL pilots 35 or younger as NASA Astronaut Group 7; all flew on the Space Shuttle, starting with Crippen on STS-1. NASA also took Crews as a test pilot, and he would fly NASA aircraft until 1994. Due to their exposure to highly classified information, those who did not transfer to NASA could not engage in combat for three years because of the risk of capture. Not being able to serve in Vietnam hurt their careers, and some soon left the military.

The Titan III booster became a mainstay of the military satellite program. The Titan IIIC version was capable of lifting into low Earth orbit; its successor, the Titan IIID developed for Hexagon, could lift , and the Titan IIIM developed for the MOL would have been able to lift . NASA&#x27;s Saturn IB could lift , but the cost of a Titan IIIM launch was half that of Saturn IB. The Titan IIIM never flew, but the UA1207 solid rocket boosters developed for the MOL were eventually used on the Titan IV, and the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters were based on materials, processes, and the UA1207 design developed for MOL, with only minor changes. NASA also used work on the Gemini B spacesuits for the agency&#x27;s own suits, MOL&#x27;s waste management system flew on Skylab, and NASA Earth Science used other MOL equipment. The prototype IMLSS is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Gambit 3&#x27;s resolution did eventually become comparable to Dorian&#x27;s, in part using optics technology developed for Dorian. The Hubble Space Telescope, and KH-11 Kennen satellites that NRO began developing in 1971, also used the technology; by the 1980s Kennen reached Dorian&#x27;s resolution or better. While no unmanned satellite used Dorian&#x27;s own optics, mirrors had been ordered early in the program and were almost complete. Six honeycombed borosilicate glass mirrors made by Corning for MOL, each with a diameter of , were combined to make the Multiple Mirror Telescope in Arizona, the third largest optical telescope in the world at the time of its dedication.
At the time of cancellation, work on Space Launch Complex 6 was 92 percent complete. The main task remaining was conducting acceptance tests. It was decided to complete the construction and tests, but not install the aerospace ground equipment, and then place the facility in caretaker status, with a caretaker crew provided by the 6595th Aerospace Test Wing. In 1972, the USAF decided to refurbish SLC-6 for use with the Space Shuttle. This cost more than anticipated, some US$2.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), and the date of the first launch had to be postponed from June 1984 to July 1986. The airport runway at Easter Island developed for MOL was extended by another to to allow for an emergency Space Shuttle landing and a piggyback retrieval by a modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, at a cost of US$7.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Preparations were underway for STS-62-A, the launch of the from SLC-6, commanded by MOL astronaut Bob Crippen and Aldridge aboard, when the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster occurred in January 1986. Plans for Space Shuttle launches from SLC-6 were abandoned, and none ever flew from there. No Space Shuttle was ever launched into a polar orbit. From 2006 to 2022, SLC-6 was used for Delta IV launches, including NRO KH-11 Kennan satellites. Currently, the launch site is getting converted by SpaceX to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches starting in 2025.

Some items of MOL equipment made their way to museums. The Gemini B spacecraft used in the only flight of the MOL program is on display at the Air Force Space and Missile Museum at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A Gemini B spacecraft used for ground-based testing is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, (on loan from the National Air and Space Museum). Like the other Gemini B spacecraft, it is differentiated from the NASA Gemini spacecraft by the words &quot;U.S. AIR FORCE&quot; painted on it, with accompanying insignia, and by the circular hatch cut through its heat shield. Two MH-7 training spacesuits from the MOL program were discovered in a locked room in the Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 5 museum on Cape Canaveral in 2005. Crippen donated his MOL spacesuit to the National Air and Space Museum in 2017.

In July 2015, the NRO declassified over eight hundred files and photos related to the MOL program. A book by the Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance oral historian Courtney V.K. Homer about the MOL program, &quot;Spies in Space&quot; (2019), was based on documents released by the NRO and interviews she conducted with Abrahamson, Bobko, Crippen, Crews, Macleay, and Truly.

<text>James Robert Bruce Ogilvy (born 29 February 1964) is a British landscape designer, and the founder and editor of the magazine &quot;Luxury Briefing&quot;. He is a member of the extended British royal family as the elder child and only son of Princess Alexandra of Kent and Sir Angus Ogilvy. Queen Elizabeth II was a first cousin of his mother, both of whom were granddaughters of King George V. As a result, he is a second cousin of King Charles III and 59th in the line to the British throne.

==Early life and family==
Ogilvy was born in Thatched House Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey. He was the first of four children born to royalty within a space of nine weeks in 1964, the others being Prince Edward, Lady Helen Windsor and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones. Ogilvy was baptised by Arthur Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, with Queen Elizabeth II among his seven godparents. At birth, he was 13th in line to the British throne. As of January 2025, he is 58th.

==Education and professional life==
His education began in the &quot;palace school&quot; with his cousins Prince Edward, Lady Helen Windsor and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones. Subsequently, Ogilvy attended Gibbs pre-prep and Heatherdown Preparatory School (with Prince Edward). After that, Ogilvy and Prince Edward went separate ways, the prince to Gordonstoun and Cambridge, and Ogilvy to Eton College and the University of St Andrews. From St. Andrews, he earned a Scottish Master of Arts degree in History of art. He then attended the full-time MBA course at Cranfield from 1990 to 1991, obtaining the MBA qualification.

He worked for Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) and then a shipping agency in Edinburgh.

He is the publisher and founder of &quot;Luxury Briefing&quot;, a magazine launched in 1996, and has served on numerous boards of directors.

Ogilvy is also a professional photographer and landscape designer.

==Personal life==
He married Julia Caroline Rawlinson, daughter of Charles Frederick Melville Rawlinson, of Arkesden, Essex, a merchant banker, on 30 July 1988 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Saffron Walden, Essex. The couple have two children:
* Flora Alexandra Vesterberg (born 15 December 1994 in Edinburgh, Scotland) who studied History of Art at the University of Bristol and has a master&#x27;s degree from the Courtauld Institute of Art: she runs a contemporary art agency. She married Swedish financier Timothy Vesterberg at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, on 26 September 2020 and renewed their vows the following year.
* Alexander Charles Ogilvy (born 12 November 1996 in Edinburgh, Scotland) who attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

He is also a godfather of Princess Eugenie, the younger daughter of his second cousin, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York.

In 1997, while on holiday in Florida with his wife and children, he swam out into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Ogilvy had several leg wounds and required 30 stitches.

==Ancestry==
His maternal grandparents were Prince George, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of King George V; and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. Princess Marina was the daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia (later known as Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark). He has a younger sister, Marina Ogilvy.

==Honours==
* 6 February 1977: Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal
* 6 February 2002: Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal
* 6 February 2012: Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal
* 6 February 2022: Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal

<text>James Robert Sutton (born 7 November 1941), generally known as Jim Sutton, is a New Zealand politician who was a Member of Parliament between 1984 and 1990 and again between 1993 and 2006. He has held a range of ministerial portfolios including Agriculture, Forestry, Rural Affairs, Biosecurity, and Trade Negotiations.

==Biography==
Sutton was born in Reading, Berkshire, England. He came to New Zealand while young, arriving in 1949. He attended Timaru Boys&#x27; High School before becoming a farmer. Sutton is married, and has three children.

He has held a number of offices in Federated Farmers, a nationwide agricultural association. He was also Director of Trustbank South Canterbury, chaired the New Zealand Aids Foundation, served as a board member of the Public Health Commission, and was deputy chair of both the New Zealand Lotteries Commission and Meridian Energy. His brother Bill Sutton has also been a Labour MP.

==Honours and awards==
Sutton was appointed as a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the New Year Honours List 2007 for &quot;public services as a member of parliament and Minister of the Crown&quot;.

==Member of Parliament==




Sutton first stood for parliament in the election of 1981, becoming the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the Waitaki electorate. He was unsuccessful against National&#x27;s Jonathan Elworthy. In the 1984 election, however, he stood again, and won the electorate. Most rural electorates in New Zealand traditionally support the National Party, and so Sutton&#x27;s victory as a Labour candidate was noteworthy.

Sutton retained his electorate in the 1987 general election, but was defeated in the election of 1990. He returned to farming for three years before being returned to Parliament as the MP for Timaru in the 1993 general election. The switch to the MMP electoral system caused significant redistribution of electorates for the 1996 general election, and Sutton became the MP for Aoraki, which included both of his former electorates.

===Ministerial role===
Sutton&#x27;s first ministerial role had come in the dying days of the Fourth Labour Government, shortly before he lost the Waitaki electorate. He served as Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Forestry for most of 1990, leaving cabinet when Labour was defeated in that year&#x27;s election. However, when Labour won the 1999 general election, Sutton became a minister once again in the Fifth Labour Government. He resumed his Agriculture portfolio while also becoming Minister for Rural Affairs and Minister for Trade Negotiations. In 2001, he gained the Biosecurity portfolio, and in 2002, he regained the Forestry portfolio. In the December 2004 cabinet reshuffle he dropped the Forestry portfolio and for Rural Affairs became Associate Minister.

===Retirement from politics===
In the 2005 general election, Sutton lost his electorate by a substantial margin, facing the biggest drop in support in any electorate. This has been attributed to anger over things such as school closures, and his role in the &quot;speeding motorcade&quot; affair. He remained in parliament as a list MP, but announced his retirement from politics on 10 July 2006, effective from 1 August 2006. He was replaced from the Labour list by Charles Chauvel.

Sutton subsequently became Ambassador for Trade and the chairman of Landcorp, an appointment renewed by the National government in 2009.

<text>Jerome F. Lederer (September 26, 1902 – February 6, 2004) was an American aviation-safety pioneer, known as &quot;Mr. Aviation Safety.&quot;
He was born in New York City. He received a BSC in mechanical engineering with aeronautical options in 1924 and an M.E. in 1925 from New York University. In 1926, he was hired by the United States Postal Service to oversee its plane maintenance. Lederer helped reduce pilot fatality by devising film crash tests and redesigning the exhaust stacks and other systems. From 1929 to 1940, he served as chief engineer for aviation insurance underwriters. In 1940, he accepted an appointment as director of the Civil Aeronautics Board&#x27;s Safety Bureau. He resigned in 1942 to become director of the Airlines War Training Institute. He trained 10,000 airmen and 35,000 mechanics for the Air Transport Command, and was a safety consultant to the 2nd Air Force.

In 1947, he organized the Flight Safety Foundation and was its director until 1967. The Foundation provides global exchange of information on aircraft accident prevention. In 1967, following the deaths of three astronauts at the Kennedy Space Center, NASA appointed him director of the Office of Manned Space Flight Safety for the Apollo Program. In 1970, he became director of safety for all of NASA.

In 1987, Lederer was the recipient of the &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. He died of congestive heart failure in Laguna Hills, California, at the age of 101.

Lederer was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Trivia==
He inspected the Spirit of St. Louis before Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight. &quot;I did not have too much hope that he would make it,&quot; he admitted years later. &quot;I just went out because I was a friend of his, and I wanted to see the airplane, to look the situation over.&quot;

The International Society of Air Safety Investigators yearly awards the Jerome F Lederer Award for &quot;outstanding contributions to technical excellence in accident investigation.&quot;

The Flight Safety Foundation &quot;Jerome F. Lederer Safety Leadership Medal&quot; recognizes an individual or team for making a significant contribution to the advancement of civil aviation safety.

<doc id="615382" wikidata="Q128652" url="?curid=615382" title="Palace of Justice, Nuremberg">
<text>The Nuremberg Palace of Justice () is a building complex in Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany. It was constructed from 1909 to 1916 and houses the appellate court (&quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot;), the regional court (&quot;Landgericht&quot;), the local court (&quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) and the public prosecutor&#x27;s office (&quot;Staatsanwaltschaft&quot;). The Nuremberg Trials Memorial (&quot;Memorium Nürnberger Prozesse&quot;) is located on the top floor of the courthouse. The International Nuremberg Principles Academy is housed on the ground floor of the east wing since 2020.

==Nuremberg Trials==
The building was chosen as the location of the Nuremberg trials (19451949) for the main surviving German war criminals of World War II because it was almost undamaged, was large enough, and included a large prison complex. The choice of the city of Nuremberg was symbolic as the Nazi Party had held its large Nuremberg rallies in the city.

The trials took place in courtroom number 600, situated in the east wing of the palace of Justice. The courtroom was used until 1 March 2020, especially for murder trials. At the end of the Nuremberg Trials the courtroom was refurbished, and is now smaller. A wall that had been removed during the trials to create more space was re-erected. In addition, the judges&#x27; bench was turned 90 degrees and is no longer situated in front of the window, but stands where the witness box was placed during the trials.

From the year 2000, courtroom 600 could be visited by tourists, during weekends. It was still used for court hearings until 1 March 2020. Since the completion of the new criminal justice centre on the west side of the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, the criminal trials of the large criminal chambers of the Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court have been held there in a total of seven modern courtrooms.

In December 2008, the courtroom was closed to the public due to construction works creating a permanent exhibition. The &quot;Nuremberg Trials Memorial&quot; hosted by the Nuremberg Municipal Museums was opened in November 2010. Since 2022, a media installation creates a virtual illusion of the courtroom at the time of the Nuremberg Trials.

<doc id="615385" wikidata="Q332944" url="?curid=615385" title="Gate valve">
<text>A gate valve, also known as a sluice valve, is a valve that opens by lifting a barrier (gate) out of the path of the fluid. Gate valves require very little space along the pipe axis and hardly restrict the flow of fluid when the gate is fully opened. The gate faces can be parallel but are most commonly wedge-shaped (in order to be able to apply pressure on the sealing surface).

==Typical use==
Gate valves are used to shut off the flow of liquids rather than for flow regulation, which is frequently done with a globe valve. When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low flow resistance. The size of the open flow path generally varies in a nonlinear manner as the gate is moved. This means that the flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Depending on the construction, a partially open gate can vibrate from the fluid flow.

Gate valves are mostly used with larger pipe diameters (from 2&quot; to the largest pipelines) since they are less complex to construct than other types of valves in large sizes.
At high pressures, friction can become a problem. As the gate is pushed against its guiding rail by the pressure of the medium, it becomes harder to operate the valve. Large gate valves are sometimes fitted with a bypass controlled by a smaller valve to be able to reduce the pressure before operating the gate valve itself.

Gate valves without an extra sealing ring on the gate or the seat are used in applications where minor leaking of the valve is not an issue, such as heating circuits or sewer pipes.

==Valve construction==

Common gate valves are actuated by a threaded stem that connects the actuator (e.g. handwheel or motor) to the gate. They are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem, depending on which end of the stem is threaded. Rising stems are fixed to the gate and rise and lower together as the valve is operated, providing a visual indication of valve position. The actuator is attached to a nut that is rotated around the threaded stem to move it. Nonrising stem valves are fixed to, and rotate with, the actuator, and are threaded into the gate. They may have a pointer threaded onto the stem to indicate valve position, since the gate&#x27;s motion is concealed inside the valve. Nonrising stems are used where vertical space is limited.

Gate valves may have flanged ends drilled according to pipeline-compatible flange dimensional standards. 

Gate valves are typically constructed from cast iron, cast carbon steel, ductile iron, gunmetal, stainless steel, alloy steels, and forged steels.

All-metal gate valves are used in ultra-high vacuum chambers to isolate regions of the chamber.

===Bonnet===
Bonnets provide leakproof closure for the valve body. Gate valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. A screw-in bonnet is the simplest, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. A union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection and cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A bolted bonnet is used for larger valves and higher pressure applications.

====Pressure seal bonnet====
Another type of bonnet construction in a gate valve is pressure seal bonnet. This construction is adopted for valves for high pressure service, typically in excess of 2250 psi (15 MPa). The unique feature of the pressure seal bonnet is that the bonnet ends in a downward-facing cup that fits inside the body of the valve. As the internal pressure in the valve increases, the sides of the cup are forced outward. improving the body-bonnet seal. Other constructions where the seal is provided by external clamping pressure tend to create leaks in the body-bonnet joint.

====Knife gate valve====
For plastic solids and high-viscosity slurries such as paper pulp, a specialty valve known as a knife gate valve is used to cut through the material to stop the flow. A knife gate valve is usually not wedge shaped and has a tapered knife-like edge on its lower surface.

<doc id="615390" wikidata="Q864893" url="?curid=615390" title="Pied bush chat">
<text>The pied bush chat (Saxicola caprata) is a small passerine bird found ranging from West Asia and Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. About sixteen subspecies are recognized through its wide range with many island forms. It is a familiar bird of countryside and open scrub or grassland where it is found perched at the top of short thorn trees or other shrubs, looking out for insect prey. They pick up insects mainly from the ground, and were, like other chats, placed in the thrush family Turdidae, but are now considered as Old World flycatchers.

They nest in cavities in stone walls or in holes in an embankment, lining the nest with grass and animal hair. The males are black with white shoulder and vent patches whose extent varies among populations. Females are predominantly brownish while juveniles are speckled.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the pied bush chat in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected from the island of Luzon in the Philippines. He used the French name &quot;Le traquet de l&#x27;Isle de Luçon&quot; and the Latin &quot;Rubetra Lucionensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the pied bush chat. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla caprata&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific epithet &quot;caprata&quot; is from a local name in Luzon which according to Brisson was &quot;Maria-capra&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Saxicola&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802. There are 16 recognised subspecies.

==Description==
At , the pied bush chat is slightly smaller than the Siberian stonechat, &quot;Saxicola maurus&quot;, although it has a similar dumpy structure and upright stance. The male is black except for a white rump, wing patch and lower belly. The iris is dark brown, the bill and legs black. The female is drab brown and slightly streaked. Juveniles have a scaly appearance on the underside but dark above like the females.

A number of geographic populations have been given subspecies status:

This species is closely related to the European-African stonechat complex. &quot;S. c. fruticola&quot; from Indonesia (Moyo Island population appeared to be well differentiated from specimens from Lembata Island with a divergence estimated to about 360,000 years ago.), &quot;S. c. pyrrhonota&quot; from West Timor (Indonesia).

Local names include &quot;Kala pidda&quot; in Hindi &quot;Shyama&quot; in Gujarati &quot;Kavda gapidda&quot; in Marathi &quot;Kallu kuruvi&quot; in Tamil, &quot;Kampa nalanchi&quot; in Telugu. The Fore people of New Guinea called it &quot;pobogile&quot;. They were once popular in Bengal as cage birds. They are still found in the local bird trade of some parts of Southeast Asia.

==Distribution==
The pied bush chat is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from the Greater Middle East through the Indian subcontinent eastwards to Indonesia. They colonized Papua New Guinea around 1950. It is found in open habitats including scrub, grassland and cultivation.

Some populations are partially migratory. A ringed individual of subspecies &quot;rossorum&quot; has been recovered from Israel. The populations in India also appear to show seasonal movements but the patterns are unclear. Subspecies &quot;bicolor&quot; is found in peninsular India in winter. In Karwar on the western coast, it is said to appear in October and stay till May but not seen during the rainy season. Said to be absent in the Baroda district of Gujarat from April to September. Claud Buchanan Ticehurst noted that it was a summer visitor to Baluchistan leaving in October and further that the birds from Baluchistan were indistinguishable from &quot;rossorum&quot; of Turkestan.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The breeding season is mainly February to August with a peak in March to June. Males sing from prominent perches. The whistling call is somewhat like that of an Indian robin and has been transcribed as &quot;we are tea for two&quot; with &quot;tea&quot; at higher note. The nest is built in a hole in a wall or similar site lined with grass and hair, and two to five eggs are laid. Paired males did not reduce their dawn singing behaviour when their mates were trapped and temporarily excluded from the territory. This study suggests that males use dawn chorus to mediate social relationships with neighbouring males to proclaim an established territory. The eggs are small and broadly oval with pale bluish-white or pinkish ground colour and speckles and blotches towards the broad end. They measure about . Eggs are incubated chiefly by the female for 12 to 13 days.

Brood parasitism by the common cuckoo (race &quot;bakeri&quot;) has been noted to be common in the Shan State of Burma, with the cuckoo visiting the nest at dusk and removing an egg before quickly laying its own.
The female has dark brown upperparts and rufous underparts and rump. She has no white wing patches. Juveniles are similar to females. Males display during the breeding season by splaying the tail, fluttering and puffing up the white scapular feathers.

This species is insectivorous, and like other chats hunts from a prominent low perch. They have been noted to feed on Pyralid moths and whitefly.

Nematode parasites in the genus &quot;Acuaria&quot; have been noted. Adult birds have few predators although bats (&quot;Megaderma lyra&quot;) and wintering &quot;Asio flammeus&quot; have been noted to prey on them.

==In culture==
Among the Toda people in the Nilgiris, the pied bushchat or kāŗpiłc, is a bird of omen and the origin of its white wing patches is described in a story of a dairy priest &quot;Piu.f&quot; who in the ritual of churning milk forgot to remove the churning stick before fetching water from a stream. The bird attempted to obstruct him by blocking his path but he disregarded it and flicked off butter from his hands. The white spots remained but &quot;Piu.f&quot; met his death. The Kotas of the Nilgiris have an origin story to explain the sexual dimorphism of the pied bushchat but they consider the &quot;karyvaky&quot; bird to be one that foretells good omen. The Kalam people of Papua New Guinea consider the birds as divine messengers.

<doc id="615393" wikidata="Q1039527" url="?curid=615393" title="KH-11 KENNEN">
<text>The KH-11 KENNEN (later renamed CRYSTAL, then Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System, and codenamed 1010 and Key Hole) is a type of reconnaissance satellite first launched by the American National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in December 1976. Manufactured by Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California, the KH-11 was the first American spy satellite to use electro-optical digital imaging, and so offer real-time optical observations.

Later KH-11 satellites have been referred to by outside observers as KH-11B or KH-12, and by the names &quot;Advanced KENNEN&quot;, &quot;Improved Crystal&quot; and &quot;Ikon&quot;. Official budget documents refer to the latest generation of electro-optical satellites as &quot;Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System&quot;. The Key Hole series was officially discontinued in favor of a random numbering scheme after repeated public references to KH-7 GAMBIT, KH-8 GAMBIT 3, KH-9 HEXAGON, and KH-11 KENNEN satellites.

The capabilities of the KH-11 are highly classified, as are the images they produce. The satellites are believed to have been the source of some imagery of the Soviet Union and China made public in 1997; images of Sudan and Afghanistan made public in 1998 related to the response to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings; and a 2019 photo, provided by then President Donald Trump, of a failed Iranian rocket launch.

== Program history and logistics ==
Before KENNEN, National Reconnaissance Office spy satellites like KH-9 HEXAGON returned film photographs to Earth in capsules. Although film is a very effective way to photograph much territory at high resolution, when satellites ran out of film or capsules they became useless. The Film Read-Out KH-7 GAMBIT (FROG) served as NRO Program A&#x27;s competitor to NRO Program B&#x27;s initial electro-optical imagery (EOI) satellite. After a precursor EOI study with the codeword Zoster, President Nixon on 23 September 1971 approved the development of an EOI satellite under the initial codeword Zaman. In November 1971, this codeword was changed to Kennen, which is Middle English for &quot;to perceive&quot;. Initial director of the ZAMAN/KENNEN Program Group was Charles R. &quot;Charlie&quot; Roth, who in Oct 1975 was succeeded by Rutledge P. (Hap) Hazzard.

Data is transmitted through a network of communications satellites; the Satellite Data System (SDS). The initial ground station for the processing of the digital imaging was a secret National Reconnaissance Office facility in Area 58, later confirmed to be located in Fort Belvoir in Virginia.

In 1999, NRO selected Boeing as the prime contractor for the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program, aimed at replacing the KH-11 satellites by a more cost effective constellation of smaller, and also more capable reconnaissance satellites. After the failure of the FIA in 2005, NRO ordered from Lockheed two additional legacy hardware KH-11s. USA-224, the first of these, was launched in early 2011 two years ahead of the initial schedule estimate.

== Design ==

=== Initial design specifications ===
According to Lew Allen, the initial key design elements were specified by Edwin H. Land. They included i) solid state focal plane array, ii) integrated circuits for complex data processing, iii) large, fast optics with a diameter f/2 primary mirror, iv) gigabit/s data link, v) long on-orbit operational lifetime for the imaging satellites, and vi) communication satellites to facilitate close-to-realtime downlink of the images.

=== Size and mass ===
KH-11s are believed to resemble the Hubble Space Telescope in size and shape, as they were shipped in similar containers. Their length is believed to be 19.5 meters, with a diameter of up to . A NASA history of the Hubble, in discussing the reasons for switching from a 3-meter main mirror to a design, states: &quot;In addition, changing to a 2.4-meter mirror would lessen fabrication costs by using manufacturing technologies developed for military spy satellites&quot;.

Different versions of the KH-11 vary in mass. Early KH-11s were reported to be comparable in mass to HEXAGON, i.e. about . Later blocks are believed to have a mass of around to .

=== Propulsion module ===
It has been reported that KH-11s are equipped with a hydrazine-powered propulsion system for orbital adjustments. In order to increase the orbital lifetime of KH-11s, plans existed for refuelling the propulsion module during service visits by the Space Shuttle. It has been speculated that the propulsion module is related to Lockheed&#x27;s Satellite Support Bus (SSB), which had been derived from the Satellite Control Section (SCS) developed by Lockheed for KH-9.

=== Optical Telescope Assembly ===
A CIA history states that the primary mirror on the first KH-11s measured , but sizes increased in later versions. NRO led the development of a computer controlled mirror polishing technique, which was subsequently also used for the polishing of the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope.

Later satellites had larger mirrors, with a diameter of around . &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; indicates that the secondary mirror in the Cassegrain reflecting telescope system could be moved, allowing images to be taken from angles unusual for a satellite. Also, there are indications that the satellite can take images every five seconds.

=== Imaging sensors and camera modes ===
The initial KH-11 camera system offered frame and strip modes. The focal plane was equipped with an array of light-sensitive silicon diodes, which converted brightness values to electrical signals. The packaging density was sufficiently high (several hundred diodes per inch) to match the ground sample distance of the CORONA satellites. The recorded digital signal was encrypted and transmitted to a ground station in near real time, and written to film by means of a laser in order to recreate the recorded image. The first charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors for KH-11 were developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation at their Baltimore facility in the later 1970s. KH-11 Block II might have been the first reconnaissance satellite equipped for imaging with an CCD. Later block satellites may include signals intelligence capabilities and greater sensitivity in broader light spectrums (probably into infrared).

=== Communications ===
Communication to and data downloads from KH-11 satellites are routed through a constellation of communication relay satellites in higher orbits. The initial communications relay payload is believed to have operated at a frequency of 60 GHz, as radio emission at this frequency is blocked by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and thus not detectable from the ground. Launch of the initial two Satellite Data System satellites occurred in June and August 1976, i.e. ahead of the first launch of a KH-11 satellite in late 1976. 
One of the initial on-orbit challenges were failures of the Traveling-wave tubes, which did amplify the communications signals sent from the imaging satellite to the relay satellites, and from the relay satellites to the ground stations. During crossings of the ionosphere, ions could built-up on the outside of the tubes, which were operated at 14,000 volt. This resulted in repeated sparking, and depositing of carbon traces inside the tubes, ultimately shorting them out. The issue could be abated by changing the orbiting satellite&#x27;s orientation during crossing of the ionosphere, and was finally solved by better shielding of the tubes in follow-up satellites.
Ground stations for the receipt of KH-11 data have been reported to be located in Fort Belvoir, VA, the former Buckley Air National Guard Base, CO, and Kapaun Air Station, Germany.

=== Resolution and ground sample distance ===
A perfect mirror observing in the visual spectrum (i.e. at a wavelength of 500 nm) has a diffraction limited resolution of around 0.05 arcsec, which from an orbital altitude of corresponds to a ground sample distance of . Operational resolution should be worse due to effects of the atmospheric turbulence. Astronomer Clifford Stoll estimates that such a telescope could resolve up to &quot;a couple inches. Not quite good enough to recognize a face&quot;.

=== KH-11 generations===
Five generations of U.S. electro-optical reconnaissance have been identified:

==== Block I ====
Block I refer to the original KH-11 satellite, of which five were launched between 19 December 1976 and 17 November 1982.

==== Block II ====
The three Block II satellites are in the open literature referred to as KH-11B, the alleged &quot;DRAGON&quot; codename, or &quot;CRYSTAL&quot;, and are believed to be capable of taking infrared images in addition to optical observations. The first or second Block II satellite was lost in a launch failure.

==== Block III ====
Four Block III satellites, commonly called KH-12 or &quot;Improved CRYSTAL&quot; were launched between November 1992 and October 2001. The name &quot;Improved CRYSTAL&quot; refers to the &quot;Improved Metric CRYSTAL System&quot; (IMCS). &quot;Metric&quot; describes the capability to fix Datum references (markings) in an image relative to the World Geodetic System for mapping purposes. Another improvement was an eightfold increase in the download rate compared to earlier models to facilitate improved real-time access and increased area coverage. From Block III on, the typical lifetime of the satellites increased to about 15 years, possibly related to a higher lift-off mass, which facilitates larger fuel reserves for countering atmospheric drag.

==== Block IV ====
Three electro-optical satellites launched in October 2005, January 2011, and August 2013 are attributed to Block IV.

==== Block V ====
A new generation of clandestine communications satellites launched to inclined geosynchronous orbits have led to speculations that these are in support of Block V electro-optical satellites scheduled for launch in late 2018 (NROL-71) and 2021 (NROL-82). The two satellites have been built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, have a primary mirror with a diameter of 2.4 meters, and are evolutionary upgrades to the previous blocks built by Lockheed.

Based on the published hazard areas for the launch, an orbital inclination of 74° has been deduced for NROL-71. This could indicate that NROL-71 is targeted for a Type II Multi Sun-Synchronous Orbit, which would enable the satellite to study the ground at a range of local hour effects (shadow direction and length, daily activities, etc.).

== Derivatives ==
The &quot;Misty&quot; satellite is believed to have been derived from the KH-11, but modified to make it invisible to radar, and hard to detect visually. The first Misty satellite, USA-53, was released by the on mission STS-36 in 1990. The USA-144 satellite, launched on 22 May 1999 by a Titan IVB from Vandenberg Air Force Base may have been a second Misty satellite, or an Enhanced Imaging System spacecraft. The satellites are sometimes identified as KH-12s.

In January 2011, NRO donated to NASA two space Optical Telescope Assemblies with diameter primary mirrors, similar in size to the Hubble Space Telescope, yet with steerable secondary mirrors and shorter focal length (resulting in a wider field of view). These were initially believed to be KH-11 series &quot;extra hardware&quot;, but were later attributed to the cancelled Future Imaging Architecture program. The mirrors are to be used by NASA as the primary and spare for the Roman Space Telescope.

== Compromises ==

In 1978, a young CIA employee named William Kampiles was accused of selling a KH-11 System Technical Manual describing design and operation to the Soviets. Kampiles was convicted of espionage and initially sentenced to 40 years in prison. Later, this term was reduced, and after serving 18 years, Kampiles was released in 1996.

In 1984 Samuel Loring Morison, an intelligence analyst at the Naval Intelligence Support Center, forwarded three classified images taken by KH-11 to the publication &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;. In 1985, Morison was convicted in Federal Court on two counts of espionage and two counts of theft of government property, and was sentenced to two years in prison. He was pardoned by President Clinton in 2001.

In 2019 Donald Trump, as President of the United States, tweeted a classified image of the aftermath of a failed test of Iran&#x27;s Safir rocket, which some believe was taken from the USA-224 satellite.

In Seymour Hersh&#x27;s book &quot;The Samson Option: Israel&#x27;s Nuclear Arsenal &amp; American Foreign Policy&quot; Ari Ben-Menashe says that Israel had stolen images from the KH-11 in order to target missiles at the Soviet Union.

== KH-11 missions ==
Nine KH-11 satellites were launched between 1976 and 1990 aboard Titan-3D and Titan-34D launch vehicles, with one launch failure. For the following five satellite launches between 1992 and 2005, a Titan IV launch vehicle was used. The three most recent launches since 2011 were carried out by Delta IV Heavy launch vehicles. The KH-11 replaced the KH-9 film return satellite, among others, the last of which was lost in a liftoff explosion in 1986.

All KH-11 satellites are in either of two standard planes in Sun-synchronous orbits. As shadows help to discern ground features, satellites in a standard plane east of a noon/midnight orbit observe the ground at local afternoon hours, while satellites in a western plane observe the ground at local morning hours. Historically launches have therefore been timed to occur either about two hours before or one hour after local noon (or midnight), respectively. The orbits are such that ground-tracks repeat after a certain number of days, currently each four days for the primary satellites in the East and West orbital plane.

The constellation consists of two primary and two secondary satellites (one primary and one secondary per plane). The orbital planes of the two primary satellites in the East and West plane are separated by 48° to 50°. The orbital plane of the secondary satellite in the East plane is located 20° to the east of the primary satellite, while the orbital plane of the secondary satellite in the West plane is located 10° to the west of the primary satellite.

KH-11 satellites require periodic reboosts to counter atmospheric drag, or to adjust their ground track to surveillance requirements. Based on data collected by amateur observers, the following orbital characteristics of OPS 5705 were calculated by amateur skywatcher Ted Molczan.

On 4 September 2010, amateur astrophotographer Ralf Vandebergh took some pictures of a KH-11 (USA-129) satellite from the ground. The pictures, despite being taken with a aperture telescope from a range of , show major details such as dishes and solar panels, as well as some elements whose function is not known.

== Cost ==
Estimated unit costs, including launch and in dollars, range from tobillion (inflation adjusted tobillion in ).

According to US Senator Kit Bond initial budget estimates for each of the two legacy KH-11 satellites ordered from Lockheed in were higher than for the latest &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier (CVN-77) with its projected procurement cost of billion as of May. In , after the launch of USA-224, DNRO Bruce Carlson announced that the procurement cost for the satellite had been billion under the initial budget estimate, which would put it at about billion (inflation adjusted billion in ).

In April , the NRO assigned a &quot;worth more than billion&quot; to the final two legacy KH-11 satellites.

<text>Robert David Putnam (born January 9, 1941) is an American political scientist specializing in comparative politics. He is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government. 

Putnam developed the influential two-level game theory that assumes international agreements will only be successfully brokered if they also result in domestic benefits. His most famous work, &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, argues that the United States has undergone an unprecedented collapse in civic, social, associational, and political life (social capital) since the 1960s, with serious negative consequences. In March 2015, he published a book called &quot;Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis&quot; that looked at issues of inequality of opportunity in the United States. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Putnam is the fourth most frequently cited author on college syllabi for political science courses.

&quot;Join or Die&quot;, a 2023 documentary film about community connections and club participation that is available on Netflix, features Putnam and is based on Putnam&#x27;s works.

==Life and career==
Robert David Putnam was born on January 9, 1941, in Rochester, New York, and grew up in Port Clinton, Ohio, where he participated in a competitive bowling league as a teenager. Putnam graduated from Swarthmore College in 1963 where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. He won a Fulbright Fellowship to study at Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree and doctorate from Yale University in 1970. He taught at the University of Michigan until joining the faculty at Harvard in 1979, where he has held a variety of positions, including Dean of the Kennedy School, and is currently the Malkin Professor of Public Policy. Putnam was raised as a religiously observant Methodist. In 1963, Putnam married his wife Rosemary, a special education teacher and French horn player. Around the time of his marriage, he converted to Judaism, his wife&#x27;s religion.

==&quot;Making Democracy Work&quot;==
His first work in the area of social capital was &quot;Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy&quot;. published in 1993. It is a comparative study of regional governments in Italy that drew great scholarly attention for its argument that the success of democracies depends in large part on the horizontal bonds that make up social capital. Putnam writes that northern Italy&#x27;s history of community, guilds, clubs, and choral societies led to greater civic involvement and greater economic prosperity. Meanwhile, the agrarian society of Southern Italy is less prosperous economically and democratically because of less social capital. Social capital, which Putnam defines as &quot;networks and norms of civic engagement&quot;, allows members of a community to trust one another. When community members trust one another, trade, money-lending, and democracy flourish.

Putnam&#x27;s finding that social capital has pro-democracy effects has been rebutted by a sizable literature which finds that civic associations have been associated with the rise of anti-democratic movements.

==&quot;Bowling Alone&quot;==
In 1995, he published &quot;Bowling Alone: America&#x27;s Declining Social Capital&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot;. The article was widely read and garnered much attention for Putnam, including an invitation to meet with then-President Bill Clinton and a spot in the pages of &quot;People&quot;.

In 2000, he published &quot;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community&quot;, a book-length expansion of the original argument, adding new evidence and answering many of his critics. Though he measured the decline of social capital with data of many varieties, his most striking point was that many traditional civic, social and fraternal organizations – typified by bowling leagues – had undergone a massive decline in membership while the number of people bowling had increased dramatically.

Putnam distinguishes two kinds of social capital: bonding capital and bridging capital. Bonding occurs among similar people (same age, same race, same religion, etc.), while bridging involves the same activities among dissimilar people. He argues that peaceful multi-ethnic societies require both types. Putnam argues that those two kinds of social capital, bonding and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the bonding capital mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.

In 2016, Putnam explained his inspiration for the book, by saying,
Critics such as the sociologist Claude Fischer argue that Putnam (a) concentrates on certain forms of social organizations, and pays much less attention to privatized networks or emerging forms of support organizations on and off the Internet; (b) relies on contradictory data that hasn&#x27;t fully been explained; and (c) underestimates the impact of women&#x27;s workforce participation. Fischer calls for reconceptualizing social capital and proposing other explanations of the decline in public civic participation. 

Since the publication of &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, Putnam has worked on efforts to revive American social capital, notably through the Saguaro Seminar, a series of meetings among academics, civil society leaders, commentators, and politicians to discuss strategies to re-connect Americans with their communities. These resulted in the publication of the book and website, &quot;Better Together,&quot; in 2003 which provides case studies of vibrant and new forms of social capital building in the United States.

== Social capital ==
Putnam theorizes a relation in the negatives trends in society. He envisions a uniting factor named social capital; originally coined (no evidence provided) by social theorist Alexis de Tocqueville as a strength within America allowing democracy to thrive due to the closeness of society, &quot;trends in civic engagement of a wider sort&quot;. Putnam observes a declining trend in social capital since the 1960s. The decreasing in social capital is blamed for rising rates in unhappiness as well as political apathy. Low social capital, a feeling of alienation within society is associated with additional consequences such as:
* Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media.
* Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one&#x27;s own influence.
* Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.
* Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result.
* Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage).
* Less likelihood of working on a community project.
* Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering.
* Fewer close friends and confidants.
* Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.
* More time spent watching television and more agreement that &quot;television is my most important form of entertainment&quot;.

==Diversity and trust within communities==

In recent years, Putnam has been engaged in a comprehensive study of the relationship between trust within communities and their ethnic diversity. His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that in the short term, other things being equal, &quot;more&quot; diversity in a community is associated with &quot;less&quot; trust both among and within ethnic groups. Putnam describes people of all races, sex, socioeconomic statuses, and ages as &quot;hunkering down&quot;, avoiding engagement with their local community as diversity increases. Putnam found that even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates, two factors which conflict theory states should be prime causal factors in declining inter-ethnic group trust, more diversity is still associated with less communal trust. Further, he found that low communal trust is associated with the same consequences as low social capital. Putnam says, however, that &quot;in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits.&quot;

Putnam published his data set from this study in 2001 and subsequently published the full paper in 2007.

Putnam has been criticized for the lag between his initial study and his publication of his article. In 2006, Putnam was quoted in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as saying he had delayed publishing the article until he could &quot;develop proposals to compensate for the negative effects of diversity&quot; (quote from John Lloyd of Financial Times). In 2007, writing in &quot;City Journal&quot;, John Leo questioned whether this suppression of publication was ethical behavior for a scholar, noting that &quot;Academics aren&#x27;t supposed to withhold negative data until they can suggest antidotes to their findings.&quot; On the other hand, Putnam did release the data in 2001 and publicized this fact.

Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been &quot;twisted&quot; to make a case against race-based admissions to universities. He asserted that his &quot;extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.&quot;

<text>University of Canterbury Mount John Observatory (UCMJO), previously known as Mt John University Observatory (MJUO), is New Zealand&#x27;s premier astronomical research observatory. It is situated at ASL atop Mount John at the northern end of the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island, and was established in 1965. There are many telescopes on site including: one 0.4 metre, two 0.6 metre, one 1.0 metre, and a 1.8 metre MOA telescope. The nearest population centre is the resort town of Lake Tekapo (pop. &gt;500). Approximately 20% of nights at UCMJO are photometric, with a larger number available for spectroscopic work and direct imaging photometry.

UCMJO is operated by the University of Canterbury, and is the home of HERCULES (High Efficiency and Resolution Canterbury University Large Echelle Spectrograph), and the observational wing of the Japanese/New Zealand MOA collaboration (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) led by Yasushi Muraki of Nagoya University. A Japanese funded, 1.8 metre telescope was used initially by the MOA Project, before handover to the University of Canterbury at the conclusion of the MOA Project in 2012.

In June 2012 an area of around the observatory was declared as the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association, one of only four such reserves around the world at that time. The area has a Bortle Scale of 2.

== Facilities ==

There are 5 large telescopes on the mountain that are in regular use. There is also a cafe and night-tours run by tourist operators, Dark Sky Project. There is accommodation for visiting researchers within the 1.0 m telescope building. A superintendent lives on the mountain.

=== MOA telescope ===

Opened in December 2004, this telescope was built by Japanese astronomers and is dedicated to the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) project. It is a 1.8 m prime focus reflector. The MOA telescope is the largest optical telescope in New Zealand.

=== McLellan telescope ===

This is a 1.0 m Dall-Kirkham reflecting telescope run at either f/7.7 or f/13.5. It was installed in February 1986. Photometric imaging is by CCD camera and spectroscopy is by fibre-optic cable to the HERCULES spectrograph.

The McLellan telescope is named after Alister McLellan who was the Head of the Department of Physics at University of Canterbury from 1955 to 1985. He was instrumental in the development of the Mt John Observatory and when it opened in 1965 he was appointed its first director.

=== Boller &amp; Chivens telescope ===

This is a 0.61 m reflecting telescope run at either f/13.5 or occasionally f/6.25. Photometry is usually carried out using an FLI CCD camera.

=== Optical Craftsmen telescope ===

This is a 0.61 m fork mounted reflecting telescope operating at f/16. This telescope is used exclusively for CCD photometry. It has been upgraded and commissioned for robotic use as part of the AAVSO&#x27;s Robotic Telescope Network. This is the AAVSO&#x27;s first Southern Hemisphere telescope.

=== Dark Sky Project telescope ===

This telescope, used exclusively for visual tourist operations is a 0.4 m Meade LX200 telescope.

== Discoveries ==

In June 2008 it was reported at the meeting of American Astronomical Society that using their new MOA-II telescope, the observatory discovered what was at the time the smallest planet known outside of our Solar System. The planet MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb is just 3.3 times larger than Earth and is orbiting a small star, MOA-2007-BLG-192L (3000 light years from Earth). There is some possibility the planet has a thick atmosphere and a liquid ocean on its surface.

<text>Wilbert Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel (March 11, 1890May 11, 1969) was an American Democratic Party politician from Texas, who came to prominence by hosting a popular radio program. Known for his populist appeal and support of Texas&#x27;s business community, O&#x27;Daniel served as the 34th governor of Texas (1939–1941) and later its junior United States senator (1941–1949). O&#x27;Daniel chose not to run for reelection to the Senate in 1948 and was succeeded by future U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson.

O&#x27;Daniel was also a songwriter who composed &quot;Beautiful Texas&quot;.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Daniel was born in Malta, Ohio. His father was killed in an accident while O&#x27;Daniel was a boy, and his mother remarried. The family moved to a cattle ranch near Arlington, Kansas. O&#x27;Daniel attended local schools and graduated from the two-year program at Salt City Business College in Hutchinson, Kansas. In 1909 he relocated to Anthony, Kansas to become a stenographer and bookkeeper for a flour milling company. After time with companies in Kansas City, Missouri and New Orleans, in 1925 he began to work for the Burrus Mill flour company in Fort Worth.

==Radio fame==
In the late 1920s, O&#x27;Daniel assumed responsibility for the Burrus company&#x27;s radio advertising. To that end, he wrote songs, sang, and hired a group of musicians to form an old timey band to back his vocals. Originally called the Light Crust Doughboys, notable musicians such as Bob Wills got their start with O&#x27;Daniel. After the Doughboys split up, O&#x27;Daniel formed the Western swing band Pat O&#x27;Daniel and his Hillbilly Boys. The new group was named after O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s own Hillbilly Flour Company. O&#x27;Daniel also hosted a regular noontime radio show heard statewide, which gave him his nickname after a catchphrase used frequently on air – &quot;pass the biscuits, Pappy&quot; – and propelled him into the public spotlight. By the mid-1930s, &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel was a household name in Texas. As a national magazine reporter wrote at the time: &quot;At twelve-thirty sharp each day, a fifteen-minute silence reigned in the state of Texas, broken only by mountain music, and the dulcet voice of W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel.&quot; The show extolled the values of Hillbilly brand flour, the Ten Commandments and the Bible.

==Political career==

===Governor===
In 1938, he ran for governor of Texas as a Democrat. O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s campaign hailed his flour and the need for pensions and tax cuts. He promised to block a sales tax and raise pensions. O&#x27;Daniel won the Democratic primary election with 51 percent of the ballots over twelve opponents. In office, he seemingly went against his campaign promise by proposing a new transaction tax, which was voted down by the Texas Legislature. Despite this position change, he remained personally popular and handily won re-election in 1940. In both elections, his main competition came from Texas Railroad Commissioner Ernest O. Thompson, the former mayor of Amarillo.

===U.S. Senate===
In 1941, O&#x27;Daniel ran for the United States Senate in a special election. He defeated Lyndon Johnson by 1,311 votes in one of the most controversial elections in state history. As a result of this experience, in the 1948 election, Johnson prepared for a close runoff by arranging for his supporters who controlled votes, including George Parr, to withhold their final tallies until the statewide results were announced. As a senator, O&#x27;Daniel was ineffective, and most of his legislation was defeated. He endorsed the anti-Roosevelt Texas Regulars in the 1944 presidential election. Elected to a full term in 1942, O&#x27;Daniel refused to run for another term in 1948.

==Later career==
After leaving the Senate, O&#x27;Daniel bought a ranch near Fort Worth. He invested in real estate in Dallas and was also active in the insurance business.

O&#x27;Daniel ran for governor in 1956 and 1958 and claimed that the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision was part of a Communist conspiracy. He finished third in the Democratic primaries both times.

==Death and burial==
O&#x27;Daniel died in Dallas on May 11, 1969. He was buried at Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas.

==In popular culture==
The 2000 Coen Brothers film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; featured a character played by Charles Durning and named Governor Pappy O&#x27;Daniel, loosely based on the real O&#x27;Daniel, though set in Mississippi.

<doc id="615402" wikidata="Q1517381" url="?curid=615402" title="Ball valve">
<text>A ball valve is a flow control device which uses a hollow, perforated, and pivoting ball to control fluid flowing through it. It is open when the hole through the middle of the ball is in line with the flow inlet and closed when it is pivoted 90 degrees by the valve handle, blocking the flow. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open, and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual confirmation of the valve&#x27;s status. The shut position 1/4 turn could be in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.

Ball valves are durable, performing well after many cycles, and reliable, closing securely even after long periods of disuse. These qualities make them an excellent choice for shutoff and control applications, where they are often preferred to gates and globe valves, but they lack the fine control of those alternatives, in throttling applications.

The ball valve&#x27;s ease of operation, repair, and versatility lend it to extensive industrial use, supporting pressures up to and temperatures up to , depending on design and materials used. Sizes typically range from 0.2 to 48 in (5 to 1200 mm). Valve bodies are made of metal, plastic, or metal with a ceramic; floating balls are often chrome plated for durability. One disadvantage of a ball valve is that when used for controlling water flow, they trap water in the center cavity while in the closed position. In the event of ambient temperatures falling below freezing point, the sides can crack due to the expansion associated with ice formation. Some means of insulation or heat tape in this situation will usually prevent damage. Another option for cold climates is the &quot;freeze tolerant ball valve&quot;. This style of ball valve incorporates a freeze plug in the side so in the event of a freeze-up, the freeze plug ruptures, acting as a &#x27;sacrificial&#x27; fail point, allowing an easier repair. Instead of replacing the whole valve, all that is required is the fitting of a new freeze plug.

For cryogenic fluids, or product that may expand inside of the ball, there is a vent drilled into the upstream side of the valve. This is referred to as a vented ball.

A ball valve should not be confused with a &quot;ball-check valve&quot;, a type of check valve that uses a solid ball to prevent undesired backflow.

Other types of quarter-turn valves include the butterfly valve and plug valve and freeze proof ball valve.
==Types==
There are five general body styles of ball valves: &quot;single body&quot;, &quot;three-piece body&quot;, &quot;split body&quot;, &quot;top entry&quot;, and &quot;welded&quot;. The difference is based on how the pieces of the valve—especially the casing that contains the ball itself—are manufactured and assembled. The valve operation is the same in each case.

The one-piece bodies provide a very rigid construction, in some versions the ball is removable from the valve without taking the entire valve out of the line however multi-piece bodies offer greater scope for ingenuity of design.

In addition, there are different styles related to the bore of the ball mechanism itself. And depending on the working pressure, the ball valves are categorized as low-pressure ball valves and high-pressure ball valves. In most industries, the ball valves with working pressures higher than are considered high-pressure ball valves. Usually the maximum working pressure for the high-pressure ball valves is and depends on the structure, sizes and sealing materials. The maximum working pressure of high-pressure ball valves can be up to . High-pressure ball valves are often used in hydraulic systems, so they are also known as hydraulic ball valves.

Ball valves in sizes up to generally come in a single piece, two or three-piece designs. One-piece ball valves are almost always reduced bore, are relatively inexpensive, and are generally replaced instead of repaired. Two-piece ball valves generally have a slightly reduced (or standard) bore, and can be either throw-away or repairable. The three-piece design allows for the center part of the valve containing the ball, stem and seats to be easily removed from the pipeline. This facilitates efficient cleaning of deposited sediments, replacement of seats and gland packings, polishing out of small scratches on the ball, all this without removing the pipes from the valve body. The design concept of a three-piece valve is for it to be repairable. Each valve is heated to a certain degree, while the excess material is trimmed from the body.

===Full bore===
A full bore (sometimes full port) ball valve has an oversized ball so that the hole in the ball is the same size as the pipeline resulting in lower friction loss. Flow is unrestricted but the valve is larger and more expensive so this is only used where free flow is required, for example in pipelines that require pigging.

===Reduced bore, or reduced port===
In reduced bore (sometimes reduced port) ball valves, flow through the valve is one pipe size smaller than the valve&#x27;s pipe size resulting in the flow area being smaller than the pipe. As the flow discharge remains constant and is equal to the area of flow (A) times velocity (V), formula_1 the velocity increases with reduced area of flow.

===V port===
A V port ball valve has either a &#x27;v&#x27; shaped ball or a &#x27;v&#x27; shaped seat. This allows for linear and even equal percentage flow characteristics. When the valve is in the closed position and opening is commenced the small end of the &#x27;v&#x27; is opened first allowing stable flow control during this stage. This type of design requires a generally more robust construction due to higher velocities of the fluids, which might damage a standard valve. When machined correctly these are excellent control valves, offering superior leakage performance. 

===Cavity filler===
Many industries encounter problems with residues in the ball valve. Where the fluid is meant for human consumption, residues may also be a health hazard, and where the fluid changes from time to time contamination of one fluid with another may occur. Residues arise because in the half-open position of the ball valve a gap is created between the ball bore and the body in which fluid can be trapped. To avoid the fluid getting into this cavity, the cavity has to be plugged, which can be done by extending the seats in such a manner that it is always in contact with the ball. This type of ball valve is known as Cavity Filler Ball Valve.

There are a few types of ball valves related to the attachment and lateral movement of the ball:

===Trunnion, floating and actuated===
A trunnion ball valve has additional mechanical anchoring of the ball at the top and the bottom, suitable for larger and higher pressure valves (generally above and ).

A floating ball valve is one where the ball is not held in place by a trunnion. In normal operation, this will cause the ball to float downstream slightly. This causes the seating mechanism to compress under the ball pressing against it. Furthermore, in some types, in the event of some force causing the seat mechanism to dissipate (such as extreme heat from fire outside the valve), the ball will float all the way to metal body which is designed to seal against the ball providing a somewhat failsafe design.

Manually operated ball valves can be closed quickly and thus there is a danger of water hammer. Some ball valves are equipped with an actuator that may be pneumatically, hydraulically or motor operated. These valves can be used either for on/off or flow control. A pneumatic flow control valve is also equipped with a positioner which transforms the control signal into actuator position and valve opening accordingly.

===Multiport===

* Three- and four-way have an L- or T-shaped hole through the middle. The different combinations of flow are shown in the figure. It is easy to see that a T valve can connect any pair of ports, or all three, together, but the 45 degree position which might disconnect all three leaves no margin for error. The L valve can connect the center port to either side port, or disconnect all three, but it cannot connect the side ports together.
*Multi-port ball valves with 4 ways, or more, are also commercially available, the inlet way often being orthogonal to the plane of the outlets. For special applications, such as driving air-powered motors from forward to reverse, the operation is performed by rotating a single lever four-way valve. The 4-way ball valve has two L-shaped ports in the ball that do not interconnect, sometimes referred to as an &quot;×&quot; port.
== Materials of construction ==
Body materials may include, but are not limited to, any of these materials:
* Stainless steel
* Brass
* Bronze
* Chrome
* Titanium
* PVC
* CPVC
* PFA-lined

There are many different types of seats and seals that are used in ball valves as well. Valves are usually manufactured with different materials, each with specific applications they are good for due to their chemical compatibility, pressures, and temperatures. Some of the commonly used materials include brass, stainless steel, bronze etc. These material choices ensure that valves are suitable for their respective functions, providing efficient and reliable performance in various industries and applications.

<doc id="615407" wikidata="Q797197" url="?curid=615407" title="BWIA West Indies Airways">
<text>BWIA West Indies Airways Limited, known locally as &quot;Bee-Wee&quot; and previously as British West Indian Airways and BWIA International Airways, was the flag carrier of Trinidad and Tobago. At the end of operations, BWIA was the largest airline operating out of the Caribbean, with direct service to the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Its main hub was Piarco International Airport (POS), Piarco, with major hubs at Grantley Adams International Airport (BGI) in Barbados and Cheddi Jagan International Airport (GEO) in Guyana during 2006. It was headquartered in the BWIA Administration Building in Piarco, Tunapuna–Piarco on the island of Trinidad. The company slogan was &quot;Sharing our warmth with the world.&quot;

The company announced on 8 September 2006 that the airline would be shut down on 31 December 2006. All of the approximately 1700 employees were separated from the company but applied for new contracts with a new entity, [[Caribbean Airlines]].

== History ==

===Early history===
British West Indian Airways was established on 27 November 1939 by New Zealander Lowell Yerex. Operations started on 27 November 1940 with a piston powered Lockheed Lodestar twin engine aircraft on daily services between Trinidad and Barbados. By 1942, the airline had three aircraft of this type. In 1947, BWIA was taken over by British South American Airways (BSAA), after a few months operating as British International Air Lines the &#x27;BWIA&#x27; name was restored on 24 June 1948 for operating routes among the Caribbean Islands using Vickers Viking twin piston-engined airliners.
In 1949, BSAA merged with British Overseas Airways Corporation and BWIA became a subsidiary of BOAC. Vickers Viscount four engine turboprops were introduced in 1955 with Bristol Britannias leased in 1960 to fly the long-haul route to London, via New York City. In 1960 BWIA had its head office in Port of Spain, Trinidad. On 1 November 1961, the government of Trinidad and Tobago acquired 90% of the shares in the airline and achieved complete ownership by 1967.

For BWIA the jet age began in 1964 with the introduction of new Boeing 727-100 jetliners billed as the Sunjet, which replaced the Viscount turboprops on the New York route. According to its timetable, in 1968 the airline was operating nonstop Boeing 727 flights from New York to Antigua with continuing no change of plane 727 service to Barbados, St. Lucia and Port of Spain as well as nonstop 727 flights from Miami to Grand Cayman and Montego Bay with continuing no change of plane 727 service to Kingston, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Antigua, St. Lucia, Barbados and Port of Spain, and was also serving Caracas, Guyana, Suriname and Tobago with the 727. In early 1971 four second-hand Boeing 707 series 200 airliners were purchased from Braniff International Airways and operated on US and intra-Caribbean services until their disposal in late 1975.

===Later history===
The London route was restarted in 1975 using Boeing 707 jets. In 1976 Peter Look Hong replaced Sven-Erik Svanberg as CEO of BWIA. BWIA became BWIA International Airways in 1980 after a merger with Trinidad and Tobago Air Services (which had been formed by the government in June 1974), becoming the national airline. BWIA aircraft livery had the &#x27;Trinidad and Tobago Airways&#x27; adjacent to the &#x27;BWIA International&#x27; after the merger. The same year also saw the Boeing 707s replaced on the London service with long-range Lockheed L-1011-500 TriStar wide-body jetliners. In 1986, BWIA bought its first McDonnell Douglas MD-83. The airline also operated stretched McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 jetliners as well as a Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet at one point.


By 1994, the airline had become partially privatised. A substantial reorganisation of its route network left London and Frankfurt the only European destinations. The airline ordered Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft, then canceled the order in favor of Airbus A321 and Airbus A340 jets; in turn, this order was dropped after only two A321s were delivered. On 22 February 1995, the government of Trinidad and Tobago completed the privatisation of BWIA by turning over majority control of the common stock and management of the airline to a private group of US and Caribbean investors.

In the early 2000s (decade), BWIA changed its livery to a new Caribbean green and blue color scheme with its famous steelpan trademark, the national musical instrument of its home base. The fleet had been upgraded to seven Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft, two Airbus A340-300s, and two Bombardier de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Q300 Dash 8 twin turboprop regional aircraft flown by BWIA&#x27;s sister airline Tobago Express, which provided service on the short hop between Port of Spain and Trinidad&#x27;s sister island Tobago as well as other destinations in the region.

By 2003, BWIA had become one of the leading Caribbean airlines, carrying over 1.4 million passengers a year with over 600 departures in the Caribbean and another 60 international departures every week. BWIA earned roughly US$276 million per year, employed 2,350 staff, had 70 daily flights, and carried 8,100 tonnes (17,900,000 pounds) of air cargo per year. Its inflight magazine, &quot;Caribbean Beat&quot;, was well regarded. However, BWIA had also been plagued by losses and had a history of continuous injections of funds from the government of Trinidad and Tobago. The airline had filed for an IPO, although no date was set.
The airline was owned by the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (75%) and private shareholders (25%) and had 2,588 employees (in January 2005). It also had holdings in other airlines: Tobago Express (45%) and LIAT (23.6%).

On September 8, 2006, BWIA West Indies Airways announced its demise, after failed negotiations with the ACAWU, CATTU, Superintendent&#x27;s Association and BWIA&#x27;s management. CEO Peter Davies, who joined BWIA in March 2006, said that a new airline, Caribbean Airlines, based in Trinidad and Tobago, would replace BWIA after 66 years of flying the Caribbean skies. Caribbean Airlines remains in current operation.

BWIA&#x27;s Pilots were represented by the Trinidad and Tobago Airline Pilots Association (TTALPA), which is affiliated to IFALPA. TTALPA is also part of the regional Caribbean Airline Pilots Association (C-ALPA). The other recognised Unions at BWIA were: Airline Superintendents Association; the Aviation, Communication and Allied Workers Union, which represented ground staff and flight attendants, and the Communication, Transport and General Workers Union which organised middle management and engineers.

<text>The Atlanta&quot;-class cruiserswere eight [[United States Navy]] [[light cruiser]]s which were designed as fast [[scout cruisers]], [[flotilla leaders]], or [[destroyer leader|destroyer leaders]], but which proved to be effective [[anti-aircraft]] cruisers during [[World War II]]. They were also known as the Atlanta&quot;-&quot;Oakland&quot; class. The &quot;Atlanta&quot; class originally had 16 x /38 caliber guns in eight two-gun turrets, arranged with three superfiring turrets forward, three more superfiring aft and two waist mounts, one port and one starboard, giving the first four &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers the heaviest anti-aircraft armament of any cruiser of World War II. The last four ships of the class, starting with , had a slightly revised armament with a reduced main gun battery - the waist turrets being deleted - as they were further optimized for anti-aircraft fire in light of war experience.

The &quot;Atlanta&quot; class saw heavy action during World War II, collectively earning 54 battle stars. Two ships of the class were sunk in action: and , both at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The other six were decommissioned shortly after the war and were scrapped in the 1960s.

==Specifications==
As built, the original main gun battery of the first quartet of the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class was composed of eight dual /38 caliber gun mounts (8 × 2 5-inch guns). This battery could fire over of shells per minute, including the radar-fuzed &quot;VT&quot; anti-aircraft (AA) shells. Fire control was by two Mk 37 fire control systems located on the centerline atop the superstructure. As built, these ships lacked radar but from the spring of 1942 they were re-fitted with FD (Mk 4) fire control radar and SC-1 and SG search radar. From 1943 the FD (Mk 4) radar was replaced by the improved Mk 12/Mk 22 combination.

The first four &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers originally had a secondary anti-aircraft armament of twelve /75 caliber guns in three quad mountings, without directors fitted. By early 1942, as more weapons became available, a fourth quad mount had been installed on the quarterdeck and directors were fitted (probably Mk 44). By late 1942 these troublesome and relatively ineffective weapons began to be replaced in the surviving ships by twin mountings for the new and far superior Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns with Mk 51 directors.

Also from early 1942, close-range AA armament was augmented by eight 20 mm rapid-fire anti-aircraft cannons in single Mk 4 mountings disposed two on the forward superstructure, four amidships between the funnels (displacing some of the ship&#x27;s boats) and two on the quarterdeck aft. From 1943 onward, two more Mk 4 mountings were added on the forward superstructure and a pair on each side of the second funnel to counter the danger of Japanese air attacks. From the end of 1943, a quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounting replaced the twin mount on the quarterdeck, with the six depth charge projectors being removed as compensation. The additions of radar, additional close-range anti-aircraft guns and other equipment seriously impaired the stability of these ships as the war progressed and resulted in overcrowding as more ratings had to be added to man them.

The second quartet of the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class, sometimes known as the &quot;Oakland&quot; class, was commissioned with only six twin 5-inch/38 mounts and with Bofors guns from the start, with four additional twin Bofors 40 mm mounts compared to their predecessors: two displacing the former 5-inch/38 wing turrets (improving both stability and close-range AA firepower while easing congestion) and two between the funnels displacing the previous two pairs of 20 mm Oerlikons. In addition the battery of 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons was increased with a pair on the bow, four on the forward superstructure, eight amidships arrayed on either side of the aft funnel and two on the quarterdeck aft for a total of sixteen.

The &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers were the only class of U.S. Navy cruisers commissioned during World War II to be armed with torpedo tubes, with eight torpedo tubes in two quad launchers.

By the end of the war had been given an anti-&quot;kamikaze&quot; upgrade which included replacing the four aft twin Bofors with quad mountings and greatly reducing the number of 20 mm mounts (to possibly as few as six) while replacing those that remained with twin rather than single guns. The torpedo tubes were removed.

Although ships of this class were planned as destroyer flotilla leaders, the original design did not include anti-submarine armament such as sonar or a depth charge battery. In early 1942, along with anti-aircraft and radar upgrades, these ships were fitted with sonar and the standard destroyer battery of six depth charge projectors and two stern mounted tracks. When the vessels were determined to be more valuable as protection against aircraft, the projectors were removed but the tracks were retained. The &quot;Oakland&quot; sub-class never received the projectors, getting only two stern tracks, probably due to marginal stability.

The class was powered by four 665 psi boilers, connected to two geared steam turbines producing , and the ships could maintain a top speed of . On trial the &quot;Atlanta&quot; made and . The ships of the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class had thin armor: a maximum of on their sides covering machinery and magazines, with the 5-inch gun mounts being protected by only and the conning tower by .

The ships were originally designed for 26 officers and 523 men, but this increased to 35 officers and 638 men with the first four ships, and 45 officers and 766 men with the second group of four ships beginning with &quot;Oakland&quot;. The ships were also designed as flagships with additional space for a flag officer and his staff but the additional space was used for additional crew necessary to man anti-aircraft weapons and electronics.

==Criticisms==
Although very formidable as anti-aircraft ships, the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers did not fare well in combat. Of the three light cruisers lost by the U.S. Navy during World War II, two were &quot;Atlanta&quot;s. The only two cruisers of the class that engaged in surface combat were sunk: &quot;Atlanta&quot; and &quot;Juneau&quot;. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was sunk in surface combat during the Guadalcanal Campaign while &quot;Juneau&quot; was heavily damaged in the same battle and sunk by on her way back for repairs. Both of these vessels received their fatal blows from Japanese torpedoes, and gunfire from larger, more heavily armed ships. The unique armament of the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class did not contribute to their loss.

The &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class design was also criticized for its shortage of gunfire directors for the main 5-inch gun battery, which reduced its effectiveness. Initially there were not enough intermediate anti-aircraft guns (i.e. 1.1 in guns or Bofors 40 mm). These problems were somewhat corrected in naval shipyards by the end of 1942, but the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class warships were thereafter overloaded with weight, compared to the size of their hulls. Throughout World War II and the postwar years, they had problems with topside weight; this was addressed by a redesign of the class which was then constructed as the three s.

==Service history==
All eight ships in this class served during World War II, and six ships survived the war. The lead ship of this class, , was laid down on 22 April 1940 and launched on 6 September 1941. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 December 1941, just a few weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of 7 December. &quot;Atlanta&quot; participated as an anti-aircraft cruiser in the decisive American victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 before she was sent south to fight in the Solomon Islands. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was scuttled after receiving a torpedo hit and heavy gunfire damage from Japanese surface warships and on 13 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. was also heavily damaged in surface combat in the same battle and then sunk by the , on 13 November 1942. was torpedoed off Leyte on 4 November 1944 resulting in a large fire and significant flooding, but was saved from sinking by the damage control efforts of the crew.

After the war, the six surviving ships in this class were decommissioned between 1947 and 1949 and placed in the reserve fleet. The ships received a new type designation of CLAA in 1949. None of these ships were recommissioned to serve in an active role; all were ultimately struck and scrapped by 1970.

<text>Kids is a 1995 American drama film directed by Larry Clark in his directorial debut and written by Harmony Korine in his screenwriting debut. It stars Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce and Chloë Sevigny in their film debuts. Fitzpatrick, Pierce, Sevigny, and other newcomers including Rosario Dawson portray a group of teenagers in New York City. They are characterized as hedonists, who engage in sexual acts and substance abuse, over the course of a single day.

Ben Detrick of the &quot;New York Times&quot; has described the film as &quot;&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; with skateboards, nitrous oxide and hip-hop... There is no thunderous moral reckoning, only observational detachment.&quot; The film caused controversy upon its release in 1995 over its treatment of the subject matter. It received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, but was released without a rating. Critical response was mixed, and the film grossed $20.4 million on a $1.5 million budget. It is now considered a cult classic.

== Plot ==
Telly and a 12-year-old girl are making out on a bed. With no adults around, Telly, who is a few years older, pressures the girl, a virgin, to have sex with him. Afterwards, he meets his best friend, Casper, and they talk about his sexual experience. Telly has taken to only having sex with virgins. They then enter a local store, where Casper shoplifts a bottle of malt liquor and on the way out Casper steals 2 peaches from a Korean fruit vendor. Looking for drugs, food, and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul&#x27;s apartment despite disliking him. As Telly and Casper sit down, they watch skaters on the TV and Casper does a whippet. As time goes on they join the other boys in boasting about their sexual prowess and nonchalant attitudes to unprotected sex and venereal diseases.

Across the city, a group of girls are talking about sex. Their attitudes contradict that of the boys on many topics, particularly fellatio and the significance of the individuals to whom they lost their virginity. Two of the girls, Ruby and Jennie, mention that they were recently tested for STDs: Ruby tests negative, even though she has had multiple sexual encounters; Jennie tests positive for HIV. She tells the nurse that she has had sex only once, with Telly. Distraught, she tries to find him to prevent him from passing HIV on to another girl. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper walk to Telly&#x27;s house and steal money from his mother.

After purchasing marijuana, they gather with a few friends and, together, taunt a gay couple passing by. As Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man who angrily threatens and pushes him. The man is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Casper&#x27;s friend Harold, causing him to collapse. Several other skaters join in, beating the man until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper.

Telly and some of the skaters then pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy—the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance—with whom Telly wants to have sex, but Darcy shows restraint. Afterward, the group goes to an unsupervised party at the house of their friend Steven.

Jennie meets Misha, a girl who dislikes Casper and notes Telly&#x27;s possible whereabouts at The Shelter. When Jennie arrives at the club, she runs into a boy named Fidget, who shoves a pill into her mouth; she learns Telly is at Steven&#x27;s house. On the way, she drifts in and out of consciousness due to the effects of the pill. Unfortunately when Jennie arrives, Darcy and Telly have already begun having sex, exposing Darcy to HIV. Jennie cries and passes out among the other partygoers due to the pill, which was actually a roofie.

The morning after, a drunk Casper rapes Jennie as she sleeps, unwittingly exposing himself to HIV. After a montage shows homeless people and drug users in the waking New York City, a voiceover by Telly says that sex is the only worthwhile thing in his life. A naked Casper says, &quot;Jesus Christ, what happened?&quot;

== Cast ==

* Leo Fitzpatrick as Telly
* Justin Pierce as Casper
* Chloë Sevigny as Jennie
* Rosario Dawson as Ruby
* Yakira Peguero as Darcy
* Atabey Rodriguez as Misha
* Jon Abrahams as Steven
* Harold Hunter as Harold
* Sajan Bhagat as Paul
* Hamilton Harris as Hamilton
Sarah Henderson portrays the first girl Telly is seen having sex with. Tony Morales and Walter Youngblood portray the gay couple. Julie Stebe-Glorius and Christiana Stebe-Glorius appear as Telly&#x27;s mother and younger brother, respectively. The Rastafari is played by an actor credited as &quot;Dr. Henry&quot;. Screenwriter Harmony Korine has an uncredited appearance as Fidget.

== Production ==
Larry Clark said that he wanted to &quot;make the Great American Teenage Movie, like the Great American Novel.&quot; The film is shot in a quasi-documentary style, although all of its scenes are scripted.

In &quot;Kids&quot;, Clark cast New York City &quot;street&quot; kids with no previous acting experience, notably Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly) and Justin Pierce (Casper). Clark originally decided he wanted to cast Fitzpatrick in a film after watching him skateboard in New York, and cursing when he could not land certain tricks. Korine had met Chloë Sevigny in New York before production began on &quot;Kids&quot;, and initially cast her in a small role as one of the girls in the swimming pool. She was given the leading role of Jennie after Mia Kirshner, the original actress cast, was deemed not the right fit to work with first-time actors. Sevigny and Korine went on to make &quot;Gummo&quot; (1997) and &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; (1999) together. Korine makes a cameo in the club scene with Jennie, as the kid wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a Nuclear Assault shirt who gives her drugs, though the part is credited to his brother Avi.

Korine reportedly wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay in 1993, at the age of 18, and principal photography took place during the summer of 1994. Contrary to the perception of many viewers, the film, according to Korine, was almost entirely scripted, with the only exception being the scene with Casper on the couch at the end, which was improvised. Gus Van Sant had been attached to the film as a producer. After insufficient interest had been generated in the film, he left the project. Under incoming producer Cary Woods, the project found sufficient independent funding for the film. Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, wary of parent The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s opinion of the risky screenplay, declined to involve Disney in funding the production of the film. After Woods showed him the final cut, Miramax paid $3.5 million to buy the worldwide distribution rights of this film.

==Release==
Miramax Films, which was owned by The Walt Disney Company, paid $3.5 million to buy the worldwide distribution rights. Later, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the co-chairmen of Miramax Films, were forced to buy back the film from Disney and created Shining Excalibur Films, a one-off company, to release the film, due to Disney&#x27;s policy, that at the time, forbid the release of NC-17 rated films, and the fact their appeal to the MPAA to lower it to R was denied. Eamonn Bowles was hired to be the chief operating officer of Shining Excalibur Films.

The film, which cost $1.5 million to produce, grossed $7.4 million in the North American box office and $20 million worldwide. According to Peter Biskind&#x27;s book &quot;Down and Dirty Pictures&quot;, Eamonn Bowles had stated that Harvey and Bob Weinstein might have personally profited up to $2 million each.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 47% based on 58 critic&#x27;s reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Kids&quot; isn&#x27;t afraid to test viewers&#x27; limits, but the point of its nearly non-stop provocation is likely to be lost in all the repellent characters and unpleasant imagery&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63/100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film was championed by some prominent critics, including Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars. &quot;&quot;Kids&quot; is the kind of movie that needs to be talked about afterward. It doesn&#x27;t tell us what it means. Sure, it has a &#x27;message&#x27;, involving safe sex. But safe sex is not going to civilize these kids, make them into curious, capable citizens. What you realize, thinking about Telly, is that life has given him nothing that interests him, except for sex, drugs and skateboards. His life is a kind of hell, briefly interrupted by orgasms.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;wake-up call to the modern world&quot; about the nature of present-day youth in urban life. She added it is also &quot;an extremely difficult film to sit through, with an emphasis on societal disintegration and adolescent selfishness at its most sordid&quot;, and that some viewers will find issue with Clark&#x27;s lack of judgment on the events depicted. Some critics labeled it exploitative, describing it as borderline &quot;child pornography&quot;.

Other critics derided the film, with the most common criticism relating to the perceived lack of artistic merit. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Thomson said, &quot;Ostensibly about the banality of youthful evil, &#x27;Kids&#x27; is simply about its own banality. At best, it&#x27;s a misplaced aesthetic experiment. At worst, it&#x27;s glossy exploitation—with enough controversy to launch a thousand trite radio and television talk shows.&quot;

Feminist scholar bell hooks spoke extensively about the film in &quot;Cultural Criticism and Transformation&quot;: &quot;&quot;Kids&quot; fascinated me as a film precisely because when you heard about it, it seemed like the perfect embodiment of the kind of postmodern, notions of journeying and dislocation and fragmentation and yet when you go to see it, it has simply such a conservative take on gender, on race, on the politics of HIV.&quot;

In a 2016 retrospective essay about the film, writer Moira Weigel discussed the film&#x27;s impact at the time of its release and legacy. She acknowledged that the film &quot;nails many of the ethnographic details of teen life in New York in the Nineties&quot;. However, she commented on the film&#x27;s depiction of HIV, writing:
 
===Accolades===

*Telly - Nominated Villain

==Documentary==
The documentary &quot;We Were Once Kids&quot; was released in 2021. Directed by Eddie Martin, it explores the film&#x27;s production, as well as the post-film lives of some of the cast. At the time of filming &quot;Kids&quot;, most of the participating teenagers signed a contract without knowledge about their rights and were left on their own after filming ended. The documentary was awarded for Best Editing at the Tribeca Film Festival.

== In popular culture ==
In the Eminem song Guilty Conscience (1999), Dr. Dre exclaims, &quot;Man, ain&#x27;t you ever seen that one movie &quot;Kids&quot;?&quot; The lyric appears in the second verse, a vignette in which Dr. Dre and Eminem weigh in on a man contemplating date rape.

In August 2010, American rapper Mac Miller released the mixtape &quot;K.I.D.S.&quot;, and its cover art, title, and some musical themes pay homage to the film. Some audio clips from the film are also part of the mixtape in between songs.

On the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary in 2015, skateboarding brand Supreme launched a capsule collection commemorating the film. Actors Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter had been involved with Supreme since its incarnation and were part of the brand&#x27;s original skate team.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack was released in 1995.

In September 2023, Folk Implosion, the band composed of Lou Barlow and John Davis, released &quot;Music For Kids&quot;, a compilation of songs from the film, many of which had never been released for streaming, and others that had since become unavailable due to licensing issues. The album included songs that did not make the final cut, and alternate versions of the material present in the film.
Creation of the film&#x27;s soundtrack was overseen by Barlow.

<doc id="615421" wikidata="Q165805" url="?curid=615421" title="Lombard rhythm">
<text>The Lombard rhythm or Scotch snap is a syncopated musical rhythm in which a short, accented note is followed by a longer one. This reverses the pattern normally associated with dotted notes or &quot;notes inégales&quot;, in which the longer value precedes the shorter.

In Baroque music, a Lombard rhythm consists of a stressed sixteenth note, or semiquaver, followed by a dotted eighth note, or dotted quaver.
Baroque composers often implemented these rhythms. For instance, Johann Georg Pisendel utilized Lombard rhythms within the largo and allegro sections of his sonata for Violin Solo in A Minor. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach included dotted rhythms within certain excerpts of his concerto for flute, cello, and keyboard.
Not only did Baroque performers and composers such as Johann Joachim Quantz, introduce these uneven rhythms in their studies and pedagogy, but jazz also possesses these rhythms which are in the very essence of its style.

In Scottish country dances, the Scotch snap (or Scots snap) is a prominent feature of the strathspey.

Due to the immigration of Scots to Appalachia, elements of Scottish music such as the Lombard rhythm have been appropriated into popular music forms of the 20th and 21st century. In modern North American pop and rap music, the Lombard rhythm is very common; recent releases by Post Malone, Cardi B, and Ariana Grande feature the Scotch snap. Grande&#x27;s song ‘7 Rings’ was the subject of controversy surrounding this rhythm, wherein several hip-hop artists (Princess Nokia and Soulja Boy) who had used the rhythm in an iconic fashion raised accusations of plagiarism.

<text>Sir Trevor Colin Mallard (born 17 June 1954) is a New Zealand politician and diplomat. Since 2023, he has served as Ambassador of New Zealand to Ireland. He was a Member of Parliament from 1984 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 2022. He served as Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 2017 until 2022.

Mallard was a Cabinet minister in the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand (1999 to 2008). For six years, he was Minister of Education and Minister of State Services and held additional appointments as Minister for the Environment, Minister of Labour, Minister of Broadcasting, Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Minister for Sport and Recreation and Associate Minister of Finance. He has represented the electorates of Hamilton West, Pencarrow and Hutt South, and was a list member of Parliament between 2017 and 2022.

Mallard&#x27;s five-year term as Speaker completed his parliamentary career. His move into a presiding officer role was likened to &quot;the poacher turned gamekeeper.&quot; Mallard had had a reputation as an &quot;attack dog&quot; and &quot;political battler&quot; (he was once convicted of fighting in a public place after punching National MP Tau Henare at Parliament). His speakership was remarked on for its contribution to parliamentary culture change, including promoting a more family-friendly environment and removing the requirement for male MPs to wear ties. However, some of Mallard&#x27;s comments and actions attracted criticism including in relation to the 2022 Wellington protests.

In February 2023, Mallard took up the role of New Zealand ambassador to Ireland.

==Education and teaching career==
Mallard was born in Wellington, and attended Onslow College. After gaining a Bachelor of Commerce and Administration degree from Victoria University of Wellington in 1974, he trained as a teacher at the Wellington College of Education, gaining a Diploma in Teaching in 1976. He subsequently held a number of teaching jobs in Wellington and the King Country.

While teaching, Mallard became involved in the Post Primary Teachers&#x27; Association (PPTA), the national secondary school teachers&#x27; union. He was secretary of the PPTA&#x27;s King Country branch from 1979 to 1984. In 1984, he gained a Diploma in Continuing Education from the University of Waikato.

==Labour Party activism==
Mallard joined the Labour Party in 1972, while a university student. In 1977 he was arrested in Parliament&#x27;s debating chamber during an anti-SIS bill protest, later appearing in court and the Supreme Court, and was banned from Parliament buildings for a time. He was arrested for disorderly behaviour outside the Springbok rugby team&#x27;s Rotorua hotel during protests against their 1981 tour of New Zealand, but was found not guilty. In 1983 he unsuccessfully contested the Labour nomination for the new Tongariro electorate, losing to Noel Scott.

==Election to Parliament==






===Fourth Labour Government, 1984–1990===
He held a number of internal party positions until the election of 1984 when he defeated Mike Minogue to become the member of Parliament for Hamilton West. In his first term of Parliament, the Labour Party formed a new government and Mallard served as a member off the Justice and Law Reform committee and Regulations Review committee.

Mallard was re-elected in the 1987 election and the Labour government won a second term. Mallard was appointed junior government whip from 1987 to 1990, when he became senior whip. He lost his seat in the election of 1990.

===Fourth National Government, 1993–1999===
After his election loss, Mallard returned to the Wellington area to live and work at parliament as an executive assistant to Mike Moore in the office of the Leader of the Opposition. He set up a new Labour Party branch in Wainuiomata and recruited 70 new members to the party. He then contested the Labour Party nomination in the seat of after Sonja Davies announced her retirement, winning the selection over Eastbourne-based polytechnic lecturer Tricia Thompson. At the he was successful in winning the seat and re-entered parliament. The electorate was renamed Hutt South in 1996, and Mallard retained the seat until 2017 when he opted to become a list MP in a bid to become the Speaker of the House.

As a newly returned member of Parliament, Mallard supported Helen Clark in the 1993 Labour Party leadership contest. He became a senior member of the Labour Party under Clark&#x27;s leadership and Michael Cullen described him as a member of Clark&#x27;s inner circle, which also included Pete Hodgson, Steve Maharey, Phil Goff and Annette King. Clark appointed Mallard to spokesperson roles in portfolios for which he would later hold ministerial responsibility, including sport, state services, and education. As an opposition member of Parliament, Mallard was reappointed to the Justice and Law Reform committee (1993–1994) and appointed to the Government Administration committee (1993–1999).

== Fifth Labour Government, 1999–2008 ==

When Labour won the 1999 election, Mallard was appointed to Cabinet. He became Minister of Education, Minister of State Services, and Minister for Sport and Recreation. In connection with his Education role, he also became Minister Responsible for the Education Review Office, and in connection with his Sport role, he also became Minister for the America&#x27;s Cup (New Zealand held the America&#x27;s Cup at the time). In 2004, Mallard also became Co-ordinating Minister for Race Relations, and Minister of Energy.

In September 2006, Mallard was implicated in the resignation of National Party leader Don Brash after interjecting with an allegation in the House that Brash had engaged in an extramarital affair.

In an October 2007 cabinet reshuffle, he was reassigned to be the Minister for the Environment, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Broadcasting, the Minister for State Owned Enterprises and the Associate Minister of Finance.

In October 2007, Mallard punched National Party MP Tau Henare in a scuffle that took place outside the debating chambers. It is speculated that this was a result of comments Henare made regarding a new relationship Mallard had formed. Mallard quickly apologised for his part in the altercation. He also publicly revealed that the woman with whom he had entered a new relationship was former world champion rower Brenda Lawson. Police declined to investigate but Graham McCready launched a private prosecution. Mallard pleaded guilty to fighting in a public place and agreed to pay $500 to the Salvation Army&#x27;s Bridge drug and alcohol programme.

In May 2008, Mallard was warned by New Zealand&#x27;s Chief Electoral Officer Robert Peden that signage on his electorate vehicle breached provisions of the controversial Electoral Finance Act and ordered him to update the signage to include an authorisation from party officials. However, the Chief Electoral Officer did not refer the matter to the New Zealand Police to prosecute as the matter was considered inconsequential.

=== Minister of Education ===
Mallard&#x27;s handling of the education portfolio was strongly criticised by teachers&#x27; unions, including the PPTA. In his first term as minister, he was strongly criticised by teachers during a long-running strike action over salaries.

In his second term, he was criticised for a programme of school closures, that involved almost 90 schools across the country. The programme was eventually stopped after it faced heavy criticism from parents and teachers.

=== Minister of Sport and Recreation ===
In April 2002, Mallard made crude comments about inserting beer bottles into &quot;uncomfortable places&quot; of International Rugby Board chairman Vernon Pugh and Australian Rugby boss John O&#x27;Neill during a radio interview following the withdrawal of co-hosting rights for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He later apologised saying he mixed up his passion for rugby with his role as Minister of Sport.

=== Minister of State Owned Enterprises ===
In 2006, Mallard announced that the government would introduce a policy that encouraged state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to expand into new business areas and diversify in order to build wealth for the country.

In 2007, Mallard said that the government was likely to be more stringent on state-owned enterprises in relation to social responsibility. Mallard explained that social responsibility is one of the core functions of SOEs but not enough was being done. The announcement was made following a number of incidents by SOEs, including a power disconnection by Mercury Energy that resulted in the death of Folole Muliaga, an individual who relied on an oxygen machine.

=== Minister of Labour ===
In 2008, Mallard implemented a new tool to help small businesses manage hazards. The goal of the project was to improve workplace health and safety.

=== Minister of Broadcasting ===
In July 2008, Mallard was critical of a TVNZ report into an assault by sports broadcaster Tony Veitch, saying that the report lacked key details, such as not mentioning that an assault took place.

== Opposition, 2008–2017 ==
Returning to opposition after the ascent of the Fifth National Government led by John Key in 2008, Mallard was Labour spokesperson for a range of portfolios including animal welfare (2014–2017), internal affairs (2013–2015) and education and labour (2008–2011). He was shadow leader of the House from 2011 to 2013 and was elected an assistant Speaker of the House in 2014.

In February 2012, Mallard was accused of ticket scalping on Trade Me when he sold four tickets to the Homegrown music festival for a $246 profit. As Minister of Economic Development in 2006, Mallard had initiated legislation, the Major Events Management Act 2007, prohibiting ticket scalping for major events (although Homegrown wasn&#x27;t classified as a &quot;major event&quot; so wasn&#x27;t covered). He later offered to refund the money he received for the tickets.

In May 2012, Mallard and fellow Labour MP Andrew Little were sued by National MP and Minister for the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) Judith Collins for defamation over comments they made on the public broadcaster &quot;Radio New Zealand&quot; linking her to the leak of an e-mail from Michelle Boag about an ACC privacy breach. After spending weeks avoiding Collins&#x27; legal team, Mallard received Collins&#x27; legal papers from a woman posing as a constituent. The case was settled by the parties involved following a High Court hearing in November 2012.

In December 2019, former Auditor-General Martin Matthews claimed that Mallard and other members of the Officers of Parliament committee, including then-Speaker David Carter, had pressured him to resign prior to the release of a critical report by Sir Martin Wevers into Matthews&#x27; handling of a NZ$725,000 fraud perpetrated by Ministry of Transport employee Joanne Harrison. At the time, Matthews had served as the head of the Ministry of Transport. Wevers&#x27; report ruled that Matthews was unsuitable for the position of Auditor-General since he had failed to detect Harrison&#x27;s fraud earlier. Matthews disputed the report, alleging that it was full of errors and did not meet the threshold for removing Officers of Parliament. Matthews claimed that Mallard and his fellow MPs had denied him natural justice by not allowing him to respond to alleged inaccuracies in Wevers&#x27; report.

== Speaker of the House, 2017–2022 ==

Following the formation of a Labour-led coalition government with New Zealand First and the Green parties in October 2017, Mallard was elected as Speaker of the House on 7 November following some contention from the opposition National Party over whether several of the new MPs had been sworn in. He also served as Chairperson of several committees including the Business and Officers of Parliament select committees, and the Parliamentary Services Commission.

In November 2017, Mallard announced that the New Zealand Parliament would be becoming more &quot;baby friendly&quot; while posing for a photo with fellow Labour MP Willow-Jean Prime&#x27;s baby Heeni. Such policies have included opening an atrium near the parliamentary chamber accessible to MPs&#x27; children, giving carers and spouses the same security clearances as MPs, opening the Parliamentary swimming pool to the families of MPs and staff, updating the family room to have baby-feeding and changing facilities, and a proposed play area on Parliament&#x27;s lawn. On 22 August 2019, Mallard attracted media attention in New Zealand and abroad when he fed Labour MP Tāmati Coffey&#x27;s infant son Tūtānekai Smith-Coffey during a parliamentary debate.

During the 2020 New Zealand general election, Mallard was re-elected to Parliament on the Labour Party list. When the new Parliament assembled on 25 November, he was re-elected as Speaker without opposition.

After canvassing the views of Members of Parliament in late 2020, Speaker Mallard decided that Parliament would not revise its business attire dress code which required male Members to wear a jacket and tie, as there was &quot;very little support for a change,&quot; though he &quot;personally loathed&quot; ties. On 9 February 2021, Mallard ejected Māori Party Co-Leader Rawiri Waititi from parliamentary proceedings after he defied Parliament&#x27;s business attire rule by wearing a Māori hei tiki neck tie instead of a formal necktie. On 10 February, Mallard announced that ties were no longer compulsory in Parliament following a Standing Orders Committee meeting where the majority voted in favour of the Māori Party&#x27;s submission calling for the elimination of neckties as part of Parliament&#x27;s business attire.

=== Rape allegation remarks, 2019–2020 ===
In late January 2020, Mallard was sued by a parliamentary staff member who alleged that the Speaker had defamed him by claiming in May 2019 that a rapist was working at Parliament. The staff member, who described these remarks as defamatory and untrue, hired Matthew McClelland QC and sought NZ$400,000 in general damages, NZ$50,000 in punitive damages and court costs. In response, Mallard hired the services of a Queen&#x27;s Counsel from Kensington Swan.

On 8 December 2020, Mallard apologised to the staff member and it was announced that both parties considered the matter closed. On 11 December, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; and Stuff reported that the matter had cost public funds NZ$333,000 (including an NZ$185,000 ex-gratia payment to the former staff member and more than $175,000 on legal fees). In response, National Party leader Judith Collins stated that her party had lost confidence in Mallard as Speaker of the House while the New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union called on Mallard to reimburse taxpayers.

On 16 December 2020, Mallard appeared before the Governance and Administration Select Committee where he apologised for calling the former staff member a rapist. It was reported that the staff member was pursuing an employment case against the Parliamentary Service, that had cost NZ$37,500 in legal fees so far. A member of the Taxpayers&#x27; Union dressed in a pig&#x27;s mascot costume also held a mock invoice during the proceedings before being asked to leave due to an objection by Labour MP Duncan Webb.

On 9 February 2021, the National Party unsuccessfully attempted to move a motion of no confidence in Speaker Mallard over the incident. In early May 2021, Mallard drew controversy and media attention when he used parliamentary privilege to claim that the parliamentary staff member whom he had falsely accused of rape committed sexual assault during an exchange with National MPs Chris Bishop and Michael Woodhouse. Prime Minister Ardern criticised Mallard&#x27;s actions as &quot;totally inappropriate&quot; but rejected calls by the National and ACT parties to dismiss him from his position as Speaker.

=== 2022 Wellington protests ===

In mid–February 2022 a large group of mostly anti-mandate protesters established a makeshift camp outside the New Zealand Parliament to protest the Government&#x27;s COVID-19 mitigation and vaccination policies. As Speaker of the House, Mallard was unable to order the protestors to be dispersed by force, so instead responded to their refusal to vacate Parliament&#x27;s grounds by turning sprinklers on full and setting up loud speakers playing copyrighted music and pro-vaccination messages. Despite consulting local residents before he did so (to their approval), Mallard was criticised for his actions by the opposition National and ACT parties. National&#x27;s COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop criticised Mallard for antagonising the protesters further while ACT leader David Seymour remarked that Mallard &quot;seems to be acting like a kid in a very adult situation.&quot;

On 16 February, the National Party said that it intended to lodge a motion of no confidence in Mallard over his handling of the protests and occupation in Wellington.

In early May 2022, Mallard, in his capacity as custodian of the parliamentary grounds, approved Parliament Security&#x27;s issuing of 151 trespass notices against individuals who had participated in the Wellington anti-vaccine mandate protest. Five of these trespass notices were issued to former Members of Parliament; namely former National MP Matt King, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, former ACT leader Rodney Hide, former Māori Party co-leader Marama Fox, and former NZ First list MP Darroch Ball. Following Peters&#x27; threat to seek a judicial review of the trespass notices and media coverage, Mallard withdrew the trespass notices against the five former MPs. In response to the trespass notices against the former MPs, the National and ACT parties renewed their calls for Mallard to be removed as Speaker of the House. Attorney General David Parker welcomed the withdrawal of the trespass notices against the MPs. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern rejected calls to remove Mallard as Speaker and defended his decision to issue the trespass notices.

== Resignation ==
On 13 June 2022, Ardern confirmed that Mallard would resign from his position as Speaker of the House in mid-August 2022 to take up a diplomatic post in Europe. The Prime Minister also designated fellow Labour MP and Deputy Speaker Adrian Rurawhe as his successor. His resignation, along with that of Immigration and Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi, triggered a cabinet reshuffle within the Labour Government. Mallard&#x27;s resignation announcement followed renewed criticism by the opposition National, Māori, and ACT parties over his decision to issue trespass notices against five former MPs.

On 24 August 2022, Mallard&#x27;s resignation as Speaker of the House took effect. The day before, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta formally announced his appointment as the second resident ambassador of New Zealand to Ireland, which he assumed in January 2023. Fellow Labour MP and Deputy Speaker Adrian Rurawhe was elected as the new Speaker of the House. During speeches following Rurawhe&#x27;s election, former Labour MP Gaurav Sharma used parliamentary privilege to accuse Mallard of ignoring his concerns about bullying in Parliament and refusing to provide legal support for his case. Sharma also alleged that Mallard had informed the Labour Whips office about Sharma&#x27;s complaint against the party and whips. Mallard denied Sharma&#x27;s allegations.

Mallard gave his valedictory speech to Parliament on 20 October 2022, and his resignation as a list MP took effect at the end of that day.

==Diplomatic career==
In mid October 2022, Newshub reported that Mallard&#x27;s new position as New Zealand Ambassador to Ireland had a salary between NZ$180,000 and NZ$250,000. In addition, Mallard was entitled to accommodation and two trips home over the three-year appointment. In response, ACT Party leader David Seymour criticised Mallard&#x27;s diplomatic appointment as an example of &quot;bad behaviour&quot; being rewarded.

In the 2024 New Year Honours, Mallard was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a member of Parliament and as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

==Personal life==
Mallard announced his separation from wife Stephanie in June 2007 after 33 years of marriage. He has three children, one of whom is a Black Fern, Beth Mallard. On 29 December 2014, Mallard married journalist Jane Clifton. He is interested in outdoor recreation, including rugby and mountain biking.

<text>These are the [[Billboard Hot 100|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100]] number-one hits of 1984. Overall, Prince spent the most weeks at number one in 1984, reigning for seven weeks at the top with &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; (with the Revolution). However, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna had the longest run at number one of any song which rose into the top position during 1984. Though it spent only two weeks at number one at the end of the year, it went on to spend an additional four weeks at the top to begin 1985, for a total of six weeks.

That year, 15 acts achieved their first number one song, such as Yes, Culture Club, Van Halen, Kenny Loggins, Phil Collins, Cyndi Lauper, Duran Duran, Prince, Ray Parker Jr., Tina Turner, John Waite, The Revolution, Billy Ocean, Wham!, and Madonna. Prince was the only act to hit number one more than once that year, with two.

<doc id="615438" wikidata="Q3100503" url="?curid=615438" title="General Mining Act of 1872">
<text>The General Mining Act of 1872 is a United States federal law that authorizes and governs prospecting and mining for economic minerals, such as gold, platinum, and silver, on federal public lands. This law, approved on May 10, 1872, codified the informal system of acquiring and protecting mining claims on public land, formed by prospectors in California and Nevada from the late 1840s through the 1860s, such as during the California Gold Rush.
All citizens of the United States of America 18 years or older have the right under the 1872 mining law to locate a lode (hard rock) or placer (gravel) mining claim on federal lands open to mineral entry. These claims may be located once a discovery of a locatable mineral is made. Locatable minerals include but are not limited to platinum, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, uranium and tungsten.

==Western miners&#x27; codes==

Miners and prospectors in the California Gold Rush of 1849 found themselves in a legal vacuum. Although the US federal government had laws governing the leasing of mineral land, the United States had only recently acquired California by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and had little presence in the newly acquired territories.

Miners organized their own governments in each new mining camp (for example the Great Republic of Rough and Ready), and adopted the Mexican mining laws then existing in California that gave the discoverer right to explore and mine gold and silver on public land. Miners moved from one camp to the next, and made the rules of all camps more or less the same, usually differing only in specifics such as in the maximum size of claims, and the frequency with which a claim had to be worked to avoid being forfeited and subject to being claimed by someone else. California miners spread the concept all over the west with each new mining rush, and the practices spread to all the states and territories west of the Great Plains.

==Mining legislation before 1872==
Although the practices for open mining on public land were more-or-less universal in the West, and supported by state and territorial legislation, they were still illegal under existing federal law. At the end of the American Civil War, some eastern congressmen regarded western miners as squatters who were robbing the public patrimony, and proposed seizure of the western mines to pay the huge war debt. In June 1865, Representative George Washington Julian of Indiana introduced a bill for the government to take the western mines from their discoverers, and sell them at public auction. Representative Fernando Wood proposed that the government send an army to California, Colorado, and Arizona to expel the miners &quot;by armed force if necessary to protect the rights of the Government in the mineral lands.&quot; He advocated that the federal government itself work the mines for the benefit of the treasury.

Western representatives successfully argued that western miners and prospectors were performing valuable services by promoting commerce and settling new territory. In 1864, Congress passed a law that instructed courts deciding questions of contested mining rights to ignore federal ownership, and defer to the miners in actual possession of the ground. The following year, Congressional supporters of western miners tacked legislation legalizing lode (hardrock) mining on public land onto a law regarding ditch and canal rights in California, Oregon, and Nevada. The legislation, known as the &quot;Chaffee laws&quot; after Colorado Territorial representative Jerome B. Chaffee, passed and was signed on July 26, 1866.

Congress extended similar rules to placer mining claims in the &quot;placer law&quot; signed into law on July 9, 1870.

==The Mining Law of 1872==
The Chaffee law of 1869 and the placer law of 1871 were combined into the General Mining Act of 1872. The mining law of 1866 had given discoverers rights to stake mining claims to extract gold, silver, cinnabar (the principal ore of mercury) and copper. When Congress passed the General Mining Act of 1872, the wording was changed to &quot;or other valuable deposits,&quot; giving greater scope to the law. The 1872 law was codified as 30 U.S.C. §§ 22-42

The 1872 act also granted extralateral rights to lode claims, and fixed the maximum size of lode claims as 1500 feet (457m) long and 600 feet (183m) wide.

The Act of 1872 also set the price for land assumed under the mining act:

FORTY-SECOND CONGRESS. Sess. II Ch. 152. 1872. (approved July ninth, eighteen hundred and seventy) a patent shall issue for the placer-claim, including such vein or lode, upon the payment of five dollars per acre such vein or lode claim, and twenty-five feet of surface on each side thereof. The reminder of the placer-claim, or any placer-claim not embracing any vein or lode claim, shall be paid for at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents per acre, together with all costs of proceedings;.
It set the price of the land claim to range $2.50 to $5.00 per acre. This price set by law has remained the same since 1872.

Investors in an alleged diamond deposit in the western United States that became known as the Diamond Hoax of 1872 paid Benjamin F. Butler for amending the General Mining Act of 1872 to include the terms &quot;valuable mineral deposits&quot; in order to allow legal mining claims in the diamond fields.

==Volume and worth==
The Mineral Policy Center estimates that mining companies extract $2 billion to $3 billion in minerals from public lands every year. From 1872 to 1993, mining companies produced more than $230 billion from lands claimed under the Act, according to the Mineral Policy Center.

==Terminology==
A mining claim is the right to explore for and extract minerals from a tract of land.

Claim staking is the required procedure of marking the boundaries of the mining claim, typically with wooden posts or substantial piles of rocks. Each western state has slightly different requirements for claim staking. Once the claim is staked, the prospector documents the claim by filing required forms. Originally the forms were filed with the mining district recorder; today they are filed with the Clerk of the County in which the claim is located, and with the US Bureau of Land Management. Papers are likewise filed to document annual assessment work.

A lode claim, also known in California as a quartz claim, is a claim over a hard rock deposit.

A placer claim is a claim over gold-bearing sand or gravel, often along a stream or river.

The mining law opens up land in the public domain, that is, federal land that has been owned by the federal government since it became part of the United States, and that has never been set aside for a specific use. Land dedicated for specific uses such as the White House lawn, national parks, or wilderness areas, is not subject to mineral entry. Land west of the Great Plains managed by the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management, unless designated as wilderness area, is generally open to mining claims. Federal land on or east of the Great Plains was generally acquired by the federal government through purchase, and so is not considered public domain, and is not subject to mining claims.

The mining law applies to some mineral products, but not others, and the list has changed over time. Since 1920, the list of locatable minerals does not include petroleum, coal, phosphate, sodium, and potassium. Rights to explore for and extract these are leased through competitive bidding. Common construction material such as sand and gravel are obtained by purchase.

All mining claims are initially unpatented claims, which give the right only for those activities necessary to exploration and mining, and last only as long as the claim is worked every year. For instance, the failure to prosecute the work on the tunnel for six months is considered the abandonment of rights to all the undiscovered veins on the line of the tunnels. In addition, at least $100 worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made annually. If this does not occur, the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be made to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made. The original mining law gave miners the opportunity to obtain &quot;patents&quot; (deeds from the government), much as farmers could obtain title under the Homestead Act. The owner of a patented claim can put it to any legal use. The process of patenting claims has been perhaps the most controversial part of the mining law. Because of a Congress-imposed moratorium, the federal government has not accepted any new applications for mining claim patents since October 1, 1994.

The 1872 law granted extra lateral rights to owners of lode claims. This gave the owners of the surface outcrop of a vein the right to follow and mine the vein wherever it led, even if its subsurface extension continued beneath other mining claims. This provision, also known as the law of the apex led to lengthy litigation and even underground battles, especially in Butte, Montana, and the Comstock Lode.

==Subsequent amendments==
The acquisition of mining rights on public land in the West is mostly governed by the 1872 act. Subsequent changes to the law include:
* Timber and Stone Act, an 1878 law that allowed private purchase of minable government land was codified as 43 U.S.C. §§ 311, 313, but subsequently repealed;
* the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. §§ 181 et. seq., which made certain nonmetallic minerals, such as petroleum and oil shale, not open to claim staking;
* the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, 30 U.S.C. § 601, et. seq., which provides for the sale or public giveaway of certain minerals, such as sand or gravel;
* the Multiple Mineral Use Act of 1954 (Multiple Mineral Development Act), 30 U.S.C. Ch. 12, which provided for the development of multiple minerals on the same tracts of public land;
* the Multiple Surface Use Mining Act of 1955, 30 U.S.C. § 611, which withdrew common varieties from mineral entry; and
* the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. § 1744, part of which redefines claim recording procedures and provides for abandonment if the procedures are not followed.
* Since 1 October 1994 Congress has imposed budget restrictions which have prevented the Bureau of Land Management from accepting new applications for patents on mining claims.

Provisions of the 1872 Mining Law were changed with the implementation of the 1976 Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA) effective as of January 1981. Many of the provisions of FLPMA revised the surface uses allowed on mining claims under the 1872 mining law by halting or restricting unnecessary or undue degradation of the public lands. The regulation portion of the FLPMA is found at 43 CFR 3809 (&quot;Surface Management regulations&quot;). These regulations were updated and the final rules published in December 2001. These rules effectively replace many of the 1872 Mining Law provisions and require mining reclamation, financial guarantees for reclamation to the Federal government, mining claim occupation permits and detailed Mining Plans of Operations to be submitted to the governing agencies before disturbing the surface.

===Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007===
On November 1, 2007, the US House passed the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 () by a vote of 244–116. The bill would have permanently ended new patents for mining claims, imposed a royalty of 4% of gross revenues on existing mining extracting from unpatented mining claims, and placed an 8% royalty on new mining operations. Mining of private mineral rights (including patented mining claims) would not have been affected. Seventy percent of the royalty money would have gone to a cleanup fund for past abandoned mining operations, and 30% to affected communities. The National Mining Association maintained that, in combination with existing federal, state, and local taxes, the royalty imposed by the bill would have burdened US mining with the highest effective tax rate in the world. The bill was not acted upon by the Senate, and died at the end of the 110th Congress in January 2009.

===Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009===
The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009 was introduced in the US Senate by Jeff Bingaman (D-New Mexico), but died in committee.

The proposed bill provided that the secretary of the interior will establish a royalty rate of from 8% to 15% of the value of locateable mineral production from any new mines on federal mineral lands. Mines in production on the date of the bill&#x27;s enactment would not be subject to the royalty. In addition, a reclamation tax of from 0.3% to 1%, the rate set by the secretary of the interior, would be levied on all hardrock mining operations, new and existing, on federal, state, private, and tribal lands. The royalties and reclamation taxes would be used to reclaim abandoned hardrock mines.

The proposed legislation was backed by the Obama administration. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar stated &quot;There is a new administration in town, and we want to see the 1872 mining law reformed.&quot; However, in 2010, Senate majority leader, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), who was thought to oppose the bill as written, announced that, due to other legislative priorities, the bill would not be acted upon before Congress adjourned, and so the bill died at the end of the 111th United States Congress in January 2011.

=== Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2014 ===
The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2014 was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) on July 10, 2014. Rep. Peter DeFazio stated &quot;For over 140 years, the federal government has allowed mining companies to extract hundreds of billions of dollars&#x27; worth of valuable publicly owned minerals from our public lands without paying American taxpayers a single dime.&quot; This bill was built off of the previous Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.

The proposed bill would have prohibited patent grants from all mining or millsites claimed after September 30, 1994. The bill would have established a maintenance fee and a 4% to 8% royalty of the gross incomes of all unpatented mining or millsite claims.

The bill would have also assigned protections to lands, such as areas of wilderness study and areas of environmental concern, that would no longer be open to mining and millsite claims. In addition, the bill would have created the Hardrock Minerals Fund, which would require a payment to the Secretary of the Interior of 7 cents per ton of displaced mining material, paid for by all operators of a hardrock mining site. These funds would then be allocated to land and water resources that were impacted negatively by mining operations.

The proposed bill, however, died at the end of the 113th Congress in January 2015.

=== Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015 ===
The Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015 was introduced to the 114th Congress by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Arizona) on February 13, 2015. This proposed bill was built off of the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2014. The bill died in committee.

=== Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2015 ===
The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2015 was introduced to the 114th Congress by Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico) on November 5, 2015.

Sen. Tom Udall stated that the Gold King Mine spill of 2015, which spilled 3 million gallons of acid wastewater into the Animas River watershed, was a key factor in introducing the bill. Sen. Udall introduced the bill as a way to make mine operators responsible for mine spills and stated &quot;We cannot wait for more disasters like the Gold King mine spill for us to act. We cannot continue to do nothing while thousands of abandoned hardrock mines drain toxic metals into our rivers, water supplies, and our drinking water each and every day.&quot;

The proposed bill, built upon the Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015, included a specified maintenance fee of all unpatented claims, with a $150 fee for each claim along with a $50 location fee. The bill adjusted the percentage of royalties collected from mining production to between 2% and 5% and stated that all mining operators are required to present to the Secretary of the Interior the financial ability to pay for any damages to any land and water resources affected by mining. The bill proposed the establishment of the Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund and a requirement that all mining operators pay a fee of 0.6% to 2% of the annual production value of each mine. The bill died in the 114th Congress.

=== Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2017 ===
The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2017 was introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico) on September 9, 2017.

The bill proposed builds off of the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2015 and requires the Secretary of the Interior to set the percentage of royalties to be collected from mining productions. The bill died in the 115th Congress.

<doc id="615439" wikidata="Q4746130" url="?curid=615439" title="Amici Forever">
<text>Amici Forever is a band of four classically trained singers who mix opera with pop music (operatic pop). The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Opera Band&quot; (2004), reached number one on the Australian classical charts, number two on the United States (US) classical charts and the top 5 in the United Kingdom (UK) classical charts.

==History==
The members of Amici Forever met when rehearsing and performing at opera venues around the world. The band currently features a tenor, a baritone, and two soprano singers. In 2002 tenor Geoff Sewell, originally from New Zealand, alongside renowned classical crossover manager Nadia Raibin came up with the idea of an &quot;opera band&quot; mixing traditional opera with contemporary pop. One of the original five members, Nick Garrett, a bass-baritone, left the group in August 2005 to pursue a solo career, shortly after the release of &quot;Defined&quot;. Tenor Geoff Sewell left the group in February 2006 after his daughter Sienna was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This was just after the highly successful tour of Australia and New Zealand. Amici Forever have celebrated two No 1 albums with &quot;The Opera Band&quot; and &quot;Defined&quot; in Geoff Sewell&#x27;s homeland of New Zealand. He was replaced with Brazilian Italian baritone Bruno Santino. On 20 September 2006 it was announced on the Amici Forever website that Jo Appleby would be leaving the group to pursue a career as a solo artist. Lucy van Gasse was introduced as the newest member of Amici in February 2007.

Amici Forever signed with Arista Records and started playing high-profile gigs such as the FA Cup, the UEFA Champions League final in 2003 and the English rugby union final. Nick Patrick, who had produced albums by the Gipsy Kings, Tina Turner and Marvin Gaye produced the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Opera Band&quot;.

&quot;The Opera Band&quot; was released on 13 January 2004 and soon reached number 74 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts and the top 50 of the ARIA Australian album charts. The album has also reached number 2 on the Billboard Classical Crossover and Heatseeker charts. It became number one on the ARIA Australian classical album chart, as well as the top 5 on the UK classical charts. In addition it peaked at #39 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was nominated for &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Classical Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 May 2004 where they also performed the album&#x27;s signature song &#x27;Prayer in the Night&#x27;, composed by James Shearman based on Handel&#x27;s Sarabande, with lyrics by Sam Babenia.

===Members===

As of February 2007, the band consisted of: 
* Lucy van Gasse (England) (soprano), born in Nailsea, a little town just outside Bristol. She has a Bachelor of Music from Cardiff University and a Master of Music from Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.
* Tsakane Valentine Maswanganyi (soprano), born in Johannesburg, South Africa. She studied music at Pretoria University and had operatic training at the University of Tshwane. She appeared in performances for Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and starred as Maria (the lead role) in West Side Story for Spier Opera Company in Cape Town. 
* David Habbin (tenor), born in Fordingbridge, Hampshire. He spent several years writing and performing with Pop rock bands. He then began vocal training with international operatic tenor, Jon Andrew. He completed his studies of acting and musical theatre at Mountview Theatre School in North London. He was in performances of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; on tour and in west London before finishing his operatic training at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. David then performed with different UK opera companies, one of which was the Glyndebourne Festival Opera for their Summer Festival and touring company.
* Bruno Santino (baritone), born in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Santino originally studied chemical engineering. After being invited to sing in six different choirs, he decided to start learning music instead and began at CEFAR Music School. Bruno won scholarships to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and completed a master&#x27;s degree in Music Performance there, as well as a Post Graduate Diploma in Vocal Training with distinction.

<text>Lois Wendland Banner (born 1939) is an American author and emeritus professor of history at the University of Southern California. She is one of the earliest academics to focus on women&#x27;s history in the United States. Her work includes biographies of Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, Marilyn Monroe and Greta Garbo as well as the textbook &quot;Women in Modern America: A Brief History.&quot;

She was born Lois Wendland on July 26, 1939, in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Harry J. and Melba Wendland.

She received her doctorate of philosophy from Columbia University in 1970. Her doctoral dissertation was on religious benevolence and reform in the antebellum era. Realizing the many women who were leaders in that movement pointed her towards women’s history when she taught in the History Department of Douglass College of Rutgers University. While at Douglass she wrote the textbook &quot;Women in Modern America: A Brief History&quot;, which is commonly used in introductory Women&#x27;s Studies classes at the university level. Commencing with the second edition she included scholarship on race, class, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Banner subsequently taught at Princeton, George Washington University, Stanford University, the University of Scranton, Hamilton College and UCLA before achieving tenure and a full professorship at the University of Southern California in History and Gender and Sexuality Studies. 

In 1983, she released &quot;American Beauty&quot; about which scholar Ann Douglas of Columbia University wrote: &quot;Banner is alert to several interesting aspects of the story that she chronicles. She sees the matter of the definition and marketing of beauty as a complex process: those involved were able to impose their high valuation of female good looks on a public that already equated beauty with femininity, yet they were unable to stabilize and market a single type of beauty.&quot; 

In 1992 Banner published &quot;In Full Flower: Aging Women, Power, and Sexuality&quot; about which &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted: “This is a masterwork of scholarship and a milestone in our understanding of how Western civilization has demeaned the older woman. … Like an archeologist, the author sifts through myth, literature and history--her Rosetta stone, the film Sunset Boulevard. … Banner turns to African American women for positive middle-aged and elder role models in a study that helps set the historical record straight.”

Banner later wrote about the intellectual history of the United States and anthropology&#x27;s place in that story with her 2003 book &quot;Intertwined Lives: Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Their Circle&quot;: &quot;By focusing on the interplay of Benedict, Mead, their husbands, friends, lovers, and protégés, [Banner] takes readers well beyond the two women’s published work and shows the genesis of their thoughts on human plasticity, diversity, potential, configurations, and patterns, all pearls on a string of shared ideas.&quot;

In &quot;Marilyn: The Passion and the Paradox&quot; she focused on the iconic American actress with an unusual angle: “Banner is less interested in definitively collapsing the poles than in teasing out the contradictions and underlying motives of a complex character. She takes us through Marilyn’s nomadic childhood to her breakthrough in Hollywood and her storybook marriage to Joe DiMaggio, to her escape to Miller and acting classes in New York, to her brief and ultimately tragic return to Hollywood,&quot; wrote Zoë Slutzky of the &quot;New York Times&quot;.
She also published a book on spiritual communes in the 1970s and their connection to Christian religions and Islam, in &quot;Finding Fran&quot; (Columbia University Press, 1989). Her many awards include the Bode-Pearson Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Studies Association, of which she was the first female President. 

In 1973 she and Mary S. Hartman founded the now triennial Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, Genders, and Sexualities, run by the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians. They also edited the proceedings of that conference, &quot;Clio’s Consciousness Raised: New Perspectives on the History of Women&quot; (1974), the first academic edited collection in women&#x27;s history. 

At 84 years old, Banner made racist public comments at the 2023 Berkshire conference that resulted in condemnation from the audience and on social media. During a speech, Banner, an 84 year old white woman, wished she was black, claiming it would have made her career easier.

<doc id="615462" wikidata="Q8073104" url="?curid=615462" title="Zmudowski State Beach">
<text>Zmudowski State Beach is located on Monterey Bay, in Moss Landing, Monterey County, northern California.

It is operated by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Coastal erosion has greatly affected Zmudowski State Beach, along with other beaches in California. It has also been impacted by an influx of marine debris, causing changes in its wildlife populations.

==Recreation==
Zmudowski State Beach is a popular fishing area and tourist attraction. Some of the fish found in this location are the perch, kingfish, sole, flounder, halibut, bocaccio (tomcod), jacksmelt, lingcod, cabezon, salmon, steelhead, and occasional rockfish. The beach features the Pajaro River estuary, where a natural preserve has been set aside for nature and wildlife exploring. Families go to this state beach to picnic and use the beach area. The sandy beach is also popular with bird watchers and equestrians. Horses are only allowed near the waterline. Swimming and water sports such as surfing are hazardous because of strong rip-currents.

The beach is located 20 miles northwest of Monterey, off Highway 1. It is accessible via Giberson Road, a two-mile narrow road through agricultural fields.

==History==
The beach is named after Watsonville schoolteacher Mary Zmudowski, who donated it to the State of California in the 1950s. It is pronounced &quot;zhmud-UV-ski.&quot; The state of California obtained a 155-acre parcel from Mary Zmudowski in 1950, which included 9,124 feet of land beside the ocean. The Park Commission changed the name of the park from &quot;Pajaro River&quot; to Zmudowski in 1952 in order to recognize the contribution the family made. This beach has always been a secret attraction to the Monterey Area. People from all over can come to participate in recreational activities.

==Geography==
Because of the location of Zmudowski State Beach, in Moss Landing, coastal upwelling plays a large part on the beach in the spring and summer. Winds from the north, along the coast blow south past Monterey, causing the surface water to be pushed away, and the water from underneath to rise, or &quot;upwell,&quot; and replace the surface water with nutrient rich water. This is why Zmudowski State Beach is such a great place to fish—the water has high biological productivity.
Upwelling has fluctuated significantly in the past two decades, effecting the fishing and wildlife at Zmudowski State Beach. The strong spring and summer upwellings have brought much plankton and a variety of fishes.

==Wildlife==
The water upwelling at Zmudowski State Beach has affected wildlife, particularly the fish population. Certain nutrients from the water rise to the surface, and stimulate high plankton productivity of the Monterey Bay region. The high nutrient content, salinity and density make this area attractive to anglers, year-round. Accordingly, Zmudowski State Beach is ranked a three star as a popular fishing destination. However, there have been laws and regulations set up to protect the fish population so on a daily basis, one can catch only 20 fish in combination of all other species, with not more than 10 fish of one species.

==Coastal erosion==
Coastal erosion has greatly impacted Zmudowski State Beach, and poses many threats to the structure and to the community of the beach. Erosion rates along the southern Monterey Bay shoreline between Moss Landing and Wharf II in Monterey are the highest in California. Unfortunately, the Zmudowski State Beach is diminishing about 2 feet per year. Rules governing proper techniques when building near the beach have been put in place in order to minimize damage from coastal erosion.

==Pajaro River estuary==
Zmudowski State Beach also features the Pajaro River estuary, where a nature preserve exists. An estuary is quite simply a body of water formed where freshwater from rivers and streams flows into the ocean, mixing with the seawater. Estuaries and tidal wetland systems are some of the most productive and adaptive of Earth’s ecosystems. This area surrounding the beach is a tidal wetland, but back 10,000 years ago it was not. The rising sea levels drowned the valley. Thousands of years later, sediment deposition transformed this area into an estuary. The transformation of the land into wetland and marsh actually began after the California Gold Rush.

When the Americans arrived, they cut down many trees to clear the land, and sediment continued to transform the wetland. 
Between 1870 and 1956, many levees were constructed within the Zmudowski Beach Region and near the Pajaro Estuary. The area, mostly salt marsh, decreased by 66% due to the levees. However, the benefit of salt marsh loss was the increase of four habitat types. When the early twentieth century came, more than 90 salt marshes were altered into habitats that man made ponds and marshes containing fresh water. In the mid-twentieth century the salt marshes continued to decline and were replaced with unvegetated mudflat. By the late 1950s, almost all the salt marshes left were drained and used for agriculture.

==2014 closure proposal==
In 2014, the State of California had planned to close 70 state parks to cut money from the State Park system budget. Zmudowski State Beach was saved from being cut because it required little money to maintain. In 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that allowed $10 million to be used for the State Park system. This money was important for two Monterey County Parks, Zmudowski State Beach and Moss Landing State Beach, since they both received no donations.

<text>Robert Russell Bennett (June 15, 1894 – August 18, 1981) was an American composer and arranger, best known for his orchestration of many well-known Broadway and Hollywood musicals by other composers such as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers.

In 1957 and 2008, Bennett received special Tony Awards recognizing his orchestrations for Broadway shows. Early in his career, he was often billed as Russell Bennett.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Robert Russell Bennett was born in 1894 to a musical family in Kansas City, Missouri. His father, George Bennett, played violin in the Kansas City Symphony and trumpet at the Grand Opera House, while his mother, May, worked as a pianist and teacher. She taught Bennett piano, while his father taught him violin and trumpet.

The Bennett family moved to a farm in Freeman, Missouri, when Bennett was four, to speed his recovery from polio. He graduated as the Valedictorian of Freeman High School. By that time, he had demonstrated his aptitude for music and his remarkable ear by picking out the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot; Sonata on the white keys of the piano. By his early adolescence, his father often called upon him to play any given instrument as a utility member or substitute player within Bennett&#x27;s Band in Freeman.

In his autobiography, Bennett recalled finding a ragtime tune on the piano at age ten and being informed by his mother that such music was trash—this lesson taught him to be, as he called it, a &quot;life-long musical snob&quot;. His mother also taught his academic lessons until he was twelve due to health concerns; his health remained an obstacle when Bennett later decided to join the Army.

===Early career===

After completing his secondary education, Bennett moved to Kansas City to be a freelance musician, performing throughout the city as well as with the symphony. He also began his first musical training outside of a home environment with Danish composer-conductor Dr. Carl Busch. Busch taught him counterpoint and harmony until 1916, when Bennett took his savings and moved to New York City. He eventually found a job as a copyist with G. Schirmer while continuing to freelance and to build a network of contacts, particularly with the New York Flute Club.

In 1917 he volunteered for the Army. Although he yearned for an active role, his youthful health woes caused the draft board to mark him for limited service. However, he successfully appealed this classification and became the director of the 70th Infantry Band at Camp Funston, Kansas. He valiantly attempted to improve the &quot;disgraceful&quot; musical standards of the unit, but found his efforts thwarted when the Spanish flu swept through the post in 1918.

Upon his discharge several months later, he returned to New York. His relationship with Winifred Edgerton Merrill, a society matron who had been the first woman to receive a doctorate from Columbia University, led to rewards both financial and emotional—she had been one of his first employers in the city, and she introduced him to her daughter Louise, whom he married on December 26, 1919. Their daughter, Jean, was born a year later. Bennett later studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger 1926-1929.

===Broadway arranger===
His career as an arranger began to blossom in 1919 while he was employed by T.B. Harms, a prominent publishing firm for Broadway and Tin Pan Alley. Dependable yet creative within the confines of formulaic arranging, Bennett soon branched out as an orchestrator and arranger for Broadway productions, collaborating particularly with Jerome Kern.

Although Bennett would work with several of the top names on Broadway and in film including George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Kurt Weill, his collaborations with Jerome Kern and Richard Rodgers stand out both for sheer volume and for highlighting different facets of an arranger&#x27;s relationship with a composer. Bennett described his own philosophy: &quot;The perfect arrangement is one that manages to be most &#x27;becoming&#x27; to the melody at all points.&quot;

;With Jerome Kern
Kern&#x27;s working relationship with Bennett serves as a clear illustration of this point. For example, when orchestrating &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Bennett would work from sketches laid out quite specifically by Kern, which included melodies, rough parts, and harmonies. The original sketches appear remarkably close to Bennett&#x27;s completed scores; as one scholar puts it, &quot;Bennett didn&#x27;t have much to make up.&quot;

;With Richard Rodgers
In contrast, Rodgers allowed Bennett a greater degree of autonomy. The pair had first collaborated in 1927, but the majority of their partnership occurred in the 1940s and 1950s. While scoring &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943, Bennett proved himself invaluable by reworking an elaborate and possibly out-of-place selection into the title song. His most legendary contribution to the partnership, however, occurred during the scoring of the television series &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; (1952–53).

Richard Rodgers contributed twelve basic themes for the series, with three earmarked for the first episode; Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; manuscripts total seventeen pages. The Rodgers themes total about twelve minutes of music, and are employed by Bennett in a bit more than two hours of the series&#x27; scoring, which amounts to more than 11-1/2 hours of orchestra music.

Rodgers commented on Bennett&#x27;s Victory at Sea contributions: &quot;I give him [the credit] without undue modesty, for making my music sound better than it was.&quot;

;With George Gershwin
With Gershwin and his Broadway musical scores, Bennett would work from annotated short scores (dual folios for piano with general suggestions for which instruments would play what.) He worked very closely as Gershwin&#x27;s assistant during the period in which Gershwin composed his score for the 1937 Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film, &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, often spending late nights with Gershwin rushing to complete orchestrations for deadlines. The next year Gershwin died. Later Bennett would be turned to yet again as a definitive orchestrator of Gershwin&#x27;s other works, both on Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture and the orchestral medley, &quot;Gershwin in Hollywood&quot;.

===Other commissions===
Sergei Rachmaninoff was engaged in writing a 2-piano reduction of his Piano Concerto No. 4, containing his final revisions, when death overtook him. Robert Russell Bennett completed the reduction at the request of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s widow.

===Musical profile===
Schooled by his mother to disdain popular music, Robert Russell Bennett found the dichotomy between his serious compositions and his arranging work to be a lifelong struggle. In spite of his prolific output, which included the opera &quot;Maria Malibran&quot;, more than seven symphonies, a large variety of chamber works, and at least five concertos, his reputation today as a classical composer rests primarily on two oft-recorded pieces, the Suite of Old American Dances and Symphonic Songs for Band.

This may be attributed both to the modesty so characteristic of Bennett and to the Eastman Wind Ensemble recordings which popularized them. In his composing, Bennett brought to bear his considerable talent for orchestration as well as a gift for conceiving melodies and harmonic structure in his head; longtime Bennett copyist Adele Combattente (of Chappell Music) confirmed his ability to write parts in score order, as opposed to filling in leftover parts and doublings as he completed primary melodic lines. He nearly always scored directly in ink, rather than pencil.

Many of Bennett&#x27;s original works came about through direct commission; the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, CBS radio (&quot;Hollywood&quot; for orchestra), and the League of Composers (&quot;Mademoiselle&quot; for the Goldman Band) provide prominent examples. A significant number of commissions were initiated by Robert Austin Boudreau, a former member of the Goldman Band, and his American Wind Symphony.

The AWS traveled via American rivers and waterways, inspiring several works with nautical themes, including the Ohio River Suite and West Virginia Epic. Boudreau would provide a basic concept to Bennett, who would complete the new work rapidly and who would always attend the premiere. Boudreau recalls, &quot;We never offered him a lot of money for those commissions...He was an elegant person. He was always more interested in music than in dollars.&quot;

Many works were written for his musical acquaintances, including &quot;Hexapoda&quot; and a concerto for violinist Louis Kaufman, &quot;Tema Sporca con Variazoni&quot; for duo-pianists Appleton and Field, Suite for Flute and B flat Clarinet for Frances Blaisdell and Alex Williams, and the Rondo Capriccioso for Georges Barrére (Bennett&#x27;s friendship with flutists William Kincaid and John Wummer prompted other chamber works).

In 1960, he conducted the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series.

==Later years and legacy==

In later years, Bennett again developed major health problems. &quot;He never talked about it, but always showed joy,&quot; Boudreau states. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just a business relationship we had, it was more than just music. We were pals, and he would treat me as a son.&quot;

Bennett did not slow his output, creating original works for the nation&#x27;s bicentennial celebrations and accepting commissions from a variety of sources, including a Presbyterian church in Florida, for which he accepted only a modest fee.

==Death==

Bennett died of liver cancer in 1981, aged 87. His legacy rests largely on the popular arrangements which so conflicted the composer, but those who knew him also remember him as a close friend and gracious mentor. Robert Shaw wrote, &quot;And it is just as certainly because of his kindness, honesty, humor, and wisdom that our hearts are warmed to see Robert Russell Bennett without peer in his field.&quot;

Bennett mentored Broadway and concert arranger William David Brohn; they first worked together on the 1966 Lincoln Center revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

Bennett also did the orchestrations for the 1936 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, and for the 1955 film version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Some of his stage orchestrations were used in the 1958 film version of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and the 1956 film version of &quot;The King and I&quot; and by Irwin Kostal for the 1965 film version of &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot;

He conducted Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; which was the soundtrack for the early 1950s TV documentary series of the same name; it was one of the first of its kind and billed as one most ambitious. RCA Victor released 5 volumes of music from the Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; score, all conducted by Robert Russell Bennett with cover art by Victor Kalin. (Vol. 1 - LM-2335; Vol. 2 - LM-2226; Vol.3 - ANL 1-1432; Three Suites; Video Disk)

He also orchestrated the score for the original television broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1957.

===Concert arrangements===
In 1942, Bennett arranged &quot;Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture&quot; as configured by conductor Fritz Reiner, using melodies from George Gershwin&#x27;s now-celebrated opera. Bennett&#x27;s arrangements were largely based on Gershwin&#x27;s original orchestrations for the opera.

Bennett was also responsible for &quot;The Many Moods of Christmas&quot;, a 1963 48-minute medley of Christmas carols, arranged especially for the Robert Shaw Chorale and Orchestra. They recorded it that year, and in 1983, Robert Shaw re-recorded it with the Atlanta Symphony Chorus and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.

Among his published orchestra medleys for Broadway shows (including some for which others had done the original pit orchestrations) are those for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Allegro&quot;, &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Roberta&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, and &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, as well as extended &quot;symphonic picture&quot; settings of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

His concert band medleys include those of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Carousel Waltzes&quot;, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Gigi&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot;

The 40-minute &quot;Porgy and Bess: Concert Version&quot; for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and orchestra was prepared in 1956. It is based very closely on Gershwin&#x27;s original instrumental and vocal scoring, the principal recasting being the use of standard concert-orchestra instrumentation, and eliminating the clarinet-saxophone doubling specified in Gershwin&#x27;s 1935 orchestration.

==Awards and honors==
The Tony Award for orchestrations has only existed since 1997; Bennett was given a Special Tony Award in 1957 and again in 2008 &quot;in recognition of his historic contribution to American musical theatre in the field of orchestrations, as represented on Broadway this season by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s South Pacific.&quot; Other honors have included his Oscar for the film &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, a 1962 Emmy award, television&#x27;s Christopher Award in 1960, the City of New York&#x27;s Handel Medallion in 1967, Los Angeles&#x27;s honorary Scroll in 1979, and an honorary doctorate from Franklin and Marshall College in 1965.

Bennett was the first president of the American Society of Music Arrangers and Composers (ASMAC).

<text>The Opera Band is the debut album by Amici Forever released in 2004.

==Making of the album==

The members of Amici Forever met when rehearsing and performing at opera venues around the world. Tenor Geoff Sewell, originally from New Zealand, came up with the idea of an &quot;opera band&quot; mixing traditional opera with contemporary pop. The band features two tenors, two soprano singers and a bass-baritone singer.

Amici Forever signed with Arista Records and started playing high-profile gigs such as the FA Cup final and the English rugby union final. Nick Patrick, who had produced albums by the Gipsy Kings, Tina Turner and Marvin Gaye produced the band&#x27;s first album &quot;The Opera Band&quot;. The album mixes opera classics such as &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; with pop standards such as &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Soldier&quot; from the Band of Brothers soundtrack.

<text>The Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School (), generally known as El Zamorano or Zamorano, is a private, coeducational, boarding school located in the valley of the Yeguare river, Honduras. El Zamorano&#x27;s main focus is agricultural and there are four different programs to choose from in the school. Enrollment stands at more than 1000 students. It is currently registered in Delaware as a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation.

Zamorano is host to students from several countries, including Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and Mexico.

==History==
The school was founded in 1941 by Samuel Zemurray (1877–1961) a Russian born American and president of the United Fruit Company. Mr. Zemurray set out to create a high quality agricultural education centre, devoted to the training of youth from throughout the region. To carry out this dream, he recruited Dr. Wilson Popenoe, a renowned botanist and horticulturist of the time who had extensive experience in the region, and had already organised the Lancetilla Botanical Gardens in Honduras.

Popenoe travelled for several weeks in 1941, exploring the Central American highlands to develop the project. He finally chose an estate of approximately 15 km² in the valley of the Yeguare, some 30 kilometres from the Honduran capital. The name Zamorano is that of the family from the province of Zamora, Spain that originally owned the estate.

Construction of the school began in late 1941. Dr. Popenoe became the Founding Director of the new institution and held that post until 1957.

==Campus==
The university is located on a large campus. The entire property lies on approximately 70 km², including natural forests and two micro basins, large productive areas, many places for recreation and various buildings. There are green areas, paths and lagoons harbouring numerous wild species that have found natural shelter on the Zamorano campus.

Zamorano has many areas/spots that are host to species that are both native to the region and exotic from all over the tropical world. Thanks to its long and distinguished tradition in biological science research, Zamorano currently has one of the largest herbaria in Latin America. The Paul Standley Herbarium hosts close to 300,000 classified specimens from Meso-America that are available to the students. Its collection of pests and beneficial insects is also in the neighbourhood of 200,000 specimens. Many are the result of research done by Zamorano&#x27;s specialists and the contributions of its students.

The campus is home to more than 1000 resident students on the campus eleven months of every year. An area of 200,000 m² is set aside for student dorms. An area of 70,000 m² is used for various aspects.

==Library==
Zamorano has one main library, the Wilson Popenoe Library. This library has a diverse collection of books. It has over 18,000 specialised books, 6,500 technical brochures, access to online databases worldwide, digital documents and a considerable number of magazines.

==Publications==
* La Zeta, the university&#x27;s student-run newspaper was published until few years ago with a weekly edition. Some efforts have been made to bring it back but they have not been successful as to February 2020.
* The Annual Report is the report, published yearly and focused on the activities for that year. It shows a brief the description of the activities that Zamorano has realised in all the year. Annual Report
* The Class Profiles is the university&#x27;s yearbook, published yearly and focused on the senior class for that year. It shows a brief profile of the graduating seniors, their interest, their projects and related experience.
* Ceiba. A peer review publication that started in 1950. Ceiba is open access and publishes articles using the continuous publication model. Available at http://www.lamjol.info/index.php/CEIBA (past issues and submissions) and https://web.archive.org/web/20130902064235/http://revistas.zamorano.edu/index.php/CEIBA (past issues).

==Enterprises==
The enterprises are the university&#x27;s production, processing and marketing units, where the students learn by doing. Working in the enterprises is an integral part for the formation of each student and takes up about half of their time. The enterprises provide the physical resources and the right environment where the student develops skills and knowledge that prepare them for their future careers.
The University Enterprises are living labs where the students face what has been learned in the classroom and confront it with the real world and in doing so improve their learning process.

The University Enterprises are distributed into three main groups: agriculture, animal husbandry and processing plants. There is also a marketing and sales unit in which students are actively involved, interacting with customers and the market. The agriculture group is made up of the agricultural units for horticulture, orchards, forestry and grains and seed.

The animal husbandry group includes livestock units in dairy and beef cattle, swine production and a support unit in agricultural machinery and irrigation. 
The processing plants group consists of plants for processing dairy and meat products, animal feeds, seed production, fruit and horticultural products, post-harvest care of horticultural products and a sawmill. Each business unit is managed by means of an agribusiness plan and agro-budget so that operations are handled as a company with financial and educational goals.

<text>Santacruz or Santa Cruz (Pronunciation: ) is a suburb of Mumbai. The Santacruz railway station on the Mumbai Suburban Railway, the domestic terminal (T1) of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, and one campus of the University of Mumbai, are all located in Santacruz (East).

Santacruz and its neighbouring suburb Khar fall under the H East and H West wards of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. The locality had a population of 675,951 in 1991, over an area of 12.98 square kilometers, giving it a population density of 36,668 persons per square kilometer.

==History==
The term &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; comes from the Portuguese words meaning &quot;Holy Cross&quot;, a reference to a 150-year-old Cross located on Chapel lane within the compound of a home for destitute women run by Mother Teresa&#x27;s Missionaries of Charity trust. That name was also given to a church that existed on a site on the western side of the railway station along the current Swami Vivekanand Road, presently occupied by the Sacred Heart Boys High School and Sacred Heart Church. This original church was destroyed by the Marathas during their conquest of the Salsette Island from Portugal. When the railways began operations in October 1888, the local railway station was named after the Holy Cross, and Santacruz as a locality came into being.

The then British Government set up RAF Santa Cruz, a military airfield, in 1942. It was home to several RAF squadrons during World War II from 1942 to 1947. The Airport covered an area of about and initially had three runways. The airfield was transferred to the Indian Government for civilian use upon Independence, and came to be known as Santa Cruz airport, the city&#x27;s main airport. Construction of a new passenger terminal and apron began in 1950 and was commissioned in 1958. In the 1980s, a new international terminal was built at Sahar, to cater for the increasing number of passenger movements and types of aircraft; the terminal at Santa Cruz was converted to serve domestic flights and was primarily used by Indian Airlines until the 1990s, when Jet Airways and East West Airlines appeared. The original terminal building still exists and has been given a new façade and host of interior upgrades. A second terminal complex has also been built to supplement existing facilities.

==Geography==
Santa Cruz is bordered by Juhu and Vile Parle to the north and Khar and Bandra to the south. It is broadly divided in two areas: Santa Cruz (East) and Santa Cruz (West) by the Mumbai Suburban Railway line. The Milan Subway and Khar Subway connect the two areas, passing under the rail line. Recently Milan flyover has been built which has improved connectivity between Santacruz East and West. The Western express highway passes through Santacruz East. Because of its unique geography and connectivity, Santacruz is one of the prime locations in Mumbai.

MMRDA has built a Skywalk for pedestrians stretching from Podar School Complex (West Santa Cruz) to Western Express Highway (East Santa Cruz).

===Santacruz (East)===
Santa Cruz (East) consists of Maratha Colony, Prabhat Colony, Agripada, Kalina and Vakola. It also consists of land belonging Airport Authority of India, which consists of the Mumbai Airport and Air India Colony (which comes in Kalina).

The main roads passing through Santa Cruz (E) are the Western Express Highway, Nehru Road, Santacruz-Chembur Link Road and the Kalina-Kurla Link Road. The PIN codes of this area are 400055, 400029 and 400098.

====Dawri Nagar====
Located near Western Express Highway is the site of Sai Baba Temple which is at the centre of the area where many devotees come to pray daily. Baba Mandir is made of marble and seashells. On The Festival of Ramnavmi Utsav more than 10–20,000 people have visited on this day since 1992. The temple has been located at Achanak Krida Mandel / Siddhi Sai Seva Mandal.

====Vakola====
Vakola stretches from the Western Express Highway to the Kalina Military Camp in the east. One of the interesting facts is that the oldest Sindhi colony Aaram Society was inaugurated by India&#x27;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1954 for the refugees who had escaped from Pakistan at 1947 still exists. Yashwant nagar, Dawri Nagar, Nagdevi Nagar, Vakola Bridge, Dhobighat, Shivaji Nagar, Datta Mandir, Vakola Pipeline, Vakola Village, Ramabai wadi, kadam wadi and Vakola Masjid areas form most of Vakola, densely populated by Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Catholics. These communities, though tending to cluster together, live in relative harmony with each other.

Vakola village is home to one of the indigenous communities of Mumbai, the East Indians. Formerly known as Vankola for three centuries, the village formed part of the Kalina Parish which was founded in 1606. It was in 1914 that through the initiative of Fr. C. A. Abreo at Kalina Church, that a chapel was contemplated to be built at Vankola. Mr. John &#x27;Jamboo&#x27; Rodrigues donated the land, and the chapel was finally completed and dedicated to St. Anthony and blessed on 1 January 1921. Practically all the villagers then had relatives (brothers, sisters, in-laws) either at Kalliana (now Kalina) or at Vile Parle. The Church was remodeled in 1977 to suit the changed liturgical norms. Today, St. Anthony&#x27;s Church is one of the largest parishes in the Archdiocese of Mumbai in terms of the Catholic population, which is estimated to include around 23,000 persons.

To the south of the Vankola village were a few fields and marshy lands reaching right up to the Mithi River at Bandra East that contained a lot of wildlife, birds of all kinds and small animals. Vankola village being on a small rise, the land sloped downwards towards the marshes. All social activity of the people was centered at Kalina Village which was connected to Vakola by a small road skirting the Rye Hills which now houses the Military Camp. This small road is still in use and is used a short cut to Kalina.

Anand Nagar is a large development built as transit accommodation for Post-Partition refugees, but subsequently leased out and sold to various families.

Vakola has two schools run by the Catholic Church, St Anthony&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School and St. Charles Girls&#x27; School. Other educational institutions include The Patuck School and College Complex – founded under the Patuck Polytechnic Trust by the Late Mr. Rustomji Hormusji Patuck, a Parsi businessman turned technical educationist, The New Model English High School, The Municipal School at Vakola Bridge that includes several upper and lower primary schools in Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, Telugu mediums and The Nariyalwadi Municipal school that has upper and primary schools in Hindi, Marathi and Tamil mediums And The Public High School &amp; College.

Vakola hosts the corporate headquarters of Asian Paints Limited and a significant number of large commercial banks, including Canara Bank, State Bank of India, The Shamrao Vithal Co-operative Bank (Head Office in Vakola), CitizenCredit Co-operative Bank, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and NKGSB Co-Operative Bank . The Grand Hyatt hotel is located at Vakola, on the erstwhile premises of the Standard Batteries factory. Vakola is also famous for its marble stretch which exists on the Nehru Road till the Western Express Highway. The Domestic Terminal 1 and International Terminal 2 of Mumbai Airport lie 10 mins and 20 mins away respectively from Vakola. The prominent upscale commercial, business and residential district of Bandra Kurla Complex lies neighboring the Vakola and Kalina region.

The road stretching from the Western Express Highway to the Military Camp is called Nehru Road.
A tributary of the Mithi River, called as the Vakola Nallah flows through Vakola. This river overflowed during the statewide floods of 2005 on 26 July 2005 and caused massive damage to slums and housing societies along its banks. Some buildings were under ten feet of water.

The neighbourhood of Vakola is the setting for the 2011 novel &quot;Last Man in Tower&quot;, by Booker Prize–winning Indian author Aravind Adiga.

====Agripada====
Agripada stretches from the Domestic Airport to Chakki Khan. It is densely populated with many slums. It is also connected to the Western Express Highway directly.
It also has a subway named &quot;Aliyavar Jung Marg&quot; which connects it to &quot;Prabhat Colony&quot;. It has various general stores, chemists and few health clinics for the people living in the locality. One of the place&#x27;s uniqueness is that you can see airplanes taking off and landing very closely. It also has the &quot;Mithi Nadi&quot;, the River that flows from Santacruz to Bandra.

====Kalina====
The East Indian village of Kole-Kalyan, now known as Kalina (from the original name Kalliana), lay on the eastern side of a forested hillock called The Rye, a mile and half southeast of Vile Parle. The words Kole-Kalyan mean the homes of jackals, foxes and wolves which at one time roamed freely in large numbers in this area. The people of the village gathered their firewood, berries and Fruits from the Hill that gave a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and the creeks, marshy lagoons, lowlands and coconut groves of Juhu in the west, the Sion Hill and Fort, Mahim, and the Mithi River flowing to the sea at Bandra in the South, the hillocks of Chakala and Bamanwada, the small hamlet of Sahar and the Marol hills and forests to the North and the village of Kurla and the Western Ghats in the east.

The British saw the importance of this hill and promptly put up a military base with training facilities for soldiers and rest houses for the Officers and fully equipped medical facilities. Today the hill and its military base (called Kalina camp) still stand well maintained, untouched by slums and housing societies, buildings and projects.

The Village was divided into sections like, Bhatt Pakady, Matharpakady, Corderio Wadi, Desachi Pakadi and Ranwar Pakadi, and the other village of Kolovery across the southeast. The Church of Our Lady of Egypt sat beside the large freshwater lake, which was used by the villages for washing clothes. Sweet drinking water was obtained from numerous wells in the villages. The main occupation of the people was agriculture. With British setting up their military base on the hill, many of the local people got employment.

In April 1930, The Kole-Kalyan Death Benefit Fund was inaugurated, presided over by Mr. Avelino Miranda at its first meeting who outlined the aims of the Benefit Fund as to render monetary assistance to the poor and needy of the two villages at the time of Funerals. The Callina Catholic Association established in 1923, won fame and popularity in both cricket and hockey.

The Government acquired the vegetable fields to the north of Kalina village from the villagers in the early 1950s. They paid a pittance as compensation to the villagers at four annas per square yard. It was a forced &#x27;take it or get nothing&#x27; situation. This land is occupied by large apartment complexes belonging to the government-owned airline, i.e., Air-India colony and Indian Airlines colony.

The village of Kalina had doubled and tripled in size by the mushrooming of buildings and slums, huts and shanties illegally built on the east, hugging the Rye Hill and spilling onto the now defunct railway line. The village is practically strangulated and overrun by slums like Jamblipada and Kunchi Kurve Nagar mainly because the ruling politicians failed to maintain the East Indian Villages as heritage properties.

Kalina has undergone high growth in recent years. The area lies midway between two suburban stations of Kurla and Santa Cruz, which are on the Central and Western Railway Lines respectively. It is also close to the Bandra-Kurla complex and only 15 minutes from the domestic terminals of the Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport. Kalina is also an emerging hub for commercial real estate and private companies with big names such as Microsoft, Rolls-Royce (Marine Engines), Mudra Communication setting up shop there. The proposed Mumbai Police Headquarters will be in Kalina. The Directorate Of Forensic Science Laboratories (Govt. of Maha. Mumbai headquarters), The Directorate of Maharashtra Fire Services (Mumbai Headquarters) and the Police Training Quarters are all located in the Kole-Kalyan (Kolivery) village in the Kalina region. The Santa Cruz-Chembur link road will run through Kalina as part of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project.

The Church of Our Lady of Egypt was built in 1606 and the Parish consisted of the following villages under its jurisdiction: – Kole-kalyan, Aldeia, Sur, Sar, Naugar, Vancolem and Cuddy as of 1761 (Humbert I : 223–238). According to Fr. Paulo da Trindade, the church and the parish was founded when Fr. Antonio da Portiuncula was Custos (1606–1609) and Fr. Manoel de S. Mathias, a great missionary baptized more than a thousand souls. The church is one of the very few churches that escaped ruthless destruction and pillage at the hands of the Marathas during the invasion and occupation of 1739, after which secular priests started functioning at the Church of Kalina. In the late 1960s, the Church was enlarged and renovated due to an increase in the Catholic population. On either side of the main altar, large wings were added to accommodate about 200 people. The main structure is still intact, except the Porch that was redesigned and made larger. A new graveyard was added to the north of the church as the old one became insufficient, as the people from Vakola parish have also to be buried here. The church celebrated its 400th centenary in 2006. Its current Parish Priest as of July 2023 is Fr. Rui Comelo.

The Ganesh Temple is the oldest temple in Kalina and provides yeoman service to residents of Kalina. Thousands of devotees make a pilgrimage here, thus making it an important event in the Kalina calendar. The South Indian Temple named &quot;Vigneshwar&quot; is located in Sunder Nagar, a large residential area consisting of row houses. It has become a magnet for tourists from all over Mumbai due to its award-winning design. Kalina also has five mosques.

Kalina is home to a number of schools and colleges besides the Kalina Campus of the University of Mumbai and the prestigious Bombay College of Pharmacy India. The Saint Mary&#x27;s High School and Junior College had its origin as far back as 1876 and was known as The Little Portuguese School when Fr. Custodio Fernandes was the Vicar. The school came into prominence around the year 1912; The number of students increased from 130 to 180 and a temporary structure was built in 1914 to accommodate the growing number. The only problem was that the villagers were not willing to pay any fees and hence the Diocese of Daman and the Bombay Catholic Welfare Organization had to render financial help. By now most well-off families sent their children to school in Bandra, the girls at St. Joseph Convent and the boys at St. Stanislaus and St. Andrews. The children had no transport facilities in those days and would walk the distance daily. In 1936 Archbishop of Bombay took a special interest, and seeing that there was an urgent need for a good building made a substantial gift of Rs. 7000/- and with the efforts of the Vicar and his assistant they managed to get a subscription of Rs. 1100/- from the public. The Foundation stone was laid by Mr. Katrak, the manager of the Kurla Estate. The new building had four large well-ventilated rooms and could accommodate 200 pupils. The strength of the school in 1937 was now 247 pupils, the principal now was Fr. P. Pereira who deserves credit for his able management of the school. Today the school is not only a high school but also a junior college.

Other notable schools in the vicinity are Mary Immaculate High School, a school run by sisters of Ajmer, the Kalina Education Society School, which was set up by the late M.L.A, Mr. Hans Bhugra and Air India Modern School. 
During the statewide floods in 2005, Air India Colony was flooded with water five to six metres deep. In many buildings, the water had entered in the ground floor and first floor level houses and the people had to take shelter on the upper floors. Rescue boats of Navy were requisitioned deployed in the area. Immediately after the deluge, restoration programme was implemented and portable pumps were installed at Air India colony, helping the early discharge of flood water.

A prominent &quot;I Love Kalina&quot; sign proudly marks this location, standing in the busy junction known as Kalina Signal.

====Willingdon Colony====
The Bombay Catholic Cooperative Housing Society constructed in 1930 a low-cost housing estate for the Catholic community, known as Willingdon Colony. It included pre-existing bungalows that the Cooperative had built as early as 1917. The colony was spread over and managed by the Cooperative. The members of the cooperative voted in 1966 to redevelop the colony, with 673 new flats to be built. The redevelopment was planned to provide permanent accommodation for 230 members, with the excess flats to be offered for sale. An additional, separate, building on the land was to provide capacity to temporarily house a further 530 people displaced by slum redevelopments, through the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. A small number of cooperative members opposed the redevelopment, and it was delayed by litigation for nearly 50 years.

Despite heritage preservation concerns, and over the objections of the twenty remaining resident families, their final challenge was dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2014, allowing redevelopment to proceed. Demolition of historic bungalows commenced soon after. Further pauses occurred throughout 2014, as stays for proceedings continued. Despite the court&#x27;s rejection of the challenge to redevelopment, the same group began a new round of legal actions in 2015, with a petition to the High Court, challenging the validity of the permit issued to the developer to transplant 103 trees from the site. The petitioners were not successful in having the tree removal permit withdrawn.

====Saraswat Colony====
The old neighbourhood belonging to the Saraswat Brahmins is one of the most beautiful neighbourhoods in Mumbai with its private gardens, a private playground and pebbled walkways. The colony has more than 15 buildings and now consists of members that belong to various communities. The Bhramakumari Garden is located close to the colony.

<text>Simon James Power (born 5 December 1969) is a New Zealand chief executive and former politician.

Power was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1999 as the Member of Parliament for Rangitīkei. A member of the National Party, he served as Minister of Justice, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and Minister for State Owned Enterprises in the first term of the Fifth National Government from 2008 until 2011. His retirement from politics was considered a surprise.

After leaving Parliament, Power worked for ten years at Westpac, including as acting chief executive. He was chief executive of TVNZ from 2022 to 2023, during the period when it was floated that the state-owned television network merge with Radio New Zealand. Since 2024 he has been chief executive of investment firm Fisher Funds.

==Early years==
Power was educated in Palmerston North, attending St Peter&#x27;s College from 1981-1987. While at St Peter&#x27;s, he captained two senior sports teams and chaired the School Council. He later studied at Victoria University of Wellington, gaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1992 and then a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1993. He served as president of the Victoria University Law Students&#x27; Society for two years.

After leaving university, Power worked as a lawyer for Fitzherbert Rowe in Palmerston North, and for a brief period for Kensington Swan in Auckland. In 1998, he decided to enter national politics. Having been a member of the National Party since the year he left university, he secured the party&#x27;s nomination for Rangitikei, a predominantly rural area just outside Palmerston North. The incumbent, National MP Denis Marshall, retired from Parliament in 1999.

==Member of Parliament==


In the 1999 election, Power won Rangitikei. He defeated his opponent, the Labour Party&#x27;s Craig Walsham, by slightly under three hundred votes. Once in parliament, Power became his party&#x27;s spokesman on Labour, Industrial Relations, and Youth Affairs. After he retained his seat in the 2002 election, these roles were swapped for Justice, Tertiary Education, and Workplace Skills. In 2003, when Don Brash became leader of the National Party, Power&#x27;s responsibilities were once again reshuffled, giving him the portfolios of Defence, Veterans&#x27; Affairs, and Youth Affairs.

In May 2004, Power caused controversy for his statement that (as regards defence and foreign affairs) &quot;where Britain, the United States and Australia go, we go&quot;. Power later expressed regret for how the statement was interpreted, and party leader Don Brash said that it did not reflect National Party policy. In August of the same year, Power was moved from the defence position to that of chief whip.

Between 2005 and 2008, Power was Opposition Spokesperson on Law and Order and repeatedly called for an inquiry into the management of the Corrections Department. A few months before the election in 2008, Parliament&#x27;s Law &amp; Order Select Committee agreed to hold a wide-ranging inquiry. When National won the election in 2008, Power was appointed Minister of Justice. He also served as Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for State Owned Enterprises, and Deputy Leader of the House.

Power was picked as the 2010 politician of the year by the &quot;Trans Tasman&quot; political newsletter.

==Life after Parliament==
On 2 March 2011 Power announced he would step down at the end of the term in late 2011. In April 2011, Power&#x27;s ministerial portfolio for State-Owned Enterprises was transferred to Tony Ryall in preparation for Power&#x27;s transition into business; he wanted to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

In December 2011 Power was granted the right to retain the title of The Honourable in recognition of his term as a Member of the Executive Council of New Zealand and became The Hon. Simon Power. In January 2012 he became the head of the bank Westpac New Zealand&#x27;s Private Bank. In the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours Power was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order (QSO) for services as a Member of Parliament.

Power served as the chairman of the King&#x27;s College Board of Governors, during which time he had to deal with accusations of bullying at the school due to the scandal regarding National Party MP Sam Uffindell&#x27;s time at the school.

In 2019 Power completed a master&#x27;s degree in political science at Victoria University of Wellington, with a thesis comparing two US elections.

In late December 2021, Power was appointed as the chief executive of the public broadcaster TVNZ. Power had recently stepped down as acting chief of Westpac Bank when the bank appointed Catherine McGrath as chief executive in November 2021. Power began the role in March 2022. 

On 4th April 2023 Power announced his resignation from TVNZ with his last day being the 30th June.

Power told an interviewer in July 2023 that part of the reason he had left TVNZ was to commence research for his PhD in American politics. Power said that he planned to holiday in &quot;...California, Washington DC and New York...&quot; then undertake archival research &quot;...focusing on four U.S. Presidents and their paths as governors or through the Senate.&quot; He returned to the financial industry in February 2024 as chief executive of Fisher Funds.

<text>The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, officially referred to as the Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge, is a pair of long beam bridges with a central tall cable-stayed bridge. It spans Lower Tampa Bay to connect Pinellas County (St. Petersburg, Florida) to Manatee County (Terra Ceia, Florida). The current Sunshine Skyway opened in 1987 and is the second bridge of that name on the site. It was designed by the Figg &amp; Muller Engineering Group and built by the American Bridge Company. The bridge is considered the flagship bridge of Florida and serves as a gateway to Tampa Bay. The four-lane bridge carries Interstate 275 and U.S. Route 19, passing through Pinellas County, Hillsborough County and Manatee County. It is a toll bridge, with a toll assessed on two-axle vehicles traveling in either direction at a rate of $1.75 cash or $1.16 with the state&#x27;s SunPass system. 

The original Sunshine Skyway was a two-lane beam bridge with a central truss bridge built directly to the west of the current structure. It was completed in 1954, and a second two-lane span opened in 1971. The original bridge was the site of two major maritime disasters in 1980, the second of which resulted in its partial destruction. The first incident was on the night of January 28, when the United States Coast Guard cutter collided with the tanker &quot;Capricorn&quot; in the western approach to the bridge, resulting in the sinking of the cutter with the loss of 23 crew members in the worst peacetime disaster in the history of the U.S. Coast Guard. The second incident came on the morning of May 9, 1980, when the freighter MV &quot;Summit Venture&quot; collided with a support pier near the center of the bridge during a sudden squall, resulting in the catastrophic failure of the southbound roadway and the deaths of 35 people when several vehicles, including a Greyhound bus, plunged into Tampa Bay. Traffic was diverted onto the surviving two-lane span for several years until the replacement Skyway Bridge was completed, at which time the old bridge was partially demolished and converted into two long fishing piers.

The channel beneath the main span of the Skyway allows access to Port Tampa Bay, Port Tampa, the Port of St. Petersburg, and SeaPort Manatee, making it one of the busiest shipping lanes in the United States. Owing to the 1980 disaster, the current bridge incorporates numerous safety features to protect the structure from ship collisions.

==History==
=== Precursors and proposals ===
In 1924, J.G. &quot;Jim&quot; Foley, a realtor, and his partner Charles R. Carter joined with James E. Bussey, an attorney, to create the Bee Line Ferry Company. The service started on March 7, 1927, and originally had two ferries: &quot;Fred D. Doty&quot; and the &quot;City of Wilmington&quot; (which was later renamed &quot;Pinellas&quot;). The ferry crossed from the end of Bay Vista Park in St. Petersburg and went to Piney Point on the other side of the bay.

A physiotherapist from St. Petersburg named Herman Simmonds proposed building a &quot;high-level suspension bridge&quot; in 1926. Sometime during 1927, Simmonds received congressional approval and a permit from the US War Department to build a bridge, but efforts were put on hold due to the Great Depression.

In 1929, the Florida Legislature gave the Bee Line Ferry a 50-year franchise to operate a service between Pinellas and Manatee Counties. The service gradually expanded during the 1930s, and by the end of the decade, Bee Line operated four boats which departed every 30 minutes in the winter and every 45 minutes in the summer during daylight hours, weather permitting. During its last full year of operation in 1941, Bee Line carried almost 100,000 vehicles and thousands of passengers. However, ferries stopped running in 1942 when many employees were called to serve and the boats were converted to military use as part of the World War II war effort. In 1944, the St. Petersburg Port Authority bought the franchise from Bee Lee and resumed ferry service, albeit on a smaller scale until the end of the war. Regular ferry service would continue until the Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened a decade later.

During the same period, there were several preliminary proposals to build a tunnel or a series of bridges across the mouth of Tampa Bay. In 1929, a bill was introduced in the Florida legislature to build a tunnel crossing lower Tampa Bay running from Pinellas Point to Piney Point, with the tunnel itself being buried under the bay and going for a length of . This proposal did not get past the early planning stages, as construction costs would be high, and unspecified &quot;Tampa officials&quot; argued that construction of any bridge or tunnel would present a navigational hazard. 

Another proposal soon originated from Louis E. Saupe, head of the West Coast Bridge and Tunnel Company. This consisted of a series of short causeways running from Maximo Point to Mullet Key on the Pinellas Country side, a tunnel running for less than beneath the shipping lane near the mouth of the bay, and another causeway running to Terra Ceia on the Manatee County side. State officials preliminarily approved the project in 1939 and the state legislature agreed to fund it. However, the project designed crossed through a portion of Hillsborough County near the mouth of Tampa Bay. Since the county was not mentioned in legislation, the bill was declared unconstitutional and the project stalled.

Bail, Horton, and Associates, along with Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hogan &amp; Macdonald received a contract from the port authority on December 20, 1944, to design the bridge. Both firms released a report in November 1945 about the bridge. Freeman Horton of Bail, Horton and Associates proposed Snead Island as its southern terminus and 10th Street in Palmetto as the thoroughfare. Bail, Horton, and Associates was awarded the contract but as it was unable to get $10 million in revenue bonds, the state government halted the project sometime during the late 1940s. The design competition was reactivated again in the early 1950s with Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hogan &amp; Macdonald getting the contract this time and they ended up serving as the engineers for construction and design. The partner-in-charge for Brinckerhoff was M. N. Quade. The successful attempt for building the bridge came after the Florida State Improvement Commission was approached with a proposal that they finance it while the State Road Department (SRD) built it. The Florida&#x27;s State Improvement Commission proceeded to at some point take over the St. Petersburg Port Authority&#x27;s assets which included $520,000 seen with bonded indebtedness. A $21,250,000 bond issue was passed by the Improvement Commission and sales started after the Port Authority&#x27;s assets were acquired.

====Naming the bridge====
On July 4, 1950, a day-long &quot;Spans Across the Bay&quot; festival was held in St. Petersburg to celebrate the approval of the long-awaited bridge and to announce its name. The St. Pete Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Florida State Road Department had conducted a nationwide contest to name the structure, with the rules dictating that it should not be named after a specific person or geographic place. Over 20,000 entries were submitted, and at the celebration on the Fourth of July, Virginia Seymore of nearby Indian Rocks Beach was announced as the winner for her submission of &quot;Sunshine Skyway&quot;.

=== Construction of original bridge ===
Construction bids began to be accepted in July 1950 and construction started on October 19, 1950 with 544 workers. It was built by the Virginia Bridge Company and another firm that was involved doing engineering work was Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and McDonald. Staging areas for the construction of the bridge were established at both crossing sites. An entire concrete factory was established near Piney Point while prefabricated concrete parts were delivered via barge from a site in Tampa where they were made. of material was dredged as part of building the causeways for the bridge. To physically build the bridge, of structural steel, of rebar and of concrete were used.

=== Original bridge ===

The original two-lane bridge opened to traffic on September 6, 1954. At the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening it was among the longest bridges on Earth and it was the longest continuous bridge in the United States. Notable participants in opening ceremonies that day were: US senator and former governor Spessard Holland, former governors Charley E. Johns and Fuller Warren along with James Melton and General James Van Fleet. Delegations from ten Florida counties participated that day. On the day the original bridge opened, it was toll free from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. A reported 15,086 cars crossed the bridge starting at 11:40 a.m. when opening ceremonies ended and 11 p.m. when the toll-free time ended.

The bridge&#x27;s central span was long with a opening for a ship channel. It consisted of 32 concrete piers set every with the exception of the ship channel and the bridge went upwards at a 5% grade. Two lanes were used for it with no passing allowed. The original maximum speed limit was and the minimum was . The lack of illumination made the bridge dark at night. The bridge was not easily accessible, however, and drivers often had to take detours to reach it. U.S. Route 19&#x27;s final segment, which ended at the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, opened on July 19, 1955.

=== Second span ===
In 1969, a second two-lane span was built beside the original to ease traffic and bring the bridge up to Interstate Highway standards. Opening of the newer span was delayed until 1971 for reinforcing of the south main pier, which had cracked due to insufficient supporting pile depth. It was dedicated on May 19, 1971. Both Governor Reubin Askew and the mayor of Bradenton, B.T. Arbuckle, attended the second span&#x27;s dedication. The second span was used for all southbound traffic, while the original span was converted to carry only northbound traffic.

=== 1980 collapse ===
The southbound span (opened in 1971) of the original bridge was destroyed on the morning of May 9, 1980, when the freighter MV &quot;Summit Venture&quot; collided with a support column during a sudden squall, causing the catastrophic failure of over of the span.

Several vehicles were at the top of the bridge when almost a quarter-mile of roadway fell away beneath them while others drove off the edge, either because the drivers did not notice the collapse in the driving rain or could not stop quickly enough in the wet conditions. In all, six cars, a truck, and a Greyhound bus plummeted into Tampa Bay, resulting in 35 deaths. A few drivers, including former Major League Baseball player Granny Hamner, were able to stop their vehicles before reaching the gap, and as seen in many photographs of the aftermath, a Buick Skylark driven by local car dealer Richard Hornbuckle skidded to a halt just two feet from the chasm.

In the water below, several small official and private boats and a transportation department diving team arrived soon after the intense but narrow squall line cleared the vicinity. However, the frantic rescue effort became a recovery operation, as only victims&#x27; bodies were found. The only survivor of the fall was Wesley MacIntire, whose Ford Courier pickup truck had bounced off the hull of the &quot;Summit Venture&quot; and into the water. The truck sank to the shallow bottom of the bay, but MacIntire managed to escape and swim to the surface, where he was quickly pulled to safety aboard the freighter. He sued the company that owned the ship and won a $175,000 settlement in 1984 ($ today).

John Lerro, the veteran harbor pilot who was steering the ship at the time of the accident, was cleared of wrongdoing by both a state grand jury and a Coast Guard investigation. The investigations concluded that the inbound freighter had been in the process of maneuvering into the narrow channel under the center of the bridge when a microburst containing sudden torrential rains and winds cut visibility to near zero and temporarily rendered the ship&#x27;s radar useless. Lerro put the ship&#x27;s engines into full reverse and ordered the emergency dropping of the anchor when he realized that the freighter had left the channel, but the forward momentum of the 20,000-ton ship along with strong winds from astern pushed the bow into support beams to the right of the shipping lane. While the main support pier nearest to the channel withstood the strike with only minor damage, a secondary support pier just to the south was not designed to withstand such an impact and failed catastrophically, causing the entire center of the southbound span to collapse at 7:38 a.m.

=== Replacement bridge ===

Soon after the disaster, the undamaged northbound span was converted back to a two-lane, two-way bridge while the state of Florida considered proposals for a replacement. Ideas included the construction of a tunnel (which was deemed impractical due to Florida&#x27;s high water table) and a simple reconstruction of the broken section of the old bridge, which would not widen the narrow shipping lane. Governor Bob Graham&#x27;s idea to build a &quot;signature&quot; cable-stayed bridge with a span that would be 50% wider than that of the old Skyway Bridge won out over other proposals. In addition to a wider shipping lane, the channel would be marked by a -long series of large concrete barriers, and the support piers would be protected by massive concrete &quot;dolphins&quot;.

Construction began in January 1983 with the pounding of pilings for the foundation, and work on the main piers began the following September. The complicated project was delayed several times by bad weather and various difficulties in construction, and the planned opening was pushed back several times. Finally, the opening ceremony was set for April 30, 1987. However, on April 29 at about 3:30 p.m., the new bridge&#x27;s protective bumpers were hit head-on by the &quot;Deliverance&quot;, a shrimp boat. The bumper sustained minor damage and the bridge was not affected, but the vessel took on water and was towed out of the channel into shallow waters, where it promptly sank. The opening ceremonies proceeded as scheduled.

=== Demolition of former bridge ===
In 1990, the FDOT awarded a bid to Hardaway Company (owner of Controlled Demolition, Inc.) to demolish all steel and concrete sections of the older Sunshine Skyway spans. The scope of the project required that all underwater piles and piers, and surface roadway, girders, and beams, be dismantled. Special care had to be taken in removing underwater bridge elements near the channel, and the central portion of the original bridge had to be removed in one piece to minimize closure of the only approach to the busy Port of Tampa. Most of the concrete material was used to create an artificial reef near the southbound approach of the old bridge, which was converted into a long pier for newly created Skyway Fishing Pier State Park. Unused approaches to the original spans were demolished in 2008.

Wesley MacIntire, the only motorist survivor of the collapse, was the last person to drive over the intact original span before it was demolished. Accompanied by his wife, he stopped at the apex of the bridge and dropped 35 white carnations into the water, one for each person who died in the disaster.

==Issues and concerns==
=== Suicides ===
At least 316 people have died by suicide by jumping from the bridge or its predecessors into the waters of Tampa Bay. An estimated 48 others have survived. Many other missing persons are suspected of having jumped from the bridge, but their deaths could not be confirmed, as no bodies were recovered.

In response to the high number of suicide attempts from the bridge, Florida installed six crisis hotline phones along the center span in 1999, and began 24-hour patrols. , the call center at the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay received 18 calls from potential jumpers, all of whom survived, according to a 2003 &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; report. However, the bridge saw an average of one jump per month, reaching a record high of 18 suicides in 2018.

In 2006, a feature film, &quot;Loren Cass&quot;, was released, which depicted a suicide jump off the Sunshine Skyway. Two years later, Sean Michael Davis of Rhino Productions was inspired by his haunting experience witnessing a woman get out of her car and immediately jump off the bridge before anyone could intervene to create a not-for-profit film titled &quot;Skyway Down&quot;. His objectives were to deter other potential jumpers by &quot;&#x27;punch[ing] them in the face&#x27; with interviews with survivors and family members&quot;, to give them &quot;hope and to try to de-glorify the romanticism of the bridge&quot;, in part by informing those who have &quot;mulled a leap to know about the bloody, battered aftermath.&quot;

In 2020, the FDOT installed the Skyway Vertical Net, a vertical fence designed to deter suicide attempts. The fencing was placed atop the bridge&#x27;s waist-high concrete barriers, creating an overall &quot;wall&quot; almost tall which runs for about along the highest portions of the bridge. The fence is designed to dissuade potential jumpers or at least slow them down long enough that law enforcement officials can reach them. The number of jumpers has been drastically reduced since the project&#x27;s completion in June 2021, with only five reported over the ensuing 29 months.

As on any Florida controlled-access highway, pedestrians and bicycles are prohibited. Stopping on the bridge for any nonemergency, including sightseeing, is prohibited. Traffic on the bridge is monitored by the Florida Highway Patrol, and a bicyclist, pedestrian, or stopped vehicle results in a police dispatch.

===Corrosion===
A major problem with the Sunshine Skyway Bridge is corrosion of the steel in the precast concrete segmental columns on the high-level approaches. Because the segments are hollow, workers were able to enter the bridge superstructure in 2003 and 2004 to reinforce the corroded sections of the bridge, ensuring its future safety. Another problem arose around 2005–06 when several news bureaus reported paint discolorations on the bridge&#x27;s cables. These paint splotches and patches were a result of touch-ups that were performed sometime in 1998, but began to show through as a result of using newer, environmentally safe paint. The change in the paint&#x27;s composition caused it to fade faster than expected.

From 2006 to 2008, FDOT hired a contractor to perform the first full repainting of the bridge since it opened in 1987. The work included repainting the bridge&#x27;s 42 steel cables one consistent shade of yellow and rehabilitating the lighting system at the summit of the bridge. In 2022–2023, the yellow steel cables were repainted and corrosion protection was added to the ship impact system on each side of the channel.

===Low clearance===
A 2014 FDOT study noted that the Skyway&#x27;s low bridge clearance prevented larger vessels from using the Port Tampa Bay terminals, but made no recommendation about options, as the air draft of most new cruise ships exceeds the bridge&#x27;s height limit at . As long ago as 2000, cruise ship manufacturers have had to make special modifications for ships destined for Tampa, and newer classes of cruise ships such as the Oasis class, which has a height of , far exceed the bridge clearance.

==Traffic==
===Usage and tourism===
The former and current bridges have been featured in various forms of media. The original Sunshine Skyway Bridge is featured in &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and the opening credits to &quot;Superboy&quot;. The current bridge has provided the setting for several films such as &quot;Loren Cass&quot; and &quot;The Punisher&quot;. The bridge also served as plot devices to various novels such as Dennis Lehane&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Sacred&quot; and Ben Bova&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Powersat&quot;. The bridge is also the subject of the song &quot;Skyway Avenue&quot; by We the Kings. The current bridge is also a popular filming location for car commercials.

The United States Postal Service featured the bridge in 2012 on a Priority Mail postage stamp. Carl T. Hermann worked on the painting and the digital illustration was created by artist Dan Cosgrove.

In 2005, an act of the Florida Legislature officially named the current bridge the Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge, after the former governor of Florida and then-U.S. Senator who presided over its design and most of its construction. He reportedly was inspired to suggest the current design by a visit to France, where he saw a similar cable-stayed bridge, the Brotonne Bridge. The original bridge was dedicated to state engineer William E. Dean, as noted on a plaque displayed at the rest area at the south end of the bridge.

In November 2017, work began on installing decorative lighting to the skyway&#x27;s columns, main spans, and sloped spans. The $15.6 million lighting project provides a visual aesthetic while also enhancing safety and security by providing more light to the underside of the bridge from dusk to dawn. Over 1,800 light-emitting diodes were installed along of the bridge, which cycle through animated routines. The lighting project was completed in October 2019 and funded by FDOT through collected toll fees.

===Skyway 10K===
On January 11, 1987, the Skyway Bridge opened up to 10,000 runners, joggers, and walkers before the bridge was opened to motor-vehicle traffic the following week. Runners participated in four races that ran simultaneously across the bridge, with two races going southbound and two races directed northbound. Publicity and posters for the race referred to it by the humorous title &quot;20,000 Feet Above the Sea&quot;, a reference to the 1870 Jules Verne novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;.

On March 4, 2018, in partnership with the Armed Forces Families Foundation, the Skyway Bridge was closed for the Inaugural Skyway 10K. In contrast to the one-time race in 1987, the Skyway 10K has been held annually since 2018, with the exception of 2021, as it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was to be held virtually instead.

<text>The Heterogeneous Element Processor (HEP) was introduced by Denelcor, Inc. in 1982. The HEP&#x27;s architect was Burton Smith. The machine was designed to solve fluid dynamics problems for the Ballistic Research Laboratory. A HEP system, as the name implies, was pieced together from many heterogeneous components -- processors, data memory modules, and I/O modules. The components were connected via a switched network.

A single processor, called a PEM (Process Execution Module), in a HEP system (up to sixteen PEMs could be connected) was rather unconventional; via a &quot;program status word (PSW) queue&quot; up to fifty processes could be maintained in hardware at once. The largest system ever delivered had 4 PEMs. The eight-stage instruction pipeline allowed instructions from eight different processes to proceed at once. In fact, only one instruction from a given process was allowed to be present in the pipeline at any point in time. Therefore, the full processor throughput of 10 MIPS could only be achieved when eight or more processes were active; no single process could achieve throughput greater than 1.25 MIPS. This type of multithreading processing classifies today the HEP as a barrel processor, while it was described as an &quot;MIMD pipelined processor&quot; by its designers. The hardware implementation of the HEP PEM was emitter-coupled logic.

Processes were classified as either user-level or supervisor-level. User-level processes could create supervisor-level processes, which were used to manage user-level processes and perform I/O. Processes of the same class were required to be grouped into one of seven user tasks and seven supervisor tasks.

Each processor, in addition to the PSW queue and instruction pipeline, contained instruction memory, 2,048 64-bit general purpose registers and 4,096 constant registers. Constant registers were differentiated by the fact that only supervisor processes could modify their contents. The processors themselves contained no data memory; instead, data memory modules could be separately attached to the switched network.

The HEP memory consisted of completely separate instruction memory (up to 128 MBs) and data memory (up to 1 GB). Users saw 64-bit words, but in reality, data memory words were 72-bit with the extra bits used for state, see next paragraph, parity, tagging, and other uses.

The HEP implemented a type of mutual exclusion in which all registers and locations in data memory had associated &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;full&quot; states. Reading from a location set the state to &quot;empty,&quot; while writing to it set the state to &quot;full.&quot; A programmer could allow processes to halt after trying to read from an empty location or write to a full location, enforcing critical sections.

The switched network between elements resembled, in many ways, a modern computer network. On the network were sets of nodes, each of which had three links. When a packet arrived at a node, it consulted a routing table and attempted to forward the packet closer to its destination. If a node became congested, any incoming packets were passed on without routing. Packets treated in such a manner had their priority level increased; when several packets vied for a single node, a packet with a higher priority level would be routed before ones with lower priority levels.

Another component of the switched network was the sO System, with its own memory and many individual DEC UNIBUS buses attached for disks and other peripherals. The system also had the ability to save the full/empty bits not normally visible directly. The initial IO System performance was shown to be woefully inadequate due to the high latency in starting the IO operations. Ron Natalie (from BRL) and Burton Smith designed a new system out of spare parts on napkins at a local steakhouse and put it into operation in the course of the ensuing week.

The HEP&#x27;s primary application programming language was a unique Fortran variant. In time C, Pascal, and SISAL were added. The syntax of data variables using full-empty bits prepended &#x27;$&#x27; before their name. So &#x27;A&#x27; would name a local variable, but $A would be a locking full-empty variable. Application dead-lock was thus possible. Problematic, failure to &#x27;$&#x27; could introduce unintended numerical inaccuracy.

The first HEP operating system was HEPOS. Mike Muuss was involved in a Unix port for the Ballistic Research Laboratory. HEPOS was not a Unix-like operating system.

Although it was known to have poor cost-performance, the HEP received attention due to what were, at the time, several revolutionary features. The HEP had the performance of a CDC 7600-class computer in the Cray-1 era. HEP systems were leased by the Ballistic Research Laboratory (four PEM system), Los Alamos, the Argonne National Laboratory (single PEM), the National Security Agency and (Japan, 1 PEM). Germany&#x27;s Messerschmitt (three PEMS system) is the only client who bought it. Denelcor also delivered a two PEM system to the University of Georgia in exchange for them providing software assistance (the system had also been offered to the University of Maryland). Messerschmitt was the only client to put the HEP into use for &quot;real&quot; applications; the other clients used it for experimenting with parallel algorithms. The BRL system was used to prepare a movie using the BRL-CAD software as its only real application.
Faster and larger designs for HEP-2 and HEP-3 were started but never completed. The architectural concept would later be embodied with the code-name Horizon.

<text>The Satellite Data System (SDS) is a system of United States military communications satellites. At least three generations have been used: SDS-1 from 1976 to 1987; SDS-2 from 1989 to 1996; SDS-3 from 1998 to the present. It is believed that these satellites were known by the code name &quot;Quasar&quot;. The first generation was named simply &#x27;SDS&#x27;, the second generation was named &#x27;Quasar&#x27; and the third generation each had their own designations.

== Orbital characteristics ==
SDS satellites have a highly elliptical orbit, going from about 300 kilometers at perigee to roughly 39,000 km at apogee in order to allow communications with polar stations that cannot contact geosynchronous satellites. The high apogee meant that the polar regions were visible for long amounts of time, and only two satellites were required in order to achieve constant communications ability. In addition, two geostationary satellites appear to be part of the system. The SDS satellites were constructed by Hughes Aircraft Company.

== Mission ==
The primary purpose of the SDS satellites is to relay imagery from low-flying reconnaissance satellites, notably the Keyhole optical reconnaissance and Lacrosse/Onyx radar reconnaissance satellites to ground stations in the United States.

== SDS-1 ==

Each SDS-1 satellite had 12 channels available for Ultra high frequency (UHF) communication. They were cylindrical in shape, roughly long. 980 watts of electrical power were available from solar panels and batteries. The SDS-1 had a mass of and was launched on Titan-3B rockets. The SDS-1 satellites had similar orbits to the Air Force&#x27;s Jumpseat ELINT satellites.

It has been speculated that the early satellites served as data relays for the first KH-11 Kennen reconnaissance satellites.

== SDS-2 ==
The SDS-2 is significantly more massive at , with three separate communication dishes, including one for a K-band downlink. Two dishes are in diameter, while the third is in diameter. The solar arrays generate 1238 watts of power. It is believed that the Space Shuttle has been used to launch several satellites, possibly on missions STS-28, STS-38, and STS-53. Other launches have used the Titan IV launch vehicle.
