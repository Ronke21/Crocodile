<text>The Chiroteuthidae are a family of deep-sea squid, generally small to medium in size, rather soft and gelatinous, and slow moving. They are found in most temperate and tropical oceans, but are known primarily from the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Indo-Pacific. The family is represented by approximately 12 species and four subspecies in four genera, two of which are monotypic. They are sometimes known collectively as whip-lash squid, but this common name is also applied to the Mastigoteuthidae, which are sometimes treated as a subfamily (Mastigoteuthinae) of Chiroteuthidae.

The monotypic genus &quot;Grimalditeuthis&quot; was once (and may still be) given its own family, Grimalditeuthidae. Generally speaking, chiroteuthids are not well represented by described specimens, because they are so often damaged during capture.

== Description ==

The Chiroteuthidae are most notable for their unique paralarval stage, known as the doratopsis stage. Although morphology varies greatly within the family, the Chiroteuthidae are distinguished by their extremely elongated bodies and (in most species) tentacles; the latter may be up to four times the mantle length in &quot;Asperoteuthis acanthoderma&quot;. The head is atop an elongated neck and the brachial pillar is well-developed, the eyes are large; in some &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot; and all &quot;Chiroteuthis&quot; species, the fourth pair of arms possess both greater girth and length than the other arms. The fragile, gelatinous body is conical and the neck cylindrical; the fins range from oval to elliptical, about 50% of the mantle length. The suckers of the arms occur in two series, and those of the clubs in four (but are absent in subadult &quot;Grimalditeuthis&quot; and absent proximally in &quot;Asperoteuthis&quot;). The club is elongated and—with the exception of &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot; species—is subdivided by symmetrical, protective membranes into two or three parts.

The funnel locking apparatus is oval; its cartilage is ear-shaped with one or two projections and a central depression. In &quot;Grilmalditeuthis&quot;, the apparatus is fused (but nuchal articulation is free); in &quot;Chiroteuthis&quot; both the tragus and antitragus are present, while in &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot;, only the antitragus is present. Also absent in &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot; are the funnel valve, tentacle pads, and distal suckers on the fourth arms.

Some species (excluding &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot;) are bioluminescent, with photophores (light-producing organs) variably present on the inner surface of the ventral arms, on the ventral surface of the eyes (one to three patches or bands), on the ink sac, and near the club terminus. A number of chambers containing ammonium chloride are contained within the arms, head, and mantle. With a lower density than the surrounding seawater, the ammonium chloride helps chiroteuthids to conserve energy reserved for swimming by maintaining the body&#x27;s neutral buoyancy. The eyelid sinus is indistinct, occipital folds are absent, and long stalks support the olfactory papillae. The largest species reach a mantle length of about 78 cm. Body coloration is typically beige to sepia, but &quot;Asperoteuthis acanthoderma&quot; is noted for its deep violet color.

== Life history ==

Little is known of chiroteuthid reproduction. The distinctive doratopsis paralarvae are thought to remain within the first few hundred meters of the water column, where they likely feed on zooplankton and slowly undergo a marked transformation to subadults. During the doratopsis stage, the paralarval chiroteuthid possesses a greatly elongated gladius (internal shell) extending well beyond the fins; this supports a long, trailing, tail-like structure that is further adorned with—depending on the species—either a pair of large oval or heart-shaped &quot;secondary fins&quot;, a series of small flaps running the length of the tail, or a series of oval &quot;bulbs&quot; made buoyant by low-density fluids. Some species&#x27; paralarvae also have eyes projecting ventrally. The elongated neck and brachial pillar are chambered, and vesicular tissue is present in the posterior end of the mantle and (in advanced stages) in the arms.

Although lost during maturation in most species, some adults (e.g., &quot;Grimalditeuthis&quot;) retain their tails. During the paralarva&#x27;s transformation into a subadult, its arms also become elongated (but remain subequal in some species) along with other changes in body proportions; photophores are developed, and the paralarval club is resorbed and replaced with an adult form. &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot; species retain their paralarval clubs; together with a lack of photophores, this feature causes some authors to suggest &quot;Planctoteuthis&quot; species are actually mature doratopsids, arising from neoteny. The time frame of the doratopsis stage, including the onset or loss of specific features, is unknown.

<text>A Due Process Clause is found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which prohibit the deprivation of &quot;life, liberty, or property&quot; by the federal and state governments, respectively, without due process of law.

The U.S. Supreme Court interprets these clauses to guarantee a variety of protections: procedural due process (in civil and criminal proceedings); substantive due process (a guarantee of some fundamental rights); a prohibition against vague laws; incorporation of the Bill of Rights to state governments; and equal protection under the laws of the federal government.

==Text==
The clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:
The clause in Section One of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:
==Background==

Clause 39 of Magna Carta provided:

The phrase &quot;due process of law&quot; first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of Edward III of England, as follows:
==Drafting==
New York was the only state that asked Congress to add &quot;due process&quot; language to the U.S. Constitution. New York ratified the U.S. Constitution and proposed the following amendment in 1788: 

In response to this proposal from New York, James Madison drafted a due process clause for Congress. Madison cut out some language and inserted the word &quot;without&quot;, which had not been proposed by New York. Congress then adopted the exact wording that Madison proposed after Madison explained that the due process clause would not be sufficient to protect various other rights:
==Interpretation==

===Scope===
The Supreme Court has interpreted the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment identically, as Justice Felix Frankfurter once explained in a concurring opinion:

In 1855, the Supreme Court explained that, to ascertain whether a process is due process, the first step is to &quot;examine the constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions&quot;. In the same 1855 case, the Supreme Court said, 

In the 1884 case of &quot;Hurtado v. California&quot;, the Court said:

Due process also applies to the creation of taxing districts, as taxation is a deprivation of property. Due process typically requires public hearings prior to the creation of a taxing district.

=== &quot;State&quot; ===
Due process applies to U.S. territories, although they are not States.

=== &quot;Person&quot; ===
The Due Process Clauses apply to both natural persons, including citizens and non-citizens, as well as to &quot;legal persons&quot; (that is, corporate personhood). The Fifth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause was first applied to corporations in 1893 by the Supreme Court in &quot;Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co.&quot; &quot;Noble&quot; was preceded by &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; in 1886. The Due Process Clauses apply to non-citizens within the United States – no matter whether their presence may be or is &quot;unlawful, involuntary or transitory&quot; – although the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that non-citizens can be stopped, detained, and denied past immigration officials at points of entry (e.g. at a port or airport) without the protection of the Due Process Clause because, while technically on U.S. soil, they are not considered to have entered the United States.

=== &quot;Life&quot; ===
In &quot;Bucklew v. Precythe&quot;, 587 U.S. 119 (2019), the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause expressly allows the death penalty in the United States because &quot;the Fifth Amendment, added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a &#x27;capital&#x27; crime and &#x27;deprived of life&#x27; as a penalty, so long as proper procedures are followed&quot;.

=== &quot;Liberty&quot; ===

The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the term &quot;liberty&quot; in the Due Process Clauses broadly:

===State actor===

The prohibitions of the due process clauses apply only to the actions of state actors and not against private citizens. However, &quot;[p]rivate persons, jointly engaged with state officials in the prohibited action, are acting &#x27;under color&#x27; of law... To act &#x27;under color&#x27; of law does not require that the accused be an officer of the State. It is enough that he is a willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents&quot;.

===Procedural due process===
Procedural due process requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. When the government seeks to deprive a person of one of those interests, procedural due process requires the government to afford the person, at minimum, notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a decision made by a neutral decisionmaker.

This protection extends to all government proceedings that can result in an individual&#x27;s deprivation, whether civil or criminal in nature, from parole violation hearings to administrative hearings regarding government benefits and entitlements to full-blown criminal trials. The article &quot;Some Kind of Hearing&quot; written by Judge Henry Friendly created a list of basic due process rights &quot;that remains highly influential, as to both content and relative priority&quot;. These rights, which apply equally to civil due process and criminal due process, are:
# An unbiased tribunal.
# Notice of the proposed action and the grounds asserted for it.
# Opportunity to present reasons why the proposed action should not be taken.
# The right to present evidence, including the right to call witnesses.
# The right to know opposing evidence.
# The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses.
# A decision based exclusively on the evidence presented.
# Opportunity to be represented by counsel.
# Requirement that the tribunal prepare a record of the evidence presented.
# Requirement that the tribunal prepare written findings of fact and reasons for its decision.

====Civil procedural due process====
Procedural due process is essentially based on the concept of &quot;fundamental fairness&quot;. For example, in 1934, the United States Supreme Court held that due process is violated &quot;if a practice or rule offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental&quot;. As construed by the courts, it includes an individual&#x27;s right to be adequately notified of charges or proceedings, the opportunity to be heard at these proceedings, and that the person or panel making the final decision over the proceedings be impartial in regards to the matter before them.

To put it more simply, where an individual is facing a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, procedural due process mandates that they are entitled to adequate notice, a hearing, and a neutral judge.

The Supreme Court has formulated a balancing test to determine the rigor with which the requirements of procedural due process should be applied to a particular deprivation, for the obvious reason that mandating such requirements in the most expansive way for even the most minor deprivations would bring the machinery of government to a halt. The Court set out the test as follows: &quot;[I]dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: first, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and, finally, the Government&#x27;s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.&quot;

Procedural due process has also been an important factor in the development of the law of personal jurisdiction, in the sense that it is inherently unfair for the judicial machinery of a state to take away the property of a person who has no connection to it whatsoever. A significant portion of U.S. constitutional law is therefore directed to what kinds of connections to a state are enough for that state&#x27;s assertion of jurisdiction over a nonresident to comport with procedural due process.

The requirement of a neutral judge has introduced a constitutional dimension to the question of whether a judge should recuse themself from a case. Specifically, the Supreme Court has ruled that in certain circumstances, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a judge to recuse themself on account of a potential or actual conflict of interest. For example, in &quot;Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co.&quot; (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia could not participate in a case involving a major donor to his election to that court.

====Criminal procedural due process====
In criminal cases, many of these due process protections overlap with procedural protections provided by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees reliable procedures that protect innocent people from being executed, which would be an obvious example of cruel and unusual punishment.

An example of criminal due process rights is the case &quot;Vitek v. Jones&quot;, 445 U.S. 480 (1980). The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires certain procedural protections for state prisoners who may be transferred involuntarily to a state mental hospital for treatment of a mental disease or defect, such protections including written notice of the transfer, an adversary hearing before an independent decision-maker, written findings, and effective and timely notice of such rights. As established by the district court and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Vitek v. Jones&quot;, these due process rights include:

# Written notice to the prisoner that a transfer to a mental hospital is being considered;
# A hearing, sufficiently after the notice to permit the prisoner to prepare, at which disclosure to the prisoner is made of the evidence being relied upon for the transfer and at which an opportunity to be heard in person and to present documentary evidence is given;
# An opportunity at the hearing to present testimony of witnesses by the defense and to confront and cross-examine witnesses called by the state, except upon a finding, not arbitrarily made, of good cause for not permitting such presentation, confrontation, or cross-examination;
# An independent decision-maker;
# A written statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for transferring the inmate;
# Availability of legal counsel, furnished by the state, if the inmate is financially unable to furnish his own (a majority of Justices rejected this right to state-furnished counsel.); and
# Effective and timely notice of all the foregoing rights.

===Substantive due process===

By the middle of the 19th century, &quot;due process of law&quot; was interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to mean that &quot;it was not left to the legislative power to enact any process which might be devised. The due process article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government, and cannot be so construed as to leave Congress free to make any process &#x27;due process of law&#x27; by its mere will.&quot;

The term &quot;substantive due process&quot; (SDP) is commonly used in two ways: first to identify a particular line of case law, and second to signify a particular attitude toward judicial review under the Due Process Clause. The term &quot;substantive due process&quot; began to take form in 1930s legal casebooks as a categorical distinction of selected due process cases, and by 1950 had been mentioned twice in Supreme Court opinions. SDP involves liberty-based due process challenges which seek certain outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects; in such cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally-based &quot;liberty&quot; which then renders laws seeking to limit said &quot;liberty&quot; either unenforceable or limited in scope. Critics of SDP decisions typically assert that those liberties ought to be left to the more politically accountable branches of government.

Courts have viewed the due process clause, and sometimes other clauses of the Constitution, as embracing those fundamental rights that are &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty&quot;. Just what those rights are is not always clear, nor is the Supreme Court&#x27;s authority to enforce such unenumerated rights clear. Some of those rights have long histories or &quot;are deeply rooted&quot; in American society.

The courts have largely abandoned the Lochner era approach (c. 1897-1937) when substantive due process was used to strike down minimum wage and labor laws in order to protect freedom of contract. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided that numerous other freedoms that do not appear in the plain text of the Constitution are nevertheless protected by the Constitution. If these rights were not protected by the federal courts&#x27; doctrine of substantive due process, they could nevertheless be protected in other ways; for example, it is possible that some of these rights could be protected by other provisions of the state or federal constitutions, and alternatively they could be protected by legislatures.

The Court focuses on three types of rights under substantive due process in the Fourteenth Amendment, which originated in &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot;, , footnote 4. Those three types of rights are:
* the first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights (e.g., the Eighth Amendment);
* restrictions on the political process (e.g., the rights of voting, association, and free speech); and
* the rights of &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;. See U.S. V. Carolene Products Co. (1938).

The Court usually looks first to see if there is a fundamental right, by examining if the right can be found deeply rooted in American history and traditions. Where the right is not a fundamental right, the court applies a rational basis test: if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, then the law is held valid. If the court establishes that the right being violated is a fundamental right, it applies strict scrutiny. This test inquires into whether there is a compelling state interest being furthered by the violation of the right, and whether the law in question is narrowly tailored to address the state interest.

Privacy, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was at issue in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), wherein the Court held that criminal prohibition of contraceptive devices for married couples violated federal, judicially enforceable privacy rights. The right to contraceptives was found in what the Court called the &quot;penumbras&quot;, or shadowy edges, of certain amendments that arguably refer to certain privacy rights. The penumbra-based rationale of &quot;Griswold&quot; has since been discarded; the Supreme Court now uses the Due Process Clause as a basis for various unenumerated privacy rights. Although it has never been the majority view, some have argued that the Ninth Amendment (addressing unenumerated rights) could be used as a source of fundamental judicially enforceable rights, including a general right to privacy, as discussed by Justice Goldberg concurring in &quot;Griswold&quot;.

===Void for vagueness===
The courts have generally determined that laws which are too vague for the average citizen to understand deprive citizens of their rights to due process. If an average person cannot determine who is regulated, what conduct is prohibited, or what punishment may be imposed by a law, courts may find that law to be void for vagueness. See &quot;Coates v. Cincinnati&quot;, where the word &quot;annoying&quot; was deemed to lack due process insertion of fair warning.

===Incorporation of the Bill of Rights===

Incorporation is the legal doctrine by which the Bill of Rights, either in full or in part, is applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause. The basis for incorporation is substantive due process regarding substantive rights enumerated elsewhere in the Constitution, and procedural due process regarding procedural rights enumerated elsewhere in the Constitution.

Incorporation started in 1897 with a takings case, continued with &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot; (1925), which was a First Amendment case, and accelerated in the 1940s and 1950s. Justice Hugo Black famously favored the jot-for-jot incorporation of the entire Bill of Rights. Justice Felix Frankfurter, however—joined later by Justice John M. Harlan—felt that the federal courts should only apply those sections of the Bill of Rights that were &quot;fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty&quot;. It was the latter course that the Warren Court of the 1960s took, although almost all of the Bill of Rights has now been incorporated jot-for-jot against the states. The latest Incorporation is the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment; see Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. ____ (2019).

The role of the incorporation doctrine in applying the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to the states is just as notable as the use of due process to define new fundamental rights that are not explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution&#x27;s text. In both cases, the question has been whether the right asserted is &quot;fundamental&quot;, so that, just as not all proposed &quot;new&quot; constitutional rights are afforded judicial recognition, not all provisions of the Bill of Rights have been deemed sufficiently fundamental to warrant enforcement against the states.

Some people, such as Justice Black, have argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would be a more appropriate textual source for the incorporation doctrine. The Court has not taken that course, and some point to the treatment given to the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the 1873 &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; as a reason why. Although the &quot;Slaughter-House&quot; Court did not expressly preclude application of the Bill of Rights to the states, the clause largely ceased to be invoked in opinions of the Court following the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot;, and when incorporation did begin, it was under the rubric of due process. Scholars who share Justice Black&#x27;s view, such as Akhil Amar, argue that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, like Senator Jacob Howard and Congressman John Bingham, included a Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment for the following reason: &quot;By incorporating the rights of the Fifth Amendment, the privileges or immunities clause would ... have prevented states from depriving &#x27;citizens&#x27; of due process. Bingham, Howard, and company wanted to go even further by extending the benefits of state due process to aliens.&quot;

The Supreme Court has consistently held that Fifth Amendment due process means substantially the same as Fourteenth Amendment due process, and therefore the original meaning of the former is relevant to the incorporation doctrine of the latter. When the Bill of Rights was originally proposed by Congress in 1789 to the states, various substantive and procedural rights were &quot;classed according to their affinity to each other&quot; instead of being submitted to the states &quot;as a single act to be adopted or rejected in the gross&quot;, as James Madison put it. Roger Sherman explained in 1789 that each amendment &quot;may be passed upon distinctly by the States, and any one that is adopted by three fourths of the legislatures may become a part of the Constitution&quot;. Thus, the states were allowed to reject the Sixth Amendment, for example, while ratifying all of the other amendments including the Due Process Clause; in that case, the rights in the Sixth Amendment would not have been incorporated against the federal government. The doctrine of incorporating the content of other amendments into &quot;due process&quot; was thus an innovation, when it began in 1925 with the &quot;Gitlow&quot; case, and this doctrine remains controversial today.

===Reverse incorporation of equal protection===

In &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; , the Supreme Court held that &quot;the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive.&quot; The Court thus interpreted the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause to include an equal protection element. In &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; the Supreme Court added: &quot;Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.&quot;

===Levels of scrutiny===
When a law or other act of government is challenged as a violation of individual liberty under the due process clause, courts nowadays primarily use two forms of scrutiny, or judicial review, which is used by the Judicial Branch. This inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the government&#x27;s method of implementation against the resulting infringement of individual rights. If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review—strict scrutiny—is used. To pass strict scrutiny review, the law or act must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.

When the governmental restriction restricts liberty in a manner that does not implicate a fundamental right, rational basis review is used. Here a legitimate government interest is enough to pass this review. There is also a middle level of scrutiny, called intermediate scrutiny, but it is primarily used in Equal Protection cases rather than in Due Process cases.

===Remedies===
The Court held in 1967 (in &quot;Chapman v. California&quot;) that &quot;we cannot leave to the States the formulation of the authoritative ... remedies designed to protect people from infractions by the States of federally guaranteed rights&quot;.

==Criticism==

===Substantive due process===
Critics of a substantive due process often claim that the doctrine began, at the federal level, with the infamous 1857 slavery case of &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. However, other critics contend that substantive due process was not used by the federal judiciary until after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1869. Advocates of a substantive due process who assert that the doctrine was employed in &quot;Dred Scott&quot; claim that it was employed incorrectly. Additionally, the first appearance of a substantive due process as a concept arguably appeared earlier in the case of &quot;Bloomer v. McQuewan&quot;, , so that Chief Justice Taney would not have been entirely breaking ground in his &quot;Dred Scott&quot; opinion when he pronounced the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional because, among other reasons, an &quot;act of Congress that deprived a citizen of his liberty or property merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States, and who had committed no offence against the laws, could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law&quot;. Dissenting Justice Curtis disagreed with Taney about what &quot;due process&quot; meant in &quot;Dred Scott&quot;.

Criticisms of the doctrine continue as in the past. Critics argue that judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. &quot;legislating from the bench&quot;), or argue that judges are reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or argue that judges are claiming the power to expand the liberty of some people at the expense of other people&#x27;s liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or argue that judges are addressing substance instead of process.

Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a realist, worried that the Court was overstepping its boundaries, and the following is from one of his last dissents:
Originalists, such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who rejects substantive due process doctrine, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who has also questioned the legitimacy of the doctrine, call a substantive due process a &quot;judicial usurpation&quot; or an &quot;oxymoron&quot;. Both Scalia and Thomas have occasionally joined Court opinions that mention the doctrine, and have in their dissents often argued over how substantive due process should be employed based on Court precedent.

Many non-originalists, like Justice Byron White, have also been critical of a substantive due process. As propounded in his dissents in &quot;Moore v. East Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, as well as his majority opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, White argued that the doctrine of a substantive due process gives the judiciary too much power over the governance of the nation and takes away such power from the elected branches of government. He argued that the fact that the Court has created new substantive rights in the past should not lead it to &quot;repeat the process at will&quot;. In his book &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot;, non-originalist John Hart Ely criticized &quot;substantive due process&quot; as a glaring non-sequitur. Ely argued the phrase was a contradiction-in-terms, like the phrase &quot;green pastel redness&quot;.

Originalism is usually linked to opposition against substantive due process rights, and the reasons for that can be found in the following explanation that was endorsed unanimously by the Supreme Court in a 1985 case:
:&quot;[W]e must always bear in mind that the substantive content of the [due process] clause is suggested neither by its language nor by preconstitutional history; that content is nothing more than the accumulated product of judicial interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot;

Originalists do not necessarily oppose protection of the rights heretofore protected using substantive due process; rather, most originalists believe that such rights should be identified and protected through legislation, through passing amendments to the constitution, or via other existing provisions of the Constitution.

The perceived scope of the Due Process Clause has changed over time. For instance, even though many of the Framers of the Bill of Rights believed that slavery violated the fundamental natural rights of African-Americans:
:&quot;[a] theory that declared slavery to be a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment ... requires nothing more than a suspension of reason concerning the origin, intent, and past interpretation of the clause&quot;.

==Due process clauses in state constitutions==
No state or federal constitution in the U.S. had ever before utilized any &quot;due process&quot; wording, prior to 1791 when the federal Bill of Rights was ratified.

===New York===
In New York, a statutory bill of rights was enacted in 1787, and it contained four different due process clauses. Alexander Hamilton commented on the language of that New York bill of rights: &quot;The words &#x27;due process&#x27; have a precise technical import, and are only applicable to the process and proceedings of the courts of justice; they can never be referred to an act of the legislature.&quot;

<text>Ulf Gerhard Lundell (born 20 November 1949) is a Swedish writer, poet, songwriter, composer, musician and artist.

He made his debut in 1975 with the LP &quot;Vargmåne&quot; and was immediately hailed as &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Bob Dylan&quot;. In 1976 his first novel, the partly autobiographical &quot;Jack&quot; was published by Wahlström &amp; Widstrand. Lundell was influenced by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and other beats. Ulf Lundell is one of the central figures in Swedish rock music and almost since his debut he has been one of the most important influences on rock musicians writing and singing in Swedish. Lundell is also somewhat controversial and has argued with everyone from neo-nazis, feminists and communists to colleagues and music journalists.

Lundell was known as a heavy drinker in the 1980s, but pulled out of overdrinking after serious bouts with alcoholism in 1985–87; he gave a vivid report of this time, his recovery and his struggle with the rocker myth in the autobiographical novel &quot;En varg söker sin flock&quot; (1989; &quot;A Wolf in Search of his Pack&quot;)

&quot;Öppna landskap&quot; (Open landscapes) from 1982, one of his most famous songs, has been playfully proposed as Sweden&#x27;s new national anthem.

== Biography ==
=== Origins and musical beginnings ===
Ulf Lundell&#x27;s father was Gerhard Lundell a blacksmith worker and mother Ingrid () worked among other things as school meal assistant and seamstress. The family first lived in Stockholm in 1958 but moved to Saltsjö-Boo, east of Stockholm. At the age of ten he got his first guitar. Lundell has an older sister named Inger, whose boyfriend taught him his first chords. During the years 1967–75 Ulf Lundell had a variety of jobs, including postman. During these years he wrote songs and poems which he sent to record labels and publishers.

He sent a demo to MNW which they declined, telling him &quot;the material was not strong enough&quot;. Later he sent two demos to Silence, which were also rejected. When he sent a demo to EMI in October 1974 they wanted to record an LP with him. In 1975 he made his debut with the album &quot;Vargmåne&quot; (&quot;Wolf Moon&quot;). The following year, 1976, came his first novel, &quot;Jack&quot;, with which he made his breakthrough. The novel is about rebellion against &quot;Medelsvensson&quot; (Average Joes) circumscribed life in the aftermath of the political uprising at the end of the 1960s. The book had an initial print run of 2,000 copies but ultimately sold 200,000 copies. Meanwhile, when his first work was released, he had already started recording the sequel to &quot;Vargmåne&quot;. The second album would be called Törst (&quot;Thirst&quot;) and released just three months after &quot;Jack&quot;. After that floated on the writing of books and two more were released during the 1970s. &quot;Törst&quot; was followed by the live album &quot;Natten hade varit mild och öm&quot; (&quot;The night was mild and tender&quot;) with Nature as backing band for years. The album &quot;Nådens år&quot; (&quot;Year of Grace&quot;) in 1978 year would become his third studio album including a duet with Agnetha Fältskog, &quot;Snön faller och vi med den&quot; (&quot;Snow Falls And We With It&quot;). In 1979 Lundell released his fourth studio album &quot;Ripp rapp&quot; with songs like &quot;Rom i regnet&quot; and &quot;(Oh la la) Jag vill ha dej&quot;. &quot;Ripp rapp&quot; was more rock than his previous albums.

=== 1980s ===
In the fall of 1980 Lundell released the album &quot;Längre inåt landet&quot;, which was recorded in England. The album includes songs like &quot;Glad igen&quot; (&quot;Happy Again&quot;) and &quot;Stackars Jack&quot; (&quot;Poor Jack&quot;). The latter was a comment on the criticism Lundell got from his debut novel &quot;Jack&quot;. Two years later, in 1982, he released the album &quot;Kär och galen&quot; (&quot;In love and crazy&quot;) that contained his most famous work, the song &quot;Öppna landskap&quot; (&quot;Open landscapes&quot;). It made him one of the biggest artists, and sold four times platinum. Other songs that became popular from &quot;Kär och galen&quot; was the title track &quot;Kär och galen&quot; and &quot;När jag kysser havet&quot; (&quot;When I kiss the sea&quot;).

While waiting for a proper sequel to &quot;Kär och galen&quot; Lundell released two records, one in which he interpreted the English songs with Swedish lyrics (&quot;Sweethearts&quot;) and a completely acoustic album (&quot;12 sånger&quot;). Ulf wrestled with severe alcohol problems during this time, which among other things, led to the postponing of his upcoming album several times. During the summer tour in 1985, he did a real disastrous gig in Borgholm drunk, which put him on some headlines in the newspapers. In the fall Lundell released &quot;Den vassa eggen&quot; (&quot;The Sharp Edge&quot;), an album heavily influenced by the divorce Lundell went through at the time of recording. &quot;Den vassa eggen&quot; was very critically acclaimed and was followed by yet another scandal tour in the fall of that year. In 1987 Lundell released the only book Lundell acknowledged writing intoxicated, &quot;Tårpilen&quot; and also the album &quot;Det ljuva livet&quot; (&quot;The Good Life&quot;).

Lundell alcohol abuse got so bad that he joined Alcoholics Anonymous at this time. 1988 he stated that he had met God and was baptized shortly thereafter in the Ebeneser Church. His newfound Christian faith came to color in the album &quot;Evangeline&quot;, which was released the same year. 1989 he released his autobiography &quot;En varg söker sin flock&quot; (&quot;A Wolf in Search of his Pack&quot;) and the album &quot;Utanför murarna&quot; (&quot;Outside the Walls&quot;). He has also been active as a visual artist from 1989.

===1990s–present ===
It took until 1992 for Lundell to release a new book or album with the novel &quot;Saknaden&quot;. The book came to be the first installment of a trilogy. 1993 he released the album &quot;Måne över Haväng&quot;, which contains songs that include &quot;Rött&quot; and &quot;Isabella&quot;. This was the first album that Lundell produced entirely by himself. 1994 he formed his own production company Rockhead Studios AB and its subsidiaries Rockhead Productions and Rockhead Art and secondary name Rockhead Music. That same year he released the acoustic album &quot;&quot;. At this time Lundell invested more in music than on writing.

In 1995 Lundell celebrated 20 years as an artist. The following year he released double album &quot;På andra sidan drömmarna&quot; and the live album &quot;Bosnia&quot;. At this time one can notice that he was inspired more by Neil Young than before Springsteen and Dylan. Especially with the album &quot;Fanzine&quot; (1999), which is a disc that is partially recorded in a studio and partly live. 1999 he released his first book in seven years, the sequel to the novel &quot;Saknaden&quot;, called &quot;Friheten&quot;.

The album &quot;I ett vinterland&quot; (2000) became his second best-selling album. The album was followed two years later with the double album &quot;Club Zebra&quot;, an album that was number one in Sweden October 17, 2002. Then followed four studio albums until 2005, the acoustic &quot;En eld ikväll&quot; and album trilogy &quot;Ok Ok Baby&quot;, &quot;Högtryck&quot; and &quot;Lazarus&quot;. 2005 was a very productive year for Lundell with two albums and the novel &quot;Värmen&quot;, the last part of a trilogy with &quot;Saknaden&quot; and &quot;Friheten&quot;. This was the year he celebrated 30 years as an artist.

In the autumn of 2008, Lundell toured for the first time in over two years and also released his first studio album in three years. During the tour premiere of Gävle Lundell told the newspapers he was about to stop touring. The tour continued in 2009 with one in the spring and one in the summer. In connection with these he admits that he lied and will not stop touring. He explains that he is about to take farewell from his artistic career, but it&#x27;s a long farewell. 2010 Lundell released a new book, &quot;En öppen vinter&quot;, also containing a CD with 11 new songs.

In the summer of 2010, Lundell embarked on a new tour in which he broke the audience record for a Swedish artist at Gröna Lund on 30 July. The concert was attended by 22,827 people; with that figure, he is only beaten by Bob Marley (32,000) and Lady Gaga (23,000).

A concert tour that Lundell would have embarked on in the spring of 2011 was completely cancelled due to sickness.

== Personal life ==
Lundell was married the first time in 1977 to Barbro Zackrisson. They broke up in 1988. In 1989, Lundell married Fredrika Stjärne, they broke up in 1991. He has three children from his first marriage, including the journalist Sanna Lundell, and one from the other. During the mid-1990s, he was dating the poet Isabella Nerman (whom he also wrote a song about, simply called &quot;Isabella&quot;). During a period in the 2000s he was living with Ulrika Rickfors.

<text>Eben-Ezer () is a location that is mentioned by the Books of Samuel as the scene of battles between the Israelites and Philistines. It is specified as having been less than a day&#x27;s journey by foot from Shiloh, near Aphek, in the neighbourhood of Mizpah, near the western entrance of the pass of Bethoron. Its location has not been identified in modern times with much certainty, with some identifying it with Beit Iksa, and others with Dayr Aban.

== Biblical mentions ==
The placename appears in the Books of Samuel in two narratives:

* In the first narrative (), the Philistines defeat the Israelites, even though the Israelites bring the Ark of the Covenant onto the battlefield in hope of bringing about a divinely assured victory. The victorious Philistines capture the Ark, and do not return it until many months later (1 Samuel 6:1–2).
* In the second narrative (), the Israelites defeat the Philistines after Samuel has offered a sacrifice. Samuel puts up a stone in memorial and names it &quot;Eben-Ezer&quot; (the placename in the previous narrative resulting from this). The hymn &quot;Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing&quot; refers to this monument.

== Modern-day placement ==
It is currently accepted among many Israeli archaeologists and historians to place the Eben-Ezer of the first narrative in the immediate neighborhood of modern-day Kafr Qasim, near Antipatris (ancient city Aphek). In contrast, the second battle&#x27;s location is deemed insufficiently well-defined in the Biblical text. The other proposed site is called &quot;Isbet Sartah&quot;. Some scholars hold that there was more than one Aphek. C. R. Conder identified the Aphek of Eben-Ezer with a khirbet &quot;ruin&quot; some distant from Dayr Aban (believed to be Eben-Ezer), and known by the name &quot;Marj al-Fikiya&quot;; the name &quot;al-Fikiya&quot; being an Arabic etymological variant of Aphek. Eusebius, when writing about Eben-Ezer in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, says that it is &quot;the place from which the Gentiles seized the Ark, between Jerusalem and Ascalon, near the village of Bethsamys (Beit Shemesh)&quot;, a locale that corresponds with Conder&#x27;s identification. The same site, near Beth Shemesh, has also been identified by Epiphanius of Salamis as Eben-Ezer.

<text>Legal deposit is a legal requirement that a person or group submit copies of their publications to a repository, usually a library. The number of copies required varies from country to country. Typically, the national library is the primary repository of these copies. In some countries there is also a legal deposit requirement placed on the government, and it is required to send copies of documents to publicly accessible libraries.

The legislation covering the requirement varies from country to country, but is often enshrined in copyright law. Until the late 20th century, legal deposit covered only printed and sometimes audio-visual materials, but in the 21st century, most countries have had to extend their legislation to cover digital documents as well. In 2000, UNESCO published a new and enlarged edition of Jean Lunn&#x27;s &quot;1981 Guidelines for Legal Deposit Legislation&quot;, which addresses the issue of electronic formats in its recommendations for the construction of legal deposit legislation.

The number of books deposited in national legal repositories increased from 2.4 million in 2018 to 2.7 million in 2019, mainly due to a substantial growth in digital deposits. 

==By country==

===Albania===
In Albania, section 41-47 of the law &quot;On books in the Republic of Albania&quot; (no. 9616/2006) requires publishers of &quot;printed books, brochures, posters, postal cards, maps, geographic atlases, and musical and choreographical scores&quot; to deposit 5 copies without compensation at the National Library of Albania, the Library of the Albanian Parliament, and the local public library of the municipality the publisher operates in. Each new printing is subject to the same conditions.

===Australia===

In Australia, section 201 of the &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot; and other state acts requires that a copy of all materials published in Australia be deposited with the National Library of Australia. State laws require books and a wide range of other materials published in each state to be deposited in the applicable state library. New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia also require books published in those states to be deposited in the library of the state parliament. New South Wales law also requires books published in that state to be deposited in the University of Sydney library.

The relevant legislation governing deposit of items to state and territory libraries are: the &quot;Publications (Legal Deposit) Act 2004&quot; (NT); the &quot;Libraries Act 1988&quot; (Qld), the &quot;Libraries Act 1984&quot; (Tas), Section 35 of the &quot;Libraries Act 1982&quot; (SA), the &quot;Libraries Act 1939&quot; (NSW), Section 49 of the &quot;Libraries Act 1988&quot; (Vic), and the &quot;Legal Deposit Act 2012&quot; (WA) The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has no local legislation , but publishers &quot;are encouraged to lodge a copy of their publications with the ACT Heritage Library for ongoing preservation and access&quot;.

The &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot; and legal deposit legislation pertaining to each state mandates that publishers of any kind must deposit copies of their publications in the National Library of Australia as well as in the state or territory library in their jurisdiction. Until the 21st century, this has applied to all types of printed materials (and in some states, to audio-visual formats as well). On 17 February 2016, the federal legal deposit provisions were extended (by &quot;Statute Law Revision Act (No. 1) 2016&quot;) to cover electronic publications of all types. By July 2018, while the Northern Territory was the only jurisdiction with legislation with explicit mention of &quot;internet publications&quot; (in its &quot;Publications (Legal Deposit) Act 2004&quot;), Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Libraries Act 1988&quot; and Tasmania&#x27;s &quot;Libraries Act 1984&quot; were broad enough to include digital publications. Most states and territories have been reviewing or amending existing legislation to extend to digital publications as well. The State Library of South Australia requires that electronic publications should be deposited rather than print whenever possible&quot;. In June 2019, New South Wales passed new legislation, the &quot;Library Amendment Act 2019&quot;, which amended the &quot;Library Act 1939&quot; and repealed previous legal deposit legislation, the &quot;Copyright Act 1879&quot; (NSW). The change means that legal deposit now applies to all formats, including digital.

Under the legislation (section 195CD (1) (c) (i)), publishers are required to deposit digital publications without technological protection measures (TPM) or digital rights management (DRM); that is, the copy must contain all content and functionality, without protection measures such as password protection or subscription paywalls.

===Austria===
===Belgium===

===Brazil===

Legal deposit legislation in Brazil (&quot;Depósito legal&quot;), federal laws number 10994
and 12192,
requires that one copy &lt;!— LEI No 10.994, Art. 2o, item I, &quot;um ou mais exemplares&quot;, that is, ONE OR MORE. Today the standard is ONE. See http://www.bn.br/portal/?nu_pagina=22 —&gt; of every book, music or periodical published in the country be sent to the National Library of Brazil (known as Biblioteca Nacional, Biblioteca do Rio de Janeiro, or Fundação Biblioteca Nacional), located in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

=== Brunei ===
Under the Preservation of Books Act (1967, revised in 1984), three copies of every &quot;book, report, pamphlet, periodical, newspaper, sheet of letterpress, sheet of music, map, plan, chart or table separated published&quot; shall be delivered to the Director of Museums within one month after the publication at one&#x27;s own expense.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Library and Archives of Canada Act (2004) specifies that up to two copies of any published material must be deposited with Library and Archives Canada. Materials deposited in the archives are catalogued; the catalogs are available as part of the Library and Archives Canada website. The province of Quebec also requires deposit of two copies of any document be deposited to within seven days of its publication.

===China===

In China, Article 22 of &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Publication&quot; (2001) states that three copies of each printed publication should be submitted to the National Library of China, one copy to the Archives Library of Chinese Publications and one copy to the administrative department for publication under the State Council.

===Colombia===

In Colombia, the law of legal deposit is regulated by Law 44 of 1993, the statutory Decree 460 of March 16 of 1999, and Decree 2150 of 1995. These laws and decrees are specifically about the National Library of Colombia. The creators of printed works, as well as audiovisual, audio, and video productions, should supply the library with a specified number of copies of the works, whether they were produced within the Colombian territory or imported.
* For printed works, two copies of each of the works produced within the national territory should be delivered to the National Library of Colombia; one copy to the &quot;Biblioteca del Congreso de la República de Colombia&quot; (Library of the Congress of the Republic of Colombia), and one copy to the Central Library of the &quot;Universidad Nacional de Colombia&quot; (National University of Colombia), excepting a few cases in which the high cost of the edition or the short duration of publication makes it possible to deliver fewer copies.
* For audiovisual and audio works, as well as for published works that have been imported, only one copy needs to be delivered to the National Library.

===Costa Rica===
The National Library of Costa Rica is obliged by law (&quot;Printing Law and Copyright [Author Rights Law] and Related Rights Law&quot;) to hold three copies of every publication in the country.

===Croatia===
In Croatia, legal deposit was established in 1816. Today, it is regulated by the Libraries Act, which stipulates nine copies should be supplied by the publishers. Of these, two are received by the National and University Library in Zagreb, while university and scientific libraries in Osijek, Rijeka, Pula, Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik and Mostar receive one copy each.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, legal deposit has been required since 1697, and is handled by the Royal Danish Library (for most written works) and by the State and University Library (for newspapers, audio, and video); two copies must be supplied. This also includes works in digital format, and the publisher may be required to supply the necessary passwords.

===Faroe Islands===
Legal deposit of four copies of every publication is required to the National Library of the Faroe Islands under a law passed on July 16, 1952.

===Finland===
In Finland, The Royal Academy of Turku was given right to receive a copy of all works published in Sweden in 1707. After Finland had been ceded by Sweden to Russia, this privilege was confirmed in 1809. In 1820, all Russian print presses began to send legal deposit copies to Finland.

Gaining its independence in 1917, Finland retained the principles of legal deposit. Helsinki University Library (the university had been transferred from Turku in 1827) remained the main deposit library. Additional copies began to be deposited in other libraries in Turku, Jyväskylä, and Vyborg (later Oulu). In 1984, the obligation to deposit was expanded to audiovisual materials; responsibility to preserve films was given to the National Audiovisual Institute.

A new act on depositing and preservation of cultural materials was given in 2007. The new act covers two new important types of cultural materials. The National Audiovisual Archive collects and preserves broadcast materials, whereas the National Library of Finland (Helsinki University Library renamed) takes care of capturing and preserving Web content.

===France===
In France, legal deposit was initiated by the Ordonnance de Montpellier of 1537, under which a copy of any published book had to be delivered to the king&#x27;s library, for conservation purposes. During the following centuries, legal deposit was sometimes used to facilitate censorship and the obligation was thus removed briefly during the French Revolution, under the argument that it violated freedom of speech. The main depository is the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Legal deposit is extremely developed and concerns not only printed material but also multimedia archives and even some web pages.

France is also unique in the world in funding the Osmothèque, a legal deposit scent and fragrance archive to preserve perfume formulas.

===Germany===

In Germany, since 1913 publishing houses bound by a contract with the booksellers&#x27; guild, the &quot;Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels&quot;, were required to send a so-called &quot;Pflichtexemplar&quot; of each book in print and stock to the &quot;Deutsche Bücherei&quot; in Leipzig. After World War II, &quot;Deutsche Bücherei&quot; kept going in East Germany, while the &quot;Deutsche Bibliothek&quot; was founded in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany. Legal deposits kept being required strictly by Private Law, organised by the Börsenverein and the German booksellers. Since 1969, the German National Library Law (&quot;Gesetz über die Deutsche Bibliothek&quot; vom 31. März 1969, BGBl. I S. 265) required that two copies of each print publication and of some non-print publications be sent to the German National Library in either Frankfurt am Main or Leipzig (depending on the publisher&#x27;s location). The act was replaced in 2006 by the German National Library Act, as the &quot;German National Library&quot;, or &quot;Deutsche Nationalbibilothek&quot;, was founded. Additionally, each federal state of Germany requires that one or two copies of works published in that state be deposited in the respective state repository.

===Hong Kong===
Under section 3 of the Books Registration Ordinance the publisher of a new book shall, within one month after the book is published, printed, produced or otherwise made in Hong Kong, deliver to the Secretary for Broadcasting, Culture and Sport free of charge five copies of the book.

A person who contravenes such requirement shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of HK$2000.

The secretary is required to send one copy to the City Hall Library, which was the main library of the previous Urban Council or such other library as he may approve.

This requirement did not include any library under the previous Regional Council (another municipal council in Hong Kong), and was not amended since the Hong Kong Central Library was open and replaced the City Hall Library as the main library for the whole territory.

===Hungary===
===Iceland===
In Iceland, four copies of any published, printed, material must be sent to the National and University Library of Iceland in Reykjavík, three of which will be kept there, and one of which will be kept at Amtsbókasafnið á Akureyri in Akureyri. If fewer than 50 copies are made only two are required.

===India===

The Delivery of Books Act 1954 enacted by the Indian parliament regulates the deposit of books published in India to the National Library of India, Kolkata and three other libraries namely, Connemara Public Library, Chennai; Central Library, Mumbai and the Delhi Public Library. The Act was amended in 1956 to include periodicals and newspapers. The Indian National Bibliography is compiled on the receipt of books received under Delivery of Books Act at the National Library, Kolkata.

===Ireland===
One copy of each book and periodical published in the Republic of Ireland must be deposited with the National Library of Ireland (NLI), the British Library, and each of the seven university libraries: Trinity College Library and those of the University of Limerick (UL), Dublin City University (DCU), and the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland (NUI). Four other British libraries can submit a written request for a copy within a year: the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales. Irish publishers have complained at the obligation to supply up to 13 free copies of works which may have a small print run. Trinity College Library incurs expense, partly reimbursed from public funds, in receiving UK books and acting as a clearing house for Irish books sent for UK deposit.

The Irish Free State in 1922 inherited the UK&#x27;s Copyright Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 46), which made Trinity College Library and those in the UK the legal deposits for UK-published books. When the Free State&#x27;s first copyright law was debated in 1927, it was decided to retain Trinity College Library rather than the NLI as the deposit for UK books, on the grounds of continuity. It retains the status . Originally the 1927 bill proposed only to add the NLI as a deposit for Free State publishing; in committee the three then constituent colleges of the NUI were added as well, while status of the lesser British libraries was reduced from automatic to by request. St Patrick&#x27;s College (predecessor of NUI Maynooth) was added in 1963, and UL and DCU in 1989 on promotion to university status. In 2000, the deposit requirement was extended to e-publishing, and libraries could request digital copies in addition to hard copies. In 2017, the NLI began a consultation on extending legal deposit to born-digital resources, which it had begun preserving in 2011 from voluntary deposits.

===Israel===
In Israel, &quot;The Books Law 2000 (5761)&quot; requires two copies of each publication to be sent to the National Library of Israel. The library of the Knesset and the Israel State Archive are each entitled to receive one copy upon request.

The government authorities are required by the &quot;Freedom of Information Act, 1999&quot; to send an annual report of their actions to the public library of every town with 5,000 people or more.

===Italy===

In Italy, the law on legal deposit () requires a copy of each publication to be sent to both the National Central Library of Florence and National Central Library of Rome, as it has been since the institution of the Kingdom of Italy (1861).

In addition, the regions determine local regional and provincial legal deposit libraries, which receive two more copies and often inherit that status from their pre-unification history. For instance, the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense is the legal deposit library in Lombardy since 1788 (when it covered the Duchy of Milan) and the National Central Library of Florence since 1743 (for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany).

===Japan===
The legal deposit requirements for Japan&#x27;s National Diet Library are specified in Chapters X through XI-3 of the National Diet Library Law. These requirements vary based on whether the publishing entity is governmental or nongovernmental, and on whether the work is published physically or online. Required works are books, pamphlets, serials, music scores, maps, films, other documents or charts, phonographic records, and digital text, images, sounds, or programs. Nongovernmental publishers must submit a single copy, and are entitled to &quot;compensation equivalent to the expenses usually required for the issue and deposit of the publication;&quot; noncompliance is subject to a fine.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, the legal deposit regulation is covered under the Books and Newspaper Act Cap. 111 of 1960. It covers books (any volume), encyclopaedia, magazines, review, gazette, pamphlet, leaflet, sheet of letterpress, sheet of music, map, plan and chart. However, it gives exceptions to letter heading, price list, annual reports, trade circular, trade advertisement, government publications, legal, trade or business document. The Acts gives the mandate to Kenya National Library Service and the Registrar of Books and Newspapers. According to the Act, publishers should deposit two copies with the Director, Kenya National Library Service and not more than three copies to the Registrar of Books and Newspapers as it may be specified. The regulations were last reviewed in the year 2002 where penalties were specified for non-compliance.

===Liechtenstein===
The Liechtenstein State Library, colloquially known as the State Library, was formally established by law by the National Library Foundation in 1961. The State Library possesses a legal depository. As per the amended statutes, the roles of the State Library changed as such: the State Library now functions as a national library as well as a scientific and public library. As a national library, the State Library collects print materials, pictures and music created by citizens of Liechtenstein as well as items related to Liechtenstein. Also, the State Library acts as a patent library for the Principality of Liechtenstein and as such provides access to comprehensive international patent information. The State Library&#x27;s rules and regulations must follow the current legislation under Liechtenstein&#x27;s European Economic Area as well as Swiss legislation.

===Macau===
Decree-Law No. 72/89/M requires that copies of works published in Macau be deposited with the Macao Central Library.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, according to the &quot;Akta Penyerahan Bahan Perpustakaan 1986&quot; (Deposit of Library Material Act 1986), five copies of printed library materials including books, printed materials, maps, charts and posters must be deposited to the National Library of Malaysia. In addition, two copies of non-printed library materials must also be deposited.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the &quot;General Library Law&quot; states that two specimens of each physical book, publication, magazine, newspaper, map, brochure, poster, music sheet, record, movie or photograph published should be donated to each of the following libraries: National Library of Mexico, Biblioteca de México José Vasconcelos, Library of the Congress of Mexico, or one specimen if in electronic or digital format.

===Monaco===
In Monaco four copies of locally produced books, computer software and media must be deposited in the Bibliothèque Louis Notari. If fewer than 100 copies were produced only two copies are required.

===New Zealand===
Legal deposit was initiated in 1903 in New Zealand, and currently requires that copies of all printed documents and offline electronic documents (e.g. DVDs) be sent to the National Library of New Zealand within 20 working days of publication. It also empowers the National Librarian to make copies of Internet documents including websites. If asked for assistance in making copies of their Internet documents, publishers must comply within 20 working days. This process is given legal force by Part 4 of the National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa) Act 2003, as well as three supporting requirements notices. If more than 100 copies are printed in total, two copies must be provided, otherwise one. If the price of one copy is greater than $1,000 NZD, only one copy is required.

===Norway===
Publications in Norway, &quot;regardless of the format of publication&quot;, including digital documents, must be deposited with the National Library of Norway.

=== Poland ===
Since 1780 the Załuski Library has been entitled to a copy of all works published in Poland. In modern times the issue is regulated by 

For software and traditional publications with a print run of up to 100 copies, the National Library of Poland and the Jagiellonian Library must receive one copy each, which are to be stored indefinitely. For publications with a larger run, they receive two copies, and 13 other libraries receive one, to be stored for &quot;no less than 50 years&quot;: library of the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, library of the University of Łódź, Nicolaus Copernicus University Library, library of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, University of Warsaw Library, library of the University of Wrocław, Silesian Library, City of Warsaw Library, Pomeranian Library in Szczecin, library of the University of Gdańsk, library of the Catholic University of Lublin, library of the University of Opole, and Podlaskie Library in Białystok.

Legal deposits are handled free of charge by the Polish Post. Failure to provide a legal deposit is penalised by fine.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, all publishers are currently required to deposit 11 copies of all publications, which are distributed between the National Library of Portugal, municipal libraries of major cities, and the libraries of public institutions of science and higher learning. Special exceptions, of which only one copy is required (and stored in the National Library), include Masters and PhD dissertations, limited prints, stamps, plans, posters, among others.

=== Romania ===

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the &quot;National Library Board Act&quot; requires all publishers in Singapore to deposit two copies of every publication to the National Library Board at their own expense within four weeks from the publication date.

===Slovenia===
The forerunner of the National and University Library of Slovenia, the Lyceum Library of Ljubljana was established around 1774 by a decree issued by Maria Theresa from the remains of the Jesuit Library and several monastery libraries. The submission of legal deposit copies to the Lyceum library became mandatory with a decree published by the Austrian court in 1807, at first only in Carniola, except for a short period of French occupation, when it received copies from all the Illyrian provinces. In 1919, it was named &quot;State Reference Library&quot; and started to collect legal deposit copies from the Slovenia of the time. In the same year, the University of Ljubljana (the first Slovenian university) was established and the library served its needs too. In 1921, it started to acquire legal deposit copies from the entire Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was named the University Library in 1938. Digitalna knjižnica Slovenije (Digital library of Slovenia) is a project of the National and University Library of Slovenia.

===South Africa===
In South Africa the Legal Deposit Act, 1997 requires publishers to provide five copies of every book published, if the print run consists of 100 or more copies. These copies must be deposited in the National Library of South Africa (NLSA) in Cape Town, the NLSA in Pretoria, the Mangaung Library Services in Bloemfontein, the Msunduzi Municipal Library in Pietermaritzburg, and the Library of Parliament in Cape Town. If the print run is less than 100 copies, then only one copy is required, to be deposited in the NLSA in Cape Town. If it is less than 20 copies, then no deposit is required.

For films, videos and sound recordings, the requirements are the same, except that the National Film, Video and Sound Archives (NFVSA) receives a deposit copy instead of the Library of Parliament, and if only one copy is required it is deposited in the NFVSA rather than the NLSA.

===South Korea===
Article 20 of the Library Act requires that one or two copies of any tangible material published or produced in the country be sent to the National Library of Korea within 30 days for permanent preservation. Copies of online materials must be submitted on demand.

===Spain===

In Spain, the obligation to deposit copies of printed materials has existed since 1619 for the Royal Library of El Escorial and since 1716 for the Royal Library of Madrid (later the National Library of Spain). From this moment, there followed multiple provisions, in the 19th century termed &quot;legal deposit&quot;, all with the aim of enforcing compliance.

The decree of 1957 established a solid administrative base for legal deposit in Spain, based on the separation between provincial offices that managed legal deposit at the local level and conservation libraries, such as the National Library. The decree stipulated that printers were responsible for depositing several copies of all published works at the National Library and other public libraries. This legal deposit legislation covered a wide range of materials, including printed materials such as books and magazines, sound recordings, maps, movies, and postcards.

The 1957 decree, though superseded by other decrees in 1971 and 1973, remained almost intact until 2011, when a new legal deposit law was passed on July 29, 2011. Law 23/2011 established, among other things, that the publisher, not the printer, was the primary entity responsible for submitting its materials to legal deposit. It also established procedures for the legal deposit of electronic materials, including online ones. The number of copies that must be delivered to each library varies between two and four according to the type of material. Through legal deposit, the National Library collects all materials published in Spain. The central libraries for each autonomous community collect works published in their respective communities, and provincial libraries collect works published in their respective provinces.

===Sri Lanka===
First legal deposit of Sri Lanka was established in 1885 at the National Museum Library. The law of the country (according to National Archives Act No. 48 of 1973). requires that a copy of every document printed in the country has to be deposited in the legal deposit. There are five legal deposits in the country. These are the National Archives of Sri Lanka, the National Library of Sri Lanka, the National Museum Library, the University of Peradeniya library and the Library, University of Ruhuna.

===Sweden===
The Swedish Legal Deposit Act originates in 1661. According to present legislation, copies of printed material, sound and moving images has to be sent to The National Library of Sweden and Lund University Library (no audiovisual material). In 2012 the Legal Deposit Act for Electronic Material was passed. It states that starting in 2015, publishing companies and public authorities must deliver digitally published content to the National Library. In 2013-14 electronic legal deposits will start in a smaller scale.

===Switzerland===
There is no federal law establishing legal deposit in Switzerland, however, the cantons of Vaud, Fribourg, Geneva, and Ticino have enacted legal deposit laws applying to books published within their respective jurisdictions. On a national level, the Swiss National Library (SNL) has voluntary agreements in place with the two main publishers&#x27; associations in the country; , and Association Suisse des Diffuseurs, Editeurs et Libraires, under which the SNL receives a copy of every book published by associated publishers.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the Library Act requires that a copy of a work should be deposited with the National Central Library and the Parliamentary Library of the Legislative Yuan. There are only two university library selected as Legal deposit destination — National Dong Hwa University Library and National Taiwan University Library.

===United Kingdom===

There are six legal deposit libraries under UK law: the British Library, the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, Cambridge University Library, and Trinity College Dublin Library. Although the Irish Free State left the UK in 1922, Trinity College remains a UK deposit library, and the UK libraries reciprocally retain deposit rights for Irish publications.

Legal deposit in the United Kingdom traces its origins to an agreement between Sir Thomas Bodley and the Stationers&#x27; Company that copies of new books would be added to the Bodleian collection. The Statute of Anne (1710) formalised the practice by extending it, in England, to the Royal Library (now the British Library), Cambridge University, and the library of Sion College, and, in Scotland, to the Advocates Library and the universities of St. Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. After the Union with Ireland, an 1801 act extended deposit to Trinity College and King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin. From 1814, publishers supplied institutions upon request rather than automatically. In 1836, Sion College, King&#x27;s Inns, and the Scottish universities were removed from the list, compensated with a book stipend equal to the average annual value of books deposited over the preceding three years. The Copyright Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 46) gave limited deposit rights to the National Library of Wales, with full rights coming in 1987. The Advocates Library&#x27;s right was transferred to the National Library of Scotland upon its 1925 creation.

The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 restates section 15 of the Copyright Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 46), that one copy of every book (which includes pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, sheet music and maps) published there must be sent to the British Library. The other five deposit libraries are entitled to request a free copy within one year of publication, a process which they normally coordinate jointly through Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries. The 2003 Act sets out provisions for the deposit of non-print works. This legislation was updated with the introduction of secondary legislation, The Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013, which make provision for the legal deposit of works published online or offline in formats other than print, such as websites, blogs, e-journals and CD-ROMs. Social media content is included in the legislation, but not private message sent via social media platforms. Pure video streaming websites are also excluded from the legislation.

In the United Kingdom, the purpose of legal deposits is to &quot;preserve knowledge and information for future generations and &#x27;maintain the national published archive of the British Isles&#x27;. The purpose and intent for preserving publications for national posterity applied to other countries as well, including the United States. According to Thomas Lidman, &quot;[l]egal deposit is the foundation on which to build national library services, it helps to ensure that the country&#x27;s intellectual heritage will be preserved and available for study&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, the Copyright Act requires that any copyrighted and published work must be submitted in two copies to the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress does not retain all works. This mandatory deposit is not required to possess copyright of unpublished works, but a copyright registration can give an author enhanced remedies in case of a copyright violation. This optional registration also requires depositing two copies of the work and therefore also satisfies mandatory deposit requirements. If a foreign publisher distributes works in the US, they must also comply with the mandatory requirements.

In August 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the mandatory deposit requirement is an unconstitutional violation of property rights. The separate deposit requirement to optionally register copyright, however, remains in place.

Another type of depository library in the United States are federal depository libraries, which are entitled to free copies of all materials (digital, print, microform, etc.) published by the Government Publishing Office. By accepting these materials, the libraries commit to providing free public access to the depository collection, and they agree to hold the materials for no fewer than five years (with some exceptions); large &quot;regional&quot; depositories also commit to holding these materials indefinitely. There are currently 1,114 such depository libraries in the United States, though the number of federal publications each receives varies based upon their selection profile. This Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) is not affiliated with the Library of Congress and should not be confused with the aforementioned copyright deposit program.

<text>Gedaliah ( or ; &quot;Gəḏalyyā)&quot; was a person from the Bible who was a governor of Yehud province. He was also the son of Ahikam, who saved prophet Jeremiah.

== Names ==
Gedaliah ( or ; &quot;Gəḏalyyā&quot; or &quot;Gəḏalyyāhū&quot;; also written Gedalia, Gedallah, Gedalya, or Gedalyah) means &quot;Yah(weh) is Great&quot;.

== Background ==
Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam (who saved the life of the prophet Jeremiah) and the grandson of Shaphan (who is mentioned in relation to the discovery of the scroll of Teaching that some scholars identify as the core of the book of Deuteronomy).

== Governorship ==
Gedaliah was according to the narratives in the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Book of Jeremiah and Second Book of Kings, appointed by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon as governor of Yehud province, which was formed after the defeat of the Kingdom of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem, in a part of the territory that previously formed the kingdom. He was supported by a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah. On hearing of the appointment, the Jews that had taken refuge in surrounding countries returned to Judah. 

He zealously began to encourage the people to cultivate the fields and vineyards, and thus lay the foundation of security. Many who had fled to neighboring lands during the war of destruction were attracted by the news of the revival of the community. They came to Gedaliah in Mizpah and were warmly welcomed by him.

== Assassination ==
Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, murdered Gedaliah, together with most of the Jews who had joined him and many Babylonians whom Nebuchadnezzar had left with Gedaliah (). The remaining Judeans feared the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar and fled to Egypt. Although the dates are not clear from the Bible, this probably happened about 582/1 BCE (,), some four to five years and three months after the destruction of Jerusalem and the First Temple in 586 BCE.

==Fast of Gedaliah==

To lament the assassination of Gedaliah, which left Judah devoid of any Jews and Jewish rule and completed the destruction of the First Temple, the Jewish Sages established the third day of Tishrei as the Fast of Gedaliah. Although Gedaliah&#x27;s assassination perhaps occurred on the first day of Tishrei, the fast is observed on the third day so as not to coincide with Rosh Hashanah.

<text>Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) is a public community college with multiple campuses in the Greater Boston area. Founded in 1973 in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, BHCC provides higher education and job training services at two campuses and three satellite locations.

BHCC is the state&#x27;s largest community college, enrolling more than 13,000 students in day, afternoon, evening, late-evening, weekend, and web-based distance-learning courses. It is also one of the state&#x27;s most diverse institutions of higher education: 24% of the students are African-American, 24% are white or caucasian, and 24% Latino. More than half are women. Students&#x27; average age is 27. The college enrolls more than 800 international students who come from about 100 countries and speak more than 75 languages.

==History==

Bunker Hill Community College&#x27;s main campus is in Boston&#x27;s Charlestown neighborhood, on the site of the former Charlestown State Prison that closed in 1955. It is served by the MBTA Orange Line rapid transit station called Community College, and sits near the site of the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolutionary War. Bunker Hill Community College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Since 1987, a second campus has provided higher education and job training to residents of Chelsea, Revere, Everett, East Boston, Winthrop and other surrounding communities. This campus moved several times until settling in 1998 into a former post office in Bellingham Square. The two-story 1910 brick structure had been vacant for a decade before being donated to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

In Boston&#x27;s South End, BHCC worked with Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA), a community-based organization, to establish the Pathway Technology Campus (PTC) in Villa Victoria, a predominantly-Latino affordable-housing community. PTC helps residents of the South End and Lower Roxbury earn a GED certificate, take adult education (ESL, Basic English and Math) classes, and to enroll in community college-level classes.

Since 2007, BHCC has operated an East Boston Satellite campus at the Education and Training Institute of the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center. It offers introductory and allied health courses in the evening during the fall, spring and summer terms.

Established in fall 2009, the Malden Satellite is based at Malden High School in Malden, Massachusetts, and offers introductory and college-level courses in the evening during the fall and spring semesters.

The college was featured in the 1997 movie &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, as the location where Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) teaches.

On July 1, 2013, Pam Y. Eddinger became BHCC&#x27;s seventh president, replacing Mary L. Fifield, who retired after 16 years.

<doc id="629741" wikidata="Q2937241" url="?curid=629741" title="Cape Breton—Canso">
<text>Cape Breton—Canso is a federal electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004. Its population in 2011 was 75,247. It is the successor to Bras d&#x27;Or (later known as Bras d&#x27;Or—Cape Breton), which was represented in the House of Commons from 1997 to 2004.

==Demographics==

&quot;From the 2016 census&quot;

Languages (mother tongue): 90.8% English, 6.5% French, 1.2% Mi&#x27;kmaq, 0.4% German, 0.2% Dutch, 0.1%Mandarin, 0.1% Arabic, 0.1% Scottish Gaelic, 0.1% Tagalog

Average age: 46.4

Average household size: 2.3

==Geography==
The district includes eastern Guysborough County, and the western, southern and eastern coasts of Cape Breton Island. Communities include Glace Bay, Louisbourg, Inverness, Chéticamp, St. Peters, Port Hawkesbury, Mulgrave, Guysborough, Dominion and Canso. The area is 9,438 km2.

==Political geography==
In 2008, the Liberals won most of their support on Cape Breton Island, whereas the mainland portion of the riding voted Conservative with a few Liberal and NDP pockets The Conservatives and the NDP both won a small handful of polls on the island, and the Greens won a poll containing Judique. 

==History==
The riding of Bras d&#x27;Or was created in 1996 from parts of Cape Breton Highlands—Canso and Cape Breton—East Richmond ridings.

Bras d&#x27;Or was renamed &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or—Cape Breton&quot; in 1998. It was abolished in 2003. Most of its territory (except for the community of Sydney River) was incorporated into a new riding called &quot;Cape Breton—Canso&quot;, and it also added a portion of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough on the mainland.

Under the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding gained 9% of its new territory from Central Nova.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, this riding will largely be replaced by Cape Breton—Canso—Antigonish. It will gain the remainder of Antigonish County from Central Nova, and exchange territory with Sydney—Victoria, gaining Victoria, the remainder of Inverness and the rural western part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, and losing the urban part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality from Sydney Forks to Morien, including the Glace Bay area.

Her novel &quot;Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter&quot;, published in 1996, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Notable Book of the Year&quot; and a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; best-seller and has been published and translated into more than 14 languages. As described by Penelope Lively in a 1996 &quot;New York Times&quot; review: &quot;A Zimbabwean mother writes to her daughter, Zenzele, a Harvard student, telling the story of her life and thus reflecting the upheavals of her country and indeed her continent over the last 30 years or so.&quot; Maraire herself said at the time: &quot;Since I&#x27;ve written the book ... I’ve met a lot of young Africans who’ve told me it&#x27;s the first time they’ve read a book in which they recognize themselves, the generation of children who made the transition from pre-independence to the struggle for independence and the post-independence era, and the ensuing cynicism that inevitably followed. We remember apartheid, when we weren’t allowed to shop in certain stores. ... We’re lost between the traditional African culture and the modern culture. We don’t know how to incorporate them, and there are no role models. The world is so Western, and we want to retain our core identity.&quot;

==Personal life==
She now lives permanently in Zimbabwe. She is married to Allen Chiura, a urologist, also from Zimbabwe, and they have four children.

Most extant detail about Gui&#x27;s early life is derived from a short &quot;vita&quot; believed to have been written by his nephew, Pierre Gui, as part of a limited and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for Gui&#x27;s sainthood.

Gui was born circa 1261 or 1262 in the hamlet of Royères in the Limousin region in what today is France. He entered the Dominican monastery at Limoges as a novice in the early 1270s and was received into the order by the prior of Limoges, Stephen of Salanhac, on 16 September 1280. Gui then spent the following decade studying grammar, logic, philosophy (particularly the writings of Aristotle), and theology at Dominican &quot;studia&quot; (houses of study) across southern France, including the &quot;studium generale&quot; at Montpellier.

Following the completion of his education Gui undertook a number of administrative roles at Dominican houses across southern France: he was appointed sublector of Limoges in 1291, and prior of Albi in 1294, before going on to serve in the same capacity at Carcassonne in 1297, Castres in 1301, and Limoges in 1305.

Between 1316 and 1320 Gui acted as Procurator General of the Dominican Order, representing its interests within Pope John XXII&#x27;s court at Avignon, and during this time he also undertook diplomatic missions on behalf of the papacy. In January 1317, accompanied by the Franciscan Bertrand de la Tour, he was sent on a papal mission to Italy to instigate peace negotiations between the cities of northern Italy and Tuscany. Following their return to Avignon early in 1318, the two were sent to Flanders to mediate in the conflict between King Philip V of France and the Count of Flanders, Robert III. Both efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. Pierre Gui&#x27;s hagiography claims that while in Avignon, Gui also performed two miracles, curing the inquisitor of Barcelona, Arnaldus Borgueti&#x27;s insomnia and the friar Guillermus de Gardaga&#x27;s fever and dysentery.

Gui was made Bishop of Tui on 26 August 1323, although his inquisitorial activities meant he was largely absent from the see, and Bishop of Lodève in October 1324. He died in his episcopal residence at Lauroux castle on 30 December 1331, and following his funeral in Lodève Cathedral his body was transported to Limoges to be buried in the church of the Dominican monastery. However, his tomb was looted during the late-sixteenth-century Wars of Religion.

== Inquisitorial career ==
Between 1307 and 1323, at the behest of Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII, Gui served as the chief inquisitor of Toulouse, publicly styling himself as &#x27;Friar Bernard Gui, of the Order of Preachers, inquisitor of heretical depravity delegated to the kingdom of France by the apostolic authority&#x27;. He also assisted the inquisitors of Carcassonne, Geoffrey of Ablis and his successor Beaune, and the bishop of Pamiers, Jacques Fournier (later Pope Benedict XII). Gui&#x27;s inquisitorial work took place in the Languedoc, a region that remained a &quot;stronghold of heresy&quot;, in particular Catharism, despite the church&#x27;s repeated efforts in the area throughout the thirteenth century (such as the Albigensian Crusade of 1209–1229).

In this capacity Gui travelled the region, meeting with local clergy and officials, publicly preaching about the danger of heretical teachings, and inviting those guilty of heretical sins to voluntarily confess in exchange for light penance. He then interrogated those who had been accused of heretical activity by penitents but failed to come forward voluntarily, with the secular authorities enlisted to apprehend and, if necessary, torture the accused. (A papal bull of 1252 permitted torture in cases in which there were &quot;enough partial proofs to indicate that a full proof—a confession—was likely, and no other full proofs were available&quot;, although &quot;a confession made after or under torture had to be freely repeated the next day without torture or it would have been considered invalid&quot;.)

The inquisitor would then hold a &#x27;general sermon&#x27; (&quot;sermo generalis&quot;), assembling the local populace and publicly declaring the names of those judged guilty of the sin of heresy and their concomitant penances. Typical penalties included fasting, scourging, pilgrimage, the confiscation of property, or the wearing of large yellow crosses (with &quot;the arms of the crosses [to be] two-and-a-half fingers in breadth, two-and-a-half palms in height, and two palms in width&quot;) on the front and back of outer clothing. As canon law prohibited the clergy from spilling blood, those who refused to repent or who had relapsed into heresy were handed over to the secular authorities for punishment, typically execution by burning at the stake.

During his tenure Gui held eleven such &#x27;general sermons&#x27; in the cathedral of St Stephen in Toulouse and the cemetery of St John the Martyr in Pamiers, at which he judged 627 individuals guilty of heresy. A further nine individuals were also judged guilty at smaller events. In total, the tribunals headed by Gui convicted 636 individuals of 940 counts of heresy. In the nineteenth century the consensus among historians was that Gui had organised the burning of more than six hundred individuals. However, more recent research has determined that no more than 45 of the individuals convicted by Gui (approximately 7% of the total) were executed, while 307 were imprisoned, 143 ordered to wear crosses, and nine sent on compulsory pilgrimages.

On the basis of these statistics, and broader revision of the historiography of the medieval Inquisition, the modern historical consensus is that Gui&#x27;s inquisitorial career was characterised by moderation and leniency rather than cruelty or mercilessness; Janet Shirley states that Gui was &quot;more interested in penitence than punishment&quot; and generally sought to reconcile heretics to the Church. However, this interpretation has been challenged by James B. Given, who compares Gui&#x27;s rates of execution unfavourably to those of secular courts in France, England, and Italy. Furthermore, based on a close reading of Gui&#x27;s inquisitorial texts Karen Sullivan has argued that he &quot;rank[ed] among the more zealous of inquisitors&quot; in his thought, if not actions, claiming that Gui was motivated more by a desire to safeguard the wider church community from heresy than a concern for the salvation of the individual accused heretic.

In the early fourteenth century inquisitorial activities were also characterised by increased attention to unconverted Jews, and in 1319 Gui arranged for copies of the Talmud to be publicly burnt in Toulouse, a tactic commonly used by Dominican inquisitors. Gui was also charged with investigating the lepers&#x27; plot of 1321, an alleged well poisoning conspiracy by French lepers, Jews, and Muslims; and provided an account of the event in the &quot;Flores chronicorum&quot;.

Gui was succeeded as chief inquisitor of Toulouse by Pierre Brun in July 1324.

==Works==
Gui was one of the most prolific Latin authors of the Late Middle Ages, although he rarely wrote original works, preferring instead to compile and arrange existing texts, anecdotes, and records. He ordered the construction of a library at Limoges to accommodate over one hundred volumes; this was completed in 1306 and represented &quot;one of the earliest efforts in the West to build a room devoted especially to the preservation of books&quot;.

The Dominican monastery at Limoges had been a &quot;centre for historical study&quot; for over a century, and Gui compiled numerous works of history (referred to by Gui as &#x27;chronography&#x27;). These included the &quot;Flores chronicorum,&quot; a universal history from the birth of Christ to Gui&#x27;s death in 1331, and various local histories, including accounts of the saints of Limousin (&quot;Traité sur les saints du Limousin&quot;), the abbey of Limoges (&quot;Traité sur l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;abbaye de St. Augustin de Limoges&quot;), the priors of Grandmont (&quot;Chronique des prieurs de Grandmont&quot;) and L&#x27;Artige (&quot;Chronique des prieurs de l&#x27;Artige&quot;), and the bishops of Toulouse (&quot;Chronique des évêques de Toulouse&quot;) and Limoges (&quot;Catalogue des Évêques de Limoges&quot;). Additionally, he completed and significantly expanded the &quot;De Quator in quibus Deus Praedicatorum ordinem insignivit,&quot; a historical treatise on the Dominican Order begun in the 1270s by Stephen of Salanhac, and uncompleted at the time of the latter&#x27;s death in 1291. This was largely completed by 1311, although Gui continued to make minor additions until his death.

Gui also compiled the &quot;Chronique des rois de France&quot; in 1313&quot;,&quot; an illustrated genealogy of the kings of France. This included the &quot;Arbor genealogiae regum francorum,&quot; one of the earliest known examples of a family tree, which was widely reproduced. He also contributed his literary energies to the campaign for the canonisation of Thomas Aquinas, producing the hagiography &quot;Vita Sancti Thomae Aquinatis&quot; (based largely on extant works by William of Tocco) in 1318 and a catalogue of his works in 1320. He probably attended the canonisation ceremony in Avignon in July 1323.

However, Gui&#x27;s best-known works are those related to his inquisitorial career: &quot;Liber sententiarum,&quot; a comprehensive register of the sentences he delivered, and &quot;Practica inquisitionis heretice pravitatis&quot;, a comprehensive inquisitor&#x27;s manual. Inquisitors had no standardised or formal training, although they were often educated in theology or law, and practical guides to inquisitorial activities emerged as a distinct literary genre in the late twelfth century. Gui&#x27;s manual consisted of five books: the first three were formularies, providing templates to be used to deliver sentences during &#x27;general sermons&#x27;, and the fourth reproduced documents outlining and confirming the powers of the inquisitor (such as papal and conciliar legislation, and royal decrees). The fifth and most famous book provided descriptions of the beliefs and practices of heretics such as Cathars (referred to as &#x27;modern Manicheans&#x27;), Waldensians, Pseudo-Apostles, Beguines, and relapsed Jews, in addition to guidance for inquisitors on the best methods of interrogation for each group (including advocating torture if necessary). This was the first inquisitor&#x27;s manual to refer specifically to penalties for relapsed Jews.

The exact date of the text&#x27;s composition is unclear, but Janet Shirley suggests a completion date of early 1324 at the latest. The manual was based on Gui&#x27;s practical experience, but it also relied heavily on the writings of others for subjects in which he had little experience; for example, his description of the Waldensians includes passages lifted directly from Stephen of Bourbon&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus de diversis materiis predicabilibus&quot; and David of Augsburg&#x27;s &quot;De inquisitione hereticorum&quot;. Gui&#x27;s text was one of the most widely copied and read inquisitorial manuals during the medieval period, superseded only by the Catalan inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich&#x27;s fourteenth-century &quot;Directorium Inquisitorum,&quot; and heavily influenced later inquisitorial practice. Six manuscripts of the work survive, located in the archives of Toulouse, the Vatican Library, the British Museum, and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The first printed edition was published in 1886, when the text was translated to French by the Bishop of Beauvais, Marie-Jean-Celestin Douais.

==Popular culture==
A fictionalised Gui features as a secondary antagonist in the best-selling 1980 historical novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (&quot;Il nome della rosa&quot;) by Italian scholar and cultural critic Umberto Eco; the book has been translated into more than thirty languages and sold over fifty million copies. Gui was portrayed by American actor F. Murray Abraham in the 1986 film adaptation, and by British actor Rupert Everett in an eight-part 2019 television adaptation. As a consequence of the reassessment of the historical figure in the years subsequent to publication of the original novel, the character has been criticised by historians as historically inaccurate. Edward Peters has stated that the character is &quot;rather more sinister and notorious ... than [Gui] ever was historically&quot;, and John Aberth has branded the depiction of Gui as a &quot;pyromaniac madman&quot; as a &quot;horrible distortion of history&quot;; and have argued that the character resembles more closely the caricatures of Catholic inquisitors and prelates in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Gothic literature, such as Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796), than the historical Gui.

Due to his fictionalised portrayals in modern popular culture, most notably &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, he is &quot;perhaps the most famous of all medieval inquisitors&quot;, although among his contemporaries and modern historians he is more often noted for his accomplishments in administration, diplomacy, and historical writing.

<text>Francis Lederer (November 6, 1899 – May 25, 2000) was an Austro-Hungarian Empire-born American film and stage actor with a successful career, first in Europe, then in the United States. His original name was František (Franz) Lederer.

==Early years==
František (Franz) Lederer was born in Karlín, a working-class suburb of Prague, to a Jewish family. His mother was Rosa (Růžena) née Ornstein from Třebíč, his father Josef Lederer was a leather merchant. Until František was thirteen, his only recreation was wrestling. His parents separated when he was nine years old, and his brother Pavel died in World War I. His mother and younger brother Rudolf later moved to Los Angeles. Franz worked in a store that sold dry goods, and his first theatrical experience came when he was tasked with cleaning shelves in the background in a play while the main actors performed. He lost that role when he drew attention away from the stars to himself.

==Acting career==

===Europe===
Lederer started acting when he was young and was trained at the Academy of Music and Academy of Dramatic Art in Prague. After service in the Austrian-Hungarian Imperial Army in World War I, he made his stage debut as an apprentice with the New German Theater, a walk-on in the play &quot;Burning Heart&quot;. He toured Moravia and central Europe, making a name for himself as a matinee idol in theaters in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria and Germany. Notable among his performances was a turn as Romeo in Max Reinhardt&#x27;s staging of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Lederer worked with G.W. Pabst in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, starring Louise Brooks, and &quot;Atlantic&quot; (both 1929). He was also in &quot;The Wonderful Lies of Nina Petrovna&quot; in the same year. Lederer, billed as &quot;Franz&quot; at this time, made the transition from silent films to sound films.

===America===
In 1931, Lederer was in London to perform on stage in &quot;Volpone&quot; and the next year in &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot; by Dodie Smith, which he then performed on Broadway – using the name &quot;Francis&quot; – where it played for 210 performances in 1932 and 1933. He also performed the play in Los Angeles. As the rise of the Nazi movement and the institutionalization of anti-Semitism spread throughout Europe and the political situation there deteriorated, Lederer, who was Jewish, chose to remain in America rather than return home. He became a U.S. citizen in 1939.

Although he continued to play leads occasionally – notably as a playboy in Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s &quot;Midnight,&quot; with Claudette Colbert and John Barrymore in 1939 – in the late 1930s Lederer began to expand his character parts to include villains. Edward G. Robinson praised Lederer&#x27;s performance as a German American Bundist in &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; in 1939, and he earned plaudits for his portrayal of a fascist in &quot;The Man I Married&quot; (1940) with Joan Bennett. He also played Count Dracula in &quot;The Return of Dracula,&quot; in 1958.
Throughout his career, Lederer, who studied with Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio in New York City, continued to take theater acting seriously, and he performed on stage often in New York City and elsewhere. He appeared in stage productions of &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1937); &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; (1939); &quot;No Time for Comedy&quot; (1939), in which he replaced Laurence Olivier; &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; (1942); &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1944); &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (1950); &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; (1956); and &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1958).

In 1941, he took a break from making films in order to concentrate on his stage work. He returned to the silver screen in 1944, appearing in &quot;Voice in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot;, and went on to play in films such as Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; (1946) and &quot;Million Dollar Weekend&quot; (1948). He took another break from Hollywood in 1950, after making &quot;Surrender&quot; (1950), and returned in 1956 with &quot;Lisbon&quot; and the light comedy &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; with Olivia de Havilland. His final film appearance was in &quot;Terror Is a Man&quot; in 1959. 

During the 1950s, he served as honorary mayor of Canoga Park.

Lederer continued to appear on television over the next 10 years in such shows as &quot;Sally&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Blue Light&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;That Girl&quot;. His final television appearance was in a 1971 episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; called &quot;The Devil Is Not Mocked&quot;. In it, he reprised his role as Dracula from &quot;The Return of Dracula&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lederer, who became very wealthy, invested in real estate, especially in the Canoga Park community (which included West Hills, as defined in 1987). He was active in local and Los Angeles civic affairs, philanthropy and politics. He served as Recreation and Parks Commissioner for the city of Los Angeles and received awards for his efforts to beautify the city. He was the honorary mayor of Canoga Park for some time. He became involved with peace movements, taught acting, and was one of the founders of the American National Academy of Performing Arts in Los Angeles, and the International Academy of Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. In 2000, the Austrian government honored him with the Cross of Honor for Science and Arts, First Class.

Lederer was married three times. His first marriage was to Ada Nejedly, an opera singer. The year they wed remains undetermined, but records show that the couple divorced in 1928. In 1937, he married the actress Margo; they divorced three years later. Lederer&#x27;s final marriage was to Marion Eleanor Irvine, a native of Canada who lived most of her life in California. They wed there in 1941, and over the years he and Marion remained active in supporting various community projects and international humanitarian services, including the promotion of UNICEF. They remained together for nearly six decades, until his death in 2000.

==Lederer estate and residence==
In 1934, with the help of artisan builder John R. Litke, Lederer began the design and construction of his landmark residence and stables on the hilltop of a large rancho in the Simi Hills in Owensmouth, renamed Canoga Park, then West Hills. It is in the western San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California, at the west end of Sherman Way. The house blends Mediterranean Revival and Mission Revival styles. 

The residence and stables are both protected Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments. After the house was damaged by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the property was completely renovated. The estate is next to the very large 1845 Mexican land grant Rancho El Escorpión, which was Lederer&#x27;s southern rural viewshed and remained undeveloped open space until 1959. The home and grounds are still in the hands of the family.

<text>Marcus Joseph Ruslander (August 23, 1932 – March 30, 2023), better known as Mark Russell, was an American political satirist and comedian. He is best known for his series of bimonthly comedy specials on PBS television between 1975 and 2004. His routines were a mix of political stand-up humor covering current events and musical parodies in which he accompanied himself on his trademark American flag-themed piano.

==Early life==
Mark Russell was born Marcus Joseph Ruslander and grew up in Buffalo, New York, the son of Marie Elizabeth (Perry) and Martin Ruslander. He graduated from Canisius High School in Buffalo. After high school, his family briefly moved to Florida, then to Washington, D.C., where he enrolled at George Washington University, but stayed for only a month before joining the United States Marine Corps.

==Career==
Beginning in the early 1960s, he was a regular entertainer at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. and did his first PBS show in 1975. He was a regular on the 1977 CBS variety show &quot;The Starland Vocal Band Show&quot;. From 1979 to 1984, he was a correspondent on the NBC reality TV show &quot;Real People&quot;.

Russell&#x27;s song parodies employed melodies from old standards with new humorous lyrics pertinent to the subject matter. For example, in 1990, following the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, Russell did a parody song on his show to the tune of &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot;. (&quot;Pardon me, boys / Are you the cats who shot Ceauşescu?&quot;) Russell himself admitted that most of his jokes and songs are very topical and have &quot;a shelf life shorter than cottage cheese&quot;.

Russell&#x27;s humor was known for having skewered Democrats and Republicans, as well as third party, independent politicians and other prominent political (and sometimes nonpolitical) figures.

Russell was often asked the question &quot;Do you have any writers?&quot; His standard response was &quot;Oh, yes. I have 535 writers: One hundred in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives!&quot; When asked if his views on current events are too caustic, Russell replied, &quot;I follow the old newsman&#x27;s adage. As they say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t make the news. I just report it.&#x27; And in my case, I don&#x27;t even make the jokes. I just report them as they masquerade as news.&quot;

For several years, on the Sunday before Labor Day, Russell made annual appearances on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, which was hosted from 1991 to 2008 by Tim Russert, also a Canisius High graduate.

=== Parody issues ===
In 1994, Russell found himself unexpectedly allied with the rap group 2 Live Crew when the group was sued for copyright infringement for their parody of the song &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, where Russell and the members of 2 Live Crew argued that song parodies were protected under fair use. The Supreme Court agreed and ruled in favor of Russell and 2 Live Crew (&quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot;).

=== Retirement ===

In 2010, Russell announced his retirement from public performances and made his last public performance in July 2010 in Chautauqua, New York. He continued to write political humor for various venues and also published jokes on his own website.

By 2013, Russell began to tour and perform publicly again. His final performance was October 30, 2016, at the Carolina Theatre in Greensboro, North Carolina.

==In popular media==
Russell was portrayed by Mark McKinney in a 1996 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In the &quot;NewsRadio&quot; episode &quot;The Public Domain&quot; (1997), Phil Hartman&#x27;s character Bill McNeal is inspired by Russell to start a career as a singing political comedian.

In the earlier years of his run of PBS specials, an electronic version of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; was used in the opening sequence, which featured animated versions of an eagle, an elephant, and a donkey with Russell, dressed as Uncle Sam, being dragged by its tail marching across the screen. In later years, the opening sequence was a montage of a few of Russell&#x27;s monologues accompanied by a Dixieland jazz arrangement of &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. A similar arrangement of the song &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; was used for his entrance and as the closing theme.

Russell was referenced by Stan Smith&#x27;s college government professor in the episode &quot;Stan Moves to Chicago&quot; from &quot;American Dad!&quot;. The professor said they despise comedy, except for Russell&#x27;s piano routines.

Russell&#x27;s musical act was parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington&quot;.

==Death==
Russell died of complications from prostate cancer on March 30, 2023, at his home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 90.

==Awards==
On June 18, 1992 Mark Russell was the 4th recipient of The Lucy Award.

In 2004 Russell was the recipient of the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame Buffalo Bob Award, which is awarded annually to a Buffalo native who has achieved success in broadcasting outside of the Niagara Frontier area.

<text>Blumenau () is a city in Vale do Itajaí, Santa Catarina state, in the South Region of Brazil, from the state capital Florianópolis.

The city was founded by the German chemist and pharmacist Hermann Blumenau (1819–1899), who arrived on a boat via the Itajaí-Açu River accompanied by seventeen other Germans, and still celebrates its German heritage, including the second largest Oktoberfest in the world.

== History ==

The city was founded September 2, 1850, by Hermann Blumenau and seventeen other German immigrants. Later arrivals include biologist and early proponent of Darwinian Evolution, Fritz Müller.

The history of Blumenau is the result of the arrival of German immigrants who settled these fertile areas of the Atlantic Forest. Having an interest in the problems faced by European immigrants, in 1845 Hermann Blumenau reached an agreement with the Society for the Protection of German Emigrants to represent it and traveled to Brazil, aiming to create new German settlements and to check the situation of those that already existed. He traveled to Rio Grande do Sul, and then to Santa Catarina, where he visited the German colony of São Pedro de Alcântara. Aware of comments about the Itajaí Valley, he explored it in detail, in association with his compatriot Ferdinand Hackradt, since the aforementioned society was dissolved.

After taking certain precautions, Hermann Blumenau headed for Germany, to seek immigrants. On September 2, 1850, Hermann Blumenau returned to the chosen area with the seventeen initial immigrants. Despite the floods, clashes with wild animals and even with the indigenous peoples, due to the work of German immigrants willing to migrate continuously in greater numbers, the settlement prospered. Those first immigrants had a great support from the Brazilian government, who gave them land, housing, livestock, seeds, education and healthcare for a very low price and in many cases, entirely free.

On February 4, 1880, the municipality of Blumenau was created, composed of about 13,000 residents.

== Demographics ==

, Blumenau had an estimated population of 361,855 people, with an area of 519 km2 (200 sq mi). The main ethnic origin of the city inhabitants are German and Italian. The city displays many historical and cultural reminders of their heritage, such as houses and other buildings built in traditional German styles, statues, and memorials.

Blumenau, compared to other Brazilian cities, has a very high Human Development Index, 0.806 as of 2010.

== Geography ==
The city is located in a valley bisected by the Itajaí-Açu River, surrounded by hills with forests. The lower areas, including towers and tall buildings in the city center, constantly suffer from the threat of floods. Blumenau&#x27;s first recorded flood took place in the dawn on September 23, 1880. The worst took place in 1983 and 1984, when the city was completely isolated for weeks. Today, Blumenau is well-prepared against such threats, but many citizens prefer to live in higher areas spread into the nearby hills and plains to avoid flooding. However, this planning could not avoid even worse flooding in late November 2008, that killed over 100 and forced thousands to evacuate.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Blumenau is considered to be subtropical, a climate of transition between the predominantly tropical climate of Brazil and the predominantly temperate climate of Argentina. Under the Köppen climate classification, the city has a warm, humid subtropical climate.

Blumenau, like the entire state of Santa Catarina, is located south of the Tropic of Capricorn; therefore it is mild in the winter with temperatures averaging 16.6 °C (61 °F) and hot and humid in the summer with high temperatures averaging around 30 °C (87 °F). On July 23, 2013 the downtown of the city got a snow-rain mix and higher neighborhoods had accumulating snow.

== Economy ==
Blumenau&#x27;s main economic activity is still the textile industry, represented by large manufacturers such as Cia. Hering, Karsten and Teka.

Another area that draws attention is that of information technology; the city is the headquarters of the so-called Brazilian Silicon Valley, and many software leaders in its segment, some of whom were born in Blusoft and Instituto Gene startup incubators. Blumenau is also known as a location for the manufacturing of metallurgic, mechanical, and electrical equipment.

It has a strong economy, boosted by strong trade, service, and tourism events, with exhibitions of international importance, which are generally held in &quot;Vila Germânica&quot; (German Villa Park). Additionally, a new but rapidly expanding market is the production of craft beer, such as Eisenbahn.

=== Transport ===
Even though Blumenau is served by Quero-quero Airport, normally passengers use scheduled flights operated from Ministro Victor Konder International Airport, located in the nearby municipality of Navegantes. Gol Airlines, Azul Brazilian Airlines, and Latam offer for its passengers bus transfers between Navegantes and Blumenau at regular times.
During Oktoberfest, Azul operates flights at the local airport.

=== Tourism ===
The Blumenau&#x27;s Tourism Department maintains four tour routes covering different aspects of the city. Besides these, there&#x27;s the festival of the municipality. Also, the Oktoberfest of Blumenau, held every October, attracts over a million tourists every year. Originally begun as a fundraiser to alleviate the devastating floods of 1983 and 1984, the Blumenau Oktoberfest has become the second largest Oktoberfest after Munich.

<doc id="629760" wikidata="Q1332308" url="?curid=629760" title="Lanny McDonald">
<text>Lanny King McDonald (born February 16, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Colorado Rockies and Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played over 1,100 games during a 16-year career in which he scored 500 goals and over 1,000 points. His total of 66 goals in 1982–83 remains the Flames&#x27; franchise record for a single season. As of 2024 McDonald is the only player to be inducted in the Hockey Hall Of Fame for the Colorado Rockies.

McDonald was selected by the Maple Leafs as the fourth overall pick in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft and established himself as an offensive forward with three consecutive 40-goal seasons in Toronto in the mid-1970s. His trade to the Rockies in 1979 resulted in Toronto fans protesting the deal in front of Maple Leaf Gardens. He played parts of three seasons in Denver, before he was sent to Calgary in 1981 where he spent the remainder of his career. He co-captained the Flames to a Stanley Cup championship in his final season of 1988–89.

McDonald is among the most popular players in Flames history and his personality and bushy red moustache made him an iconic figure within the sport. McDonald won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and sportsmanship in 1983 and in 1988 was named the inaugural winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his leadership and humanitarian presence, in particular through his long association with the Special Olympics.

Internationally, McDonald represented Team Canada as a player on two occasions and in a management role three times. His assist created the tournament winning overtime goal of the inaugural 1976 Canada Cup, and he was director of player personnel of Canada&#x27;s 2004 World Championship winning team.

The Flames retired McDonald&#x27;s uniform number 9 in 1990. McDonald was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992, the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. In 2015, he was named chairman of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame, after serving nine years on the Hall&#x27;s selection committee. He was named to the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2022, and has been a trustee of the Stanley Cup since 2023.

==Early life==
McDonald was born February 16, 1953, in Hanna, Alberta. He is the youngest of four children after brother Lynn and sisters Donna and Dixie. His father, Lorne, tended the family farm near the hamlet of Craigmyle, outside Hanna. The young Lanny viewed his father as his hero, often following Lorne around helping with whatever chores he could. McDonald credits his father for teaching him the value of honesty and hard work. His mother, Phyllis, was a full-time teacher who was frequently involved with community events.

Learning to skate at the age of five, McDonald immediately developed a passion for hockey. He served as a stick boy, helping manage equipment, for his father&#x27;s community team and grew up listening to the famous Foster Hewitt radio broadcasts of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. McDonald shared his father&#x27;s passion for the Toronto Maple Leafs; he was given his middle name, King, after Maple Leafs&#x27; star King Clancy. He began playing organized hockey at the age of six and, despite both having full-time commitments, his parents drove him and Lynn to Hanna for their practices and games. McDonald recalled that half of his time in youth hockey was spent in Hanna, and the other half in the car. He completed high school while playing in Lethbridge, choosing to remain with his junior A team in 1970–71 rather than join the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) so that he could complete his diploma.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
McDonald began his junior career in 1969 with the Lethbridge Sugar Kings of the tier II Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He appeared in 34 games for the Sugar Kings as a 16-year-old, scoring two goals. The following season, 1970–71, he emerged as a leading scorer, recording 37 goals and 82 points in 45 games. He was voted the league&#x27;s most valuable player and named to the second All-Star team. Additionally, McDonald appeared in six WCHL games with the Calgary Centennials.

The Medicine Hat Tigers acquired McDonald&#x27;s playing rights in a trade during the 1970–71 WCHL season. He joined the team the following year, finishing eighth in league scoring with 114 points, including 50 goals. He improved to 62 goals and 139 points in 1972–73 to finish third overall in league scoring and was named to the WCHL All-Star team at forward. McDonald added 37 points in the playoffs as the Tigers won the league championship.

In McDonald&#x27;s draft year of 1973, the National Hockey League (NHL) was in competition with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) for talent. McDonald was considered a top junior prospect and was recruited by both leagues. The Vancouver Canucks had the third overall selection in the NHL draft and were interested in drafting him, but opted against it when McDonald made it clear he would likely go to the WHA rather than play with Vancouver. Instead, he went to the Toronto Maple Leafs with the fourth overall pick. In the WHA draft, he was selected 10th overall by the Cleveland Crusaders. McDonald chose to play in the NHL, signing a contract with the Maple Leafs that was considered to be among the richest in the league. The deal, worth between $175,000 and $200,000 per season, came as a result of the competition between the two leagues and McDonald found that some of the older players in Toronto resented him as a result.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
McDonald made his NHL debut with the Leafs on October 10, 1973, against the Buffalo Sabres. He assisted on two goals in the game, but also suffered a concussion immediately after the opening face off and required several stitches after landing on his head as a result of a check by Rick Martin. When McDonald returned to the ice sheet he put on his Winwell style helmet that he had worn as a Medicine Hat Tiger, which he wore for the rest of his career. All told he went helmetless for approximately 2.8 seconds as a professional. It was the only time in his career he did so, as he felt that his injury contributed to his early struggles in the NHL. McDonald scored his first NHL goal on October 17 against Michel Larocque of the Montreal Canadiens, but finished the season with only 14 goals and 30 points in 1973–74. His continued inability to score early in the 1974–75 season nearly resulted in a trade. Atlanta Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher sought to take advantage of the Maple Leafs&#x27; early disappointment in McDonald and agreed in principle to a trade for the young forward in exchange for Curt Bennett. However, McDonald scored three goals in his following two games causing Toronto to back out of the deal. McDonald recorded a modest improvement over his rookie campaign: 17 goals and 44 points.
The patience the Maple Leafs had shown McDonald in his first two seasons was rewarded in 1975–76 when he rediscovered his offensive touch, scoring 37 goals and adding 56 assists. Following the season, he earned an invite to the Canadian national team&#x27;s summer camp in advance of the 1976 Canada Cup. McDonald was named to the roster, and appeared in five of Team Canada&#x27;s seven games. He recorded two assists in the tournament, one of which came on Darryl Sittler&#x27;s overtime goal that clinched the inaugural Canada Cup championship.

A 43-goal season in 1976–77 earned McDonald several accolades. He was named to the Wales Conference team at the 1977 All-Star Game where he scored two goals in a 4–3 victory over the Campbell Conference. He was also named a second team All-Star at right wing following the season. It was the first of three consecutive 40-goal seasons for McDonald, and he finished in the top ten in NHL scoring in both 1977–78 and 1978–79. He appeared in his second All-Star Game in 1978 and played for the NHL All-Stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup against the Soviet national team.

The highlight of McDonald&#x27;s career in Toronto came in the 1978 Stanley Cup playoffs against the New York Islanders. The Maple Leafs were viewed as underdogs in the series against an Islanders team that was considered to be among the best in the league. Toronto overcame a 2–0 series deficit to force a seventh and deciding game. Playing despite breaking both his wrist and nose during the series, McDonald scored the overtime winning goal that eliminated the Islanders and allowed the Maple Leafs to advance to the league semi-finals for the first time in 11 years. Toronto was then eliminated by Montreal, who swept the series with four consecutive victories.

===Colorado Rockies===
Punch Imlach was named Toronto general manager prior to the 1979–80 season and immediately clashed with team captain Darryl Sittler. Imlach wanted to move Sittler to another team, but the player refused to waive his no-trade clause. Imlach responded by trading teammates friendly to Sittler instead. On December 28, 1979, Imlach dealt McDonald to the Colorado Rockies, along with Joel Quenneville, in exchange for Wilf Paiement and Pat Hickey. The deal came as a surprise even to Toronto&#x27;s head coach.

McDonald was devastated by the trade, particularly because he and his wife were expecting their second child and had just purchased a new house. In his 1987 autobiography, he argued that Imlach made the trade out of spite. McDonald had also come into conflict with Imlach while serving as the team&#x27;s representative of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) when the general manager refused to honour an increase in the per diem paid to each player. The trade outraged fans in Toronto, where McDonald was among the team&#x27;s most popular players. While fans picketed outside Maple Leaf Gardens in protest, McDonald told the media that he felt fortunate to have been traded away from the unsettled situation the Leafs were in and blamed Imlach for the team&#x27;s failures on the ice. Sittler resigned as the team&#x27;s captain following the trade.

Arriving in Colorado, McDonald found himself at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the fact that his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald permission to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35 goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.

Rumours circulated following the season that Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had told the media that he was attempting to reacquire McDonald. The Rockies disputed that any such negotiations had taken place and Ballard quickly apologized for the news story after Colorado threatened to file tampering charges against the Maple Leafs&#x27; owner. McDonald served as the Rockies&#x27; captain, and scored 35 goals and 81 points in 1980–81, his only full season with the team.

===Calgary Flames===
Stating that his team needed to add character and leadership, Cliff Fletcher finally completed a trade for McDonald seven years after his first attempt. McDonald was acquired by the Calgary Flames, along with a draft pick, in exchange for Bob MacMillan and Don Lever on November 25, 1981. The deal occurred one day after the last place Rockies lost to the Flames by a 9–2 score. Once the team&#x27;s plane landed in Winnipeg, McDonald was informed of the trade and told to return to Calgary. Angered at first, he viewed the deal as an insult, that the worst team in the NHL had rejected him.

McDonald also felt the pressure of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered earlier in the year with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal as a member of the Flames. He scored 34 goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.
The 1982–83 season was dominated by McDonald&#x27;s battle with Wayne Gretzky of the Edmonton Oilers for the league lead in goals. Amidst the best offensive season of his career, McDonald scored a hat trick against Pittsburgh to give him 47 goals at the mid-season break for the 1983 All-Star Game, a total that tied his career high. He was named to the starting lineup for the All-Star Game and was the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer at that point, two ahead of Gretzky. McDonald finished with 66 goals, five short of Gretzky&#x27;s 71. At that time, only Gretzky, Mike Bossy and Phil Esposito had ever scored more goals in one NHL season. McDonald was named to the second All-Star team for the second time in his career and was voted the winner of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, given to the player who &quot;best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey&quot;. His 66 goals remains a Flames&#x27; single season record.

Following the trade of Phil Russell in the summer of 1983, McDonald and Doug Risebrough were named co-captains for the 1983–84 season. They were joined by Jim Peplinski the following season. McDonald missed 15 games due to injuries which reduced his scoring to 33 goals and 66 points, but he played in his fourth All-Star Game. He scored the first Flames goal in the Olympic Saddledome, on the building&#x27;s opening night of October 15, 1983.

McDonald became the 21st player in NHL history to score 400 career goals, reaching the mark in a 7–4 loss in Los Angeles on December 21, 1983. He was initially credited with scoring the milestone goal in his previous game, against the Winnipeg Jets, but after reviewing a replay of the goal himself, McDonald asked the league to credit it to teammate Eddy Beers who had deflected his shot. His injury problems worsened in 1984–85 as he missed the start of the season with pulled muscles and was limited to just 43 games.

As the 1985–86 season approached, McDonald endured questions about whether he was reaching the point where age and injuries meant he could no longer be an effective NHL player. Hoping to prove himself, he set a goal of playing all 80 games for the Flames. He succeeded, and scored 28 goals and 71 points in the process, despite dislocating his thumb in the preseason and suffering minor knee and hip injuries during the course of the year. He later said it was a matter of pride to him not to miss a game. In the playoffs, McDonald was witness to one of the most infamous mistakes in NHL history. With the score tied at two in the seventh game of the Smythe Division final against Edmonton, McDonald chased Oilers&#x27; rookie Steve Smith around the Edmonton net. Smith attempted to pass the puck forward, but inadvertently hit the back of goaltender Grant Fuhr&#x27;s skate, deflecting the puck into his own net.

It turned out to be the winning goal for Calgary who eliminated Edmonton to clinch the Smythe Division championship. The victory over their provincial rivals also touched off a celebration amongst the fans, of which over 20,000 greeted the team with wild cheering when their plane landed at Calgary International Airport. A series win over the St. Louis Blues led McDonald and the Flames into their first Stanley Cup Finals, against Montreal. The series ended in disappointment: He watched from the bench as his teammates unsuccessfully attempted to tie the deciding game in the final minute and the Canadiens defeated the Flames in five games to win the Stanley Cup.

Two separate knee injuries limited McDonald in 1986–87. His total of 14 goals in 58 games was his fewest since his rookie season. He reached a milestone in the Flames&#x27; final game of the season, appearing in the 1,000th game of his career. Following a 10-goal campaign in 60 games in 1987–88, McDonald reached two additional major milestones in the 1988–89 season. On March 7, 1989, he scored the 1,000th point of his career with a wraparound goal from behind the net against Bob Essensa in a 9–5 victory against the Winnipeg Jets. Two weeks later, on March 21, he scored the 500th goal of his career on a nearly identical wraparound against Mark Fitzpatrick of the New York Islanders. It was the final regular season goal of McDonald&#x27;s career.
At 36 years old and approaching the end of his career, the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs was potentially his last chance at winning the Stanley Cup. The Flames defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup Finals rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was left out of the Flames&#x27; lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game. Crisp&#x27;s decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald stepped onto the ice after serving a penalty to join Håkan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up the right side of the ice. McDonald received the pass then shot the puck over Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy&#x27;s glove to give the Flames a 2–1 lead. Doug Gilmour added two goals, and Calgary won the game 4–2 to earn the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship. League president John Ziegler presented the trophy to McDonald, co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate Tim Hunter. Wearing the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; for the game, McDonald was the first member of the Flames to carry the trophy as the team paraded it around the Forum in celebration.

==Management career==
McDonald announced his retirement as a player on August 28, 1989, stating in a press conference that he made the determination before the 1988–89 season began that it would be his last. He also revealed that he had received an offer from another, unnamed, team to play in 1989–90 but felt that it was the right time to end his career. The Flames made McDonald their vice president in charge of corporate and community affairs. He chose the corporate position partly due to a fascination with the business world, and partly to remain close to his family as a role in hockey operations would have necessitated more travel. His interest in business grew following his trade to Calgary as he was featured in numerous commercials and signed endorsements throughout southern Alberta. He had also previously served as a vice president of the NHLPA in the early 1980s. McDonald changed roles in 1992 as he was named the team&#x27;s Vice President of Marketing. After serving four years in that position, McDonald became the Vice President of Corporate Development in 1996.

McDonald was part of a committee tasked with hiring a new management team in June 2000. The media speculated that after several years in a corporate position, he hoped to land a role as a vice president within hockey operations. He received no such role, and two months after the hiring of Craig Button as executive vice president and general manager of the Flames, McDonald announced he was leaving the organization. McDonald denied claims from team sources that he was upset at not gaining a new role when Button was hired. He stated that after &quot;nineteen great years here in one organization&quot;, it was the right time to retire. He retained a small role in the organization, serving as a board member of the Saddledome Foundation.

Ken King, newly hired president of the Flames, lured McDonald back into the organization a year later by naming him an executive assistant to hockey operations. McDonald held the position until 2003. He also served in hockey operations roles with Hockey Canada. McDonald was the general manager of Team Canada for the 2001 and 2002 World Championships. He returned in 2004 in a role as director of player personnel of Canada&#x27;s gold medal-winning squad.

==Playing style==

McDonald was known primarily as an offensive player with a hard shot. His wrist shot was considered to be effective, and his scoring exploits in junior hockey earned him the nickname &quot;Machine-Gun Lanny&quot;. Red Kelly, McDonald&#x27;s coach in his first NHL seasons, recalled that he was impressed with his young player&#x27;s skill handling the puck and defended McDonald against critics who wanted him moved out of Toronto due to his early struggles. In his NHL career, McDonald led his team in goal scoring six times: 1976–77, 1977–78 and 1978–79 with Toronto, 1980–81 with Colorado, and 1981–82 and 1982–83 in Calgary. He was also a physical player, willing to play a hard-hitting style in the corners.

As age and injuries took their toll, McDonald&#x27;s role with the Flames changed. His playing time decreased in his later years as he was no longer counted on to be the team&#x27;s primary offensive threat. Often left out of the lineup in his final season, McDonald was expected to provide a boost to the team when he drew into the lineup. He was counted on to provide a veteran presence and to act as a mentor for the team&#x27;s younger players.

==Legacy==
The Flames arrived in Calgary after relocating from Atlanta for the 1980–81 season. The organization entered a transitional phase, as many players used to the warm weather and relaxed atmosphere of Atlanta were unable or unwilling to adapt to the higher expectations fans in Calgary placed on them. David Poile, then Flames assistant general manager, stated that the team had an identity crisis as a result. It was in this atmosphere that general manager Cliff Fletcher made the trade for McDonald on November 25, 1981, claiming that McDonald added two characteristics the Flames lacked: character and leadership.

McDonald&#x27;s arrival in Calgary was considered a turning point for the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s. Poile argued that it signalled the true beginning of the team in its new market: &quot;The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise. It gave us that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor.&quot; Columnist and co-author of McDonald&#x27;s autobiography, Steve Simmons, agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining a greater appreciation of both the game and himself. McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played, as well as with the media – he was named Colorado&#x27;s athlete of the year in 1980 by the state&#x27;s sportswriters.

Renowned for his leadership ability, McDonald cultivated the respect of the team&#x27;s younger players. He came into the NHL at a time when the battle with the rival WHA for talent led to rookies signing for far more money than the previous generation of players commanded. Consequently, McDonald faced the resentment of several of Toronto&#x27;s veteran players and resolved to show greater respect to those that followed him. His efforts left a lasting impression on his peers; among them was Tiger Williams who called McDonald &quot;a great ambassador&quot; for the NHL.

The Flames made McDonald the first player in franchise history to have his jersey retired when they raised his number 9 to the rafters of the Olympic Saddledome in a ceremony on March 17, 1990. As part of its 1992 class, he was also the first former Flame to gain induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame. One year later he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. McDonald&#x27;s image endured well into retirement; in 2008, he was the only athlete named in a list of Alberta&#x27;s ten greatest citizens compiled by the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;. In 2017, McDonald was awarded the Order of Sport, marking induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

McDonald was named to the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2022. He has been a Stanley Cup trustee since August 3, 2023.

==Personal life==

McDonald met his wife Ardell while playing junior hockey for the Medicine Hat Tigers. They were married in 1975, and have four children: daughters Andra and Leah, and sons Barrett and Graham. The family settled in Calgary after McDonald&#x27;s trade to the Flames. They also maintain a summer home in Montana, where the family has invested in restaurants and a craft brewery in the community of Lakeside. Co-owned by Andra, the brewery considers McDonald its inspiration, and produces &quot;Old &#x27;Stache Porter&quot; in his honour.

His giant, walrus-style moustache is McDonald&#x27;s most defining physical characteristic and helped him become an iconic figure in the sport. He developed it in 1974, spending the summer seeing what kind of beard he could grow. Knowing that the Maple Leafs did not allow players to maintain beards at the time, he settled on what he described as a &quot;normal moustache&quot; once he returned to Toronto. Some time later, he was inspired by baseball player Sparky Lyle&#x27;s moustache and chose to grow one in a similar style. It became a symbol for the Flames as some fans took to wearing fake red moustaches during playoff runs. Razor manufacturers offered endorsements if he would shave it, which he refused.
Among his charitable and humanitarian efforts, McDonald is best known for his participation with the Special Olympics. He first became involved with the organization in 1974 when the Maple Leafs asked him to represent the team at the Special Olympics Summer Games. The event began a decades long association for McDonald. He was the honorary coach of the 1986 Special Olympics Summer Games in Calgary, and served as a head coach for the Canadian Special Olympics floor hockey team. In 1988, McDonald&#x27;s contributions to the Special Olympics as a coach and co-chairman of the organization&#x27;s fundraising efforts, as well as his work with the Alberta Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals, were recognized by the NHL as he was named the inaugural recipient of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The award is given to the hockey player who best exemplifies leadership on the ice with humanitarian contributions off of it. McDonald was previously honoured by the Flames as the first winner of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 1987, which he won again in 1989.

McDonald&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lanny&quot;, co-written by Steve Simmons, was published in 1987. A Canadian best-seller, it was an unexpected success for publisher McGraw-Hill. The book sold 10,000 copies in its first couple months of publication, for which the publisher made a donation of $10,000 to the Special Olympics. In 2008, McDonald was given an honorary doctorate from the University of Calgary.

On February 4, 2024, while returning home from the 2024 NHL All-Star festivities, McDonald suffered a heart attack and went into cardiac arrest at the Calgary International Airport. Rajdeep Cheema noticed a man experiencing a medical emergency at the Calgary International Airport, and immediately began performing CPR. Two off-duty nurses, Sheri Warkentin and Denise Geck, had just gotten off an incoming flight and quickly took over performing CPR, allowing Rajdeep to find a nearby AED. A CPS member (Jose Cives) quickly rushed over, and together, the four of them tirelessly worked to re-establish the man’s heart rhythm for approximately 15 minutes, alternating between CPR and using the AED. He was subsequently hospitalized for two weeks, during which he underwent quadruple bypass surgery and received a pacemaker.

<doc id="629761" wikidata="Q1492395" url="?curid=629761" title="Cranchiidae">
<text>The family Cranchiidae comprises the approximately 60 species of glass squid, also known as cockatoo squid, cranchiid, cranch squid, or bathyscaphoid squid. Cranchiid squid occur in surface and midwater depths of open oceans around the world. They range in mantle length from to over , in the case of the colossal squid. The common name, glass squid, derives from the transparent nature of most species. Cranchiid squid spend much of their lives in partially sunlit shallow waters, where their transparency provides camouflage. They are characterised by a swollen body and short arms, which bear two rows of suckers or hooks. The third arm pair is often enlarged. Many species are bioluminescent organisms and possess light organs on the undersides of their eyes, used to cancel their shadows. Eye morphology varies widely, ranging from large and circular to telescopic and stalked. A large, fluid-filled chamber containing ammonia solution is used to aid buoyancy. This buoyancy system is unique to the family and is the source of their common name &quot;bathyscaphoid squid&quot;, after their resemblance to a bathyscaphe. Often the only organ that is visible through the transparent tissues is a cigar-shaped digestive gland, which is the cephalopod equivalent of a mammalian liver. This is usually held in a vertical position to reduce its silhouette and a light organ is sometimes present on the lower tip to further minimise its appearance in the water.

Like most squid, the juveniles of cranchiid squid live in surface waters, descending to deeper waters as they mature. Some species live over 2 km below sea level. The body shape of many species changes drastically between growth stages, and many young examples could be confused for different species altogether.

The largest squid in the family Cranchiidae is the colossal squid.

Cranchiid squid represent no interest to commercial fisheries.

The family is named for John Cranch.

==Genera==
The family contains two subfamilies (both established by Georg Johann Pfeffer) and about 15 genera:
*Subfamily Cranchiinae
**Genus &quot;Cranchia&quot;
**Genus &quot;Leachia&quot;
**Genus &quot;Liocranchia&quot;
*Subfamily Taoniinae
**Genus &quot;Bathothauma&quot;

<text>Wendel Lee Clark (born October 25, 1966) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. His professional career lasted from 1985 until 2000, during which time he played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Quebec Nordiques, New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning, Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks. He was chosen first overall in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft by the Maple Leafs, the team he played with on three occasions, captaining the team from 1991 to 1994. Clark is a fan favourite in Toronto, continuing to represent the Maple Leafs at public events.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
A star junior hockey defenceman with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League, Clark was a member of Canada&#x27;s gold medal-winning team at the 1985 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (1985–1994)===
Clark was converted to forward after he was selected first overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. Clark was known for his physical play and his offensive mind combined with scoring prowess. As tough as Clark was, his scoring touch and offensive ability was equal to his on-ice toughness. Clark&#x27;s 227 PIM in his rookie season was the 1985–86 Toronto Maple Leafs team-high, along with 34 goals which also led the team. After his rookie season, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team and finished third in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy.

Clark was named captain of the team for the 1991–92 season. During the 1992–93 season, Clark&#x27;s second year captaining the team, the Leafs set team records in wins (44) and points (99) and also made the playoffs for the first time in three years. The Leafs had a memorable run to the Campbell Conference Finals, but after leading the best-of-seven series three games to two coming within one game of advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals, they lost to the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings, who were coached by Clark&#x27;s cousin, Barry Melrose. 
Two career-defining moments happened in this series for Clark: his toe-to-toe fight in Game 1 of the series with enforcer Marty McSorley in retribution for a big hit McSorley made on Leafs star Doug Gilmour, and his hat-trick in Game Six of the seven-game series. &quot;That series was probably the most excitement I saw around here,&quot; proclaimed Clark, who had a legendary series performance with 20 points (10 goals and 10 assists) in his 21 games during the &#x27;93 playoffs. &quot;It was the furthest the Leafs had advanced in a long time, the team was coming together at the right time and everybody was doing their jobs.&quot;

Clark managed a career-high 46 goals in 64 games for the Leafs during the 1993–94 season, playing on a line with Dave Andreychuk and Doug Gilmour. In the playoffs, the Leafs made a second consecutive trip to the Conference Finals but fell 4–1 to the Vancouver Canucks, who were coached by future Leafs coach Pat Quinn.

===Trades, return to Toronto and later years (1994–2000)===
In June 1994, with his value at an all-time high, Clark was traded to the Quebec Nordiques in a multi-player deal that notably involved a young Mats Sundin. He was succeeded as Maple Leafs captain by Gilmour. Clark played the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season in Quebec.

After the Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche, Clark became embroiled in a contract dispute with the team. As a result, shortly before the beginning of the 1995–96 campaign, he was sent to the New York Islanders in a three-way trade that brought Claude Lemieux to Colorado and Steve Thomas to the New Jersey Devils. Clark played 58 games with the Islanders but finished the season back in Toronto.

The Islanders received a first-round pick from the Leafs (4th overall in 1997) which turned out to be Roberto Luongo.

In 1998 Clark signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he earned a spot on the North American All-Star team and went on to score 28 goals in 65 games. Despite his success in Tampa Bay, he was dealt at the trade deadline to the Detroit Red Wings, where he finished the 1998–99 season. Clark signed with the Chicago Blackhawks later in 1999 but only appeared in 13 games with the team.

Upon returning to the Leafs in 2000, after being benched by the Blackhawks, Clark was not particularly effective for the remainder of the regular season, but he found his form for the Leafs&#x27; playoff run. Leaf fans gave their former captain a 90-second standing ovation after Clark barreled into the New Jersey Devils zone and hit the post in Game 1. During Game 4, Clark assisted on the game-winning goal that gave the Leafs a 2–1 victory and tied the series with the Devils.

==Post-retirement==
Clark is now employed by the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club as a community ambassador and public relations. He can be seen at virtually all Leaf home games, usually with his wife Denise and children. The Toronto Maple Leafs honoured the former captain by raising his legendary number 17 to the rafters on November 22, 2008, at the Air Canada Centre. The number was officially retired by the team on October 15, 2016, during a home pre-game ceremony in which 17 players representing 11 sweater numbers were similarly honoured. Prior to the Leafs&#x27; Hockey Day in Canada game against the Ottawa Senators on Saturday, February 18, 2017, it was announced that statues of iconic Leafs Charlie Conacher, Red Kelly, Frank Mahovlich and Wendel would be added to the Leafs&#x27; Legends Row, located outside the Air Canada Centre, as part of the ongoing Maple Leafs&#x27; Centennial Anniversary.

He owns Wendel Clark&#x27;s Classic Grill and Sports Lounge, with four restaurants in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Brampton, Ontario; Oshawa, Ontario; and Burlington, Ontario. He resides in King City.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
Clark&#x27;s first cousin is ex-NHLer and ESPN commentator Barry Melrose; he is also a cousin of former Detroit Red Wing and Saskatoon Blades player Joe Kocur. 

Clark&#x27;s younger brother Kerry Clark was also a professional hockey player; he was a career minor leaguer who is in the top 60 in minor league history in penalty minutes with 2812. Clark&#x27;s other brother, Donn Clark, is best known for being the head coach of the Prince Albert Raiders and the Saskatoon Blades.

Clark&#x27;s son, Kody, played three seasons for the Ottawa 67&#x27;s of the Ontario Hockey League beginning in 2016. Kody was selected 47th overall in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals, and played three seasons for the Hershey Bears.

==In popular culture==
Though it was released very early in his career, arguably before he became well known as a player, Clark was celebrated by the Canadian band The Rheostatics in the song &quot;The Ballad of Wendel Clark Parts I &amp; II&quot; on their debut album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

==Awards==
* WHL East First All-Star Team – 1985
* Selected to two NHL All-Star Games: 1986 and 1999
* NHL All-Rookie Team – 1986
* Inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>Franklin Henry Little (1879 – August 1, 1917), commonly known as Frank Little, was an American labor leader who was murdered in Butte, Montana. No one was apprehended or prosecuted for Little&#x27;s murder. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, organizing miners, lumberjacks, and oil field workers. He was a member of the union&#x27;s Executive Board when he was murdered and lynched.

==Early life==
According to the 1880 U.S. census, Franklin Henry Little was born in Illinois about 1878 to Dr. Walter R. and Almira Hays Little. Dr. Walter Little attended medical school in Keokuk, Lee County, Iowa between the years 1874 and 1878. In 1889 he left behind his medical practices in Missouri in the pursuit of a new home for his family, finally settling in Oklahoma, where the family became homesteaders in the 1889 Oklahoma Land Rush. The family later suffered drought and penurious conditions after the Panic of 1893. After Dr. Walter Little&#x27;s death in 1899, Frank Little followed his miner brother, Walter Frederick Little, to California, where he too became a miner. In 1903, Frank departed his brother and sister-in-law, Emma Harper Little, in California for Bisbee, Arizona. There he worked as a miner before becoming an organizer for the Western Federation of Miners in Clifton, Arizona. In 1905 Frank Little joined the Industrial Workers of the World.   

==Industrial Workers of the World==
Frank Little was involved in organizing lumberjacks, metal miners, migrant farm workers, and oil field workers into industrial unions, often as part of free speech campaigns. He pioneered the passive resistance tactics used by the Freedom Riders during the Civil Rights Movement. Frank Little first took part in the 1909 Missoula, Montana free speech fight along with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, helping organize lumber workers who suffered at the hands of logging company managers complicit with &quot;sharks,&quot; or employment agencies who tricked workingmen out of their hard-earned money. Next Frank Little took part in the Spokane, Washington free speech fight, where he was sentenced to thirty days in prison for reading the Declaration of Independence. He suffered in Spokane&#x27;s frigid Franklin School after refusing to work on the city rock pile.

Along with his organizer brother Walter Frederick Little and sister-in-law Emma Harper, Frank took part in free speech fights among workers in Fresno, California in 1910 and 1911. On one occasion, he was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment for reading the Declaration of Independence on a street corner. Little and several hundred workers were arrested for violating a city ordinance, congregating on city streets to publicly speak. In response, Frank said he expected a large arrival of Russians, Japanese, Germans, and Chinese to join the IWW. Many more workers belonging to the Industrial Workers of the World union came to the city and struck in support after Frank calls them to solidarity on May 10 and August 27, 1910. Frank and his brother would wait until after harvest to take the fight to the streets of Fresno. In response to the free speech fights sixty-six new IWW locals formed. Eventually, Little successfully organized unskilled fruit workers in the San Joaquin Valley of California, a precursor to Cesar Chavez&#x27;s work. He also led free speech efforts in Kansas City, Missouri; Webb City, Missouri; and Peoria, Illinois.

In August 1913, Little and fellow Industrial Workers of the World union organizer James P. Cannon arrived in Duluth, Minnesota, to support the strike of ore-dock workers against the Great Northern Railway over dangerous working conditions. In the course of the strike he was kidnapped, held at gunpoint outside of the city, and dramatically rescued by union supporters.

In 1914, Little was elected a member of the Industrial Workers of the World&#x27;s General Executive Board. Two years later he returned to the Great Lakes Region, where he organized Superior, Wisconsin, dock workers in a strike for better safety conditions and wages. There he was kidnapped, severely beaten, and mock hanged.  

== Anti-war activism ==
Little was a strong opponent of capitalism after witnessing many late 19th and early 20th-century American businessmen use what he viewed as unscrupulous methods to get rich. As a result, he also opposed World War I, which many believed to be a &quot;rich man&#x27;s war and a poor man&#x27;s fight.&quot; While General Secretary-Treasurer William Haywood and members of the General Executive Board shared Little&#x27;s opinions about the war, they disagreed about whether to create anti-war agitation. When the United States joined the war in April 1917, Ralph Chaplin, the editor of the Industrial Workers of the World&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Solidarity&quot;, claimed that opposing the draft would destroy the union through government repression. Other Board members argued that organized labor would not have the power to stop the war until more workers were organized, and the union should continue to focus on organizing workers at the point of production, even if their actions might incidentally impede the war effort.

Little refused to back down on this issue and argued that &quot;...the IWW is opposed to all wars, and we must use all our power to prevent the workers from joining the army.&quot; He planned to go to Butte, Montana, to support union organizing after the Speculator Mine Disaster on June 8, 1917, where 168 men died. A fire began in the Granite Mountain shaft of the Spectacular Mine owned by North Butte Mining Company. Sealed bulkheads prevented men from escaping toxic fumes in the various levels of the mine. Afterwards, mine workers formed a new union, Metal Mine Workers&#x27; Union, and were joined in a strike by other trades.

Prior to Little&#x27;s arrival in Butte, on July 12, 1917, about 1200 striking mine workers in Arizona were rounded up and deported to New Mexico. Xenophobia, especially against German Americans, pervaded the nation. Mine operators used the volatile atmosphere as an excuse to deport striking miners, &quot;undesirables&quot; or immigrants that were perceived to be a threat. Little had broken his ankle and was not part of the Bisbee Deportation but visited organizers in Miami, Arizona, before leaving for Butte, Montana. He also suffered from a double hernia after being jumped and kicked in El Paso, Texas. By some accounts, he carried 135 pounds on his 5&#x27;11&quot; frame and was in terrible pain.

The day before the Bisbee deportation, Frank purchased a seat in the Pullman Berth to Salt Lake City. He was unable to travel by side-door Pullman anymore because of his current physical state. He was still recovering from his hernias as well as a broken ankle. On the day he left for Butte, Frank contacted Arizona&#x27;s Governor Campbell about his protest to the Bisbee deportation. Frank wrote, &quot;If you, as governor, cannot uphold the law, we will take same into our own hands. Will you act or must we?&quot;

In this physical condition, on July 18, 1917, Little arrived in Butte to help organize the copper miners&#x27; union and lead the miners&#x27; strike against Anaconda Mining Company for better safety conditions and higher wages, abolition of the contract system, and removal of the &quot;rustling card.&quot; The striking workers had been subject to attack by a &quot;home guard&quot; organized by the company, and newspapers worked to undermine public support for the workers. Little created a picket line at the mines, persuaded women to join the lines, and ultimately encouraged the other trades to join the strike. During this period, he also spoke out against US involvement in the war, calling soldiers serving in Europe &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s scabs in uniform.&quot; This raised the ire of the press and Anaconda Mining Company officials, who did not want the copper output affected.

== Lynching ==
In the early hours of August 1, 1917, six masked men broke into Nora Byrne&#x27;s Steel Block boardinghouse where Frank Little was staying. The men initially kicked in the wrong door in the boardinghouse, and when confronted by Byrne claimed to be (law) officers. Little was beaten in his room and abducted while still in his underwear. He was bundled into a car which sped away.

Little was later tied to the car&#x27;s rear bumper and dragged over the granite blocks of the street. Photographs of his body show that his knee-caps had possibly been scraped off. Little was taken to Milwaukee Bridge at the edge of town where he was then hanged from a railroad trestle. The coroner found that Little died of asphyxiation. It was also found that his skull had been fractured by a blow to the back of the head caused by a rifle or gun butt. A note with the words &quot;First and last warning&quot; was pinned to his thigh, referring to earlier vigilantes giving people three warnings to leave town. The note also included the numbers 3-7-77 (a sign of Vigilantes active in the 19th century in Virginia City, Montana, which some people thought referred to grave measurements), and the initials of other union leaders, suggesting they were next to be killed. This was the first hanging of a militant labor leader in America since Haymarket, which occurred on May 4, 1886.

The attorney for the Metal Mine Workers said after Little&#x27;s murder that the union had received warnings about Joe Shannon, Tom Campbell, and another man.

Although no one was apprehended or prosecuted for Little&#x27;s lynching, a number of people have speculated about his murder. The author Dashiell Hammett was working as a strikebreaker in Butte for Pinkerton&#x27;s, and (allegedly) turned down an offer of $5,000 to assassinate Little. Hammett later made use of his experiences in Butte to write &quot;Red Harvest&quot;. Rory Carroll writes, &quot;In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett&#x27;s companion, said he told her about the offer to murder Little. &#x27;Through the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe … that it was a kind of key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.&#x27;&quot; William Nolan, one of Hammett&#x27;s biographers, thinks that &quot;the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be that kind of person, and that he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.&quot;

Union leaders who had seen Little&#x27;s body at the time insisted that one of the murderers was Billy Oates, a notorious hired thug employed by Anaconda. The rationale for Oates&#x27; involvement was a small hole at the back of Little&#x27;s head that had been &quot;inflicted by the steel hook used by Oates on the stub of his amputated right arm.&quot;

Over the next nine years two more men were named as possibly being involved in Little&#x27;s lynching. At the time of the 1918 Industrial Workers of the World conspiracy trial in Chicago, the union&#x27;s lawyers questioned why Ed Morrissey, who had been Butte&#x27;s chief of detectives at the time of the murder, had taken a twenty-day leave of absence on the day following the killing. It was alleged at the trial that Morrissey had scratches on his face. The autopsy of Little&#x27;s body had found that he had tried to fight off his assailants and that he had someone&#x27;s skin under his fingernails. In 1926, William F. Dunne identified Peter Prlja as one of the &quot;death squad.&quot; Prlja was at the time a motorcycle officer in the Butte police department and like Oates had worked as a security guard for Anaconda.

An estimated 10,000 workers lined the route of Frank Little&#x27;s funeral procession, which was followed by 3,500 more persons. The funeral is still the largest ever in Butte history. He was buried in Butte&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery. His grave marker reads &quot;Slain by capitalist interests for organizing and inspiring his fellow men.&quot;

== Effects of Little&#x27;s Lynching ==
Little&#x27;s assassination gained national attention and was widely spread throughout the community of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). In the wake of the news, reporters awaited on Bill Haywood, the founding member of the IWW, and what he had to say regarding the lynching. Haywood wrote an editorial for Solidarity the same day as Frank&#x27;s death, stating that Frank was murdered for taking part in the strike at Butte, Montana. Haywood goes on to say, &quot;The tragic, brutal death of Frank Little will unite the working forces of this country against the masters of bread. He has not died in vain, and with his blood will be written the abolition of the wage system.&quot; Bill Haywood used Little&#x27;s death as an advancement for the IWW to gain popularity and strengthen the loyalty amongst members. In addition, Bill Haywood felt Frank&#x27;s body should be buried in Butte, where his grave would promote positive propaganda for the IWW and be safe from mobs. For the time following Franks death, IWW members shouted &quot;We never forget!&quot; as a rally cry in honor of Little.

<text>Arthur Mathews is an Irish comedy writer and actor who, often with writing partners such as Graham Linehan, Paul Woodfull and Matt Berry, has either written or contributed to television comedies, such as &quot;Father Ted, Big Train,&quot; and &quot;Toast of London&quot; and &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;.

==Early life==

Mathews attended Castleknock College, a private school run by Vincentian priests. He then graduated from the Dublin Institute of Technology with a degree in graphic design. He played drums in spoof U2 tribute act &quot;The Joshua Trio&quot; with Paul Woodfull, with whom he would later work on &quot;I, Keano&quot;. He worked as art editor for &quot;Hot Press&quot;, leaving in 1991 to move to London.

==Writing career==

=== Television===
Mathews has contributed to many sketch shows, including &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;, &quot;The All New Alexei Sayle Show&quot; and the &quot;Ted &amp; Ralph&quot; segments of &quot;The Fast Show&quot;.

However, it was with &quot;Father Ted&quot; (three series, 1995–1998) that he and Graham Linehan made their biggest impression. It debuted on Channel 4. The writing partnership had previously co-written the comedy &quot;Paris&quot; (one series, 1994), also for Channel 4.

Both Linehan and Mathews worked on the first series of sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot;, but Linehan dropped out for the second series. Mathews has also contributed to other British comedies such as &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Black Books&quot; and later &quot;Toast of London&quot;. He later contributed sketches for Kevin Eldon, including the Amish Sex Pistols.

In 1999, Linehan and Mathews created the sixties-set sitcom &quot;Hippies&quot;, but the six-part series (which starred Simon Pegg and Sally Phillips) was written by Mathews alone.

In late 2003, the two men were named one of the 50 funniest acts to work in television by &quot;The Observer&quot;.

===Theatre===
In 2005, Mathews, with Michael Nugent and Paul Woodfull, co-wrote &quot;I, Keano&quot;, a comedy musical play about footballer Roy Keane leaving the Republic of Ireland national football team before the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

It is presented as a mock-epic melodrama about an ancient Roman legion preparing for war. In its first two years, over half a million people watched it, generating €10m ($13m) in ticket sales. In January 2008, it began its fourth year of performances. He confirmed in 2018 that he and Linehan were working together on a Father Ted musical.

==Television appearances==
Linehan and Mathews appeared in the sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as two Irish television producers considering hiring Alan Partridge as a presenter. Mathews later starred in &quot;I Am Not An Animal&quot;, an animated comedy series about talking animals written by Peter Baynham.

Matthews also made four appearances on Father Ted: as Father Billy Kerrigan in Series 1, as one half of the picnic couple and as Father Ben in Series 2, and as Father Clarke in Series 3.

<doc id="629769" wikidata="Q5632527" url="?curid=629769" title="HMS Gabbard (D47)">
<text>HMS &quot;Gabbard&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named in honour of the Battle of the Gabbard, which occurred in 1653, and which resulted in an English victory over the Dutch Fleet. &quot;Gabbard&quot; was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited on the Tyne. She was laid down on 2 February 1944, launched on 16 March 1945 and completed on 10 December 1946.

==Royal Navy service==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Gabbard&quot; joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet based in the UK. In 1947, &quot;Gabbard&quot;, while on a visit to Malmö, Sweden, narrowly avoided collision with the ferry &quot;Malmohus&quot; out of Aarhus, Denmark. The harbour at Malmö is in the form of a capital &#x27;E&#x27; the central segment being a stone jetty. The destroyer , entered the harbour first and tied up with the stone jetty on her port bow. She was followed by &quot;Gabbard&quot;. In order to depart, &quot;Gabbard&quot; swung round on her bow cable and started to steam ahead. At the same time the ferry entered the harbour. To avoid a collision, &quot;Gabbard&quot; went astern at speed. She then went ahead but was still going astern when she hit a ship on the stocks. The depth charge racks which protruded over the stern were forced up over the deck. She then was travelling forward and struck the end of the stone jetty on her starboard side. She suffered serious damage from the &#x27;break&#x27; to the stern.

In 1948 &quot;Gabbard&quot; took part in the Autumn Cruise, which included the two aircraft carriers and , and three other smaller vessels. The cruise deployed to South Africa and the West Indies, performing a number of fly-the-flag visits to a variety of ports, and performing naval exercises and other duties. In 1949, &quot;Gabbard&quot;, escorting &quot;Vengeance&quot; once more, deployed to the cold climate of the Arctic for experiments in that region.

In 1950, &quot;Gabbard&quot;, along with a number of other vessels of the Home Fleet, including three aircraft carriers, such as , and the battleship , undertook a Spring cruise, visiting the Mediterranean, where the Group performed a number of fly-the-flag visits to port, and naval exercises. In 1953, &quot;Gabbard&quot; decommissioned, and was subsequently placed in Reserve.

==Sale to Pakistan==

On 29 February 1956 the Admiralty announced that &quot;Gabbard&quot; was being sold to the Pakistan Navy. She was refitted and modernized with funds made available by the United States Mutual Defence Assistance Programme and commissioned as PNS &quot;Badr&quot; (D-161). The refit was undertaken by Palmers Hebburn, Yarrow. She was handed over to the Pakistan Navy on 24 January 1957 and sailed from Portsmouth to Karachi on 17 February 1957. During the war of 1965 &quot;Badr&quot; participated in Operation Dwarka

<doc id="629770" wikidata="Q2156078" url="?curid=629770" title="Rob Ramage">
<text>George Robert Ramage (born January 11, 1959) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Colorado Rockies, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames, Toronto Maple Leafs, Minnesota North Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers. He also played one season in the World Hockey Association (WHA) for the Birmingham Bulls. He was a two-time Stanley Cup winner in the NHL.

Ramage was born in Byron, Ontario, but grew up in London, Ontario.

==Playing career==
Rob Ramage spent his junior career with the London Knights, playing three seasons as a defenseman, and was highly touted by many scouts. In his final season with the Knights, Ramage shared the OHL&#x27;s Max Kaminsky Trophy as the league&#x27;s most outstanding defenseman with his teammate Brad Marsh. His sweater number 5 was later retired by the team in his honour. Ramage&#x27;s birthday fell 12 days too late to make him eligible for the NHL entry draft, though. Instead of returning to the Knights, Ramage elected to sign a contract with World Hockey Association&#x27;s Birmingham Bulls, as the WHA allowed its clubs to sign players who were younger than 20 years of age. Ramage became a member of an informal group of young Birmingham players known as the &quot;Baby Bulls&quot;, all of whom would go on to successful NHL careers. Ramage&#x27;s WHA rookie year was very successful, at the end of the season he was named a First Team All-Star. At the conclusion of the 1978-79 season, four WHA teams joined the NHL, the rest (including the Birmingham Bulls) ceased operations. Ramage entered the 1979 NHL Entry Draft where he was selected first overall by the Colorado Rockies.

Ramage inadvertently became a part of history in his first season in Colorado. While the Rockies were playing the New York Islanders, the Rockies&#x27; goaltender left the ice for an extra skater after a delayed penalty was called on the Islanders. Before the penalty was called, the puck deflected off the chest protector of Islanders goaltender Billy Smith into the corner. Ramage picked up the puck and made a blind pass from the corner boards in the opposing zone to the blue line. Nobody was there to receive the pass, and so the puck sailed all the way down the length of the ice and into the Colorado net. Smith had been the last Islander to touch the puck, and so he became the first NHL goalie ever to be credited with a goal.

After three seasons with the Rockies, Ramage was traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a first-round draft pick. With the Blues, Ramage developed into a steady and skilled defenseman. During the 1985–86 season, Ramage&#x27;s fourth with the Blues, he posted a career-best 66 points (which was a Blues team record for points by a defenseman). He added 11 more in 19 playoff games as St. Louis made the Stanley Cup semi-finals, losing to the Calgary Flames in seven games.

Two years later, on March 7, 1988, Ramage was traded to the Flames, along with Rick Wamsley, for Brett Hull and Steve Bozek. The blockbuster trade gave the Flames enviable defensive depth by adding Ramage to a core that already boasted veterans Al MacInnis, Gary Suter and Brad McCrimmon. The following year Ramage was part of the team that won the Flames&#x27; first Stanley Cup, but had little time to celebrate before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs for a second-round draft pick.

Ramage was named the 13th captain in Maple Leafs franchise history, and remains the only player in team history to be named team captain before playing a game for the team. He played two years on the Toronto blue line before he was left exposed for the 1991 Expansion and Dispersal Drafts. As part of a complicated deal that saw the Minnesota North Stars&#x27; owners George and Gordon Gund awarded an expansion team in San Jose, they were permitted to raid the roster and farm system of their former club. As a result, a dispersal draft was held that allowed the North Stars to select players from the rest of the league and Minnesota used their first pick to pluck Ramage from the Maple Leafs. Ramage was disappointed to end his tenure with the Maple Leafs in such an ignominious fashion. &quot;It was upsetting. I guess all athletes have a certain amount of pride and to be left unprotected is definitely a blow to that pride.&quot;

Ramage spent one season in Minnesota which was cut short when a knee injury required surgery, before finding himself once again on the unprotected list as the league was set to expand by two more clubs with franchises granted in Ottawa and Tampa Bay.

Ramage was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning but failed to make much of an impression with the club as he struggled with just 17 points in 66 games. Despite his diminishing offensive returns, he was still a respected veteran around the league and was acquired by the Montreal Canadiens in a trade that sent youngsters Éric Charron, Alain Côté and future considerations (Donald Dufresne) to Tampa Bay. A sprained knee caused Ramage to miss the end of the season and the beginning of the playoffs but he eventually played in seven playoff games, helping the Canadiens defeat the Los Angeles Kings for the 1993 Stanley Cup.

The following year, 1993–94, Ramage returned to the Canadiens, but the defending champions had a deep team and the emergence of rookie Peter Popovic made him expendable so he switched teams for the final time in his career. Philadelphia acquired Ramage from the Canadiens for cash and he suited up for the final fifteen games of his career with the Flyers before retiring on July 26, 1994.

Ramage&#x27;s name is on the Stanley Cup as a member of the 1989 Calgary Flames and the 1993 Montreal Canadiens. He also played in four NHL All-Star Games (1981, 1984, 1986, 1988).

==Personal==
He attended Byron Northview Public School and Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario. Ramage married his high school sweetheart Dawn Van Diepen in 1982. They have three children, Tamara, Jaclyn, John, and Dylan

Up until January 23, 2009, Ramage was a broker at the Clayton, Missouri branch of Wachovia Securities (formerly A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. brokerage firm), acquired by Wells Fargo in 2009.

In December 2011, Ramage was named assistant coach of the London Knights after coach Dale Hunter left the team to become head coach of the Washington Capitals.

Rob&#x27;s son, John Ramage, was selected by the Calgary Flames in the 4th round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. John played NCAA Division I college ice hockey with the Wisconsin Badgers men&#x27;s ice hockey, and he was named the USA team captain at the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

On July 30, 2014, Ramage re-joined the Canadiens organization, being appointed player development coach.

Rob is currently the head coach for the St Louis Blues Warriors.

==Death of Keith Magnuson and impaired driving conviction==
On December 15, 2003, Ramage was driving former Chicago Blackhawks defenceman and coach Keith Magnuson to an NHLPA players&#x27; alumni meeting when his rented Chrysler Intrepid car swerved into the oncoming lane near Toronto and collided with another vehicle, killing Magnuson and injuring the driver of the other vehicle. Ramage was charged with impaired driving causing death and dangerous driving causing death. Defense lawyer Brian Greenspan claimed the blood and urine tests were flawed, and the smell of alcohol came from beer cans that exploded after the crash.

On October 10, 2007, Ramage, who had pleaded not guilty, was found guilty on all counts. The Magnuson family had forgiven Ramage and urged the judge not to send him to prison, instead suggesting that Ramage speak to teens about the dangers of drinking and driving. On December 3, 2007, in a Missouri civil suit, Ramage and National Car Rental of Canada were found liable for the death of Magnuson. The family of Magnuson was awarded $9.5 million. On January 17, 2008, Ramage was sentenced to four years in prison. Legal experts described the sentence as the harshest ever handed out in Ontario to a motorist with no previous record for drinking and driving. Ramage remained free on bail until his appeal of the sentence was denied on July 12, 2010.

In July 2010, Ramage began serving his sentence at Frontenac Institution, a minimum security facility in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In March 2011, Ramage made his first application for day parole and release to a halfway house, but this request was denied. The board did grant him permission to leave the minimum-security prison for three-day unescorted absences once a month. The board cited its belief that Ramage did not yet understand the severity of the actions which led to his incarceration. Their concern centered on Ramage&#x27;s drinking habits and whether he took responsibility for the crash. On May 5, 2011, Ramage&#x27;s second request for day parole was granted. He is barred from drinking alcohol and he is restricted from visiting establishments where alcohol is the primary focus. Ramage must undergo psychological counseling and the court order prevents him from driving.

Originally Ramage was not eligible to seek accelerated parole because his crime was considered violent. The federal government is abolishing legal provisions that free some non-violent, first-time offenders as soon as six months into their sentences. Ramage&#x27;s sentence expired in July 2014.

<text>The Cycloteuthidae are a family in the order Oegopsida, comprising two genera. While physically dissimilar, molecular evidence supports the relatedness of the genera. The family is found primarily in mesopelagic tropical to subtropical waters. Cycloteuthidae are characterised by a triangular funnel locking apparatus.

<text>Richard Claude Vaive (; born May 14, 1959) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played in the final season of the World Hockey Association (WHA) and played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1992. While with the Toronto Maple Leafs, he became the first member of that team to score 50 goals in a season.

==Biography==
Vaive was born in Ottawa, Ontario to Claude (d. 2016) and Mary Vaive (d. 2010), and lived in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island after he turned 11. Grandparents Lionel and Reina Vaive were from Gatineau, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1970 and 1971 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Amherst, Nova Scotia.

After a stellar junior hockey career with the Sherbrooke Castors, he began his professional career in 1978-79 in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Birmingham Bulls, with whom he signed as an underage free agent. He was part of a contingent of young players who were nicknamed the &quot;Baby Bulls&quot;, a group which also included Michel Goulet, Craig Hartsburg, Keith Crowder, Gaston Gingras and Pat Riggin. Following the NHL-WHA merger at the end of the season, these youngsters were declared eligible for the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, and Vaive was selected fifth overall by the Vancouver Canucks.

In 1980, the Canucks traded Vaive, along with Bill Derlago, to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Dave &quot;Tiger&quot; Williams and Jerry Butler. In Toronto, Vaive and Derlago were teamed with Pat Hickey, and Derlago became Vaive&#x27;s setup man. Vaive was a prolific scorer for the Leafs, becoming the first player in the team&#x27;s history to score 50 goals in a season. His 54 goals in 1981–82 stood as a franchise record for 40 years before it was broken by Auston Matthews in 2021–22. He served as captain of the Maple Leafs from 1982 to 1986; he was stripped of the captaincy during the 1985–86 NHL season, for missing a morning practice. Vaive was invited to the Canada Cup team in 1984, but was cut in training camp.

In 1987 Vaive was traded, along with Steve Thomas and Bob McGill, to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Al Secord and Ed Olczyk, one of several lamentable deals by team owner Harold Ballard in the 1980s. Vaive netted 43 goals in his first season in Chicago but never managed more than 31 in a season after that. He spent four seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, then retired as a member of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Hamilton Canucks in 1993.

In May 2000, Vaive was inducted into the PEI Sports Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
In 1993, immediately after his retirement as a player, Vaive became coach of the expansion South Carolina Stingrays of the East Coast Hockey League. He led the Stingrays to division titles in 1995 and 1997 and a conference championship in 1997, and in 1996–97 he became the first ECHL coach to win both the Brabham Cup and Kelly Cup in the same season. He then coached the Saint John Flames of the AHL for two seasons. Vaive coached the Mississauga Ice Dogs of the Ontario Hockey League in 2000-01, guiding the team to the worst record in the league and tying the 1995-96 London Knights for fewest wins in a season. He was fired and replaced by Don Cherry.

==Personal==
Vaive hosted various shows on Leafs TV, an MLSE-run property focusing on the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Vaive and his wife Joyce have two sons, Jeff and Justin, who was selected by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft.

<text>Acadie—Bathurst (formerly Gloucester) is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1867.

==Geography==
The district includes eastern Gloucester County, and the communities along Nepisiguit Bay. The neighbouring ridings are Miramichi (electoral district) and Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

==History==
Created at Confederation in 1867, the electoral district was known as Gloucester until a 1990 Act of Parliament renamed it to its current designation.

After electoral boundary changes in 2003, residents argued that regional interests, particularly linguistic representation, were improperly diluted. The Library of Parliament recounts the Federal Court of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Raîche v. Canada (Attorney General&quot; decision:

:&quot;The Court held that while the electoral boundaries commission for New Brunswick had been within its right to try keep any variance in the population of electoral districts under 10%, it did not correctly interpret the spirit of the EBRA (&quot;Electoral Bounds Readjustment Act&quot;) when it failed to consider whether a greater variation in regard of community of interest and regional features would be desirable for any electoral districts. The Court declared invalid the Miramichi and Acadie–Bathurst electoral boundaries.&quot;
The current boundaries reverted to the ones used in the 1996 representation after the 2006 election. As per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding gained a small territory from what was part of Miramichi.

The 1997 general election saw the NDP take the riding for the first time, with Yvon Godin holding the district until 2015.

==Student vote results==

A student vote was conducted at participating Canadian schools to parallel Canadian federal election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="629780" wikidata="Q1166725" url="?curid=629780" title="Darryl Sittler">
<text>Darryl Glen Sittler (born September 18, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1970 until 1985 for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Detroit Red Wings. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Canadian Walk of Fame in 2016. In 2017 Sittler was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

On February 7, 1976, Sittler set an NHL record for most points by an individual in one game when he scored ten points (six goals and four assists) against the Boston Bruins. He also remains the most recent NHL player to score six goals in one game.

==Playing career==

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Sittler grew up in St. Jacobs, Ontario, and played minor hockey in nearby Elmira. He was drafted out of the Junior C Elmira Sugar Kings by the London Nationals, soon renamed the London Knights, and played under coaches Turk Broda and Bep Guidolin.

Sittler was selected eighth overall by the Maple Leafs in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft. He was named team captain on September 10, 1975, after Dave Keon left the team to play in the World Hockey Association following a contract dispute with Leafs owner Harold Ballard.

In his first season as captain, Sittler finished the season with 41 goals and 59 assists, being the first Leaf ever to reach the 100 point mark. A few months later, he tied the playoff record for most goals in one game, with five against the Philadelphia Flyers. That summer, in the inaugural Canada Cup, he scored in overtime to win the final series for Team Canada over Czechoslovakia.

On February 7, 1976, in a game between Toronto and Boston at Maple Leaf Gardens, Sittler set an NHL record that still stands by tallying six goals and adding four assists for ten points (eclipsing Maurice Richard&#x27;s record of eight, set in 1944). All his points were scored against rookie goalie Dave Reece in an 11–4 Maple Leaf victory.

In 1977–78, Sittler&#x27;s 117 points ranked him third in regular-season scoring behind Guy Lafleur and Bryan Trottier, and also earned him a Second Team All-Star selection. Sittler&#x27;s scoring totals remained a Leafs record until being surpassed by Doug Gilmour in 1992–93.

The 1978–79 season saw Sittler suffer some knee problems and miss ten games. It was also the year Leafs owner Ballard fired and then rehired coach Roger Neilson, a process which saw Sittler lobby on the players&#x27; behalf for Neilson&#x27;s reinstatement.

Sittler&#x27;s relationship with Ballard slowly deteriorated, particularly after Ballard hired Punch Imlach as general manager in July 1979. Imlach and Ballard both had strained relations with NHLPA executive director Alan Eagleson, who, as a player agent, represented more than a dozen Leafs, including Sittler and his best friend and linemate, Lanny McDonald. Imlach believed Sittler had too much influence on the team and tried to undermine his authority with the players. When Sittler and goaltender Mike Palmateer agreed to appear on the TV show &quot;Showdown&quot;, as negotiated by the NHLPA, Imlach went to court to obtain an injunction to stop them. When Imlach said he was open to offers for Sittler from other teams, Eagleson said it would cost $500,000 to get Sittler to waive the no-trade clause in his contract. So, instead of trading Sittler, Imlach sent McDonald to the woeful Colorado Rockies on December 29, 1979. In response, Sittler ripped the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; off his sweater, later commenting a captain had to be the go-between with players and management, and he no longer had any communication with management. Ballard would liken Sittler&#x27;s actions to burning the Canadian flag.

Through the summer, Ballard insisted Sittler would not be back with the Leafs. But before the start of the 1980–81 season, Sittler and Ballard appeared at a news conference described as &quot;all smiles and buddy-buddy&quot; to announce that Sittler would be at training camp. He showed up with the &quot;C&quot; back on his sweater, reassuming the role of team captain. Sittler had arranged the talks with Ballard on his own. The discussions took place with Imlach hospitalized following his second heart attack. At the news conference, Ballard said the real battle had been between Imlach and Eagleson, and Sittler just got caught in the crossfire.

During the 1981–82 season, Ballard considered Imlach&#x27;s health to be too poor for him to continue as general manager. But even with Imlach gone, Sittler&#x27;s relationship with the Leafs worsened to the point where he told Ballard and acting general manager Gerry McNamara at the end of November he would waive his no-trade clause if he was sent to the Flyers or the Minnesota North Stars. In the first week of December, Eagleson agreed to terms with Flyers&#x27; owner Ed Snider and North Stars&#x27; general manager Lou Nanne. But it took another seven weeks for the Leafs to make a deal. During that time, Sittler added the Islanders and Buffalo Sabres to the list of teams he could be traded to. On January 5, 1982, on advice from his physician, Sittler walked out on the Leafs, saying he was &quot;mentally depressed&quot; because a trade was taking so long to complete.

===Philadelphia Flyers and Detroit Red Wings===

Finally, on January 20, 1982, the 31-year-old Sittler was traded to the Flyers for Rich Costello plus the Hartford Whalers&#x27; second-round pick in the 1982 draft (used by the Leafs to select Peter Ihnačák), and future considerations, which ended up being Ken Strong. Only Ihnačák would play regularly for the Leafs. In 1980, Imlach had rejected an offer from Philadelphia, who were said to be willing to trade Rick MacLeish and André Dupont for Sittler.

With the Flyers in 1982–83, Sittler earned his fourth All-Star game appearance. He returned to the Flyers the following season. Before the 1984–85 season, Sittler was told he would be named the Flyers&#x27; team captain. On the day the announcement was to be made—Sittler even had a brief speech prepared—he was instead told by Flyers&#x27; newly appointed general manager Bobby Clarke he had been traded to the Detroit Red Wings for Murray Craven and Joe Paterson. It was this incident that Sittler described as the biggest disappointment of his life. &quot;Clarke can&#x27;t come close to realizing how much he hurt me, and my family, that day,&quot; he wrote in his 1991 autobiography. Sittler contemplated retirement and did not report to the Wings for a few days, but then joined the team. He had an unproductive season, struggling to get ice time under coach Nick Polano, and finishing the year with the worst goals-per-game average of his NHL career. The Red Wings bought out Sittler&#x27;s contract after the end of the season. He received a one-year contract offer from the Vancouver Canucks, but decided to retire.

==After retirement from playing==
Sittler was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1991, a year after Ballard died, he rejoined the Maple Leafs organization as a consultant under general manager Cliff Fletcher, also performing public relations duties for the team on an ongoing basis. In 1998, he was ranked number 93 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. On February 8, 2003, the Leafs honoured Sittler by adding a banner with his number 27 to those already hanging in the Air Canada Centre for other Leafs greats. In a ceremony, Sittler, with his three grown children at his side, paid tribute to his wife Wendy, who had died of cancer the previous year.

In 2004, Sittler appeared as himself in a brief cameo in season two, episode two of the Canadian sitcom, &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. The episode centred around the disputed ownership of one of Sittler&#x27;s rookie cards.

Vancouver songwriters Dan Swinimer and Jeff Johnson wrote a country song commemorating Sittler&#x27;s 60th birthday called &quot;The Darryl Sittler Song&quot;.

Sittler travels across Canada doing public speaking, autograph signings and appearances for various companies, charities and organizations. Sittler also serves as a director to a number of mineral exploration companies, including Wallbridge Mining.

Sittler was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame on August 23, 2016. On October 15, 2016, number 27 worn by Sittler and Frank Mahovlich was officially retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs, along with the numbers of 16 other players, to celebrate the team&#x27;s 100th season.

==Personal life==
He is the older brother of Gary Sittler who played five games in the World Hockey Association during the 1974–75 WHA season.

His son, Ryan Sittler, was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, played hockey at the University of Michigan, and represented the United States at the World Junior Championships on three occasions.

His daughter Meaghan Sittler played four seasons at Colby College and on the United States national women&#x27;s hockey team.

In July 1980, Sittler presented Terry Fox with his NHL All-Star Game jersey in Nathan Phillips Square in front of a crowd of over 10,000 supporters. Fox had said Sittler was one of his favourite athletes.

<doc id="629784" wikidata="Q1160372" url="?curid=629784" title="Laz language">
<text>The Laz or Lazuri language () is a Kartvelian language spoken by the Laz people on the southeastern shore of the Black Sea. In 2007, it was estimated that there were around 20,000 native speakers in Turkey, in a strip of land extending from Melyat to the Georgian border (officially called Lazistan until 1925), and around 1,000 native speakers around Adjara in Georgia. There are also around 1,000 native speakers of Laz in Germany.

Laz is not historically a written language or literary language. As of 1989, Benninghaus could write that the Laz themselves had no interest in writing in Laz.

Laz is one of the four Kartvelian languages also known as South Caucasian languages. Along with Mingrelian, it forms the Zan branch of this Kartvelian language family. The two languages are very closely related, to the extent that some linguists refer to Mingrelian and Laz as dialects or regional variants of a single &quot;Zan language&quot;, a view held officially in the Soviet era and still so in Georgia today. In general, however, Mingrelian and Laz are considered as separate languages, due both to the long-standing separation of their communities of speakers (500 years) and to a lack of mutual intelligibility.

==History==
Although the Laz people are recorded in written sources repeatedly from antiquity onwards, the earliest written evidence of their language is from 1787. There is a poem in Evliya Çelebi&#x27;s &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot; (17th century) that has been interpreted as Laz, but it is more likely to represent Pontic Greek. The first definite record of Laz in 1787 was produced by the Spanish Jesuit linguist Lorenzo Hervás. It was largely ignored because Hervás conflated the name of the language with that of the Lezgian language, calling it &quot;lingua Lasga, detta ancora Laza, e Lassa&quot;. In 1823, Julius Heinrich von Klaproth published a list of 67 Laz words with German translations in his &quot;Asia Polyglotta&quot;. He identified three dialects. In 1844, Georg Rosen published in German the first monograph on Laz, &quot;Über die Sprache der Lazen&quot;. In 1887, the British diplomat Demetrius Rudolph Peacock included Laz among five languages of the western Caucasus in a paper designed for the use of English-speaking diplomats.

=== Statistics in Turkey (1935–2007) ===
== Geographical distribution ==

The Georgian language, along with its relatives Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan, comprise the Kartvelian language family. The initial breakup of Proto-Kartvelian is estimated to have been around 2500–2000 B.C., with the divergence of Svan from Proto-Kartvelian (Nichols, 1998). Assyrian, Urartian, Greek, and Roman documents reveal that in early historical times (2nd–1st millennia B.C.), the numerous Kartvelian tribes were in the process of migrating into the Caucasus from the southwest. The northern coast and coastal mountains of Asia Minor were dominated by Kartvelian peoples at least as far west as Samsun. Their eastward migration may have been set in motion by the fall of Troy (dated by Eratosthenes to 1183 B.C.). It thus appears that the Kartvelians represent an intrusion into the Georgian plain from northeastern Anatolia, displacing their predecessors, the unrelated Northwest Caucasian and Vainakh peoples, into the Caucasian highlands (Tuite, 1996; Nichols, 2004).

The oldest known settlement of the Lazoi is the town of Lazos or &quot;old Lazik&quot;, which Arrian places 680 stadia (about 80 miles) south of the Sacred Port, Novorossiisk, and 1,020 stadia (100 miles) north of Pityus, i.e., somewhere in the neighborhood of Tuapse. Kiessling sees in the Lazoi a section of the Kerketai, who in the first century A.D. had to migrate southwards under pressure from the Zygoi. The same author regards the Kerketai as a &quot;Georgian&quot; tribe. The fact is that at the time of Arrian (2nd century A.D.), the Lazoi were already living to the south of Um. The order of the peoples living along the coast to the east of Trebizond was as follows: Colchi (and Sanni); Machelones; Heniochi; Zydritae; Lazai, subjects of King Malassus, who owned the suzerainty of Rome; Apsilae; Abacsi; and Sanigae near Sebastopolis.

=== Social and cultural status ===

Laz has no official status in either Turkey or Georgia, and no written standard. It is presently used only for familiar and casual interaction; for literary, business, and other purposes, Laz speakers use their country&#x27;s official language (Turkish or Georgian).

Laz is unique among the Kartvelian languages in that most of its speakers live in Turkey rather than Georgia. While the differences between the various dialects are minor, their speakers feel that their level of mutual intelligibility is low. Given that there is no common standard form of Laz, speakers of its different dialects use Turkish to communicate with each other.

Between 1930 and 1938, Zan (Laz and Mingrelian) enjoyed cultural autonomy in Georgia and was used as a literary language, but an official standard form of the language was never established. Since then, all attempts to create a written tradition in Zan have failed, despite the fact that most intellectuals use it as a literary language.

In Turkey, Laz has been a written language since 1984, when a script based on the Turkish alphabet was created. Since then, this system has been used in most of the handful of publications that have appeared in Laz. Developed specifically for the Kartvelian languages, the Georgian alphabet is better suited to the sounds of Laz, but the fact that most of the language&#x27;s speakers live in Turkey, where the Latin alphabet is used, has rendered the adoption of the former impossible. Nonetheless, 1991 saw the publication of a textbook called Nana-nena (&#x27;Mother tongue&#x27;), which was aimed at all Laz speakers and used both the Latin and Georgian alphabets. The first Laz–Turkish dictionary was published in 1999.

Speaking Laz was forbidden in Turkey between 1980 and 1991, because doing so was seen as a political threat to the unity of the country. During this era, some academicians lamented the existence of the Laz ethnic group. Because speaking Laz was banned in public areas, many children lost their mother tongue as a result of not communicating with their parents. Most Laz people have a heavy Turkish accent because they cannot practice their mother tongue.

== Phonology ==
Like many languages of the Caucasus, Laz has a rich consonantal system but only five vowels (a, e, i, o, u). 


== Writing system ==

Laz is written in Mkhedruli script and in an extension of the Turkish alphabet. For the Laz letters written in the Latin script, the first is a letter from the writing system introduced in Turkey in 1984 that was developed by Fahri Lazoğlu and Wolfgang Feurstein and the second is the transcription system used by Caucasianists.
== Grammar ==

The nouns are inflected with agglutinative suffixes to indicate grammatical function (four to seven cases, depending on the dialect) and number (singular or plural), but not by gender.
The Laz verb is inflected with suffixes according to person and number, and also for grammatical tense, aspect, mood, and (in some dialects) evidentiality. Up to 50 verbal prefixes are used to indicate spatial orientation/direction. Person and number suffixes provided for the subject as well as for one or two objects involved in the action, e.g. &quot;gimpulam&quot; = &quot;I hide it from you&quot;.

Some distinctive features of Laz among its family are:
* All nouns end with a vowel.
* More extensive verb inflection, using directional prefixes.
* Some lexical borrowings from Greek and Turkic languages.

<doc id="629851" wikidata="Q170419" url="?curid=629851" title="Carlos Slim">
<text>Carlos Slim Helú (; born 28 January 1940) is a Mexican business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. From 2010 to 2013, Slim was ranked as the richest person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; business magazine. He derived his fortune from his extensive holdings in a considerable number of Mexican companies through his conglomerate, Grupo Carso. , the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; ranked him as the 18th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$85 billion or about 4% of Mexico&#x27;s GDP, making him the richest person in Latin America.

Slim&#x27;s corporate conglomerate spans numerous industries across the Mexican economy, including education, health care, industrial manufacturing, transportation, real estate, mass media, mining, energy, entertainment, technology, retail, sports and financial services. However, the core of his fortune derives from telecommunications, where he owns América Móvil (with operations throughout Latin America) and the Mexican carrier Telcel and ISP Telmex, a state-run-gone-private company which maintained a virtual monopoly for many years after Slim&#x27;s acquisition. He accounts for 40% of the listings on the Mexican Stock Exchange, while his net worth is equivalent to about 6% of Mexico&#x27;s gross domestic product. As of 2016, he was the largest single shareholder of non-voting shares of the New York Times Company. In 2017, he sold half of his shares.

== Early life ==
Slim was born on 28 January 1940, in Mexico City, to Julián Slim Haddad (born Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz) and Linda Helú Atta, both Maronite Christians from Lebanon. He decided at a young age that he wanted to be a businessman when he grew up, and received business lessons from his father, who taught him basic financial, business management, and accounting principles by instructing him in how to analyze and interpret financial statements in addition to stressing the young Carlos in the importance of keeping accurate financial records when doing business.

At the age of 11, Slim invested in a government savings bond, which taught him about the concept of compound interest. Adhering to his father&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of keeping accurate financial records, he eventually saved every financial and business transaction he ever made into a personal ledger book, which he still keeps to this day. At the age of 12, he made his first stock investment, by buying shares outright of a Mexican bank. By the age of 15, Slim had become a shareholder in Mexico&#x27;s largest bank. At the age of 17, he earned 200 pesos a week working for his father&#x27;s company. He went on to study civil engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he also concurrently taught algebra and linear programming.

Though Slim was a civil engineering major, he also displayed an interest in economics. Broadening his academic interests outside his traditional area of study beyond civil engineering, he took economics courses in Chile when he completed his engineering degree. Graduating as a civil engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical ability and his background of linear programming was a key factor in helping him gain a competitive edge in the business world, especially when analyzing the financial statements of prospective companies while making his business decisions as well as evaluating potential investment acquisitions and stock purchases.

== Business career ==
=== 1960s ===
After graduating from university in 1961, Slim launched his business career by starting off as a stock trader in Mexico, often working 14-hour days to make a name for himself in the Mexican business world. In 1965, profits from Slim&#x27;s private business and investment ventures reached , enabling him to start the stock brokerage house Inversora Bursátil. He also began laying the financial groundwork for his eventual conglomerate, Grupo Carso. In 1965, he also acquired Jarritos del Sur, a Mexican bottling and soft drink company. In 1966, worth , he established Inmuebles Carso, a Mexican real estate agency and holding company.

=== 1970s ===
Companies in the Mexican construction, soft drink, printing, real estate, bottling and mining industries were the initial focus of Slim&#x27;s burgeoning business career. He later expanded his business operations and commercial activities by venturing into numerous industries across the Mexican economy including auto parts, aluminum, airlines, chemicals, tobacco, cable and wire manufacturing, paper and packaging, copper and mineral extraction, tires, cement, retail, hotels, beverage distributors, telecommunications and financial services (Slim&#x27;s Grupo Financiero Inbursa sells insurance and manages mutual funds and pension plans for millions of ordinary Mexicans). By 1972, he had established or acquired a further seven businesses in these industry categories, which included the acquisition of a construction equipment rental company. In 1980, he consolidated his business interests by forming Grupo Galas as the parent company of a conglomerate that had interests in industrial manufacturing, construction, mining, retail, food, and tobacco.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982, the Mexican economy contracted rapidly. As many banks were struggling and foreign investors were cutting back on investing and scurrying, Slim began investing heavily and acquired shares in a plethora of Mexican flagship businesses outright at depressed valuations. Much of Slim&#x27;s business dealings involved a simple strategy, which entails buying a business and retaining it for its cash flow, or eventually selling the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the capital gains as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business. In addition, the complexity of Grupo Carso&#x27;s corporate conglomerate structural labyrinth web of companies allows Slim to purchase a manifold of stakes across a wide range of industries, thereby making the overall conglomerate nearly recession-proof in the event that one or more industry sectors of the Mexican economy underperform.

Amidst the Mexican economic downturn before its gradual recovery in 1985, Slim invested heavily by snapping up numerous Mexican flagship companies for pennies on the dollar. He purchased all or a sizeable percentage of numerous Mexican businesses outright at significant discounts. Among the panoply of acquisitions that Slim procured included Empresas Frisco, a mining concessionary and chemical maker, Industrias Nacobre, a copper manufacturer, Reynolds Aluminio, a Mexican aluminum concern, Compañía Hulera Euzkadi (Mexico&#x27;s largest tire maker), and Bimex hotels, a hotel chain. He also became the majority shareholder of Sanborn Hermanos, a prominent Mexican food retailer, gift shop and restaurant chain, which was later incorporated as Grupo Carso&#x27;s retailing arm. In 1984, Slim spent to acquire Mexican insurance agency Seguros de México, and later subsumed the company into the firm, Seguros Inbursa. The value of his stake in Seguros eventually grew to being worth by 2007, after four spinoffs. Slim also acquired a 40% and 50% interest in the Mexican arms of British American Tobacco and The Hershey Company, respectively. He acquired large blocks of Denny&#x27;s and Firestone Tires. From Seguros de México, Fianzas La Guardiana and Casa de Bolsa Inbursa, he formed the Grupo Financiero Inbursa, a Mexican financial services provider. Many of these corporate acquisitions were financed by the income-generating revenues and cash flows derived from Cigatam, a Mexican tobacco distributor that he purchased in the economic downturn that hit Mexico during the early 1980s.

In 1988, Slim bought Nacobre, a Mexican copper manufacturer that manufactured, marketed and distributed copper and copper alloy products, along with Química Fluor, a Mexican chemical maker.

=== 1990s ===
Slim realized windfall profits in the early 1990s when the Mexican government began privatizing its telecom industry. Capitalizing on the bevy of potential business opportunities that could crop up and be exploited through this political change motivated Slim and his conglomerate Grupo Carso to acquire Telmex, a landline telecommunications operator from the Mexican government. In 1990, Grupo Carso was floated as a public company initially in Mexico and then worldwide. During the same year, Grupo Carso also acquired a majority ownership of Porcelanite, a Mexican tilemaker.

To ultimately realize his further commercial business ambitions and reap the material benefits that would eventually transpire through the acquisition of Telmex, Slim acted in concert later in 1990 with the French telecom operator France Télécom and the American telco Southwestern Bell Corporation to purchase the landline telecommunications service provider from the Mexican government, when the opportunity for Slim to purchase the telco presented itself and materialized when Mexico began privatizing its national industries at the turn of the 1980s. Slim was an early investment backer in Telmex, where the concomitant income-producing cash flows and revenue-generating profits of the telecommunications provider eventually formed the bulk of his private fortune. By 2006, Telmex controlled and operated 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico, and his wireless telecommunications company, Telcel, which was created out of the Radiomóvil Dipsa company, operated almost 80 percent of the entire country&#x27;s cellphones.

In 1991, he acquired Hoteles Calinda (now OSTAR Grupo Hotelero), a hotel chain and in 1993, he increased his stakes in General Tire, an American tiremaker and a distributor of aluminum profiles and aluminum concern Grupo Aluminio to the point where he had a majority interest in the company.

In 1996, Slim split Grupo Carso into three separate constituent companies: Carso Global Telecom, Grupo Carso, and Invercorporación. In the following year, Slim bought the Mexican arm of Sears Roebuck.

In 1999, Slim began expanding his business interests beyond Latin America. Though the bulk of his business holdings remained in Mexico, he began setting his sights on exploring the United States as a target destination to exploit potential foreign investment acquisitions and new emerging business opportunities.

=== 2000s ===
Slim made headlines within the American business scene in 2003 when he began purchasing large stakes in a number of major US retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Circuit City, Borders, and CompUSA. Much of the rationale behind Slim&#x27;s international commercial expansion beyond Mexico was due to a running joke in Mexican business circles that &quot;there was nothing left to acquire in Mexico.&quot; He set up a Telmex USA branch and also acquired a stake in Tracfone, an American cellular telephone operator. Concurrently, Slim established Carso Infraestructura y Construcción, S. A. (CICSA) as a non-profit subsidiary construction and engineering firm within Grupo Carso. During the same year, Slim underwent heart surgery and subsequently passed on much of his day-to-day corporate involvement to his children and their spouses.

América Telecom, the holding company for América Móvil, was incorporated in 2000. Concurrently, Telmex also spun off its international cellular phone division for a $15 billion listing of América Móvil SA on the New York Stock Exchange. Telmex has taken numerous stakes of various international cellular telephone operators outside of Mexico, including the Brazilian ATL and Telecom Americas concerns, Techtel in Argentina, and others in Guatemala and Ecuador. In subsequent years, the company made further investments across Latin America, with companies in Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Chile, Honduras, and El Salvador, well as a joint venture with the American software house, Microsoft called Tlmsn, a Spanish-language web portal.

In 2005, Slim invested in Volaris, a Mexican airline and founded Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en América Latina SAB de CV (using the acronym &quot;IDEAL&quot;—roughly translated as &quot;Promoter of Development and Employment in Latin America&quot;), a Mexican construction and civil engineering company primarily engaged in not-for-profit infrastructure development. Since 2006, IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition from a number of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies.

In 2007, after having amassed a 50.1% stake in the Cigatam tobacco manufacturer, Slim sold a large portion of his equity to Philip Morris for US$1.1billion. During the same year, Slim sold off his entire stake of Porcelanite for US$800 million, a Mexican tile-maker that he acquired back in 1990. He also licensed the Saks name and opened the Mexican arm of Saks Fifth Avenue retailer in Santa Fe, Mexico. Also in 2007, the estimated value of all of Slim&#x27;s companies totaled US$150billion. On December 8, 2007, Grupo Carso announced that the remaining 103 CompUSA retail stores would be either liquidated or sold, bringing an end to the struggling company, although the information technology division of CompUSA continued operating under the name Telvista around various American cities such as Dallas, Texas (U.S. Corporate Office), and Danville, Virginia. Telvista also has five centers in Mexico (three in Tijuana, one center in Mexicali, and one in México City). After 28 years of corporate involvement, Slim became the Honorary Lifetime Chairman of the business.

In 2008, Slim took a 6.4% stake valued at $27 million in the New York Times Company, a prominent American newspaper publisher. Slim increased his stake to 8% by 2012. Slim&#x27;s stake in the Times increased again to 16.8% of the company&#x27;s Class A shares on 20 January 2015 when he exercised stock options to purchase 15.9 million shares, making him the largest shareholder in the company. The New York Times Company&#x27;s Class A shares are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held. According to the company&#x27;s 2016 annual filings, Slim owned 17.4% of the company&#x27;s Class A shares, and none of the company&#x27;s Class B shares.

=== 2010s ===
In 2012, Slim sold the broadcast rights for the Leon games to the American terrestrial television network, Telemundo, the cable channel Fox Sports in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, and the website mediotiempo.com. The games are also broadcast on the Internet through UNO TV, offered by Telmex. Slim has been involved with broadcasting sports outside Mexico to larger markets such as the United States. In March 2012, América Móvil acquired the broadcast rights for the Olympic Games in Sochi 2014 and the Brazil 2016 for Latin America.

In March 2012, Slim, along with American television host Larry King, established Ora TV, an on-demand digital television network that produces and distributes television shows including &quot;Larry King Now&quot;, &quot;Politicking with Larry King&quot;, &quot;Recessionista, and Jesse Ventura Uncensored&quot;.

In September 2012, Slim bought 30% stakes in Pachuca and León, two Mexican soccer teams through his telecommunications company América Móvil. In December 2012, he bought all the shares of the second division team Estudiantes Tecos. Slim has also completed business deals for the television rights to games of the Leon soccer team. His company América Móvil purchased 30 percent of the team along with transmission rights as Slim does not have the rights to transmit content by broadcast television or cable TV as well as putting him in competition with Televisa and TV Azteca, two television companies with rights to the rest of Mexican soccer&#x27;s first division.

In July 2013, Slim&#x27;s company América Móvil invested US$40million in Shazam, a British commercial mobile phone-based music identification service for an undisclosed share of ownership. América Móvil partnered with the company to aid its growth into advertising and television and help the audio recognition service expand in Latin America.

In November 2013, Slim invested US$60 million in the Israeli startup Mobli, a company that deals with connections between people and communities corralled according to different interests.

In December 2013, Slim&#x27;s private equity fund, Sinca Inbursa, sold its stake in the Mexican pharmaceutical company Landsteiner Scientific. Slim acquired a 27.51% stake in the company in June 2008, which represented 6.6% of Sinca&#x27;s investment portfolio. The private equity fund&#x27;s investments are mainly concentrated in the transportation and infrastructure sectors and the fund garnered a total market cap of 5.152 billion pesos at the end of 2012.

On 23 April 2014, Slim took control of Telekom Austria, Austria&#x27;s largest telecommunications company, which operates telcos in countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia, and Belarus, under a 10-year agreement. It was Slim&#x27;s first successful business acquisition in Europe. In a syndicate holding structure the Austrian state holding company OIAG&#x27;s 28% are combined with Slim&#x27;s 27% ownership. América Móvil will spend as much as to buy out minority shareholders in a mandatory public offer and invest up to 1billion euros () into the company, which it sees as &quot;platform for expansion into central and eastern Europe&quot;. Labor representatives boycotted attending the OIAG supervisory board meeting for 12 hours criticizing the lack of explicit job guarantees.

In January 2015, Grupo Carso publicly launched Claro Musica, an online music service that is a Latin American equivalent of iTunes and Spotify. Slim, along with his son, increased their corporate presence in Mexico&#x27;s music industry, particularly in the retail music sector since 2013. Sanborn&#x27;s, the Mexican retail department store chain owned by Slim controls a majority stake in Mixup, Mexico&#x27;s most successful retail music store that comprises a chain of 117-store Mexican retailers Mixup also generated more than in revenue in 2014.

In March 2015, Slim made his presence known in the Spanish business scene by buying stakes in various troubled Spanish companies while perusing potential acquisitions across Europe. Slim&#x27;s investment company, Inmobiliaria Carso, announced it will buy a stake in the Spanish bank, Bankia, which couples with Slim&#x27;s other purchase of Realia, a Spanish real estate company, where Slim is the second largest shareholder holding a 25% equity stake, behind Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, a Spanish construction company where Slim is also an active minor shareholder.

On 15 April 2015, Slim formed the oil company Carso Oil &amp; Gas. A report that was released by the new company listed its assets at 3.5billion pesos (approximately ), placed within 17.7million shares. Upon the formation of the company, Slim remained sanguine about the company&#x27;s future potential and Mexico&#x27;s burgeoning energy sector where the state monopoly ceased to exist. 

On 25 July 2015, Slim&#x27;s investment group &quot;Control Empresarial de Capitales&quot; invested in IMatchative, a technology startup that ranks the world&#x27;s hedge funds creating in-depth behavioral profiles and business analytics. Limited partners pay per subscription while hedge fund managers pay half the price and also sign up for a free version of the products the company offers.

=== 2020s ===
On 12 June 2024, Slim acquired a 3% stake in British telecommunications company BT worth approximately £400million.

==Family and personal life==
Slim&#x27;s father, Khalil Salim Haddad Aglamaz, was born on 17 July 1888 in Jezzine, Lebanon (then part of the Ottoman Empire). In 1902, at the age of 14, Haddad emigrated to Mexico alone, and later changed his name to Julián Slim Haddad. It was not uncommon for Lebanese children to be sent abroad before they reached the age of 15 to avoid being conscripted into the Ottoman Army, and four of Haddad&#x27;s older brothers were already living in Mexico at the time of his arrival.

In 1911, Julián established a dry goods retail store, La Estrella de Oriente (The Star of the Orient). By 1921, he had begun investing in real estate in the flourishing commercial district of Mexico City where Julián acquired prime Mexican real estate at fire sale prices and in the Zocalo District during the 1910–1917 Mexican Revolution. By 1922, Julián&#x27;s net worth reached $1,012,258 pesos, shrewdly diversified among a vast array of various cash flow-producing assets that included large swathes incoming-producing investment-grade real estate, a multifarious assemblage of privately-controlled businesses, and stocks.

In August 1926, Julián Slim married Linda Helú Atta. Linda, of Lebanese ancestry, was born in Parral, Chihuahua. Her parents had immigrated to Mexico from Lebanon in the late 19th century. Upon immigrating to Mexico, her parents founded one of the first Arabic-language magazines for the Lebanese-Mexican community, using a printing press they had brought with them. Julian and Linda had six children: Nour, Alma, Julián, José, Carlos, and Linda. Julián senior died in 1953, when Carlos was 13 years old.

Julian&#x27;s panoply of successful business ventures and investment undertakings became the source of considerable wealth for himself and his family. As a prominent businessman and wealthy investor who remained a reputable pillar within the Lebanese Mexican community, Julian was known for his shrewd business acumen and his astute knack when making investments during bad economic cycles (which occurred frequently in Mexico). Julián was known for his business savvy, strong work ethic, and commitment to traditional Lebanese moral values.

In February 2011, Julian, the oldest brother of Carlos, died aged 74. He was an active businessman and worked in one of Mexico&#x27;s top intelligence agencies.

=== Personal life ===
Carlos Slim was married to Soumaya Domit from 1967 until her death in 1999. Among her interests were various philanthropic projects. Slim has six children: Carlos, Marco Antonio, Patrick, Soumaya, Vanessa, and Johanna. His three older sons serve in key positions in the companies controlled by Slim where most are involved in the day-to-day running of Slim&#x27;s business empire. Slim underwent heart surgery in 1999. In high school, Slim&#x27;s favorite subjects were history, cosmography, and mathematics. Slim and his wife had a very happy marriage, and he indicated that he does not intend to remarry.

In his office, Slim does not have a computer, and instead keeps all his financial data in hand-written notebooks. Due to the vast size of his business empire, he often jokes that he cannot keep track of all the companies he manages. Slim is a Maronite Catholic, and he is one of the prominent backers of Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic religious institute.

== Personal fortune ==
=== Wealth ===
On 29 March 2007, Slim surpassed American investor Warren Buffett as the world&#x27;s second richest person with an estimated net worth of compared with Buffett&#x27;s .

On 4 August 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ran a cover story profiling Slim. The article said, &quot;While the market value of his stake in publicly traded companies could decline at any time, at the moment he is probably wealthier than Bill Gates&quot;. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Slim credits part of his ability to &quot;discover investment opportunities&quot; early to the writings of his friend, futurist author Alvin Toffler.

On 8 August 2007, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine reported that Slim had overtaken Gates as the world&#x27;s richest person. Slim&#x27;s estimated fortune soared to , based on the value of his public holdings at the end of July. Gates&#x27; net worth was estimated to be at least .

On 5 March 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Slim as the world&#x27;s second-richest person, behind Warren Buffett and ahead of Bill Gates.
On 11 March 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Slim as the world&#x27;s third-richest person, behind Gates and Buffett and ahead of Larry Ellison.

=== Real estate ===

Slim is an active real estate investor. His real estate holding company, Inmobiliaria Carso has developed, invested, owned and operated an extensive portfolio of residential and commercial real estate properties across Mexico since the 1960s. His real estate company constructed Plaza Carso in Mexico City, where most of his business ventures share a common headquarters address. Since the early 2000s to the mid-2010s, Slim has been making private real estate investments internationally beyond Mexico, particularly in Spain and the United States.

In May 2014, Slim opened Inbursa Aquarium, Latin America&#x27;s largest aquarium. Slim owns the Duke Seamans mansion, a 1901 beaux arts house on 5th Avenue in New York City, which he bought for $44 million in 2010. The mansion is 20,000 square feet and has 12 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a doctor&#x27;s office in the basement. In May 2015, he listed the property for sale at $80 million, nearly twice the amount of what he had initially paid for. In April 2015, Slim bought the Marquette Building in Detroit and purchased PepsiCo Americas Beverages headquarters in Somers, New York, for . Slim owns a second mansion in New York City at 10 West 56th Street, which he bought in 2011 for .

In March 2015, Slim began eyeing Spain as a potential investment destination, by purchasing cheap properties in Spain&#x27;s real estate sector at rock-bottom prices in its ailing economy.

=== Reactions ===
Slim&#x27;s immense wealth has been a subject of controversy, because it has been amassed in a developing country where average per capita income does not exceed a year, and nearly 17% of the population lives in poverty. Critics claim that Slim is a monopolist, pointing to Telmex&#x27;s control of 90% of the Mexican landline telephone market. Slim&#x27;s wealth is the equivalent of roughly 5% of Mexico&#x27;s annual economic output. Telmex, of which 49.1% is owned by Slim and his family, charges among the highest usage fees in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

According to Celso Garrido, economist at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Slim&#x27;s domination of Mexico&#x27;s conglomerates prevents the growth of smaller companies, resulting in a shortage of paying jobs, forcing many Mexicans to seek better lives in the U.S.

Slim was criticized by the Dutch minister of economic affairs, Henk Kamp, in 2013 for attempting to expand his telecommunications empire beyond the Americas by América Móvil&#x27;s buy-out offer to KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications operator. Kamp reiterated his criticisms of Slim stating: &quot;an acquisition of KPN by a &#x27;foreign company&#x27; could have consequences for the Netherlands&#x27; national security&quot;. Two years after Slim&#x27;s failed bid to take over the company, mainly due to political intervention and Slim&#x27;s paucity of interest in purchasing the company, Slim&#x27;s América Móvil SAB began offering 2.25billion euros. América Móvil now controls a 21.1 percent stake of KPN with a market value of 3.1billion euros as of 20 May 2015. Slim has been slowly decreasing his holdings since he was forced to withdraw a 7.2-billion-euro bid for the Dutch phone line carrier in 2013 after negotiations collapsed.

In response to the criticism, Slim has stated, &quot;When you live for others&#x27; opinions, you are dead. I don&#x27;t want to live thinking about how I&#x27;ll be remembered [by Mexican people],&quot; claiming indifference about his position on Forbes list of the world&#x27;s richest people. He has said he has no interest in becoming the world&#x27;s richest person. When asked to explain his sudden increase in wealth at a press conference soon after Forbes annual rankings were published, he said, &quot;The stock market goes up ... and down&quot;, and noted that his fortune could quickly drop.

In 2016, then presidential candidate and eventual 45th President of the United States Donald Trump accused Slim of being involved in editorial articles critical of him published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; during his 2016 presidential campaign. The Times responded to these accusations by saying that Slim had never interfered in editorial policy. Later in 2017, Trump and Slim met in person. Slim spoke positively about the meeting.

== Philanthropy ==
Slim has been publicly skeptical of The Giving Pledge by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett giving away at least half of their fortunes. But—according to his spokesman—he devoted , or roughly 5%, to his Carlos Slim foundation as of 2011. Though Slim has not gone as far as Gates and Buffett in pledging more than half of his fortune, Slim has expressed firm support for philanthropy and has advised budding entrepreneurs that businessmen must do more than givethey &quot;should participate in solving problems&quot;.

In 2019, Forbes put Slim in the list of the world&#x27;s most generous philanthropists outside of the US.

=== &quot;Fundación Carlos Slim&quot; ===
Established in 1986, &quot;Fundación Carlos Slim&quot; sponsors the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City, named after Slim&#x27;s late wife, Soumaya Domit, opened 2011. It holds 66,000 pieces, including religious relics, contains the world&#x27;s second-largest collection of Rodin sculptures, including &quot;The Kiss&quot;, the largest Salvador Dalí collection in Latin America, works by Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and coins from the viceroys of Spain. The inauguration in 2011 was attended by the President of Mexico, Nobel Prize laureates, writers and other celebrities.

After stating that he had donated of dividends to &quot;Fundación Carlos Slim&quot;, in 2006, and another in 2010, Slim was ranked fifth in Forbes&#x27; World&#x27;s Biggest Givers in May 2011. Education and health care projects have included $100 million to perform 50,000 cataract surgeries in Peru.

=== &quot;Fundación Telmex&quot; ===
In 1995, Slim established &quot;Fundación Telmex&quot;, a broad-ranging philanthropic foundation, which as he announced in 2007 had been provided with an asset base of to establish &quot;Carso Institutes for Health, Sports and Education&quot;. Furthermore, it was to work in support of an initiative of Bill Clinton to aid the people of Latin America. The foundation has organized Copa Telmex, an amateur sports tournament, recognized in 2007 and 2008 by Guinness World Records as having the most participants of any such tournament in the world. Together with Fundación Carlos Slim Helú, Telmex announced in 2008 that it was to invest more than in Mexican sports programs, from grass-roots level to Olympic standard. Telmex sponsored the Sauber F1 team for the 2011 season. Telmex donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.

=== &quot;Fundación del Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México A.C.&quot; ===
Slim has been Chair of the Council for the Restoration of the Historic Downtown of Mexico City since 2001.

In 2011, he, along with the president of Mexico, Mexico City mayor, and Mexico City archbishop, inaugurated the first phase of Plaza Mariana close to Basilica de Guadalupe. The complex, whose construction was funded by Slim, includes an evangelization center, museum, columbarium, health center, and market.

<text>HMS &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named in honour of the Battle of St. Kitts which took place in 1782. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited on the Tyne. She was launched on 4 October 1944 and commissioned on 21 January 1946.

==Service==
&quot;St. Kitts&quot; joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet upon commission. In 1948, &quot;St. Kitts&quot; deployed to the Arctic to join the aircraft carrier , along with a variety of other ships, including other Battle-class destroyers during experiments in that region. In 1953, &quot;St. Kitts&quot; took part in the large Fleet Review at Spithead to celebration the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and . &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was subsequently placed in Reserve.

In 1954, &quot;St. Kitts&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, also part of the Home Fleet. In 1955, &quot;St. Kitts&quot;, still with the 3rd Flotilla, deployed to the Mediterranean, and took part in the Suez Crisis, which had occurred after the nationalisation of the Suez Canal by the Egyptian leader Nasser. During Operation Musketeer, the invasion of Egypt, &quot;St. Kitts&quot; performed a variety of duties, including escorting the carrier , as well as participating in the naval bombardment of Port Said. That same year, &quot;St. Kitts&quot;, along with the rest of the Flotilla, left the Mediterranean to join the Home Fleet.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In 1957, &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was decommissioned, being scrapped in 1962 at Sunderland.

<doc id="629870" wikidata="Q2742723" url="?curid=629870" title="Great Flood of 1993">
<text>The Great Flood of 1993 (or Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993) was a flood that occurred in the Midwestern United States, along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries, from April to October 1993.

The flood is among the most costly and devastating to ever occur in the United States, with 50 dead and US$12–16billion in damages (equivalent to $–billion in ). The hydrographic basin affected an area approximately totaling , of about in length and about in width. Within this zone, the flooded area totaled around and was the worst such U.S. disaster since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, as measured by duration, area inundated, persons displaced, crop and property damage, and number of record river levels. In some categories, the 1993 flood even surpassed the 1927 flood, at the time the largest flood ever recorded on the Mississippi River.

==Causes and progression==

A volcanic winter is thought to have started with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. It has been suggested that excess cloud condensation nuclei from the eruption were responsible for the Great Flood of 1993 in the Midwestern United States.

Above-normal rainfall and below-normal temperatures beginning in the summer of 1992 resulted in above-normal soil moisture and reservoir levels in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi River basins. This weather pattern persisted throughout the following autumn. During the winter of 1992–93, the region experienced heavy snowfall. These conditions were followed by persistent spring weather patterns that produced storms over the same locations. Soils across much of the affected area were saturated by June 1, with additional rainfall all running off into streams and rivers, instead of soaking into the ground. These wet-weather conditions contrasted sharply with the droughts and heat waves experienced in the southeastern United States.

Storms, persistent and repetitive in nature during the late spring and summer, crowded the Upper Midwest with voluminous rainfall. Portions of east-central Iowa received as much as of rain between April 1 and August 31, 1993, and many areas across the central-northern plains had precipitation 400–750% above normal. In the St. Louis National Weather Service (NWS) forecast area encompassing eastern Missouri and southwest Illinois, 36 forecast points rose above flood stage, and 20 river-stage records were broken. The 1993 flood broke record river levels set during the 1973 Mississippi and the 1951 Missouri River floods.

Civil Air Patrol crews from 21 states served more than 5,000 meals to flood victims and volunteers, and their pilots logged more than 1,500 hours in the air inspecting utility lines and pipelines.

Over 1,000 flood warnings and statements, five times the normal, were issued to notify the public and need-to-know officials of river levels. In such places as St. Louis, river levels were nearly above flood stage, the highest ever recorded there in 228 years. The -high St. Louis Floodwall, built to handle the volume of the 1844 flood, was able to keep the 1993 flood out with just over to spare. This floodwall was built in the 1960s, to great controversy, out of interlocking prefabricated concrete blocks.

Emergency officials estimated that nearly all of the 700 privately built agricultural levees were overtopped or destroyed along the Missouri River. Navigation on the Mississippi and Missouri River had been closed since early July, resulting in a loss of $2 million (1993) per day in commerce.

James Scott, a 23-year-old Illinois man, was convicted in 1994 for &quot;intentionally causing a catastrophe&quot; and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in causing some of the flooding across the river from Quincy, Illinois. In an attempt to strand his wife on the other side of the river so he could continue partying, Scott allegedly removed several sandbags from a levee holding back the water. The breach flooded of farmland, destroyed buildings, and closed a bridge. His conviction was overturned in 1997, but reinstated in 1998. He maintains his innocence behind bars.

===May===
The Redwood River in Minnesota began experiencing severe flooding in May. On May 22, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, received of rain in a three-hour period. From May through July, Sioux Falls, South Dakota received of rain, the wettest three-month period in its history.

===June===
As noted above, rains in South Dakota contributed to flooding downstream. In June, flooding occurred along the Black River in Wisconsin, with flooding also starting to occur along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Kansas rivers. Starting as early as June 7, reports of levees being overtopped and levee breaks became common. These breaches acted to delay the flood crests, temporarily storing excess water in the adjacent lowlands, but the rain kept falling.
In the beginning of June, the Missouri and Mississippi rivers dropped below flood stage and were receding. During the second week of June, river levels rose to near flood stage before yet again beginning their slow recession. By the end of June, the Mississippi River was below flood stage at St. Louis, while many other river locations in the region were near flood stage. Precipitation for the month averaged from above normal in Kansas City, to nearly above normal in Springfield, Missouri.

===July===
July brought more heavy rain to the Missouri and upper Mississippi River basins in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Illinois, and Minnesota. Rainfall amounts of in 24 hours were common. Precipitation for the month averaged from above normal at St. Louis and Springfield, to between above normal at Columbia and Kansas City, Missouri.
In Iowa, the flood waters brought mass destruction. On July 9, four buildings on Iowa State University&#x27;s campus flooded; resulting in over 1.4 million dollars in estimated damages and six weeks of construction to reopen. The college&#x27;s indoor sports arena, Hilton Coliseum, was flooded with as much as fourteen feet of water. From July 11 until July 22, the Des Moines Water Works was flooded by the Raccoon River. This resulted in the plant being powered down, unable to provide running water for that period. On July 13, electricity returned to more than 35,000 residents. That same day President Bill Clinton toured Iowa&#x27;s capitol and neighboring cities alongside Governor Terry Branstad. He later declared a state of disaster for Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri and asked Congress to approve 2.5 billion dollars in Federal disaster relief. During this time the Army National Guard and American Red Cross set up water stations, and the local Anheuser-Busch distributor contributed water in white six-packs with their logo on it. Once running water was restored, there was enough pressure for people to bathe and flush toilets, but the water was not certified potable until July 29. The final usage restrictions were lifted in August.

Major sandbagging activities took place along the higher Missouri River, the River des Peres in St. Louis, the Mississippi River south of St. Louis, and on many other tributaries across Missouri and Illinois. Some of these efforts were successful, while others were not. The copious rain during July sent record-setting crests down the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, causing river gauges to malfunction along the way. The record crests met within days of each other at their confluence near St. Louis. Navigation on the Mississippi and Missouri River was closed in early July, resulting in a loss of $2 million (1993) per day in commerce.

Mississippi River levels stabilized for a few days at April 1973 record stages. When the crest from the Missouri River arrived, levels rose again. The Mississippi River broke through levees, drove people and their possessions to higher ground, and caused havoc through the floodplains.

The crests, now combined as one, moved downstream through St. Louis on the way to the Upper Mississippi&#x27;s confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois. Only minor flooding occurred below Cairo due to the Lower Mississippi&#x27;s larger channel below that point, as well as drought conditions in the eastern U.S. If the Ohio River watershed had not been in drought while the Missouri and Upper Mississippi were in flood, the 1993 flood might have rivaled the 1927 flood in overall damage on the Lower Mississippi, beyond Cairo.

===August===

On August 1, levee breaks near Columbia, Illinois, flooded of land, inundating the Illinois towns of Valmeyer and Fults. The released water continued to flow parallel to the river, approaching the levees protecting historic Prairie du Rocher and Fort de Chartres. On August 3, officials decided to break through the stronger Mississippi River levee to allow the water back into the river. The plan worked and the historic areas were saved, although some residential areas were flooded in counties above Prairie du Rocher.

The Mississippi River at St. Louis crested at on August 1, nearly above flood stage. It had a peak flow rate of 1,080,000 ft3/s (30,600 m3/s). At this rate, a bowl the size of Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis would be filled to the brim in 70 seconds.

==Costs and damage==
Some locations on the Mississippi River flooded for almost 200 days, while various regions by the Missouri neared 100 days of flooding. On the Mississippi, Grafton, Illinois, recorded flooding for 195 days; Clarksville, Missouri, for 187 days; Winfield, Missouri, for 183 days; Hannibal, Missouri, for 174 days; and Quincy, Illinois, for 152 days. The Missouri River was above flood stage for 62 days in Jefferson City, Missouri, 77 days at Hermann, Missouri, and for 94 days at St. Charles in the St. Louis metropolitan area. On October 7, 103 days after the flooding began, the Mississippi River at St. Louis finally dropped below flood stage. Approximately 100,000 homes were destroyed as a result of the flooding, of farmland inundated, and the whole towns of Valmeyer, Illinois, and Rhineland, Missouri, were relocated to higher ground.

Reports in 1994 set the deaths due to the flood at 38, though this had been revised to 50 deaths by 1996. The fiscal cost is estimated at $12–16 billion (equivalent to $–billion in ). Even after the water was gone, large amounts of sand still covered the farmlands and homes.

==Comparison with other major floods in Kansas City==

Over time, channeling and levee construction have altered how floods affect various areas along the Missouri River. For example, here is a comparison of flood data atand associated impacts onKansas City for three big floods since the early 19th century.

*Great Flood of 1844 – This was the biggest flood of the three in terms of rate of discharge at Westport Landing in Kansas City. It is estimated that was discharged in the flood. However, the crest on July 16, 1844, was almost a foot (0.3 m) lower than the 1993 flood.
*Great Flood of 1951 – The 1951 flood was the second biggest in terms of rate of discharge at . The crest on July 14, 1951, was almost lower than the 1844 flood and lower than 1993. However, the flood was the most devastating of all modern floods for Kansas City since its levee system was not built to withstand it. It destroyed the Kansas City Stockyards and caused Kansas City to build Kansas City International Airport away from the Missouri River bottoms to replace the heavily damaged Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Kansas.
*Great Flood of 1993 – The 1993 flood was the highest of any of the three but had the lowest rate of discharge at . While the 1993 flood had devastating impacts elsewhere, Kansas City survived it relatively well because of levee improvements after the 1951 flood.

<text>The Aberfan disaster () was the catastrophic collapse of a colliery spoil tip on 21 October 1966. The tip had been created on a mountain slope above the Welsh village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, and overlaid a natural spring. Heavy rain led to a build-up of water within the tip which caused it to suddenly slide downhill as a slurry, killing 116 children and 28 adults as it engulfed Pantglas Junior School and a row of houses. The tip was the responsibility of the National Coal Board (NCB), and the subsequent inquiry placed the blame for the disaster on the organisation and nine named employees.

There were seven spoil tips on the hills above Aberfan; Tip 7—the one that slipped onto the village—was started in 1958 and, at the time of the disaster, was high. In contravention of the NCB&#x27;s procedures, the tip was partly based on ground from which springs emerged. After three weeks of heavy rain the tip was saturated and approximately of spoil slipped down the side of the hill and onto the Pantglas area of the village. The main building hit was the local junior school, where lessons had just begun; 5 teachers and 109 children were killed.

An official inquiry was chaired by Lord Justice Edmund Davies. The report placed the blame squarely on the NCB. The organisation&#x27;s chairman, Lord Robens, was criticised for making misleading statements and for not providing clarity as to the NCB&#x27;s knowledge of the presence of water springs on the hillside. Neither the NCB nor any of its employees were prosecuted and the organisation was not fined.

The Aberfan Disaster Memorial Fund (ADMF) was established on the day of the disaster. It received nearly 88,000 contributions, totalling £1.75 million. The remaining tips were removed only after a lengthy fight by Aberfan residents against resistance from the NCB and the government on the grounds of cost. The site&#x27;s clearance was paid for by a government grant and a forced contribution of £150,000 taken from the memorial fund. In 1997 the British government paid back the £150,000 to the ADMF, and in 2007 the Welsh Government donated £1.5 million to the fund and £500,000 to the Aberfan Education Charity as recompense for the money wrongly taken. Many of the village&#x27;s residents developed medical problems as a result of the disaster, and half the survivors have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder at some time in their lives.

==Background==
Aberfan is situated toward the bottom of the western valley slope of the Taff Valley, on the eastern slope of Mynydd Merthyr, approximately south of Merthyr Tydfil. When the Merthyr Vale Colliery was sunk on 23 August 1869 by John Nixon and partners, Aberfan consisted of two cottages and an inn frequented by local farmers and bargemen. By 1966 its population had grown to approximately 5,000, most of whom were employed in the coal industry. Since the nationalisation of the British coal industry in 1947, Aberfan&#x27;s colliery had been under the control of the National Coal Board (NCB). Regulation in the coal industry was provided by HM Inspectorate of Mines. The inspectors had worked as engineers in the coal industry and were former employees of the NCB. The River Taff runs north-to-south through the village; at the upper side of the settlement, on the western outskirts, the bed of the disused Glamorganshire Canal and a disused railway embankment run parallel to the river.

The first spoil from the coal mine was deposited on the valley&#x27;s lower slopes, east of the canal, but during the 1910s the first tip was started on the western slopes, above the canal line and the village. By 1966 there were seven spoil heaps, comprising approximately of waste. Tips 4 and 5 were conical mounds at the apex of the slope, although Tip 4 was misshapen from an earlier slip; the remaining five were lower down; all were directly above the village. Tip 7 was the only one being used in 1966. About high, it contained of spoil, which included of tailings—waste from the chemical extraction of coal, fine particles of coal and ash which took on properties similar to quicksand when wet.

Tip stability is affected by water conditions. Tips 4, 5 and 7 had been sited on streams or springs. The presence of the springs was common knowledge in the area, and they had been marked on the Ordnance Survey and Geological Society maps since 1874. Tip 4 at Aberfan, which had been used between 1933 and 1945, was large, and had been started on boggy ground between two streams. At the time of its planning, the Merthyr Tydfil borough engineer thought that despite the position, it would be unlikely to avalanche. Following some ground movements in the tip in the early 1940s, a drainage channel was dug in early 1944. In November that year part of the tip slid down the mountain to stop approximately above the village. In May 1963 Tip 7 shifted slightly; in November that year there was a more substantial slide. The NCB stated that the movement had not been a &quot;slide&quot;, but was instead a &quot;tailings run&quot;—a run-off of tailings from the surface of the tip—which left its stability unaffected. After the slide, the NCB stopped tipping tailings on number 7, but normal spoil continued to be deposited.

Aberfan is in an area of relatively high rainfall, an average of a year. In 1960 it was , the heaviest of recent years in the run-up to the disaster. Between 1952 and 1965, there was severe flooding in the Pantglas area of Aberfan on at least 11 occasions. Residents complained that the flood water was black and left a greasy residue when it receded. Complaints had been made by residents to Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council, who corresponded with the NCB between July 1963 and March 1964 on the topic of the &quot;Danger from Coal Slurry being tipped at the rear of the Pantglas Schools&quot;. In early 1965 meetings were held between the council and the NCB at which the Board agreed to take action on the clogged pipes and drainage ditches that were the cause of the flooding. No action had been taken by October 1966 when the tip collapsed.

==Tip collapse==
During the first three weeks of October 1966 there were of rainfall, nearly half of which was in the third week. During the night of 20–21 October the peak of Tip 7 subsided by and the rails on which the spoil was transported to the top of the tip fell into the resulting hole. The spoil movement was discovered at 7:30am by the first members of the morning shift manning the heaps. One of the workers walked to the colliery to report the slip; he returned with the supervisor for the tips, and it was decided that no further work would be done that day, but that a new tipping position would be decided on the following week.
At 9:15am a significant amount of water-saturated debris broke away from tip 7 and flowed downhill at in waves high. G. M. J. Williams, a consultant engineer who gave evidence at the subsequent tribunal, stated that the 9:15 am movement:

Approximately of spoil slid down the mountain, destroying two farm cottages and killing the occupants. Around travelled across the canal and railway embankment and into the village. The flow destroyed two water mains buried in the embankment and the additional water further saturated the spoil. Those who heard the avalanche said the sound reminded them of a low-flying jet or thunder.

The avalanche struck Pantglas Junior School on Moy Road, demolishing and engulfing much of the structure and filling classrooms with thick mud, sludge and rubble; 109 children, from 240 attendees, and five teachers were killed in the school. The pupils of Pantglas Junior School had arrived only minutes earlier for the last day before the half-term holiday, which was due to start at 12 midday. The teachers had just begun to record the children&#x27;s attendance in the registers when the landslide hit. The adjacent secondary school was also damaged, and 18 houses on surrounding roads were destroyed. Mud and water from the slide flooded other houses in the vicinity, forcing many to evacuate their homes. Once the slide material had come to a halt, it re-solidified. A huge mound of slurry up to high blocked the area. The acting headmaster of the secondary school recalled:

Some staff died trying to protect the children. Nansi Williams, the school meals clerk, used her body to shield five children, who all survived; Williams did not, and was found by rescuers still holding a pound note she had been collecting as lunch money. Dai Beynon, the deputy headmaster, tried to use a blackboard to shield himself and five children from the slurry pouring through the school. He and all 34 pupils in his class were killed. When the avalanche stopped, so did the noise; one resident recalled that &quot;in that silence you couldn&#x27;t hear a bird or a child&quot;.

==Rescue efforts and retrieval of the bodies==

After the landslide stopped, local residents rushed to the school and began digging through the rubble, moving material by hand or with garden tools. At 9:25 am Merthyr Tydfil police received a phone call from a local resident who said &quot;I have been asked to inform that there has been a landslide at Pantglas. The tip has come down on the school&quot;; the fire brigade, based in Merthyr Tydfil, received a call at about the same time. Calls were then made to local hospitals, the ambulance service and the local Civil Defence Corps. The first miners from the Aberfan colliery arrived within 20 minutes of the disaster, having been raised from the coal seams where they had been working. They directed the early digging, knowing that unplanned excavation could lead to collapse of the spoil and the remnants of the buildings; they worked in organised groups under the control of their pit managers.

The first casualties from the wreckage of the school arrived at St Tydfil&#x27;s Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil at 9:50 am; the remaining rescued casualties all arrived before 11:00 am: 22 children, one of whom was dead on arrival, and 5 adults. A further 9 casualties were sent to the East Glamorgan General Hospital. No survivors were found after 11:00 am. Of the 144 people who died in the disaster, 116 were children, mostly between the ages of 7 and 10; 109 of the children died inside Pantglas Junior School. Five of the adults who died were teachers at the school. An additional 6 adults and 29 children were injured.

The 10:30 am BBC news summary led with the story of the disaster. The result was that thousands of volunteers travelled to Aberfan to help, although their efforts often hampered the work of the experienced miners or trained rescue teams.

With the two broken water mains still pumping water into the spoil in Aberfan, the slip continued to move through the village, and it was not until 11:30 am that the water authorities managed to turn off the supply. It was estimated that the mains added between of water to the spoil slurry. With movement in the upper slopes still a danger, at 12:00 noon NCB engineers began digging a drainage channel, with the aim of stabilising the tip. It took two hours to reroute the water to a safer place, from where it was diverted into an existing water course.

An NCB board meeting that morning, headed by the organisation&#x27;s chairman, Lord Robens, was informed of the disaster. It was decided that the NCB&#x27;s Director-General of Production and its Chief Safety Engineer should inspect the situation, and they left for the village immediately. In his autobiography, Robens stated that the decision for him not to go was because &quot;the appearance of a layman at too early a stage inevitably distracts senior and essential people from the tasks upon which they should be exclusively concentrating&quot;. Instead of visiting the scene, that evening Robens went to the ceremony to invest him as the chancellor of the University of Surrey. NCB officers covered for him when contacted by Cledwyn Hughes, the Secretary of State for Wales, falsely claiming that Robens was personally directing relief work.

Hughes visited the scene at 4:00 pm for an hour. He telephoned Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, and confirmed Wilson&#x27;s own thought that he should also visit. Wilson told Hughes to &quot;take whatever action he thought necessary, irrespective of any considerations of &#x27;normal procedures&#x27;, expenditure or statutory limitations&quot;. Wilson arrived at Aberfan at 9.40 pm, where he heard reports from the police and civil defence forces, and visited the rescue workers. Before he left, at midnight, he and Hughes agreed that a high-level independent inquiry needed to be held. That evening the mayor of Merthyr Tydfil launched an appeal for financial donations—soon formally named the Aberfan Disaster Fund—to alleviate financial hardship and to help rebuild the area.

A makeshift mortuary was set up in the village&#x27;s Bethania Chapel on 21 October and operated until 4 November, from the disaster site; members of the Glamorgan Constabulary force assisted with the identification and registration of the victims. Two doctors examined the bodies and issued death certificates; the cause of death was typically asphyxia, fractured skull or multiple crush injuries. Cramped conditions in the chapel meant that parents could only be admitted one at a time to identify the bodies of their children. The building also acted as a missing persons bureau and its vestry was used by Red Cross volunteers and St John Ambulance stretcher-bearers. Four hundred embalmers volunteered to assist with the cleaning and dressing of the corpses; a contingent that flew over from Northern Ireland removed the seats of their plane to transport child-sized coffins. The smaller Aberfan Calvinistic Chapel nearby was used as a second mortuary from 22 to 29 October.

By the morning of Saturday 22 October, 111 bodies had been recovered, of which 51 had been identified. At daybreak the Queen&#x27;s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon visited and spoke with workers and parents; at 11:00 am Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited the scene and talked to rescue workers. In the early afternoon light rain began falling, which became increasingly heavy; it caused further movement in the tip, which threatened the rescue work and raised the possibility that the area would have to be evacuated.

Robens arrived in Aberfan on Saturday evening. After visiting the colliery and the disaster site, he gave a press conference at which he stated that the NCB would work with any public inquiry. In an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, Robens said the organisation &quot;will not seek to hide behind any legal loophole or make any legal quibble about responsibility&quot;. Robens returned to the village the following morning to see the situation in daylight. He was interviewed by a television news team while examining the tip. When asked about the responsibility of the NCB for the slide, he answered:


On 23 October assistance was provided by the Territorial Army. This was followed by the arrival of naval ratings from and members of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment. That day Wilson announced the appointment of Lord Justice Edmund Davies as the chairman of the inquiry into the disaster; Davies had been born and schooled in the nearby village of Mountain Ash. A coroner&#x27;s inquest was opened on 24 October to give the causes of death for 30 of the children located. One man who had lost his wife and two sons called out when he heard their names mentioned: &quot;No, sir—buried alive by the National Coal Board&quot;; one woman shouted that the NCB had &quot;killed our children&quot;. The first funerals, for five of the children, took place the following day. A mass funeral for 81 children and one woman took place at Bryntaf Cemetery in Aberfan on 27 October. They were buried in a pair of trenches; 10,000 people attended.

Because of the vast quantity and consistency of the spoil, it was a week before all the bodies were recovered; the last victim was found on 28 October. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Aberfan on 29 October to pay their respects to those who had died. Their visit coincided with the end of the main rescue phase; only one contracting firm remained in the village to continue the last stages of the clear-up.

==Aftermath==
===Aberfan Disaster Tribunal===

On 25 October 1966, after resolutions in both Houses of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Wales formally appointed a tribunal to inquire into the disaster. Before the tribunal began, Elwyn Jones, the Attorney General, cautioned the media that commenting on matters to be investigated by the tribunal could lay them open to the same consequences as contempt of court. Sitting alongside Lord Justice Davies on the inquiry were the civil engineer Harold Harding and Vernon Lawrence, the former Clerk to the Monmouthshire County Council. The inquiry had an initial public meeting on 2 November 1966 and took evidence in public for 76 days, spread over the next five months; during that time 136 witnesses testified. The tribunal report stated &quot;much of the time of the Tribunal could have been saved if ... the National Coal Board had not stubbornly resisted every attempt to lay the blame where it so clearly must rest—at their door&quot;.

Aberfan&#x27;s MP, S. O. Davies, gave evidence to the tribunal and stated that he had long held concerns that the tip &quot;might not only slide, but in sliding might reach the village&quot;; he added that he had not spoken out because he had &quot;more than a shrewd suspicion that that colliery would be closed&quot;. Brian Gibbens, QC, the counsel for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), challenged Davies&#x27;s evidence and stated that if the testament &quot;is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection ... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster&quot;. Gibbens requested that Davies&#x27;s testimony be rejected, on the basis that he &quot;never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words&quot;. The tribunal agreed, and stated that &quot;we doubt that he fully understood the grave implication of what he was saying&quot;.

Initially the tribunal decided not to call Robens to testify—they took his comment to the media about the existence of the spring being unknown as hearsay, and thought that his evidence could not help. The counsel for the families, Desmond Ackner, QC, strongly criticised Robens for making the statement about the spring, saying it was &quot;a public scandal&quot;; he added that &quot;at no stage throughout this Inquiry has the National Coal Board taken the initiative to correct this sentence&quot;. Ackner also criticised Robens&#x27;s absence from the inquiry, saying that &quot;no explanation has been proffered by or on behalf of Lord Robens and his absence, therefore, and in this regard has been conspicuous.&quot; The tribunal members decided that Robens should be able to defend his position and he was invited to attend. Under cross-examination by Ackner, Robens gave evidence inconsistent with that provided by the NCB, particularly on the point of whether the disaster was foreseeable; counsel for the organisation asked the tribunal to ignore Robens&#x27;s testimony.

The tribunal concluded its hearings on 28 April 1967 and published its report on 3 August. Among their findings was that &quot;[b]lame for the disaster rests upon the National Coal Board. ... This blame is shared (though in varying degrees) among the National Coal Board headquarters, the South Western Divisional Board, and certain individuals.&quot; They added that the &quot;legal liability of the National Coal Board to pay compensation for the personal injuries (fatal or otherwise) and damage to property is incontestable and uncontested&quot;. In its introduction the inquiry team wrote that it was their

Nine employees of the NCB were censured by the inquiry, with &quot;many degrees of blameworthiness, from very slight to grave&quot;, although McLean and Johnes consider that some senior staff whom the evidence shows to have been culpable were omitted, and one junior member of staff named in the report should not have been blamed. The tribunal decided that no blame lay with Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council or the NUM.

The tribunal made several recommendations, including the need for the extension of the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 to cover tips, and the formation of a National Tip Safety Committee to advise the government. The inquiry report also advised that &quot;action needs to be taken to safeguard the future condition of the tips at Aberfan&quot;.

The sociologist Barry Turner, in a 1976 study, identified several errors that led to the Aberfan disaster. These included years of rigid and unrealistic disregard for the importance of the safety of the above-ground tips (as opposed to dangers within the mines); a flawed decision-making process which ignored or minimised the likelihood and the scale of the emergent danger; a dismissive attitude toward the complaints from Aberfan residents, discounting the validity of their concerns; and an incomplete and inadequate response to conditions which caused those complaints.

McLean and Johnes observe that HM Inspectorate of Mines went largely unchallenged by the tribunal, although the two consider that the organisation failed in their duty; in doing so, they created a situation of regulatory capture, where rather than protecting the public interest—in this case the citizens of Aberfan—their regulatory failures fell in line with the interests of the NCB, the organisation they were supposed to be overseeing.

===Aberfan residents===

During the rescue, the shock and grief of parents and villagers was exacerbated by insensitive behaviour from the media—one rescue worker recalled hearing a press photographer asking a child to cry for her dead friends because it would make a good picture. The response of the general public in donating to the memorial fund, together with over 50,000 letters of condolence that accompanied many of the donations, helped many residents come to terms with the disaster. One bereaved mother said &quot;People all over the world felt for us. We knew that with their letters and the contributions they sent ... They helped us build a better Aberfan.&quot;

A study published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; (BJP) in 2003 found that half the survivors of the disaster had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some time in their lives, that they were more than three times more likely to have developed lifetime PTSD than a comparison group of individuals who had experienced other life-threatening traumas, and that 34 per cent of survivors who took part in the study reported that they still experienced bad dreams or difficulty sleeping because of intrusive thoughts about the disaster. In 2005 Imperial Tobacco settled out of court to end an unfair dismissal suit brought against the company by an Aberfan survivor, who had been employed by the company&#x27;s Rizla cigarette paper factory near Pontypridd. She had been sacked after she refused to continue working night shifts, stating that it had brought on flashbacks from 1966, when she had been buried waist-deep in the landslide while walking to school. She survived, but a friend who had been walking with her was killed.

The BJP study also found that there was no significant rise in the risk of depression or substance abuse in survivors. Some parents of deceased children reported extreme feelings of guilt, as did the pupils who survived, one of whom reported:

The residents of Aberfan experienced medical problems after the disaster. Many survivors reported having &quot;sleeping difficulties, nervousness, lack of friends, unwillingness to go to school and enuresis&quot;. In the year following the tip slide, close relatives of the victims had a death rate seven times higher than the norm. One local doctor later wrote &quot;By every statistic, patients seen, prescriptions written, deaths, I can prove that this is a village of excessive sickness.&quot; Despite these problems, during the five years after the disaster the birth rate rose considerably, in marked contrast to that of Merthyr Tydfil.

===NCB and its personnel===
The NCB as an organisation was not prosecuted, and no NCB staff were demoted, sacked or prosecuted as a consequence of the Aberfan disaster or for evidence given to the inquiry. During a parliamentary debate on the disaster, Margaret Thatcher—then the opposition spokeswoman on power—raised the situation of one witness, criticised by the inquiry, who had subsequently been promoted to a board-level position at the NCB by the time the report was published.

In 2000 Iain McLean, a professor of politics, and Martin Johnes, a research fellow in Welsh history, undertook a study of the Aberfan disaster and its repercussions; their work included government papers released in 1997 under the thirty-year rule. Their opinion is that &quot;the Coal Board &#x27;spin-doctored&#x27; its way out of trouble, controlling the public agenda from the day of the disaster until the tips were finally removed&quot;. Robens had received a copy of the inquiry report ten days before its official publication and began a campaign to strengthen his position. He went on a tour of British coalfields, giving speeches that promoted the use of coal and criticised the increasing popularity of nuclear power. All messages of support to him were catalogued by the NCB, and copies of some were leaked to the press; the manoeuvring led to criticism in an editorial in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which stated that &quot;the Coal Board&#x27;s behaviour has ... been rather unseemly in the circumstances&quot;.

In August 1967—following the publication of the inquiry report—Robens discussed his position with the Minister of Power, Richard Marsh. After receiving assurances that his role at the NCB was secure, he offered to resign; in line with the agreement between the two men, the offer was rejected. In parliament, the Welsh MP Leo Abse said that &quot;when I saw what I regarded as the graceless pavane danced by Lord Robens and the Minister, as the Chairman of the Coal Board coyly offered his resignation and, equally coyly, the Minister rejected the offer, I thought that it was a disgraceful spectacle&quot;.

Initially the NCB offered bereaved families £50 in compensation, but this was raised to £500 for each bereaved family; the organisation called the amount &quot;a good offer and a &#x27;generous donation&#x27;&quot;. Many families thought the amount insufficient and petitioned the NCB for an increase; NCB insurance staff advised Robens that &quot;it is only the hard core [of bereaved parents] who are trying to capitalize&quot;.

===Disaster fund===
The fund set up by the mayor of Merthyr Tydfil grew rapidly, and within a few months nearly 88,000 contributions had been received, totalling £1,606,929; the final total raised was £1.75 million. No specific aims for the fund had been outlined by the mayor until it was put on a firm legal footing under the auspices of a permanent committee with clear local representation. They drew up a deed that outlined the purposes of the fund as:


In 1967 the Charity Commission advised that any money paid to the parents of bereaved families would be against the terms of the trust deed. After arguments from lawyers for the trust, they agreed that there was an &quot;unprecedented emotional state&quot; surrounding Aberfan, and suggested that sums of no more than £500 should be paid. Members of the trust told the commission that £5,000 was to be paid to each family; the commission agreed that the amount was permissible, but stated that each case should be examined before payment &quot;to ascertain whether the parents had been close to their children and were thus likely to be suffering mentally&quot;, according to one member of the Charity Commission. In November 1967 the commission threatened to remove trustees of the disaster fund or make a financial order against them if they made grants to parents of children who were physically uninjured but who were suffering mentally—some surviving children complained of being afraid of the dark and loud noises, while some refused to sleep alone; the commission informed them that any payments would be &quot;quite illegal&quot;. The decision affected 340 physically uninjured children.

Other grants made by the trust were less controversial: for those who lost their house, or whose property suffered significant damage, the trust donated £100 to assist with evacuation, and additional funds to help replace damaged effects. £100,000 was set aside for the future needs of the eight children physically injured in the disaster, and £5,000 was placed in trust for them for when they came of age. The charity funded the building of a community centre in the village and a memorial garden, which was opened by the Queen in March 1973. The garden is on the site of Pantglas Junior School and includes stone walls to show where the classrooms stood.

McLean and Johnes consider that &quot;the Commission protected neither donors nor beneficiaries. It was caught between upholding an outdated and inflexible law ... and fulfilling the varied expectations of donors, beneficiaries and the fund&#x27;s management committee&quot;. In a study of the fund, the UK government Cabinet Office judged that &quot;as far the fund is concerned and what it achieved, it is important to note that it did help in alleviating the suffering and was a focus for the grief of many&quot;. In 1988 the Aberfan Disaster Fund was separated into two entities: the Aberfan Memorial Charity and the Aberfan Disaster Fund and Centre, the second of which is administered by Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. The Aberfan Memorial Charity oversees the upkeep of the memorial garden and Bryntaf Cemetery, and provides financial assistance to &quot;all those who have suffered as a result of the Aberfan Disaster by making grants of money or providing or paying for items, services or facilities calculated to reduce the need, hardship or distress of such persons&quot;.

===Remaining tips and the fund===
The tribunal report quoted one expert who said that Tip 5 &quot;has been standing and is standing at a very low factor of safety&quot;; the quote was read out by Thatcher in the October 1967 parliamentary debate on the inquiry report. S. O. Davies spoke in the debate on the same point:

The residents of Aberfan petitioned George Thomas, who had succeeded Hughes as Secretary of State for Wales in April 1968, for the tips to be removed; they entered the Welsh Office and left a small pile of coal slurry on the table in front of him to make their point; Thomas later stated the tips &quot;constitute a psychological, emotional danger&quot; to the people of Aberfan. The NCB had received a range of estimated costs for removing the tips, from £1.014 million to £3.4 million. Robens informed HM Treasury that the cost would be £3 million, and informed them that the NCB would not pay for the removal; between November 1967 and August he lobbied to avoid having the NCB pay. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury also refused to pay, and said that the costs were too high. Although the government had initially favoured landscaping—an option cheaper than removal—they were eventually persuaded that removal was preferable.

To pay for the removal of the tips, £150,000 was taken from the disaster fund—lowered from the initial £250,000 first requested—the NCB paid £350,000 and the government provided the balance, with the proviso it was only up to a million. The final cost of the removal was £850,000. The trustees of the fund voted to accept the request for payment after realising that there was no alternative if they wanted the tips removed. S. O. Davies, the only member of the committee to vote against the payment, resigned in protest. There was a reminder of the danger for the residents of Aberfan when, in August 1968, heavy rain caused slurry to be washed down the village&#x27;s streets. At the time, the Charity Commission made no objection to this action; the political scientists Jacint Jordana and David Levi-Faur consider the payment &quot;unquestionably unlawful&quot; under charity law.

===Legislation===
In 1969, as a result of concerns raised by the disaster, and in line with the findings of the tribunal report, the government framed new legislation to remedy the absence of laws and regulations governing mine and quarry spoil tips. The long title of the Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969 was &quot;An Act to make further provision in relation to tips associated with mines and quarries; to prevent disused tips constituting a danger to members of the public; and for purposes connected with those matters&quot;. The Act was an extension of the earlier Mines and Quarries Act 1954, which did not legislate over tips. According to McLean and Johnes, &quot;the general commitment to public safety that the Tribunal had envisaged was not implemented&quot; through the act, as the tribunal had advised wider legislation that should &quot;consider the safety, health and welfare of all persons going about their lawful business in the vicinity of a mine, including the safety of their property&quot;.

In May 1970 Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity, appointed Robens to chair the Committee on Health and Safety at Work, to review legislation in the area and recommend the provisions that should be made for workers and the general public. In 1972 the committee published its findings in the Robens Report which led to the creation of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the formation of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive.

==Legacy==

In addition to news and historical coverage, the Aberfan disaster and its aftermath have been described in books, including histories of what happened, personal memoirs from those involved and collections of poetry, in music, song and on screen.

Merthyr Vale Colliery closed in 1989. In 1997 Ron Davies, the Secretary of State for Wales in the incoming Labour government, repaid to the disaster fund the £150,000 that it had been induced to contribute towards the cost of tip removal. No allowance was made for inflation or the interest that would have been earned over the intervening period, which would have been £1.5 million in 1997. The payment was made in part after Iain McLean&#x27;s examination of the papers released by the government. In February 2007 the Welsh Government announced a donation of £1.5 million to the Aberfan Memorial Charity and £500,000 to the Aberfan Education Charity, which represented an inflation-adjusted amount of the money taken. The money to the memorial charity was used in the upkeep of the memorials to the disaster.

In May 1997 the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh planted a tree at the Aberfan Memorial Garden. In October 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of the disaster, memorial events took place at the garden and at the cemetery; the Prince of Wales represented the Queen, and government ministers were present to pay tribute. At the time of the anniversary Huw Edwards, the BBC News journalist and presenter, described the need to continue learning lessons from Aberfan; he wrote:

In August 2021 a memorial sculpture by the Welsh artist Nathan Wyburn was installed at the Rhondda Heritage Museum. In January 2022 there was a call to find a permanent home for the artefacts salvaged from the disaster. These included a clock which had stopped at the exact moment the disaster occurred. In February of the same year, the cemetery, together with the memorial garden and the area of the tip and its slide path, were listed on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. The record of the Grade II* site describes it as being of &quot;great national importance and meaning&quot;.

<doc id="629881" wikidata="Q2395310" url="?curid=629881" title="Mouse keys">
<text>Mouse keys is a feature of some graphical user interfaces that uses the keyboard (especially numeric keypad) as a pointing device (usually replacing a mouse). Its roots lie in the earliest days of visual editors when line and column navigation was controlled with arrow keys.
Today, mouse keys usually refers to the numeric keypad layout standardized with the introduction of the X Window System in 1984.

==Layout==

==History==

Historically, MouseKeys supported GUI programs when many terminals had no dedicated pointing device. As pointing devices became ubiquitous, the use of mouse keys narrowed to situations where a pointing device was missing, unusable, or inconvenient. Such situations may arise from the following:
*precision requirements (e.g., technical drawing)
*disabled user or ergonomics issues
*environmental limits (e.g., vibration in car or plane)
*broken/missing/unavailable equipment

In 1987, Macintosh Operating System 4.2 Easy Access provided MouseKeys support to all applications. Easy access was (de)activated by clicking the key five times.

By the early 2020s, with graphics tablets becoming more common, a configuration change may be required before enabling MouseKeys.

==MouseKeysAccel==

The X Window System MouseKeysAccel control applies action (usually cursor movement) repeatedly while a direction key {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} remains depressed. When the key is depressed, an &quot;action_delta&quot; is immediately applied. If the key remains depressed, longer than &quot;mk_delay&quot; milliseconds, some action is applied every &quot;mk_interval&quot; milliseconds until the key is released. If the key remains depressed, after more than &quot;mk_time_to_max&quot; actions have been applied, &quot;action_delta&quot; magnified &quot;mk_max_speed&quot; times, is applied every &quot;mk_interval&quot; milliseconds.

The first &quot;mk_time_to_max&quot; actions increase smoothly according to an exponential.

formula_1

These five parameters are configurable.

==Enabling==

Under the X Window Systems X.Org and XFree86 used on Unix-like systems such as Linux, BSD, and AIX, MouseKeys (and MouseKeysAccel), when available, is nominally (de)activated by ++. MouseKeys without acceleration (also known as plot mode) is sometimes available with +. This is nominally independent of the window manager in use, but may be overridden, or even made unavailable by a configuration file.

Before enabling, it may be necessary to change system configuration. The setxkbmap utility can be used to change the configuration under Xorg:

codice_1

There are also various utilities to allow more precise control via user-configurable key bindings, such as xmousekeys and xdotool.

Since KDE 5, MouseKeys is enabled and configured by systemsetting5 (Hardware → Input Devices → Mouse → Keyboard Navigation)

MouseKeys for Apple Inc.&#x27;s macOS is enabled and configured via the Accessibility ([apple] → System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse &amp; Trackpad).

Microsoft changed the method of enabling between Windows 2000, Windows XP (added diagonal cursor movement and MouseKeysAccel), and Windows Vista.

==Common usage==
===Replacing the mouse keys===
Replacing the mouse keys by the numeric keypad is as follows:
Typing (with the numeric keypad) is equivalent to clicking the selected button. By default, the selected button is the primary button (nominally under index finger, left button for most right-handed people and right button for most left-handed people). Typing (with the numeric keypad) selects the alternate button (nominally under ring finger, right button for most right-handed people and left button for most left-handed people). Typing (with the numeric keypad) selects the modifier button (nominally under the middle finger, middle button of a 3-button mouse). Typing (with the numeric keypad) selects the primary button. The selection remains in effect until a different button is selected.

Assignment of left/middle/right button to primary/modifier/alternate, alternate/modifier/primary, or something else is settable by many means. Some mice have a switch, that swaps assignment of right and left keys. Many laptop bioses have a setting for mouse button assignment. Many window managers have a setting that permutes the assignment. Within the X Window System core protocol, permutation can be applied by xmodmap.

===Moving the pointer by keys===

Other than , all other numeric keys from the numeric keypad are used to move the pointer on the screen. For example, will move the pointer upwards, while will move it diagonally downwards to the left.

<doc id="629882" wikidata="Q139414" url="?curid=629882" title="Zachariah Chandler">
<text>Zachariah Chandler (December 10, 1813 – November 1, 1879) was an American businessman, politician, and one of the founders of the Republican Party, whose radical wing he dominated as a lifelong abolitionist. He was mayor of Detroit, a four-term senator from the state of Michigan, and Secretary of the Interior under President Ulysses S. Grant.

As a successful young businessman in Detroit, Chandler supported the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War, he advocated for the Union war effort, the abolition of slavery, and civil rights for freed African Americans. As Secretary of the Interior, Chandler eradicated serious corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, fully endorsing President Grant&#x27;s Peace Policy initiative to civilize American Indian tribes. In 1879, he was re-elected U.S. Senator and was a potential presidential candidate, but he died the following morning after giving a speech in Chicago.

==Early life and career==
Zachariah Chandler was born in Bedford, New Hampshire, on December 10, 1813. His father was Samuel Chandler and his mother was Margaret Orr. Through an entirely paternal line, Samuel Chandler was a descendant of William Chandler who had migrated to Roxbury, Massachusetts, from England in 1637. Through this line he was the seventh generation of his family born in North America. Margaret Orr was the oldest daughter of military officer Col. John Orr. Chandler was educated in the common schools. Upon graduation, deciding not to attend college, Chandler moved west in 1833 to Detroit, at that time the capital of Michigan Territory. In Detroit, Chandler opened a general store and through trade, banking, and land speculation became one of the wealthiest men in the state of Michigan.

==Marriage and family==
On December 10, 1844, Chandler married Letitia Grace Douglas, a native of Baltimore, who moved to New York. A social entertainer, Letitia lived in Washington during the Winter throughout Chandler&#x27;s career. Chandler and Letitia had one daughter, Mary Douglas Chandler, who married Senator Eugene Hale of Maine. Chandler&#x27;s and Letitia&#x27;s grandchildren included Frederick Hale, who was a long-serving U.S. Senator from Maine, and Chandler Hale, who served as a U.S. diplomat in Rome. Letitia, known to have a &quot;gentle and kindly disposition&quot; and to be &quot;much beloved,&quot; died on February 19, 1899.

==Political career==
From his youth, Chandler had been strongly opposed to slavery and hoped that the Northern Whig party would be able to stop Southern slave power from spreading slavery into the Western Territories. Chandler financially supported the Detroit Underground Railroad, which helped fugitive or runaway slaves find safe haven.

In 1848 Chandler began his political career by making campaign speeches for the Whig Party presidential candidate Zachary Taylor. In 1851, Chandler was elected Mayor of Detroit and served one year in office. In 1852, Chandler ran as a Whig candidate for the Governor of Michigan, but he was defeated. Having supported Kansas as a free state without slavery, Chandler signed a petition that formed the Republican Party on July 6, 1854. In 1856, Chandler was a delegate at the first Republican Party National convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was a member of the Republican National Committee. The Republican Convention that year nominated John C. Frémont for president, known as &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, who wanted to rid Kansas of African American slavery and opposed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.

==U.S. Senator (1857–1875)==
In January 1857, Chandler ran as a Republican and was elected as a U.S. Senator for Michigan, succeeding Lewis Cass. Chandler was reelected in 1863 and again in 1869, serving from March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1875, in the 35th through the 43rd U.S. Congresses. In the Senate Chandler allied himself with the anti-slavery Radicals, although he opposed Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner. Chandler was the most outspoken Senator against secession. From March 1861 to 1875 Chandler was chairman of the &quot;Committee on Commerce&quot; that controlled powerful &quot;pork barrel&quot; appropriations for rivers and harbors. At the outbreak of the Civil War Chandler used his Senatorial influence to raise and equip the Michigan volunteers. Chandler was a member of the &quot;Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.&quot;

On July 6, 1862, Chandler castigated General George McClellan&#x27;s prosecution of the war in a speech at Jackson, Michigan. Chandler regarded his speech against McClellan as one of his most important public services. Chandler&#x27;s attack on McClellan came five days after McClellan failed to capture Richmond and the withdrawal of Union troops by McClellan to the James River during the Seven Days Battle that resulted in Confederate victory. On March 3, 1863, Chandler authored legislation for the collection and administration of abandoned property in the South. On July 2, 1864, Chandler authored legislation for the regulation of intercourse with the insurrectionist Confederate states.

Chandler supported higher tariff rates, the creation of a national bank, and voted for greenbacks as an emergency war measure, but strongly condemned any inflation of the currency. Chandler supported Reconstruction Acts that gave civil rights to African Americans but criticized reconstruction for being too lax. On January 5, 1866, Chandler authored a resolution for non-intercourse with Great Britain for refusing to negotiate the Alabama Claims, but this was rejected by the Senate. During the Civil War, Great Britain secretly allowed Confederate warships to be armed in British ports. These ships, including the &quot;CSS&quot; Alabama, did much to destroy Union commerce causing great monetary damage to the Union war effort. On November 29, 1867, in retaliation to Britain, Chandler submitted a resolution that Abyssinia be recognized as a belligerent nation at war against Great Britain, demanding that Abyssinia be given the &quot;same rights which the British had recognized to the Confederacy&quot; during the Civil War. During the election of 1868, Chandler was chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee.

Chandler was known as one of the Radical Republicans who pushed for harsher punishment for the former rebels, and greater liberties for African-Americans. After the war, he angrily stated that &quot;Every man who murdered and stole and poisoned was a Democrat&quot;.

During his entire Senate career, Chandler used his Senatorial federal patronage to increase his own political power. Chandler&#x27;s methods of obtaining power were considered &quot;openly partisan and despotic if not actually corrupt&quot; in obtaining control of the Republican machine in Michigan. Chandler was for many years Michigan&#x27;s undisputed Republican boss. The Democratic landslide during the election of 1874 broke his Senatorial power and he was defeated by Isaac P. Christiancy while seeking election for a fourth term when the Michigan legislature deadlocked.

==Secretary of Interior (1875–1877)==

Chandler was appointed Secretary of the Interior by President Ulysses S. Grant in October 1875 and served until 1877. In compliance with President Grant&#x27;s recommendations and authority, he implemented reforms in and reorganized the Department of the Interior during his tenure in office. The previous Secretary of the Interior, Columbus Delano, was not a reformer and had carelessly allowed profiteering to spread throughout the Interior Department. Secretary Chandler fired corrupt agents at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and fired and replaced the Indian Commissioner and Bureau Clerk. In addition, Secretary Chandler banned &quot;Indian Attorneys&quot; from the Interior Department, who swindled Indian tribes into paying for bogus representation in Washington D.C. Secretary Chandler fully endorsed President Grant&#x27;s Peace Policy initiative to civilize American Indian tribes. To assist in fighting corruption Chandler convinced President Grant to appoint reformers Charles T. Gorman of Michigan to Assistant Secretary of Interior and Augustus S. Gaylord Assistant Attorney-Generalship of the Department of Interior. These men were instrumental helping Chandler remove internal corruption from the Department of Interior. In February 1876 Chandler handed Indians who refused to leave their hunting grounds, concerning the encroachment in the Black Hills by miners, over to Secretary of War William W. Belknap&#x27;s department.

===Reformed Bureau of Indian Affairs===

When Chandler took office he found the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be the most corrupt out of the federal departments under his charge. Chandler replaced the Bureau&#x27;s Commissioner and the Chief Clerk. Chandler quietly investigated the Bureau and found corrupt appointees and suspicious practices by subordinates. Chandler ordered their removal, but the new commissioner said that these men were valuable to the Bureau, so Chandler held off firing the clerks. President Grant was following Chandler&#x27;s activities and asked why the corrupt clerks at the Bureau had not been fired. Chandler replied to Grant that the Commissioner said it would be impossible to run the Bureau without them. Grant, then ordered Chandler to fire the corrupt clerks even if that meant shutting down the Bureau. Chandler immediately went over to the Bureau and gave orders for the suspected clerks to be fired which was promptly enforced. This was the only time Grant was directly active in reforming a federal department. Grant continued to support Chandler in his reform efforts.

===Reformed Pension Bureau and Land Office===
In addition to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Chandler also thoroughly investigated the Pension Bureau. The investigation resulted in removing of fraudulent claims that saved the federal government hundreds of thousands of dollars. Within one month of his administration Chandler fired all Pension Bureau clerks involved in corruption. Chandler had Gaylord and Gorman to investigate the United States General Land Office whose investigation discovered there was a &quot;Chippewa half-breed scrip&quot; profiteering combination. Chandler broke up the combination and fired all of the members connected to the corrupt ring.

===Reformed Patent Office===
During his first month in office, Chandler fired all the clerks in one room of the Patent Office declaring every desk vacant believing all the clerks were involved in either corruption or lacked the integrity for reform. Chandler vacated the room and put in charge an African American porter to lock by key and keep people from entering the room until honest replacements were found. Chandler paid no attention to complaints and warned a man who believed he was fired unjustly not to complain to the press. Chandler without warning instigated an investigation by putting a new officer in charge of monthly payrolls of Patent Office employees taking the full names and addresses of everyone who signed them. Almost twenty employees were found to be fictitious created by a profiteering ring to defraud federal payroll monies. Chandler also exposed and removed corrupt unqualified clerks who profiteered by hiring out their work to underpaid replacements. Chandler simplified Patent Office rules making patents easier to obtain and lessening their costs to the public.

===Banned Indian Attorneys===
In December 1875 Chandler banned &quot;Indian Attorneys&quot;, persons who claimed to represent Indians in Washington, from the Department of Interior. Bogus &quot;agents&quot; induced Indian tribes to pay them $8.00 a day plus expenses in exchange for fraudulent legislative representation in Washington during the Winter months. Other agents would contract Indian land acquisition arrangements as security for payments. Preying on the fears of Indians, these &quot;attorneys&quot; would tell the Indians their tribal rights would be taken away in Washington if they did not accept their services. Chandler banned payment to these men for alleged services to Indians saying their claims or representation were illegal and immoral. Chandler declared, &quot;...the regularly-appointed Indian Agent, the Commission of Indian Affairs, and the Secretary of Interior are competent to protect and defend the rights of Indians in all respects...&quot; Chandler&#x27;s banning of &quot;Indian Attorneys&quot; saved the Indian tribes large amounts of money.

==Chairman of the Republican Party==

Chandler, as Chairman of the Republican National Committee, managed Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; successful 1876 campaign for the presidency, though Hayes declined to keep Chandler as Secretary of the Interior. He became Chairman of the Michigan Republican Party in 1878.

==U.S. Senator (1879)==
In 1879, he was again elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Isaac P. Christiancy, who had succeeded him just four years earlier. He served in the 45th and 46th Congresses from February 22, 1879, until his death later that year.

===Last speech and death===
Under consideration by party leaders as a possible candidate in the 1880 presidential election, Chandler went to Chicago to deliver a political speech on October 31, 1879. Maintaining his Radical roots, Chandler spoke in front of an African American Young Men&#x27;s Republican Auxiliary Club at McCormick Hall. Chandler said that he hoped one day blacks would be able to vote freely and safely, run for office, and make speeches throughout the nation including the South just as former rebels were allowed to vote, run for office, and speak in the North. Although he had earlier contracted a cold he was known to be his robust self that day. The next day he was found dead in one of his rooms at the Grand Pacific Hotel at 7:00 in the morning reclining on his bed. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

==Legacy==
When Chandler was appointed Secretary of Interior by President Grant in 1875, reformers were concerned that corruption and patronage in the department would continue as under Secretary Columbus Delano, Grant&#x27;s previous appointment. Chandler had a reputation as a wealthy Republican partisan political boss, rather than a reformer. However, these concerns proved unwarranted, as Chandler proved to be an efficient reformer. Chandler investigated corruption in his department and reported to President Grant, who gave him approval to launch reforms. He fired many in the department who were involved in corruption and fraud, and removed from the department persons known as &quot;Indian Attorneys.&quot;

<doc id="629888" wikidata="Q5518079" url="?curid=629888" title="Soup (Blind Melon album)">
<text>Soup is the second studio album by American rock band Blind Melon, released on August 15, 1995, through Capitol Records. It is the band&#x27;s last album released during the lifetime of vocalist Shannon Hoon.

&quot;Soup&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics and fared poorly commercially, with the album only reaching number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and going on to sell 217,000 copies in the United States by October 1996. Hoon&#x27;s death from a fatal drug overdose two months after the album&#x27;s release resulted in the album&#x27;s promotion being abruptly cut off, further affecting sales.

The album has retrospectively been considered a &quot;dark horse&quot; in the alternative rock genre.

==Background==
Thematically, the album is much darker than Blind Melon&#x27;s debut. &quot;2 X 4&quot; is about lead singer Shannon Hoon&#x27;s experience at a drug detox, while the lyrics to the acoustic ballad &quot;Walk&quot; cryptically reference his addiction and attempts to recovery. &quot;Skinned&quot; is about murderer Ed Gein. &quot;Car Seat (God&#x27;s Presents)&quot; is about Susan Smith, who killed her children by driving her car into a lake in Union, South Carolina. &quot;St. Andrew&#x27;s Fall&quot; is about a suicide the band allegedly witnessed in Detroit on tour. When asked about &quot;Mouthful of Cavities&quot;, Rogers Stevens said, &quot;It&#x27;s probably about the convoluted nooks and crannies of Shannon&#x27;s brain.&quot; It featured harmonies between Hoon and Jena Kraus. &quot;New Life&quot; is about the birth of Hoon&#x27;s daughter Nico Blue. &quot;Wilt&quot; is about halitosis. &quot;Galaxie&quot; uses the subject matter of Hoon&#x27;s 1963 Ford Galaxie to also explore the deeper themes of his first love and break-up. &quot;Lemonade&quot; is a humorous song about a bar fight.

In a 2015 interview with the Songfacts website, Christopher Thorn explained how purchasing a variety of instruments led to the writing of certain songs on the album. &quot;While writing songs for the &quot;Soup&quot; record, I was buying different instruments, and doing some songwriting experiments with them. I bought a banjo, so I wrote &#x27;Skinned&#x27; just for fun. I never imagined Shannon would choose to write lyrics over that music. It was odd and really just so I could learn how to play banjo.&quot;

In a 2013 interview with Songfacts, Brad Smith recalled, &quot;But Shannon, I think, meant every word that he said on the &quot;Soup&quot; record, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s maybe even more critically acclaimed than our first record. Our first record sold many, many more units than our second record, but the second record had a lot more critical acclaim to it. People recognize it as the truth and pure. And I think that&#x27;s the earmark of a great record.&quot;

==Album cover==
The producer of the album, Andy Wallace, is seen on the cover, eating alphabet soup. The letters in the soup spell out Blind Melon.

==Critical reception==
In issue 557 of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; (dated August 5, 1995), Paul Rees gave the album a &quot;4 K review&quot; (which means &quot;Klassik&quot;), saying, &quot;&quot;Soup&quot; - bold, barmy, and borderline great.&quot;

In the August 21, 1995, issue of &quot;People&quot;, Andrew Abrahams gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying, &quot;If Blind Melon&#x27;s eclectic approach sounds a bit maddening, it can be. But at least they&#x27;ve accomplished an important task: establishing a musical life beyond the Bee Girl.&quot;

In issue 716 of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (dated September 7, 1995), Ted Drozdowski gave a scathing review of the album, ending his write-up with the statement, &quot;With such slight fare to offer – and no kid in a bee suit – &quot;Soup&quot; puts Blind Melon in hot water.&quot;

Also in 1995, &quot;Soup&quot; was ranked number 13 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; list, above releases by the likes of Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Green Day, Ozzy Osbourne, and AC/DC.

Chart-wise, &quot;Soup&quot; fared best in Canada, where it held the #14 spot on the RPM Weekly chart for the weeks of September 18 &amp; 25, 1995.

&quot;Soup&quot; was nominated for Best Recording Package - Boxed at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Legacy==
In 2005, &quot;Soup&quot; was ranked number 357 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In the book, Andreas Himmelstein called &quot;Soup&quot; &quot;a beautiful album filled with magical melodies that has completely undeservedly disappeared from the focus of the rock world.&quot;

In the 2009 book, &quot;A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon&quot;, drummer Glen Graham is quoted as saying, &quot;I talked to a guy from Spain yesterday [from &quot;Popular 1 Magazine&quot;], and he was saying, &quot;&quot;Soup&quot; is the top album of the &#x27;90s according to our readers.&#x27; It was like, &#x27;What?&#x27;&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Soup&quot; came in at the #1 on the &quot;Top 10 Underrated 90’s Alternative Rock Albums&quot; list for the Alternative Nation site.

The album took the number five spot on a &quot;Top 10 Most Overlooked and Underrated Albums of the 90s&quot; on the V+C website and was placed number 43 on the &quot;50 Best Alternative Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; list on the &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; site.

On January 17, 2017, &quot;Soup&quot; was reissued on limited edition vinyl via Analog Sparks (cut from the original stereo tapes and pressed on 180-gram vinyl).

In an interview with the &quot;Long Island Pulse&quot; website in 2018, Thorn discussed why he feels the album has developed a cult following over the years. &quot;It&#x27;s crazy. Twenty years later, I feel finally validated. We felt like it was such a great record when it originally came out. For it to be slammed so hard, a record we were so proud of, was confusing to us. It was like, &#x27;What? I thought we did a good job.&#x27; I get that it was dark and it was different than the first record, but in the end, it really grew on people. And more importantly, it has a great shelf life because people are not over it. I’m really flattered that people still care about that record.&quot;

In 2020, the &quot;Grammy&quot; site posted an article entitled &quot;How Blind Melon Lost Their Minds &amp; Made A Masterpiece: &#x27;Soup&#x27; Turns 25,&quot; that stated &quot;Soup has quietly become a dark-horse favorite of the alt-rock era among fans and critics.&quot;

==Planned live performance==
In the aforementioned interview with Songfacts in 2015, Thorn spoke about plans for the band to perform the &quot;Soup&quot; album in its entirety, for the first time ever. &quot;To celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the &quot;Soup&quot; record, Blind Melon is making plans to go play shows and perform the &quot;Soup&quot; record from top to bottom. We have never done that before, but we are excited to challenge ourselves. Some of the songs from the &quot;Soup&quot; record have never been performed live before.&quot; These performances of the entire album have never taken place.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Blind Melon.
* In addition to containing the hidden track &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, there is an additional hidden track in the pregap of the CD. To hear this track, listeners must stick the CD in their player, and as soon as track one begins, rewind the track to go into the negative pregap of a CD contained before index 01 in the CD&#x27;s table of contents. In addition to being in the pregap, the vocals are also backmasked, while the instruments are normal. This track acts as an overture, containing elements of the song &quot;New Life&quot;.

<text>Baby V.O.X () is a South Korean girl group formed in 1997, whose final and best-known line-up consisted of Kim E-Z, Lee Hee-jin, Shim Eun-jin, Kan Mi-youn, and Yoon Eun-hye. It is considered one of the most prominent &quot;first generation&quot; K-pop girl groups of the late 1990s and early 2000s, along with S.E.S. and Fin.K.L, and is recognized as one of the groups at the forefront of the Korean Wave, having broken into the Chinese market. The group released seven studio albums and disbanded in 2006.

On December 20, 2024, Baby V.O.X reunited for the first time in 14 years with a performance at the 2024 KBS Song Festival.

==History==
===1997–1999: Debut and early years===
Baby V.O.X began in 1997 as a five-member group consisting of Kim E-Z, Lee Hee-jin, Jung Hyun-jeon, Cha Yu-mi and Jung Shi-woon. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hair Cut&quot;, was taken from the album &quot;Equalizeher&quot;, released on July 10, 1997. The group displayed a style inspired by Spice Girls, but the first album was not successful because of the edgy concept. Cha Yumi was injured during the performance, so she was then replaced by Kan Miyoun. Hyun-jeon and Shi-woon left the group because of an internal conflict and they were replaced by Shim Eun Jin and Lee Gai. The group adopted a more modest and &quot;cutesy&quot; style, used by popular groups such as S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. From the album &quot;Baby V.O.X II&quot;, the single &quot;Ya Ya Ya&quot; became a success, reaching number seven on the Korean pop charts. It was followed by a second single, &quot;Change&quot;. Following the release, Lee Gai was forced out by DR Music, as the agency had falsified her age by nearly 10 years, leading to controversy when her true birth year was disclosed. She had first appeared with the trio Setorae over ten years before under her birth name of Lee Hee-jung.

===1999–2003: Breakthrough years and mainstream success===
In June 1999, Yoon Eun Hye replaced Lee Gai and this line-up became permanent. The single &quot;Get Up&quot; was released. For the first time, the group reached number one on the South Korean music pop charts. Another single, &quot;Killer&quot;, was also number one and received the Top Excellency Award in the Seoul Music Awards in 1999. The third single, &quot;Missing You&quot;, was also included on the album &quot;Come Come Come Baby&quot; (1999).

In the years that followed, Baby VOX made a number of appearances in variety shows. After the success of the third album, the group promoted itslf internationally, including in China, Japan and other Southeast Asian countries. The fourth album, &quot;Why&quot;, included the singles &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;배신 (Betrayal)&quot;, and the group hosted the television program &quot;Beautiful Sunday-Cruise to the Korea Strait&quot;. The group&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Boyish Story&quot;, was released in 2001 and included the singles &quot;Game Over&quot;, &quot;인형 (Doll)&quot; and &quot;I Wish You are My Love&quot;.

The group released a compilation album with singles 우연 (&quot;Coincidence&quot;) and &quot;Go&quot;; Coincidence was the group&#x27;s first number one single in three years. &quot;Coincidence&quot; was re-released for the 2002 World Cup and gained additional popularity. The group held a concert in Mongolia in 2004, the first South Korean idol band to do so. The group also performed in Pyongyang, North Korea in 2003, and was the second girl group to perform in North Korea.

===2003–2006: Final albums and separation===
In spring 2003, Baby VOX released a sixth album, &quot;Devotion&quot;. Baby VOX topped the Chinese music chart with the Chinese single &quot;I&#x27;m Still Loving You&quot; and the South Korean charts with &quot;What Should I Do&quot;.

The group&#x27;s seventh and final album, &quot;Ride West&quot;, released in April 2004, had songs in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean, as well as appearances by well-known American hip hop artists such as Tupac Shakur and Jennifer Lopez and the independent rapper Floss P, although Tupac&#x27;s &quot;appearance&quot; was a freestyle rap that he recorded while in prison. The rights for the sample of Tupac&#x27;s verse were not cleared, and this resulted in a court case pursued by the rapper&#x27;s mother, Afeni Shakur. A music video for the album&#x27;s feature song, &quot;Xcstasy&quot;, was made in English and emulated the hip-hop videos popular in the United States at the time. A member of the South Korean hip-hop group DJ DOC, offended by the alleged misuse of Tupac Shakur&#x27;s lyrics, denounced them in the media but later apologized. The group was forced to abandon the release of the single. A second single, &quot;Play Remix&quot; featuring Jennifer Lopez, was promoted for a short while, but sales were lower than from its previous albums.

Shim Eun-jin officially left the group in October 2004 and Yoon Eun-hye in April 2005. By May 2005 the group was no longer promoting, and it officially disbanded in February 2006.

===2010 : Reunion===
In August 2010, Baby V.O.X reunited for an appearance on the music talk show &quot;Kim Jung-eun&#x27;s Chocolate&quot;, marking their first group activity in six years after effectively disbanding in 2004.

===2024–present : Reunion stage and New Baby V.O.X 2025===
Baby V.O.X reunited again after 14 years in December 2024 with performance on KBS annual music show &quot;KBS Song Festival&quot;.

On January 17, 2025, according to Osen&#x27;s reporting, Baby V.O.X to appears on variety show for the first time in 14 years. On January 23, Baby V.O.X will participate in the MBC entertainment program &quot;Omniscient Interfere&quot;. On February 1, during an episode of Mr. House Husband 2, member Yoon Eun-hye revealed that the group would soon release re-recorded versions of some of their past songs. On February 13, the group released the single album &quot;New Baby V.O.X 2025&quot;, featuring re-recorded versions of Killer and Coincidence.

==Style and influence==
Baby VOX has consistently stated that they were inspired by the Spice Girls, who led the girl power movement in the UK during their early days, and since the late 1990s, they have been the first South Korean girl group to attempt sex appeal by adopting the R&amp;B and pop styles popularized by groups like TLC. The Wall Street Journal described them as &quot;the Asian version of the Spice Girls&quot;, and Japan&#x27;s Mainichi Shimbun introduced them as &quot;expected to cause a tectonic shift in the Japanese music industry&quot;. Domestic music industry insiders have stated that &quot;Baby Vox is considered to have laid the groundwork for today&#x27;s girl groups. They were a girl group ahead of their time, such as the first foreign singer to hold a solo concert in China&quot;, solidifying their influence. In 2014, Billboard selected Baby VOX as a K-pop girl group you should know.

===Significance and impact towards K-pop===
Their first album, which made its major debut on July 3, 1997, contained a feminist message. This was a topic that was unimaginable at the time, and unlike other girl groups that imitated Japanese girl groups such as Speed, they took advantage of POP and promoted themselves as the &quot;Spice Girls of Asia&quot;.

==Endorsements==
As one of the most popular groups of their time, Baby VOX endorsed many brands. Around September 1999, the group participated in a commercial for Hardee&#x27;s. The next following year of 2000, the group also were featured in the Lotte Ice Cream commercial. In 2004, the group were promotional ambassadors Korean Air.

It was initially defined to consist of:
* the Cities of Noranda and Rouyn;
* the Towns of Belleterre, Temiscaming and Ville-Marie;
* the County of Témiscamingue (except the Townships of Béraud, Chabert, Darlens, Desroberts, Granet, Jourdan, Landanet, Laubanie, Marrias, Mazérac, Pélissier and Sabourin without local municipal organization).

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of:
* the Cities of Noranda and Rouyn;
* the Towns of Belleterre, Duparquet, La Sarre, Macamic, Temiscaming and Ville-Marie;
* the County of Témiscamingue; and
* parts of the County of Abitibi.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of:
*the towns of Belleterre, Duparquet, La Sarre, Macamic, Noranda, Rouyn, Témiscaming and Ville-Marie;
*the County of Témiscamingue excluding the Territory of Témiscamingue-Lac-Granet portion;

<text>Babaalawo or babaláwo in West Africa (babalao in Caribbean and South American Spanish and babalaô in Brazilian Portuguese), literally means &quot;father of secrets&quot; (or “father of mysteries”) in the Yoruba language. It is a spiritual title that denotes a high priest of the Ifá oracle. Ifá is a divination system that represents the teachings of the òrìṣà Ọrunmila, the òrìṣà of wisdom, who in turn serves as the oracular representative of Olodumare.

== History of babalawo ==
The term &quot;babalawo&quot; typically refers to a Yoruba religious figure, often considered a priest or diviner, within the Ifá system of the Yoruba people in West Africa. The Ifá system is a complex and ancient divination and religious practice that has its roots in Yoruba mythology and culture and is deeply rooted in Yoruba history and mythology, making it challenging to pinpoint a specific beginning. However, it is generally believed that the Ifá system has ancient origins, dating back centuries within the Yoruba civilization.

The Ifá system revolves around the worship of Ọrunmila, who is considered the orisha (deity) of wisdom and divination. Ọrunmila is believed to have received the knowledge of Ifá from Olodumare, the supreme deity in the Yoruba pantheon. According to Yoruba mythology, Ọrunmila then shared this knowledge with human beings, and the practice of Ifá divination was established to guide individuals in making decisions, understanding their destiny, and seeking spiritual guidance.

Babalawos are the custodians of the Ifá knowledge and play a crucial role in performing Ifá divination ceremonies, interpreting the messages of Ọrunmila, and providing guidance to individuals and communities. They undergo extensive training and are initiated into the priesthood, often passing down their knowledge through apprenticeship and oral tradition.

While the specific historical details may be challenging to ascertain due to the ancient nature of the Ifá system, it is clear that the babalawo and Ifá practice have deep cultural and religious significance within the Yoruba community. Today, Ifá continues to be practiced not only in Nigeria, where the Yoruba people are predominant but also among Yoruba diaspora communities around the world.

==Functions in society==
The babalawos are believed to ascertain the future of their clients through communication with Ifá. This is done through the interpretation of either the patterns of the divining chain known as &quot;opele&quot;, or the sacred palm nuts called &quot;ikin&quot;, on the traditionally wooden divination tray called &quot;opon Ifá&quot;.

In addition to this, some of them also perform divination services on behalf of the kings and paramount chiefs of the Yoruba people. These figures, holders of chieftaincy titles like Araba and Oluwo Ifa in their own right, are members of the recognised aristocracies of the various Yoruba traditional states.

People can visit babalawos for spiritual consultations, which is known as &quot;Dafa&quot;. The religious system as a whole has been recognized by UNESCO as a “Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&quot;

== Impacts of babalawo ==
Babalawos are key custodians of the Ifá system, preserving and transmitting Yoruba cultural heritage through oral tradition, rituals, and ceremonies. This system provides a framework for understanding morality, human relationships, and the world at large. As spiritual leaders and diviners, babalawos offer guidance to individuals and communities by employing the Ifá divination process, addressing various aspects of life such as health, relationships, and career choices.

Furthermore, the Ifá system fosters community cohesion through participatory ceremonies, contributing to a shared cultural and religious framework. Some babalawos are also known for their knowledge of traditional healing practices, incorporating herbs, incantations, and spiritual interventions to address both physical and spiritual ailments within the community. Babalawos often play a role in conflict resolution within families or communities, drawing on the wisdom and ethical principles emphasized by the Ifá system. The impact extends to regions where the Yoruba diaspora has spread, resulting in cultural syncretism with other religious traditions, as seen in practices like Santería, Candomblé, and Vodou.

However, challenges and controversies exist. Critics may view certain practices as superstitious or express concerns about potential financial exploitation. Additionally, clashes may arise between traditional practices and modern views, particularly in societies undergoing rapid social changes.

Despite challenges, the Ifá system contributes significantly to the cultural identity of the Yoruba people, distinguishing them from other ethnic and religious groups and fostering pride in their cultural heritage. Moreover, global interest in the Ifa system from scholars, tourists, and spiritual seekers reflects its impact on a broader scale, with both positive appreciation for cultural richness and potential negative aspects related to commodification or misrepresentation of practices. The impacts of babalawo and the Ifá system are dynamic, evolving over time within the broader dynamics of cultural and religious practices in a changing world.

== In popular culture==
* &quot;Calle Luna, Calle Sol&quot;, a salsa song by Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe about Crime in Puerto Rico, mentions babalawo saying &quot;you may have a saint watching over you but you&#x27;re not a babalawo&quot; ().

<doc id="629901" wikidata="Q13359" url="?curid=629901" title="Mingrelian language">
<text>Mingrelian language, or Megrelian language (, ) is a Kartvelian language spoken in Western Georgia (regions of Mingrelia and Abkhazia), primarily by the Mingrelians. Mingrelian has historically been only a regional language within the boundaries of historical Georgian states and then modern Georgia, and the number of younger people speaking it has decreased substantially, with UNESCO designating it as a &quot;definitely endangered language&quot;.

==Distribution and status==

No reliable figure exists for the number of native speakers of Mingrelian, but it is estimated to be between 300,000 and 500,000. Most speakers live in the Mingrelia (or Samegrelo and formerly Odishi) region of Georgia, which comprises the Odishi Hills and the Colchis Lowlands, from the Black Sea coast to the Svan Mountains and the Tskhenistskali River. Smaller enclaves existed in Abkhazia, but the ongoing civil unrest there has displaced many Mingrelian speakers to other regions of Georgia. Their geographical distribution is relatively compact, which has helped to promote the transmission of the language between generations.

Mingrelian is generally written in the Georgian alphabet, but it has no written standard or official status. Almost all speakers are bilingual; they use Mingrelian mainly for familiar and informal conversation, and Georgian (or, for expatriate speakers, the local official language) for other purposes.

==History==
Mingrelian is one of the Kartvelian languages. It is closely related to Laz, from which it has become differentiated mostly in the past 500 years, after the northern (Mingrelian) and southern (Laz) communities were separated by Turkic invasions. It is less closely related to Georgian, the two branches having separated in the first millennium BC or earlier, and even more distantly related to Svan, which is believed to have branched off in the 2nd millennium BC or earlier. Mingrelian is mutually intelligible only with Laz.

Some linguists refer to Mingrelian and Laz as Zan languages. Zan had already split into Mingrelian and Laz variants by early modern times, however, and it is not customary to speak of a unified Zan language today.

The oldest surviving texts in Mingrelian date from the 19th century, and are mainly items of ethnographical literature. The earliest linguistic studies of Mingrelian include a phonetic analysis by Aleksandre Tsagareli (1880), and grammars by Ioseb Kipshidze (1914) and Shalva Beridze (1920). From 1930 to 1938 several newspapers were published in Mingrelian, such as &quot;Kazakhishi Gazeti&quot;, &quot;Komuna&quot;, &quot;Samargalosh Chai&quot;, &quot;Narazenish Chai&quot;, and &quot;Samargalosh Tutumi&quot;. More recently, there has been some revival of the language, with the publication of a Mingrelian–Georgian dictionary by Otar Kajaia, a Mingrelian-German dictionary by Otar Kajaia and Heinz Fähnrich, and books of poems by Lasha Gakharia, Edem Izoria, Lasha Gvasalia, Guri Otobaia, Giorgi Sichinava, Jumber Kukava, and Vakhtang Kharchilava, journal Skani, Mingrelian Wikipedia, as well as books and magazines published by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Mingrelian has five vowel phonemes /i ɛ a ɔ u/. The Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect has a sixth /ə/ which is the result of assimilation of /i/ and /u/.

===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of Mingrelian contains series of aspirated and ejective consonants that contrast with voiced consonants. The inventory and is almost identical to that of Laz, Georgian, and Svan. The table below shows the consonants of Mingrelian in romanized script, phonetic symbols from the IPA, and in Mkhedruli script.

===Phonetic processes===

====Vowel reduction====
Certain pairs of vowels reduce to single vowels:
*&quot;ae&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; → &quot;ee&quot; → &quot;e&quot;
*&quot;ao&quot;, &quot;oa&quot; and &quot;oo&quot; → &quot;aa&quot; → &quot;a&quot;
*&quot;ou → uu → u&quot;

In Zugdidi-Samurzaqano dialect the vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; also often reduce to &quot;ə&quot;.

====Pre-consonant change of velar &quot;g&quot;====
Before consonants, &quot;g&quot; → &quot;r&quot;.

====Positional change of uvular &quot;q&quot;&#x27; sound====
In word-initial prevocalic and intervocalic positions, &quot;q&#x27; → ʔ&quot;. Before the consonant &quot;v&quot;, &quot;q&#x27; → ɣ/ǩ&quot;.

====Regressive assimilation of consonants====
The common types are:
*voicing/devoicing of voiceless/voiced consonants before voiced/voiceless ones (respectively).
*glottalization of consonants before the glottalized ones and the glottal stop.

====Progressive dissimilation====
If the stem contains &quot;r&quot; then the suffixes &quot;-ar&quot; and &quot;-ur&quot; transform to &quot;-al&quot; and &quot;-ul&quot;, e.g. &quot;(, the village)→&quot; (&quot;Khorgan&quot;).
The rule is not valid if in the stem with &quot;r&quot; an &quot;l&quot; appears later, e.g. &quot;(&quot;Martvili&quot;, the town) dj&quot; &quot;(adj. &quot;Martvilian&quot;)&quot;

In a stem with voiceless affricates or voiceless sibilants, a later &quot;ǯ&quot; is deaffricated to &quot;d&quot;, e.g. &quot;dj&quot; &quot;comb&quot;, &quot;dj&quot; &quot;fly (insect)&quot;, &quot;dj&quot; &quot;arrow&quot;, etc.

====The transformation of &quot;l&quot;====
*in all dialects of Mingrelian, before consonants &quot;l&quot; → &quot;r&quot;.
*in the Martvili subdialect in word-initial prevocalic position, &quot;l → y → ∅&quot; and in intervocalic position &quot;l → ∅&quot; 

====Intervocalic deletion of &quot;v&quot;====
Between the vowels the organic &quot;v&quot; disappears, e.g. &quot;(Geo. &quot;abundance, plenty&quot;) →&quot; &quot;→&quot; (id.), &quot;(Geo. &quot;raceme&quot;) →&quot; (id.), etc.

====Phonetic augmentation &quot;n&quot;====
Before the stops and affricates, an inorganic augmentation &quot;n&quot; may appear (before labials &quot;n → m&quot;).

==Mingrelian orthography==
Mingrelian is written in Mkhedruli, Latin and Cyrillic scripts. The spelling using the Mkhedruli script uses symbols not used in Georgian : ⟨ჲ ჷ ჸ⟩ to represent /j ə ʔ/, respectively. 

==Grammar==
==Dialects==
The main dialects and subdialects of Mingrelian are:

* Zugdidi-Samurzakano or Northwest dialect
** Jvari
* Senaki-poti or Southeast dialect
** Martvili-Bandza
** Abasha
==Famous speakers==
*Lavrenti Beria, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s chief of secret police
*Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, one of the most influential Georgian writers of the 20th century
*Zviad Gamsakhurdia, first president of post-Soviet Georgia
*Antisa Khvichava, claimed world&#x27;s oldest person (purportedly 132 years old at the time of her death in 2012).
*Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Georgian footballer
*Ilia Topuria, Spanish and Georgian mixed martial artist

<doc id="629920" wikidata="Q840444" url="?curid=629920" title="Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi">
<text>was a village located in Nishiyatsushiro District, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2006, the village had an estimated population of 1,501 and a density of 17 persons per km2. The total area was 86.59 km2.

Kamikuishiki achieved nationwide fame in Japan as a major center of the notorious cult religion Aum Shinrikyo which built its religious center and several facilities there. This included a production center named Satyan 7, located in the Fujigamine district for nerve gases which were used in attacks on the Tokyo subway and in Matsumoto. It was in one of these buildings that the leader of the cult Shoko Asahara was arrested on May 16, 1995.

On March 1, 2006:
* The northern part of Kamikuishiki (the localities of &quot;Furuseki&quot; and &quot;Kakehashi&quot;), along with the town of Nakamichi (from Higashiyatsushiro District), was merged into the expanded city of Kōfu. 
* The southern part of Kamikuishiki (the localities of &quot;Fujigane&quot;, &quot;Motosu&quot; and &quot;Shoji&quot;) was merged into the expanded town of Fujikawaguchiko (of Minamitsuru District). Kamikuishiki was officially dissolved as an independent municipality. According to the last mayor Makoto Kobayashi, &quot;financial reasons&quot; made the decision inevitable. Economic decline made the villagers leave for larger areas where jobs are more readily available. Reduced tax collections and aging population also played their role.
Lake Shōji and Lake Motosu, two of the famous Fuji Five Lakes, are in Kamikuishiki.

<text>The 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election took place on November 3, 1998. Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura, the former mayor of Brooklyn Park and a former professional wrestler, won office, defeating Republican St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman and DFL state attorney general Skip Humphrey. He succeeded Republican incumbent Arne Carlson. Ventura&#x27;s victory as a third-party candidate was considered a historic major upset.

To date, the election marks the only time a Reform Party candidate won a major government office. It also remains the last time a third-party candidate won any statewide election in Minnesota.

==DFL primary==
===Candidates===
*Skip Humphrey, Attorney General of Minnesota and son of former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey and former U.S. Senator Muriel Humphrey 
**Running mate: Roger Moe, Minnesota Senate Majority Leader (SD2)

**Running mate: Deanna Winter, political reporter
*Mike Freeman, Hennepin County Attorney and son of former Governor Orville Freeman
**Running mate: Ruth Johnson, State Representative (HD24B) 
*Doug Johnson, State Senator (SD6) from the Iron Range and Chair of the Senate Committee on Taxation

===Polling===
===Results===




==Republican primary==
===Candidates===
*Norm Coleman, mayor of St. Paul
**Running mate: Gen Olson, State Senator (Rep-SD34)
*Bill Dahn, retired auto mechanic

Norm Coleman was elected mayor of St. Paul in 1993 as a Democrat with almost 55% of the vote. In 1996, he switched parties to become a Republican after years of heat from his party. He won re-election as mayor in the heavily Democratic city with almost 59% of the vote in 1997.

===Polling===
===Results===
Coleman won the Republican nomination by winning the primary with token opposition.



==General election==
===Candidates===
*Norm Coleman, mayor of St. Paul (Republican)
**Running mate: Gen Olson, State Senator (Rep-SD34)
* Thomas Fiske (Socialist Workers)
* Frank Germann (Libertarian)
*Skip Humphrey, Attorney General of Minnesota and son of former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey and former U.S. Senator Muriel Humphrey (DFL)
**Running mate: Roger Moe, Minnesota Senate Majority Leader (SD2)
* &quot;Fancy&quot; Ray McCloney (&quot;People&#x27;s Champion&quot;)
* Ken Pentel (Green)
* Jesse Ventura, former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler (Reform)
** Running mate: Mae Schunk, Inver Grove Heights teacher
* Chris Wright (Grassroots)

Ventura ran unopposed in his party&#x27;s primary.

===Campaign===
Humphrey was seen as the initial favorite, having scored a $6 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in May of that year. The DFL primary saw candidates mostly focusing on issues, rather than attacking Humphrey. Humphrey had lost the party&#x27;s endorsement to Mike Freeman. The primary was nicknamed the &quot;My Three Sons&quot; campaign, owing to the political pedigree of three of the candidates, and Mark Dayton, heir to the Dayton fortune. Humphrey was endorsed by the Star Tribune in the run up to November.

Coleman started as a strong challenger to Humphrey. Coleman received the Republican endorsement over more conservative candidates Allen Quist and Joanne Benson. Coleman ran as a social conservative, opposing abortion and gay marriage. He also campaigned on using the state&#x27;s budget surplus to cut taxes, as well as expanding the state&#x27;s school choice program to include school vouchers.

Ventura spent around $300,000 and combined it with an aggressive grassroots campaign that featured a statewide bus tour, pioneered use of the Internet for political purposes, and aired quirky TV ads designed by Bill Hillsman, who forged the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t vote for politics as usual.&quot; Unable to afford many television ads, Ventura mainly focused on televised debates and public appearances, preaching his brand of libertarian politics. His speech at a parade in rural Minnesota during the summer attracted what organizers of the annual event described as one of its largest audiences. He ran on cutting taxes, reducing state government, and reducing public school classroom sizes to a 17 to 1 ratio. He also supported a public debate on the viability of legalized prostitution.

===Polling===
A poll taken in June showed that Coleman would defeat any other Democratic candidate than Humphrey; Humphrey would defeat Coleman 44% to 34%. However, Ventura polled in the double digits. No other candidate in the Reform Party&#x27;s brief history in Minnesota has received more than 5 percent of the votes in a statewide election. Following the primary election in September, a poll on October 20 showed Humphrey leading 35% to Coleman (34%) and Ventura (21%). But the Star Tribune poll suggested that Ventura&#x27;s surge with the voters had come mostly at Humphrey&#x27;s expense. Since the primary, Humphrey&#x27;s support among likely voters had dropped by 14 percentage points, while Coleman&#x27;s had increased by 5 percentage points.

It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&amp;B, rock, jazz, gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. The term &quot;K-pop&quot; became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. The Korean term for domestic pop music is gayo (), which is still widely used within South Korea. While &quot;K-pop&quot; can refer to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, the term is often used when referring to artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless of the genre of music output.

Modern K-pop &quot;idol&quot; culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music grew into a subculture of South Korean culture and amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults. The more modern form of the genre, originally termed &quot;rap dance&quot;, emerged with the formation of the hip hop boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea&#x27;s contemporary music scene. After a slump in early idol music, TVXQ and BoA from 2003 marked a new generation of K-pop idols that helped the music genre gain traction in the neighboring Japanese market and continues to popularize K-pop internationally today. With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia, but also throughout the world, gaining an international audience.

In 2018, K-pop became a &quot;power player&quot; with a 17.9% increase in revenue growth. As of 2019, Korean popular music is ranked sixth among the top ten music markets worldwide according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#x27;s &quot;Global Music Report 2019&quot;, with artists BTS and Blackpink leading the growth. 2020 was a record-breaking year for K-pop when it experienced a 44.8% growth and became the fastest-growing major market of the year.

The K-pop industry has found itself at the center of multiple controversies that reflect the different social expectations in modern Korea. Idols are often subject to very restrictive contracts, sometimes called &quot;slave contracts&quot;. Their statements must not be controversial or cause any scandal. Their diets, behavior, and love lives are tightly controlled, yet their performances are often sexualized. Undergoing cosmetic surgery is common, adding to the pressure to appear perfect and flawless. The suicides of multiple idols have shaken the industry over the years, most notably those of Kim Jong-hyun, Sulli and Goo Hara.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;K-pop&quot; is the Korean equivalent of the Japanese &quot;J-pop,&quot; The first known use of the term occurred in &quot;Billboard&quot; in the October 9, 1999 edition at the end of an article titled &quot;S. Korea To Allow Some Japanese Live Acts&quot; by Cho Hyun-jin, then a Korea correspondent for the magazine, which used it as a broad term for South Korean pop music. Cho himself, however, is not sure if he coined the term, since some articles stated that the word &#x27;K-pop&#x27; was already being used by music industry insiders, even though he had never heard it personally.

== Characteristics ==

=== Audiovisual content ===
Although K-pop generally refers to South Korean popular music and the associated industry, some consider it to be an all-encompassing genre exhibiting a wide spectrum of musical and visual elements. The French Institut national de l&#x27;audiovisuel defines K-pop as a &quot;fusion of synthesized music, sharp dance routines and fashionable, colorful outfits.&quot; Songs typically consist of one or a mixture of pop, rock, hip hop, R&amp;B, and electronic music genres.

=== Idol trainee ===

The mainstream method is to become an idol trainee through agency auditions, online auditions, or street casting.

South Korean management agencies offer binding contracts to potential artists, sometimes at a young age. Trainees live together in a regulated environment and spend many hours a day learning how to sing, dance, speak foreign languages, and gain other skills in preparation for their debut. This &quot;robotic&quot; system of training is often criticized by Western media outlets. In 2012, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the cost of training one Korean idol under SM Entertainment averaged US$3 million.

=== Hybrid genre and transnational values ===

K-pop is a cultural product that features &quot;values, identity and meanings that go beyond their strictly commercial value.&quot; It is characterized by a mixture of modern Western sounds and African-American influences (including sounds from Hip-hop, R&amp;B, Jazz, black pop, soul, funk, techno, disco, house, and Afrobeats) with a Korean aspect of performance (including synchronized dance moves, formation changes and the so-called &quot;point choreography&quot; consisting of hooking and repetitive key movements). It has been remarked that there is a &quot;vision of modernization&quot; inherent in Korean pop culture. For some, the transnational values of K-pop are responsible for its success. A commentator at the University of California, San Diego has said that &quot;contemporary Korean pop culture is built on ... transnational flows ... taking place across, beyond, and outside national and institutional boundaries.&quot; Some examples of the transnational values inherent in K-pop that may appeal to those from different ethnic, national, and religious backgrounds include a dedication to high-quality output and presentation of idols, as well as their work ethic and polite social demeanor, made possible by the training period.

==== Use of English phrases ====
Modern K-pop is marked by its use of English phrases. Jin Dal Yong of &quot;Popular Music and Society&quot; wrote that the usage may be influenced by &quot;Korean-Americans and/or Koreans who studied in the U.S. [who] take full advantage of their English fluency and cultural resources that are not found commonly among those who were raised and educated in Korea.&quot; Korean pop music from singers or groups who are Korean-American such as Fly to the Sky, g.o.d, Rich, Yoo Seung-jun, and Drunken Tiger has both American style and English lyrics. These Korean-American singers&#x27; music has a different style from common Korean music, which attracts the interest of young people. Increasingly, foreign songwriters and producers are employed to work on songs for K-pop idols, such as will.i.am and Sean Garrett. Foreign musicians, including rappers such as Akon, Kanye West, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg, have also featured on K-pop songs.

Entertainment companies help to expand K-pop to other parts of the world through a number of different methods. Singers need to use English since the companies want to occupy markets in the other parts of Asia, which enables them to open the Western market in the end. Most K-pop singers learn English because it is a common language in the world of music, but some singers also learn other foreign languages such as Japanese to approach the Japanese market. Similarly, increasing numbers of K-pop bands use English names rather than Korean ones. This allows songs and artists to be marketed to a wider audience around the world.
However, the use of English has not guaranteed the popularity of K-pop in the North American market. For some commentators, the reason for this is because the genre can be seen as a distilled version of Western music, making it difficult for K-pop to find acceptance in these markets. Furthermore, Western audiences tend to place emphasis on authenticity and individual expression in music, which the idol system can be seen as suppressing. 
According to Elaine W. Chun&#x27;s research, even though hybridity appears more and more often in K-pop, and sometimes may even make fans admire K-pop stars more because it is fresh, new and interesting, it is hard to change those who believe in a perfect ideal for pure linguistic. This means that the original form of language is still difficult to alter.
Artist names, song titles, and lyrics have exhibited significant growth in the usage of English words. No singers in the top fifty charts in 1990 had English in their names: people who worked in the Korean music industry viewed using Korean names as standard. In 1995, most popular singers such as Kim Gun-mo, Park Mi-kyung, Park Jin-young, Lee Seung-chul, and Byun Jin-sub still used Korean names, but fourteen of the singers and groups in the top fifty used English names, including DJ DOC, 015B, Piano, and Solid. After the 1997 financial crisis, the government stopped censoring English lyrics and Korea started to have a boom in English. Since the late 1990s, English usage in singers&#x27; names, song titles, and lyrics has grown quickly. Seventeen singers in the top fifty charts used English names in 2000, and thirty-one did so in 2005. In 2010, forty-one singers used English names among the top fifty songs, but usually, three or four singers and groups had more than one or two songs on the chart simultaneously. Korean names (e.g. Baek Ji-young, Seo In-young, and Huh Gak) are seen less frequently, and many K-pop singers have English names (e.g. IU, Sistar, T-ara, GD &amp; TOP, Beast, and After School). Notably, until the early 1990s, musicians with English names would transliterate them into hangul, but now singers would use English names written with the Roman alphabet. In 1995, the percentage of song titles using English in the top 50 charts was 8%. This fluctuated between 30% in 2000, 18% in 2005, and 44% in 2010. An example of a Korean song with a large proportion of English lyrics is Kara&#x27;s &quot;Jumping,&quot; which was released at the same time in both Korea and Japan to much success.

=== Marketing ===

Many agencies have presented new idol groups to an audience through a &quot;debut showcase&quot; which consists of online marketing and television broadcast promotions as opposed to radio. Groups are given a name and a &quot;concept&quot; along with a marketing hook. These concepts are the type of visual and musical theme that idol groups utilize during their debut or comeback. Concepts can change between debuts and fans often distinguish between boy group concepts and girl group concepts. Concepts can also be divided between general concepts and theme concepts, such as cute or fantasy. New idol groups will often debut with a concept well known to the market to secure a successful debut. Sometimes sub-units or sub-groups are formed among existing members. Two example subgroups are Super Junior-K.R.Y., which consists of Super Junior members Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung, and Super Junior-M, which became one of the best-selling K-pop subgroups in China.

Online marketing includes music videos posted to YouTube in order to reach a worldwide audience. Prior to the actual video, the group releases teaser photos and trailers. Promotional cycles of subsequent singles are called comebacks even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.

=== Dance ===

Dance is an integral part of K-pop. When combining multiple singers, the singers often switch their positions while singing and dancing by making prompt movements in synchrony, a strategy called &quot;formation changing&quot; (). The K-pop choreography () often includes the so-called &quot;point dance&quot; (), referring to a dance made up of hooking and repetitive movements within the choreography that matches the characteristics of the lyrics of the song. Super Junior&#x27;s &quot;Sorry Sorry&quot; and Brown Eyed Girls&#x27; &quot;Abracadabra&quot; are examples of songs with notable &quot;point&quot; choreography. To choreograph a dance for a song requires the writers to take the tempo into account. According to Ellen Kim, a Los Angeles dancer and choreographer, a fan&#x27;s ability to do the same steps must also be considered. Consequently, K-pop choreographers have to simplify movements.
The training and preparation necessary for K-pop idols to succeed in the industry and dance successfully are intense. Training centers like Seoul&#x27;s Def Dance Skool develop the dance skills of youth in order to give them a shot at becoming an idol. Physical training is one of the largest focuses at the school, as much of a student&#x27;s schedule is based around dance and exercise. The entertainment labels are highly selective, so few make it to fame. Students at the school must dedicate their lives to the mastery of dance in order to prepare for the vigorous routines performed by K-pop groups. This, of course, means that the training must continue if they are signed. Companies house much larger training centers for those who are chosen.

An interview with K-pop choreographer Rino Nakasone lends insight into the process of creating routines. According to Nakasone, her focus is to make dance routines that are flattering for the dancers but also complementary to the music. Her ideas are submitted to the entertainment company as video recordings done by professional dancers. Nakasone mentions that the company and the K-pop artists themselves have input on a song&#x27;s choreography. Choreographer May J. Lee gives another perspective, telling that her choreography often starts out as expressing the feeling or the meaning of the lyrics. What starts out as small movements turns into a full dance that is better able to portray the message of the song.

=== Fashion ===

The emergence of Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 paved the way for the development of contemporary K-pop groups. The group revolutionized the Korean music scene by incorporating rap and American hip-hop conventions into their music. This adoption of Western style extended to the fashions worn by the boy band: the members adopted a hip-hop aesthetic. Seo and bandmates&#x27; outfits for the promotional cycle of &quot;I Know&quot; included vibrant streetwear such as oversized T-shirts and sweatshirts, windbreakers, overalls worn with one strap, overalls worn with one pant leg rolled up, and American sports team jerseys. Accessories included baseball caps worn backwards, bucket hats, and do-rags.

As K-pop &quot;was born of post-Seo trends,&quot; many acts that followed Seo Taiji and Boys adopted the same fashion style. Deux and DJ DOC can also be seen wearing on-trend hip-hop fashions such as sagging baggy pants, sportswear, and bandanas in their performances. With Korean popular music transforming into youth-dominated media, manufactured teenage idol groups began debuting in the mid and late 1990s, wearing coordinated costumes that reflected the popular fashion trends among youth at the time. Hip-hop fashion, considered the most popular style in the late &#x27;90s, remained, with idol groups H.O.T. and Sechs Kies wearing the style for their debut songs. The use of accessories elevated the idol&#x27;s style from everyday fashion to performance costume, like ski goggles (worn either around the head or neck), headphones worn around the neck, and oversized gloves worn to accentuate choreography moves were widely used. H.O.T.&#x27;s 1996 hit &quot;Candy&quot; exemplifies the level of coordination taken into account for idol&#x27;s costumes, as each member wore a designated color and accessorized with face paint, fuzzy oversized mittens, visors, bucket hats, and earmuffs, and used stuffed animals, backpacks, and messenger bags as props.
While male idol groups&#x27; costumes were constructed with similar color schemes, fabrics, and styles, the outfits worn by each member still maintained individuality. On the other hand, female idol groups of the &#x27;90s wore homogeneous costumes, often styled identically. The costumes for female idols during their early promotions often focused on portraying an innocent, youthful image. S.E.S.&#x27;s debut in 1997, &quot;(&#x27;Cause) I&#x27;m Your Girl&quot;, and Baby Vox&#x27;s second album 1998 hit, &quot;Ya Ya Ya,&quot; featured the girls dressed in white outfits, &quot;To My Boyfriend&quot; by Fin.K.L shows idols in pink schoolgirl costumes, and &quot;One&quot; and &quot;End&quot; of Chakra presented Hindu and African style costumes. To portray a natural and somewhat saccharine image, the accessories were limited to large bows, pompom hair ornaments and hair bands. With the maturation of female idol groups and the removal of bubblegum pop in the late 1990s, the sets of female idol groups focused on following the fashion trends of the time, many of which were revealing pieces. The latest promotions of the girl groups Baby Vox and Jewelry exemplify these trends of hot pants, micro-miniskirts, crop tops, peasant blouses, transparent garments and blouses on the upper part of the torso.

As K-pop became a modern hybrid of Western and Asian cultures starting from the late 2000s, fashion trends within K-pop reflected diversity and distinction as well. Fashion trends from the late 2000s to early 2010s can largely be categorized under the following:
*Street: focuses on individuality; features bright colors, mix-and-match styling, graphic prints, and sports brands such as Adidas and Reebok.
* Retro: aims to bring back &quot;nostalgia&quot; from the 1960s to 1980s; features dot prints and detailed patterns. Common clothing items include denim jackets, boot-cut pants, wide pants, hair bands, scarves, and sunglasses.
* Sexy: highlights femininity and masculinity; features revealing outfits made of satin, lace, fur, and leather. Common clothing items include mini skirts, corsets, net stockings, high heels, sleeveless vests, and see-through shirts.
*Black &amp; White: emphasizes modern and chic, symbolizes elegance and charisma, mostly applied to formal wear.
* Futurism: commonly worn with electronic and hip-hop genres; features popping color items, metallic details and prints; promotes a futuristic outlook.
K-pop has a significant influence on fashion in Asia, where trends started by idols are followed by young audiences. Some idols have established status as fashion icons, such as G-Dragon and CL, who has repeatedly worked with fashion designer Jeremy Scott, being labeled his &quot;muse.&quot;

According to professor Ingyu Oh, &quot;K-pop emphasizes thin, tall, and feminine looks with adolescent or sometimes very cute facial expressions, regardless of whether they&#x27;re male or female singers.&quot;

=== Government support ===

The South Korean government has acknowledged benefits to the country&#x27;s export sector as a result of the Korean Wave (it was estimated in 2011 that a US$100 increase in the export of cultural products resulted in a US$412 increase in exports of other consumer goods including food, clothes, cosmetics and IT products) and thus have subsidized certain endeavours. Government initiatives to expand the popularity of K-pop are mostly undertaken by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, which is responsible for the worldwide establishment of Korean Cultural Centers. South Korean embassies and consulates have also organized K-pop concerts outside the country, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly invites overseas K-pop fans to attend the annual K-Pop World Festival in South Korea.

In addition to reaping economic benefits from the popularity of K-pop, the South Korean government has been taking advantage of the influence of K-pop in diplomacy. In an age of mass communication, soft power (pursuing one&#x27;s goals by persuading stakeholders using cultural and ideological power) is regarded as a more effective and pragmatic diplomatic tactic than the traditional diplomatic strategy hard power (obtaining what one wants from stakeholders through direct intimidation such as military threat and economic sanctions). Cultural diplomacy through K-pop is a form of soft power.

An example of the South Korean government effort in diplomacy through K-pop is the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), a K-pop music award ceremony. Park Geun-hye (the Korean president at the time) delivered the opening statement at the 2014 MAMA, which was held in Hong Kong and sponsored by the Korean Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA). This event was considered a deliberate endeavor by the Korean government to support Korean cultural industries in order to strengthen the nation&#x27;s international reputation and political influence.

Another example of cultural diplomacy is K-pop performances in North Korea. Prior to 2005, South Korean pop singers occasionally gave performances in North Korea. After an interval of more than a decade, approximately 190 South Korean performers, including well-known musicians Red Velvet, Lee Sun-hee, Cho Yong-pil, and Yoon Do-hyun, performed in Pyongyang, North Korea, on March 31 and April 3, 2018. Kim Jong Un was present in the audience.

==History==

===Origins of Korean popular music===
The history of Korean popular music can be traced back to 1885 when an American missionary, Henry Appenzeller, began teaching American and British folk songs at a school. These songs were called &quot;changga&quot; (), and they were typically based on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics. For example, the song &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot; became known as &quot;Simcheongga&quot; (). During the Japanese colonial period (1910–1945), the popularity of &quot;changga&quot; songs rose as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music. One of the most popular songs was &quot;Huimangga&quot; (). The Japanese confiscated the existing &quot;changga&quot; collections and published lyrics books of their own.

K-pop was represented by H.O.T in the early days, and it was mostly fanatical, flashy, and showed the rebellious psychology of young people in the emotional aspects. Most of the songs are relatively fast-paced and have a strong sense of rhythm, which is suitable for dancing. They often sing and dance when they perform, and the choreography urbanance is a very important factor in popularity. The first known Korean pop album was &quot;I Pungjin Sewol&quot; (), by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs translated from Japanese. The first pop song written by a Korean composer is thought to be &quot;Nakhwayusu&quot; () sung by Lee Jeong-suk in 1929. In the mid-1920s, Japanese composer Masao Koga mixed traditional Korean music with Gospel music that American Evangelists introduced in the 1870s. This type of music became known as Enka in Japan, and later in Korea developed into Trot (). In the 1930s singers such as Wang Su-bok, Lee Eun-pa and the Jeogori Sisters popularised folk music further.

===1940s–1960s: Arrival of Western culture===

After the Korean Peninsula was partitioned into North and South following its liberation in 1945 from Japanese occupation, Western culture was introduced into South Korea on a small scale, with a few Western-styled bars and clubs playing Western music. After the Korean War (1950–1953) U.S. troops remained in South Korea, causing American and world culture to spread in South Korea and Western music to gradually become more accepted. Prominent figures of American entertainment like Nat King Cole, Marilyn Monroe and Louis Armstrong held USO shows in South Korea for the U.S. Army. These visits prompted attention from the Korean public. In 1957, the American Forces Korea Network radio started its broadcast, spreading the popularity of Western music. American music started influencing Korean music, as pentatony was gradually replaced by heptachords and popular songs started to be modeled after American ones.

In the 1960s, the development of LP records and improvements in recording technology led to the pursuit of diverse voice tones. Open auditions were also held to recruit musicians to perform at the U.S. army clubs. Since South Korea was impoverished after the Korean War, skilled Korean singers regarded performing for the U.S. troops as a good means to earn money. Many singers sang for the American troops, usually in dedicated clubs, the number of which rose to 264. They performed various genres like country music, blues, jazz and rock &amp; roll. The South Korean economy started blooming and popular music followed the trend, spread by the first commercial radio stations. Korean cinema also began to develop and Korean musicians began performing to wider audiences.

When Beatlemania reached the shores of Korea the first local rock bands appeared, the first of which is said to be Add4, a band founded in 1962. The first talent contest for rock bands in Seoul was organized in 1968.

Some Korean singers gained international popularity. In 1959, the Kim Sisters went to Las Vegas and became the first Korean artist to release an album in the U.S. pop market. Their cover of &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; reached No.7 on the Billboard Single Chart. The Kim Sisters also appeared on TV programs and radio programs and held tours in the U.S. and Europe. They made 25 appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show—more than American stars like Patti Page and Louis Armstrong (who appeared 18 times each). The Kim Sisters, Yoon Bok-hee and Patti Kim were the first singers to debut in such countries as Vietnam and the United States. The Kim Sisters became the first Korean group to release an album in the United States. They also performed in Las Vegas. &#x27;s 1961 song &quot;The Boy in The Yellow Shirt&quot; was covered by French singer Yvette Giraud and was also popular in Japan.

In the 1960s, the Korean artists such as Shin Joong-hyun, and Patti Kim who previously performed for the U.S. army clubs reached out to the Korean public. In the mid-1960s, due to the influence of the legendary British group The Beatles, there was a rise of &quot;group sound&quot; in South Korea, for example, Add4 and the .  Add4, Korea&#x27;s first rock group, was formed by Shin Joong-hyun in 1962 and produced Korea&#x27;s first rock song, &quot;The Woman in the Rain,&quot; which is a form of light rock reminiscent of the early Beatles. Shin Joong-hyun was so instrumental in the development of Korean rock music that he is regarded as the &quot;godfather of Korean rock&quot; in South Korea.

During this period, with the rise of Western pop music and Korean rock music, trot was no longer predominant in South Korea. However, trot singers like Lee Mi-ja still managed to attract a certain level of popularity, with famous songs like &quot;Camellia Lady&quot; ().

During the 1950s and 60s, Western pop music, Korean rock music, and trot co-existed in South Korea.

=== Late 1960s and 1970s: Hippie and folk influences ===
At the end of the 1960s Korean pop music underwent another transformation. More and more musicians were university students and graduates who were heavily influenced by American culture and lifestyle (including the hippie movement of the 1960s) and made lighthearted music unlike their predecessors, who were influenced by war and Japanese oppression. The younger generation opposed the Vietnam War as much as American hippies did, which resulted in the Korean government banning songs with more liberal lyrics. In spite of this, folk-influenced pop remained popular among the youth, and local television channel MBC organized a music contest for university students in 1977. This was the foundation of several modern music festivals. The younger generation born after the 1950s had grown up under the U.S. influence and preferred the U.S. lifestyle, giving rise to the &quot;youth culture&quot; which was expressed through long hair, jeans, acoustic guitars and folk music.  The folk music of that time is made up of melodies sung plainly, with the singing accompanied by a guitar or two. A majority of the folk music at that time was initiated by elite university students and those who graduated from prestigious schools. Like the activists of the U.S. student movement, they turned to folk music as the preferred music of politicized youth, who staged demonstrations against the authoritarian government.  In turn, the government banned folk music due to its association with the students&#x27; anti-government movements. In the 1970s, the Park Chung Hee government banned American pop music and Korean rock music for their association with sex and drugs. Shin Joong-hyun, the &quot;godfather of Korean rock music,&quot; was imprisoned in 1975 due to a marijuana scandal. In order to bolster its anti-Japanese credentials, the government also banned trot songs because of its &quot;Japanese style&quot; () given the influence of Japanese enka songs on trot. However, President Park actually embraced trot.

One of the leading figures of the era was Hahn Dae-soo, who was raised in the United States and influenced by Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and John Lennon. Han&#x27;s song &quot;Mul jom juso&quot; () became iconic among young people in Korea. His daring performances and unique singing style often shocked the public and later he was banned from performing in Korea. Han moved to New York City and pursued his musical career there, only returning to his home country in the 1990s. Other notable singers of the period include Song Chang-sik, Jo Young-nam, and Yang Hee-eun.

In the 1970s, DJs also started to become popular.

===1980s: The era of ballads===

The 1980s saw the rise of ballad singers after &#x27;s 1985 album &quot;You&#x27;re Too Far Away to Get Close to&quot; () sold more than 300,000 copies. Other popular ballad singers included Lee Moon-se () and Byun Jin-sub (), nicknamed the &quot;Prince of Ballads&quot;. One of the most sought-after ballad composers of the era was Lee Young-hoon (), whose songs were compiled into a modern musical in 2011 titled &quot;Gwanghwamun Yeonga&quot; ().

The Asia Music Forum was launched in 1980, with representatives from five different Asian countries competing in the event. Korean singer Cho Yong-pil won first place and went on to have a successful career, performing in Hong Kong and Japan. His first album &quot;Chang bakkui yeoja&quot; () was a hit and he became the first Korean singer to take to the stage at Carnegie Hall in New York. Cho&#x27;s musical repertoire included rock, dance, trot and folk-pop. Despite his early association with rock music as an electric guitarist in a rock band, Cho Yong-pil&#x27;s initial popularity came from his trot songs which were popular in both South Korea and Japan. For example, in 1976, his trot song, &quot;Please Return to Pusan Port&quot; () was a great hit. Despite the temporary setback due to his involvement in a marijuana incident in 1977, he managed to bounce back with the song &quot;The Woman Outside the Window&quot; which reached a record-breaking sales of 1 million in 1980. In 1988, he sang &quot;Seoul Seoul Seoul&quot; in three languages (Korean, English and Japanese) to celebrate the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.

===1990s: Development of modern K-pop===

In the 1990s, Korean pop musicians incorporated partially Europop and mostly American popular music styles such as hip hop, rock, jazz, and electronic dance in their music. In 1992, the emergence of Seo Taiji and Boys marked a revolutionary moment in the history of K-pop. The trio debuted on MBC&#x27;s talent show on April 11, 1992, with their song &quot;I Know&quot; and got the lowest rating from the jury; however, the song and their self-titled debut album became so successful that it paved the way for other songs of the same format. The song&#x27;s success was attributed to its new jack swing-inspired beats and memorable chorus, as well as innovative lyrics which dealt with the problems of Korean society. A wave of successful hip hop and R&amp;B artists followed in their footsteps, including Yoo Seung-jun, Jinusean, Solid, Deux, 1TYM and Drunken Tiger.

In 1995, South Korean record producer Lee Soo-man, who was educated in the U.S. and was exposed to the trends in American music, founded the entertainment company SM Entertainment. Former Seo Taiji &amp; Boys&#x27; member Yang Hyun-suk formed YG Entertainment in 1996, and Park Jin-young established JYP Entertainment in 1997.

The huge popularity of Seo Taiji &amp; Boys among teenagers shifted the focus of the Korean music industry to teen-centred pop music. Idol bands of young boys or girls were formed to cater to a growing teenage audience. H.O.T. was one of the first idol boybands, debuting in 1996 after rigorous training encompassing not only singing and dancing skills but also etiquette, attitude, language and the ability to deal with the media. Their song &quot;Candy&quot; presented a softer and gentler form of pop music with upbeat and cheerful melodies accompanied by energetic dance steps – a formula adopted by many subsequent idol groups. The group was hugely successful, with many fans copying the group members&#x27; hairstyles and fashion. Merchandise affiliated with the group ranging from candy to perfume were sold as well. Their success was followed by that of young male and female idol groups like Sechs Kies, S.E.S., Fin.K.L, NRG, Baby Vox, Diva, Shinhwa and g.o.d, which also became popular among the younger generation.

During the late 1990s, talent agencies began to market K-pop stars by implementing an idol business model used in J-pop, where talents are selected and trained to appeal to a global audience through formal lessons or through residency programs. The extensive and intensive process includes physical and language training (a program sometimes called abusive), and potential talents are also selected for height, being much taller on average than their Japanese counterparts. Sociology professor Ingyu Oh has explained regarding looks, &quot;K-pop emphasizes thin, tall, and feminine looks with
adolescent or sometimes very cute facial expressions, regardless of whether they&#x27;re male or female singers.&quot; Over time, Korean-American artists have become successful due to their fluency. These efforts increase the marketability of K-pop while also increasing South Korean soft power, which has become an important part of official policy.

The 1990s saw a reactionary movement against mainstream popular culture with the rise of illegal underground music clubs and punk rock bands such as Crying Nut. The 1997 Asian financial crisis not only prompted South Korean entertainers to look for new markets, with H.O.T. releasing a Mandarin-language album and Diva releasing an English-language album in Taiwan, but also prompted South Korea&#x27;s leaders to focus on building the nation&#x27;s cultural influence through music. The government poured millions into building infrastructure, technology, and a specific department within its Ministry of Culture for K-pop. Regulations were passed on karaoke bars, for example, to protect the interests of idols.

==Industry==

===Agencies===
K-pop has spawned an entire industry encompassing music production houses, event management companies, music distributors, and other merchandise and service providers. The three biggest companies in terms of sales and revenue are SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment, often referred to as the &#x27;Big Three.&#x27; These record labels also function as representative agencies for their artists. They are responsible for recruiting, financing, training, and marketing new artists as well as managing their musical activities and public relations. Currently, the agency with the greatest market share is S.M. Entertainment. In 2011, together with Star J Entertainment, AM Entertainment, and Key East, the Big Three companies founded the joint management company United Asia Management.
===Sales and market value===
In 2009, DFSB Kollective became the first distributor of K-pop on iTunes. In 2012, the average cost of obtaining a K-pop song in South Korea amounted to US$0.10 for a single download, or $0.002 when streamed online. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the Korean music industry grossed nearly US$3.4 billion in the first half of 2012—a 27.8% increase on the previous year—and was recognized by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;South Korea&#x27;s Greatest Export.&quot; In 2017, it was estimated that the K-pop music industry had a revenue of US$5 billion.

By 2019, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) listed South Korea as the 6th largest music market in the world, with BTS alone accounting for $4.65 billion, or 0.3%, of South Korea&#x27;s GDP.

===Record charts===

Korean record charts include the Circle Digital Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; K-pop Hot 100. More recently, K-pop records have appeared on the Oricon Albums Chart of Japan and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 of the United States.

The Circle Digital Chart compiles data from South Korea&#x27;s various platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, MelOn, Bugs, Vibe, Genie, Flo and Samsung Music. Some of the platforms release hourly and daily charts, which are compiled by the South Korean company iChart. There are three achievements achievable by iChart: All-Kill, Certified All-Kill, and Perfect All-Kill.

An All-Kill occurs when a song simultaneously places first on all of South Korea&#x27;s major music platforms real-time charts, a Certified All-Kill occurs when a song simultaneously places first on all of South Korea&#x27;s major music platforms real-time and daily charts. The highest achievement, a Perfect All-Kill occurs when a song simultaneously places first on South Korea&#x27;s music platforms real-time, daily and weekly charts.

&quot;Sajaegi&quot; () is the Korean term for chart manipulation by way of bulk purchasing of albums or using bots to boost streams, which has potential to question to credibility of charts.

===Trainee system===

The method of having K-pop trainees go through a rigorous training system for an undetermined amount of time before debut. This method was popularized by Lee Soo-man, founder of S.M. Entertainment, as part of a concept labelled &quot;cultural technology.&quot; &quot;The Verge&quot; described this as an &quot;extreme&quot; system of artist management. According to the CEO of Universal Music&#x27;s Southeast Asian branch, the Korean idol trainee system is unique in the world.

Due to the length of the training period, which can extend for multiple years, and the significant financial investment that agencies commit towards their trainees, the industry approaches the launching of new artists with deliberate care. SM Entertainment says that their trainee program states that the trainee period can last at least a year and a maximum of six years. Trainees may enter an agency through auditions or be scouted, and once recruited are given accommodation and classes (commonly singing, dancing, rapping, and foreign languages such as Mandarin, English and Japanese) while they prepare for debut. During their trainee days, they are tested on their vocal skills like voice tone, vocalization, and rhythm that can be adapted to the current trends at a global level. Young trainees sometimes attend school at the same time. There is no age limit to become a trainee and no limit to the duration one can spend as a trainee. There is still a chance the trainee will never make it to debut in a group after the extensive educational program.

Some young trainees have dropped out of school to start training as K-pop idols, including Rosé from Blackpink. In a Vogue Australia interview, she said, &quot;I decided to drop out of school and all my teachers and friends were like: &#x27;What?! Why are you leaving!? Nobody knew what K-pop was, so nobody understood where I was going.&quot; Leaving Melbourne at the age of 16, Rosé trained with YG Entertainment for four years before debuting with Blackpink. This isn&#x27;t uncommon—Taemin from Shinee entering the industry at 11 years old—but Rosé was one of the handful discussed the difficulty of being a trainee openly. Dr. Sarah Keith explained that idols are such a valuable asset to an agency with well rounded talent in singing, rapping, dancing, or songwriting, therefore, face restriction like the limitations of what they can say due to the agencies&#x27; significant investment.

In September 2024, Hanni from New Jeans testified to Korean lawmakers about the workplace harassment and mistreatment during her time at Hybe. In her testimony, Hanni describes being ignored by managers and sunbae (senior) idols within the company. She also wishes that younger trainees that will soon debut will not have to suffer through the incidents that the 20-year-old has been through.

In the 2020 Netflix documentary, Blackpink&#x27;s Jennie claimed that the trainee system is what defines K-pop. According to Hybe and Geffen Records, the comprehensive idol training program that has caught the global eye was Hybe&#x27;s formation of Katseye, the 2024 global girl group. Katseye is the multiracial, English language girl group that was modeled off of the K-pop principles. Through this global competition reality show in 2023, Debut: Dream Academy, Netflix depicted the girls&#x27; experiences in the auditions and their trainee journey to becoming an idol in a documentary series, Pop Star Academy: KATSEYE. In the 8 episode series, Mitra, the president of HXG at Hybe America, said, &quot;A survival show is created because there is a section in the K-pop fan base that gets in early with the trainees.&quot; The goal of Hybe X Geffen&#x27;s efforts was to take the &quot;K&quot; out of K-pop to build a talent pipeline of diverse skills and cultures as the next step in the evolution of K-pop. Nadia Hallgren, director of the docuseries, hoped that viewers can learn that &quot;[y]ou can have all the talent in the world, you could have the best training and the fancy schools, if you have access, but can you mentally push through to get to the end?” and she describes the key takeaway is through these trainees, you can understand the lengths that one will go to reach their dream of becoming an artist. After 120,000 submissions, 20 finalist were narrowed down and viewers got to take part in voting for their favorite trainees. Through different &quot;challenges&quot; the trainees were able to have the opportunity to showcase their personality and talent to the public.

The fan voting system created tension and competition between the girls. Eliminations were significant turning points as contestants aspired to become a popstar by dropped out of high school to participate in this survival show. Sophia Laforteza, one of the members that debuted said, &quot;The whole experience was just so much tension, so much uncertainty, and so much competition and pressure.&quot;

In 1959, Motown was founded by Berry Gordy Jr in Detroit, Michigan. He created Motown artist like Martha and the Vandellas, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Gladys Knight and the Pips, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye. Gordy would write songs, train them, produce, and work on his artists&#x27; individual sound. Motown would guide and direct the artists and groups towards success by overseeing many aspects of career. JYP referenced Berry Gordy&#x27;s training system in order to create his own trainee system at JYP Entertainment. As a guest on YouTube episode talkshow series, Joon &amp; Brian BYOB, JYP said, &quot;I learned it from the US, but US stopped doing it and we kept doing it. That&#x27;s what happened.&quot; He also expressed his thoughts that K-pop could work in America through his trainee system. &quot;And now, we basically casted American talents and made them into a group with our system.&quot; (referring to the girl group, VCHA) JYP told CNBC that he is looking to move to the next stage by finding foreign talent because the industry can&#x27;t &quot;keep sending over Korean stars forever...&quot;

=== Television ===

The Korean music industry has spawned numerous related reality TV shows, including talent shows such as &quot;Superstar K&quot; and &quot;K-pop Star&quot;, specialist rap competition &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; and its female counterpart &quot;Unpretty Rapstar,&quot; and many &#x27;survival&#x27; shows, which commonly pit trainees against each other in order to form a new idol group.

Examples of survival shows include Jellyfish Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;MyDOL&quot;, which formed boy group VIXX; &quot;Sixteen&quot;, which formed girl group Twice; Starship Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;No.Mercy&quot;, which formed boy group Pentagon, and Mnet&#x27;s &quot;Produce 101&quot;, which formed girl groups I.O.I and Iz*One and boy groups Wanna One and X1.

The rise in these shows, which often involves larger agencies contracting smaller agencies&#x27; trainees into project groups and taking a larger portion of the revenues, has led to criticisms over the former monopolizing the industry.

=== Criticism of industry practices ===
====Hybrid identity====
There have been critical responses in South Korea regarding the identity of the genre since its ascendance. Some of the notable music critics in the region have criticized K-pop as &quot;an industrial label mainly designed to promote the national brand in the global market from the beginning&quot; and argued that it was &quot;not formed spontaneously as a pop culture but created with the orchestrated plan led by the government with commercial considerations&quot; although in fact &quot;the genre has practically no ties with traditional Korean identity.&quot; There is the perspective that the name of the genre was derived from J-pop.

K-pop has at times faced criticisms from journalists who perceive the music to be formulaic and unoriginal. Some K-Pop groups have been accused of plagiarizing Western music acts as well as other musical acts. In addition, K-pop has been criticized for its reliance on English phrases, with critics dubbing the use of English in titles &quot;meaningless.&quot;

K-pop groups have been regularly accused of cultural appropriation of cultures such as African-American culture, especially due to the frequent use of cornrows and bandanas in idol groups&#x27; on-stage styling. Some have used blackface and racial slurs as part of their performances. K-Pop groups have also been accused of appropriating Native American and Indian cultures. However, debate exists about whether the borrowing of cultural elements from cultures outside of Korea indeed constitutes cultural appropriation, or if this cultural appropriation is negative at all. Scholar Crystal S. Anderson writes that &quot;appropriating elements of a culture by taking them out of their original context and using them in a completely different way does not automatically constitute negative cultural appropriation.&quot;

==== Corruption ====
In 2002, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Korean television producers such as Hwang Yong-woo and Kim Jong-jin had been arrested for &quot;accepting under-the-table payments guaranteeing TV appearances to aspiring singers and musicians&quot; in a bid to tackle &quot;systemic corruption in South Korea&#x27;s music business.&quot; Companies investigated included SidusHQ and SM Entertainment.

==== Working conditions ====
K-pop management companies have also been criticized for exploitation of idols through overwork and restrictive contracts, described as &quot;slave contracts&quot; in a &quot;BBC&quot; report. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Korea&#x27;s entertainment business is notoriously improvisational and unregulated. In-demand K-pop stars – many of whom are teenage &#x27;idols&#x27; – have been known to rehearse and perform without sleep.&quot;

In July 2009, S.M. Entertainment was taken to court by TVXQ and a Super Junior member, who alleged that their working conditions had led to adverse health effects. The court decision in the TVXQ lawsuit determined their contract with S.M. Entertainment void, and resultantly the Fair Trade Commission released contract templates to regulate industry conditions.

In 2014, South Korea passed a law to regulate its music industry, protecting idols aged under 19 from unhealthy labor practices and overtly sexualized performances and guaranteeing them &quot;the basic rights to learn, rest and sleep.&quot; Failure to comply with these regulations may lead to the equivalent of a US$10,000 fine.

Industry professionals such as SM Entertainment&#x27;s CEO Kim Young-min have defended the system, arguing that individuals trained within the system are &quot;no different than typical middle or high school kids, who go to after-school programs to cram for college entrance exams.&quot; Kim has also argued that there is a need to consider the expenses incurred by the company during the trainee period, including &quot;facilities, equipment, costumes, and virtually everything the trainees need.&quot;

On March 7, 2017, the South Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) passed new regulations in order to protect trainee idols from unfair terms and working conditions. Prior to these regulations, trainee idols at eight idol agencies were not permitted to seek contracts at any other agency while at training. Moreover, agencies were able to terminate a trainee contract at any time for any reason. The Fair Trade Commission states that they believe these changes will &quot;result in a more just contract culture within the entertainment industry between trainee and agency.&quot; The Ministry of Culture applied these regulations to all existing agencies throughout 2018.

Some of the concerns raised by the idol agencies over these regulations include the risk of a trainee at one agency going undercover at another agency to receive training with the other agency. This introduces the further risk that the idol agencies must take in training new idols. Trainees train for 3 years on average and the agencies support these trainees with various training programs during this duration, resulting in each trainee being a very large investment for the agency.

==== Control over public image ====
K-pop management is very strict in terms of regulating the public appearance of their groups, according to Michael Hurt, a lecturer of cultural theory at the Korea National University of Arts. Therefore, he reasoned, most stars are not allowed to date publicly or have &quot;control of their own lives&quot;. Kwon Joon-won, an entertainment management professor at the Dong-ah Institute of Media and Arts, said K-pop stars should be expected to lose half of their fandom if they were to make controversial statements. This may explain why K-pop groups are more outspoken about social issues abroad than within South Korea.

==== Sexualization and pressure on appearance ====
The industry has been criticized for the sexualization of both male and female idols, with the sexualization of minors in particular being of concern. Critics such as James Turnbull of the Korean Pop Culture blog The Grand Narrative have argued young female idols are especially susceptible to pressures to wear revealing clothing or dance provocatively. However, compared to western popular music, K-pop has little sex, drugs, or aggressive behavior and has a much more parent-friendly branding. In 2014, South Korea passed a law to protect idols under the age of 19 from overtly sexualized performances.

Questions have also been raised over K-pop&#x27;s focus on appearance and its effects on children and teens, especially pressure to obtain cosmetic surgeries. In 2019, the South Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family announced non-mandatory guidelines in an effort to prevent &quot;lookism.&quot; One recommendation asked to limit how many idol singers can appear on TV together, saying &quot;most of them are skinny ... with outfits exposing their bodies.&quot; The concern was that their nearly identical appearances would narrow the standards of beauty. Many young viewers of K-pop are raised in a culture where cosmetic surgery is promoted. Some idols openly document themselves undergoing surgery. The government recommendations upset many fans, however, who began circulating an online petition in protest. An opposition politician also compared the guidelines to regulations under the &quot;military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan&quot;.

==== Mental health and suicides ====
Some K-pop artists have suggested that the uncertainty and pressures of their jobs as entertainers may be detrimental to their mental health. According to musician Park Kyung of Block B, &quot;There are many people who debuted with no sense of self yet, and they come to realize later that every move and every word they say is being observed so they become cautious and lose their freedom.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Yonhap News&quot;, Suga of BTS talked about his own mental health, and said, &quot;Anxiety and loneliness seem to be with me for life…Emotions are so different in every situation and every moment, so I think to agonise every moment is what life is.&quot;

The suicides of prominent K-pop musicians have drawn attention to both industry and societal pressures. In 1996, singer Charles Park, also known as , died by suicide at the age of 19, before the release of his second album. Kim Jong-hyun, who had previously been open about his history of depression, also died by suicide in December 2017. In the spring of 2018, a number of prominent Korean musicians participated in a free concert series to raise awareness of suicide prevention. In 2019 Sulli, a member of the girl group f(x), took her life and was followed one month later by her close friend Goo Hara. Both were subjected to cyberbullying, which added to calls for reform. In 2023, the death of Moonbin renewed scrutiny on the highly competitive world of Korean show business and the pressures its performers face.

One reason is that K-pop amplifies the pressure to be perfect, already intense in Korean society. After dating fellow musician Choiza, Sulli became the center of online abuse because K-pop idols are expected not to be in a relationship for years. During one talk show, she expressed how empty her life was, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.&quot; A jewellery designer who works with K-pop stars, including Sulli, said that receiving threats and angry mail is normal for many idols.

==Culture==
K-pop artists are frequently referred to as idols or idol groups. Groups usually have a leader, who is often the eldest or most experienced member and speaks for the group. The youngest group member is called the &quot;maknae&quot; (). The popular use of this term in Japan was influenced by boy group SS501 when they expanded their activities in the country in 2007. Its Japanese translation &quot;man&#x27;ne&quot; () was often used to name the group&#x27;s youngest member Kim Hyung-jun in order to differentiate him from their leader with a similar name and spelling, Kim Hyun-joong.

==Impact and popularity==
==Foreign relations==
On May 25, 2010, South Korea responded to the alleged North Korean sinking of a navy ship by broadcasting 4Minute&#x27;s single &quot;HuH&quot; across the DMZ. In response, North Korea affirmed its decision to &quot;destroy&quot; any speakers set up along the border. That year, &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; reported that the Ministry of National Defense had considered setting up large TV screens across the border to broadcast music videos by several popular K-pop girl groups such as Girls&#x27; Generation, Wonder Girls, After School, Kara and 4Minute as part of &quot;psychological warfare&quot; against North Korea.

In September 2012, North Korea uploaded a video with a manipulated image of South Korean president Park Geun-hye performing the dance moves of &quot;Gangnam Style.&quot; The video labeled her as a &quot;devoted&quot; admirer of the Yusin system of autocratic rule set up by her father, Park Chung Hee.Since the early 2010s, several political leaders have acknowledged the global rise of Korean pop culture, most notably U.S. President Barack Obama, who made an official visit to South Korea in 2012 and mentioned the strong influences of social media networks, adding that it was &quot;no wonder so many people around the world have caught the Korean wave, &quot;Hallyu&quot;.&quot; A few months later, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a speech in front of the National Assembly of South Korea, where he noted South Korea&#x27;s &quot;great global success&quot; in the fields of culture, sports and the arts, before pointing out that the Korean Wave was &quot;making its mark on the world.&quot; This occurred a few days after U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland remarked in a daily press briefing that her daughter &quot;loves Korean pop,&quot; which sparked a media frenzy in South Korea after a journalist from the country&#x27;s publicly funded Yonhap News Agency arranged an interview with Nuland and described Nuland&#x27;s teenage daughter as &quot;crazy about Korean music and dance.&quot;

In November 2012, the British Minister of State for the Foreign Office, Hugo Swire, addressed a group of South Korean diplomats at the House of Lords, where he emphasized the close ties and mutual cooperation shaping South Korea–United Kingdom relations and added: &quot;As &#x27;Gangnam Style&#x27; has demonstrated, your music is global too.&quot; In February 2013, the Vice President of Peru, Marisol Espinoza, gave an interview with South Korea&#x27;s Yonhap News Agency, where she voiced her desire for more South Korean companies to invest in her country and named K-pop as &quot;one of the main factors that made Peruvian people wanting to get to know South Korea more.&quot;

According to an article published by the international relations magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, the spread of Korean popular culture across Southeast Asia, parts of South America, and parts of the Middle East are illustrating how the gradual cessation of European colonialism is giving way and making room for unexpected soft power outside of the Western world. On the other hand, an article published by &quot;The Quietus&quot; magazine expressed concern that discussions about &quot;Hallyu&quot; as a form of soft power seems to bear a whiff of the &quot;old Victorian fear of Yellow Peril.&quot;

In August 2016, China proceeded to restrict Korean media, including K-pop, to protest South Korea&#x27;s of deployment of U.S. THAAD systems. The move, which lasted until 2017, had a negative impact on the shares of Korean talent agencies, although prices later recovered.

On April 1, 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hosted a K-pop concert in Pyongyang.

<text>is a town located in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 26,542 in 10,618 households, and a population density of 170 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Fujikawaguchiko is located in southern Yamanashi Prefecture, in the foothills of Mount Fuji. Three of the Fuji Five Lakes (Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Sai and Lake Shōji) are located in Fujikawaguchiko. Lake Motosu is shared with neighboring Minobu.

Yamanashi Prefecture:
*Fuefuki
*Fujiyoshida

===Climate===
Fujikawaguchiko features a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Dfb&quot;) that closely borders on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) and an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Fujikawaguchiko is 10.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1663 mm with September as the wettest month.


==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Fujikawaguchiko grown slightly in recent decades.

==History==
The area around Lake Kawaguchi has been inhabited since at least the Jōmon period. It was on the road connecting Kai Province with Suruga Province, and is mentioned in Heian period records, which also document an eruption of Mount Fuji in 864 AD. During the Edo period, all of Kai Province was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period on July 1, 1889, the area came under the jurisdiction of Minamitsuru District, Yamanashi Prefecture.

On 15 November 2003, the town of Kawaguchiko, and the villages of Katsuyama and Ashiwada merged to form the new town of Fujikawaguchiko. The headquarters of the infamous Aum Shinrikyo was located in the village of Kamikuishiki, most of which was absorbed into Fujikawaguchiko on 1 March 2006.

In May 2024, Fujikawaguchiko erected a large black barrier to block the iconic view of Mount Fuji due to a surge in tourists drawn by the town&#x27;s popularity on social media platforms like Instagram. Installed on May 21, this measure followed complaints of disruptive behavior from tourists, including harassment of locals, littering, and trespassing. Even businesses unrelated to tourism, such as a dental clinic, had been affected, prompting them to seek intervention from local authorities. Unlike specific attractions, Fujikawaguchiko&#x27;s issue stems from a viewpoint favored for capturing Mount Fuji, located in front of a convenience store. Most visitors opt for day trips, contributing to traffic congestion and environmental damage without significant financial benefits to the town.

==Education==

Fujikawaguchiko has eight public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government, along with one private elementary school and one private junior high school. The town has one public high school operated by the Yamanashi Prefectural Board of Education. The Health Science University, a private medical school, is located in Fujikawaguchiko.
