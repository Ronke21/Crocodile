<text>Kielder Water is a large man-made reservoir in Northumberland in North East England. It is the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity of water and it is surrounded by Kielder Forest, one of the biggest man-made woodlands in Europe. The scheme was planned in the late 1960s to satisfy an expected rise in demand for water to support a booming UK industrial economy. But the decline of traditional heavy industry, together with more water-efficient industrial processes and better control of water supply leakage, served to undermine the original justification for the reservoir and the government-funded project has been criticised as a white elephant.

Kielder Water is owned by Northumbrian Water, and holds , making it the largest artificial reservoir in the UK by capacity (Rutland Water is the largest by surface area). It has a shoreline, is from the sea, and has a maximum depth of 52 metres (170 ft).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kielder&quot; was first recorded in 1309 as &quot;Keldre&quot;. Originating as a river name, &quot;Kielder&quot; may have the same origin as the various rivers named &quot;Calder&quot;, such as the one in West Yorkshire. The name may be derived from the Brittonic &quot;caleto-/ā&quot;, with the root sense of &quot;hard&quot; (Welsh &quot;caled&quot;), suffixed with &quot;-duβr&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot; (Welsh &quot;dwr&quot;).

Derivation from the Gaelic &quot;caol dobhar&quot; meaning &quot;narrow stream&quot; has also been suggested.

==Construction==

After the scheme was approved by Parliament in 1974, work to build the reservoir and the dam at the hamlet of Yarrow in the Kielder Valley began in 1975. The reservoir and dam were designed for Northumbrian Water by consulting civil engineers Babtie, Shaw and Morton. Sir Frederick Gibberd and Partners were responsible for architectural aspects. Earth moving and infrastructure construction was undertaken in a joint venture with AMEC and Balfour Beatty.

The design meant the loss of numerous farms and a school. About 95 people had been resident in the area prior to its development. The former permanent way of the Border Counties Railway was also taken away through the development of the reservoir.

Work was completed in 1981. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the project the following year. The valley took a further two years to fill with water completely.

==Operations==
The reservoir&#x27;s purpose is to provide compensating discharges into the Kielder Transfer Scheme, where water can be transferred to the North Tyne, Wear and the Tees to support abstractions of water further downstream while maintaining minimum acceptable levels in the rivers in times of drought.

There are two main visitor centres at Kielder Water – Leaplish waterside park and Tower Knowe visitor centre – and other facilities at Kielder, Falstone and Stannersburn villages. It is also one of the region&#x27;s major tourist venues, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year who come to enjoy the facilities.

==Hydroelectric plant==
Kielder Water is also the site of England&#x27;s largest hydroelectric plant. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1982 and is owned by Northumbrian Water. In December 2005, RWE Npower Renewables bought the rights to operate the plant and sell the electricity generated by it, with a contract lasting until 2025. Following the takeover, the turbines were refurbished in 2005–2006, which increased the efficiency of the electricity generation. Controls were also updated, so that the plant can be operated from Dolgarrog in Wales.

The plant generates electricity using dual turbines which produce six megawatts of electricity. This comes from a combination of a 5.5 MW Kaplan turbine, which generates electricity when water release takes place, and a 500 kW Francis turbine that generates constantly from the compensation flow of water from the reservoir into the North Tyne. This gives the reservoir an average production of 20,000 MWh of electricity per year, a saving of 8,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to fossil fuel based methods of generation.

<text>Álvaro de Soto Polar (born 16 March 1943) is a Peruvian diplomat. He ended a 25-year career with the United Nations in May 2007.

==Early years and family==
He is the brother of the economist Hernando de Soto.

After attending the International School of Geneva, de Soto studied law and international relations in Lima at the University of San Marcos and in Geneva at the Graduate Institute of International Studies prior to enlisting in his country&#x27;s diplomatic corps. Prior to his secondment to the United Nations, he worked for Peru&#x27;s foreign ministry in Lima and at its UN missions in New York City and Geneva.

==United Nations career==

In 1982 he joined the United Nations staff as a special adviser to Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. Following his appointment as the Secretary-General&#x27;s Personal Representative for the Central American Peace Process, Ambassador de Soto headed the 1990–1991 negotiations that brought an end to the decade-long civil war in El Salvador.

He was a Senior Political Adviser to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali from February 1992 to December 1994. He then served as Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, in charge of the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific, from 1995 to 1999. In 1997 Secretary-General Kofi Annan chose him as his Special Envoy for Myanmar, a position he held until 1999.

===Cyprus===
On 1 November 1999 de Soto was selected as the Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Adviser on Cyprus, with the rank of Under-Secretary-General; he held this post until the dismantling of the Special Mission to Cyprus following the April 2004 rejection of the Annan Plan for a Cypriot bizonal bicommunal federation divided along ethnic and religious lines. 

===Middle East===
On 6 May 2005 he was appointed the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. In May 2007 he resigned from the position. He wrote a 53-page End of Mission statement, dated 5 May, &quot;meant only for senior UN officials&quot;, with &quot;wording far more critical than the public pronouncements of UN diplomats&quot;. It was leaked to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and published on 13 June. De Soto has confirmed the authenticity of the &quot;Guardian&quot; text. He criticized both the Palestinian organizations Hamas and Fatah and the Israeli government, as well as the international community. He condemned the sanctions imposed by Israel, EU, and US, against Palestine after Hamas won the election. He warned &quot;that American pressure has &#x27;pummelled into submission&#x27; the UN&#x27;s role as an impartial Middle East negotiator.&quot; 
==Other activities==

Álvaro de Soto is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today’s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

<doc id="618530" wikidata="Q7822619" url="?curid=618530" title="Tony Ianno">
<text>Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Ianno (born 1957) is a businessman and a former Canadian politician. He served as a Liberal Party of Canada MP representing Trinity—Spadina (1993–2006) and Minister of Families and Caregivers (2004–06).

==Personal life==
Born on January 2, 1957, in Toronto, Ontario, Ianno graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Science degree. He and his wife, Christine Innes, have four children. He is also the cousin of former Ontario MPP and cabinet minister Joseph Cordiano. His wife, Christine, was the Liberal candidate for Trinity-Spadina in the 2008 federal election and 2011 federal election.

==Politics==
Ianno was a long-time political organizer and helped a number of Italian-Canadians win federal and provincial Liberal nominations in Toronto in the 1980s. He also was a key figure in organizing support among Toronto&#x27;s large Italian-Canadian population for Jean Chrétien during the 1990 Liberal leadership campaign.

He first ran for Federal office in the 1988 election, as part of a group of four Liberals who, according to author William Johnson, &quot;brought a new turbulence to the politics of Metro Toronto.&quot; The group, which included Joe Volpe, Armindo Silva, and Jasbir Singh, worked together and used aggressive tactics to secure nominations in the Toronto area. Ianno was nominated in the Toronto riding of Trinity-Spadina, but was defeated by New Democratic Party incumbent Dan Heap.

He ran again in the 1993 election and was elected in a Liberal sweep where they won nearly every seat in Ontario. Ianno continued to represent Trinity-Spadina for the next 13 years until he was defeated in 2006.

While most Ontario seats were easily won by the Liberals under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Trinity—Spadina was closely fought each time. Ianno narrowly held the diverse downtown riding through four federal elections, facing strong competition from New Democratic Party candidates. Much of his support came from the Italian, Portuguese and Chinese areas. Toronto&#x27;s traditional Little Italy and Chinatown areas are in the riding. Ianno narrowly defeated Toronto city councillor Olivia Chow in the 1997 election and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; journalist Michael Valpy who ran for the NDP in the 2000 election. In the 2004 election, Ianno again faced councillor Chow and managed to win re-election by a slim margin, as the Liberals were reduced to a minority government due to the Sponsorship Scandal.

On July 20, 2004, Ianno was appointed to the junior position of Minister of State (Families and Caregivers) in Paul Martin&#x27;s cabinet following the Liberals&#x27; re-election.

During the 2006 election, Ianno faced off against Chow for the third time. This time she defeated him, winning 46% of the vote to Ianno&#x27;s 40%. Some attributed Ianno&#x27;s loss to his perceived support for the Toronto Port Authority and the Toronto City Centre Airport. Although Ianno did not have an official role in the Authority&#x27;s creation or policies, he nonetheless defended a controversial payout to the Authority as compensation for the cancellation of the Island Airport Bridge.

His party&#x27;s proposal redress the Head Tax also did not help his campaign, as the Liberals had not consulted many of the major Canadian-Chinese groups (despite claiming to), the promised amount was reduced to from $12.5 million to $2.5 million, and the pre-condition was that the government would make no apology, while the three opposition parties pledged to make a full apology. Several gaffes by the Liberals also reflected negatively on Ianno, including when Mike Klander (the executive vice-president of the federal Liberals&#x27; Ontario wing) made posts on his blog comparing Chow to a Chow Chow dog and calling her husband an &quot;asshole&quot;. Klander apologized for the remark and resigned.

==Later life==
After the election, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported on February 11, 2006 that Ianno had been &quot;burning up the caucus phone lines&quot; testing the waters for a possible bid in the Liberal leadership campaign to replace Martin. On April 8, 2006, Mr. Ianno told Canadian Press that he decided to run for the party presidency, in which he was unsuccessful.

On March 9, 2010, the Ontario Securities Commission made allegations of market manipulation based on what they deemed &quot;acting against public interest&quot; against Ianno. Ianno has denied the charges. The matter was heard before the commission in September 2011. Ianno accepted a plea deal which had him pay a $100,000 fine and was banned from working as a stock trader for five years.

<text>Kill Uncle is the second solo studio album by the English alternative rock singer Morrissey, released on 4 March 1991 by EMI Records and His Master&#x27;s Voice. The title comes from the black comedy film &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Uncle&quot; (1966).

== Recording ==
&quot;Kill Uncle&quot; was recorded during a transitional phase for Morrissey, having parted ways with record producer Stephen Street but not yet working with his future long-term team of guitarists Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer. The album was produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley with most of the music written by Fairground Attraction&#x27;s guitarist Mark E. Nevin.

== Content ==
The opening track, &quot;Our Frank&quot;, describes &quot;frank and open, deep conversations&quot; that get the singer nowhere and leave him disheartened. The final verse, however, sees Morrissey singing &quot;Won&#x27;t somebody stop me from thinking? From thinking all the time. So deeply, so bleakly ...&quot;, which critic David Thompson interprets as indicating that the conversations he so dreads are in fact with himself.

&quot;Asian Rut&quot; tells of the murder of an Asian boy by three English boys, in which Morrissey&#x27;s vocals are backed only by strings, bass, and sound effects. The song continues the trope of Morrissey writing about English racism from a unique angle, as with &quot;Bengali in Platforms&quot; on his debut solo studio album &quot;Viva Hate&quot; (1988).

&quot;Sing Your Life&quot; has Morrissey encouraging the listener to express themselves, as he sings, &quot;Walk right up to the microphone and name all the things you love, all the things you loathe.&quot; A rockabilly version of the song also exists, recorded live at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles after Morrissey started working with new guitarists Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte.

&quot;Mute Witness&quot; tells of an attempt to get information out of a shocked witness who cannot speak at a trial, featuring piano backing composed by Clive Langer. &quot;King Leer&quot; follows, a relaxed tune with sardonic lyrical puns. &quot;Found Found Found&quot;, another Langer track, is the only heavy song on the album. Morrissey sings that he&#x27;s found &quot;someone who&#x27;s worth it in this murkiness&quot; but ends complaining this person is &quot;somebody who wants to be with me... all the time&quot;.

&quot;Driving Your Girlfriend Home&quot; is a ballad in which Morrissey tells of driving home the girlfriend of an unspecified person. He reveals she asks him, &quot;&#x27;How did I end up so deeply involved in the very existence I planned on avoiding?&#x27;&quot; and that &quot;She&#x27;s laughing to stop herself crying.&quot; These outpourings are interspersed with directional instructions. Morrissey tells us &quot;I can&#x27;t tell her&quot; the answer to her question and that the ride concludes with them &quot;shaking hands goodnight so politely.&quot;

The next track, &quot;The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye&quot;, is often cited as Morrissey&#x27;s most misunderstood song. The lyric is describing the &quot;pain because of the strain of smiling&quot; and the dichotomy between one&#x27;s public image and private personality. The music consists of a carnival-like synthesizer and also features sound effects like a door slamming and a camera shutter snapping, along with piano accompaniment.

In &quot;(I&#x27;m) The End of the Family Line&quot;, the singer rues he will never have children, an insult into the &quot;fifteen generations... of mine&quot; that produced him. The lyric is complemented by a subdued guitar backing, and ends with a similar &#x27;false&#x27; fadeout similar to such Smiths songs as &quot;That Joke Isn&#x27;t Funny Anymore&quot;.

The original album closes with &quot;There Is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends&quot;, a simple piano piece that reflects the existential longing of the album and showcases Morrissey&#x27;s torch song influence. This version was replaced in the 2013 expanded edition by the recording from the three-song live EP &quot;At KROQ&quot;.

The 2013 expanded edition of the album added the songs &quot;East West&quot; and &quot;Pashernate Love&quot;, as well as changing the running order of some tracks.

== Release ==
&quot;Kill Uncle&quot; was released on 4 March 1991 by record labels EMI and His Master&#x27;s Voice.

&quot;Our Frank&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single and opening track, reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 2 in the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Sing Your Life&quot; was also released as a single, reaching No. 33 in the UK and No. 10 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.

On 5 February 2013, Morrissey announced the reissue of the album along with a remastered version of his 1989 single &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot;, both to be released 8 April 2013. This was as part of a Morrissey reissue campaign by Parlophone. This version of the album includes three additional tracks and is available as a gatefold CD and heavyweight gatefold LP. The picture disc single and album feature new cover artworks. The press release mentioned that &quot;the album has a revitalised quality, which accentuates some of its more subtle, experimental qualities and nuances; in particular, some of the more unusual musical styles which Morrissey explored for the first time&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Kill Uncle&quot; has generally divided opinion amongst music critics.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic panned the album, describing it as &quot;Morrissey&#x27;s least distinguished record&quot; with &quot;neither melody nor much wit&quot;. Mark Hogan of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the album &quot;is best appreciated as a campy celebration of the decorative and artificial.&quot; Mat Snow in &quot;Q&quot; magazine described it as &quot;further evidence of woodworm in the creative rafters&quot; and highlighted the short running time of the album.

<doc id="618536" wikidata="Q17022162" url="?curid=618536" title="Telesoftware">
<text>The term telesoftware was coined by W.J.G. Overington who invented the concept in 1974; it literally means “software at a distance” and it often refers to the transmission of programs for a microprocessor or home computer via broadcast teletext, though the use of teletext was just a convenient way to implement the invention, which had been invented as a theoretical broadcasting concept previously. The concept being of producing local interactivity without the need for a return information link to a central computer. The invention arose as spin-off from research on function generators for a hybrid computer system for use in simulation of heat transfer in food preservation, and thus from outside of the broadcasting research establishments. 

Software bytes are presented to a terminal as pairs of standard teletext characters, thus utilizing an existing and well-proven broadcasting system.

==History==
Telesoftware was pioneered in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, and a paper on the subject was presented by R.H. Vivian (IBA) and W.J.G. Overington at the 1978 International Broadcasting Convention.

The world first test broadcast took place on ITV Oracle in February 1977, though there was no equipment available to use the software at that time. The broadcast simply produced a display of the encoded software, for a Signetics 2650 microprocessor, on a teletext television. However, the fact that the broadcast took place gave the concept practical credibility of something that was realistically possible for the future.

At the 1978 International Broadcasting Convention a demonstration of telesoftware working from a live feed of ITV Oracle teletext was presented on an exhibition stand by Mr Hedger. The Oracle signal being carried within the ITV signal. At one stage the ITV signal was routed via a communication satellite as part of a television demonstration, and the opportunity was used to test telesoftware using that signal that had been routed via the communication satellite, and it worked well.

Also, a display maquette, with the title Telesoftware Tennis had been broadcast live for a few minutes on ITV Oracle in November or December 1976. Although that was just during a discussion of the future possibilities for telesoftware, the development in the 21st century of retrieving teletext pages from super-VHS recordings means that if anyone was recording the ITV television broadcast on super-VHS videotape at that time, then that maquette page could potentially be recovered from the tape by teletext archaeologists, as potentially could the broadcasts from 1977 mentioned above and the broadcasts made in 1978 at the time of the International Broadcasting Convention. Such technique has already been used to recover and archive telesoftware broadcasts made in the 1980s by the BBC.

During that time, software was broadcast at various times on all of the (then) four terrestrial TV channels. Telesoftware and tutorials were available on Ceefax (BBC teletext service) for the BBC Micro via its teletext adapter between 1983 and 1989 and was generally transmitted for a period of one week. The BBC Ceefax Telesoftware service was managed by Jeremy Brayshaw. Most of the Telesoftware programming tutorials were written by Gordon Horsington and they, as well as most of the software, are still available from the online Telesoftware archives (see the external links below). Gathering of the software (often referred to as &quot;downloading&quot;, though, as there was no uplink request needed nor used, not really &quot;downloading&quot; as such) could take place from Friday evening to the following Thursday evening. As the updating took place on a Friday, it was advised not to attempt to gather the software between 9am and 7pm on Fridays.

Other channels provided for several other computers via a range of adapters and set-top boxes. The same delivery system was also used to deliver satellite weather images from the Meteosat satellite for download.

Although none of the early telesoftware initiatives survived, many of the techniques are now at the heart of the latest digital television systems.

Various archives of BBC Ceefax Telesoftware are preserved on the internet.

<doc id="618542" wikidata="Q188901" url="?curid=618542" title="Sorocaba">
<text>Sorocaba () is a municipality in the interior of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. With over 723,000 inhabitants, it is the seventh-largest city in the state and the second-largest outside the Greater São Paulo region, ranking behind only Campinas. It forms its own Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba, comprising 27 municipalities with a total population of 2 million inhabitants, the 15th most populous in Brazil.

With a surface area of 450,38 km² (or about 170 sq mi), Sorocaba is integrated with Greater São Paulo and the Metropolitan Regions of Campinas, Jundiaí, Paraíba Valley and North Coast and Baixada Santista, forming the São Paulo macrometropolis, which is home to over 30 million people, about three quarters of the state&#x27;s population and the first such urban agglomeration in the Southern Hemisphere.

The city is highly industrialized, with its industrial production reaching over 120 countries and a GDP of over R$ 32 billion, the 19th-largest in Brazil, surpassing state capitals such as São Luís, Belém, Vitória, Natal, and Florianópolis. Over 22,000 companies operate in the city, 2,000 of which are industries.

==History==

Dom Francisco de Sousa, general governor of Brazil (1591 to 1602), believing in the existence of gold in the region, settled the Pelourinho —a Portuguese translation of the English &quot;pillory&quot;, symbol of the Royal power, as the village Nova Vila de Nossa Senhora da Ponte de Mont Serrat. When gold wasn&#x27;t found there, the governor returned to the Royal Court. Twelve years later, Dom Francisco de Sousa changed the name of the village to Itavuvu.

Baltasar Fernandes, a member of an expeditionary group called Bandeirantes, laid the foundation of Sorocaba in the 1654. The chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ponte (which is now the Cathedral located in Fernando Prestes square, downtown) was built by him, along with the São Bento de Parnaíba monastery (now São Bento monastery) years later. It was also Fernandes who brought the first Benedictine monks to teach, assist the poor and the ill, and convert the Native Americans of the region. The monastery was donated to the Benedictines in the year 1660, after which Friar Anselmo da Anunciação and Friar Mauro were chosen to take office. The first streets and houses started to spread around the neighborhood.

In the year of 1661, Baltasar Fernandes went to São Paulo to request that Sorocaba be named a village from the governor, Correia de Sá e Benevides. Thus, on March 3, 1661, Sorocaba became known as Vila de Nossa Senhora da Ponte de Sorocaba. The organization of the Municipal Council followed shortly, with the main nominees being: Baltasar Fernandes and André de Zunega (judges), Cláudio Furquim and Pascoal Leite Pais (city councillors), Domingos Garcia (procurator) and Francisco Sanches (clerk).

With the arrival of colonel Cristóvão Pereira de Abreu and his troops in 1773, begins the main chapter of the history of Sorocaba: the Tropeirismo.

The transportation of goods on the back of mules, that traversed the North-South route of the country came across Sorocaba, which was strategically placed in the main route between Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Soon Sorocaba had its own Feira de Muares (mule/horse fair), where troops from all states came to feed and rest their cavalry on the way to the mineral and forest expeditions, and buy and sell goods, horses and enslaved Africans. Given the growing number of people working in the city, the commerce and the first industries began to appear. Goods bought in Sorocaba were known from across the Country, spread by the merchant troops. The main events of Tropeirismo comprehended a hundred years of the Sorocaba history, from 1770 to 1870. The Tropeirismo is also responsible for spreading a locally manufactured type of Knife that became known in Brazil is as the Sorocaban Knife.

During the American Civil War, English textile industries ran out of cotton, which was imported from the Southern United States. Soon, manufactures from England started to search around the world for alternative places to cultivate cotton - one of them was the then-Province of São Paulo, which included Sorocaba. In 1862, Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco Gonçalves de Oliveira Machado started the first cotton plantation in Sorocaba. The local environment and weather were ideal, and the plantation flourished. The first harvest exceeded all expectations, starting another cycle of industrial and economic development. Several textile industries from England built branches in the city, changing the landscape with chimneys, saw-styled roofs, large, orange brick-built buildings and smoke. During this time, Sorocaba received the title of Manchester Paulista--&quot;São Paulo native&quot; in Portuguese, given the resemblance with its laboring twin city.

With the opening of the Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana on June 20, 1872 and its transport of cotton products, animals and passengers to São Paulo, Sorocaba had a major leap in development. Six locomotives and 62 bandwagons were brought from England, with seven stations initially planned.

Telegraphic services started on April 3, 1873. Years later, the railway expanded to the borders of the state, with Sorocaba station as the hub.

==Geography==

===Location===
The city is located in the southeastern region of the state of São Paulo, 92 km away from the state capital. The main highways are Castelo Branco (SP-280) and Raposo Tavares (SP-270). It straddles the Sorocaba River, a tributary of the left bank of the Tiete river. The municipality of Sorocaba is located on the Tropic of Capricorn, at latitude 23° 26 &#x27;16 &quot; for the season of 2011, passes along the neighborhoods of Aparecidinha and Parque São Bento districts. At the junction of Highway José Ermírio José de Morais (SP-75) with the connection to the Raposo Tavares highway is a milestone signaling the Tropic. Among Brazil&#x27;s largest cities (by population), Sorocaba is in 30th place. Sorocaba is among the major cities in São Paulo (population), is ranked ninth.

===Climate===
Sorocaba climate is subtropical, with the coldest month being July and warmest in January and February. Precipitation is around . According to Köppen, Sorocaba can be classified as a Cwa climate, featuring a warm climate with summer rainfall and temperature in the warmest month ≥ .

The climate table below shows the monthly mean temperatures, maximum and minimum recorded, rainfall and rainy days with monthly and annual averages for the period from 1 January 1995 to January 1, 2011 for the city of Sorocaba.

===Land relief===
The terrain is classified as a wavy strands and characterized by local ridges, with an average altitude of 632 meters above the sea level. The highest altitude is 1028 meters, in the Serra de Sao Francisco. The lower altitude is 539 meters, in the valley of the Sorocaba River. Sorocaba is located on the edge of the Peripheral Depression of São Paulo state, in the Appalachian Fall Line, as defined by Professor Aziz Ab&#x27;Saber. This configuration is due to the fact Sorocaba lies at the boundary between the Atlantic Plateau, which covers the area of crystalline rocks, with higher relief and the rocks of the Parana Sedimentary Basin and gently rolling topography with lower altitudes. The Sorocaba River and its hydrographic basin are responsible for the relief dissection.

===Soil===
The soil is characterized as red-yellow podzolic type, with gravelly clay, heavy clay, Typic dark clayey; oxisol with clay loam. Lithosols also occur, which are usually developed with little depressions.

===Vegetation===
The original natural vegetation was the Atlantic Forest, with local regions in a Montana Tropical Rainforest. Predominate the savannah vegetation in various stages of secondary succession.

===Geology===
Sorocaba is located exactly on the limit between the sedimentary rocks of Parana Sedimentary Basin (Itararé Group, in glacial and deltaic palaeoenvironments of Permian-Carboniferous age) and crystalline basement (Neoproterozoic). Important granite massifs are Sorocaba Massif (calc-alkaline I-Type) and São Francisco Massif (Subalkaline, A-Type). Metamorphic low grade rocks as phyllites, metacalcareous, metarenites, are marine metassediments are included in Sao Roque Group (Neoproterozoic) with structural trend northeast-southwest. The Ipanema Hill or Araçoiaba Ridge is a prominent and isolated topographic elevation, it comprises ultrabasic-alkaline intrusion age (Mesozoic, Early Cretaceous), remnant of ancient volcano. It was the first iron mine, ironworks and metallurgy of Brazil, Ipanema. The ore was exploited from magnetite, probably associated to carbonatite body.

==Demography==
According to IBGE, 2010 Census, the population of Sorocaba was 586,311 inhabitants. There was a growth of 18.81% compared to 2000. The population density is 1,305.46 inhabitants per square kilometer. Women are the majority in Sorocaba, being 51.1% of the total population. In absolute numbers, there are 299,513 women and 286,798 men, 12,715 more women than men. There is a large predominance of urban population in Sorocaba, with only 1% of the population (5,971 residents) living in rural areas, compared with 580,340 in urban areas. Among the largest cities in Brazil (in population), Sorocaba is in 30th place. Among the largest cities in São Paulo (in population), it is ranked ninth.

<text>Nancy Sue Wilson (February 20, 1937 – December 13, 2018) was an American singer whose career spanned over five decades, from the mid-1950s until her retirement in the early 2010s. She was especially notable for her single &quot;(You Don&#x27;t Know) How Glad I Am&quot; and her version of the standard &quot;Guess Who I Saw Today&quot;. Wilson recorded more than 70 albums and won three Grammy Awards for her work. During her performing career, Wilson was labeled a singer of blues, jazz, R&amp;B, pop, and soul; a &quot;consummate actress&quot;; and &quot;the complete entertainer&quot;. The title she preferred, however, was &quot;song stylist&quot;. She received many nicknames including &quot;Sweet Nancy&quot;, &quot;The Baby&quot;, &quot;Fancy Miss Nancy&quot; and &quot;The Girl With the Honey-Coated Voice&quot;.

== Early life ==
Nancy Wilson was born on February 20, 1937, in Chillicothe, Ohio, to Olden Wilson, an iron foundry worker, and Lillian Ryan.

Wilson attended Burnside Heights Elementary School and developed her singing skills by participating in church choirs. She attended West High School in Columbus, Ohio where she won a talent contest and was rewarded with a role as a host for a local television show. She then went on to attend Ohio&#x27;s Central State University where she pursued her B.A. degree in education.

== Career ==

When Wilson met Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley, he suggested she move to New York City for career opportunities. In 1959, she moved to New York to try to hire Adderley&#x27;s manager and get a contract with Capitol Records. Within four weeks of her arrival in New York she got her first big break, a call to fill in for Irene Reid at &quot;The Blue Morocco&quot;. The club booked Wilson on a permanent basis; she was singing four nights a week and working as a secretary for the New York Institute of Technology during the day. John Levy sent demos of &quot;Guess Who I Saw Today&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;m Happy&quot;, and two other songs to Capitol. Capitol Records signed her in 1960.

Wilson&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Guess Who I Saw Today&quot;, was so successful that between April 1960 and July 1962 Capitol Records released five Nancy Wilson albums. Her first album, &quot;Like in Love,&quot; displayed her talent in Rhythm and Blues. Adderley suggested that she should steer away from her original pop style and gear her music toward jazz and ballads. In 1962, they collaborated, producing the album &quot;Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley&quot;, which propelled her to national prominence with the hit R&amp;B song, &quot;Save Your Love For Me&quot;, and Wilson would later appear on Adderley&#x27;s live album &quot;In Person&quot; (1968). Between March 1964 and June 1965, four of Wilson&#x27;s albums hit the Top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs chart. In 1963, &quot;Tell Me The Truth&quot; became her first truly major hit, leading up to her performance at the Coconut Grove in 1964 – the turning point of her career, garnering critical acclaim from coast to coast. &quot;TIME&quot; said of her, &quot;She is, all at once, both cool and sweet, both singer and storyteller.&quot; In 1964 Wilson released what became her most successful hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;(You Don&#x27;t Know) How Glad I Am&quot;, which peaked at No. 11. From 1963 to 1971 Wilson logged 11 songs on the Hot 100, including two Christmas singles. However, &quot;Face It Girl, It&#x27;s Over&quot; was the only remaining non-Christmas song to crack the Top 40 for Wilson (No. 29, in 1968).
After making numerous television guest appearances, Wilson eventually got her own series on NBC, &quot;The Nancy Wilson Show&quot; (1967–1968), which won an Emmy. Over the years she appeared on many popular television shows from &quot;I Spy&quot; (more or less playing herself as a Las Vegas singer in the 1966 episode &quot;Lori&quot;, and a similar character in the 1973 episode &quot;The Confession&quot; of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;), &quot;Room 222, Hawaii Five-O, Police Story, The Jack Paar Program, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show (1966), The Danny Kaye Show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Kraft Music Hall, The Sinbad Show,&quot; &quot;The Cosby Show, The Andy Williams Show, The Carol Burnett Show, Soul Food, New York Undercover,&quot; and recently &quot;Moesha&quot;, and &quot;The Parkers.&quot; She also appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; &quot;The Merv Griffin Show,&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; and &quot;The Flip Wilson Show.&quot; She was in the 1993 Robert Townsend&#x27;s &quot;The Meteor Man&quot; and in the film, &quot;The Big Score.&quot; She also appeared on &quot;The Lou Rawls Parade of Stars&quot; and the &quot;March of Dimes Telethon&quot;.

She was signed by Capitol Records in the late 1970s and in an attempt to broaden her appeal she cut the album &quot;Life, Love and Harmony&quot;, an album of soulful, funky dance cuts that included the track &quot;Sunshine&quot;, which was to become one of her most sought-after recordings (albeit among supporters of the rare soul scene with whom she would not usually register). In 1977 she recorded the theme song for &quot;The Last Dinosaur&quot;, a made-for-TV movie which opened in theaters in Japan.
 In the 1980s, she recorded five albums for Japanese labels because she preferred recording live, and American labels frequently did not give her that option. She gained such wide popularity that she was selected as the winner of the annual Tokyo Song Festivals.

In 1982, Wilson recorded with Hank Jones and the Great Jazz Trio. In that same year she recorded with the Griffith Park Band whose members included Chick Corea and Joe Henderson. In 1987 she participated in a PBS show entitled &quot;Newport Jazz &#x27;87&quot; as the singer of a jazz trio with John Williams and Roy McCurdy. In 1982, she also signed with CBS, her albums here including &quot;The Two of Us&quot; (1984), duets with Ramsey Lewis produced by Stanley Clarke; &quot;Forbidden Lover&quot; (1987), including the title-track duet with Carl Anderson; and &quot;A Lady with a Song&quot;, which became her 52nd album release in 1989. In 1989, &quot;Nancy Wilson in Concert&quot; played as a television special. In the early 1990s, Wilson recorded an album paying tribute to Johnny Mercer with co-producer Barry Manilow entitled &quot;With My Lover Beside Me&quot;. In this decade she also recorded two other albums, &quot;Love, Nancy&quot; and her sixtieth album &quot;If I Had My Way&quot;. In the late 1990s, she teamed up with MCG Jazz, a youth-education program of the Manchester Craftsmen&#x27;s Guild, nonprofit, minority-directed, arts and learning organization located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1995, Wilson performed at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and the San Francisco Jazz Festival in 1997. In 1999, she hosted a show in honor of Ella Fitzgerald entitled &quot;Forever Ella&quot; on the A &amp; E Network. All the proceeds from 2001&#x27;s &quot;A Nancy Wilson Christmas&quot; went to support the work of MCG Jazz. Wilson was the host on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Profiles&quot;, from 1996 to 2005. This series profiled the legends and legacy of jazz through music, interviews and commentary. Wilson and the program were the recipients of the George Foster Peabody Award in 2001. Wilson&#x27;s second and third album with MCG Jazz, &quot;R.S.V.P. (Rare Songs, Very Personal)&quot; (2005), and &quot;Turned to Blue&quot; (2007), both won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album. On September 10, 2011, she performed on a public stage for the last time at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. According to Wilson, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be doing it anymore, and what better place to end it than where I started – in Ohio.&quot;

==Awards==

In 1964, Wilson won her first Grammy Award for the best rhythm and blues recording for the album &quot;How Glad I Am&quot;. She was featured as a &quot;grand diva&quot; of jazz in a 1992 edition of &quot;Essence&quot;. In the same year, she also received the Whitney Young Jr. Award from the Urban League. In 1998, she was a recipient of the &quot;Playboy&quot; Reader Poll Award for best jazz vocalist.

In 1986, she was dubbed the Global Entertainer of the Year by the World Conference of Mayors. She received an award from the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in 1993; the NAACP Image Award – Hall of Fame Award in 1998, and was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1999. She received the Trumpet Award for Outstanding Achievement in 1994. Wilson received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990, at 6541 Hollywood Blvd. She received honorary degrees from Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA and Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio. She is also a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Wilson has a street named after her in her hometown of Chillicothe, Ohio. She co-founded the Nancy Wilson Foundation, which exposes inner-city children to the country. Wilson was the recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships award in 2004, the highest honors that the United States government bestows upon jazz musicians. In 2005 she received the NAACP Image Awards for Best Recording Jazz Artist. She received the 2005 UNCF Trumpet Award celebrating African-American achievement, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the NAACP in Chicago, and Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Legends Award.

In September 2005, Wilson was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. Wilson was a major figure in Civil Rights Movement. Wilson noted that the ceremony gave her &quot;one of the best ceremonies that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.&quot; Times.com, August 20, 2006: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long career for the polished Wilson, whose first albums appeared in the 1960s, and she faces that truth head-on in such numbers as &#x27;These Golden Years&#x27; and &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Remember Ever Growing Up&#x27;. Shorter breathed these days, she can still summon a warm, rich sound and vividly tell a song&#x27;s story. With a big band behind her in &#x27;Taking a Chance on Love&#x27;, she also shows there&#x27;s plenty of fire in her autumnal mood&quot;. At the Hollywood Bowl, August 29, 2007, Wilson celebrated her 70th birthday with an all-star event hosted by Arsenio Hall. Ramsey Lewis and his trio performed &quot;To Know Her Is To Love Her&quot;.

==Life and death==
Wilson and her first husband, drummer Kenny Dennis, were married in 1960. They had a son Kenneth (&quot;Kacy&quot;) Dennis Jr., but by 1970 they had divorced.

Wilson married Reverend Wiley Burton, a Presbyterian minister, on May 22, 1974. They married within a month of their first meeting. She gave birth to Samantha Burton in 1975, and the couple adopted Sheryl Burton in 1976.

As a result of her marriage, she abstained from performing in various venues such as supper clubs. For the following two decades, she successfully juggled her personal life and her career. Both of her parents died in November 1998; she called this year the most difficult of her life.

Wilson was hospitalized with anemia and potassium deficiency, and was on I.V. sustenance while undergoing a complete battery of tests, in August 2006. She was unable to attend the UNCF Evening of Stars Tribute to Aretha Franklin and had to cancel the engagement. All of her other engagements were on hold pending doctors&#x27; reports.

She was hospitalized for lung complications in March 2008, but recovered and was reported to be doing well. Later that year, her husband, Wiley Burton, died after suffering from renal cancer. Wilson died after a long illness at her home in Pioneertown, California on December 13, 2018. She was 81 years old.

<text>Nancy Lamoureux Wilson (born March 16, 1954) is an American musician. She rose to fame alongside her older sister Ann as guitarist and second vocalist in the rock band Heart.

Raised in Bellevue, Washington, Wilson began playing music as a teenager. During college, she joined her sister who had recently become the singer of Heart. Considered the first hard rock band fronted by women to achieve widespread commercial success, Heart released numerous albums throughout the late 1970s and 1980s; the albums &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; (1975) and &quot;Little Queen&quot; (1977) generated chart singles such as &quot;Magic Man&quot;, &quot;Crazy on You&quot;, and &quot;Barracuda&quot;. The band also had commercial success with their eighth, ninth, and tenth studio albums, &quot;Heart&quot;, &quot;Bad Animals&quot;, and &quot;Brigade&quot;, which were released in 1985, 1987, and 1990 respectively. Heart has sold over 35 million records.

Wilson has been lauded for her guitar playing, noted for its blending elements of flamenco and classical guitar styles with hard rock. In 2016, &quot;Gibson&quot; ranked Wilson the eighth-greatest female guitarist of all time. She is also an accomplished singer in her own right, being the lead vocalist in the song &quot;These Dreams&quot;, which became Heart&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2013, Wilson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Heart.

==Early life==
Nancy Lamoureux Wilson was born March 16, 1954, in San Francisco, California, the third and youngest child of John Wilson ( 2000), and Lois Mary Wilson (née Dustin; 2006). She has two older sisters, Lynn and Ann. Both of Wilson&#x27;s parents were natives of Oregonher father from Corvallis, and her mother from Oregon City. Her middle name is derived from her grandmother, Beatrice Lamoureux. Wilson is of French Canadian and Scottish descent. She was raised in Southern California and Taiwan before the family&#x27;s U.S. Marine Corps father retired to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington, where they relocated when Wilson was six years old. The family lived in a Colonial home in the Lake Hills neighborhood.

On February 9, 1964, Wilson and her sister Ann saw the Beatles perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, a moment they each recalled as being profoundly influential: &quot;The lightning bolt came out of the heavens and struck Ann and me the first time we saw the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;... There&#x27;d been so much anticipation and hype about the Beatles that it was a huge event, like the lunar landing; that was the moment Ann and I heard the call to become rock musicians. I was seven or eight at the time... right away, we started doing air guitar shows in the living room, faking English accents, and studying all the fanzines.&quot; On August 25, 1966, the Beatles performed at the Seattle Center Coliseum, a show which Wilson, her sister Ann, and bandmates attended, another event both recalled as influential in their early lives.

Ann Wilson attended Sammamish High School in Bellevue, where her father was an English teacher, while Nancy attended the newly-opened Interlake High School. After graduating in 1972 and prior to joining Heart, Wilson attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, for one year, majoring in art and German, then transferred to Portland State University. In late 1973, Wilson returned to the Seattle area and attended the University of Washington.

==Career==

=== Early endeavors ===
Two of the Wilson sisters&#x27; friends joined them to form the Wilsons&#x27; first music group, the Viewpoints. The Viewpoints were a four-part harmony vocal group. Later that year, Ann purchased her first guitar, a Kent acoustic, with money given to her by her grandmother. Wilson&#x27;s parents soon bought Nancy a smaller guitar, but since it would not stay in tune, she began playing Ann&#x27;s Kent guitar. The Viewpoints&#x27; first public show was a folk festival on Vashon Island in 1967. In Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;We didn&#x27;t get paid, but since there were people sitting in folding chairs, we considered it a professional gig.&quot; The band played at venues such as drive-ins, auto shows, and church socials.

The Wilsons&#x27; public debut as a duo took place on Mother&#x27;s Day at their church. Later at a church Youth Day event, the duo performed &quot;The Great Mandala (The Wheel of Life)&quot; by Peter, Paul and Mary, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;, and The Doors&#x27; &quot;When the Music&#x27;s Over&quot;. The anti-war sentiment, and the irreverence for the venue in some of the lyrics, offended a number of people. By the time they finished, more than half had walked out. Wilson felt some guilt over the event, but &quot;it lit a bonfire under us because we saw for the first time that what we did on stage could have an impact on an audience.&quot;

While still a senior in high school, Ann joined a band whose drummer knew a country songwriter who needed a backing band to play on his songwriting demos; Wilson and sister Ann entered a recording studio in Seattle to record the demos. During the session, the engineer allowed them to record the song &quot;Through Eyes and Glass&quot;, which Nancy and Ann had written. The engineer had his own record label, and liked their songs enough that he offered to make up 500 copies &quot;for a few bucks&quot;. Nancy and Ann&#x27;s first single appeared on the B-side of the country track titled &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Drink My Hurt Away&quot;. It was credited to Ann Wilson and the Daybreaks, which was not the name of the band, and it omitted Nancy as co-songwriter. Later, the sisters were returned 250 unsold copies of the record.

=== 1970s ===
During college, Wilson played solo acoustic shows at student unions, performing covers of Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon songs, as well as occasional originals.

Wilson&#x27;s sister Ann was an acquaintance of guitarist Roger Fisher and bass player Steve Fossen (of the local band The Army) when she answered their advertisement seeking a drummer and a singer. She impressed them with her vocal skills. Within an hour of meeting them, Ann joined the group, which was called Hocus Pocus.

The group shortly reformed as Heart. Pressed by her sister, Nancy joined the band and relocated to West Vancouver. Wilson recalls that &quot;some of the guys&quot; in the band were initially resistant to her joining, and insisted she audition by sitting in periodically. She was given the assignment to work up the introduction to the Yes song &quot;Clap&quot; (from &quot;The Yes Album&quot;). She learned it, and the next night after playing it with the band at a tavern, was officially made a member of the band.

The band had recorded a demo with Mushroom Records some time before, and producer Mike Flicker remembered them. Flicker saw Nancy as a &quot;diamond in the rough&quot;, but was intrigued by the idea of a female rock guitarist.

Mushroom Records released &quot;Magic Man&quot; as a single before Heart&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot;, had been completed. The song received airplay in and around Vancouver. Portrait Records released the band&#x27;s second official studio album, &quot;Little Queen&quot;, in May 1977. The album spawned the track &quot;Barracuda&quot;, which reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The band&#x27;s third official release, &quot;Magazine&quot;, was released pre-emptively by Mushroom the following year, and contained eight tracks, some of which had been unfinished; the band sought an injunction and &quot;Magazine&quot; was recalled after 50,000 copies had already been sold. The dispute over the record lasted nearly two years. 

Wilson and the group traveled to Berkeley, California, where her friend, Sue Ennis, was studying to receive a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. Ennis became a writing partner on the group&#x27;s fourth release, &quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot;, which they wrote together over the course of a single day. The album was released in October 1978, selling a million copies within the first month. It remained on the album charts for the better part of a year and went on to become a triple-platinum album. It was the band&#x27;s fourth million-selling album in a row.

During their tour to support &quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot;, Wilson and Fisher, who were a couple at the time, became estranged. After discovering Fisher had cheated on her, Wilson began dating Michael Derosier. This resulted in tension between the band members, ending with Fisher destroying a guitar onstage and throwing part of it at Wilson in a dressing room. In October 1979, the group voted to oust Fisher from the band; this change allowed Wilson the opportunity to play more lead guitar.

=== 1980s ===
Heart&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Bébé le Strange&quot;, was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1980. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Private Audition&quot;, was released in June 1982 and sold only 400,000 copies; it peaked at number 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. After their series of platinum and gold albums, this was considered a flop. However, Heart continued to do well with concert sales, and had the eighth-highest-grossing tour of the year. During this time, tensions between Wilson and drummer Derosier had increased after several breakups, and both bassist Fossen and he decided to leave the band. Over the next year, they were replaced by bassist Mark Andes and drummer Denny Carmassi.

The lackluster performance of &quot;Private Audition&quot; led to increased pressure for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Passionworks&quot; (1983). Drugs became a factor in the band&#x27;s work during this time. Wilson recalls: &quot;Everything we did in those years had a white sheen of powder over it. There were only a few people on our crew, or band, who resisted. Cocaine was sprinkled over the albums, the videos, and our lives. Cocaine stripped all the humor out of our music. The videos we made were completely without intentional comedy, but were so serious they had an almost comedic feel.&quot; After the release of &quot;Passionworks&quot;, CBS dropped the band due to lackluster sales.

The self-titled &quot;Heart&quot; (1985) became the band&#x27;s first number-one album. &quot;What About Love&quot; was released as a single ahead of the album; it became a hit, and crossed over into the pop charts. The album remained on the charts for 78 weeks and went on to be certified five-times platinum. The album had five hit singles, including &quot;These Dreams&quot;, a single that featured Nancy Wilson on lead vocals. &quot;These Dreams&quot; had been submitted to the band after Stevie Nicks had turned it down. Though she had not written it, Wilson loved the song from the start. She had to fight to sing it because some band members thought it &quot;did not sound like a Heart song.&quot; During the taping session, they received a letter from Sharon Hess, a 22-year-old fan who was dying of leukemia. One of her wishes was to meet Nancy and Ann, and she arrived the same day as the recording of Nancy&#x27;s vocals for &quot;These Dreams&quot;. Sharon loved the song and Wilson dedicated it to her in the album notes. Sharon died just a few days after the final mixes were finished. &quot;These Dreams&quot; became Heart&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 22, 1986.

The album &quot;Bad Animals&quot; (1987) was preceded by the single &quot;Alone&quot;; it became the band&#x27;s second number-one hit, and the second-biggest single for the year. This gave them something they had not had with the &quot;Heart&quot; album: a number-one single before the tour started or the album was released. &quot;We were following on success, not building to it,&quot; Wilson recalled. The Bad Animals tour was to start in May 1987 in Europe, and all the dates were sellouts, including three dates at Wembley Arena. During the tour, Ann began to have moments of panic and stage fright. Nancy would have to step forward and play an unscheduled guitar solo, or other ploys, to buy time for Ann to compose herself. Work began on the following album, &quot;Brigade&quot;, in 1989.

=== 1990s ===

Around 1990, Wilson and sister Ann were approached to play a Red Cross benefit for the troops during the Gulf War. The promoter wanted Heart to play, but most of the band had been let go after the Brigade tour. Nancy and Ann coaxed Sue Ennis to join and play for the one-time event, along with another friend, Frank Cox. The band&#x27;s name, Lovemongers, emerged as a counter to war-mongering sentiment surrounding the Gulf War. Since the band lacked a drummer, Ennis programmed a rhythm track into her keyboard and they brought a cardboard cutout of Ringo Starr on stage as a joke. The group played a wrap party for &quot;Singles&quot; (1992)--a film directed by Wilson&#x27;s husband, Cameron Crowe—with a local Seattle band called Mookie Blaylock (the band was later renamed Pearl Jam). A four-song EP, which included a live version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; and an updated version of the Heart standard &quot;Crazy On You&quot;, came out in late 1992. A cover of &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; also appeared on the for the 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;.

In October 1991, Heart released &quot;Rock the House Live!&quot;, which chronicled songs played on the &quot;Brigade&quot; tour in 1990. Grunge had taken a firm hold on music by this time, and combined with the lack of big hits the album peaked at only 107 on the Billboard charts.

The album &quot;Desire Walks On&quot; was released in November 1993 and peaked on &quot;Billboard&quot; at No. 48. It was far from a flop – it received gold certification in August 1995 – but also far from the multiplatinum status their string of 1980s albums had been.

Heart owed Capitol records one more album. Since their Lovemongers shows had received such a positive response, they decided to record an &quot;unplugged&quot; album. They recruited many rock notables to contribute to the record, titled &quot;The Road Home&quot;. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin served as producer; Layne Staley of Alice in Chains and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden both contributed. The album only reached No. 87 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the group was dropped by Capitol.

In 1995, Wilson requested that Heart go on hiatus. Wilson explained that she wanted to spend more time working with husband Cameron Crowe on film scores and start a family. At the time, Wilson was 41 and undergoing fertility treatments, which were difficult to schedule around a rock tour and appearances.

Wilson had played &quot;Beautiful Girl in Car&quot; in Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, then had a small speaking part in &quot;The Wild Life&quot;. She also contributed some guitar recordings for Crowe&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Say Anything...&quot; and the original song &quot;All For Love&quot;. Wilson became more involved in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, Crowe&#x27;s new film, and decided that she would write the film score.

During her hiatus from Heart, Wilson was not entirely dormant as a performer; she played the occasional Lovemongers benefit, though she noted that her fertility treatments made performing increasingly difficult. In 1996, Wilson performed her first solo acoustic show in 30 years. Kelly Curtis arranged to have a recording of that show released as an album, &quot;Live from McCabe&#x27;s Guitar Shop&quot;, in 1999. The music on the album is a mix of Heart songs, covers (including songs by Peter Gabriel, Joni Mitchell, and Paul Simon), and original new material. In November 1997, Nancy and Ann set out on a 12-date tour traveling by van on what they called the &quot;Don&#x27;t Blink&quot; tour (joking that, &quot;if you blinked, you missed it.&quot;)

The Lovemongers released a full-length album titled &quot;Whirlygig&quot; in 1997 and a collection of mostly self-penned Christmas songs titled &quot;Here is Christmas&quot; in 1998. &quot;Here is Christmas&quot; was re-released as a Heart album with the title &quot;Heart Presents a Lovemongers&#x27; Christmas&quot; in 2001.

For Crowe&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, Wilson composed the theme and produced two original songs: &quot;Fever Dog&quot; and &quot;Lucky Trumble&quot;. She also helped as a technical consultant, coaching the actors on how to look and act like musicians on stage. Wilson was nominated for a Sierra Award for Best Score, a PFCS Award for Best Original Score, and an Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music.

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, Heart embarked on a tour. The tour became a family affair, with four children and their nannies added to the mix of musicians, technical staff, and roadies. It was an eight-week tour and ended what had been a 10-year hiatus from touring for Wilson. The Summer of Love tour concluded in Seattle and that performance was released as the &quot;Alive in Seattle&quot; DVD, which achieved gold status without an associated album.

Wilson provided the score for the films &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) and &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005). She was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for her work in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; as well as a Critics Choice Award for Best Composer for &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;.

The sisters decided to record a new Heart studio album, &quot;Jupiters Darling&quot;, the first since 1993. Wilson was co-producer, along with guitarist Craig Bartock, who had just joined the band. They wrote all the songs for the album except one. To enhance the guitar parts, Wilson got friends Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready to contribute. The album, released by Sovereign Records, charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, but sold only 100,000 copies.

In 2009, Wilson released &quot;Baby Guitars&quot;, a solo album aimed at children, composed of instrumental lullabies written and recorded with Craig Bartock. On that same year, after completing a tour with Journey and Cheap Trick, Wilson began recording Heart&#x27;s 14th studio album, &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot;, with Ann. The album was released in 2010 and included two singles by Nancy: &quot;Hey You&quot;, which reached the top 40 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart; and &quot;Sunflower&quot;, which Nancy wrote for Ann&#x27;s 60th birthday. The album peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and three on the Rock Albums chart. With Nancy now aged 56, and Ann about to become a grandmother, the sisters had managed to have albums make it onto top-10 charts in four different decades. The band&#x27;s subsequent tour sold out and charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; just behind those of Lady Gaga and Rihanna.

=== 2010s ===

After completing an international tour with Def Leppard in 2011, Heart was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On December 11, 2012, Heart was announced to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2013, along with Rush, Albert King, Randy Newman, Donna Summer, Public Enemy, Quincy Jones, and Lou Adler. Nancy and Ann also received a star for Heart on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September 2012.

Heart released its 15th studio album, &quot;Fanatic&quot;, in October 2012; it debuted at number 24 on the &quot; Billboard&quot; 200, and hit number 10 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Rock Album chart.

Simultaneously, Wilson began assisting in compiling the band&#x27;s first boxed set, &quot;Strange Euphoria&quot; (taken from the name of their music publishing company).

In 2016, Heart released their 16th studio album, titled &quot;Beautiful Broken&quot;, which features Wilson singing lead vocals on the tracks &quot;Two&quot; and &quot;One Word&quot;. At an August 26, 2016, show in Auburn, Washington, Wilson&#x27;s teenaged sons were reportedly assaulted by Ann&#x27;s husband, Dean Wetter. After the incident, Ann confirmed that Heart was on an &quot;indefinite&quot; hiatus.

In late 2016, Wilson formed a band called Roadcase Royale with former Prince band member and R&amp;B singer Liv Warfield, lead guitarist Ryan Waters (the musical director for Liv&#x27;s solo work and Prince protégé), Heart keyboardist Chris Joyner, bassist Dan Rothchild, and drummer Ben Smith. They released their first single, &quot;Get Loud&quot;, in January 2017. The band signed with Loud and Proud Records in July 2017 and released their debut full-length album &quot;First Things First&quot; on September 22, 2017.

In February 2019, Heart announced that its hiatus had ended and that the band would embark on the Love Alive tour in the summer of 2019.

===2020s===
In 2021, she released her first solo studio rock album, &quot;You and Me&quot;. In 2022, she started touring under the name Nancy Wilson&#x27;s Heart, which includes singer Kimberly Nichole, who was a finalist on Season 8 of &quot;The Voice&quot;, and former Heart members Ryan Waters (guitars), Ben Smith (drums), Andy Stoller (bass) and Dan Walker (keyboards).

==Personal life==
Wilson dated bandmates Roger Fisher and Michael Derosier during the early years of Heart. In 1981, Wilson&#x27;s friend Kelly Curtis introduced her to screenwriter Cameron Crowe; Wilson married him on July 27, 1986. After numerous failed fertility treatments, Wilson and Crowe conceived via an egg donor and surrogate, and the surrogate gave birth to twin sons, Curtis Wilson and William &quot;Billy&quot; James Crowe, in January 2000. The marriage ended in divorce in 2010, with the couple citing irreconcilable differences.

In 2011, Wilson began dating Geoff Bywater, who worked in music production on television shows for Fox. They were engaged in 2012 and married on April 28, 2012, in Mill Valley, California.

On the morning of August 27, 2016, Ann Wilson&#x27;s husband, Dean Wetter, was arrested for physically assaulting Nancy Wilson&#x27;s 16-year-old twin sons. The incident took place during a Heart performance at the White River Amphitheater in Auburn, Washington, the previous night. The sisters&#x27; relationship was strained by the incident. Wetter pleaded guilty to two non-felony assault charges in the fourth degree. Nancy Wilson later commented: &quot;I&#x27;m an eternal optimist because I&#x27;m from a really strong, tight family, and I don&#x27;t think any drama that&#x27;s temporary is going to change our strong relationship. We just have to get through this first. It&#x27;s been kind of a nightmare.&quot; In February 2019, Heart announced that its hiatus had ended and that the band would embark on the Love Alive tour that summer.

<text>Douaumont () is a former commune in the Meuse department in Grand Est in north-eastern France. On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune Douaumont-Vaux.

==History==

The village was a single street lying on an east-west axis and appears to have been connected to a local industry. The population was 288 in 1911.

The village was totally destroyed during World War I. Today the Douaumont Ossuary, which contains the remains of more than 100,000 unknown soldiers of both French and German nationalities found on the battlefield, stands high above the landscape.

==Douaumont Fort==

The fort was built south-east of the village.

The construction work for Fort de Douaumont started in 1885 and the fort was continually reinforced until 1913. The fort is situated on some of the highest ground in the area.
At the very beginning of the Battle of Verdun (February 1916) and due to French unpreparedness, the fort was easily captured by a small German raiding party. Douaumont was later recaptured by the French Army in October 1916, after major casualties on both sides.

<doc id="618549" wikidata="Q17097835" url="?curid=618549" title="Coset enumeration">
<text>In mathematics, coset enumeration is the problem of counting the cosets of a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot; given in terms of a presentation. As a by-product, one obtains a permutation representation for &quot;G&quot; on the cosets of &quot;H&quot;. If &quot;H&quot; has a known finite order, coset enumeration gives the order of &quot;G&quot; as well.

For small groups it is sometimes possible to perform a coset enumeration by hand. However, for large groups it is time-consuming and error-prone, so it is usually carried out by computer. Coset enumeration is usually considered to be one of the fundamental problems in computational group theory.

The original algorithm for coset enumeration was invented by John Arthur Todd and H. S. M. Coxeter. Various improvements to the original Todd–Coxeter algorithm have been suggested, notably the classical strategies of V. Felsch and HLT (Haselgrove, Leech and Trotter). A practical implementation of these strategies with refinements is available at the ACE website. The Knuth–Bendix algorithm also can perform coset enumeration, and unlike the Todd–Coxeter algorithm, it can sometimes solve the word problem for infinite groups.

The main practical difficulties in producing a coset enumerator are that it is difficult or impossible to predict how much memory or time will be needed to complete the process. If a group is finite, then its coset enumeration must terminate eventually, although it may take arbitrarily long and use an arbitrary amount of memory, even if the group is trivial. Depending on the algorithm used, it may happen that making small changes to the presentation that do not change the group nevertheless have a large impact on the amount of time or memory needed to complete the enumeration. These behaviours are a consequence of the unsolvability of the word problem for groups.

A gentle introduction to coset enumeration is given in Rotman&#x27;s text on group theory. More detailed information on correctness, efficiency, and practical implementation can be found in the books by Sims and Holt et al.

<text>Heathkit is the brand name of kits and other electronic products produced and marketed by the Heath Company. The products over the decades have included electronic test equipment, high fidelity home audio equipment, television receivers, amateur radio equipment, robots, electronic ignition conversion modules for early model cars with point style ignitions, and the influential Heath H-8, H-89, and H-11 hobbyist computers, which were sold in kit form for assembly by the purchaser.

Heathkit manufactured electronic kits from 1947 until 1992. After closing that business, the Heath Company continued with its products for education, and motion-sensor lighting controls. The lighting control business was sold around 2000. The company announced in 2011 that they were reentering the kit business after a 20-year hiatus but then filed for bankruptcy in 2012, and under new ownership began restructuring in 2013. , the company has a live website with newly designed products, services, vintage kits, and replacement parts for sale. In August 2023 Heath Company announced its acquisition by Kirkwall (company) as part of a planned expansion in North Dakota, and named former CIA officer and entrepreneur Will Cromarty as President and Chief Executive Officer.

== Founding ==
The Heath Company was founded as an aircraft company in 1911 by Edward Bayard Heath with the purchase of Bates Aeroplane Co, soon renamed to E.B. Heath Aerial Vehicle Co. Starting in 1926 it sold a light aircraft, the Heath Parasol, in kit form. Heath died during a 1931 test flight. The company reorganized and moved from Chicago to Niles, Michigan.

In 1935, Howard Anthony purchased the then-bankrupt Heath Company, and focused on selling accessories for small aircraft. After World War II, Anthony decided that entering the electronics industry was a good idea, and bought a large stock of surplus wartime electronic parts with the intention of building kits with them. In 1947, Heath introduced its first electronic kit, the O1 oscilloscope with 5-inch diameter cathode-ray tube (CRT) display that sold for US$39.50 () – the price was unbeatable at the time, and the oscilloscope went on to be a huge seller.

== Heathkit product concept ==

After the success of the oscilloscope kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchasers could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a significantly lower cash cost and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it themselves. During those decades, the premise was basically valid.

Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as vacuum tubes, tube sockets, capacitors, inductors, and resistors, mostly hand-wired and assembled using point-to-point construction technology. The home kit-builder could perform these labor-intensive assembly tasks himself, and if careful, attain at least the same standard of quality. In the case of Heathkit&#x27;s most expensive product at the time, the Thomas electronic organ, building the kit version represented substantial savings.

One category in which Heathkit enjoyed great popularity was amateur radio. Ham radio operators had frequently been forced to build their equipment from scratch before the advent of kits, with the difficulty of procuring all the parts separately and relying on often-experimental designs. Kits brought the convenience of all parts being supplied together, with the assurance of a predictable finished product; many Heathkit model numbers became well known in the ham radio community. The HW-101 HF transceiver became so ubiquitous that even today the &quot;Hot Water One-Oh-One&quot; can be found in use, or purchased as used equipment at hamfests, decades after it went out of production.

In the case of electronic test equipment, Heathkits often filled a low-end entry-level niche, giving hobbyists access at an affordable price.

The instruction books were regarded as among the best in the kit industry, being models of clarity, beginning with basic lessons on soldering technique, and proceeding with explicit step-by-step directions, illustrated with numerous line drawings; the drawings could be folded out to be visible next to the relevant text (which might be bound several pages away) and were aligned with the assembler&#x27;s viewpoint. Also in view was a checkbox to mark with a pencil as each task was accomplished. The instructions usually included complete schematic diagrams, block diagrams depicting different subsystems and their interconnections, and a &quot;Theory of Operation&quot; section that explained the basic function of each section of the electronics.

==Heathkits as education==

No knowledge of electronics was needed to assemble a Heathkit. The assembly process itself did not teach much about electronics, but provided a great deal of what could have been called basic &quot;electronics literacy&quot;, such as the ability to identify tube pin numbers or to read a resistor color code. Many hobbyists began by assembling Heathkits, became familiar with the appearance of components like capacitors, transformers, resistors, and tubes, and were motivated to understand just what these components actually did. For those builders who had a deeper knowledge of electronics (or for those who wanted to be able to troubleshoot/repair the product in the future), the assembly manuals usually included a detailed &quot;Theory of Operation&quot; chapter, which explained the functioning of the kit&#x27;s circuitry, section by section.

Heath developed a business relationship with electronics correspondence schools (e.g., NRI and Bell &amp; Howell), and supplied electronic kits to be assembled as part of their courses, with the schools basing their texts and lessons around the kits. In the 1960s, Heathkit marketed a line of its electronic instruments which had been modified for use in teaching physics at the high school (Physical Science Study Committee, PSSC) and college levels (Berkeley Physics Course).

Heathkits could teach deeper lessons. &quot;The kits taught Steve Jobs that products were manifestations of human ingenuity, not magical objects dropped from the sky&quot;, writes a business author, who goes on to quote Jobs as saying &quot;It gave a tremendous level of self-confidence, that through exploration and learning one could understand seemingly very complex things in one&#x27;s environment.&quot;

== Diversification ==
After the death of Howard Anthony in a 1954 airplane crash, his widow sold the company to Daystrom Company, a management holding company that also owned several other electronics companies. Daystrom was absorbed by oilfield service company Schlumberger Limited in 1962, and the Daystrom/Schlumberger days were to be among Heathkit&#x27;s most successful.

Those years saw some &quot;firsts&quot; in the general consumer market. The early 1960s saw the introduction of the AA-100 integrated amplifier. The early 1970s saw Heath introduce the AJ-1510, an FM tuner using digital synthesis, the GC-1005 digital clock, and the GR-2000 color television set. In 1974, Heathkit started &quot;Heathkit Educational Systems&quot;, which expanded their manuals into general electronics and computer training materials. Heathkit also expanded their expertise into digital and, eventually, computerized equipment, producing among other things digital clocks and weather stations with the new technology.

Kits were compiled in small batches mostly by hand, using roller conveyor lines. These lines were put up and taken down as needed. Some kits were sold completely &quot;assembled and tested&quot; in the factory. These models were differentiated with a &quot;W&quot; suffix after the model number, indicating that they were factory-wired.

For much of Heathkit&#x27;s history, there were competitors. In electronic kits: Allied Radio, an electronic parts supply house, had its KnightKits, Lafayette Radio offered some kits, Radio Shack made a few forays into this market with its Archerkit line, Dynaco made its audio products available in kit form (Dynakits), as did H. H. Scott, Inc., Fisher, and Eico; and later such companies as Southwest Technical Products and the David Hafler Company.

== Personal computers ==

Before entering the burgeoning home computer market, Heathkit marketed and sold microprocessor-based systems aimed at learning about this technology. The ET-3400, for example, was released in 1976 and was based on the Motorola 6800 microprocessor. This system included 256 bytes of RAM, a 1k monitor in ROM, and a keypad for easy entry and modification of programs. Despite being a small trainer kit, it was powerful and flexible enough to be used in rudimentary control systems.

In 1977, Heathkit introduced the Heathkit H8 home computer. The H8 was very successful, as were the H19 and H29 terminals, and the H89 &quot;All in One&quot; computer. The H8 and H89 ran the Heathkit custom operating system HDOS as well as the popular CP/M operating system. The H89 contained two Zilog Z80 8-bit processors, one for the computer and one for the built-in H-19 terminal. The H11, a low-end DEC LSI-11 16-bit computer, was less successful, probably because it was substantially more expensive than the 8-bit computer line.

Seeing the potential in personal computers, Zenith Radio Company bought Heath Company from Schlumberger in 1979 for $63 million, renaming the computer division Zenith Data Systems (ZDS). Zenith purchased Heath for the flexible assembly line infrastructure at the nearby St. Joseph facility as well as the R&amp;D assets.

Heath/Zenith was in the vanguard of companies to start selling personal computers to small businesses. The WH-89 assembled version of the H-89 kit was re-branded as the Zenith Z-89/Z-90, an assembled all in one system with a monitor and a floppy disk drive. They had agreements with Peachtree Software to sell a customized &quot;turn-key&quot; version of their accounting, CPA, and real estate management software. Shortly after the release of the Z-90, they released a 10MB hard disk unit and double-density external floppy disk drives.

While the H11 was popular with hard-core hobbyists, Heath engineers realized that DEC&#x27;s low-end PDP-11 microprocessors would not be able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems at an affordable price. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088-based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in assembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 225 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, the competing operating systems could read each other&#x27;s disks.

In 1982 Heath introduced the Hero-1 robot kit to teach principles of industrial robotics. The robot included a Motorola 6808 processor, ultrasonic sensor, and optionally a manipulator arm; the complete robot could be purchased assembled for $2495 or a basic kit without the arm purchased for $999. This was the first in a popular series of Heathkit robot kits sold to educational and hobbyist users.

== Kit era comes to a close ==
While Heath/Zenith&#x27;s computer business was successful, the growing popularity of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. Also, while their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products; &quot;BYTE&quot; reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to surface mount components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products.

As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.

In March 1992, Heath announced that it was discontinuing electronic kits after 45 years. The company had been the last sizable survivor of a dozen kit manufacturers from the 1960s. In 1995, Bull sold Heathkit to a private investor group called HIG, which then sold it to another investment group in 1998. Wanting to only concentrate on the educational products, this group sold the Heath/Zenith name and products to DESA International, a maker of specialty tools and heaters. In late 2008, Heathkit Educational Systems sold a large portion of its physical collection of legacy kit schematics and manuals along with permission to make reproductions to Don Peterson, though it still retained the copyrights and trademarks, and had pointers to people that could help with the older equipment.

DESA filed bankruptcy in December 2008. The Heathkit company existed for a few years as Heathkit Educational Systems located in Saint Joseph, Michigan, concentrating on the educational market. The Heathkit company filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

==Revival==
In May 2013, Heathkit&#x27;s corporate restructuring was announced on their website. An extensive FAQ accessible from their homepage stated clearly that Heathkit was back, and that they would resume electronic kit production and sales.

On October 8, 2015, Heathkit circulated an email to its &quot;insiders&quot;, who had indicated an interest in the company&#x27;s progress by completing its online marketing survey. It had now secured the rights to all Heathkit designs and trademarks; secured several new patents; established new offices, warehouse space, and a factory in Santa Cruz, California; and had introduced the renewed company&#x27;s first new electronic kit in decades. Since then, Heathkit has announced and sold further kits in its new lineup of products. In addition, limited repair service on vintage products, reprints of manuals and schematics, remaining inventories of original parts, and upgrades of some vintage models are available.

== Amateur radio ==

Heathkit made amateur radio kits almost from the beginning. In addition to their low prices compared with commercially manufactured equipment, Heathkits appealed to amateurs who had an interest in building their own equipment, but did not necessarily have the expertise or desire to design it and obtain all the parts themselves. They expanded and enhanced their line of amateur radio gear through nearly four decades. By the late 1960s, Heathkit had as large a selection of ham equipment as any company in the field.

<text>Arnold Gehlen (29 January 1904 in Leipzig, German Empire – 30 January 1976 in Hamburg, West Germany) was an influential conservative German philosopher, sociologist, and anthropologist.

== Biography ==
Gehlen&#x27;s major influences while studying philosophy were Hans Driesch, Nicolai Hartmann and especially Max Scheler.
Furthermore, he was heavily influenced by Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer and US-American pragmatism: Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and especially George Herbert Mead.

In 1933 Gehlen signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. Although he joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and made a career as a member of the &#x27;Leipzig School&#x27; under Hans Freyer, he was a political opportunist: his main work &quot;Der Mensch&quot; appeared in 1940 and was published in English translation in 1987 as &quot;Man. His Nature and Place in the World&quot;. Gehlen was a modernist conservative who accepted the cultural changes brought about by the industrial revolution and by mass society (see his &quot;Man in the age of technology&quot;, Chapter V).

Gehlen succeeded Paul Tillich, who emigrated to the U.S., at the University of Frankfurt. In 1938 he accepted a teaching position at the University of Königsberg (today&#x27;s Kaliningrad) and then taught at the University of Vienna in 1940 until he was drafted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in 1943. After undergoing denazification he taught at the administrative college in Speyer. He went on to teach at the Aachen University of Technology between 1962 and 1969. Gehlen became a sharp critic of the protest movements that developed in the late 1960s.

He was the cousin of Reinhard Gehlen, the founder and president of the West German Federal Intelligence Service.

== Main ideas ==

Gehlen&#x27;s core idea in &quot;Der Mensch&quot; is that humans have unique properties which distinguish them from all other species: world-openness (:de:Weltoffenheit), a concept originally coined by Max Scheler, which describes the ability of humans to adapt to various environments as contrasted with animals, which can only survive in environments which match their evolutionary specialisation. This world-openness gives us the ability to shape our environment according to our intentions, and it comprises a view of language as a way of acting (Gehlen was one of the first proponents of speech act theory), an excess of impulses and the ability of self-control. These properties allow us—in contrast to all other animals—to create our own (for example cultural) environments, though this is also at the risk of a certain self-destabilisation.
Gehlen&#x27;s philosophy has influenced many contemporary German thinkers in a range of disciplines, including Peter L. Berger, Thomas Luckmann and Niklas Luhmann in sociology, and Hans Blumenberg in philosophy. Since the mid-2010s, there has occurred a Gehlen revival based in part on the predictions in his book &quot;Moral und Hypermoral&quot; as concerns the development of German (and Western) politics from 1969. Two examples of his work - &quot;On culture, nature and naturalness&quot; and &quot;Man and Institutions&quot; - are included in the anthology of conservative social and political thought published by Jerry Z. Muller in 1997.

=== &quot;Post-histoire&quot; ===
As early as 1952 Gehlen adopted the expression &quot;post-histoire&quot; from the writings of Paul de Man&#x27;s uncle, Hendrik de Man, a Belgian socialist thinker who later became a Nazi collaborator. He first used the term to designate an epoch characterized by a state of stability and rigidity, devoid of utopian ideas, change, or development. In 1961, in an article appropriately entitled &quot;Über kulturelle Kristallisation&quot; ( &quot;On Cultural Crystallization&quot;), Gehlen wrote: &quot;I am predicting that the history of ideas has come to an end and that we have arrived at the epoch of &quot;post-histoire&quot;, so that now the advice Gottfried Benn gave the individual, &#x27;Make do with what you have,&#x27; is valid for humanity as a whole&quot;.

<doc id="618559" wikidata="Q1457450" url="?curid=618559" title="Grandia II">
<text>is a role-playing video game developed by Game Arts originally for the Dreamcast console as part of their &quot;Grandia&quot; series. Initially released in Japan by Game Arts in August 2000, the game was published by Ubi Soft in North America in December 2000 and in Europe in February 2001. &quot;Grandia II&quot; was later ported to PlayStation 2, where it was released worldwide throughout 2002, and for Windows exclusively in North America and Europe later that year.

An enhanced port, based on the Dreamcast version and titled &quot;Grandia II Anniversary Edition&quot;, was released by GungHo Online Entertainment for Steam and GOG.com in August 2015. A high-definition remaster of the game and the original &quot;Grandia&quot; was released for Nintendo Switch in August 2019; an associated update for the &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; was released in October 2019. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released in March 2024.

The game was developed by many of the same staff members who worked on the original &quot;Grandia&quot;, including music composer Noriyuki Iwadare. However, it was designed around creating a more &quot;mature&quot; product than the previous title and the first in the series to feature fully three-dimensional graphics.

The game is set in a fantasy world thousands of years after a battle between Granas, the god of light, and Valmar, the god of darkness, nearly destroyed the planet until Valmar was split into pieces and scattered across the land. In the aftermath of the battle, the Church of Granas has led humanity to prosperity by spreading the word of good. However, when a young mercenary named Ryudo is charged to protect a songstress from the church named Elena, their journey reveals that the church&#x27;s history, as well as the history of the world, is not all it seems.

While the original Dreamcast version of the game received a largely positive response from critics in Japan and the West, its later ports to the PlayStation 2 and PC were typically seen as inferior due to a combination of technical shortcomings and other high-profile games released during the transition.

== Gameplay ==
The turn-based battle system is based around the IP gauge. Character icons move from left to right on the gauge. Upon reaching the beginning of the action phase on the gauge, characters select an action. That action is executed when their icon reaches the end of the action phase. The system supports limited movement during a battle; an invisible barrier prevents characters from wandering outside the arena.

Characters can run from one place to another, strike opponents, and then retreat. Selecting &quot;critical&quot; makes a character or enemy strike an opponent simultaneously. If the critical lands during the opponent&#x27;s action phase, it will &quot;cancel&quot; the opponent&#x27;s move and push the opponent&#x27;s icon substantially backward along the IP gauge, delaying the opponent from taking action. Selecting &quot;combo&quot; makes a character land two hits on an enemy. The hits can be increased with certain accessories, up to four hits per combo. A combo can also &quot;counter&quot; if it hits an enemy in an attack pose, dealing additional damage. Suppose the combo kills the intended target before reaching the final blow. In that case, the character will attack the closest enemy to complete the combo.

Characters can use magic from equipped Mana Eggs. Using magic consumes MP. More powerful magic takes longer to cast. Special moves and spells can be learned with Skills Coins and Magic Coins and have a maximum level of 5. Spell efficiency is increased and casting time decreases as the level increases. Spells can be cast instantly if a character has skills equipped, giving a +100% bonus to the element of that particular spell. Special move sets are learned from Skill Books, then equipped onto characters. Skills can boost stats or add additional effects, such as increased item drops or a canceling effect to certain spells.

== Plot ==
Ryudo is a mercenary known as a Geohound, accompanied by his talking bird companion, Skye. The Church of Granas hires him to escort Elena, a Songstress of Granas, to Garmia Tower for a ceremony. Upon arrival, he is asked to wait while they perform the ritual. However, he hears a scream and rushes up to the top floor. Seeing everyone dead and Elena with a pair of wings, he rescues her, and both return to Carbo Village. There, Ryudo is asked by the priest to escort Elena to St. Heim Papal State to seek Pope Zera&#x27;s help to cleanse Elena of the Wings of Valmar, one of several pieces of Valmar, which now possesses her.

Before he can turn the job down, the village is attacked by a mysterious winged woman, who engages and defeats Ryudo in battle. She introduces herself as Millenia and disappears. Ryudo accepts the job and departs for St. Heim with Elena. In the town of Agear, Millenia appears again, this time more friendly, and teams up with Ryudo. She accidentally reveals herself as the Wings of Valmar and that she possesses Elena, sharing her body as a separate being. After Roan and the Beast Man, Mareg, join the group, they find more pieces of Valmar, which Millenia absorbs after they are defeated.

When the group arrives at St. Heim Papal State, Elena meets with Pope Zera, who wishes to speak with Ryudo. The Pope requests that he find the legendary Granasaber, a weapon wielded by Granas that was used to defeat Valmar. Ryudo reluctantly agrees, and the group travels to Roan&#x27;s hometown of Cyrum. Upon arrival, they rest at the inn as Roan departs. The following day, it is revealed that Roan is the prince and that the people of Cyrum once assisted Valmar against Granas in the ancient war. The party enters the castle, finds the Gate of Darkness open, and discovers an ancient factory underneath the castle. They encounter the Claws of Valmar and, later, Melfice back in the castle. Melfice is Ryudo&#x27;s brother and the man Mareg seeks, who flees after defeating the group in battle, telling Ryudo to face him at home. Roan is crowned king and chooses to stay in Cyrum to encourage its people that the past does not predict their future. After being rescued, Tio, the being possessed by the Claws and an Automata, joins the group.

The party arrives by boat in the village of Garlan, Ryudo&#x27;s hometown. Ryudo is immediately chastised for returning and commanded to leave. He reveals that Melfice has returned, and he plans to kill him to end his torment of the world. At the inn, a disguised Skye reveals Ryudo&#x27;s history to Elena. Garlan used to be a village of swordsmen, with Melfice being the best. However, one night, during a storm, the idol in the hills grew restless, so the villagers sent Reena, Melfice&#x27;s fiancé, to pray at the altar. She didn&#x27;t return, and Melfice investigated, being secretly followed by Ryudo. In the shrine, Ryudo witnessed Melfice murder Reena. Ryudo later fled from town and stayed away for three years, causing the villagers to believe he abandoned them, hence their contempt. In the morning, the group travels up the mountain to confront Melfice.

At its peak, they defeat Melfice, who afterward reconciles with Ryudo and informs the group of the Granasaber&#x27;s location before dying. While Ryudo grieves, the Horns possess him, causing him to lose consciousness. At the inn, Elena asks Millenia for help, but she initially refuses. However, she relents and uses her powers to seal the Horns inside of Ryudo, who then awakens with a renewed sense of purpose. But Elena questions Granas, as it was Valmar who saved Ryudo.

The group travels to Nannan, Mareg&#x27;s hometown, near the location of the Granasaber. The group is then informed of the Granasaber&#x27;s whereabouts: within a giant cyclone to the east. The group travels there and deactivates the artificial storm, revealing the Granasaber. However, Selene, the High Priestess, appears and sacrifices a Cathedral Knight to revive the Body of Valmar around the Granasaber; the group enters the body and destroys it. Tio reveals the Granasaber as a ship, teleporting the group inside and guiding the giant sword back to St. Heim.

The &quot;Day of Darkness&quot; arrives, and the group witnesses the Cathedral Knights slaughtering the townsfolk. They fight their way to the cathedral, where Elena reveals her true mission: to absorb the pieces of Valmar so the Granasaber can destroy them. Selene reappears and transforms into the Heart of Valmar, but the group destroys it. They catch up to Zera, who reveals that Valmar was victorious in the battle against Granas, who was killed. He actually plans to use the absorbed pieces within Elena to bring Valmar back to life, and abducts her to the Moon of Valmar.

The group uses the Granasaber to reach the moon and save Elena. A wounded Mareg later sacrifices himself to allow the group to escape from the moon. Crashing near Cyrum, now besieged by monsters from the moon, the group rejoins with Roan and defends the town. Soon, Valmar&#x27;s Moon crashes into the Granas Cathedral, and the new Valmar emerges. Unfortunately, the group finds itself without the means to defeat him. Roan suggests traveling to the nearby Birthplace of the Gods for answers, which reveals much about the ancient war and the origins of both gods.

Meeting another Automata named Elmo, Ryudo chooses to confront the Horns within and is beset by many trials. However, he overcomes his fears and insecurities and is granted the true Granasaber. The party challenges Valmar and enters his body. Inside, they are confronted by Zera, who attacks them before sending a false Millenia after them. Ryudo&#x27;s party is victorious, and the true Millenia, now separated from Elena, joins them. Zera divides the group and launches a final attack against Ryudo, Elena, and Millenia. They defeat him and destroy Valmar for good, restoring peace to the world.

The ending shows the different characters one year after Valmar&#x27;s defeat. Roan is still king and embarks on a journey to find his friends. Tio has become a nurse in Cyrum, Millenia is a teacher, and Elena tours the world as a singer in a troupe. In the last scene, Ryudo says goodbye to Granasaber and buries it under a tree in a remote area. He concludes that humanity will care for themselves and no longer depend on gods to continue living.

== Ports ==
&quot;Grandia II&quot; was ported to PlayStation 2 and PC after its initial release on Dreamcast. In the PlayStation 2 version, some textures and characters are less graphically detailed than in the Dreamcast version. Also, there is a tendency for graphical glitches and slow down to occur in areas with heavy graphic data. For instance, when a party member defeats the last enemy standing while using the weapon or accessory Warp effect, the character&#x27;s color scheme vanishes, and only a bright white model is left.

On the PC port, there is a glitch in the first fight with Millenia. Several video files on the disc contain extra frames appearing as a freeze after casting specific spells.

On May 11, 2015, GungHo America president Jun Iwasaki revealed to GameSpot that &quot;Grandia II&quot; will be receiving an HD remaster on Steam and GOG.com. Based on the Dreamcast version of the game, the port will have a mouse, keyboard, and gamepad support. Along with the visual definition upgrade, it will include Steam achievements and Trading Cards. On August 24, 2015, &quot;Grandia II Anniversary Edition&quot; for PC was released and features visual upgrades to textures / lighting / shadows, original Japanese voice option, additional difficulty level, gamepad support, Steam Trading Cards / Steam Achievements / Steam Cloud Save support (PC only), selectable video options, remappable keyboard &amp; gamepad support, 100 save file slots, Dreamcast VMS Save File Support.

The game received a remastered version on the Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Grandia HD Collection&quot; on August 16, 2019. &quot;Grandia II Anniversary Edition&quot; was updated with new features and renamed to &quot;Grandia II HD Remaster&quot; on October 15, 2019; customers who already own the &quot;Grandia II Anniversary Edition&quot; received the upgraded version for free. Changes in the remaster include enhanced details to UI / sprites / texture art, visual enhancements to original cinematic videos, widescreen support and customizable resolutions (PC only), Japanese and English audio, and additional French and German localization. The remaster was released in Japan and received Japanese language support in other regions, along with various fixes, on March 25, 2020.

== Reception ==
=== Dreamcast version ===
The original Dreamcast release of &quot;Grandia II&quot; received a largely positive response during its initial release in Japan, earning a 9.75 out of 10 rating from &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot;, as well as a 35 out of 40 from &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, which earned it the magazine&#x27;s editor&#x27;s choice Platinum award. &quot;Famitsu DC&quot; rated the game 26 out of 30 based on three reviews. Despite good reception, sales of the game remained relatively low in the region, with an estimated 184,863 copies sold.

&quot;Grandia II&quot;″s English release met with an overwhelmingly positive response. It received an aggregate score of 88.81% on GameRankings and 90/100 on Metacritic. &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine found the game to be &quot;solidly-built and features stunning visuals, dead-on controls, and a innovative combat system&quot; yet remarked that that game&#x27;s scenarios seemed too linear at times.

On a similar note, GameSpot stated that &quot;while the first Grandia had lengthy dungeons full of puzzles and side routes, Grandia II&#x27;s dungeons are more compartmental and linear affairs&quot;, the game was ultimately &quot;a solid RPG ... even if it isn&#x27;t as deep or difficult as the original.&quot; IGN granted the game an Editor&#x27;s Choice distinction, calling it a &quot;classic&quot; of the Dreamcast and remarking that its battle system was &quot;arguably the most advanced system in play today&quot;, yet found the game&#x27;s story and character development to be cliche and predictable.

Eurogamer also found the game&#x27;s story and gameplay to be largely methodical, and despite being dubbed &quot;the best RPG on the Dreamcast in Europe&quot; and &quot;strongly recommended&quot;, editors felt seasoned role-playing game players would find the game too generic, calling it &quot;an incredibly tough game to call&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; granted the game a 9 out of 10, earning it a Gold Award.

Francesca Reyes reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and called the game &quot;a winner in the RPG beauty pageant that&#x27;s just clever enough in the battle department to balance out an almost too straightforward storyline.&quot;

=== PlayStation 2 and PC ports ===
The PlayStation 2 rerelease of &quot;Grandia II&quot; in 2002 experienced lower sales than the Dreamcast version in Japan despite a higher install base, selling approximately 42,060 copies in its first month. In North America and Europe, the game received chiefly lower reviews than the original, with many publications remarking on the technical shortcomings of the port to the new console. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found the PlayStation version to be vastly inferior to the original, citing reduced frame rate, color, and texture quality, adding that its &quot;Inexplicably horrible graphics completely ruin an otherwise splendid title.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; found the conversion shortcomings to be essentially negligible, claiming that &quot;Grandia II&quot; &quot;still holds its own as a solidly constructed but direct port in the more crowded PlayStation 2 fantasy camp&quot; while asserting that it was still &quot;overshadowed by Final Fantasy X.&quot; IGN still regarded the PlayStation 2 version as &quot;a good game&quot; and one of the top role-playing games for the system at the time but remarked that the &quot;time and stress of transition&quot; as well as the emergence of other prominent games during the one-year time frame had diluted the port&#x27;s appeal. GameSpot called the Dreamcast release &quot;technically superior&quot;, but the new version was recommended to those who did not play the original and that it was still &quot;well worth playing&quot;.

Like the PlayStation 2 version, the PC release of &quot;Grandia II&quot; had a much milder response from critics than the Dreamcast version. Critiquing the game from a PC game standpoint, IGN PC stated, &quot;This game is not like a PC RPG. It&#x27;s light. It&#x27;s fluffy. It&#x27;s colorful. It&#x27;s not exactly deep. Its storyline is console stereotypical. Its jokes are silly. Its gameplay is cartoony. And the characters all have huge eyes and no mouths.&quot; But the reviewer added that &quot;Grandia II&quot; &quot;still manages to be fun, maybe even just because it&#x27;s so different than most of the dark, dreary and serious RPGs that find their ways to our favorite platform.&quot;

Similarly, GameSpot found that the game would be difficult for consumers accustomed to Western role-playing video games to get into, remarking that &quot;Grandia II&#x27;s linear gameplay, &#x27;young adult&#x27; sensibility, and anime artwork aren&#x27;t likely to impress someone looking for another Baldur&#x27;s Gate II. Still, Grandia II can be fun if you&#x27;re used to Japanese RPGs to begin with or if you approach it with an open mind.&quot;

<text>George Ramsay Cook (28 November 1931 – 14 July 2016) was a Canadian historian and general editor of the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot;. He was professor of history at the University of Toronto, 1958–1968; York University, 1969–1996; Visiting Professor of Canadian Studies, Harvard University, 1968–69; Visiting Professor, and Yale University, 1978–79 and 1997. Through his championing of so-called &quot;limited identities&quot;, Cook contributed to the rise of the New Social History, which uses &quot;class, gender and ethnicity&quot; as its three main categories of analysis. Cook&#x27;s conception of &quot;limited identities&quot; was famously formulated in an article in the &quot;International Journal&quot; in 1967, Canada&#x27;s centenary year, reviewing the state of contemporary scholarship on Canadian nationalism:

During his teaching career, Cook supervised the work of 39 PhD students and many prominent social historians such as Franca Iacovetta.

In 1997, the Ramsay Cook Research Scholarship was established at York University to honour his contribution to the field of history.

He publicly supported Pierre Elliott Trudeau in his successful attempt to gain the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1968.

He was married to Eleanor Cook, an English professor at the University of Toronto.

==Honours==
Cook received the Governor General&#x27;s Award for non-fiction in 1985 for &quot;The Regenerators: Social Criticism in Late Victorian English Canada.&quot; He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1986. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government in 1994. In 2005, Cook received the Molson Prize in Social Sciences and Humanities.

<doc id="618571" wikidata="Q534149" url="?curid=618571" title="Votadini">
<text>The Votadini, also known as the &quot;Uotadini&quot;, &quot;Wotādīni&quot;, &quot;Votādīni&quot;, or &quot;Otadini&quot; were a Brittonic people of the Iron Age in Great Britain. Their territory was in what is now south-east Scotland and north-east England, extending from the Firth of Forth and around modern Stirling to the River Tyne, including at its peak what are now the Falkirk, Lothian and Borders regions and Northumberland. This area was briefly part of the Roman province of &quot;Britannia&quot;. The earliest known capital of the Votadini appears to have been the Traprain Law hill fort in East Lothian, until that was abandoned in the early 5th century. They afterwards moved to Din Eidyn (Edinburgh).

The name is recorded as &quot;Votadini&quot; in classical sources, and as &quot;Otodini&quot; on old maps of ancient Roman Britain. Their descendants were the early medieval kingdom known in Old Welsh as Guotodin, and in later Welsh as Gododdin .

One of the oldest known pieces of British literature is a poem called &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, written in Old Welsh, having previously been passed down via the oral traditions of the Brythonic speaking Britons. This poem celebrates the bravery of the soldiers from what was later referred to by the Britons as &quot;Yr Hen Ogledd&quot; – The Old North; a reference to the fact that this land was lost in battle to an invading force at Catraeth (modern day Catterick).

==Prehistory==
The area was settled as early as 3000 BC, and offerings of that period imported from Cumbria and Wales left on the sacred hilltop at Cairnpapple Hill, West Lothian, show that by then there was a link with these areas. By around 1500 BC Traprain Law in East Lothian was already a place of burial, with evidence of occupation and signs of ramparts after 1000 BC. Excavation at Edinburgh Castle found late Bronze Age material from about 850 BC.

Brythonic Celtic culture and language spread into the area at some time after the 8th century BC, possibly through cultural contact rather than mass invasion, and systems of kingdoms developed. Numerous hillforts and settlements support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms recorded by the Romans, though evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic power was sometimes as significant as warfare.

==The Roman period==
In the 1st century the Romans recorded the Votadini as a British tribe. Between 138–162 they came under direct Roman military rule as occupants of the region between Hadrian&#x27;s and the Antonine Walls. Then when the Romans drew back to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall the Votadini became a friendly buffer state, getting the rewards of alliance with Rome without being under its rule, until about 400 when the Romans withdrew from southern Great Britain. Quantities of Roman goods found at Traprain Law, East Lothian might suggest that this proved profitable, though this is open to speculation.

Since the 3rd century, &quot;Britannia&quot; had been divided into four provinces. In a late reorganisation a province called Valentia was created, which may have been a new province, perhaps including the Votadini territory, but is more likely to have been one of the four existing provinces renamed.

Excavations in Votadini territory, especially around Traprain Law, have unearthed silver Roman items, including several Gallic Roman coins, indicating some level of trade with the continent. It is unknown, however, whether the other items were traded for, or given to them by the Romans as an appeasement.

==The post-Roman period==
After the Roman withdrawal in the early 5th century, the lands of the Votadini became part of the area known as the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; (the &quot;Old North&quot;).

By about 470, a new kingdom of Gododdin had emerged covering most of the original Votadini territory, while the southern part between the Tweed and the Tyne formed its own separate kingdom called Brynaich. Cunedda, legendary founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in north Wales, is said to have been a Gododdin chieftain who migrated south-west about this time.

Both kingdoms warred with the Angles of Bernicia; it is this warfare that is commemorated in Aneirin&#x27;s late 6th/early 7th century poem-cycle &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. However Gwynedd where Cunedda established a militaristic dynasty remained undefeated until the 13th century.

<text>Fathom Five National Marine Park is a National Marine Conservation Area in the Georgian Bay part of Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada, that seeks to protect and display shipwrecks and lighthouses, and conserve freshwater ecosystems. Parks Canada has management plans for the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, with a multi-action plan for species that are at risk, including endemic species, the Monarch butterfly, the eastern ribbonsnake, and the eastern whip-poor-will. The aquatic ecosystems in the park are also of particular interest. Many fish, shellfish, amphibians, and eels are an attraction for naturalists in the park. Much of this wildlife is accessible to scuba divers and snorkellers in the park. The many shipwrecks make the park a popular scuba diving destination, and glass bottom boat tours leave Tobermory regularly, allowing tourists to see the shipwrecks without having to get wet. Additionally, there are three main popular hiking trails found within Fathom Five National Marine Park that provides visitors with views of old growth forests and the Georgian Bay. The Saugeen Ojibway Peoples have inhabited the Bruce Peninsula and the area that is now Fathom Five National Marine Park for thousands of years. This land provided for their communities and their people with the plethora of wildlife and plant life. They provide the local knowledge about Lake Huron and its ecological value to the reserve, park, and their overall livelihood. Parks Canada and Saugeen Ojibway People&#x27;s collaboration is said to yield a benefit to both parties with regard to overall ecosystem knowledge.

Many visitors camp at nearby Bruce Peninsula National Park and use the park as a base to explore Fathom Five and the surrounding area during the day.

Fathom Five also contains numerous islands, notably Flowerpot Island, which has rough camping facilities, marked trails, and its namesake &quot;flowerpots&quot;, outlying stacks of escarpment cliff that stand a short distance from the island, most with vegetation (including trees) still growing on them.

The park was established on 20 July 1987 using the area of the Fathom Five Provincial Park and the western portion of the Georgian Bay Islands National Park. The park represented a pioneering departure for the national park system, which had centred on land-based conservation until then. Its designation as a &quot;National Marine Park&quot; foresaw the creation of others, though nomenclature for such units would morph into &quot;National Marine Conservation Areas&quot;, leaving Fathom Five as the only National Marine Park. Despite its unique name, it is categorized as an NMCA and is deemed the first one in the country.

== Visitors&#x27; centre ==

In 2006, a new visitors&#x27; centre opened to serve Fathom Five National Marine Park and the Bruce Peninsula National Park. Designed by Andrew Frontini of Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners, the CAD $7.82 million centre, approached by a boardwalk, features an information centre, reception area, exhibit hall and theatre. A 20-metre viewing tower was also constructed to provide visitors with aerial views of the surrounding park and Georgian Bay. The centre was designed with environmental sustainability in mind, receiving $224,000 from the Federal House in Order initiative for implementation of innovative greenhouse gas reduction technology.

== Recreation ==
With an annual visitation number of 490,388 from 2019-2021, Fathom Five National Marine Park is a popular destination among locals and tourists. The park has three main trails, which range in duration from five minutes to two hours. The Bruce Trail to Little Dunks Bay is approximately two kilometres long and provides visitors with a panoramic view of Little Dunks Bay and Georgian Bay. The Bruce Trail Burnt Point Loop has the longest hike of the three, encompassing 4.8 km, which passes through cedar forests and provides a stunning view of Georgian Bay. Visitors can embark on the shortest hike that is less than half a kilometre in length, passing by the visitor centre on their way to Tobermory Harbour.

== Park management ==
=== Management plan ===

The management plans for the Fathom Five National Park was made in 1998. The park was created to protect the longevity of the Georgian Bay marine biodiversity and environment. The aquatic ecosystems management was created to study the structure of the ecosystem and resources, protect species and habitats, and identify the impact of nonnative species and make management plans to take action if they negatively impact native species. The fish management plan was created to monitor the populations, and allow sustainable harvest through commercial and sport fishing. The terrestrial ecosystems management plan was created to monitor the islands’ biogeography and to and reduce human impact on the environment. This is done by preventing new species from being introduced and limiting public access to areas. Additionally, management requires environmental impact assessments to be done prior to any activities or development.

=== Management progress ===

The management progress was last reported by Parks Canada in 2010. The goals to conserve and monitor aquatic ecosystems is approximately 50% complete. The coastal ecosystems&#x27; water quality, water level, fish populations, and connectivity are in good condition. The island ecosystems&#x27; habitat and connectivity is in fair condition, and they are still developing the offshore and social indicators. The goals to preserve the terrestrial ecosystems are being met, and is in fair condition. The goal of having environmental impact assessments is also being followed prior to activities.

== Threatened and endangered species ==
A multi-species action plan to conserve threatened and endangered species was created by Parks Canada to be implemented in Fathom Five National Park and Bruce Peninsula National Park. The plan includes COSEWIC’s (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) identification of the species threat status, and plans to recover the population size and distribution of the species.

There are endemic species included in the plan, such as Dwarf Lake Iris (&quot;Iris lacurstris&quot;) and Lakeside Daisy (&quot;Tetraneuris  herbacea&quot;). The Dwarf Lake Iris&#x27;s status is of special concern, as it is only found in the Great Lakes basin, with one of its locations being Lake Huron. It is a perennial plant with blue or purple petals which blooms between mid-May and early June. The Lakeside Daisy status is also of special concern, as it is likewise only found near the Great Lakes. It is a perennial herb with yellow ray petals and blooms between May and early June.

=== Monarch butterfly ===
The monarch butterfly (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;) is a species of butterfly that is currently listed as a species of special concern in the province of Ontario. This migratory butterfly is found in Fathom Five Marine Park, as well as other parts of Southeast Canada and the Northeast United States during its breeding season in the summer. Upon breeding, the monarch butterflies embark on a mass migration of approximately 4,500 kilometres to their final resting place in Central Mexico. As a species of special concern, the monarch butterfly is neither threatened nor endangered. As a result of habitat loss and the use of pesticides and herbicides, the monarch butterfly&#x27;s natural habitat has been dramatically impacted. The monarch butterfly is a globally threatened species, and its numbers have declined dramatically throughout the past few decades, from 10 million butterflies in 1980 to 1914 butterflies in 2021.

=== Massassauga rattlesnake ===
The massassauga rattle snake (&quot;Sistrurus catenatus&quot;) is a species of snake listed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). This snake has a long, grayish-brown body with semi round spots throughout its body, and it ranges in size from 50–70 cm long. The species is found in the Fathom Five Marine Park, in habitats such as tall grass, bogs, marshes, shorelines, and forests. In addition to habitat loss caused by human expansion, these snakes are also at risk of being killed by motor vehicles or ill-intentioned humans. There are approximately 10,000 adult massasauga rattle snakes found throughout Eastern Ontario and Quebec; however, a substantial portion of this population can be found within the Fathom Five Marine Park and the Bruce Peninsula. Both the Massasauga - Great Lakes / St. Lawrence population and the Massasauga - Carolinian population are experiencing steady declines in population numbers.

=== Eastern ribbon snake ===
The eastern ribbon snake (&quot;Thamnophis saurita&quot;) is a species of snake that is listed as a &quot;special concern&quot; that is likely to become endangered if proper precautions aren&#x27;t taken. On its sides and back, the snake has three yellow stripes that easily distinguish it from other snakes. The Fathom Five Marine Park is home to this species of snake, which is normally found in environments near water. The snake is threatened by habitat loss as a result of human development. In addition, the eastern ribbon snake relies heavily on the ability to hunt amphibians as a result, the eastern ribbon snake is experiencing a decline in food availability due to habitat loss and degradation. Currently, there are an estimated 1,000-3,000 adult eastern ribbon snakes inhabiting Ontario, and their numbers are steadily declining.

=== Eastern whip-poor-will ===
The eastern whip-poor-will (&quot;Caprimulgus vociferus&quot;) is currently listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), and if proper measures are not taken it may become endangered. Easter whip-poor-wills can be found in the Fathom Five Marine Park. They are distinguished by their medium size and brown and grey feathers that provide them with excellent camouflage so that they can blend in with the surroundings. The eastern whip-poor-will is generally found in open woodlands with mixed conifers and deciduous trees. Threats to the eastern whip-poor-will are directly caused by the loss and degradation of their habitat. From 1968-2007, the number of eastern whip-poor-wills has decreased by nearly 75% of its original population in Canada, and its population is gradually decreasing at a rate of 3.2% per year.

== Climate change ==
There is a very real threat associated with climate change on a global scale, but especially within Canada. According to current projections, the province of Ontario will experience an increase in average temperatures of 2.6-2.7 degrees Celsius by 2030 and 5.9-7.4 degrees Celsius by 2080. A further consequence of climate change will be an increase in precipitation by 4.5%-7.1% in Ontario and a possible increase of 3.2%-17.5% by 2080. It is anticipated that climate change could have dramatic effects on species such as the monarch butterfly, the massassauga rattlesnake, the eastern ribbon snake, and the eastern whip-poor-will, which are already on the endangered list. Increasing temperatures and precipitation will lead to more frequent flooding, droughts, and extreme weather events. Due to these impacts, there will be a drastic decrease in viable food sources for monarch butterflies, such as milkweed. It is anticipated that the flooding will negatively impact the landscapes in which massassauga rattlesnakes, eastern ribbon snakes, and eastern whip-poor-wills rely heavily on for shelter, food, and protection.

== Aquatic wildlife ==
=== Native aquatic wildlife ===

Lake Huron is home to 139 native fish species, many of which are found in Fathom Five Provincial park. Some examples include sculpins, gizzard shad, shiners, and ciscoes. These fish sustain populations of larger predatory species such as pike, muskellunge, large and smallmouth bass, brook trout, and walleye. These native species are dispersed throughout the great lakes watershed.

Lake Huron is also home to eight native turtle species, including the spotted turtle (&quot;Clemmys guttata&quot;), Blanding’s turtle (&quot;Emydoidea blandingii&quot;), spiny softshell turtle (&quot;Apalone spinifera&quot;), northern map turtle (&quot;Graptemys geographica&quot;), eastern musk turtle (&quot;Sternotherus odoratus&quot;), snapping turtle (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;), midland painted turtle (&quot;Chrysemys picta marginata&quot;), and wood turtle (&quot;Glyptemys insculpta&quot;). Out of these species, two are listed as endangered, two are listed &quot;threatened&quot;, and three species are of special concern. The reduction of coastal wetlands has greatly impacted turtles in Lake Huron, including the Bruce Peninsula. Fathom Five National park is home to several wetlands. These wetlands are critical habitat to sensitive species such as turtles, black terns, king rails, herons, Black crest night herons and other species of special concern.

=== Non-native aquatic wildlife ===

Lake Huron is home to several introduced and invasive species. Pacific salmon were introduced to Lake Huron; specifically, Chinook, coho and pink salmon were intentionally introduced by sport fishermen. Additionally, invasive species introduced via ballast water, man-made canals, aquaculture, and the pet trade have established large populations within the lakes. Lampreys, alewives, and quagga mussels are the most common examples of invasive species in the Great Lakes.

Invasive species have affected the lake ecosystem considerably. Quagga mussels are filter feeders, and filter water through their siphons in order to trap algae and plankton. These mussels are so prevalent that their filtration has drastically changed the clarity of the water, allowing algae to grow on rock structures on the lake bed where it would not previously be present. Predatory fish have also been affected greatly by invasive species. The clarity of the water, created by quagga mussels, causes ambush predators to be less successful in ambushing prey. Keystone native species such as lake trout, muskellunge, and pike have been greatly affected by this change. Large fish species have also been affected by the sea lamprey.

Lampreys are a parasitic predator, and attach themselves to large fish and feed on the blood of their prey. Lampreys are native to the Great Lakes; Silver, chestnut, American brook, and northern brook lamprey are native to streams and rivers in the watershed of the Great Lakes, including Lake Huron. Native lampreys are not large enough to have a significant effect on the fish they prey on, however invasive sea lampreys are much larger, and fish that they prey on are much more prone to die as they are not used to such large parasites. It was estimated that only one in seven fish preyed on by sea lampreys would survive.

== First Nations ==
Fathom Five National Marine Park is part of the traditional unceded territory of Saugeen Ojibway people. Oral history dates the presence of Saugeen Ojibway peoples around 5480 BCE. The peninsula is a spiritual destination for many Ojibway Nations, who would travel to the peninsula to partake in potlatches and ceremonies throughout the seasons. The traditional territory of the Saugeen Ojibway included the modern day towns of Collingwood, Arthur, Alliston, and Goderich, the watersheds of the Saugeen river, the Sauble river, the Wasaga river and the islands surrounding the Bruce peninsula. The Saugeen people speak a dialect of the Algonquin language.

=== Food security ===
Food security for the Saugeen Ojibway people has been an ongoing political issue. All the major fisheries are located on the Saugeen Ojibway people&#x27;s region and it is their main source of food. The local fisheries have been dominated by big corporations. This food resource needs to have legal access by Saugeen Ojibway people granted by the government. Prior to European arrival the Saugeen Ojibway people&#x27;s territory extended as far as Southern Ontario. This includes extending into southern Ontario, 500 km of shoreline and of Lake Huron, and harvesting rights on of a hunting reserve. Commercial food markets do exist around the region and are a 25 minute drive from the reserve. Though this creates a challenge for those with no access to a motor vehicle. The older demographic of the Saugeen Ojibway people expressed that there is a decline in the Lake Huron&#x27;s whitefish population. The whitefish is symbolic of cultural and generational ceremonies for the Saugeen Ojibway people. It is a symbol of a successful harvest and the Saugeen Ojibway people have a ceremony where the &quot;chief&quot; summons the whitefish and appreciate the lake for providing them with source of food and livelihood. These are age old rituals that have been practiced since the 1800s where the Saugeen Ojibway people surrendered their land to the British crown.

=== Parks Canada and Saugeen Ojibway people ===
Parks Canada is a Federal agency that specializes in protection and conservation of national parks throughout Canada. The entity was formed to ensure the preservation of ecological indicators and species. The Giigoonyang (Fishes) project collaboration between Saugeen Ojibway people and Parks Canada. The collaboration is designed to combine indigenous knowledge about the land area with western technology. Researchers will use this to monitor and analyze fisheries data to forecast population growth or decline. This research is essential as it ensures food security for the Saugeen Ojibway people territory. Since it is their primary source that they rely on, this collaboration will benefit both parties involved. Since Parks Canada is a Federal agency, it will allow the Saugeen Ojibway people to make necessary progress in their legal demands for their food security and territory. A Federal agency is more likely to implement effective change in comparison to a provincial entity due to the hierarchal structure of the government agencies in Canada. The secondary goal of Parks Canada is to fill the knowledge gap they have with regards to Fathom Five National Marine Park&#x27;s lake systems. Specific to fish migration and ecosystems that directly affect the fisheries industry. The main aim is to be able to create sustainable fishing practices in order to ensure Lake Huron&#x27;s fish population.

== Shipwrecks ==

The park is home to several shipwrecks, many of which are used for scuba diving and some shallower ones are used for snorkelling.

The park also has three non-shipwreck dive sites, these are Dunks Point, Big Tub Lighthouse Point and The Anchor.

<doc id="618579" wikidata="Q2377938" url="?curid=618579" title="Glass-bottom boat">
<text>A glass-bottom boat is a boat with sections of glass, panoramic bottom glass or other suitable transparent material, below the waterline allowing passengers to observe the underwater environment from within the boat. The view through the glass bottom is better than simply looking into the water from above, because one does not have to look through optically erratic surface disturbances. The effect is similar to that achieved by a diving mask, while the passengers are able to stay dry and out of the water.

== Use ==
Glass-bottom boats are used for giving tours, as they are usually designed to allow the maximum number of tourists to view out the glass bottom. 

Glass-bottom boats are in use in many seaside tourist destinations as well as lake towns.

Typical tours in these boats include views of underwater flora and fauna, reefs, shipwrecks, and other underwater sights.

== History ==
The glass-bottom boat was invented in 1878 by two men, Hullam Jones and Philip Morrell, in Marion County, Florida. Jones outfitted a dugout canoe with a glass viewing box at the bottom, which allowed tourists to view the clear waters of Silver Springs, Florida. Eventually, the spring was purchased by Col. W.M. Davidson and Carl Ray, who developed a gasoline-powered glass-bottom boat in 1924.

<text>In mathematics, computational group theory is the study of
groups by means of computers. It is concerned
with designing and analysing algorithms and
data structures to compute information about groups. The subject
has attracted interest because for many interesting groups
(including most of the sporadic groups) it is impractical
to perform calculations by hand.

Important algorithms in computational group theory include:
* the Schreier–Sims algorithm for finding the order of a permutation group
* the Todd–Coxeter algorithm and Knuth–Bendix algorithm for coset enumeration
* the product-replacement algorithm for finding random elements of a group

Two important computer algebra systems (CAS) used for group theory are
GAP and Magma. Historically, other systems such as CAS (for character theory) and Cayley (a predecessor of Magma) were important.

Some achievements of the field include:
* complete enumeration of all finite groups of order less than 2000
* computation of representations for all the sporadic groups

<doc id="618588" wikidata="Q1785911" url="?curid=618588" title="British Mediterranean Airways">
<text>British Mediterranean Airways Limited (BMED), stylised as B|MED, was an airline with operations from London Heathrow Airport in England. It operated scheduled services as a British Airways franchise to 17 destinations in 16 countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia from London Heathrow. In February 2007, the airline was purchased by BMI, and continued as a British Airways franchise until the night of 27 October 2007, when it was absorbed into, and rebranded as, bmi.

Before the takeover it was headquartered at the Hetherington House in London Borough of Hounslow, near London Heathrow Airport. At an earlier point it was headquartered at the Cirrus House in the Borough of Hounslow, near Staines-upon-Thames and Stanwell, Surrey. At an earlier point its head office was in the City of Westminster.

The company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats. The licence was revoked on 31 January 2008.

== History ==
British Mediterranean Airways was established as a limited company in 1994 by a group of private investors led by Lord Hesketh. It began operations on 28 October that year. The airline operated the Airbus A320 from London Heathrow to Beirut, Lebanon. Damascus in Syria and Amman in Jordan were added to the network the following year, and the airline began flying a fortnightly charter service to Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan.

In March 1997 the airline reached an agreement with British Airways, with BA withdrawing its competing services to Beirut, Damascus and Amman, leaving British Mediterranean as the sole operator on a BA franchise basis. Under this agreement the airline traded as British Airways, with all flights operated under BA flight codes (the range BA6500-6669 were allocated to BMED flights). All BMED aircraft were presented in full British Airways livery, appointed with the same interior and class product as the BA main fleet, and staff wore the BA uniform. BMED flights were booked through British Airways and the airline participated in BA&#x27;s Executive Club and BA Miles programme. BMED was an affiliate member of Oneworld.

With the franchise agreement, British Mediterranean&#x27;s operations moved from Heathrow&#x27;s Terminal 3 to Terminal 4, allowing greater integration with the BA network. The airline greatly benefited from the franchise arrangement, taking over unprofitable BA mainline services better suited to BMED&#x27;s lower cost base, to destinations such as Baku, Tehran, Addis Ababa and Almaty. British Mediterranean also launched a number of routes on its own, backed by the global sales and marketing of British Airways, as well as feeder traffic to and from Heathrow.

In 2004 BMED carried 277,000 passengers on its 6 aircraft, to 18 destinations in 17 countries. At that time BMED had flights to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. British Mediterranean Airways rebranded as BMED in November 2004, stating that the shorter name and revamped logo would help strengthen the airline&#x27;s image.

On 12 March 2007, it was revealed that the airline was flying a &quot;ghost flight&quot; between London Heathrow and Cardiff International Airport six times a week. No seats were sold for the flight, and it was not announced in arrivals or departures, or on airport information screens. The flight was only made in order for BMED to retain a valuable take-off slot at London Heathrow, unused since it scrapped flights to Uzbekistan. Airlines with landing rights at London Heathrow are liable to lose them if they do not make at least 80% use of their allocation over a six-month session.

On 5 April 2007, G-MEDL was used to return 15 British Navy personnel captured by Iranian forces from Tehran to London Heathrow.

===&quot;Impressions&quot; Inflight Magazine===
The British Mediterranean Airways inflight magazine, titled &quot;Impressions&quot;, was the first for Ink now one of the world&#x27;s largest publishers of such periodicals.

===Sale to BMI===
Following a period of losses, the airline was bought by BMI for £30 million in February 2007. The acquisition marked a change in strategy for BMI by focusing on more medium to long-haul routes. BMED&#x27;s route network complemented BMI&#x27;s existing routes.

The British Airways franchise ended on 27 October 2007, when the airline was fully absorbed into BMI branding. Aircraft were gradually repainted in the BMI livery, and flights received BMI&#x27;s flight codes. As part of the acquisition, BMI sold BMED&#x27;s Heathrow slots to British Airways for £30 million, to be transferred in late 2008.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 31 March 2003, British Mediterranean Airways Flight 6711, an Airbus A320, was involved in a serious incident while approaching Addis Ababa Airport, Ethiopia. The pilots were unaware of a significant discrepancy in the aircraft flight management system position caused by the sole navigational beacon transmitting erroneous data. This same beacon was also being used to navigate the approach. The crew executed a go-around, the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) &quot;TERRAIN AHEAD, PULL UP&quot; audio warning was triggered too late to be of any help, and later analysis showed that the aircraft passed within 56 ft of terrain at its closest point. The AAIB determined that improper maintenance of the ADS VOR beacon had allowed water ingress causing the erroneous signal, which should have been detected by monitoring equipment, but this had been disconnected during construction work. Also, the Airbus EGPWS design relied on the same positional information as the navigation system.

==Fleet==

The BMED fleet consisted of the following aircraft (at 27 October 2007):

*3 Airbus A320-200
*5 Airbus A321-200 (further 5 on order)

<doc id="618592" wikidata="Q12237297" url="?curid=618592" title="Languages of the Caucasus">
<text>The Caucasian languages comprise a large and extremely varied array of languages spoken by more than ten million people in and around the Caucasus Mountains, which lie between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.

Linguistic comparison allows the classification of these languages into several different language families, with little or no discernible affinity to each other. However, the languages of the Caucasus are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a &quot;family&quot; of languages. According to Asya Pereltsvaig, &quot;grammatical differences between the three groups of languages are considerable. [...] These differences force the more conservative historical linguistics to treat the three language families of the Caucasus as unrelated.&quot;

== Families indigenous to the Caucasus ==

Three of these families have no current indigenous members outside the Caucasus, and are considered indigenous to the area. The term Caucasian languages is generally restricted to these families, which are spoken by about 11.2 million people.

* Kartvelian, also known as the South Caucasian or Iberian language family, with a total of about 4.3 million speakers. Includes Georgian, the official language of Georgia, with four million speakers, Svan with 14,000 speakers, Mingrelian with 345,000 speakers, and Laz with 22,000 speakers.
* Northeast Caucasian, also called the Nakh-Daghestanian or Caspian family, with a total of about 4.3 million speakers. Includes Chechen with 1.7 million speakers, Avar with 1 million speakers, Dargwa with 590,000 speakers, Ingush with 500,000 speakers, Lezgian with 800,000 speakers, and others.
* Northwest Caucasian, also called the Abkhazo-Adyghean, Circassian, or Pontic family, with a total of about 2 million speakers. Includes Kabardian, with one million speakers, Adyghe with 610,000 speakers, Abkhaz with 190,000 speakers, and Abaza with 85,000 speakers.

The Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families are notable for their high number of consonant phonemes (inventories range up to the 80–84 consonants of Ubykh). The consonant inventories of the South Caucasian languages, however, are not nearly as extensive, ranging from 28 (Georgian) to 32 (Svan) – comparable to languages like Russian (up to 37 consonant phonemes, depending on definition), Arabic (28 phonemes), and Western European languages (often more than 20 phonemes).

The autochthonous languages of the Caucasus share some areal features, such as the presence of ejective consonants and a highly agglutinative structure, and, with the sole exception of Mingrelian, all of them exhibit a greater or lesser degree of ergativity. Many of these features are shared with other languages that have been in the Caucasus for a long time, such as Ossetian (which has ejective sounds but no ergativity).

=== External relations ===
Since the birth of comparative linguistics in the 19th century, the riddle of the apparently isolated Caucasian language families has attracted the attention of many scholars, who have endeavored to relate them to each other or to languages outside the Caucasus region. The most promising proposals are connections between the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families and each other or with languages formerly spoken in Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia.

==== North Caucasian languages ====

Linguists such as Sergei Starostin see the Northeast (Nakh-Dagestanian) and Northwest (Abkhaz–Adyghe) families as related and propose uniting them in a single North Caucasian family, sometimes called Caucasic or simply Caucasian. This theory excludes the South Caucasian languages, thereby proposing two indigenous language families. While these two families share many similarities, their morphological structure, with many morphemes consisting of a single consonant, make comparison between them unusually difficult, and it has not been possible to establish a genetic relationship with any certainty.

==== Ibero-Caucasian languages ====

There are no known affinities between the South Caucasian and North Caucasian families. Nevertheless, some scholars have proposed the single name Ibero-Caucasian for all the Caucasian language families, North and South, in an attempt to unify the Caucasian languages under one family.

==== Hattic ====
Some linguists have claimed affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct Hattic language of central Anatolia. See the article on Northwest Caucasian languages for details.

==== Alarodian ====

Alarodian is a proposed connection between Northeast Caucasian and the extinct Hurro-Urartian languages of Anatolia.

==== Dené–Caucasian macrofamily ====

Linguists such as Sergei Starostin have proposed a Dené–Caucasian macrofamily, which includes the North Caucasian languages together with Basque, Burushaski, Na-Dené, Sino-Tibetan, and Yeniseian. This proposal is rejected by most linguists.

== Families with wider distribution ==
Other languages historically and currently spoken in the Caucasus area can be placed into families with a much wider geographical distribution.

=== Indo-European ===
The predominant Indo-European language in the Caucasus is Armenian, spoken by the Armenians (circa 6.7 million speakers). The Ossetians, speaking the Ossetian language, form another group of around 700,000 speakers. Other Indo-European languages spoken in the Caucasus include Greek (Pontic Greek), Persian (including Tat Persian), Kurdish, Talysh, Judeo-Tat, and the Slavic languages, such as Russian and Ukrainian, whose speakers number over a third of the total population of the Caucasus.

=== Semitic ===
Two dialects of Neo-Aramaic are spoken in the Caucasus: Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, with around 30,000 speakers, and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, with around 1,000 speakers. Both of these were brought to the Caucasus by ethnic Assyrians fleeing the Sayfo or Assyrian genocide during World War I.

A dialect of Arabic known as Shirvani Arabic was spoken natively in parts of Azerbaijan and Dagestan throughout medieval times until the early 20th century. In the nineteenth century, it was considered that the best literary Arabic was spoken in the mountains of Dagestan.

=== Turkic ===
Several Turkic languages are spoken in the Caucasus. Of these, Azerbaijani is predominant, with around 9 million speakers in Azerbaijan and more than 10 million in North Western Iran. Other Turkic languages spoken include Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai, Turkish, Turkmen and Urum.

=== Mongolic ===
Kalmyk Oirat, spoken by descendants of Oirat-speakers from East Asia, is a Mongolic language.

<doc id="618595" wikidata="Q1257902" url="?curid=618595" title="Shamshir">
<text>A shamshir () is a type of Persian/Iranian sword with a radical curve. The name is derived from the Persian word &quot;shamshīr&quot;, which is made of two words &quot;sham&quot; (&quot;fang&quot;) and &quot;shir&quot; (&quot;lion&quot;). The curved &quot;scimitar&quot; sword family includes the shamshir, kilij, talwar, pulwar, and nimcha.

A &quot;shamshir shekargar&quot; () is the same as a &quot;shamshir&quot;, except the blade is engraved and decorated, usually with hunting scenes.

==Description==
Originally, Persian swords were straight and double edged. Curved blades were Egyptian in origin. There is considerable disagreement between historians as to when these curved blades were first introduced from Central Asia into Persia, and over what period they became adopted and modified into the recognizable Shamshir. Curved blades began to appear in Persia in the 9th century, when these weapons were used by soldiers in the Khorasan region of Central Asia but were not widely adopted. The sword now called a &quot;shamshir&quot; was developed in Persia over a period of time following influence from the Turkic Seljuk Khanate in the 12th century, the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, and finally taking a form distinct from earlier sabres by the 16th century. The Shamshir had &quot;relatives&quot; in Turkey (the kilij), the Mughal Empire (the talwar), and the adjoining Arabian world (the saif). Over the years blades might be produced in India or the Ottoman empire and rehilted in Persia, and vice versa leading to mongrel swords.

The shamshir is a curved sword, featuring a slim blade that has almost no taper until the very tip. Instead of being worn upright (hilt-high), it is worn horizontally, with the hilt and tip pointing up. It was normally used for slashing unarmored opponents either on foot or mounted; while the tip could be used for thrusting, the drastic curvature of blade made accuracy more difficult. It has an offset pommel, and its two lengthy quillons form a simple crossguard. The tang of the blade is covered by slabs of bone, ivory, wood, or other material fastened by pins or rivets to form the grip. Many of the older Persian shamshir blades are made from high quality crucible wootz steel and are noted for the fine &quot;watering&quot; on the blades.

==Etymology==
Although the name has been associated by popular etymology with the city of Shamshir (which in turn means &quot;curved like the lion&#x27;s claw&quot; in Persian) the word has been used to mean &quot;sword&quot; since ancient times, as attested by Middle Persian &quot;shamshir&quot; (Pahlavi &quot;šmšyl&quot;), and the Ancient Greek σαμψήρα / &quot;sampsēra&quot; (glossed as &quot;foreign sword&quot;).

&quot;Shamshir&quot; is usually taken to be the root of the word scimitar, the latter being a broader term.

<doc id="618596" wikidata="Q1639610" url="?curid=618596" title="Wilgefortis">
<text>Wilgefortis () is a female folk saint whose legend arose in the 14th century, and whose distinguishing feature is a large beard. According to the legend of her life, set in Portugal and Galicia, she was a teenage noblewoman who had been promised in marriage by her father to a Moorish king. To thwart the unwanted wedding, she had taken a vow of virginity, and prayed that she would be made repulsive. In answer to her prayers she sprouted a beard, which ended the engagement. In anger, Wilgefortis&#x27; father had her crucified.

Her name is thought to have derived from the Latin &quot;virgo fortis&quot; (&quot;courageous virgin&quot;). In England her name was Uncumber, and in Dutch Ontkommer (meaning one who avoids something, here specifically other people from suffering).

In German lands she was known as Kümmernis (&quot;grief&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot;). In Poland she was called Frasobliwa (&quot;sorrowful&quot;). She was sometimes confused with a female martyr saint known as Liberata in Italy and Librada in Spain (&quot;liberated&quot;) whose feast day is on July 10; while Saint Liberata is a crucified, beardless female usually with a crown, Wilgefortis is always depicted with a beard and generally crownless. In France Wilgefortis is known as Débarras (&quot;riddance&quot;). The confusion between the martyr Saint Liberata and Wilgefortis extended to places such as Sigüenza, Spain, where Liberata was widely venerated.

While venerated by some Catholics, Wilgefortis was never officially canonised by the church, but instead was a popular intercessor for people seeking relief from tribulations, in particular by women who wished to be liberated (&quot;disencumbered&quot;) from abusive husbands.

== History ==

Art historians have argued that the origins of the art can be found with Eastern-style representations of the crucified Christ, and in particular the &quot;Holy Face of Lucca&quot;, a large 11th-century carved wooden figure of Christ on the Cross (now replaced by a 13th-century copy), bearded like a man, but dressed in a full-length tunic that might have appeared to be like that of a woman instead of the loin cloth familiar and by the Late Middle Ages normal in depictions in the West.

The Holy Face is sometimes described as typical of early Byzantine robed crucifixes. But no comparable large carved figures formed part of Byzantine art, whilst there are several surviving from Germany. Any Byzantine influence is very remote, as the face and hair are typical of German crucifixes, and many Ottonian manuscripts show robes in crucifixions. The Byzantine examples are from icons, illuminations or small relief carvings.

The theory is that when the composition was copied and brought north of the Alps over the next 150 years, in small copies by pilgrims and dealers, this unfamiliar image led Northerners to create a narrative to explain the androgynous icon. Some older images of the crucified Christ were repurposed as Wilgefortis, and new images clearly intended to represent the saint created, many with female clothes and breasts. Some older images of Christ on the cross are argued to have already deliberately included hints at an androgynous figure for theological reasons. Single images normally showed Wilgefortis on her cross, but two prominent standing images where she carries a smaller cross as an attribute as part of a group of saints, are mentioned below. Images showing a set of scenes covering the whole legend are unusual, but a German one of 1513 is illustrated here.

== Veneration ==

The popularity of prayer in the period of the Middle Ages has been connected to the &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot; and related devotion, where meditation on and identification with the sufferings of Christ was encouraged by writers such as Thomas à Kempis author of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; or mostly encouraged by the Groote to focus on the personal structure of simplicity, obedience, and followed the book The Imitation of Christ circulating from the 1420s.

St. Wilgefortis remained popular in the North of England until the end of the Gothic period; there is a carving in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey of Wilgefortis, standing while holding a cross, with a very long beard. She also appears in a similar pose, very lightly bearded, on the outside of a triptych door by Hans Memling.

Her cult was decisively suppressed during the late 16th century (after a period in the 15th and 16th centuries in which she was popular), and thereafter disappears from high art, although lingering well into the 20th century in more popular forms, especially in Bavaria and Austria, but also in northern France and Belgium. In the 12th-century church of Saint-Etienne in Beauvais, there is a 16th-century wooden statue of Saint Wilgefortis on the cross. She is depicted in a full blue tunic with a substantial beard. She is venerated by the name of Santa Librada in Argentina and Panama.

She is often shown with a small fiddler at her feet, and with one shoe off. This derives from a legend, also attached to the Volto Santo of Lucca, of a silver shoe with which the statue had been clothed dropping spontaneously at the feet of a poor pilgrim. In Wilgefortis&#x27;s version, the poor devotee became a fiddler, perhaps in the 13th century.

<doc id="618598" wikidata="Q7331770" url="?curid=618598" title="Rick Stein">
<text>Christopher Richard Stein, (born 4 January 1947) is an English celebrity chef, restaurateur, writer and television presenter. Along with business partner (and first wife) Jill Stein, he runs the Stein hotel and restaurant business in the UK. The business has a number of renowned restaurants, shops and hotels in Padstow along with other restaurants in Marlborough, Winchester and Barnes. He is also the head chef and a co-owner of the &quot;Rick Stein at Bannisters&quot; restaurants in Mollymook and Port Stephens in Australia, with his second wife, Sarah. He writes cookery books and has presented numerous cookery series for the BBC.

==Early years==
Of German descent, Christopher Richard Stein was born on 4 January 1947 in Churchill, Oxfordshire, to Eric Stein (1908-1965) and Dorothy Gertrude née Jackson (1909-1999). He was born and brought up on a farm.

Stein was educated at Wells Court, a preparatory school just outside Tewkesbury, then Wells House, the Court&#x27;s bigger sister-school at Malvern Wells, and then Uppingham School. He took A-levels in English, history and geography, but failed all of them. He moved to a cram school in Brighton, gaining E grades in English and history.

Stein partially completed a hotel management traineeship with British Transport Hotels at its Great Western Royal Hotel in Paddington. He worked there as a chef for six months. Distraught by his father&#x27;s suicide, at age 19 he went to Australia, where he worked as a labourer in an abattoir and as a clerk in a naval dockyard. He travelled to New Zealand and Mexico around that time to &quot;take some time out&quot;.

Being on his own, he read widely, reflected on his attitude to education, and applied successfully to New College, Oxford, where he earned an English degree in 1971. Shortly after that, he moved to Padstow.

==Career==
After graduating, Stein converted a mobile disco in Padstow, which he had run as a student, into a quayside nightclub with his friend, Johnny. It became known for its freeze-dried curries. However, the nightclub lost its licence and was closed down by the police, mainly due to frequent brawls with local fishermen. The pair still had a licence for a restaurant in another part of the building, so they continued with that to avoid bankruptcy. Stein ran the kitchen using the experience he had gained as a commis chef. Eventually he converted it into a small harbour-side bistro, The Seafood Restaurant, with his first wife Jill in 1975. , his business operates four restaurants, a bistro, a café, a seafood delicatessen, a pâtisserie shop, a gift shop and a cookery school. 

In 2007, threats against Stein&#x27;s businesses were made by Cornish nationalists. His impact on the economy of Padstow is such that it has been nicknamed &quot;Padstein&quot;. In 2009, Stein made his first acquisition in the nearby village of St Merryn, from Padstow, taking over the Cornish Arms public house on the village&#x27;s outskirts, intending to keep it as a traditional Cornish pub.

In October 2009, Stein and his future second wife (fiancée at the time), the publicist Sarah Burns, opened Rick Stein at Bannisters in Mollymook, Australia. Stein said at the time of opening, &quot;Ever since a memorable weekend eating Pambula oysters and flathead in Merimbula in the sixties, I&#x27;ve had the image of the clean blue sea and sweet seafood of the South Coast fixed in my head so when I was introduced to Mollymook about six years ago I knew that one day I would open up a restaurant celebrating local fish and shellfish but keeping it really simple.&quot;

In 2018, Stein opened a second Rick Stein at Bannisters in Salamander Bay in Port Stephens, with his second wife, Sarah. Stein has become a popular television presenter on food programmes. After appearing once as a guest chef in Keith Floyd&#x27;s 1985 series &quot;Floyd on Fish&quot; and in his 1986 series &quot;Floyd on Food&quot;, he was offered the chance to present his own series – like the &quot;travelogue&quot; style of cookery show pioneered by Floyd – on BBC television, using Floyd&#x27;s producer and director David Pritchard.

His shows have included &quot;Rick Stein&#x27;s Taste of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Fruits of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Seafood Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Fresh Food&quot;, &quot;Seafood Lovers&#x27; Guide&quot;, &quot;Food Heroes&quot;, &quot;French Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean Escapes&quot;, &quot;Far Eastern Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Rick Stein&#x27;s Spain&quot; and &quot;Rick Stein&#x27;s India&quot;. In the last five series, he set out in search of the best in the region&#x27;s foods.

Stein was often accompanied by his Jack Russell Terrier, Chalky, until his death in 2007. So popular was Chalky that Sharp&#x27;s Brewery named two speciality beers after him.

A book has accompanied each series, and Stein&#x27;s book &quot;English Seafood Cookery&quot; won the Glenfiddich Award for Food Book of the Year in 1989. Stein was awarded the OBE in the 2003 New Year Honours for services to tourism in Cornwall and the CBE in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to the economy.

On 22 June 2020, it was confirmed that Stein&#x27;s restaurant in Porthleven, Cornwall would close permanently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The restaurant had been closed since March 2020. In July 2020, it was announced that chef Michael Caines would take over the restaurant.

==Personal life==

In 1965, when Stein was 18, his father, a retired managing director of The Distillers Company, who suffered from bipolar disorder, killed himself by jumping from a cliff near the family&#x27;s holiday home at Trevose Head.

Stein met his first wife Jill Newstead in Padstow. They married in 1975, both aged 28, and set up their restaurant and hotel business. Stein has three sons with Jill: Edward, Jack, and Charles who are involved in the family business.

Stein met Sarah Burns, 20 years his junior, in Australia in 1997, when he was 50. She was also married, and working as a publicity manager for &quot;Australia Gourmet Traveller&quot; magazine. Stein and Burns had a secret five-year affair before Jill found out in 2002. She and Stein separated in 2002 and divorced in 2007, but agreed to continue to run the business together. Burns divorced in 2003, and she and Stein married on 7 October 2011.

Stein has a brother, John, and a sister, Henrietta. He also has a half-brother, Jeremy, his mother&#x27;s son from her first marriage. He is the uncle of DJ and music producer Judge Jules, and the artist Lucy Stein.

In 2022, Stein underwent open heart surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital to repair a defective heart valve. Appearing live on BBC&#x27;s The One Show in October 2023, promoting his book, &quot;Simple Suppers&quot;, he shared that his heart surgery experience had inspired his back to basics recipes but he inadvertently used a swear word and the show&#x27;s host and Stein had to apologise for the error.

After emigrating with his family to Britain from Canada when he was 7 years old, he taught himself the clarinet, and first joined a revivalist jazz band with George Webb in 1944. He later created a new, more mainstream band with friend Humphrey Lyttelton, and it soon became one of the leading British jazz bands of the 1950s.

Fawkes also achieved success illustrating cartoons under the pen name &quot;Trog&quot;. His most notable work in this business was &quot;Flook&quot;, a comic strip which ran in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; newspaper from 1949 to 1984. Initially aimed at children, the strip evolved over time into a gentle satire of British politics. When &quot;Flook&quot; ended he continued to illustrate until failing eyesight forced him to retire in 2005 at age 81, leaving him to concentrate solely on his clarinet playing.

==Early life==
Fawkes was born on 21 June 1924, as Walter Ernest Pearsall in Vancouver, British Columbia. His father, Douglas Pearsall, was a Canadian railway clerk whom his mother, Mabel ( Ainsley), later left for Charles Fawkes, a British printer. Mabel took her children with Charles to Britain in 1931.

Enthused by comic books from a young age, Fawkes left school at 14 with a scholarship to study at Sidcup Art School, although he later left after 18 months due to financial restraints. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Fawkes was first employed painting camouflage on factory roofs to hide them from enemy bombing. A bout of pleurisy made Fawkes unfit for service and he was instead employed by the Coal Commission to work on maps of coal seams.

==Career==
===As a jazz musician===
It was during the war years that Fawkes began playing in jazz bands.
In 1947, he took a weekly course at the Camberwell School of Art in London where he met future friends Humphrey Lyttelton and Francis Wilford-Smith. Lyttelton would become a long-lasting close friend. Fawkes later joined George Webb&#x27;s Dixielanders, a semi-professional revivalist jazz band that featured Lyttelton on trumpet, in 1944. When Lyttelton left the Dixielanders in January 1948 to form his own jazz band, Fawkes went with him and stayed there until 1956, by which time it had evolved past revivalism and became more mainstream. This suited Fawkes, as his own bands from then on could be broadly described as mainstream. He re-united with Lyttelton periodically thereafter, and, though highly talented on his instrument, remained (in the broadest sense of the term) an &quot;amateur&quot;. He based his style on that of American jazz composer Sidney Bechet and once recorded with him and Louis Armstrong, as part of Lyttelton&#x27;s band, in 1949. He played with George Melly and John Chilton in the Feetwarmers band in the early 1970s. After giving up illustrating in 2005, Fawkes continued to play in various bands, with one of his last performances being held in 2011.

===As a cartoonist===
In 1942, he entered an art competition that was judged by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s chief cartoonist Leslie Illingworth, who found him work with the Clement Davies advertising agency. On Fawkes&#x27; 21st birthday in 1945, Illingworth found Fawkes work at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; drawing column-breaks and decorative illustrations. He signed the drawings as Trog, which was short for Troglodyte which came from his days from World War II. He once joked that due to the amount of time spent in underground air-raid shelters people in London were becoming troglodytes. Fawkes was later inspired by this to adopt &quot;Trog&quot; as his pen-name. 

In 1949, Fawkes&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Flook&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and was a success. It featured the unlikely and satirical adventures of its small and furry eponymous hero. Fawkes&#x27;s role on the &quot;Mail&quot; was chiefly as illustrator, and he had a strong team of collaborators on the scripts for &quot;Flook&quot; over the years, including George Melly, Barry Norman, Humphrey Lyttelton and Barry Took. &quot;Flook&quot; ran for 35 years in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; until its sudden cancellation in 1984. Margaret Thatcher once said that it was &quot;quite the best commentary of the politics of the day&quot;. When the news broke that Fawkes was leaving the &quot;Mail&quot; he was signed up by Robert Maxwell, who in July 1984 had bought the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, from where Fawkes took &quot;Flook&quot;. It then transferred briefly to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; before being dropped completely.

Fawkes also produced political cartoons for &quot;The Spectator&quot; with George Melly as his author. The two also contributed occasionally to &quot;Private Eye&quot; and, beginning in 1962, to the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Despite producing larger political cartoons for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, his future role as Illingworth&#x27;s successor as lead cartoonist was threatened by the paper&#x27;s preference for the work of Gerald Scarfe. Fawkes therefore began submitting work to other publications, and he began contributing political cartoons to &quot;The Observer&quot;. At &quot;The Observer&quot; he fell foul of the readership when readers complained that some of his cartoons about the British royalty were &quot;grossly discourteous to the Queen&quot;. In 1967 Scarfe left the &quot;Mail&quot; and Fawkes&#x27; position at the paper became more secure, and in 1968 he stopped writing for &quot;The Observer&quot; to focus solely on the &quot;Mail&quot;.

Fawkes became the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s political cartoonist when Illingworth retired in 1969. That year he also replaced Illingworth as political cartoonist of &quot;Punch&quot;. In 1971, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; absorbed the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, and the role of transforming the old paper from a broadsheet into a tabloid fell to the old &quot;Sketch&quot; editor Sir David English, who gave the role of political cartoonist to Stan McMurtry and Fawkes was dropped from his old role. Fawkes returned to &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1971 and continued to work for &quot;Punch&quot;. After &quot;Flook&quot; was cancelled in 1985, Fawkes worked briefly for &quot;Today&quot; and then served a short stint at the &quot;London Daily News&quot;. During the 1980s he continued to contribute to &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and for &quot;The Observer&quot; he drew a pocket cartoon named &quot;mini-Trog&quot;. In 1996 he left &quot;The Observer&quot; and joined &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, where he remained until failing eyesight forced him to retire in 2005.

In 2013 his work was celebrated with an exhibition at the Cartoon Museum of London.

==Personal life==
In 1949 Fawkes married the journalist Sandy Fawkes, who later became known for surviving an affair with the American serial killer Paul John Knowles. They had four children together, one of whom died of SIDS. In 1965, he married Susan Clifford – daughter of the Australian composer Hubert Clifford – and they had two children.

Fawkes died in London on 1 March 2023, at age 98, following a short illness.

<text>Lund Cathedral () is a cathedral of the Lutheran Church of Sweden in Lund, Scania, Sweden. It is the seat of the Bishop of Lund and the main church of the Diocese of Lund. It was built as the Catholic cathedral of the archiepiscopal see of all the Nordic countries, dedicated to Saint Lawrence. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.

Lund Cathedral has been called &quot;the most powerful representative of Romanesque architecture in the Nordic countries.&quot; At the time of its construction, Lund and the cathedral belonged to Denmark. The main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the Rhine Valley. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called &quot;The giant Finn and his wife&quot; about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of Adam van Düren. Following the Reformation, the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony acknowledging the founding of Lund University in 1668. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently, much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by Carl Georg Brunius and later by architect Helgo Zettervall and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes implemented during the 19th century were extensive; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.

The medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and works of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains Gothic choir stalls, bronzes and an astronomical clock from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van Düren&#x27;s renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated pulpit. Of more recent date is the large mosaic in the apse, by Joakim Skovgaard, installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six church organs, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.

==Historical background==
Christian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the Christianisation of Denmark, and vied for influence over the kingdom. Denmark eventually became part of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen. Lund was at the time part of Denmark. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark. An episcopal see was created in Lund in 1060. At the same time, another see was created in Dalby, close to Lund, where Dalby Church was built adjacent to what was possibly a royal palace. However, when the first bishop of Lund (Henry of Lund) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, Egino, was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see overseeing all Nordic countries.

The cathedral was not the first church to be built in Lund; the earliest churches (now vanished) were built in the city at the end of the 10th century. Some kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there. Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden. During the Middle Ages, the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only Liberiet, which at one point served as a library, survives.

==History==
===Foundation and construction===
The earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to Saint Lawrence – the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages – dates from 1085. Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence. During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate. Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century. Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral. The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have prompted the change of plans.

Apart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any Romanesque churches. Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the illuminated manuscripts &quot;Necrologium Lundense&quot; and &quot;Liber daticus vetustior&quot;, are still preserved in the library of Lund University. Both books contain notes, written in Latin, with dates of the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large crypt. Its main altar was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars of the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin to be used. One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where baptisms were conducted. The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Lawrence on 1 September 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, Eskil, in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden. By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.

Unusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus. The name appears in both the &quot;Necrologium Lundense&quot; (as &quot;Donatus architectus&quot;) and the &quot;Liber daticus vetustior&quot;. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role. The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar. The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in Lombardy, conveyed via the Rhine Valley. Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy. Speyer Cathedral in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of Emperor Henry IV. Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and Mainz Cathedral, and the design of the apse is similar to that of the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio (Milan), Modena Cathedral and several churches in Pavia, all in northern Italy. Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, for example in Ribe Cathedral.

The building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking. Comparable but somewhat later workshops at Cologne Cathedral and Uppsala Cathedral employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively. The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe to Scandinavia. The stone sculptors , and Majestatis were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site. Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of present-day Denmark and Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably Vä Church (Scania). Other examples are e.g. (Zealand), (Småland), (Östergötland) and Havdhem Church (Gotland).

===Fire and repairs===
The plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was similar to the one seen today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later. The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with vaults, but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed. The cathedral was adorned with wall paintings and almost certainly by stained glass windows, but none of these remain. In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire. Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs. Even so, the need for repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century. Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by brick vaults. Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building. A conflict erupted between King Christopher I of Denmark and Archbishop Jakob Erlandsen in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church. Two chapels were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost bays of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a western extension of the south transept. Buttresses were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 tonne church bell.

===Changes by Adam van Düren and later===

The German sculptor and builder Adam van Düren apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between 1506 or 1507 and 1524. Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration. Adam van Düren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a well, which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with satirical allegories. The workshop of van Düren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the gable of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with pointed arches were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept. The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512–18 and again in 1527. It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van Düren.

Following the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues. The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent wars between Denmark and Sweden; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van Düren&#x27;s repairs, the church was described as being &quot;very dilapidated&quot; in 1682. During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised morgue where corpses were occasionally left for several years. Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected. Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to the condition of the building. King Gustav III of Sweden visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state. In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.

===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===

When the congregation wanted to build a new church organ in the early 19th century, architect was invited to examine the structure in 1832. Nyström recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral. The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, Carl Georg Brunius, was called to execute the plans of Nyström, and he did so while at the same time making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral. Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system. He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade. Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect Helgo Zettervall was appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860. A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately managed to implement most of his ideas for the cathedral. A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect Ferdinand Meldahl would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project. In 1862, Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund. In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a &quot;reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction&quot;. The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the crossing. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.

The proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome. This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades to rebuild the cathedral largely in line with his design from 1864.

Between 1832 and 1893, the cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own Neo-Romanesque designs.

In the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral. The building also underwent a major restoration in 1954–1963, led by architect . During this time the decorative painting from the 19th century was removed. The large mosaic decorating the apse was installed in 1927, and designed by Joakim Skovgaard. In 1990, the layout of the choir was changed and the altar placed in the crossing. Pope Francis visited the cathedral on 31 October 2016 to observe the 499th anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation.

==Architecture and decoration==
Lund Cathedral has been called &quot;the most powerful representative of Romanesque architecture in the Nordic countries&quot;. It lies at some distance from any other buildings and dominates its surroundings. It consists of the two towers built by Zettervall, which flank the main entrance to the west. Behind them a nave with two aisles open up to a transept that is somewhat higher than the nave. A short flight of stairs thus connect the nave with the choir as well as with the crypt under the choir. The choir ends in an apse. Inside, the bays of the cathedral are supported by groin vaults. The number of bays in the aisles are the double of that in the nave. The arches that separate the nave from the aisles are supported by piers and pillars of alternating width. The crypt has over forty shallow groin vaults supported by pillars with cushion capitals. It is sparsely lit by low small windows and remains largely unchanged since 1123.

Seen from outside, the different elements of the building are clearly discernible as independent volumes, &quot;as if they could be taken apart and put together again&quot;. The apse of the cathedral is a &quot;forcefully articulated&quot; semi-circle. Compared to its predecessors in Mainz, its composition is somewhat more elaborate with three distinct storeys each divided into fields, the lower by lesenes and the middle by columns with decorated capitals. The uppermost part is a gallery of shallow barrel vaults carried by 21 smaller columns, which open towards the exterior. The apse is the most well-preserved part of the Romanesque building and has been described as &quot;the artistic high point of the exterior&quot;. The southern portal of the nave is perhaps the oldest of the cathedral. Five decorated archivolts supported by small columns with variously decorated capitals, frame a tympanon depicting the Lamb of God. The northern portal is slightly later and more richly decorated. Its tympanon depicts Samson wrestling with the lion. Two bronze doors built by serve as the main entrance in the centre of the west facade. They have 24 reliefs with subjects from the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. Above the doorway, the tympanon depicts Christ, Canute IV of Denmark and Saint Lawrence. The cathedral has two sacristies. The building material of the cathedral is mostly sandstone quarried in the area around Höör. The main walls are constructed as shells of sandstone filled with fieldstone mixed with lime mortar. The thickness of the walls is around .

===Sculptures===
When it comes to stone sculpture, Lund Cathedral was the most lavishly decorated Romanesque building to be built in the Nordic countries, according to art historian Jan Svanberg, and its sculptures are of recognised high artistic quality. Perhaps the most well-known and striking of these are the sculptures of two figures traditionally called &quot;The giant Finn and his wife&quot; in the crypt. According to a local legend, the giant helped build the cathedral, and when he was not paid for his services he tried to destroy it by shaking the pillars, but was petrified. The larger of the two figures is embracing a column, while the smaller is attached to another column with a rope. These sculptures have probably been the subject of more attempts at an explanation than any other medieval artworks in Sweden, according to art historian Mereth Lindgren. Most scholars today believe the larger sculpture depicts Samson, but what the smaller figure is supposed to represent is not known. The sculptures date from the construction of the crypt but have been treated poorly, especially during the 18th century, and lost much of their original detailing.

The fluted columns also found in the crypt are similar in style to English Norman architecture and may indicate that the very first artistic influences came from the area bordering the English Channel. Apart from these columns however, the rich stone ornamentation is clearly in style, meaning related to north Italian art of the period. Among these is a baldachin now immured in the east wall of the north transept which may have been part of the original western facade; Its columns have Corinthian capitals and support a richly decorated archivolt on which traces of original paint survives. Opposite, in the south wall, is a smaller baldachin where the columns themselves are sculpted angels (one with feather tights) standing on lions. Similar sculptures exist in Como and Modena in northern Italy. In addition, the capitals of the columns in the church are all of high quality, and can be broadly divided into two groups displaying either Classical or Byzantine influences. Apart from its rich Romanesque decoration, Lund Cathedral also contains several late medieval sculptures made by Adam van Düren, as mentioned above. Several of these are of animals and contain inscriptions in Low German. A relief in the south transept displaying the Woman of the Apocalypse flanked by Saint Lawrence and Saint Canute is similar to the portal relief van Düren made a couple of years earlier at Glimmingehus.

===Altarpiece===

The medieval main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398 by Ide Pedersdatter Falk. The altarpiece is one of a group of stylistically similar altarpieces and made in some north Germany city, probably by Master Bertram or in his workshop. Its central panel depicts the Coronation of the Virgin, surrounded by two rows of 40 saints, 26 of which are original. Twelve figures have been taken from other medieval altarpieces, while two of the added figures are from the 17th century. The altarpiece is wide but is missing an original pair of wings.

===Choir stalls===

The choir contains two rows of medieval choir stalls made of Scanian oak wood, containing in total 78 seats. The wooden stalls date from the end of the 14th century, probably commissioned by archbishop Nils Jönson some time between 1361 and 1379. Clearly made by several different wood carvers, they are approximately tall without their gables and decorated with carved details. These are biblical scenes from both the Old and New Testament, but the stalls also contain misericords portraying animals and other small details. Their style is High Gothic and they are stylistically linked with contemporary art from the Rhine Valley. They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality. The choir stalls in Lund Cathedral also lent stylistic inspiration to the choir stalls in Roskilde Cathedral and St. Bendt&#x27;s Church, Ringsted.

Slightly older than the choir stalls is a bishop&#x27;s throne which survives in a damaged state and is placed in the south transept. It is somewhat similar in construction to the choir stalls but stylistically different and more closely related to contemporary art from north Germany. Currently placed next to the bishop&#x27;s chair is also a Gothic tabernacle in the form of a tall, decorated wooden pillar. It contains two cabinets surmounted by a statuette of a female saint and crowned by a hexagonal spire. The tabernacle was repaired by Brunius in the 19th century. The saint may be Ida of Toggenburg.

===Astronomical clock===
The astronomical clock of Lund Cathedral, presently located at the west end of the north aisle, dates from the late Middle Ages and was installed in Lund Cathedral 1425. In 1837, it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect and the Danish clockmaker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune &quot;In dulci jubilo&quot; and a procession of figures representing the three Kings with their servants parade across the face of the clock. Similar clocks from approximately the same period are known from several churches in towns in the south Baltic Sea area. Especially the clocks in Doberan Minster and St. Nicholas Church, Stralsund are very similar, and it is possible that the clockmaker Nikolaus Lilienfeld who made the clock in Stralsund also made the clock in Lund. The clock was repaired 2009–2010.

A decorated conventional clock from 1623 is immured on the opposite side of the nave, in the west wall of the south aisle.

===Bronzes===
The cathedral also owns three High Gothic bronze columns carrying statuettes, the oldest remaining furnishings in the cathedral, and a seven-branched candelabrum from the end of the Middle Ages. Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence&#x27;s column is approximately tall (and the saint ), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller. The three columns were probably made in Lübeck or Hamburg. Presently located in the south transept is also the tall seven-branched candelabrum or candle holder from the late 15th century, manufactured by Harmen Bonstede in Hamburg. It was supplied to the cathedral in a dismantled state, and traces of its assembly instruction are still discernible on the candelabrum. Similar candelabra were installed in a number of Scandinavian cathedrals at approximately the same time; although the one in Lund is larger than those in the cathedrals of Aarhus, Ribe, Viborg and Stockholm.

===Pulpit===
The current pulpit was commissioned at the end of the 16th century and is marked with the date 1592. The artist was Johannes Ganssog from Frankfurt an der Oder in present-day Germany. It is attached with unusual technical skill to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar. The building material is sandstone, black limestone and black and white marble, and it is partially painted and gilded. Reliefs of alabaster on the side show scenes from the New Testament.

===Graves and funerary monuments===

Several people have been buried in the cathedral. The crypt contains the oldest grave in the cathedral, the grave of Hermann of Schleswig, who played an important role as an emissary of archbishop Ascer of Lund to the Pope and who may have written parts of the aforementioned &quot;Necrologium Lundense&quot;. The simple Romanesque sarcophagus, which has an inscription in Latin and a depiction of the titular bishop, is located in the apse of the crypt. It dates from the middle of the 12th century. The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, , which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van Düren in 1512. The cathedral&#x27;s largest grave monument is that of bishop Hans Brostorp, who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the University of Copenhagen. The monument is made of limestone from Gotland and decorated in low relief.

The nave and the aisles contain several memorial plaques and epitaphs. Several commemorate bishops, such as (1699–1777) and Nils Hesslén (1728–1811). Many others were made for professors at Lund University, e.g. (1714–1796) and (1633–1697). The oldest epitaph of the cathedral commemorates the owner of Krageholm Castle (1500–1567) and his wife Görvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) (1509 or 1517 – 1605).

===Baptismal font===
The baptismal font of the cathedral is a sparsely decorated Early Gothic font from the 13th century made of reddish grey limestone from Gotland. It is a paradise font with its quatrefoil-shaped bowl and a round-arch frieze.

==Flora==

Several surveys and descriptions of the flora of the cathedral, like the plants that grow on its walls, have been made. The first to describe the flora of the cathedral was Daniel Rolander, one of the apostles of Linnaeus, who made a list of the vascular plants, mosses and lichens he found growing on the building in 1771. It was rediscovered in the 20th century and published in 1931. Elias Magnus Fries also made observations about the flora of the cathedral during the first half of the 19th century. A more systematic surveys of the flora of the building was published in 1922. Lichenologist Ove Almborn made a survey of the lichen of the cathedral in 1935; it was incidentally his first scientific publication. The lichens of the cathedral were inventoried again in 1993. Of the species observed growing on the cathedral, the minute fern wall-rue (&quot;Asplenium ruta-muraria&quot;) was mentioned as early as 1756 by and is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the cathedral flora. When the lichen flora was surveyed in 1993, 15 species were discovered. One of these, &quot;Lecanora perpruinosa&quot;, had not been observed in the province of Scania before.

==Relationship with Lund University==
The founding of Lund University in 1666 was acknowledged in a ceremony in the cathedral in 1668. Following the Reformation, the choir was used for a long time as a classroom, first by Lund Cathedral School and later by the university. The university also used the choir to store its library for some time. The cathedral is still the place for the ceremony of the of new doctor&#x27;s degrees at the university.

==Music==
The cathedral has five choirs for adults and two choirs for children. The cathedral is also frequently used for concerts.

There are currently six church organs in Lund Cathedral, including the largest church organ in Sweden. The gallery organ was built between 1932 and 1934 by the Danish company Marcussen &amp; Søn and renovated by the same company in 1992. It has 102 stops distributed between four manuals and a pedalboard. There are 7,074 pipes in total. The smallest organ is inside the astronomical clock, where it plays &quot;In dulci jubilo&quot;.

<doc id="618614" wikidata="Q7451050" url="?curid=618614" title="Sensitive compartmented information">
<text>Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) is a type of United States classified information concerning or derived from sensitive intelligence sources, methods, or analytical processes. All SCI must be handled within formal access control systems established by the Director of National Intelligence.

SCI is not a classification; SCI clearance has sometimes been called &quot;above Top Secret&quot;, but information at any classification level may exist within an SCI control system. When &quot;decompartmentalized&quot;, this information is treated the same as collateral information at the same classification level.

The federal government requires the SCI be processed, stored, used or discussed in a Sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF).

== Access ==
Eligibility for access to SCI is determined by a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or periodic reinvestigation. Because the same investigation is used to grant Top Secret security clearances, the two are often written together as TS//SCI. Eligibility alone does not confer access to any specific SCI material; it is simply a qualification. One must receive explicit permission to access an SCI control system or compartment. This process may include a polygraph or other approved investigative or adjudicative action.

Once it is determined a person should have access to an SCI compartment, they sign a nondisclosure agreement, are &quot;read in&quot; or indoctrinated, and the fact of this access is recorded in a local access register or in a computer database. Upon termination from a particular compartment, the employee again signs the nondisclosure agreement.

== Control systems ==
SCI is divided into control systems, which are further subdivided into compartments and sub-compartments. These systems and compartments are usually identified by a classified codeword. Several such codewords have been declassified. The following SCI control systems, with their abbreviations and compartments, are known:

; Special Intelligence (SI): Special Intelligence (so in the CAPCO manual, but always SI in document markings) is the control system covering communications intelligence. Special Intelligence is a term for communications intercepts. The previous title for this control system was COMINT, but this was deprecated in 2011. SI has several compartments, of which the following are known or declassified:SI-NK and SI-EU are also possible as in under ENDSEAL.Several now-retired codewords protected SI compartments based on their sensitivity, generally referred to as Top Secret Codeword (TSC) and Secret Codeword (SC). These codewords were: These three codewords, the usage of which was terminated in 1999, were attached directly to the classification without reference to COMINT or SI, e.g. Top Secret UMBRA.
; STELLARWIND (STLW): This codeword was revealed on June 27, 2013, when &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a draft report from the NSA Inspector General about the electronic surveillance program STELLARWIND. This program was started by President George W. Bush shortly after the 9/11 attacks. For information about this program, a new security compartment was created which was given STELLARWIND as its permanent cover term on October 31, 2001.
; ENDSEAL (EL): This U.S. Navy&#x27;s control system was revealed in the 2013 Classification Manual. ENDSEAL information must always be classified as Special Intelligence (SI), so probably it is related to SIGINT or ELINT. It has two subcompartments: ECRU (SI-EU) and NONBOOK (SI-NK).
; TALENT KEYHOLE (TK): TK covers space-based IMINT (imagery intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and MASINT (measurement and signature intelligence) collection platforms; related processing and analysis techniques; and research, design, and operation of these platforms (but see Reserve below). The original TALENT compartment was created in the mid-1950s for the U-2. In 1960, it was broadened to cover all national aerial reconnaissance (to later include SR-71 sourced imagery) and the KEYHOLE compartment was created for satellite intelligence. TALENT KEYHOLE is now a top-level control system that merged with KLONDIKE; KEYHOLE is no longer a distinct compartment. Known compartments include RUFF (IMINT satellites), ZARF (ELINT satellites), and CHESS (U-2). The KEYHOLE series KH-1 through KH-4b were part of the new TALENT-KEYHOLE designation. RSEN (Risk Sensitive Notice, portion marking RS) keyword is used for imagery product.
; HUMINT Control System (HCS): HCS is the HUMINT (human-source intelligence) Control System. This system was simply designated &quot;HUMINT&quot; until confusion arose between collateral (regular) HUMINT and the control system. The current nomenclature was chosen to eliminate the ambiguity. There are two compartments HCS-O (Operation) and HCS-P (Product). HCS-O-P marking was also used in &quot;Review of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden&quot;.
; KLONDIKE (KDK): KLONDIKE is a legacy system that protected sensitive geospatial intelligence. It had three main subcompartments: KDK BLUEFISH (KDK-BLFH, KDK-BLFH-xxxxxx, xxxxxx represents up to 6 alphanumeric characters indicating a sub BLUEFISH compartment), KDK IDITAROD (KDK-IDIT, KDK-IDIT-xxxxxx, xxxxxx represents up to 6 alphanumeric characters indicating a sub IDITAROD compartment) and KDK KANDIK (KDK-KAND, KDK-KAND-xxxxxx, xxxxxx represents up to 6 alphanumeric characters indicating a sub KANDIK compartment). Nowadays it exists under TALENT KEYHOLE (TK-BLFH, TK-IDIT, TK-KAND).
; RESERVE (RSV): RESERVE is the control system for National Reconnaissance Office compartments protecting new sources and methods during the research, development, and acquisition process. RSV-XXX, XXX represents 3 alphanumeric characters to indicate sub Reserve compartments.
; BYEMAN (BYE): BYEMAN is a retired control system covering certain overhead collection systems, including CORONA and OXCART. Most BYE content was transferred to TK. BYE Special Handling content was transferred to Reserve.

== Markings ==

SCI control system markings are placed immediately after the classification level markings in a banner line (banner spells out TOP SECRET in full) or portion marking (here TS is used). Sometimes, especially on older documents, they are stamped. The following banner line and portion marking describe a top secret document containing information from the notional SI-GAMMA 1234 subcompartment, the notional SI-MANSION compartment, and the notional TALENT KEYHOLE-BLUEFISH compartment (TK is always abbreviated, because in some cases even the full meaning may be classified, like for BUR keyword, BUR-BLG-HCAS, BUR-BLG-JETS):

Older documents were marked with HANDLE VIA xxxx CONTROL CHANNELS (or &quot;HVxCC&quot;), HANDLE VIA xxxx CHANNELS ONLY (or &quot;HVxCO&quot;), or HANDLE VIA xxxx CHANNELS JOINTLY (or &quot;HVxCJ&quot;), but this requirement was rescinded in 2006. For example, COMINT documents were marked as HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY. This marking led to the use of the caveat CCO (COMINT Channels Only) in portion markings, but CCO is also obsolete.

<doc id="618615" wikidata="Q856915" url="?curid=618615" title="Threading (epilation)">
<text>Threading is a method of hair removal originating in India and Iran. It has gained popularity in Western countries, especially with a cosmetic application (particularly for removing/shaping eyebrows).

==Technique==
In threading, a thin cotton or polyester thread is doubled, then twisted. It is then rolled over areas of unwanted hair, plucking the hair at the follicle level. Unlike tweezing, where single hairs are pulled out one at a time, threading can remove short rows of hair.

Advantages cited for eyebrow threading, as opposed to eyebrow waxing, include that it provides more precise control in shaping eyebrows, and that it is gentler on the skin. A disadvantage is that it can be painful, as several hairs are removed at once; however, it can be minimized if done correctly, i.e. with the right pressure.
There are different techniques for threading: the hand method, mouth method, and neck method. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages; however, the mouth method is the fastest and most precise.

Threading allows for a more defined and precise shape and can create better definition for eyebrows. It is also used as a method of removing unwanted hair on the entire face and upper lip area. Threading is not a good method for removing hair on arms or legs, as the hair in those regions is typically quite coarse and there is too much to remove.

== History ==
Eyebrow threading is a centuries-old technique that began in the Middle East and South Asia. In some countries, it signified rites of passages such as preparation for marriage.

Threading became popular in the United States beginning in the late 1980s, when immigrants from these countries began setting up threading studios in large American cities. It has increased in popularity since then. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in the United Kingdom, online searches for threading services increased by 50% in 2015.

<text>Kleo Pleyer (19 November 1898 – 26 March 1942) was a Nazi politician and academic. He was a historian and sociologist and a professor at the Königsberg Albertina University and Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen.

He was married to Luithgard Pleyer, who bore him seven children.

In 1939, he became a volunteer soldier for the Wehrmacht and eventually became an Oberleutnant. He was awarded the Iron Cross, first class and second class. He was killed in action while serving as his company&#x27;s commander at the Demyansk Pocket.

During his winter holidays in 1941–42, he wrote &quot;Volk im Feld&quot; (1943), or Nation at War. The book discussed the German campaigns in France and Russia. Pleyer not only justified the brutal treatment of prisoners of war, but called for the &quot;Ausrottung des Judentums&quot; (Extermination of Jewry). During the war, a large number of copies of the book were printed. The book was published posthumously, as Pleyer was killed fighting on the Eastern Front in 1942. Pleyer also wrote the lyrics of &quot;Kampflied der Nationalsozialisten&quot; (Combat Song of the National Socialists), the battle song of the Nazi Party, and the Leader of the Bündischen Front (BF).
In Königsberg, Pleyer was posthumously awarded the Kant-Prize.

<text>AlliedSignal, Inc. was an American aerospace, automotive and engineering company, created through the 1985 merger of Allied Corp. and The Signal Companies. It purchased Honeywell for $14.8 billion in 1999, and adopted the Honeywell name and identity.

AlliedSignal was a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1985 until February 19, 2008.

==History==
The Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation originated with the 1920 merger of five chemical companies: Barrett Paving Materials (est. 1852), General Chemical Company (est. 1899), National Aniline &amp; Chemical Company (est. 1917), Semet-Solvay Company (est. 1895), and the Solvay Process Company (est. 1881). The consolidation occurred with the backing of chemist William Nichols, who became concerned about dependence on the German chemical industry during World War I, and financier Eugene Meyer. It acquired the Eltra Corporation in 1979.

The company renamed itself the Allied Chemical Corporation in 1958, then simply the Allied Corp. in 1981. Allied merged with the Bendix Corporation in 1983, beginning the company&#x27;s involvement in aerospace.

The Signal Companies traced their history to the Signal Gasoline Company, founded by Samuel B. Mosher in 1922. It renamed itself to Signal Gas &amp; Oil in 1928 to reflect its expanding businesses. By the 1950s, Signal was the largest independent oil company on the West Coast of the United States and Mosher held large stakes in American President Lines and the Flying Tiger Line. In 1964, Signal merged with the Garrett Corporation, an aerospace company. In 1967, they purchased Mack Truck for $85m US. The combined company adopted &quot;The Signal Companies&quot; as its corporate name in 1968, and in 1974, sold its original Oil operations to Burmah Oil for $480m.

The merger of Allied and Signal made aerospace the new company&#x27;s largest business sector. The combined company adopted the name Allied-Signal on September 19, 1985. It dropped the hyphen to become AlliedSignal in 1993 to reinforce a one-company image and signify the full integration of all of its businesses. Between 1992 and 1997, the company radically reduced the number of suppliers from whom parts and materials were purchased, downsizing its supply base from 10,000 to 2000, particularly by eliminating poorer performing suppliers and training those who remained.

On June 7, 1999, AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell for $14.8 billion and adopted the latter&#x27;s more recognizable name.

==Product range==
Before the merger, Honeywell was an international controls company that developed and supplied advanced technology products, systems and services to aviation and space companies and industry. The product lines of the two companies were complementary, the only principal overlap being avionics.

<doc id="618628" wikidata="Q1170622" url="?curid=618628" title="Trog">
<text>Trog is a 1970 British science fiction horror film directed by Freddie Francis and starring Joan Crawford, Michael Gough and Bernard Kay. The screenplay was by Peter Bryan, John Gilling and Aben Kandel.

The film concerns the discovery of a troglodyte (or Ice Age &quot;caveman&quot;) in twentieth-century United Kingdom. &quot;Trog&quot; marks Crawford&#x27;s last movie appearance.

==Plot==
Set in contemporary Britain, the film follows Dr. Brockton, a renowned anthropologist who learns that in the caves of the countryside a lone male troglodyte is alive and might be able to be helped and even domesticated. In the interest of science and the potential groundbreaking discovery of the , she gets the creature to the surface. While the rest of the townsfolk and police scatter in terror, Brockton stands steady with her tranquilizer gun and stuns the caveman into submission.

She brings him back to her lab for study, but runs into trouble as a few people oppose the presence of a &quot;monster&quot; in the town, especially Sam Murdock, a local businessman who is not only afraid of the negative commercial consequences but is also suspicious of a woman heading a research facility. In the meantime, the creature, given the name of &quot;Trog&quot;, is taught by Brockton to play and share. A capacity for language is induced by a number of surgeries and a mysterious hypnotic device that causes Trog to see or relive his distant past, including clashes between various animals.

Still disturbed by Brockton&#x27;s experiments, and enraged at a municipal court&#x27;s decision to protect Trog, Murdock releases Trog in the middle of the night, hoping the caveman will be confronted and killed by either local residents or well-armed authorities. After being released, Trog wanders into town and kills the first three people he meets, a grocer, a butcher, and a citizen in a car, but not before he beats Murdock to death.

Trog then snatches a little girl from a playground and takes her to his cave. Dr. Brockton, the police, and army personnel soon gather at the cave&#x27;s entrance. After pleading fruitlessly with the authorities to let her reason with Trog and safely retrieve the girl, Brockton suddenly acts on her own and charges down into the cave, where she finds the girl cowering in a corner. Trog initially behaves aggressively at the sight of the doctor in his refuge, but after a stern reprimand and a plea by Brockton, Trog surrenders the girl to her.

Shortly after the doctor and girl exit the cave, all of Brockton&#x27;s work on behalf of science is shattered when soldiers ignite explosives before assaulting the cave. Trog is quickly wounded in a barrage of gunfire, falls, and is impaled on a stalagmite. The film ends with an on-site news reporter asking the doctor to comment on the death of the missing link; Brockton pushes aside the reporter&#x27;s microphone and slowly walks away from the scene by herself.

==Cast==
==Production==
Based on an original story by Peter Biyan and John Gilling, the film was initially developed by Tony Tenser at Tigon Films, which sold the project to producer Herman Cohen. In July 1968, Cohen announced he had signed a contract with Warner Bros-Seven Arts to produce &quot;Crooks and Coronets&quot; and &quot;Trog&quot;, with the latter to begin filming in September.

Filming was delayed for several months, until after Joan Crawford agreed to star in the production in May 1969. &quot;Trog&quot; was the second of two films that she starred in for Cohen, the first being &quot;Berserk!&quot; in 1967. It also paired her again with Michael Gough, who costarred with Crawford in that earlier film. Crawford&#x27;s character in the original script had been a man but Cohen rewrote it specifically for Crawford.

The director Freddie Francis later commented on the benefits and challenges that he experienced working on the film:

===Filming===
Crawford described &quot;Trog&quot; as &quot;a low-budget picture&quot;, adding &quot;I supply most of my own wardrobe.&quot; Just weeks after she committed to performing in the project, the film began shooting on 30 June 1969. The production also features actor David Warbeck, who has a small role as Alan Davis.

In a 1992 interview with the horror-film fan magazine &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Cohen notes that &quot;Trog&quot;, which was shot at Bray Studios and on location on the English moors, was more expensive to produce than &quot;Berserk!&quot; Cohen in that same interview also recalls the problems he had with Crawford&#x27;s increased use of alcohol during filming:
The stop-motion dinosaur sequence in the film is stock footage originally produced by special-effects artists Willis O&#x27;Brien and Ray Harryhausen and used in the 1956 Warner Bros. nature documentary &quot;The Animal World&quot;. Also, according to Turner Classic Movies, the &quot;ratty ape-suit&quot; used to create Trog&#x27;s caveman appearance was a &quot;leftover monkey outfit&quot; from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s epic 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

Freddie Francis later referred to &quot;Trog&quot; as &quot;a terrible film&quot; and as one he regretted directing:

Joe Cornelius, who plays the feature&#x27;s title character, provides a quite different perspective on Crawford&#x27;s actions and demeanor during filming. As a professional wrestler in England, Cornelius performed in the ring for 20 years as &quot;The Dazzler&quot; and was chosen to portray Trog due to his physique and athletic abilities.

Cornelius&#x27; role provided him with numerous opportunities to observe Crawford both on and off camera. Forty-five years after the film&#x27;s release, in an interview arranged and video-recorded by the British Film Institute (BFI), he shared publicly for the first time his experiences working on the production and more specifically with the veteran actress. That interview occurred in September 2015, just prior to a screening of &quot;Trog&quot; by BFI in one of its film retrospectives. It was conducted by the American director and writer John Waters, a notable promoter and creator of underground or &quot;transgressive cult films&quot;, as well as a fan of many other types of low-budget, more mainstream productions like &quot;Trog&quot;.

In his interview with Waters, Cornelius takes exception to reports that Crawford used &quot;idiot cards&quot; and was periodically drunk during filming. The former wrestler says he saw no use of such cards by her, and he described Crawford as &quot;great&quot; to work with, consistently on time and &quot;lovely&quot; on the set, as generous in giving gifts to the crew, and how for years after completing &quot;Trog&quot; she sent him a personal card every Christmas. While he concedes that Crawford &quot;possibly&quot; had vodka in her Pepsi-Cola container, he stated that he never saw her drunk or unable to perform for any reason during the film&#x27;s production.

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Aben Kandel&#x27;s script has played down the horror to concentrate on the dramatic possibilities of the monster&#x27;s humanisation. The result is a kind of horror-comic &quot;L&#x27;Enfant Sauvage&quot;, with Joan Crawford&#x27;s lady anthropologist patiently initiating her uncouth pupil in the ways of classical music (it doesn&#x27;t like jazz), clockwork toys, and finally human speech. Although credulity is tested by the fact that Trog never looks like anything but a beefy stunt man with make-up ... the makers have taken pains to win us round by presenting all the newsmen as nasty sceptics whose agnostic mutterings (&quot;Surely, doctor, this is all too simple&quot;) wilt before Joan Crawford&#x27;s radiant cry of &quot;Anthropology supports me&quot;. ... It&#x27;s a disappointingly lightweight addition to the horror films of Freddie Francis.&quot;

Recalling his work on the film in 1992, Cohen noted that the film was completed on time, came in under budget, and was in his opinion &quot;very successful&quot;. Many 1970 reviews of the film, however, were not favorable. In September that year, after previewing &quot;Trog&quot;, critic Roger Ebert begins his assessment of the film with a question:

In October 1970, only a few days after the film&#x27;s nationwide release in the United States, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s review at least offers two faintly positive observations about Crawford&#x27;s involvement in the low-budget production:

In the decades since its premiere, &quot;Trog&quot; has achieved a near cult status among some movie fans, especially those who enjoy watching low-budget horror and sci-fi productions for their outlandish plots or for their sheer campiness, that a particular film is &quot;&#x27;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x27;&quot;. The British Film Institute in the promotion of its 2015 retrospective program on &quot;Trog&quot; provided attendees with an updated or more current take on the film&#x27;s appeal:
Warner Bros., the film&#x27;s distributor in 1970, also chose &quot;mind-boggling&quot; to describe &quot;Trog&quot; during the company&#x27;s &quot;31 Days of Horror&quot; promotion to sell copies of it in October 2015. In part of that promotion leading up to Halloween, Warner Bros. assures &quot;campy cult fans&quot; they will &quot;delight&quot; in the film and that both the troglodyte&#x27;s makeup and &quot;Crawford&#x27;s boldly colored pantsuits&quot; are &quot;hilariously bad&quot;.

The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made&quot;. In 2012, several years before his previously described BFI interview with Joe Cornelius, John Waters recognized &quot;Trog&quot; as one of his favorite films on the streaming service MUBI.

The film was released as a double-bill with Christopher Lee&#x27;s &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; and after its first week in release, &quot;Variety&quot; on November 4, 1970 ranked the double-feature as the #1 top-grossing film(s) of the week, raking in $300,000.

==Releases==
The film was released theatrically in both the United States and United Kingdom by Warner Bros. in 1970. Warner Home Video began marketing VHS copies of &quot;Trog&quot; in 1995 and in DVD format in 2007.

<text>Admiral Firmus Piett is a fictional character from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, first introduced and portrayed by Kenneth Colley in the 1980 film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. As a supporting villain in command of Darth Vader&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Executor&quot;, Piett is generally considered to be the most prominent Imperial officer in the film. He subsequently appeared in the sequel &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, making him the only officer in the original trilogy to appear in more than one film and be portrayed by the same actor. Piett also appears in the canon &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel &quot;Lost Stars&quot;, and is featured in several more novels, comic books, and video games within the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; line.

==Character==

===Development===
Piett was a creation of George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Kasdan was aware that there was fun to be had in giving more depth and variability to his background characters, not only to help viewers identify them, but to remind his audience that much of the Empire consisted of people just doing their jobs. Although Admiral Piett&#x27;s true first appearance in the Star Wars universe was one month prior to the release of the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; in the film&#x27;s novelization, he was brought to life to audiences around the world by British actor Kenneth Colley, who was cast in the role. Colley recalls that &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; director Irvin Kershner stated that for Piett, he was &quot;looking for someone that would frighten Adolf Hitler&quot;, and told Colley after meeting him, &quot;Yes, I think you&#x27;re it&quot;. In playing the role, Colley chose not to portray a singular attitude for the character; but instead attempted to bring forth a more true to life humanity in Piett&#x27;s character, something that he believes ultimately sat quite well with audiences.

== Appearances ==
=== Film ===

==== &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; ====
Piett serves in the Galactic Empire as first officer and captain of the Super Star Destroyer, &quot;Executor&quot;, Darth Vader&#x27;s flagship. While in search of the Rebel base, under the command of Admiral Ozzel, Piett receives a suspicious transmission from an Imperial probe droid located in the Hoth system. Although dismissed and ignored by Admiral Ozzel who wants proof, not leads, Piett supersedes his superior and informs Vader of the transmission; which in fact does turn out to be the hidden Rebel Alliance headquarters, Echo Base. Vader then dispatches the Imperial fleet to Hoth; however, Ozzel orders the fleet to exit hyperspace too close to the planet, enabling them to be detected by the Rebels, who raise an energy shield to stop any orbital bombardment. Ozzel is quickly executed by Vader for his incompetence. Vader then promotes Piett to Admiral, giving him full command of the Destroyer.

After the Battle of Hoth, Piett is tasked with the pursuit of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, which has escaped into a nearby asteroid field. Piett informs Vader of this, whilst Vader is in his meditation chamber aboard the &quot;Executor&quot;; in doing so, Piett becomes the first onscreen character to see Vader without his helmet. Vader at first ignores Piett&#x27;s concern over venturing into the field, but later commands the admiral to move the ship away from the asteroids, in order to gain a clear signal for Vader&#x27;s communication with Emperor Palpatine. Vader subsequently hires bounty hunters to assist in the capture of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, a decision which Piett appears to disdain. With the &quot;Falcon&quot; continuing to evade capture, Vader executes Star Destroyer &quot;Avenger&quot; captain Lorth Needa, conveying his displeasure as an ominous warning to Piett.

With bounty hunter Boba Fett tracking the &quot;Falcon&quot; to Cloud City on Bespin, Piett has his engineers deactivate the hyperdrive on the ship. Later attempting to escape, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, and those within it, are nearly captured when Piett orders the activation of the Executor&#x27;s tractor beam. However, the &quot;Falcon&quot; unexpectedly jumps to light-speed and evades capture, as R2-D2 is able to reactivate the hyperdrive. Despite his failure, a visibly terrified Piett finds his life uncharacteristically spared by Vader at the end of the film.

====&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;====
In the following film, Admiral Piett is in command of the Imperial fleet at the Battle of Endor, still aboard the &quot;Executor&quot;. He first appears in the film when a covert team of Rebels, led by Han Solo aboard the stolen Imperial shuttle, &quot;Tydirium&quot;, attempt to transmit an older valid security code, to allow them shield access and entry to the forest moon of Endor. Piett is then interrupted by Vader, who informs Piett that he will deal with the shuttle personally.

During the Rebel attack on the second Death Star, Piett receives orders from Emperor Palpatine himself to hold position and keep the Rebels from escaping from the Death Star&#x27;s fully operational superlaser. The plan is disrupted when the Rebels are ordered by Admiral Ackbar to attack the Star Destroyers at point-blank range, concentrating their fire on the &quot;Executor&quot;. After the Rebel fleet knocks out the shields protecting the bridge, Piett commands his men to increase firepower to keep anything from getting through. A disabled A-wing fighter then makes a kamikaze maneuver into the &quot;Executor&quot; bridge, with Piett and Commander Gherant diving into the lower command deck. The incapacitated Destroyer then plunges into the Death Star, exploding in a plume of flame, as Piett meets his demise.

=== Novels ===
As stated in the 2015 &quot;Ultimate Star Wars&quot; reference book, Piett was born on the Outer Rim world of Axxila, and is confirmed to have the first name Firmus within the new canon. Piett later joins the Imperial Starfleet, and appears in the novel &quot;Lost Stars&quot;, set eight years after the Clone Wars, under the command of Grand Moff Tarkin at an Imperial annexation on the planet Jelucan.

=== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ===
Piett has appeared in many novels, comics and video games, now considered to be non-Disney &quot;canon&quot; and part of &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;. He is given a much deeper backstory in these various media; As a young lieutenant, Piett impresses Vader with his skill and loyalty, and the Sith lord soon promotes him to captain of the Star Destroyer &quot;Accuser&quot; and makes him a member of the Empire&#x27;s &quot;Death Squadron&quot;. Winning widespread respect for his survival after the events of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Piett also participates in the Battle of Mygeeto, before the events leading to his death in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

==Reception==

Over time, the character has become a favorite amongst fans, due to his unusual longevity. According to Colley, the character of Piett was not originally slated to appear in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, but George Lucas added him because Lucasfilm had received &quot;a lot of fan mail&quot; about the character.

<doc id="618631" wikidata="Q852163" url="?curid=618631" title="Low back pain">
<text>Low back pain or is a common disorder involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back, in between the lower edge of the ribs and the lower fold of the buttocks. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start, with 40–90% of people recovered by six weeks.
In most episodes of low back pain a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by &quot;red flags&quot; such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful or recommended for low back pain that lasts less than 6 weeks (with no red flags) and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events. Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition that not only affects the body, but also a person&#x27;s social and economic status. It would be greatly beneficial for people with CNSLBP to be screened for genetic issues, unhealthy lifestyles and habits, and psychosocial factors on top of musculoskeletal issues. Chronic lower back pain is defined as back pain that lasts more than three months.
The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start, with 40–90% of people recovered by six weeks. Normal activity should be continued as much as the pain allows. Initial management with non-medication based treatments is recommended. Non–medication based treatments include superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation. If these are not sufficiently effective, NSAIDs are recommended. A number of other options are available for those who do not improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects, including high rates of addiction, accidental overdose and death. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit of surgery has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.
Approximately 9–12% of people (632 million) have low back pain at any given point in time, and nearly 25% report having it at some point over any one-month period. About 40% of people have low back pain at some point in their lives, with estimates as high as 80% among people in the developed world. Low back pain is the greatest contributor to lost productivity, absenteeism, disability and early retirement worldwide. Difficulty with low back pain most often begins between 20 and 40 years of age. Women and older people have higher estimated rates of lower back pain and also higher disability estimates. Low back pain is more common among people aged between 40 and 80 years, with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages. According to the World Health Organizations, lower back pain is the top medical condition world-wide from which the most number of people world-wide can benefit from improved rehabilitation.

==Signs and symptoms==
In the common presentation of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start soon after the movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point, to diffuse pain. It may or may not worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person&#x27;s first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.

Other problems may occur along with low back pain. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep, disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.

==Causes==

Low back pain is not a specific disease but rather a complaint that may be caused by a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of low back pain does not have a clear cause but is believed to be the result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. There is no consensus as to whether spinal posture or certain physical activities are causal factors. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.

Women may have acute low back pain from medical conditions affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the low back during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.

Low back pain can be broadly classified into four main categories:
*Musculoskeletal – mechanical (including muscle strain, muscle spasm, or osteoarthritis); herniated nucleus pulposus, herniated disc; spinal stenosis; or compression fracture
*Inflammatory – HLA-B27 associated arthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammation within the reproductive system, and inflammatory bowel disease
*Malignancy – bone metastasis from lung, breast, prostate, thyroid, among others
*Infectious – osteomyelitis, abscess, urinary tract infection.

==Pathophysiology==

===Back structures===
The lumbar (or lower back) region is the area between the lower ribs and gluteal fold which includes five lumbar vertebrae (L1–L5) and the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together while at the same time protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, receiving sensory input and sending messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.

The multifidus muscles run up and down along the back of the spine, and are important for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.

An intervertebral disc has a gelatinous core surrounded by a fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run to the outside of the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.

===Pain sensation===
Pain erupts in response to a stimulus that either damages or can potentially damage the body&#x27;s tissues. There are four main stages: transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation. The nerve cells that detect pain have cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia and fibers that transmit these signals to the spinal cord. The process of pain sensation starts when the pain-causing event triggers the endings of appropriate sensory nerve cells. This type of cell converts the event into an electrical signal by transduction. Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the transducing cell to the posterior horn of spinal cord, from there to the brain stem, and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the thalamus and the limbic system. In the brain, the pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain perception. Through modulation, the brain can modify the sending of further nerve impulses by decreasing or increasing the release of neurotransmitters.

Parts of the pain sensation and processing system may not function properly; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much pain from a particular cause, or signaling pain from a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain.

==Diagnosis==
As the structure of the low back is complex, the reporting of pain is subjective, and is affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others. The ICD 10 code for low back pain is M54.5.

===Classification===
There are a number of ways to classify low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.

Low back pain may be classified based on the signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as &quot;nonspecific&quot;, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is &quot;radicular&quot;, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as &quot;needing urgent or specialized attention&quot;.

The symptoms can also be classified by duration as acute, sub-chronic (also known as sub-acute), or chronic. The specific duration required to meet each of these is not universally agreed upon, but generally pain lasting less than six weeks is classified as &quot;acute&quot;, pain lasting six to twelve weeks is &quot;sub-chronic&quot;, and more than twelve weeks is &quot;chronic&quot;. Management and prognosis may change based on the duration of symptoms.

===Red flags===

The presence of certain signs, termed &quot;red flags&quot;, indicate the need for further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The presence of a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.

The usefulness of many red flags is poorly supported by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma especially if it results in skin markings. The best determinant of the presence of cancer is a history of the same.

With other causes ruled out, people with non-specific low back pain are typically treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the cause. Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis, such as depression, substance abuse, or an agenda concerning insurance payments may be helpful.

===Tests===
Imaging is indicated when there are red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation, and lumbar provocative discography may be useful to identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can also be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroiliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.

Complaints of low back pain are one of the most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person&#x27;s medical history and physical examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one&#x27;s health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.

==Prevention==
Exercise is recommended when experiencing non-specific lower back pain (LBP). The most effective way to decrease pain intensity is by focusing on trunk, pelvic, and leg stretching. Relaxation and postural exercise are not effective in reducing the pain intensity.

Exercise alone, or along with education, appears to be useful for preventing low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Assessing chronic low back pain, a 2007 review concluded that a firm mattress is less likely to alleviate pain compared to a medium-firm mattress, while a 2020 review stated that studies have been inadequate to comment on mattress firmness. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.

Studies have proven that interventions aimed to reduce pain and functional disability need to be accompanied by psychological interventions to improve a patient&#x27;s motivation and attitude toward their recovery. Education about an injury and how it can effect a person&#x27;s mental health is just as important as the physical rehabilitation. However, all of these interventions should occur in partnership with a structured therapeutic exercise program and assistance from a trained physical therapist. 

==Management==
Most people with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time no matter the treatment. There is often improvement within the first month. Although fear in those suffering from low back pain often leads to avoiding activity, this is found to lead to greater disability. The recommendations include remaining active, avoiding activity that worsen the pain, and understanding self-care of the symptoms. Management of low back pain depends on which of the three general categories is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities as soon as possible within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery.

For those with sub-chronic or chronic low back pain, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended Non–medication based treatments include superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation. If these are not sufficiently effective, NSAIDs are recommended. Acetaminophen and systemic steroids are not recommended as both medications are not effective at improving pain outcomes in acute or subacute low back pain.

Physical therapy stabilization exercises for lumbar spine and manual therapy have shown decrease in pain symptoms in patients. Manual therapy and stabilization effects have similar effects on low back pain which overweighs the effects of general exercises. The most effective types of exercise to improve low back pain symptoms are core strengthening and mixed exercise types. An appropriate type of exercise recommended is an aerobic exercise program for 12 hours of exercise over a duration of 8 weeks.

Distress due to low back pain contributes significantly to overall pain and disability experienced. Therefore, treatment strategies that aim to change beliefs and behaviours, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy can be of use.

Access to care as recommended in medical guidelines varies considerably from the care that most people with low back pain receive globally. This is due to factors such as availability, access and payment models (e.g. insurance, health-care systems).

===Physical management===
==== Management of acute low back pain ====
Increasing general physical activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability or returning to work has been found when used for the treatment of an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Aerobic exercises like progressive walking appears useful for subacute and acute low back pain, is strongly recommended for chronic low back pain, and is recommended after surgery. Directional exercises, which try to limit low back pain, are recommended in sub-acute, chronic and radicular low back pain. These exercises only work if they are limiting low back pain. Exercise programs that incorporate stretching only are not recommended for acute low back pain. Stretching, especially with limited range of motion, can impede future progression of treatment like limiting strength and limiting exercises. Yoga and Tai chi are not recommended in case of acute or subacute low back pain, but are recommended in case of chronic back pain.

Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended. Lumbar traction lacks effectiveness as an intervention for radicular low back pain. It is also unclear whether lumbar supports are an effective treatment intervention.

==== Management of chronic low back pain ====
Exercise therapy is effective in decreasing pain and improving physical function, trunk muscle strength and the mental health for those with chronic low back pain. It also improves long-term function and appears to reduce recurrence rates for as long as six months after the completion of the program. The observed treatment effect for the exercise when compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo, improved pain (low‐certainty evidence), but improvements were small for functional limitations outcomes (moderate‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another, so the form of exercise used can be based on patient or practitioner preference, availability and cost. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is some evidence to support small benefits from the use of yoga. If a person with chronic low back pain is motivated, it is recommended to use yoga and tai chi as a form of treatment, but this is not recommended to treat acute or subacute low back pain. Motor control exercise, which involves guided movement and use of normal muscles during simple tasks which then builds to more complex tasks, improves pain and function up to 20 weeks, but there was little difference compared to manual therapy and other forms of exercise. Motor control exercise accompanied by manual therapy also produces similar reductions in pain intensity when compared to general strength and condition exercise training, yet only the latter also improved muscle endurance and strength, whilst concurrently decreased self-reported disability. Aquatic therapy is recommended as an option in those with other preexisting conditions like extreme obesity, degenerative joint disease, or other conditions that limit progressive walking. Aquatic therapy is recommended for chronic and subacute low back pain in those with a preexisting condition. Aquatic therapy is not recommended for people that have no preexisting condition that limits their progressive walking. There is low-to-moderate quality evidence that supports pilates in low back pain for the reduction of pain and disability, however there is no conclusive evidence that pilates is better than any other form of exercise for low back pain.

Patients with chronic low back pain receiving multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs are likely to experience less pain and disability than those receiving usual care or a physical treatment. MBR also has a positive influence on work status of the patient compared to physical treatment. Effects are of a modest magnitude and should be balanced against the time and resource requirements of MBR programs.

Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. There has been little research that supports the use of lumbar extension machines and thus they are not recommended.

===Medications===
If initial management with non–medication based treatments is insufficient, medication may be recommended. As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality, and this can lead to decreased satisfaction.

The medication typically prescribed first are acetaminophen (paracetamol), NSAIDs (though not aspirin), or skeletal muscle relaxants and these are enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs is thought to be small, but is more effective than Acetaminophen (paracetamol), which may be no more effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs however, carry a greater risk of side effects, including kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems, so it is used at the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible time. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; there is no evidence to support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.

Systemic corticosteriods are sometimes suggested for low back pain and may have a small benefit in the short-term for radicular low back pain, however, the benefit for non-radicular back pain and the optimal dose and length of treatment is unclear.

As of 2022, the CDC has released a guideline for prescribed opioid use in the management of chronic pain. It states that opioid use is not the preferred treatment when managing chronic pain due to the excessive risks involved, including high risks of addiction, accidental overdose and death. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain. If the pain is not managed adequately, short-term use of opioids such as morphine may be suggested, although low back pain outcomes are poorer in the long-term. If prescribed, a person and their clinician should have a realistic plan to discontinue its use in the event that the risks outweigh the benefit. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have a greater risk of side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. Opioid treatment for chronic low back pain increases the risk for lifetime illicit drug use and the effect of long-term use of opioids for lower back pain is unknown. For older people with chronic pain, opioids may be used in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, including those with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. They may also be useful for a select group of people with neuropathic pain.

Antidepressants may be effective for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, but they have a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin, pregabalin, and topiramate are sometimes used for chronic low back pain evidence does not support a benefit. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to be effective in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long-term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.

===Surgery===
Surgery may be useful in those with a herniated disc that is causing significant pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. It may also be useful in those with spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery.

Discectomy (the partial removal of a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better outcomes at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown to result in a different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.

For those with pain localized to the lower back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although only a few of those who have spinal fusion experience good results, and there may be no clinically important difference between disk replacement and fusion surgery. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risk but provides no added improvement in pain or function. Spinal cord stimulation using implanted electrodes is not supported by evidence due to the potential risks and costs.

===Alternative medicine===
It is unclear if alternative treatments are useful for non-chronic back pain. Chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) appear similarly effective to other recommended treatments. National guidelines differ, with some not recommending SMT, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course for those who do not improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended SMT based on low-quality evidence. There is insufficient evidence to recommend manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation. SMT does not provide significant benefits compared to motor control exercises.

The evidence supporting acupuncture treatment for providing clinically beneficial acute and chronic pain relief is very weak. When compared to a &#x27;sham&#x27; treatment, no differences in pain relief or improvements in a person&#x27;s quality of life were found. There is very weak evidence that acupuncture may be better than no treatment at all for immediate relief. A 2012 systematic review reported the findings that for people with chronic pain, acupuncture may improve pain a little more than no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be an option for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications, however this depends on patient preference, the cost, and on how accessible acupuncture is for the person.

Massage therapy does not appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. Massage therapy has been found to be more effective for acute low back pain than no treatment; the benefits were found to be limited to the short term and there was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain, massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain. Massage therapy is recommended for selected people with subacute and chronic low back pain, but it should be paired with another form of treatment like aerobic or strength exercises. For acute or chronic radicular pain syndromes massage therapy is recommended only if low back pain is considered a symptom. Mechanical massage tools are not recommended for the treatment of any form of low back pain.

Prolotherapy – the practice of injecting solutions into joints (or other areas) to cause inflammation and thereby stimulate the body&#x27;s healing response – has not been found to be effective by itself, although it may be helpful when added to another therapy.

Herbal medicines, as a whole, are poorly supported by evidence. The herbal treatments Devil&#x27;s claw and white willow may reduce the number of individuals reporting high levels of pain; however, for those taking pain relievers, this difference is not significant. Capsicum, in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast, has been found to reduce pain and increase function.

Behavioral therapy may be useful for chronic pain. There are several types available, including operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual&#x27;s physiological response to pain. The benefit however is small. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it may be useful in improving the acceptance of existing pain.

Tentative evidence supports neuroreflexotherapy (NRT), in which small pieces of metal are placed just under the skin of the ear and back, for non-specific low back pain. Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR), targeting physical and psychological aspects, may improve back pain but evidence is limited. There is a lack of good quality evidence to support the use of radiofrequency denervation for pain relief.

KT Tape has been found to be no different for management of chronic non-specific low back pain than other established pain management strategies.

=== Education ===
There is strong evidence that education may improve low back pain, with a 2.5 hour educational session more effective than usual care for helping people return to work in the short- and long-term. This was more effective for people with acute rather than chronic back pain. The benefit of training for preventing back pain in people who work manually with materials or is not clear, however moderate quality evidence does not show a role in preventing back pain.

==Prognosis==
Overall, the outcome for acute low back pain is positive. Pain and disability usually improve a great deal in the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.

For persistent low back pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with improvement in the first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 times more likely to have poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell&#x27;s signs).

Prognosis may be influenced by expectations, with those having positive expectations of recovery related to higher likelihood of returning to work and overall outcomes.

==Epidemiology==
Low back pain that lasts at least one day and limits activity is a common complaint. Globally, about 40% of people have low back pain at some point in their lives, with estimates as high as 80% of people in the developed world. Approximately 9 to 12% of people (632 million) have low back pain at any given point in time, which was calculated to 7460 per 100,000 globally in 2020. Nearly one quarter (23.2%) report having it at some point over any one-month period. Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40 years of age. However, low back pain becomes increasingly common with age, and is most common in the age group of 85. Older adults more greatly affected by low back pain; they are more likely to lose mobility and independence and less likely to continue to participate in social and family activities.

Women have higher rates of low back pain than men within all age groups, and this difference becomes more marked in older age groups (above 75 years). In a 2012 review which found a higher rate in females than males, the reviewers thought this may be attributable to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy.

Although the majority of low back pain has no specific underlying cause, workplace ergonomics, smoking and obesity are associated with low back pain in approximately 30% of cases. Low levels of activity is also associated with low back pain. Workplace ergonomics associated with low back pain include lifting, bending, vibration and physically demanding work, as well as prolonged sitting, standing and awkward postures. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – are more likely to have low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.

The overall number of individuals affected expected to increase with population growth and as the population ages, with the largest increases expectedin low- and middle-income countries.

==History==

Low back pain has been with humans since at least the Bronze Age. The oldest known surgical treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates ( – ) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians through the end of the first millennium recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.

At the start of the 20th century, physicians thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.

Emerging technologies such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc as a source for back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging technologies such as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.

==Society and culture==
Low back pain results in large economic costs. In the United States, it is the most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany. In the United States, low back pain is highest of Years Lived With Disability (YLDs) rank, rate, and rercentage Change for the 25 leading causes of disability and injury, between 1990 and 2016.

Workers who experience acute low back pain as a result of a work injury may be asked by their employers to have x-rays. As in other cases, testing is not indicated unless red flags are present. An employer&#x27;s concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and should not be used to justify medical testing when it is not indicated. There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated.

==Research==
Total disc replacement is an experimental option, but no significant evidence supports its use over lumbar fusion. Researchers are investigating the possibility of growing new intervertebral structures through the use of injected human growth factors, implanted substances, cell therapy, and tissue engineering.

<text>The Golden Bridge connects Ankleshwar to Bharuch in the Gujarat state of western India. It was built in 1881 by the British, who needed a bridge across the Narmada River to create better access to trade and administration officials in Bombay (now called Mumbai). The bridge is also called the Narmada Bridge.

==Construction==
The British started construction on the iron bridge on 7 December 1877. The bridge was contracted by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway and was designed by Sir John Hawkshaw. The bridge was completed on 16 May 1881 at a cost of Rs 45.65 lakhs. Originally named the Narmada Bridge, it came to be known as the Golden Bridge on account of the heavy expenditure incurred during construction due to damage from heavy water flow. 

After independence, it became part of the national highway. However, the flow of heavy traffic was reduced after a new bridge on Narmada was built. 

The length of the Golden Bridge is .

=== Impact of 2023 Bharuch Flood ===
In September 2023, the Golden Bridge experienced significant challenges due to severe flooding in Bharuch. The flood was caused by continuous heavy rainfall and the release of water from the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River. The water level of the Narmada River near the Golden Bridge reached about 9 feet above the danger mark, leading to the evacuation of over 2,000 people and around 500 cattle to relief camps. The bridge was temporarily closed to traffic due to waterlogging and safety concerns. The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were deployed in the area for rescue operations.

<text>Aurora Gory Alice is the first studio album by Letters to Cleo. It was released in 1993 on CherryDisc Records and re-released in 1994 on Giant Records. The first single from the album was &quot;I See,&quot; which got little exposure (although it was later used as the music that plays during the closing credits of &quot;Daria&quot; episode &quot;Through a Lens Darkly&quot;). However, the second single, &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot;, received much exposure when it was featured on the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; soundtrack a year later. &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; peaked at number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The re-released version of the album contains different versions of &quot;Rim Shak&quot; and &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; than the original release. The difference between the two versions was that the second version had Scott Riebling playing bass and Stacy Jones playing drums, while the first release featured Brian Karp, who originally played bass and wrote music for the band. A demo version of &quot;I See&quot; is available on the 1998 compilation release, &quot;Sister&quot;, with Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the record’s airy sonics, Kay Hanley’s soaring vocals and the band’s smart pop-rock songwriting make for a solid, if not especially challenging, effort.&quot;

<text>Peking opera, or Beijing opera (), is the most dominant form of Chinese opera, which combines instrumental music, vocal performance, mime, martial arts, dance and acrobatics. It arose in Beijing in the mid-Qing dynasty (1644–1912) and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. The form was extremely popular in the Qing court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China. Major performance troupes are based in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai. The art form is also preserved in Taiwan, where it is also known as (). It has also spread to other regions such as the United States and Japan.

Peking opera features four main role types, &quot;sheng&quot; (gentlemen), &quot;dan&quot; (women), &quot;jing&quot; (rough men), and &quot;chou&quot; (clowns). Performing troupes often have several of each variety, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the () and () styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore and, increasingly, contemporary life.

Traditional Peking opera was denounced as &quot;feudalistic&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) and replaced mostly with the revolutionary operas until the period&#x27;s end. After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. In recent years, Peking opera has responded to sagging audience numbers by attempting reforms, including improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, shortening works, and performing new and original plays.

==Etymology==
&quot;Peking opera&quot; is the English term for the art form; the term entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1953. &quot;Beijing opera&quot; is a more recent equivalent.

In China, the art form has been known by many names at different times and places. The earliest Chinese name, , was a combination of the and melodies. As it increased in popularity, its name became or , which reflected its start in the capital city (). From 1927 to 1949, when Beijing was known as Beiping, Peking opera was known as or to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of this theatre in mainland China was established as . The Taiwanese name for this type of opera, , or &quot;national opera&quot;, reflects disputes over the true seat of the Chinese government.

==History==
===Origins===

Peking opera was born when the Four Great Anhui Troupes brought Hui opera, or what is now called &quot;Huiju&quot;, in 1790 to Beijing, for the eightieth birthday of the Qianlong Emperor on 25 September. It was originally staged for the court and only made available to the public later. In 1828, several famous Hubei troupes arrived in Beijing and performed jointly with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Peking opera&#x27;s melodies. Peking opera is generally regarded as having fully formed by 1845. Although it is called Peking opera (Beijing theatre style), its origins are in the greater areas of the capital of Anhui province (the City of Anqing), including southern Anhui and eastern Hubei, which share the similar dialect of Xiajiang Mandarin (Lower Yangtze Mandarin). Peking opera&#x27;s two main melodies, and . literally means &quot;skin puppet show&quot;, referring to the puppet show that originated in Shaanxi province. Chinese puppet shows always involve singing. Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic form of Mandarin Chinese, in which the Zhongyuan Mandarin dialects of Henan and Shaanxi are closest. This form of Mandarin is recorded in the book . It also absorbed music from other operas and local &quot;Zhili&quot; musical art forms. Some scholars believe that the musical form was derived from the historic Qinqiang, while many conventions of staging, performance elements, and aesthetic principles were retained from Kunqu, the form that preceded it as court art.

Thus, Peking opera is not a monolithic form, but rather a coalescence of many older forms. However, the new form also creates its own innovations. The vocal requirements for all of the major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera. The Chou, in particular, rarely has a singing part in Peking opera, unlike the equivalent role in style. The melodies that accompany each play were also simplified, and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms. Perhaps most noticeably, true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera. The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century. The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence in the middle of the century and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the Taiping Rebellion. Beginning in 1884, the Empress Dowager Cixi became a regular patron of Peking opera, cementing its status over earlier forms like . The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form, with only a few voices and singing patterns. This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves.
At the time of its growth in the late nineteenth century, albums became used to display aspects of stage culture, including makeup and costumes of performers.

Peking opera was initially an exclusively male pursuit. There were bans on female performers and major limitations on female audience members, so the art form mainly catered to the tastes of male audience members. Qing dynasty emperors repeatedly banned female performers beginning with Kangxi Emperor in 1671. The last ban was by the Qianlong Emperor who banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance of women on the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for the lifting of the ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.

===Model &quot;revolutionary opera&quot; and Peking opera in Taiwan===

After the Chinese Civil War, Peking opera became a focal point of identity for both involved parties. When the Chinese Communist Party came to power in mainland China in 1949, the newly formed government moved to bring art into line with Communist ideology, and &quot;to make art and literature a component of the whole revolutionary machine&quot;. To this end, dramatic works without Communist themes were considered subversive, and were ultimately banned during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976).

The use of opera as a tool to transmit communist ideology reached its climax in the Cultural Revolution, under the purview of Jiang Qing, wife of Mao Zedong. The &quot;model operas&quot; were considered one of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and were meant to express Mao&#x27;s view that &quot;art must serve the interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and must conform to proletarian ideology.&quot;

Among the eight model plays eventually retained during that time were five Peking operas. Notable among these operas was &quot;The Legend of the Red Lantern&quot;, which was approved as a concert with piano accompaniment based on a suggestion from Jiang Qing. Performances of works beyond the eight model plays were allowed only in heavily modified form. The endings of many traditional plays were changed, and visible stage assistants in Peking opera were eliminated. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, traditional Peking opera began to be performed again. Peking opera and other theatrical art forms were a controversial subject both before and during the Twelfth National People&#x27;s Congress in 1982. A study carried in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; revealed that over 80 percent of musical dramas staged in the country were traditional plays from the pre-Communist era, as opposed to newly written historical dramas promoting socialist values. In response, Communist party officials enacted reforms to curb liberalism and foreign influence in theatrical works.

After the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949, Peking opera there took on a special status of &quot;political symbolism&quot;, in which the Kuomintang government encouraged the art form over other forms of performance in an attempt to claim a position as the sole representative of Chinese culture. This often occurred at the expense of traditional Taiwanese opera. Due to its status as a prestigious art form with a long history, Peking opera has indeed been studied more and received more monetary support than other forms of theater in Taiwan. However, there has also been a competing movement towards advocating native opera to differentiate Taiwan from the mainland. In September 1990, when the Kuomintang government participated in a state-sponsored mainland cultural event for the first time, a Taiwanese opera group was sent, possibly to emphasize &quot;Taiwaneseness&quot;.

===Modern Peking opera===

During the second half of the 20th century, Peking opera witnessed a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.

In addition to more formal reform measures, Peking-opera troupes during the 1980s also adopted more unofficial changes. Some of those seen in traditional works have been called &quot;technique for technique&#x27;s sake&quot;. This has included the use of extended high pitch sequences by female Dan, and the addition of lengthier movement sections and percussion sequences to traditional works. Such changes have generally met with disdain from Peking-opera performers, who see them as ploys to gain immediate audience appeal. Plays with repetitive sequences have also been shortened to hold audience interest. New works have naturally experienced a greater freedom to experiment. Regional, popular, and foreign techniques have been adopted, including Western-style makeup and beards and new face paint designs for Jing characters. The spirit of reform continued during the 1990s. To survive in an increasingly open market, troupes like the Shanghai Peking Opera Company needed to bring traditional Peking opera to new audiences. To do this, they have offered an increasing number of free performances in public areas.

There has also been a general feeling of a shift in the creative attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright-centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.

Channel CCTV-11 in mainland China is currently dedicated to broadcasting classic Chinese opera productions, including Peking opera.

===Peking opera around the world===
In addition to its presence in mainland China, Peking opera has spread to many other places. It can be found in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities elsewhere.

Mei Lanfang, one of the most famous Dan performers of all time, was also one of the greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan. This inspired an American tour in February 1930. Although some, such as the actor Otis Skinner, believed that Peking opera could never be a success in the United States, the favorable reception of Mei and his troupe in New York City disproved this notion. The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five. Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the University of California and Pomona College. He followed this tour with a tour in the Soviet Union in 1935.

The theatre department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa has been home to English-language for more than twenty-five years. The school offers Asian Theatre as a focus area in its Theatre and Performance Studies program and has regular performances, the most recent being &quot;Lady Mu and the Yang Family Generals&quot; in 2014.

==Performers and roles==
===&quot;Sheng&quot;===

The () is the main male role in Beijing opera. This role has numerous subtypes. The is a dignified older role. These characters have a gentle and cultivated disposition and wear sensible costumes. One type of role is the , a red-faced older male. The only two roles are Guan Gong, the Chinese God of War, and Zhao Kuang-yin, the first Song dynasty emperor. Young male characters are known as . These characters sing in a high, shrill voice with occasional breaks to represent the voice changing period of adolescence. Depending on the character&#x27;s rank in society, the costume of the may be either elaborate or simple. Off-stage, actors are often involved with beautiful women by virtue of the handsome and young image they project. The is a martial character for roles involving combat. They are highly trained in acrobatics, and have a natural voice when singing. Troupes will always have a actor. A actor may also be added to play roles fitting to his age. In addition to these main , the troupe will also have a secondary .

===&quot;Dan&quot;===

The &quot;Dan&quot; () refers to any female role in Beijing opera. roles were originally divided into five subtypes. Old women were played by , martial women were , young female warriors were , virtuous and elite women were , and vivacious and unmarried women were . One of Mei Lanfang&#x27;s most important contributions to Beijing opera was in pioneering a sixth type of role, the . This role type combines the status of the with the sensuality of the . A troupe will have a young to play main roles, as well as an older for secondary parts. Four examples of famous &quot;s&quot; are Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng. In the early years of Beijing opera, all roles were played by men. Wei Changsheng, a male performer in the Qing court, developed the , or &quot;false foot&quot; technique, to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice. The ban on female performers also led to a controversial form of brothel, known as the , in which men paid to have sex with young boys dressed as females. Ironically, the performing skills taught to the youths employed in these brothels led many of them to become professional later in life.

===&quot;Jing&quot;===

The () is a painted face male role. Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles. This type of role will entail a forceful character, so a must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures. Beijing opera boasts 16 basic facial patterns, but there are over 100 specific variations. The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person&#x27;s face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include red, which denotes uprightness and loyalty, white, which represents evil or crafty characters, and black, which is given to characters of soundness and integrity. Three main types of roles are often seen. These include , a loyal general with a black face who excels in singing, , a complex character played by a skilled actor, and , a martial and acrobatic character.

===&quot;Chou&quot;===

The () is a male clown role. The usually plays secondary roles in a troupe. Indeed, most studies of Beijing opera classify the as a minor role. The name of the role is a homophone of the Mandarin Chinese word , meaning &quot;ugly&quot;. This reflects the traditional belief that the clown&#x27;s combination of ugliness and laughter could drive away evil spirits. roles can be divided into , civilian roles such as merchants and jailers, and , minor military roles. The combines comic acting and acrobatics. characters are generally amusing and likable, if a bit foolish. Their costumes range from simple for characters of lower status to elaborate, perhaps overly so, for high-status characters. characters wear special face paint, called , that differs from that of characters. The defining characteristic of this type of face paint is a small patch of white chalk around the nose. This can represent either a mean and secretive nature or a quick wit.

Beneath the whimsical persona of the , a serious connection to the form of Beijing opera exists. The is the character most connected to the &quot;guban&quot;, the drums and clapper commonly used for musical accompaniment during performances. The actor often uses the in solo performance, especially when performing , light-hearted verses spoken for comedic effect. The clown is also connected to the small gong and cymbals, percussion instruments that symbolize the lower classes and the raucous atmosphere inspired by the role. Although characters do not sing frequently, their arias feature large amounts of improvisation. This is considered a license of the role, and the orchestra will accompany the actor even as he bursts into an unscripted folk song. However, due to the standardization of Beijing opera and political pressure from government authorities, improvisation has lessened in recent years. The has a vocal timbre that is distinct from other characters, as the character will often speak in the common Beijing dialect, as opposed to the more formal dialects of other characters.

==Training==
Becoming a Peking opera performer takes a long and difficult apprenticeship starting at an early age. Before the 20th century, students were often picked personally at a young age by a teacher and trained for seven years on account of the contract from the child&#x27;s parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the student during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o&#x27;clock in the morning for exercise. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theaters in the evening. The entire group was beaten with bamboo canes if they made any mistakes during such performances. Schools with less harsh training methods began appearing in 1930, but all schools were closed in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.

Performers are first trained in acrobatics, followed by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, all based on the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively in the art of performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.

==Visual performance elements==
Peking-opera performers use four main skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, and all other types of dance. The final skill is combat, which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills are expected to be performed effortlessly, in keeping with the spirit of the art form.

===Aesthetic aims and principles of movement===
Peking opera follows other traditional Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers is to put beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, but this does not mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long-held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening their costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.

Many performances deal with behaviors that occur in daily life. However, in accordance with the overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of , mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often take the form of a smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.

===Staging and costumes===
Peking opera stages have traditionally been square platforms. The action on stage is usually visible from at least three sides. The stage is divided into two parts by an embroidered curtain called a . Musicians are visible to the audience on the front part of the stage. Traditional Peking opera stages were built above the line of sight of the viewers, but some modern stages have been constructed with higher audience seating. Viewers are always seated south of the stage. Therefore, north is the most important direction in Peking opera, and performers will immediately move to &quot;center north&quot; upon entering the stage. All characters enter from the east and exit from the west. In line with the highly symbolic nature of Peking opera, the form uses very few props. This reflects seven centuries of Chinese performance tradition. The presence of large objects is frequently indicated through conventions. The stage will almost always have a table and at least one chair, which can be turned through convention into such diverse objects as a city wall, a mountain, or a bed. Peripheral objects will often be used to signify the presence of a larger, main object. For example, a whip is used to indicate a horse and an oar symbolizes a boat.

The length and internal structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, , short plays or plays made up of short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include all four of the main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression from the beginning of the play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play &quot;The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated&quot; begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes that involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.

Due to the scarcity of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a , or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often in the design of a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the , a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the , a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in with the rest of the costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low-soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.

===Stage properties (&quot;Qimo&quot;)===

 (stage props) is the name for all stage properties and some simple decorations. The term first occurred in the Jin dynasty (266–420). includes articles of everyday life such as candlesticks, lanterns, fans, handkerchiefs, brushes, paper, ink and ink slabs, and tea and wine sets. The props also include: sedan chairs, vehicle flags, oars, and horsewhips, as well as weapons. Also employed are various articles to demonstrate environments, such as cloth backdrops to represent cities, and curtains, flags, table curtains, and chair covers. Traditional are not just imitations of real articles, but also artistic articles in their own right. Flags are also frequently used on the stage. A square flag with the Chinese character for &quot;marshal&quot; on it, a rectangular flag with the Chinese character for &quot;commander&quot; on it, and a flag with the name of a certain army on it represent the location of army camps and commanders-in-chief. In addition, there are water, fire, wind, and vehicle flags. Actors shake these flags to represent waves, fire, wind, or moving vehicles.

==Aural performance elements==
===Vocal production===
Vocal production in Peking opera is conceived of as being composed of &quot;four levels of song&quot;: songs with music, verse recitation, prose dialogue, and non-verbal vocalizations. The conception of a sliding scale of vocalization creates a sense of smooth continuity between songs and speech. The three basic categories of vocal production technique are the use of breath (), pronunciation (), and special Peking-opera pronunciation ().

In Chinese opera, breath is based in the pubic region and supported by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that &quot;strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages&quot; (). Breath is visualized as being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region to the top of the head. This &quot;cavity&quot; must be under performers&#x27; control at all times, and they develop special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as &quot;exchanging breath&quot; () and &quot;stealing breath&quot; (). &quot;Exchanging breath&quot; is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. &quot;Stealing breath&quot; is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is &quot;saving the breath&quot; (). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be &quot;exchanged&quot; or &quot;stolen&quot;. These intervals are often marked by carats.

Pronunciation is conceptualized as shaping the throat and mouth into the shape necessary to produce the desired vowel sound, and clearly articulating the initial consonant. There are four basic shapes for the throat and mouth, corresponding to four vowel types, and five methods of articulating consonants, one for each type of consonant. The four throat and mouth shapes are &quot;opened-mouth&quot; (), &quot;level-teeth&quot; (), &quot;closed-mouth&quot; ( or ), and &quot;scooped-lips&quot; (). The five consonant types are denoted by the portion of the mouth most critical to each type&#x27;s production: throat, or larynx (); tongue (); molars, or the jaws and palate (); front teeth (); and lips ().

Some syllables (written Chinese characters) have special pronunciations in Peking opera. This is due to the collaboration with regional forms and kunqu that occurred during the development of Peking opera. For example, , meaning &quot;you&quot;, may be pronounced , as it is in the Anhui dialect, rather than the Standard Chinese . , meaning &quot;&quot; and pronounced in Standard Chinese, becomes , as it is pronounced in the dialect of Suzhou. In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms, the readings of some characters have been changed to promote ease of performance or vocal variety. For example, , , , and sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain, because they are produced far back in the mouth. Therefore, they are performed with an additional &quot;i&quot; sound, as in .

These techniques and conventions of vocal production are used to create the two main categories of vocalizations in Peking opera: stage speech and song.

===Stage speech===
Peking opera is performed using both Classical Chinese and Modern Standard Chinese with some slang terms added for color. The social position of the character being played determines the type of language that is used. Peking opera features three major types of stage speech (, ). Monologues and dialogue, which make up the majority of most plays, consist of prose speeches. The purpose of prose speech is to advance the plot of the play or inject humor into a scene. They are usually short, and are performed mostly using vernacular language. However, as Elizabeth Wichmann points out, they also have rhythmic and musical elements, achieved through the &quot;stylized articulation of monosyllabic sound units&quot; and the &quot;stylized pronunciation of speech-tones&quot;, respectively. Prose speeches were frequently improvised during the early period of Peking opera&#x27;s development, and performers carry on that tradition today.

The second main type of stage speech consists of quotations drawn from classical Chinese poetry. This type is rarely used in Peking opera; plays have one or two such quotations at most, and often none at all. In most instances, the use of classical poetry is intended to heighten the impact of a scene. However, &quot;Chou&quot; and more whimsical &quot;Dan&quot; characters may misquote or misinterpret the classical lines, creating a comical effect.

The final category of stage speech is conventionalized stage speeches (). These are rigid formulations that mark important transition points. When a character enters for the first time, an entrance speech () or self-introduction speech () is given, which includes a prelude poem, a set-the-scene poem, and a prose set-the-scene speech, in that order. The style and structure of each entrance speech is inherited from earlier Yuan dynasty, Ming dynasty, folk, and regional forms of Chinese opera. Another conventionalized stage speech is the exit speech, which may take the form of a poem followed by a single spoken line. This speech is usually delivered by a supporting character, and describes their present situation and state of mind. Finally, there is the recapitulation speech, in which a character will use prose to recount the story up to that point. These speeches came about as a result of the tradition of performing only one part of a larger play.

===Song===
There are six main types of song lyrics in Peking opera: emotive, condemnatory, narrative, descriptive, disputive, and &quot;shared space separate sensations&quot; lyrics. Each type uses the same basic lyrical structure, differing only in kind and degree of emotions portrayed. Lyrics are written in couplets () consisting of two lines (). Couplets can consist of two ten character lines, or two seven character lines. The lines are further subdivided into three (lit. &quot;pause&quot;), typically in a 3-3-4 or 2-2-3 pattern. Lines may be &quot;padded&quot; with extra characters for the purpose of clarifying meaning. Rhyme is an extremely important device in Peking opera, with thirteen identified rhyme categories. Song lyrics also use the speech tones of Mandarin Chinese in ways that are pleasing to the ear and convey proper meaning and emotion. The first and second of Chinese&#x27;s four tones are normally known as &quot;level&quot; () tones in Peking opera, while the third and fourth are called &quot;oblique&quot; (). The closing line of every couplet in a song ends in a level tone.

Songs in Peking opera are proscribed by a set of common aesthetic values. A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs at the very top of their vocal range. For this reason, the idea of a song&#x27;s key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a &quot;controlled nasal tone&quot;. Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is &quot;slower&quot; and &quot;wider&quot; than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression , meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or &quot;round&quot;.

===Music===
The accompaniment for a Peking opera performance usually consists of a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the &quot;jinghu&quot;, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the player follows the basic contours of the song&#x27;s melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the player adopts their own signature version of the song&#x27;s melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations on the part of the performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the player must have an instinctive ability to change their performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.

The second is the circular bodied plucked lute, the &quot;yueqin&quot;. Percussion instruments include the &quot;daluo&quot;, &quot;xiaoluo&quot;, and &quot;naobo&quot;. The player of the &quot;gu&quot; and &quot;ban&quot;, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, and , originally differed in subtle ways. In the style, the strings of the are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style&#x27;s derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In , on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style&#x27;s place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including (a slow tempo), (a standard, medium-fast tempo), (&quot;leading beat&quot;), (&quot;leading beat&quot;), (&quot;rubato beat&quot;), and (&quot;shaking beat&quot;). The style also uses several unique tempos, including (&quot;two-six&quot;), and (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, , , and are most commonly seen. The tempo at any given time is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. has been seen as more improvisational, and as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.

The melodies played by the accompaniment mainly fall into three broad categories. The first is the aria. The arias of Peking opera can be further divided into those of the and varieties. An example of an aria is , an aria in the style that is sung by a young to indicate heightened emotion. The second type of melody heard in Peking opera is the fixed-tune melody, or . These are instrumental tunes that serve a wider range of purposes than arias. Examples include the &quot;Water Dragon Tune&quot; (), which generally denotes the arrival of an important person, and &quot;Triple Thrust&quot; (), which may signal a feast or banquet. The final type of musical accompaniment is the percussion pattern. Such patterns provide context to the music in ways similar to the fixed-tune melodies. For example, there are as many as 48 different percussion patterns that accompany stage entrances. Each one identifies the entering character by their individual rank and personality.
==Repertoire==
The repertoire of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, political and military struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as &quot;.&quot; Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems have been used to sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion in this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young , , and , while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and . In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either (serious) or (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.

Since 1949, a more detailed classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play&#x27;s creation. The first category in this system is , traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is , historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is , contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In the second half of the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;, among others. In 2017, Li Wenrui wrote in &quot;China Daily&quot; that 10 masterpieces of the traditional Peking opera repertoire are &quot;The Drunken Concubine&quot;, &quot;Monkey King&quot;, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;A River All Red&quot;, Wen Ouhong&#x27;s &quot;Unicorn Trapping Purse&quot; (&quot;the representative work of Peking Opera master Chen Yanqiu&quot;), &quot;White Snake Legend&quot;, &quot;The Ruse of the Empty City&quot; (from &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;), Du Mingxin&#x27;s &quot;Female Generals of the Yang Family&quot;, &quot;Wild Boar Forest&quot;, and &quot;The Phoenix Returns Home&quot;.

==Film==
Peking opera and its stylistic devices have appeared in many Chinese films. It often was used to signify a unique &quot;Chineseness&quot; in contrast to sense of culture being presented in Japanese films. Fei Mu, a director of the pre-Communist era, used Peking opera in a number of plays, sometimes within Westernized, realistic plots. King Hu, a later Chinese film director, used many of the formal norms of Peking opera in his films, such as the parallelism between music, voice, and gesture. In the 1993 film &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, by Chen Kaige, Peking opera serves as the object of pursuit for the protagonists and a backdrop for their romance. However, the film&#x27;s portrayal of Peking opera has been criticized as one-dimensional.

<text>Susan Olivia Poole (1889–1975) was an Indigenous Canadian inventor. She invented the Jolly Jumper, a baby jumper, in 1910, but it was not until 1948 that they were produced for the retail market. They are manufactured in Ontario, Canada. By 1957, the Jolly Jumper was patented.

== Early life ==
Born in 1889 in Devil&#x27;s Lake, North Dakota, Poole grew up in Minnesota at the White Earth Indian Reservation. She was part Ojibway or Chippewa. At a young age, she observed how women would strap babies to cradle boards, a practice called &quot;papoose&quot;. While working in the fields, she also observed how mothers would hang their papooses on tree branches, using leather straps, as a medium for a soft bouncing motion.

== Education ==
Poole was a very talented pianist. She studied music at Manitoba, Canada&#x27;s Brandon College.

== Personal life ==
Poole married and had seven children, the first a boy named Joseph. After his birth, she began putting a swing together that resembled the practice she remembered as a young girl. After her invention, she moved to Vancouver, British Columbia with her husband in 1942.

== Invention ==
Poole used a broom handle and cloth diaper in her first attempts at creating the swing that is now known as &quot;The Jolly Jumper&quot;. The broom handle was used as a suspension bar and the diaper for a harness. By the early 1950s, her family convinced her to take the swing commercially. She was awarded a patent in 1957, with the help of her son Joseph. She was one of the first Indigenous Canadian women to be awarded a patent. She later established Poole Manufacturing Co., Ltd, which she sold in the 1960s.

== Later years ==
Poole died at the age of 86 on October 10, 1975, in Ganges, Capital Regional District, British Columbia, Canada. She is buried at Royal Oak Burial Park Cemetery in Victoria, Capital Regional District, British Columbia, Canada. Her invention is still being sold today. There are over 200 items manufactured under the Jolly Jumper name, including potty trainers, baby accessories, car seats, etc.

<doc id="618679" wikidata="Q1438297" url="?curid=618679" title="Port Kembla, New South Wales">
<text>Port Kembla is a suburb of Wollongong 10 km south of the CBD and part of the Illawarra region of New South Wales. The suburb comprises a seaport, industrial complex (one of the largest in Australia), a small harbour foreshore nature reserve, and a small commercial sector. It is situated on the tip of Red Point: its first European sighting was by Captain James Cook in 1770. The name &quot;Kembla&quot; is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;plenty [of] wild fowl&quot;.

==History==
Before Port Kembla was an industrial suburb of Wollongong, it was a town with a remarkably self-sufficient society, a growing commercial centre, and a vibrant civic life. Town subdivision began in 1908, and by 1921 there were 1622 residents. Economic expansion propelled further population growth. Port Kembla derives its name from its proximity to Mount Kembla.

===Industrial change===
A copper smelter and refinery, the Electrolytic Refinery and Smelting Company of Australia, began production in 1908, followed by the opening of Metal Manufactures in 1917 and finally the arrival of the Hoskins Iron &amp; Steel Works in 1927. The works became Australian Iron &amp; Steel the following year.

By 1947 the town&#x27;s population had increased to 4,960 with smaller satellite suburbs such as Cringila and Lake Heights, mushrooming on its fringes. That year, 1947, marked the climax of a local campaign for municipal autonomy which was ultimately thwarted by the creation of a Greater City of Wollongong. In the post-Second World War period there was an inexorable decline of a &#x27;Port Kembla&#x27; society as local town boundaries were slowly but surely absorbed into a more Wollongong-focused or regional identity.

===Cultural diversity===
Despite the decline from the heyday of the 1920s, the town experienced major social and demographic change in the 1950s and 1960s. Waves of migrants, mostly from the United Kingdom, Italy, Macedonia and Germany, moved to the town. During this period, Port Kembla was on the cusp of changes affecting Australian society generally as new ethnic and cultural influences found a place in local society. With its long migration history accommodating waves of migrant workers and their families, Port Kembla is still one of the most culturally diverse suburbs in New South Wales.

===Hill 60===
Port Kembla&#x27;s highest point, Hill 60, overlooks the Five Islands and Red Point. Hill 60, originally the site of an Aboriginal settlement, was used by the army during World War II to make a coastal gun emplacement known as Illowra Battery. In September 1942, Aboriginal inhabitants were forcibly evicted from the area. It has remained in public ownership and is now a public lookout reserve, despite a vigorous campaign to return some of the land to its Aboriginal owners. Although not technically open to tourists, the tunnels are open, and can be explored by foot. The entrance to the tunnels is located almost under the coastguard tower on Hill 60, and can be seen down the left when standing at the information board, facing southeast.
===HMAS Adele loss===
On 7 May 1943, Australian steamer Adele struck the breakwater at Port Kembla and was subsequently declared a total loss. The wreck of &quot;Adele&quot; is protected under the New South Wales Heritage Act, 1977.

=== Union Protests ===
Port Kembla was the site of the Dalfram Dispute in 1938, where unionised dockworkers refused to load pig iron onto a ship heading for Japan after the Nanking Massacre. In 1974, a green ban was placed by the Builders Labourers Federation against high rise development and for the reclamation of the beach to be made a parkland.

The Jobs for Women campaign won the right for women to work at the Port Kembla steelworks. The campaign won a historic court case under the Anti-Discrimination Act and set a precedent for the employment of women in non-traditional areas of work and the interpretation of direct and indirect discrimination.

== Heritage listings ==
Port Kembla has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Military Road: Hill 60

==Population==
According to the of Population, there were 5,088 people in Port Kembla.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.5% of the population. 
* 70.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Macedonia 8.1%, Italy 2.4% and England 2.0%. 
* 71.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Macedonian 12.0% and Italian 3.0%. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.5%, Catholic 23.7%, Eastern Orthodox 14.1% and Anglican 8.3%.

==Climate==
Port Kembla has a warm oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with humid summers and mild, crisp winters. The suburb enjoys abundant sunshine, getting 111.4 clear days, annually.
==Industry and Infrastructure==

Port Kembla is known for the BlueScope steelworks operations on Springhill Road and throughout North Port Kembla. 
Other notable industrial operations in the suburb are: Port Kembla Coal Terminal, Port Kembla Copper, Incitec, Adstream Services, Port Kembla Gateway and GrainCorp.

Port Kembla has a railway station on the Port Kembla branch of the Illawarra railway line. It is the terminus of the branch line, and serves the residential area of the suburb of the same name. The station has one side platform, used for terminating trains. It is served by approximately one train per hour, usually a local service to Thirroul and Waterfall, but extra direct trains to and from Sydney are provided in the peak hours.

Pacific National operates daily coal trains to the Inner Harbour section of the port, and into the blast furnace section of the steelworks.
Downer Rail has a workshop opposite the station that services diesel powered locomotives for Pacific National.

===Port===
Port Kembla harbour is a major export location for coal mined in the southern and western regions of New South Wales.
As part of the state governments plan to divert ships containing automobiles, the port has received significant upgrades and infrastructure including a new Maritime Office and many jobs have been created as the need for port logistics grows. Patrick Corporation holds a contract for integrated port services in the harbour and transports goods by road or rail through its parent company Pacific National.

The port has a range of berths for loading coal, grain, shipping containers and other goods. As of 2020, a gas export terminal is also under development. 
Port Kembla was identified by the Australian Defence Department in 2023 as the most likely location to homeport the future Australian nuclear-powered submarines, probably active no earlier than the 2030s.

==Health and environmental issues==
===Port Kembla chimney stack===

Port Kembla was home to one of Australia&#x27;s tallest industrial chimneys, a 198 metre tall chimney built in 1965. Port Kembla Primary School was once located adjacent to it but was closed down due to pollution problems from the chimney including lead contaminated soil, acid rain and soot. A warning alarm was fitted to warn of high toxin levels. In November 2008, the Port Kembla stack was inspected and confirmed to have concrete cancer. The stack was planned to be demolished in early 2010 at a cost of A$10 million.

By 6 September 2010, plans to knock down the stack had been revised by the NSW Department of Planning. These plans included demolition of the existing Port Kembla Copper structures surrounding the chimney, excluding the locally heritage listed Precious Metals Mill Chimney and the Assay Offices. The work was due to start in the middle of 2011 with a team of 30 workers, under supervision by NSW Police, NSW WorkCover and relevant emergency services at a cost of A$8 million with an expected time frame of 16 months.

On 2 August 2013, it was announced that the stack would be demolished on Friday 6 September 2013. Due to asbestos concerns, the demolition was delayed. After no signs of danger were found, a new date was announced for the demolition: 20 February 2014.

On 20 February 2014, the copper stack was demolished.

===Industrial pollution===

In the past, Port Kembla&#x27;s industrial heart was associated with significant industrial pollution including emissions of nitrogen oxides and other dangerous gases. However, the air quality around Port Kembla has improved dramatically over the past decade. At nearby Kembla Grange the average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the NSW Department of Environment Climate Change halved between 2002 and 2014.

Back in the 1990s health problems were associated with noxious gases. One 1998 study of the industrial areas of Newcastle and Port Kembla found &#x27;an important association between relatively low levels of particulate air pollution and respiratory symptoms&#x27; among primary school children. Fallout has also introduced elevated levels of lead and other heavy metals to the soil around Port Kembla and has formed thick deposits in many buildings and industrial structures.

<doc id="618682" wikidata="Q3433024" url="?curid=618682" title="Elidor">
<text>Elidor is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel by the British author Alan Garner, published by Collins in 1965. Set primarily in modern Manchester, it features four English children who enter a fantasy world, fulfill a quest there, and return to find that the enemy has followed them into our world. Translations have been published in nine languages and it has been adapted for television and radio.

The story concerns the adventures of a group of children as they struggle to hold back a terrible darkness by fulfilling a prophecy from another world. The setting moves to and from the world of Elidor, and the city of Manchester and parts of northern Cheshire in the real world.

Like many of Garner&#x27;s books, the emphasis of the narrative is on the hardships, cost and practicalities of the choices and responsibilities that the protagonists face.

==Plot==
The Watson children, Nicholas, David, Helen and Roland, wander towards a street which Roland randomly selected from a map of Manchester. This fictional street is later revealed to be roughly in the Newton Heath area, which is undergoing slum clearance. The neighbourhood is deserted except for a strange fiddler. Roland kicks a ball into the window of a partly demolished church. When his three siblings, who separately entered the church to retrieve the ball, all fail to return, Roland follows. The fiddler&#x27;s music opens a portal to the world of Elidor and he instructs Roland to step through.

The music leads Roland through a barren castle and a desolate forest, to the Mound of Vandwy (a reference to the artificial Silbury Hill), where Roland mentally battles a stone circle that seems alive. The fiddler, Malebron, then reveals himself and says the other siblings are in the mound. To enter, Roland must picture the porch of the family&#x27;s new home in his mind, which causes it to appear on the hillside. Inside, Helen, David and Nicholas are entranced by a tree, whose spell Roland breaks by severing it with a spear Malebron gave him. The other children find a cauldron, sword and keystone before exiting. With the spear, these are the Four Treasures of Elidor.

Malebron explains the children are part of a prophesy. Elidor is being overcome by an unspecified darkness and can only be saved by hearing the Song of Findhorn. Should Elidor perish, it &quot;would not be without echo in [the children&#x27;s] world&quot;. The darkness chases the children back to where Malebron opened the portal. He says they must keep the Treasures safe in England. The children emerge back in the church where no time has passed and the Treasures have become mundane objects, but they are later found to interfere with electronics and give off static electricity.

The children bury the Treasures in a Faraday cage in their garden. While digging, Helen finds a vase with a unicorn picture and a cryptic inscription, later revealed to mean that only a woman can communicate with the unicorn. Over the next year, Nicholas rationalises their experience as a &quot;mass hallucination&quot;, but Roland, having imagined their front door to enter Vandwy, believes that strange rattling sounds mean it is still connected to Elidor. He also sees shadows above the Treasures which have no real counterpart.

At a Christmas party, Roland is made to operate a planchette in a séance. He writes &quot;Malebron&quot;, draws a unicorn and writes &quot;Findhorn&quot;. On the way home, a unicorn suddenly appears in the mist. David thinks the static comes from Elidor in an attempt to home in on the signal from the buried Treasures. When all four children observe the shadows, they resolve into Elidor men who escape into the Manchester suburbs. After the Watson parents go out for a party, the children dig up the Treasures but are not sure what to do with them. The door rattling intensifies and they decide they cannot remain in the house while it is dark.

They encounter a drunk bus passenger who reports seeing a unicorn, and the bus happens to take them back to the church from which they entered Elidor. In the dark, the children are separated. Roland finds Findhorn fighting the Elidor men. David and Nicholas turn up but Findhorn ignores their pleas for him to sing. Helen finds Findhorn and appears to listen to her. The men kill Findhorn whereupon he sings; a portal to Elidor opens showing the darkness gone. The children toss the Treasures into the portal where they resume their original form, and the story abruptly ends with the children alone in the slum.

==Title==
The name &quot;Elidor&quot; originates in a Welsh folktale whose title is commonly translated as &quot;Elidor and the Golden Ball&quot;, described by Giraldus Cambrensis in &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot;, a record of his 1188 journey across the country. Elidor was a priest who as a boy was led by dwarves to a castle of gold in a land that, while beautiful, was not illuminated by the full light of the sun. This compares with Garner&#x27;s description of the golden walls of Gorias contrasting with the dull sky of the land of Elidor.

==Allusions and references==
===English folklore===
&quot;Elidor&quot; begins with an epigraph quoting from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;: &quot;Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower came&quot; (Act III, sc. 4). This is also an allusion to the English folktale of &quot;Childe Rowland&quot;, from which several elements of the plot of &quot;Elidor&quot; are drawn. &quot;Childe Rowland&quot; features the eponymous Rowland, his two brothers, and his sister Burd Ellen. Rowland kicks a ball over a church and when Burd Ellen attempts to retrieve it she disappears. Rowland&#x27;s brothers then leave to find her but they do not return, leaving Rowland to rescue his siblings. Later Rowland must command a door to open in a hillside, wherein he finds Burd Ellen under a spell.

===Irish legend===
The four castles of Elidor – Findias in the South, Falias in the West, Murias in the North, and Gorias in the East – correspond to the four cities of the Tuatha Dé Danann in Irish legend and old history – Finias (sic), Falias, Murias, and Gorias.

The four treasures of Elidor – the Spear of Ildana held by Malebron, David&#x27;s sword, Nicholas&#x27;s stone, and Helen&#x27;s cauldron – correspond to the Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann – the Spear of Lugh, Claíomh Solais, Lia Fáil, and The Dagda&#x27;s Cauldron. However, the associations between the treasures and the castles differ – in &quot;Elidor&quot; the Spear of Ildana is associated with Gorias, whereas the Irish mystical equivalent, the Spear of Lugh, is associated with Finias (although the treasure associated with Gorias, Claíomh Solais, is sometimes called the Sword of Lugh, which may explain the confusion).

===Medieval fable===
Late in the book a dying unicorn sings a &#x27;swan song&#x27; and by this act brings a restitution of light to Elidor. According to the medieval legend, only the calming presence of a virgin can tame the wild and ferocious nature of the unicorn and only thus may it be killed.

== Recognition ==
&quot;Elidor&quot; was a commended runner-up for the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject.

==Television adaptation==
Garner and Don Webb adapted &quot;Elidor&quot; into a children&#x27;s television series for the BBC. The series consisted of six half-hour episodes broadcast weekly from 4 January to 8 February 1995, starring Damian Zuk as Roland and Suzanne Shaw as Helen.

==Publication history==
Henry Z. Walck published the first US edition in 1967. German and Japanese-language translations were published in 1969 followed by Catalan, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, and Dutch in the next two decades; Persian and Chinese in 2005.

<doc id="618687" wikidata="Q7763938" url="?curid=618687" title="The Shops at Columbus Circle">
<text>The Shops at Columbus Circle is an upscale shopping mall in Deutsche Bank Center, a skyscraper complex in Manhattan, New York City. It is located at Columbus Circle, next to the southwestern corner of Central Park.

Then retail space, designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects, opened in February 2004 with 40 stores and 10 restaurants. The original tenant plan consisted of new locations of J. Crew, Sephora, Williams Sonoma. The shops also opened the largest Whole Foods Market at and a flagship branch of Equinox.

==Details==
The shopping mall includes Lululemon, H&amp;M, Alo, Hugo Boss, Tumi, Diptyque, J.Crew and Stuart Weitzman. The mall also has a high-esteemed collection of restaurants such as the Michelin 3-star Per Se by chef Thomas Keller, Masa by chef Masa Takayama, the East Coast flagship of Williams Sonoma, and a Whole Foods Market. It is owned by The Related Companies.

When opened, the Whole Foods Market at Columbus Circle sold liquor from an attached room near the cash registers away from the main shopping aisles. However, this configuration was in violation of New York&#x27;s liquor licensing laws, which require grocery stores to have a separate street entrance to their liquor departments, ostensibly to avoid minors from buying liquors. In 2005, Whole Foods settled with state authorities and closed its liquor operations at Columbus Circle, hoping to transfer its license to a new location it would be opening on the Lower East Side.

The Florida Mall is located at the southeast corner of the intersection between US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) and SR 482 (Sand Lake Road) and is situated near the junction of SR 528 (Beachline Expressway) and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike.

==Description==

The mall is one level and is anchored by Dillard&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, JCPenney, Sears, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, and the Crayola Experience.

The mall offers various services to shoppers including valet parking, currency exchange, and package and baggage check. The Florida Mall attracts over 20 million visitors annually, including domestic and international tourists to the Orlando area.

==History==

The mall opened on March 12, 1986, with Sears, JCPenney, Belk and the Crowne Plaza hotel (built by E.J. DeBartolo and owned in partnership with Pratt Hotel Corporation of Dallas Texas), followed by Robinson&#x27;s in September of that year. Many of the mall’s design features were borrowed from other DeBartolo malls like Aventura Mall for many expansions and Coral Square for its layout and space frame ceiling. A year later, store acquisitions and consolidations started varying the anchor lineup. Robinson&#x27;s converted to Maison Blanche in August 1987, and the Crowne Plaza rebranded as a Sheraton Plaza in 1988. Dillard&#x27;s opened two stores in 1991 at the east end filling the two remaining anchor pads. Maison Blanche was rebranded by Gayfers in early 1992 as a result of Mercantile Stores. In 1996, Belk became Saks Fifth Avenue, while the Sheraton hotel was sold to Adam&#x27;s Mark. Then, in 1998, Gayfers transitioned into Parisian, whereas Dillard&#x27;s added a second floor to their newly consolidated store at the east end, closing the other store on the southeast side that was razed for a new wing featuring Burdines, which opened in 1999. Lord &amp; Taylor replaced Parisian in 2002, and the east wing was expanded again with Central Florida&#x27;s first and only Nordstrom. Burdines merged with Macy&#x27;s in 2003, and in 2004, the hotel was purchased by a group headed by the Bank of Scotland and was renamed The Florida Hotel &amp; Conference Center. Burdines-Macy&#x27;s simply became Macy&#x27;s in 2005.

Lord &amp; Taylor shuttered in 2006, after being repositioned. Saks Fifth Avenue shuttered in 2014 as part of a strategy implemented to improve profit margins substantially by closing 35% of its entire base over the course of several years. The previous Saks Fifth Avenue outpost was reconstructed for a new wing with a new Dining Pavilion. The old food court was reconfigured to include more retail and dining space. Champs Sports and Footaction were added next to the existing Foot Locker store. In August 2014, it was announced Nordstrom would shutter after deciding against renewing their lease again because of the significant investment involved. In June 2015, Nordstrom was redesigned for Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods and the Crayola Experience.
The previous Lord &amp; Taylor outpost was razed in 2007 and overhauled into a new outdoor plaza with stores Forever 21, H&amp;M and Zara in 2009, with American Girl being added in the Fall of 2014.

In 2017, Shake Shack opened at the mall.

In early 2019, the mall hosted the Cirque du Soleil touring show &quot;Luzia&quot; under the big top. This limited engagement was the first time Cirque&#x27;s iconic big top has been raised in the Orlando area.

In 2023, Forever 21 relocated its store from across American Girl to a smaller space next to the Dining Pavilion.

On August 29, 2024 Primark opened where the Forever 21 used to be with a big focus on Disney merchandise.

==Transportation==
Right next to the mall stretches SR 528 (Beachline Expressway) which has an interchange with US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) at exit 4. The exit is only few exits away from the Orlando International Airport. The mall is also accessible from exit 254 of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, which connects to Orange Blossom Trail.

The mall is serviced by Lynx buses (links) 7, 37, 42, 107, 108, 111, 418, and 441 at the Florida Mall SuperStop. The Florida Mall SuperStop has direct bus service from several points in the Orlando area including Lynx Central Station in Downtown Orlando, Kissimmee, Orlando International Airport, SeaWorld Orlando, and Universal Orlando Resort.

<text>The S8G reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The S8G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 8 = Eighth generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== History ==
The S8G reactor was designed by General Electric for use on the s. The 220 MWth S8G reactor compartment for the Ohio submarines is in diameter, long and weighs 2,750 tons.

== Design ==
This nuclear reactor utilizes natural circulation which is capable of operating at a significant fraction of full power without reactor coolant pumps.

A land-based prototype of the reactor plant was built at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory&#x27;s Kesselring Site in West Milton, New York. The prototype was used for testing and crew training throughout the 1980s. In 1994, the core was replaced with an S6W reactor, designed for the then-new &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarine.

The prototype is equipped with an automatic reactor fill system that can flood the reactor with borated water in the event of a loss-of-coolant accident.

The S8G reactor is in use in Ohio Class Submarines and has a power rating of 26.1 MW.

<text>The Powerhouse Museum, formerly known as the Museum of Applied Arts &amp; Sciences (MAAS), is a collection of museums in Sydney, and owned by the Government of New South Wales. Its main centre is in Ultimo, New South Wales (Powerhouse Ultimo), the others being the historic Sydney Observatory at Observatory Hill, and the newer Powerhouse Castle Hill (previously known as the Museums Discovery Centre) at Castle Hill. Powerhouse Parramatta is due to open in 2025.

The Ultimo site was scheduled to be closed for three years from February 2024 for redevelopment.

Although often described as a science museum, the Powerhouse has a diverse collection encompassing all sorts of technology including decorative arts, science, communication, transport, costume, furniture, media, computer technology, space technology and steam engines.

The museum has existed in various guises for over 125 years, previously named the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum of New South Wales (1879–1882) and the Technological Museum (August 1893 – March 1988). the collection contains over 500,000 objects collected over the last 135 years, many of which are displayed or housed at the site it has occupied since 1988, and for which it is named – a converted electric tram power station in the Inner West suburb of Ultimo, originally constructed in 1902 and is a well-known and popular Sydney tourist destination. The Federation-style building is listed on the New South Wales Government&#x27;s State Heritage Register.

The Ultimo building, designed by Lionel Glendenning for the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, won the Sir John Sulman Medal for architecture. It includes a specially installed reticulated steam system, run from the old boiler house, to drive the large, rare steam machines in its collection.

==History==

The Powerhouse Museum has its origins in a recommendation of the trustees of the Australian Museum in 1878 and the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879 and Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880. The Sydney International Exhibition was held in the Garden Palace, a purpose-built exhibition building located in the grounds of the Royal Botanic Gardens. At the conclusion of the exhibition, the Australian Museum (Sydney&#x27;s museum of natural history) appointed a committee to select the best exhibits with the intention of exhibiting them permanently in a new museum to be sited within the Garden Palace. The new museum was to be called The Technological, Industrial, and Sanitary Museum of New South Wales; its purpose was to exhibit the latest industrial, construction and design innovations with the intention of showing how improvements in the living standards and health of the population might be brought about.

In September 1882, before the new museum could be opened a fire completely destroyed the Garden Palace, leaving the museum&#x27;s first curator, Joseph Henry Maiden with a collection consisting of only the most durable artefacts including a Ceylonese statue of an elephant carved in graphite that had miraculously survived the blaze despite a 5-storey plunge.

Maiden commenced rebuilding the collection, but for the subsequent decade the new museum found itself housed in a large tin shed in The Domain, a facility it shared with the Sydney Hospital morgue. The ever-present stench of decaying corpses was not the best advertisement for an institution dedicated to the promotion of sanitation. Eventually – after intense lobbying – the museum was relocated to a three-storey building; a temporary home at the Agricultural Hall in the Domain, a new, purpose-built premises in Harris Street, Ultimo and was given a new name: the &quot;Technological Museum&quot;.

The new location placed the museum adjacent to the Sydney Technical College, and as such it was intended to provide material inspiration to the students. As time passed, its name was changed to &quot;The Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences&quot; and it also established branches in some of New South Wales&#x27; main industrial and mining centres, including Broken Hill, Albury, Newcastle and Maitland. It also quickly outgrew the main Harris Street site and by 1978 the situation had become dire, with many exhibits literally stuffed into its attic, and left unexhibited for decades.

On 23 August 1978, Premier Neville Wran announced that the decrepit Ultimo Power Station, several hundred metres north of the Harris Street site had been earmarked as the museum&#x27;s new permanent home along with the adjoining former Ultimo Tram Depot. The museum spent an interim period exhibiting as the &quot;Powerhouse Museum – Stage One&quot; in the nearby tram sheds before re-opening as the &quot;Powerhouse Museum&quot; at the new site on 10 March 1988. The main museum building contains five levels, three courtyards and a cafeteria, as well as some offices. Workshops, library, storage and additional office space is located in the annexed tram sheds (still known in-house as &quot;Stage One&quot;). The size and continually expanding nature of the museum&#x27;s collection means that offsite storage facilities are also maintained.

The new Powerhouse made it possible to rehabilitate hundreds of treasures stored at Alexandria and &quot;exhibit them for the first time in almost a century&quot;. In 1982, the museum incorporated the Sydney Observatory. The museum moved to 500 Harris Street in March 1988, and took its new name from the new location.

Following its closure as a working observatory in 1982, Sydney Observatory was incorporated into the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, as the museum was still formally known, though from 1988 this name was no longer used in marketing materials in favour of the &quot;Powerhouse Museum&quot; brand.

===Planned relocation===
In February 2015, the State Government controversially announced that the Powerhouse Museum would be relocated to Parramatta. However this plan was reviewed, and an announcement from the NSW government in April 2017, suggested that the museum would stay in its current location. A decision to remain was announced on 18 July 2017. In 2018, the plan was revisited and the move was confirmed with a decision made to close the Ultimo site between June 2020, and early 2021. The final design for a new venue was unveiled in December 2019. The former site was to become a Broadway style theatre and fashion museum. In July 2020, the decision to close the site and relocate the collections was reversed.

The proposed new venue was larger than the old Powerhouse site in Ultimo, comprising 30,000 square metres, with about half (18,000 square metres) slated for exhibition and public space. The NSW Government promised to develop the new facility to international standards and engineered to present larger objects from the collection including the Catalina flying boat and Locomotive No.1 but proposals for lending the large items to different organisations across the state were in train since 2019, and concern persisted about risks, logistics and decontextualisation of exhibits.

The insecurity, the &quot;deluge of controversy&quot; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage sector made planning extremely difficult.

The proposed closure and move attracted wide-ranging criticism from museum experts, architectural heritage and urban design experts, cultural and business leaders, and the public on a number of grounds, including loss of cultural heritage, risk and cost. 

The main concerns expressed about the proposed move included:
* it would involve significant cultural destruction of existing heritage, including the architectural heritage of the original building as well as 19th century Italianate villa in Parramatta, known as Willow Grove, and a row of 19th century terraces
* the size and type of collection made its removal and/or relocation extremely expensive and risky
* closing or selling it involved a serious &quot;downgrading of public assets&quot;
* there was ongoing public and expert opposition, a survey by the National Trust (NSW), and a green ban on the destruction of Willow Grove was imposed by the NSW arm of the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) and the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives&#x27; Association
* the business case for a complete shutdown and move did not consider the option of leaving it at the current site
* the new venue was designed to be more of an event space than a museum, as most of the 500,000 items in the collection could not be displayed in it, especially the very large ones, given that the design contained numerous cafes and bars, but no storage space, conservation laboratories, sufficient goods lifts or environmental standards appropriate to a museum
* the proposed site for a new building was unsuitable as it is on a flood plain, which would affect the safety of the proposed undercroft and put patrons and collections at risk

=== Additional venue at Parramatta ===
On 4 July 2020, it was decided to keep and renovate the Ultimo building instead of demolishing it and relocating its collections, and build an additional venue in Parramatta. The NSW Premier said this would allow for &quot;an outstanding visitor experience in the areas of technology, science, engineering and design at two major locations&quot;, and that like other large collections such as the Smithsonian museums in the United States, multiple centres would display the institution&#x27;s collections. While Government Ministers argued the decision would be a &quot;win-win&quot; for Sydney and Parramatta, critics argued it would be a &quot;lose-lose&quot;, with both cities losing important heritage. On 29 July 2020, the NSW government announced it had abandoned plans to relocate three of the Powerhouse Museum&#x27;s biggest exhibits – the Boulton and Watt steam engine, the Locomotive No. 1, and the Catalina flying boat.

The planned three centres of Sydney&#x27;s Powerhouse Museum were the existing building at Ultimo, the Parramatta riverside, Museum Discovery Centre at Castle Hill and the Sydney Observatory. The decision to keep Ultimo site was made in the context of increasing public awareness of the cultural damage that would be done by closing the Powerhouse, along with the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage. The design of the Parramatta venue was subsequently amended by reducing the proposed presentation floor space and researcher apartments, along with a greater setback to the river. In March 2021, during heavy rains, the proposed area flooded for the second time in two years, and even with increased setback from the river, experts were concerned about irreparable damage from increased humidity to items in the collection, especially delicate ones made of paper, textile and wood.

In November 2020, revised plans to move Willow Grove &quot;brick by brick&quot; also created further controversy, with the National Trust advising that dismantling a building of such fragile materials would be an expensive and &quot;catastrophic&quot; failure.
Powerhouse Parramatta is due to open in 2025.

===Closure and redevelopment of Ultimo site===
In December 2023, Arts Minister John Graham announced that the Ultimo site would be closed from early February for up to three years, to allow for significant upgrades and redevelopment. A new public square is planned, and the entrance will be moved so that it faces The Goods Line walkway from Central Station.

On 5 February 2024, Powerhouse Ultimo began a period of temporary closure until 2027 for major redevelopment. Community consultations were due to run until 25 February 2024.

== Heritage listing ==
The statement of significance for the Federation building says the Powerhouse played a &quot;major part in the 20th-century development of the Ultimo/Pyrmont area and in the wider heritage conservation movement in NSW.&quot; and it was part of the Darling Harbour Bicentennial citywide adaptation project, incorporated into &quot;the transition of a major industrial location to a cultural, educational and tourism precinct&quot;.

==People==
In January 2019, Lisa Havilah, former director of Carriageworks, took up the position of CEO of MAAS. She became the fourth head of MAAS in 5 years. she is still in the role.

== Exhibits ==
The museum hosts a number of permanent exhibitions, including many concerning different modes of transport and communication.

=== Key attractions ===
The Powerhouse Museum houses a number of unique exhibits including the oldest operational rotative steam engine in the world, the Whitbread Engine. Dating from 1785, it is one of only a handful remaining that was built by Boulton and Watt and was acquired from Whitbread&#x27;s London Brewery in 1888. This engine was named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1986.

Another important exhibit is Locomotive No. 1, the first steam locomotive to haul a passenger train in New South Wales, built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company in 1854. The most popular exhibit is arguably &quot;The Strasburg Clock Model&quot;, built in 1887 by a 25-year-old Sydney watchmaker named Richard Smith. It is a working model of the famous Strasbourg astronomical clock in Strasbourg Cathedral (which at that time was called Strassburg or Strasburg). Smith had never actually seen the original when he built it but worked from a pamphlet which described its timekeeping and astronomical functions.

The Catalina Flying Boat &quot;Frigate Bird II&quot; on display in the museum is the one that Sir Patrick Gordon Taylor flew on the first flight from Australia to South America, in which he brought home 29 soldiers from New Guinea in 1945. It is the largest suspended plane in any museum in the world, and an example of the most successful flying boat ever introduced and one that was important in connecting Australia by air with the rest of the world after World War II. After involvement in the air-sea rescue squadron, the museum&#x27;s specimen flew from the Rose Bay flying boat base across the Pacific Ocean on the first uncharted air route between Sydney and Valparaiso, Chile. The use of Catalina flying boats by Qantas Empire Airways after World War II was significant in the development of Australia&#x27;s commercial air services.

=== Transport ===

The transport exhibition looks at transport through the ages, from horse-drawn carts through steam engines, cars and planes to the latest hybrid technology. On display is Steam Locomotive No. 1243, which served for 87 years, oldest contractor built locomotive in Australia. It stands beside a mock-up of a railway platform, on the other side of which is the Governor of New South Wales&#x27;s railway carriage, of the 1880s. Also in this exhibition is the original Central railway station destination board, relocated to the museum in the 1980s when the station was refurbished.

Powerhouse Museum restored the locomotives 3830, restored to operational order in 1997 and 3265, restored in 2009 after 40 years off the rails. Sydney&#x27;s last Hansom Cab was donated to the museum by its driver, who left it at the gates of the Harris Street building. There is also a horse-drawn bus and collection of motorbikes. Suspended aeroplanes, which can be viewed from balconies, include the Catalina flying boat and a Queenair Scout, the first Flying Doctor Service plane. Among the cars is a 1913 Sheffield Simplex, one of only 8 in the world. A four-minute film shows old footage of public transport.

The Powerhouse Museum also has Sydney trams C11 (1898), O805 (1909), R1738 (1938. 1st of its type), steam tram motor 28A, hearse car 27s and Manly horse car 292.

=== The steam revolution ===
This exhibition is remarkable in that nearly all of the engines on display are fully operational and are regularly demonstrated working on steam power. Together with the Boulton and Watt engine, and the museum&#x27;s locomotives, steam truck and traction engines, they are a unique working collection tracing the development of steam power from the 1770s to the 1930s. Engines on display include an 1830s Maudslay engine, a Ransom and Jeffries agricultural engine and the Broken Hill Fire Brigade&#x27;s horse-drawn pump-engine. The museum owns a collection of mechanical musical instruments, of which the fairground barrel organ is located in the steam exhibition, where it is powered by a small fairground engine.

=== Time and space ===

The most popular exhibit is arguably the museum&#x27;s model of the Strasbourg astronomical clock in Strasbourg Cathedral (which at that time was called Strassburg or Strasburg). The reproduction is a working model built between 1887 and 1889 by a 25-year-old Sydney watchmaker named Richard Bartholomew Smith, who had never actually seen the original when he built it but worked from a pamphlet which described its timekeeping and astronomical functions. The museum acquired it in 1890. Made from carved and painted wood with gold painted detailing, the clock displays the position of the planets, the days of the month, solar time, lunar phases and analog time.

The &quot;Space&quot; exhibition looks at space and discoveries relating to it. It includes a life size model space-shuttle cockpit. It has a feature on Australian satellites and joins the Transport exhibit through an underground temporary exhibit walkway and two side entrances.

The Powerhouse Museum has a 7 1⁄2-inch Merz Telescope that was manufactured in 1860–1861.

===Environment===
The &quot;EcoLogic&quot; exhibition focuses on the challenges facing the environment, human impact, and ways and technologies to stop this effect. There is a house setup called Ecohouse where people toggle light variables to see the outcome as well as other energy use simulators and a &#x27;ecological footprint&#x27; game. The exhibition includes a section of a tree with a time line marked on its rings, dating back to the 17th century.

=== Computers and connections ===

The &#x27;Interface: people, machines, design&#x27; explores how humans have been impacted by technology. A gallery of computing technology from the typewriter to the Tamagotchi. It explores successful and not-so successful design approaches made in the computing technology world.

=== Experimentations ===
&quot;Experimentations&quot; is a science exhibition and contains interactive displays demonstrating aspects of magnetism, light, electricity, motion and the senses. These include a machine that explains how chocolate is made and lets one taste four &#x27;stages&#x27; of chocolate. There is a full-sized model of the front of a firetruck that measures the pedal-power used to sound its horn and lights, and a hand-powered model railway using a magnetic system to provide electric current to the track. One of the most popular features is a plasma ball that shows the electric current through the glowing gas inside it, and changes when touched.

=== Art and industry ===
The museum holds an extensive and significant collection of Doulton ware and other ceramics, as well as industrial equipment and industrial design, such as furniture.

==Temporary exhibitions==
=== Australian popular culture ===

Various exhibitions have paid tribute to Australian popular culture. Some of these have included &quot;On the box: great moments in Australian television 1956–2006&quot; tribute to 50 years of Australian television and &quot;The 80s are back&quot; which looks back at life in Australia in the 1980s.

=== Arts ===
Arts oriented temporary exhibitions have included the Fabergé exhibition, the &quot;Treasures of Palestine&quot; exhibition, the &quot;Strictly Mardi Gras&quot; exhibition, the Christian Dior exhibition, the Audrey Hepburn exhibition, &quot;Kylie: an exhibition&quot; – a tribute to Kylie Minogue and her contribution to music, stage and screen, featuring many of her costumes. An exhibition about Diana, Princess of Wales, called &quot;Diana: a celebration&quot; included items from the collection at her ancestral home, Althorp, including her wedding gown, family jewellery and film of Diana as a child.

&quot;Harry Potter: The Exhibition&quot; in 2011–2012 was another popular exhibition, showcasing real costumes and sets from the eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films including the golden snitch, Nimbus 2000 and the Firebolt broomsticks, and various artefacts associated with all of the main characters.

In 2011, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Wiggles, the Powerhouse mounted &quot;The Wiggles Exhibition&quot;, which exhibited memorabilia from the group as well as from The Cockroaches, since two of the group were previously members of &quot;The Cockroaches&quot;. Due to its popularity, the exhibition was kept as one of the museum&#x27;s permanent exhibitions.

=== Cinema-themed ===
Since 1988, the Powerhouse hosted a number of large temporary exhibitions, including ones based on popular cinema franchises such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the &quot;Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination&quot; exhibition, showing models, props and costumes from all six &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, together with recent advances in technology that are turning fantasy into reality.

==Museums Discovery Centre==
About 95 percent of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences collection is maintained in storage at any one time. From late 2004, 60 percent of this was moved to a new site in the northwestern Sydney suburb of Castle Hill. Built at a cost of , this facility consists of seven huge sheds, including one the size of an aircraft hangar, within which are housed artefacts as a section of the mast of , Nelson&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, and the spare wheel from &quot;Bluebird-Proteus CN7&quot;, the car Donald Campbell drove to break the world land speed record on Lake Eyre in the 1960s.

<text>A barrel vault, also known as a tunnel vault, wagon vault or wagonhead vault, is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, in the case of a pointed barrel vault) along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of barrel roof.

As with all arch-based constructions, there is an outward thrust generated against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong – this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel down the length of the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.

Barrel vaults are known from the Ancient Iran (Elam), Indian Indus Valley Civilization and Ancient Egypt, and were used extensively in Roman architecture. They were also used to replace the Cloaca Maxima with a system of underground sewers. Other early barrel vault designs occur in northern Europe, Turkey, Morocco, and other regions. In medieval Europe, the barrel vault was an important element of stone construction in monasteries, castles, tower houses and other structures. This form of design is observed in cellars, crypts, long hallways, cloisters and even great halls.

==Theory and early history==

Barrel vaulting was known and utilized by early civilizations, including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. However, it apparently was not a very popular or common method of construction within these civilizations. The Persians and the Romans were the first to make significant architectural use of them. The technique probably evolved out of necessity to roof buildings with masonry elements such as bricks or stone blocks in areas where timber and wood were scarce. The earliest known example of a vault is a tunnel vault found under the Sumerian ziggurat at Nippur in Babylonia, ascribed to about 4000 BC, which was built from fired bricks amalgamated with clay mortar. The earliest tunnel vaults in Egypt are found at Requagnah and Denderah, from around 3500 BC in the predynastic era. These were built with sun-dried brick in three rings over passages descending to tombs with a span of only two metres. In these early instances, the barrel vault was chiefly used for underground structures such as drains and sewers, though several buildings of the great Late Egyptian mortuary palace-temple of Ramesseum were also vaulted in this way. Recent archaeological evidence discovered at the Morgantina site (in the province of Enna) shows that the aboveground barrel vault was known and used in Hellenistic Sicily in 3rd century BC, indicating that the technique was also known to ancient Greeks.

The vaulted roof of an early Harappan burial chamber has been noted from Rakhigarhi. S.R Rao reports vaulted roof of a small chamber in a house from Lothal. Barrel vaults were also used in the Late Harappan Cemetery H culture dated 1900 BC-1300 BC which formed the roof of the metal working furnace, the discovery was made by Vats in 1940 during excavation at Harappa.

Ancient Romans most probably inherited their knowledge of barrel vaulting from Etruscans and the Near East. Persians and Romans were the first to use this building method extensively on large-scale projects and were probably the first to use scaffolding to aid them in construction of vaults spanning over widths greater than anything seen before. However, Roman builders gradually began to prefer the use of groin vault; though more complex to erect, this type of vault did not require heavy, thick walls for support (see below), and thus allowed for more spacious buildings with greater openings and much more light inside, such as &quot;thermae&quot;.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, few buildings large enough to require much in the way of vaulting were built for several centuries. In the early Romanesque period, a return to stone barrel vaults was seen for the first great cathedrals; their interiors were fairly dark, due to thick, heavy walls needed to support the vault. One of the largest and most famous churches enclosed from above by a vast barrel vault was the church of Cluny Abbey, built between the 11th and 12th centuries.

In 13th and 14th centuries, with the advance of the new Gothic style, barrel vaulting became almost extinct in constructions of great Gothic cathedrals; groin vaults reinforced by stone ribs were mostly used in the beginning, and later on various types of spectacular, ornate and complex medieval vaults were developed. However, with the coming of the Renaissance and the Baroque style, and revived interest in art and architecture of antiquity, barrel vaulting was re-introduced on a truly grandiose scale, and employed in the construction of many famous buildings and churches, such as Basilica di Sant&#x27;Andrea di Mantova by Leone Battista Alberti, San Giorgio Maggiore by Andrea Palladio, and perhaps most glorious of all, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, where a huge barrel vault spans the -wide nave.

==Engineering issues==
With a barrel vault design the vectors of pressure result in a downward force on the crown while the lower portions of the arches realise a lateral force pushing outwards. As an outcome this form of design is subject to failure unless the sides are anchored or buttressed to very heavy building elements or substantial earthwork sidings. For example, at Muchalls Castle in Scotland, adjacent walls to the barrel vaulted chambers are up to thick, adding the buttressing strength needed to secure the curved design.
The inherent difficulty of adequately lighting barrel vaulted structures has been widely acknowledged. The intrinsic engineering issue is the need to avoid fenestration punctures in stonework barrel vaults. Such openings could compromise the integrity of the entire arch system. Thus the Romanesque medieval builders had to resort to techniques of small windows, large buttresses, or other forms of interior wall cross-bracing to achieve the desired lighting outcomes. In many of the monasteries, a natural solution was cloisters which could have high barrel-vaulted construction with an open courtyard to allow ample lighting.

Since 1996 structural engineers have applied Newtonian mechanics to calculate numeric stress loads for ancient stonework barrel vaults. These analyses have typically used a finite element algorithm to calculate gravity induced stresses from the self weight of an arched system. In fact, for structural engineers, analysis of the barrel vault has become a benchmark test of a structural engineering computer model &quot;because of the complex membrane and inextensional bending states of stress&quot; involved.

In terms of comparison to other vaulting techniques, the barrel vault is inherently a weaker design compared to the more complex groin vault. The barrel vault structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin vault design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the apexes.

==In unconventional usage==
Beyond the classical use of the barrel vault in macro-architectural design (e.g. as a major structural roofing element), there are a variety of derivative applications clearly based on the original concept and shape of the barrel vault. These applications arise in the fields of surgery, skylight design, children&#x27;s toys and microstructure design (such as bus shelters). While none of these applications rival the majesty of the ancient and Classical predecessors, they demonstrate the pervasiveness of the barrel vault as an architectural concept in contemporary times.

In the field of bone surgery the technique of a &quot;barrel vault&quot; shaped incision is not only a well-defined state-of-the-art surgical procedure, but the name &quot;barrel vault&quot; is given to this technique by orthopedic surgeons. The Wohlfahrt study cited documents results of this surgical procedure on the human tibia in 91 such operations.

<text>Kunqu (), also known as Kunju (), K&#x27;un-ch&#x27;ü, Kun opera or Kunqu Opera, is one of the oldest extant forms of Chinese opera. It evolved from a music style local to Kunshan, part of the Wu cultural area, and later came to dominate Chinese theater from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It has been listed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. refined the musical style of kunqu, and it gained widespread popularity when Liang Chenyu used the style in his drama &quot;Huansha ji&quot; (&quot;Washing Silken Gauze&quot;). In 2006, it was listed on the first national intangible cultural heritage list. In 2008, it was included in the List of Representative Works of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In December 2018, the General Office of the Ministry of Education announced that Peking University is the base for inheriting excellent traditional Chinese culture in Kunqu.

Kunqu takes drum and board to control the rhythm of singing, with Qu flute, three strings and so on as the main accompanying instrument; its singing pronunciation is &quot;Zhongzhou Rhyme.&quot;

==History==
Kunqu refers to Kunshan tune (昆山腔, &quot;Kūnshān qiāng&quot;), a repertory of songs and performances from Kunshan in Suzhou. The Kunshan tune is often believed to have been developed during the Ming Dynasty by (魏良輔), who was from the port of Taicang. A more recent discovery, however, suggests that Kunshan tune was introduced in the late Yuan dynasty by Gu Jian (顾坚), who developed an early form of Kunqu with a group of musicians in Kunshan. Wei modified Kunshan tune with songs of Haiyan (海鹽) near Hangzhou and Yiyang (弋陽) of Jiangxi; he also combined &quot;nanxi&quot; rhythms, which often used flute, with the northern &quot;zaju&quot; style, where plucked string instruments were preferred. The resultant elegant Kunshan tunes are often called &quot;water mill&quot; tunes (水磨調, &quot;shuimo diao&quot;).
Kunqu operas are &quot;chuanqi&quot;-style operas but incorporating Kunshan tune throughout. An opera, &quot;Washing Silken Gauze&quot; (浣紗記, &quot;Huan Sha Ji&quot;) written by a Kunshan native Liang Chenyu (梁辰魚), has been described as the first Kunqu opera. The story of &quot;Washing Silken Gauze&quot; was based on &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue&quot;, and the use of elegant &quot;water mill&quot; tunes in the opera earned it wide praise from scholars. Kunqu operas then became popular throughout China, and the emergence of Kunqu is said to have ushered in a &quot;second Golden Era of Chinese drama.&quot;

The most famous Kunqu opera is &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; written by Tang Xianzu in the Ming dynasty. Other important works include &quot;The Palace of Eternal Life&quot; written by Hong Sheng, and &quot;The Peach Blossom Fan&quot; by Kong Shangren written in the early Qing period. The operas were not necessarily performed in full, but may be performed as excerpts or highlights (折子戲, &quot;zhézixì&quot;), which became the norm by 1760s and over 400 pieces of these were known.
Kunqu performance influenced the performance of many other styles of Chinese musical theater, including Peking opera, which contains much Kunqu repertoire. Kunqu was referred to as Yabu (雅部, &quot;elegant drama&quot;), and it came under competition from a variety of operas (e.g. Shaanxi Opera, Clapper Opera, Yiyang tunes, Peking Opera, etc.) termed Huabu (花部, &quot;flowery drama&quot;), and as a result, Kunqu troupes experienced a commercial decline in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, the elite tried to re-establish Kunqu, and the Academy was founded in 1921 to train performers. It was later subsidized by the Communist state, but like most traditional forms of Chinese opera, Kunqu was banned during the Cultural Revolution. Kunqu began to revive by the mid-1990s, and it was then declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2001, and received generous support by the government, and experienced a great increase in popularity by 2004.

Today, Kunqu is professionally performed in seven major Mainland Chinese cities: Beijing (Northern Kunqu Theater), Shanghai (Shanghai Kunqu Theater), Suzhou (Suzhou Kunqu Theater), Nanjing (Jiangsu Province Kun Opera), Chenzhou (Hunan Kunqu Theater), Yongjia County/Wenzhou (Yongjia Kunqu Theater) and Hangzhou (Zhejiang Province Kunqu Theater), as well as in Taipei. Non-professional opera societies are active in many other cities in China and abroad, and opera companies occasionally tour.

In 1919 Mei Lanfang and Han Shichang, renowned performers of &quot;Kunqu&quot;, traveled to Japan to give performances. In the 1930s, Mei performed &quot;Kunqu&quot; in the United States and the Soviet Union and was well received.

Its melody or tune is one of the Four Great Characteristic Melodies in Chinese opera.

In 2006, Zhou Bing acted as a producer and art director for &quot;Kunqu&quot; (Kun Opera) of sexcentenary. It won Outstanding Documentary Award of 24th China TV Golden Eagle Awards; it won Award of TV Art Features of 21st Starlight Award for 2006.

Kunqu Opera is a rarity in the traditional culture and art of the Han nationality in China, especially in the art of opera. It is called an &quot;orchid&quot; in the hundred gardens.

Kunqu Opera is a blend of singing, dancing and martial arts. It is known for its elegant lyrics, graceful style and delicate performance. It is one of the operas under the Southern Opera system, known as the &quot;ancestor of hundred operas.&quot; Kunqu Opera uses drum and plate to control the rhythm of singing, and Qudi and three-stringed instruments as the main accompaniment instruments. Its pronunciation is &quot;Zhongzhou rhyme.&quot;

== Recognition ==
Kunqu Opera was listed as a masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2001, and was included in the Masterpiece of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.

In December 2018, the General Office of the Ministry of Education announced Peking University as the base of Kunqu Opera excellent traditional Chinese Culture Inheritance.

Kunqu opera was showcased in the 2019 Chinese Opera Culture Week on Oct 2, 2019.

== Characteristics ==

Kunqu Opera is characterized by the character line cavity, cavity with the character walk. Singing also has a certain cavity, different from other operas can be given free play according to the individual conditions of the actors. Instead, there are four strict determinations: tone, cavity, plate and spectrum.

The main difference between Nankun and Beikun is not the geographical location of the troupe, but whether the music is southern or northern. Kunqu Qupai music can be divided into vocal qupai and instrumental Qupai according to its different uses.

The biggest feature of Kunqu opera performance is strong lyricism, delicate movements, and the combination of singing and dancing is ingenious and harmonious. Kunqu opera is a comprehensive art of song, dance, mediation, and white performance, and the performance characteristics of singing and dancing have been formed in the long-term performance history, especially reflected in the performance body of each character, and its dance body can be roughly divided into two types: one is the auxiliary posture when speaking and the dance of rewriting the intention developed by gestures; One is a lyrical dance with singing lyrics, which is not only a superb dance move, but also an effective means to express the character&#x27;s character and the meaning of the lyrics.

The opera dance of Kunqu Opera has absorbed and inherited the traditions of ancient folk dance and court dance, and has accumulated rich experience in the close integration of rap and dance through long-term stage performance practice. To meet the needs of the performance venue of narrative writing, many dance performances that focus on description are created, and cooperate with &quot;drama&quot; to become a folding drama with a strong story. Adapted to the needs of the performance venue with strong lyricism and movement, many lyrical dance performances have been created, which have become the main performance means of many single-fold lyric song and dance.

The Nianbai of Kunqu Opera is also very characteristic, because Kunqu Opera was developed from Wuzhong, so its voice has the characteristics of Wu Nong soft language. Among them, Harlequin also has a local white based on the Wu dialect, such as Su Bai, Yangzhou Bai, etc. This market language in the Wuzhong area, has a strong sense of life, and often uses Allegro-style rhyme white, which is very distinctive. In addition, the singing of Kunqu opera has extremely strict specifications for the sound of words, lines, rhythm, etc., forming a complete singing theory.

=== Industry ===
Kunqu opera is divided into three categories: sinian horn, fresh horn and pure clown.

Because the early Kun opera belongs to the Southern Opera system, it inherits the role industry system of the Southern Opera, and simultaneously absorbs the long of the Northern Zaju, taking the basic roles of Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mei, Chou, outer and paste seven acts.

Huan Sha Ji, an early work, reflects the character branch method in the early stage of Kun Opera. In addition to following the seven lines of Southern Opera, it also borrowed the setting method of Xiao Mei and Xiao Dan in Yuan Zaju, and added five lines of Xiao Sheng, Xiao Dan, Xiao Mei, Xiao Wai and Xiao Jing, a total of twelve lines.

During the boom of Kun opera in the late Ming Dynasty, in the Ming edition of the legend of Mohan Zhai, the original &quot;tie&quot; was changed to &quot;Old Dan,&quot; which also absorbed the branch method of Zaju in the Yuan Dynasty. Other roles are basically the same as Kun opera in the early period. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, The role industry of Kun opera basically maintained the system of &quot;twelve characters in rivers and lakes.&quot;

During the reign of Qianlong, Kunqu Opera was the most popular, the performing arts were further improved, and new breakthroughs were made in the role industry system for characterizing characters.

With the development of performing arts, the division of roles in Kun opera has become more and more detailed. Between Jia and Dao, the role industry of Kun opera combines the original &quot;twelve roles in rivers and lakes&quot; with the later more detailed division of labor. Under the five lines of &quot;Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo and Chou,&quot; there are twenty smaller lines, called &quot;twenty doors.&quot;

Traditional Kun opera professional class clubs usually only have 18 actors, commonly known as &quot;18 nets,&quot; while only a few large class clubs have 27 actors. General class club as long as ten doors complete, can perform, other roles can be replaced by close to the door of the actor, the ten basic door is known as the &quot;ten court column,&quot; they are: net, official health, cloth health, old age, end, Zhengdan, five Dan, six Dan, vice, ugly. Some of the most readily recognizable qualities of performance are: net, old, official students, Zhengdan four doors.

Each line of Kun opera has developed its own set of procedures and techniques in performance. These stylized action language has formed a complete and unique performance system of Kunqu Opera in terms of characterizing characters, expressing characters&#x27; psychological states, rendering drama and enhancing appeal.

=== Stage art ===
It includes three aspects: rich clothing styles, exquisite colors and decorations, and .

In addition to inheriting the costume styles of opera characters since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, some costumes of Kunqu opera are very similar to the clothes that were popular in society at that time. Reflected in the play, military generals have their own uniforms, and civil officials also have a variety of clothes according to the class hierarchy of feudal society. Facebook is used for the two lines of net and ugly. Very few characters belonging to Sheng and Dan are also used by chance, such as Monkey King (生) and Zhong Wuyan (Dan), and the colors are basically red, white, and black.

After years of running-in processing, Kunqu opera art has formed a fairly perfect system, and this system has long occupied a dominant position in Chinese opera, so Kunqu opera art is revered as the &quot;ancestor of a hundred operas,&quot; which has a profound impact on the development of the entire opera, and many local operas have absorbed its artistic nutrients to varying degrees, among which there are still some Kunqu operas.

== Significance ==
Kunqu Opera is the oldest existing drama form in China with a complete performance system, which has had a profound influence on later Chinese operas.

Chinese opera has been spreading on the stage since its formation. With the change of time, the script, the voice and the performance are constantly changing. Kunqu Opera, on the other hand, is known as a &quot;living fossil&quot; with less changes and more traditional features of traditional operas. It is the only one of the three ancient operas in the world that has been preserved so far. It is also the representative of the traditional culture and art of the Han nationality.

== By region ==
Due to the extensive performance activities of Kunban, in the last years of Wanli, Kunqu opera was introduced to Beijing and Hunan through Yangzhou, ranking first among all voices and becoming the standard singing tone of legendary scripts: &quot;Four Square Songs Must Zong Wumen.&quot; At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, Kunqu opera spread to Sichuan, Guizhou and Guangdong, and developed into a national drama. The singing of Kunqu opera was originally based on the Wu language pronunciation of Suzhou, but after it was introduced to various places, it was combined with local dialects and folk music to derive many genres, forming a rich and colorful Kunqu opera cavity system, and becoming a representative opera of the whole nation. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the development of Kunqu opera entered its heyday, and since then Kunqu opera has begun to dominate the pear garden, which has lasted for six or seven hundred years, becoming the oldest existing form of opera with a long tradition in China and even the world.

The Kunshan singing began to spread its area, initially limited to the Suzhou area, and during the Wanli period, it expanded to the south of the Yangtze River and north of the Qiantang River with Suzhou as the center, and also flowed into Beijing at the end of the Wanli period. In the Qing Dynasty, the Kangxi Emperor loved Kunqu opera, which made it even more popular. In this way, the Kunshan singing became the most influential vocal cavity drama from the middle of the Ming Dynasty to the middle of the Qing Dynasty.

=== Fujian ===
 The earliest recorded introduction of Kunshan dialect into Fujian was in 1574. Kunqu Opera is widely distributed in Fujian, and has had some influence on local operas in Fujian more or less, directly or indirectly. In the Confucian drama founded by at the end of Ming Dynasty, the main vocal cavity, &quot;Douqiang,&quot; contains the components of Kunshan dialect. For example, the representative opera &quot;Ziyuchai,&quot; the main tune is &quot;13 tunes.&quot; Kunqu Opera also appears in the folk form of sitting and singing. 

=== Zhejiang ===
Kunqu Opera, commonly known as &quot;Cao Kun&quot; and &quot;Jin Kun,&quot; is a Kunqu opera spread in the Jinhua area of Zhejiang. It is called &quot;Cao Kun&quot; because of its simplification or change of local customs in language and melody. Since the Ming Dynasty, it has been regarded as the authentic opera of Wu opera. In fact, Kunqu Opera is a tributary of Quzhou and Jinhua.

<doc id="618731" wikidata="Q1165721" url="?curid=618731" title="Muffler">
<text>A muffler (North American and Australian English) or silencer (British English) is a device for reducing the noise emitted by the exhaust of an internal combustion engine—especially a noise-deadening device forming part of the exhaust system of an automobile.

==Operation==


Mufflers are installed within the exhaust system of most internal combustion engines. Mufflers are engineered as an acoustic device to reduce the loudness of the sound pressure created by the engine by acoustic quieting. Sound reduction techniques used in mufflers include: reactive silencing, resistive silencing, absorptive silencing, and shell damping. The noise of the hot exhaust gas exiting the engine can be abated by a series of passages and chambers lined with roving fiberglass insulation and/or resonating chambers harmonically tuned to cause destructive interference, wherein opposite sound waves cancel each other out.

The operation of an internal combustion engine produces distinct pulses of exhaust gas that exit through the exhaust pipes and the muffler. For example, a four-cylinder engine will have four high-pressure pulses for each operating cycle, a six-cylinder engine will emit six high-pressure pulses, and so on. These pulses are separated by a low-pressure between them which functions as a scavenging mechanism for the next exhaust cycle from the cylinder. The exhaust system needs negative pressure waves so they help empty the cylinder of gases. The more distinct separate pulses in the exhaust system, the more positive the exhaust flow, and the more efficiently the exhaust gas is scavenged from each cylinder.

The design of the exhaust systems and mufflers must compromise effective exhaust gas extraction and exhaust gas pressure, engine fuel efficiency and power, as well as noise suppression. A side effect of noise reduction is the restriction of the exhaust gas flow, which creates back pressure, which can decrease engine efficiency. This is because the engine exhaust must share the same complex exit pathway built inside the muffler as the sound pressure that the muffler is designed to mitigate. However, having some back pressure helps. Higher backpressure can also help nitrous oxides (NOx) emission reduction in some engines.

When engine performance is the main concern, the exhaust pipes and muffler should be large enough to facilitate breathing as well as small enough to create a high exhaust flow. The objective of a muffled high-performance exhaust system depends on two independent factors: &quot;the pressure wave tuning from length/diameter selection, and minimizing backpressure by selecting mufflers of suitable flow capacity for the application.&quot;

Some aftermarket mufflers claim to increase engine output and/or reduce fuel consumption by slightly reduced back pressure. This usually entails less noise reduction (i.e., more noise). Greater muffler flow may increase engine power, but excess muffler flow capability provides no additional benefits and can be more expensive as well as being noisier.

==Regulations==
On May 18, 1905, the state of Oregon passed a law that required vehicles to have &quot;a light, a muffler, and efficient brakes&quot;.

The legality of altering a motor vehicle&#x27;s original equipment exhaust system varies by jurisdiction; in many developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, such modifications are highly regulated or strictly prohibited.

<text>Admiral Arend Dickmann (1572 – 28 November 1627) was a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy officer. Born in Delft to a Dutch family, he led the Polish–Lithuanian navy to victory in the 1627 Battle of Oliwa during the Polish–Swedish War, but was killed in action.

== Early life ==

Arend Dickmann was born in Delft, Netherlands in 1572. Since 1608, he lived in Gdańsk, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he was the captain and owner of a merchant ship that transported cereal and oak wood.

== Military career and death ==

In 1626, he joined the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy during the Polish–Swedish War. On 24 November 1627, he was given the rank of admiral, becoming the commander-in-chief of the navy. He served aboard the fleet flagship &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot;. On 28 November 1627, he commanded the fleet during the Battle of Oliwa, a major encounter during the war, that was fought in the Gdańsk Bay. During the battle, his ship had attacked and boarded the enemy galleon &quot;Tigern&quot;. The fight aboard the ship ended with a Polish victory and the capture of the vessel. Dickmann also forced the crew of another Swedish warship, &quot;Solen&quot;, to scuttle their vessel. &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot; had also fired from the broadside, hitting the enemy galleon Pelikanen. Dickmann had died at the end of the battle, aboard the &quot;Tigern&quot;, being hit with a stray round shot, that was probably shot from the enemy Pelikanen, or in friendly fire from &quot;Fliegender Hirsch&quot;. &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot; itself sustained the damages in the battle, including being hit 3 times below the waterline.

== Funeral ==

He was ceremonially buried on 2 December 1627 in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Gdańsk. The funeral was financed by the king Sigismund III Vasa. Before his coffin marched 33 pairs of bound Swedish prisoners of war. The coffin was accompanied by a marine guard of honour, royal officials, and members of the City Council. The coffin was laid to rest in the northern wall of the chancel, near the Saint John chapel.

<doc id="618735" wikidata="Q2392380" url="?curid=618735" title="2004 Austrian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Austria on 25 April 2004. While the post of President of Austria is a largely ceremonial one, presidential elections are conducted on a party basis and are seen as a test of the relative standing of the major parties.

The victorious candidate was Heinz Fischer of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ). He defeated Benita Ferrero-Waldner, foreign minister in the ruling conservative coalition led by the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP).

== Campaign ==
The campaign started in January 2004 with the announcements of Ferrero-Waldner and Fischer that they would run. Several other candidates also announced their intention to run, but they were not supported by a major party, their campaigns went virtually unnoticed by the media, and they failed to get the required 6,000 signatures supporting their candidacy.

A notable exception was Franz Fiedler, head of the National Audit Office. In late February he announced that he was considering a candidacy, and that he had the support of important but unnamed politicians. Conventional wisdom held that he had no chance of getting a majority, but that his candidacy would force a run-off between Ferrero-Waldner and Fischer. But since his financial supporters were unwilling to reveal their names, he decided not to run.

In advance of the campaign the ÖVP and the SPÖ agreed on a &quot;Fairness Pact,&quot; with compliance to be supervised by a panel of three people, headed by Ludwig Adamovich, former head of the Constitutional Court.

The first complaint before the panel was brought by the SPÖ, who claimed that the ÖVP had stolen one of their slogans. The panel decided that this was not fair according to community standards, but not specifically forbidden by the Fairness Pact. Both parties hailed this decision as a victory for their own side.

Later, both sides complained that the other side had given out presents of tangible value (mainly chocolates) at rallies; the panel refused to consider these claims. Other complaints (commercials during the agreed-upon Easter break, tearing down and defacing posters) were withdrawn.

== Platforms ==
Fischer&#x27;s campaign praised their candidate&#x27;s experience as President of the Parliament, his expertise in constitutional law, and his proven ability to negotiate compromises. Ferrero&#x27;s campaign suggested that as a dedicated socialist Fischer might not always show the neutrality required from a Federal President.

Ferrero&#x27;s campaign pointed to her international connections, her language abilities (English, French, Italian, Spanish), and her performance as foreign minister during the period of the European Union sanctions against Austria. Fischer&#x27;s campaign claimed that she had made many mistakes as a foreign minister, and expressed the fear that a conservative president would not be an appropriate counterweight to a conservative government.

In the beginning of the campaign, polls suggested a 15% lead for Fischer: during the campaign Ferrero narrowed the margin, but polls never showed a decisive lead for her.

== Results ==
In the 2002 parliamentary elections the conservative parties (the ÖVP and the Freedom Party of Austria, FPÖ) received 52 percent of the votes, compared to 46 percent for the SPÖ and the Greens. In this election, however, many conservative voters stayed at home, and this (together with Fischer&#x27;s high personal popularity) was the reason for the lower number of votes for Ferrero. The turnout of slightly above 70% of registered voters was considered low by Austrian standards.

<text>Sergey Ivanovich Belyavsky (; December 7, 1883 (Julian calendar: November 25) – October 13, 1953) was a Soviet/Russian astronomer and a discoverer of 36 numbered minor planets.

His last name is also alternatively spelled Beljavskij (name under which the Minor Planet Center credits him) or Beljawskij. His first name is occasionally given as &quot;Sergius&quot;. He was born in St. Petersburg and was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. His field of work included astrophotometry, astrometry, and the study of variable stars. He died in Leningrad.

He discovered the bright naked-eye comet C/1911 S3 (Beljawsky), also known according to the nomenclature of the time as &quot;Comet 1911 IV&quot; or &quot;Comet 1911g&quot;. Belyavsky observed at Simeiz Observatory (Симеиз) in Crimea. Between 1937 and 1944, Belyavsky was the seventh director of the Pulkovo Observatory, where he succeeded Boris Gerasimovich.

<doc id="618744" wikidata="Q902536" url="?curid=618744" title="Dave Cockrum">
<text>David Emmett Cockrum (; November 11, 1943 – November 26, 2006) was an American comics artist known for his co-creation of the new X-Men characters Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, and Mystique, as well as the antiheroine Black Cat. Cockrum was a prolific and inventive costume designer who updated the uniforms of the Legion of Super-Heroes and the X-Men in the 1970s and early 1980s.

==Early life==
Cockrum was born on November 11, 1943, in Pendleton, Oregon. His father was a lieutenant colonel of the United States Air Force, resulting in the Cockrums frequently transporting their household from one city to another for years. Cockrum discovered comic books at a young age; an early favorite was Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, especially Mac Raboy&#x27;s Captain Marvel Jr. Other artists whose work the young Cockrum admired were Wally Wood, Gil Kane, Murphy Anderson, and Joe Kubert.

As a young man, Cockrum was a dedicated &quot;letterhack,&quot; who had many letters printed in comic book letter columns such as &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #22 (Jan. 1964), &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #12 (May 1964), &quot;The Atom&quot; #1 (June 1962), and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #36 (March 1965) (return address &quot;YN &#x27;A&#x27; School, USNTC&quot;). A letter from Cockrum in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #34 (Jan. 1965) led to a correspondence with Andrea Kline, who later became his first wife.

Cockrum&#x27;s ambition was to become a comic-book creator himself. After attending but not graduating from Southern Illinois University, Cockrum joined the United States Navy for six years. During this time, he created the character Nightcrawler, though the character would not be used until years later.

==Career==
Despite serving during the Vietnam War, Cockrum found time to contribute artwork to comics fanzines such as &quot;Star-Studded Comics&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Fanzine&quot;.

After leaving the military, Cockrum found employment with Warren Publishing, as well as with Neal Adams&#x27; Continuity Associates as a member of the &quot;Crusty Bunkers&quot;.

He was then hired as an assistant inker to Murphy Anderson, who was inking various titles featuring Superman and Superboy for DC Comics. At the time, &quot;Superboy&quot; featured a &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; backup strip. When the position of artist for &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; was left vacant, Cockrum sought the job and was rewarded with his first assignment drawing a feature. Cockrum&#x27;s work on the feature, beginning with a backup story in &quot;Superboy&quot; #184 (April 1972) and recurring in several following issues &quot;established an exciting new vibe&quot;. He remained the artist on the &quot;Superboy&quot; series after the Legion of Super-Heroes became the main feature of the book with #197 and his art redefined the look of the Legion, creating new costumes and designs that would last until artist Keith Giffen did a similar revamp in the 1980s. Cockrum is credited with creating team member Wildfire. Cockrum drew the story wherein the characters Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel were married in &quot;Superboy Starring the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; #200 (Feb. 1974). Cockrum eventually left DC and the &quot;Legion&quot; in a dispute involving the return of his original artwork from that issue.

Prior to his departure, Cockrum had been preparing to be the regular artist on an ongoing Captain Marvel Jr. back-up strip in the &quot;Shazam!&quot; series for DC.

===Marvel and the X-Men===
Moving over to a staff position at Marvel, Cockrum and Len Wein under the direction of editor Roy Thomas created the new X-Men, co-creating such characters as Storm, Nightcrawler, and Colossus. Storm and Nightcrawler were directly based on characters which Cockrum had intended to introduce into the Legion of Super-Heroes storyline had he remained on the title. These characters made their debut in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 ([July] 1975), and then in a relaunched &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; (beginning with issue #94).

Cockrum stayed with the title until 1977 (as main penciler on issues #94–105 and 107), when he was succeeded by penciler John Byrne with issue #108. The final issue of his original, regular run introduced the Starjammers, a spacefaring superhero team he had originally intended to debut in their own series. Issue #110, which Cockrum co-pencilled with Tony DeZuniga, was an inventory issue. He continued to contribute covers for the series until &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #126.

As journalist Tom Spurgeon wrote about Cockrum&#x27;s X-Men,
In 1979, Dave Cockrum designed Black Cat for writer Marv Wolfman. Cockrum quit his staff job at Marvel in 1979 and his angry resignation letter was printed without his permission in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #127 (October 1979) but he continued to work for Marvel as a freelancer. Cockrum was Marvel&#x27;s primary cover artist during this period, and also penciled or inked a number of other titles for DC during this time. Although not a regular artist on the series, he re-designed the costume for Ms. Marvel. When John Byrne left the &quot;X-Men&quot; in 1981, Cockrum returned to the title with issue #145 but left again with issue #164 (Dec. 1982) to work on &quot;The Futurians&quot;.

He returned to the X-Universe in 1985 with a four-part &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; limited series that he wrote as well, a two-part &quot;Starjammers&quot; limited series in 1990 and an X-Men short story for &quot;Marvel Holiday Special&quot; #1 in 1991. Two unpublished fill-in issues that Cockrum pencilled in the early 1990s for &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;New Mutants&quot; respectively were released together posthumously as the one-shot &quot;X-Men: Odd Men Out&quot; in 2008.

In 1983, Cockrum produced &quot;The Futurians&quot;, first as a graphic novel (&quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #9), and then as an ongoing series published by Lodestone Comics. Though it did not last past issue #3, a collected edition was published by Eternity Comics in 1987 that included the &quot;missing&quot; issue #4. In 1995, Aardwolf Publishing printed the &quot;missing&quot; issue as &quot;Futurians&quot; #0, with a new five-page story by Cockrum and author Clifford Meth.

===Claypool Comics===
In 1993, Cockrum was recruited by Claypool Comics to produce work for them, resulting in several stories for Claypool&#x27;s &quot;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark&quot; series beginning with #7. Cockrum was put into rotation on Peter David&#x27;s &quot;Soulsearchers and Company&quot;, beginning with issue #13, becoming the series&#x27; penciler with #17 and penciling most issues through #44, published in 2000. Cockrum contributed a short feature to Richard Howell&#x27;s &quot;Deadbeats&quot; #18.

==Personal life, illness, and death==
While serving in the Navy in the late 1960s, Cockrum married Andrea Kline and had a child with her, Ivan Sean.

Dave and Paty Greer Cockrum were married on April 28, 1978.

In later years, Cockrum worked less frequently in comics. In 2004, he became seriously ill due to complications from diabetes and pneumonia, and a number of fellow artists and writers led by Clifford Meth and Neal Adams organized a fundraising project. The auction, run by Heritage Auctions at the WizardWorld Chicago show in August, raised over $25,000. Marvel eventually provided an undisclosed amount of financial support in exchange for Cockrum agreeing to terms protected by a nondisclosure agreement. Cockrum said publicly he was &quot;very happy that so many people cared about my work and about me. ... I&#x27;m enormously grateful to Clifford Meth and Neal Adams for having moved this forward. ... I&#x27;m very happy with what everyone has done, including Marvel.&quot;

Cockrum was due to draw an eight-page story in &quot;Giant Size X-Men&quot; #3 (2005), but a recurrence of his health problems prevented this. Adams filled in.

Cockrum died at his home in Belton, South Carolina, on the morning of November 26, 2006, due to complications from diabetes. He was survived by his longtime wife, Paty Cockrum, and by his son and two stepchildren.

===Legacy===
The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art bestowed the first annual Dave &amp; Paty Cockrum Scholarship to a promising artist in 2008. The scholarship, which was organized by Meth, continues each year and is funded by sales of comics from Cockrum&#x27;s personal collection.

In the novelization of &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, written by Cockrum&#x27;s longtime associate Chris Claremont (published in 2006), the President is named &quot;David Cockrum&quot;. Claremont also created a character in homage to Cockrum in &quot;New Exiles&quot; who eventually &quot;moved on&quot; at the end of &quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot; (2007), which ended with a full-page tribute to Cockrum.

==Awards==
Cockrum&#x27;s work on the &quot;X-Men&quot; earned the creative team an Eagle Award for Favourite (Colour) Comic in 1977. Cockrum received an individual Inkpot Award in 1982.

<text>The R-16 was the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile deployed by the Soviet Union. In the West it was known by the NATO reporting name SS-7 Saddler, and within Russia, it carried the GRAU index 8K64.

==Description==
The missile was 30.4 m long, 3 m in diameter and had a launch weight of 141 tons. The maximum range was 11,000 km with a 5–6 Mt thermonuclear warhead and 13,000 km with a 3 Mt warhead. The missile had a circular error probable (CEP) of 2.7 km.

==History==

During development, a massive failure occurred on October 24, 1960, when a prototype rocket exploded on the pad killing an estimated 54300 personnel. After decades of coverup, the government finally revealed this incident in 1989, referred to as the Nedelin catastrophe. A fatal accident with the R-9 missile occurred exactly three years later, causing October 24 to be referred to as Baikonur&#x27;s &quot;Black Day.&quot; No launches have been attempted on that date at Baikonur ever since.

After the delays associated with the deaths of many people working on the project, the first flight of the missile took place on 2 February 1961. Initial operational capability was achieved on 1 November 1961. The missile continued to serve until 1976, with maximum deployment numbers reached in 1965 with 202 missiles deployed. The Soviets had fewer than 50 of these missiles deployed in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It is possible that only around 20 interim R-16 launchers were operational during the height of the crisis.

The R-16 was a true first-generation intercontinental missile and a vast improvement over the largely experimental &#x27;zeroth&#x27; generation R-7 Semyorka. The missile used a hypergolic bipropellant combination of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) fuel in combination with red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) oxidiser. The Soviets initially deployed it at soft sites which were not shielded from nuclear attack. On normal duty the missiles were stored in hangars, and it took one to three hours to roll them out, fuel them, and reach launch readiness. The missiles could remain fueled for only a few days due to the corrosive nature of the nitric acid. After this, the fuel would have to be removed and the missile sent back to the factory for rebuilding. Even when fueled and in an alert posture, the Soviet missiles still needed to wait up to twenty minutes to spin up the gyroscopes in their guidance systems before launch was possible. Despite these shortcomings, the R-16 was unquestionably the first truly successful intercontinental ballistic missile developed by the Soviet Union.

The Soviets were aware of the missile&#x27;s vulnerability, and from 1963 onward some R-16U missiles were based in silos, with around 69 silo launchers put into service. Each launch complex consisted of three silos clustered together for economic reasons to allow them to use a common refueling system, making them vulnerable to a single U.S. missile.

The control system of this rocket was designed at OKB-692 (Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR).

==Operator==
;: The Strategic Rocket Forces were the only operator of the R-16.

<doc id="618766" wikidata="Q492225" url="?curid=618766" title="Tribes 2">
<text>Tribes 2 is a first-person shooter multiplayer video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in 2001 as a sequel to &quot;&quot;.

== Setting ==
Set in the year 3941 of the fictional universe, &quot;Tribes 2&quot; allows the user to play as a soldier in one of several factions (referred to in the game as tribes), namely the Children of the Phoenix, the Blood Eagle, the Diamond Sword, and the Starwolf. Players can also choose to play a rebelling human-created soldier/worker race called the BioDerms. None of the factions differ from each other in strengths or weaknesses, but each has a distinctive look and background story.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Tribes 2&quot; is a multiplayer online game, designed for Internet or LAN play with up to 128 players (64 vs 64) or bots per match, although a small single-player tutorial mode is included. The game may be played from both first- and third-person perspectives. Each match takes place on an Earthsiege-themed map. The &quot;Tribes 2&quot; engine, an early version of the Torque Game Engine, is capable of both indoor and outdoor maps, with expansive play areas. Player movement about the map may be on foot, using a jet pack, or in various ground and airborne vehicles as pilot, co-pilot, or passenger.

Each match is played according to one of a number of possible game modes, which dictate the rules of the match. These modes include Capture the Flag, deathmatch, Rabbit, Arena, Hunters, Siege, Gauntlet, and Bounty. Players are free to choose their own role, and may deploy various items of weaponry, vehicles, and emplacements. Many of these items can be left unattended to operate automatically, or control may be assumed by players. Each player may also choose from three armor types (which trade off various abilities, e.g. weak but fast, strong but slow, or median), and a weapon and equipment loadout, which may be reconfigured at any time during a match.

The large variety of equipment and deployable items results in many opportunities for creative play and tactics, from pure combat to stealth. &quot;Tribes 2&quot; gameplay makes extensive use of jet pack-powered flight, which adds a notable vertical element to combat, and a skiing action to slide down slopes. As such, playing style varies dramatically from player to player, and from moment to moment, but &quot;Tribes 2&quot; gameplay may be generalized as being fast-paced three-dimensional combat over a wide playing area. Player vs player combat is a central element of &quot;Tribes 2&quot; gameplay, even in team-based modes.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Tribes 2&quot; was developed by Dynamix as a sequel to &quot;&quot;. Mötley Crüe recorded a song for the game that was never released with the game.

On November 2, 2008, Sierra/Vivendi disabled the authentication servers required for its online multiplayer and dropped all official support for the Tribes franchise.

In early 2009, a fan community project provided an unofficial patch and replacement server which restored online multiplayer functionality.

The Torque 3D game engine, on which &quot;Tribes 2&quot; is built, was released by GarageGames under the MIT license on September 20, 2012. The &quot;Tribes 2&quot; source code beside the Torque engine was not made available.

Published by Sierra On-Line, it was released for Microsoft Windows in North America on March 29, 2001, in Europe on April 13, 2001, and in Japan on June 22, 2001 (where it was published by Capcom). A Linux port was released by Loki Entertainment on April 19, 2001.

On November 20, 2002, Sierra released an update for &quot;Tribes 2&quot;. This update contained two new game types, new maps and updates to address several issues. Sierra, which was then part of Vivendi Universal Games, licensed the franchise to Irrational Games for a third installment; &quot;&quot; was released in October 2004.

In an effort to increase interest in the upcoming sequel, Sierra released both the original &quot;Starsiege: Tribes&quot; and &quot;Tribes 2&quot; as freeware download on May 4, 2004.

In 2015, the game was released as freeware by Hi-Rez Studios.

== Reception ==
&quot;Tribes 2&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Kevin Rice of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;It&#x27;s not terribly friendly toward newbies, and the system requirements are stiff, but &quot;wow&quot;... There&#x27;s nothing else this incredibly good for team-based multiplayer mayhem.&quot; Human Tornado of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;Tribes&quot; veterans will want to pick up &quot;Tribes 2&quot;, but newbies will need some patience to enjoy the game.&quot;

The game was commercially successful. Its sales had surpassed 200,000 units and were steadily rising by the time of Dynamix&#x27;s closure in November 2001, according to the company&#x27;s Dave Georgeson. Sales in North America alone reached 245,069 units by the end of 2001, according to PC Data. This amounted to $9.7 million in revenue. In August 2006, &quot;Edge&quot; declared it the U.S.&#x27; 70th best-selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all &quot;Tribes&quot; computer games released between those dates had reached 480,000 units in the U.S. by August 2006.

==Early life==
Wiest was born in Kansas City, Missouri. Her mother, Anne Stewart (&quot;née&quot; Keddie), was a nurse. Her father, Bernard John Wiest, was a college dean and former psychiatric social worker for the U.S. Army. Her parents met in Algiers. Wiest has two brothers, Greg and Don. She attended high school at Nurnberg American High School in Germany. Her ambition was to be a ballet dancer, but she switched her goal to theater during her senior year. Wiest graduated from the University of Maryland in 1969 with a degree in Arts and Sciences.

==Career==
===Stage===

Wiest left her theater studies in Maryland after the third term in order to tour with a Shakespearean troupe. Later, she had a supporting role in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of &quot;Ashes&quot;. She also acted at the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, playing the title role in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. She was an understudy both off-Broadway and on Broadway, in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot; in 1970.

She made her Broadway debut in Robert Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Solitaire/Double Solitaire&quot;, taking over in the role of the daughter in 1971. She landed a four-year job as a member of the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in such roles as Emily in &quot;Our Town&quot;, Honey in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, and leading roles in S. Ansky&#x27;s &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, Maxim Gorky&#x27;s &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;. She toured the USSR with the Arena Stage. In 1976, Wiest attended the Eugene O&#x27;Neill National Playwrights Conference and starred in leading roles in Amlin Gray&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; and Christopher Durang&#x27;s &quot;A History of the American Film&quot;. At Joe Papp&#x27;s Public Theater she took over the lead in &quot;Ashes&quot;, and played Cassandra in &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, directed by Andrei Șerban. In 1979, she originated the role of Agnes in &quot;Agnes of God&quot; in its first production in Waterford, Connecticut.

She appeared in two plays by Tina Howe: &quot;Museum&quot; and &quot;The Art of Dining&quot;. In the latter, Wiest&#x27;s performance as the shy and awkward author Elizabeth Barrow Colt won three off-Broadway theater awards: an Obie Award (1980), a Theatre World Award (1979–1980), and the Clarence Derwent Award (1980), given yearly for the most promising performance in New York theatre.

On Broadway she appeared in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1981), directed by Tom Moore, portrayed Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot; (1982) opposite James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer and co-starred with John Lithgow in Christopher Durang&#x27;s romantic screwball comedy &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; (1982), directed by John Madden. (She played opposite Lithgow again in the Herbert Ross film &quot;Footloose&quot;). During the 1980s, she also performed in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, directed by Lloyd Richards at Yale Repertory Theatre, and in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot; (1984, Manhattan Theatre Club), Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Serenading Louie&quot; (1984), and Janusz Glowacki&#x27;s &quot;Hunting Cockroaches&quot; (1987, Manhattan Theater Club). As Wiest became established as a film actress through her work in Woody Allen&#x27;s films, she was less frequently available for stage roles. However, she did appear onstage during the 1990s, in &quot;In the Summer House&quot;, &quot;Square One&quot;, Cynthia Ozick&#x27;s &quot;The Shawl&quot;, and Naomi Wallace&#x27;s &quot;One Flea Spare&quot;. In 2003, she appeared with Al Pacino and Marisa Tomei in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;. In 2005, she starred in Kathleen Tolan&#x27;s &quot;Memory House&quot;. She also starred in a production of Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s final play &quot;Third&quot; (directed by Daniel Sullivan) at Lincoln Center.

Later New York theater roles include performances as Arkadina in an off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Seagull&quot; (opposite Alan Cumming&#x27;s Trigorin) and as Kate Keller in a Broadway revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;, opposite John Lithgow, Patrick Wilson, and Katie Holmes. In 2009, Wiest appeared in the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with Katie Holmes celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño. Wiest spent September 2010 as a visiting teacher at Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program, working with a group of 18 first-year MFA Acting students on selected plays by Anton Chekhov and Arthur Miller.

In 2016, Wiest took on the role of &quot;Winnie&quot; in The Yale Repertory Theatre&#x27;s production of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Her early screen roles include small roles in &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot; (credited onscreen as Diane Wiest) and &quot;I&#x27;m Dancing as Fast as I Can&quot;, both starring Jill Clayburgh in the lead roles. In 1984, she starred in &quot;Footloose&quot;, as the reverend&#x27;s wife and Ariel&#x27;s mother. Under Woody Allen&#x27;s direction, Wiest won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; in 1995.

<text>Mark Farmer (born 1957 in Birmingham) is a British comic book artist. He is best known as an inker, often working with Alan Davis.

==Career==
Farmer got his start in the UK comics industry before becoming part of the British Invasion, the wave of UK creators that were an integral part of the DC Comics &quot;new look&quot; of the 1980s

He is primarily known these days as an inker, although he has done some pencilling as well (for instance, collaborating with writer Len Wein on an early 1980s run on &quot;Green Lantern&quot;). Like nearly all those involved in the British Invasion, Farmer got his start at the British weekly comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;, where he pencilled such series as Judge Dredd and Anderson: Psi Division.

Farmer usually forms a team with writer/penciler Alan Davis. The pair, who first teamed on 1987&#x27;s D.R. and Quinch for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, have worked together on such titles as Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;Avengers&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. For DC their work includes &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;JLA&quot; as well as cover work on Green Lantern. He also helped co-write &quot;Gen13: Bootleg&quot;.

In 2004, Farmer inked John Byrne&#x27;s pencils on &quot;&quot; a graphic novel written by former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson. It reimagines the origin of Superman, by considering how Clark Kent&#x27;s upbringing would be different if his spaceship had crashed in England instead of the fictional town of Smallville.

Farmer has also inked other pencillers, such as Dale Keown and Brandon Peterson.

In 2012 Farmer was awarded the Inkwell Award for Favorite Inker.

<doc id="618785" wikidata="Q3538751" url="?curid=618785" title="Tribes (video game series)">
<text>Tribes is a series of five science fiction first-person shooter video games released between 1998 and 2024. The game plot is set in the far future (2471 – 3940). The series includes &quot;&quot;, &quot;Tribes 2&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Tribes 3: Rivals&quot;. Tribes is a spin-off series from the mecha simulation series &quot;&quot;.

== Plot ==
The &quot;Tribes&quot; series begins in 2471, when scientist Solomon Petresun invents the first cybrid, a bio-cybernetic hybrid artificial intelligence named Prometheus. Based on its design, thousands of cybrids are mass-produced as slaves. By 2602, Prometheus grows wary of humans and rallies all cybrids against humanity.

In &quot;Starsiege&quot;, the Terran resistance manages to drive Prometheus&#x27; forces out of Earth and onto the Moon where they are believed to be eliminated by General Ambrose Gierling and his squad&#x27;s suicide attack. Prometheus, however, survives the assault, fleeing into deep space. To counter this threat, Petresun (having technically achieved immortality through his studies) proclaims himself the Emperor of Mankind in 2652 and succeeds in unifying and rebuilding the Terran civilization. Pursuing his goal of fortifying the Earth against the inevitable cybrid retaliation, Petresun ruthlessly exploits Martian and Venusian colonies, spawning massive resistance movements among the colonists by 2802.

The chronologically first game in the &quot;Tribes&quot; series is &quot;&quot; which was released in 2004. Set some time between the 33rd and 40th century, it shows the Great Human Empire, now ruled by &quot;Imperial King&quot; Tiberius, having hunted down (almost) all remaining cybrids and expanded beyond the boundaries of the Solar system through the so-called &quot;Interstellar Transfer Conduit&quot;. While the Empire itself is prosperous, there are outcasts, known as &quot;the Children of Phoenix Weathers&quot;, whom they consider their progenitor. Their insubordination has made the Empire dispatch a great force of elite Imperial Knights, the Blood Eagles, against them, however, by the time of &quot;Tribes: Vengeance&quot;, the Eagles have fully embraced the Tribal way of life, considering themselves Tribesmen despite still having ties to the Empire.

The next (chronologically) game in the series, &quot;&quot;, 1998, sees the conflict between the Blood Eagles, the Children of Phoenix, and other tribes formed by the renegades of these two (such as the Star Wolf and the Diamond Sword) escalating into countless blood feuds before finally culminating in the devastating Tribal Wars about 3940.

The sequel, entitled &quot;Tribes 2&quot;, 2001, deals with the insurgent uprising of &quot;BioDerms&quot;, a new race of warriors/workers created by the Empire to replace the cybrids, and their assault on the &quot;Wilderzone&quot;, the space frontier where the Tribes mostly reside.

&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; do not significantly contribute to the plot of the series.

== Releases ==

==History==
=== Dynamix ===
&quot;Starsiege: Tribes&quot; was released in December 1998.

A single player version called &quot;Tribes Extreme&quot; began development shortly after the release of &quot;Starsiege: Tribes&quot;, but was abandoned before completion.

&quot;Tribes 2&quot; added additional vehicles (such as a two-person tank and a three-person bomber with a belly turret), weapons, and items. A few details of gameplay were changed; for instance, the original game made a player choose his load out while he was at a supply station (sometimes resulting in long lines to use the station), while the sequel required the player to choose his load out before he used the station. &quot;Tribes 2&quot; also included many features to help its community of players: it included user profiles, interactive chat areas, and message boards. The initial release of &quot;Tribes 2&quot; was plagued by bugs and slow performance on release. While a very stable build existed as late as 1 month before release, several changes were introduced in the last several weeks of development that compromised stability on most systems configurations. Several patches were released over the following year (first by Dynamix, later by GarageGames) to address these issues, including a day 0 patch that had to be run after installation before the game could be played.

===Cancelled games===
In December 1999, Sierra cancelled an upcoming game in the series titled &quot;Tribes Extreme&quot;.

&quot;Tribes: Fast Attack&quot; was cancelled in 2002.

=== Inevitable Entertainment ===
&quot;Tribes: Aerial Assault&quot; was a PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Tribes 2&quot;. Developed by Inevitable Entertainment and published by Sierra, it offered simplified but significantly swifter gameplay (fewer maps and vehicles, and a subset of the original&#x27;s voice commands) and network support for up to sixteen players at a time.

=== Irrational Games ===
&quot;Tribes: Vengeance&quot; is a prequel to the other games, was released in October 2004. In addition to multiplayer support, it featured a full single-player game with a storyline. It was developed by Irrational Games using a heavily modified Unreal Engine to bring the game&#x27;s appearance up to par with other modern first-person shooters. This new Tribes largely de-emphasized the focus on massive maps and slower gameplay that was typical of &quot;Tribes 2&quot; in favor of the swifter action of the original, battles were faster-paced, and teamwork and vehicles were less necessary. &quot;Tribes: Vengeance&quot; was released with almost no marketing support shortly after the release of Doom 3 and Far Cry and just before the releases of Half-Life 2 and Halo 2. Sales were predictably poor. After six months, only 47,000 copies of the game had been sold. In March 2005, all support for &quot;Tribes: Vengeance&quot; was dropped, including a planned patch that would have addressed several bugs and added PunkBuster support.

=== InstantAction ===
InstantAction announced &quot;PlayTribes&quot;, a planned browser-based version of &quot;Starsiege: Tribes&quot;, in March 2009 along with their acquisition of the &quot;Tribes&quot; intellectual property. An open beta was scheduled to release that summer but was continually pushed back. The game was shown publicly in September 2009 at PAX in a relatively playable state, but was eventually canceled after InstantAction sold the Tribes IP to Hi-Rez Studios in October 2010.

=== GarageGames ===
In February 2006, GarageGames &quot;leaked&quot; short videos of a tech demo which featured &quot;tribes like&quot; game play on their Torque Shader Engine. The demo made its debut at the 2006 GDC as &quot;Legions&quot;, an allusion to the &quot;Tribes&quot; series for which the team is famous for. Announced officially in 2007 as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to &quot;Tribes&quot;, &quot;Fallen Empire: Legions&quot; was marketed to the public in June 2008 on InstantAction, with development being handed over to the community after InstantAction was shut down in November 2010.

=== Hi-Rez Studios ===
On October 23, 2010, Hi-Rez Studios announced that they had bought the Tribes IP from InstantAction. Hi-Rez Studios released , a multiplayer-only successor to Tribes 2 for the PC on April 12, 2012.

&quot;Tribes Universe&quot; was a massively multiplayer online shooter developed by Hi-Rez Studios. The game, along with Hi-Rez Studios&#x27; &quot;Tribes&quot; IP acquisition from InstantAction, was first announced on October 23, 2010. While alpha testing was said to begin at the start of 2011, development on &quot;Tribes Universe&quot; was canceled when Hi-Rez Studios decided to start working on &quot;Tribes: Ascend&quot;.

Hi-Rez has been criticized by gaming communities for their handling of &quot;Tribes: Ascend&quot; and &quot;Global Agenda&quot;. In 2013, Hi-Rez Studios announced they would stop releasing updates for both games, but planned to maintain active servers and customer support. Hi-Rez Studios did eventually come back to &quot;Tribes: Ascend&quot; in late 2015 and released several patches. The final patch for Tribes: Ascend was released in September 2016.

In 2015 Hi-Rez announced that in celebration of the Tribes franchise 21st anniversary, all games in the franchise (starting with 1994&#x27;s Metaltech: Earthsiege) would be free to download on the &quot;Tribes Universe&quot; webpage.

=== Prophecy Games ===
In 2019, Hi-Rez sold rights to the Tribes IP to a subsidiary, which by early 2020, Hi-Rez had spun off, forming the independent studio Prophecy Games.

In May 2023, Prophecy Games started alpha tests for Starsiege: Deadzone. The in-game menu for Deadzone displayed 3 different games, one of which titled &#x27;Starsiege Tribes&#x27;, with a Q1 2024 release date below it. Little was known about the game, other than the developers stating it is indeed a new official entry into the series. A Q&amp;A with one of the developers briefly spoke about the game, stating it would have Light, Medium, and Heavy classes, and also feature cross-progression with the other games.

In November 2023, Tribes 3: Rivals was announced.

<text>The Bride Stripped Bare is a 2003 novel by the Australian writer Nikki Gemmell, originally published anonymously. The title is borrowed from the painting &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even&quot; (also known as &quot;The Large Glass&quot;) by Marcel Duchamp. It went on to become the best-selling book by an Australian author in 2003.

In 2005, it was announced that Australian screenwriter Andrew Bovell, who penned the award-winning film drama, &quot;Lantana&quot;, was to adapt &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot; for the screen.

The book is written in the form of a diary by a young wife who has disappeared. In it, the author talks frankly about oral sex and love, and chronicles her relationship with a mysterious man she meets at a library group.

The author has said that she &quot;loved the idea of writing a book that dived under the surface of a woman&#x27;s life, a seemingly contentedly married woman, and explored her secret world-with ruthless honesty&quot;. The act of writing the work anonymously, she has described as &quot;liberating&quot;.

A follow-up novel entitled &quot;With My Body&quot; was published in Australia and the UK in October 2011 and was scheduled to be published in the United States in 2012. According to the publisher, it is a companion piece but not explicitly a sequel to &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare&quot;.
